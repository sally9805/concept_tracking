saw that she was already across the room to greet an arrival , and he felt a stab of jealousy . " Eloise has been telling me about you , " Mr. Dilworth was saying in a firm , hospitable tone as he stirred the contentsof the big shaker . " She was terribly keen about your book . I 'm ashamed to say I have n't read it . You know how it is , the practice of law does n't leave much time for that sort of thing . But Eloise read some passages aloud to me which I thought were excellent . Although , if you do n't mind my saying so , I thought you handled your soldiers better than you did your officers . I gather you were in the Pacific . No picnic , was it ? " Carl could only mutter assent to this . The strength and candor of the man were as overwhelming as his assumptions . He felt relegated immediately , with a friendly but firm push , to the category of Eloise 's world , the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature , of babies and music , a world severed from Mr. Dilworth 's downtown by a gap so wide that even their joint membership in the great club of the Pacific war could not heal it . He drank two cocktails while Mr. Dilworth told him about life on Admiral Halsey 's staff . " There 's a lot of bitterness about the war now , " Mr. Dilworth was saying , " which is inevitable when you take several million young men who 've never taken an order before in their lives and suddenly stuff them into uniform . Of course , they assume that everyone at headquarters is goofing off . The over-all planning is too big to be apparent to any one unit . But speaking for the staff I was on  --  " The room was beginning to fill , and other people joined them to interrupt the flow of Mr. Dilworth 's reminiscence.  |p81Carl  was duly introduced to Mr. Irwin and told about his new publishing venture . He was immediately disgusted that Eloise should have held out this as bait to him , that she should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that any author would be glad to meet Mr. Irwin . He turned away only to be caught again by the firm hand of Mr. Dilworth and taken over to be introduced to Mrs. Bleecker , a palefacedlady in black with large , angular features . A Modigliani . The latter 's eyes opened wide . " But you 're the writer , " she said as Mr. Dilworth moved away . " I 'm afraid I read only French novels , but I know about you , of course . What in the name of heaven are you doing here ? Is this Irwin man going to publish you ? " " Lord no . Mrs. Dilworth asked me . " " Eloise ? " Her stare became incredulous . " You mean , she wrote you a fan letter ? " " Of course not . I happen to know her . What 's so odd about that ? " " Where did you meet ? " He laughed . " Now just a minute , Mrs. Bleecker . " He held up his hand . " Why are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman have any secrets from her friends ? " Mrs. Bleecker leaned closer to him and smiled conspiratorially . " I hope she has , Mr. Landik , " she said insinuatingly . " I hope there are lots of things about Eloise I do n't know . For her sake , anyway . Pour a little of that drink of yours into mine , will you ? That 's a good boy . I 'm on probationhere . If George catches me taking more than one , he 'll probably throw me out . " He tipped his glass into hers.  | " Is n't that a bit rough ? " " Well , I wo n't say it 's entirely without cause , " she said , raising her replenished drink and winking at him . " Though George is stuffier than a cushion , I grant . Oh , they all are . It takes someone who has lived to see that . You must come and see me in my little apartment at the Stafford , Mr. Landik . I can give you lots of good materialfor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore , too . He was tired of women who thought their own promiscuity was the staple of fiction . Hell , he was n't exactly a virgin himself . " What about Eloise ? What could you tell me about her ? " She looked mysterious . " I thought you were the one who knew her secrets , Mr. Landik . " " Me ? No . I was only supposing that she had them . As a matter of fact , I should think there might be a whole novel in Eloise . " " A novel ? " She considered it . " No , not a novel . Perhapsa series of pale , still sonnets . Lovely . And unread . " He felt suddenly irritated . Like Lorna , she would concedeEloise nothing . " I 'd read them , " he said truculently . " Well , do n't be so defensive about it , " she reproved him . " It 's always tiresome when people go on the defensive . You think I 'm criticizing Eloise . I 'm not , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life on this side of the Atlantic . Now in Paris , Mr. Landik  --  " Carl suddenly lost his temper . It was not so much at the ridiculous creature before him as at Eloise for exposing himp83to her . First he was expected to hear Mr. Dilworth on the Pacific , now Mrs. Bleecker on the Atlantic . And the excuseof it all was the privilege of meeting Arthur Irwin ! He turned abruptly away from her and walked over to the door of the dining room . He caught Eloise coming back alone from the pantry . " Are you having a nice time , Mr. Landik ? " " A nice time ! What do you expect ? Do you really think I want to stay here and listen to that old woman sneer at how uncultivated Americans are ? I thought that had gone out with Henry James . " " Oh , dear . What old woman ? " He jerked his head towards the corner of the living room where Mrs. Bleecker was staring after him . Eloise gave a rather desperate laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't . I 'm sorry . That 's my mother . She 's rather a dose , is n't she ? " " Oh . " His temper collapsed . " I 'm sorry . I had no idea she was your mother . God . Shall I go and apologize ? " " No , no , Mr. Landik , do n't give it a thought , " she said hastily but obviously meaning it . " Irene will survive . She may even like you for it . That 's the way she is . " He looked at her blankly , at her nervous , smiling eyes . " Why do you give these things , anyway ? " he went on , exasperated at his own break and confusion . " Do you really like them ? " " George does . It 's business . " " Why ask me , then ? What am I supposed to do ? Stand on my head ? " He saw that he had hurt her , but it only exasperated him the more.  | " I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadly . " I thought you 'd think it was stupid if it was just me . " " Try it sometime . " " Oh , do you mean it ? " she asked , her eyes widening . He turned away , impatient with her humility , with his own concession . " Of course I mean it . Why should n't I ? But can I go now ? Please ? " " Dear boy , of course you can go . " She turned and led him out into the hall . " But promise me one thing , " she added as she opened the front door for him . " Promise that you wo n't lump me with all the rest in there . " She indicatedthe living room . " Try to remember that I 'm different . At least in one way . " " Are you different ? " he asked . " How are you different ? " " I understand you . " She was looking at him now in that peculiar way that he remembered from Mogue . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She waved her hand again towards the room . " To them you 're a writer . Your novel is a novel . It 's like other things to them . " " Except none of them have read it . " " Would it be any better if they had ? " She smiled as she said this and nodded . " Good night , Mr. Landik . " When she closed the front door behind him Eloise stood by herself for several moments in the dark vestibule , lookingblankly at her own startled eyes in the mirror over the hall table . She could n't go back to the party until she had calmed down . That was obvious . But what was more obviousstill was that she did n't want to calm down ; she wanted , on the contrary , to be alone so that she could study and afterwards remember each symptom of this ex/citement that had caught her : the constriction around her heart , the breathlessness , the smothered impulse to justify the amazement in her eyes by opening her mouth and singinginto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could concede , without in the least begrudging the concession , that might have been less intense had he not left when he had , had he lingered on , for example , to dissolve the impression that he had come to the party , not to see Arthur Irwin or George or any of the friends or even out of a writer 's curiosity to see what they were like , but simply and purely to see her . Her ! That had been the unbelievablething , the moment when she had realized this , the moment that had proved that she had not , after all , made a complete ass of herself at Mogue , the moment when she had reached a timid hand through the mild mist in which , as Irene would have put it , she habitually lived , to touch , at long last , another human being . Going to the living-room doorway she gazed more criticallyinto the crowded room . How George loved that room . For it was certainly the most expensive thing they had ever done . One could relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Storey Beach , but in the city a standard had to be maintained . With its bright chintz and Chinese rug , with the open shelves in the built-in bookcases for the Wedgwood and the amber gleam of the Phyfe chairs , with all its sustained neatness and harmony it jumped at her every morning , bright and harmonious , as from a page in House and Garden . But now that Carl had been there and had filled it with himself and his characters , until then figures only of her fantasy , it seemed as soulless and unthreateningas a small , expensive cocktail suite rented for ap86business party at a large hotel . She even smiled as she caught sight of Irene huddled in a corner with the guest of honor , talking excitedly and gesticulating with her hands . Mr. Irwin was sitting quite still , listening to her with a reserved , slightly distrustful look , but she could still make out the curiosity in his cold green stare , that stare that showed the American accumulator behind the pink cheeks of what , at first meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have struck one as an almost Pickwickianold gentleman . Oh , it was all right , she told herself , he was amused . And supposing he was n't ? Would the world come to an end ? Was n't it even all right if Irene , as she could hardly doubt , was only monopolizing him to irritate George ? " Eloise ! " It was the tone of a headmaster on vacation , uncomfortably playful . " Eloise , you have n't addressed a word to me all afternoon ! You have n't so much as concededthat I might even be here ! " She turned , with a forced smile , to the bulky figure of Harry Hamilton , standing alone , watching her , a whiskey drink in one hand and a cigar in the other . A little grin flickered under the great aquiline nose and the shining baldness of his round head . " I am indeed remiss , " she answered , falling , as she always did , into his habit of speech , more to appease him than to amuse herself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Harry was the kind of fat man who made his weight formidable instead of grotesque . A bachelor partner of George 's , he was also his greatest admirer and looked out for him with the sometimes patronizing , sometimes servile , but always fussing attention of the vain man who is notp87accustomed to emotional dependency . He took it as axiomaticthat he knew better than Eloise what was best for her husband , and he had always managed , without a hostile word and despite his rather cumbersome compliments , to make her feel that her timid overtures to him were basicallyunacceptable . " You mean , perhaps , the lesser literary lights , " he came back at her . " For I observe that the Dilworth salon has taken on a literary flavor . Not perhaps as yet bohemian , but we can hope , ca n't we ? " " You mean Mr. Irwin ? Do you find him bohemian , Harry ? " " No , Eloise , " he said with a patient , knowing smile , " I do n't mean Arthur Irwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a mixed sensation of anger and fear . He had put her , as he always did , in the position of the recalcitrant child from whom the truth must be extracted by firm but gentle pulls . She gazed over his round bulging black eyes at his more vulnerable dome . " Oh , you mean Mr. Landik , " she said as casually as she could . " He 's nice , is n't he ? Did ! you meet him ? " " No , I did not meet him , " Harry answered with a slow shake of his head , as though it was quite obvious that this , too , she must have known . " But I identified him . From the jacket cover of his book . " " Identified him , Harry ? You make him sound like a criminal ! " " There may be those who would argue that the author of his last piece of pornography is neither more nor less , " he said blandly , inserting his cigar carefully between his teeth.  | " But I pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and George frequented the four-letter-word circles of the literaryworld . " " You know perfectly well we do n't , " she retorted , angry with herself for even denying it . " I happened to meet Mr. Landik this summer , that 's all . And I liked him , Harry , as you would if you 'd only  --  . " " This summer ! " Harry exclaimed , his eyes widening . " In Storey Beach ? I would have hardly thought it a communityto attract a young man of his type . Is he a friend of your Uncle Gerald 's ? " " No , Harry , of course not , " she said impatiently . " It was n't at Storey Beach at all . " " But you did spend the summer at Storey Beach ? " he asked , dropping his voice and raising his eyebrows as he would in court with a difficult witness . " Of course , I did . But that does n't mean I was glued there . I met Mr. Landik at Mogue . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was what he had been building up to . " I confess , my dear Eloise , that if it surprises me to think of Landik in Storey Beach , it surprises me even more to think of you in Mogue . Do you go there often ? " Her sense of the witness stand was suddenly intolerable . " Oh , Harry , you 're impossible ! " she cried , slapping her hands together . For a second they stared at each other , equally amazed at the violence of her outburst . " Impossible , Eloise ? " he asked with hurt , ponderous dignity . " You wo n't even permit me my little joke ? " So there she was again , a fool.  | " I 'm sorry , Harry , " she said , turning away from him . " I seem to be nervous today . " It was uncanny what he could do to her . She was tremblingall over as she crossed the room . Not only was her good mood quite gone , but she was worried again by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying himself , how George was feeling about the party , what Irene in another whim of temper might take it upon herself to do . Was it such a good thing , she wondered bitterly , that there were people in the world like Carl to open windows if there were always Harrys to slam them shut ? ON HIS WAY home from the Dilworths ' Carl stopped at Lorna 's . He was stirred up by the party and his own reactions to it , and he wanted to talk . Finding her and Henry at supper , he sat with them and told them about it . " The funny thing about people like Mr. Dilworth is that they are n't simply bored with me . They 're fundamentally hostile . " " Naturally . They hate writers . Essentially , they hate all artists . " " But why , Lorna ? Why should they ? " " Because you make them feel they might be missing something in life . That 's why they want you to conform ,  |p90to  be like them . Think how admiringly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salesman or a doctor . " Henry looked up at her . " You think I should become an insurance salesman , dear ? " he asked bleakly . Lorna turned her big eyes on him in loving reproof . " Do n't be an idiot . You 're a genius , and that 's different . " She turned back to Carl . " But seriously , Carl , you have to watch your step . If you hang around with people like that they 'll make you do all the things they can do better than you . Like the English and their hunting . You end up either by becoming ridiculous or by becoming one of them . Or both . " " You mean it 's a conspiracy ? " " In a way . An unconscious conspiracy . " " But even if what you say is true , " he protested , " it does n't fit Eloise . Eloise is different . " Lorna laughed . It was not a nice laugh . " My dear boy , " she said mockingly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is that Eloise wants ? " Carl was upset by this remark and thought it over duringthe next two days . He knew , of course , that Lorna was possessive about the young writers whom she gathered around her , but still , she was nobody 's fool , and women could sense these things about other women . The idea , however , was oddly unpleasant . Though he found Eloise attractive , older than himself , of course , but still attractive , he preferred to think of their relationship as  --  well , a platonicone . He flushed at the thought of what Lorna would say to that . She , of course , would say it was corny . But then who in hell cared what Lorna said ? There werep91plenty of women for sex ; he had never had trouble with that . And damn it all , he liked to think that a woman like Eloise , the wife of a successful man , a mother , all that , should value so highly , perhaps more highly than anything else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agony of other confused young men in the hot horror of the Pacific war . But now , if all it was was the other thing , if she was just another bored society woman out for a jag , excited at the prospect of an affair with a young writer whom people talked about , well , hell , sure she could have it , yes , but it was a letdown . And as for her friends , that smug , superior crowd , was that the way they thought of him , as Eloise 's little boy , Eloise 's pet ? He worked himself up into such an angry mood that he decided to ask her to lunch with him in the Village to show her that he could still wear a blue shirt open at the neck and a coat with a belt in back . When she came , of course , she never noticed his clothes . They met in a small Italian restaurant and sat in the back by a window that looked out on the yard and the soft glare of the autumn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down from time to time to pat the small grey poodle which sat obediently at her feet . She seemed to sense his constraint ; she talked on , without waiting for his comments , about her childhood and the dreams she had once had for her life and how foolish they seemed now , how she had wished to be a singer , an actress , to run for Congress , to be watched and loved and praised . She laughed at herself and said that , of course , she had known all along she had been destined for just what she was . She was nervous , he could see , at their first meal alone , andp92there was a slight note of self-consciousness in her tone , but it was not too , much , not really , and she was lovely to watch , dressed in grey like the poodle , lovely to listen to . His mouth and throat felt full , and he was giddy with the confusion of his own thoughts and the Chianti that he kept drinking . What did she want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to her voice now , not her words . The poodle that kept staring up at him with expectant black eyes made him think of what Lorna had said of people being made to conform . And suddenly the thought of taking Eloise to his apartment , of boxing her cared-for loveliness into that small atmosphere , obsessed him . He could n't even answer her when she asked him a question . " But , Carl , you have n't been listening ! " she protested . " I might as well have been talking to George . " He looked at her fixedly for a moment . " Will you go home with me ? " he asked . " To my apart-ment ? " She did n't urtlerstand him for a moment , and when she did her eyes opened even wider than usual . " Oh , no , Carl , I could n't do that . Oh , you poor boy , did you feel you had to ask me ? " " I suppose I 've shocked you , " he said angrily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me you 're disappointed in me . " To his further confusion she smiled . It was a nervous smile , but still , she smiled . " I do n't blame you in the least , " she explained hurriedly . " People can never believe that I mean what I say . But I do . You see , Carl , I 'm a perfectly ordinary wife and mother . I live in a busy , routine little New York world . It 's the way I am. "  |p93He  stared down at the table , resting his forehead in his hands . " I 'm sorry , Eloise . I do n't know where I 'm at . Why do n't you go on home now and let me just sit for a while ? I 'll call you again . And do n't worry . I 'll be good . " He did n't look up as she slipped away from the table , even when the poodle barked at him . BOBBIE CHAPIN 'S failure to live up to the dark picture of himself which Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberate . If women were important to him , his freedom was no less so , and he was not so unsubtle as to suppose that Hilda would take even the mildest advances lightly , particularly after her remark that choosing a husband was like choosing a career . That had certainly given him pause . It seemed a wanton risk in a city full of girls like Elaine , who enjoyed their liberty as much as he enjoyed his own , to play the reformable rake to an apparently humorless girl with auburn hair and serious eyes , just the kind of girl , as everyone said , that men like himself ended up by marrying . Oh , sure , he had heard it a million times , but what really worried him was a small , sneaking inclination on his own part to see this conventionaltableau as a romantic one , an inclination , as he knew perfectly well , that was based on nothing but thep94sloppiest kind of sentimentality . When Hilda , therefore , came into his office one morning to tell him , with uncharacteristictimidity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dinner and the theatre with them the following week , he thought it best to decline . " I 'm not much at those family affairs , Hilda , " he said with what he thought was his pleasantest smile . " Why do n't I pick you up after the show and take you out for a drink ? Would n't that be better ? " He could see immediately that it would n't be . Not a bit better . He was always surprised at how seriously his friends took their families . His own parents , who lived in Pittsburgh , were elderly now , and as his two brothers , both married , lived near them , very little was expected of him in the way of family duty . He called up his mother from time to time and sent them all expensive presents at Christmas . Occasionally in the summer he visited them for a week . But that was all . " Oh , please , Bobbie , " she urged . " I do want you to meet Daddy . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was really in earnest , and relented . " Okay , Hilda . Anything you say . I do n't have to put on a monkey suit , do I ? " " I 'm sorry . Daddy always wears a black tie to the theatre . " Holy smoke . He was really in for it . " You 're the boss , " he said . He regretted his decision more acutely on the night he was to meet the Dilworths as he stood before his mirror and tied and retied his black tie . In the next room , Larry Weavers , who shared the apartment , was giving a cocktailp95party that he wanted very much to join , a wish that seemed rather unreasonable in view of the somewhat superior attitudethat he had been recently taking towards Larry 's parties . Larry , who had been his classmate at Dartmouth and a fellow pilot in the Pacific , was his best friend , but he was beginning to wonder if Larry , at thirty-two , had not remained too resolutely faithful to what Elaine always referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , as it came down the corridor , brought irritating reflections as to the sober , stuffy evening that undoubtedly awaited him with Hilda 's parents . It even occurred to him to telephone her and suggest that she come over to his place instead . But no . As he again tied the wretched black piece of cloth around his neck he smiled rather unkindly at the thought of how such a proposal would shock her . She and her ideal husband . Oh , to hell with her , to hell with the whole thing , he thought disgustedly , as he buttoned the double-breasted coat of the closely fitted , midnight blue tuxedo that he almost never wore and went down the corridor to the living room . " Why Bobbie ! " " Talk about being all dressed up and no place to go ! " " Have a drink with us , Bobbie ? " " Or are you too good for us now ? " He waved an arm at them and went out the front door . Larry followed him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leo 's , " he said . " Why do n't you bring Hilda after you 've packed her folks off to bed ? " " I do n't think so , Larry . I do n't think it 's that kind of an evening . " " Can you spare me thirty then ? "  | " Jesus , Larry , again ? " " Make it twenty-five . " He felt even more deflated as he went down the stairs , having parted with five crisp bills from the check that he had only cashed at noon . Why , he fretted , did he always have to be the easy handout , the guy with clothes to borrow , a car , bighearted Bobbie ? What was the result of it but to have Larry spend his money while Hilda dragged him to some boring show ? Oh , Hilda was all right , sure , he liked being with Hilda , but alone with her , at a place like Leo 's where he could at least have a drink , not tied up in a theatre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , in from the suburbs on a three-day fling with a highbrow play every night and meals at some dark little tearoom ! He had to admit , however , that the restaurant where he was to meet them was more than a tearoom . As he followed the headwaiter to Mr. Dilworth 's table he took in the almost menacingly expensive atmosphere , the wide spaces between the tables , the green paneled walls , the big white menu cards crayoned in blue and red . Was this how a receptionist 's family lived ? Then he saw Hilda , looking tense , and in a moment he was being introduced to a blond , rather pale-faced lady about his own age and a forceful middle-aged man with thick black hair . " I 've taken the liberty of ordering for you , Chapin , " Mr. Dilworth said to him without even a suggestion of apology . " We do n't want to be late , you know . Hilda , what was that red wine we had here on your birthday , do you remember ? " While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to Bobbie.  | " Tell me , Mr. Chapin , " she asked brightly , " are you what George calls an uptown ' lawyer ? " So that 's who he was . George Dilworth . Hunt &; Livermore . And he , Bobbie , had been telling Hilda who was who in the legal profession . The little minx . " I suppose he thinks we 're all ambulance chasers , " he said , smiling a bit sullenly . " But are n't you ? It would be such fun to think of Hilda working for a firm of ambulance chasers . " " She 'd reform us all pretty quick , do n't you imagine ? " he asked , glancing at Hilda who was obviously listening to them as she pretended to study the wine list . " Which would be such a pity . " " You think ? " " Well , I 'm a great one for leaving things as they are , " Mrs. Dilworth explained . It was hard to tell from her alert , attentive manner when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and myself . " He was almost deciding that he liked Mrs. Dilworth when her husband , finished with the waiter , took a firm hold of the conversation . " I understand that you 're a partner of Alvin Herbert 's , Chapin . I do n't happen to know him myself , but I rememberhe represented a mortgagee in a bankruptcy proceeding in which I was referee a few years back . It was really quite an interesting thing , you see  --  " And he was off . It lasted during most of their rather hurried dinner while Hilda played disconsolately with her food and Mrs. Dilworth looked around the dining room , occasionally nodding , rather absently , to an acquaintance . The play , however , was worse . It was in modern blank verse , by an Englishman , and totally incomprehensible.  |p98Mr  . Dilworth closed his eyes and slept without even a pretense of listening , while Hilda , determined to give every playwright his fair chance , sat still and concentrated , shaking her head deprecatingly each time Bobbie tried to whisper to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying herself ; she laughed quite spontaneouslyat several points in the action . Mercifully , however , it was short , and when the lights went up at a quarter to eleven and people started reaching for their coats , he was overcome with the friendly feelings of relief . " Now it 's my turn , " he said cheerfully . " I want to take this party on to Leo 's . " Mr. Dilworth looked at his watch . " I insist , " Bobbie protested . " At least for a nightcap . " It was impossible to tell whether or not Hilda was pleased . She simply looked at her father to see what he would do . Mrs. Dilworth , somewhat to Bobbie 's surprise , made the decision . " Come along , George , " she said , slipping her arm under her husband 's . " We 'll go for just one drink and then leave Hilda and Mr. Chapin . You have n't taken me to a night club in ages . " Leo 's seemed very small and crowded when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger one where Larry Weavers , Elaine and the remnants of the cocktail party were rather boisterously enjoying themselves . They all stared at the Dilworths , but they were too well coached by Larry to do more than nod to Bobbie . The latter 's good humor , however , had been quite restored by the familiar atmosphere , and he was anxious now to show off his new girl friend and her family . " Mrs. Dilworth , " he said , leaning over to her . " I 'd likep99to have you meet my roommate . " This was followed by a general introduction and , becauseof the proximity of the tables , a merging , only partly intentional , of the two parties . Larry Weavers politely asked Mrs. Dilworth to dance , and she accepted , with her same pleasant , rather surprised smile . Elaine found herselfnext to Mr. Dilworth and began to talk to him , after darting a mischievous glance at Bobbie , in a manner very different from what Hilda 's father might have expected of a girl who was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see in Hilda 's troubled face that the move had been a mistake , but it angered him that she could leave nothing to his judgment . He felt a sudden rough urge to make her listen to him entirely , to blot out with the force of his own personality any lingering attention that she could give to Elaine and her father . " Let me ask you something , Hilda , " he said abruptly . " Very frankly . Do you mind ? " " Oh , no , Bobbie . Why should I ? " " Why do you work for that funny little firm of ours ? " " But do n't you think I ought ? " she asked , taken aback . " Do n't you think a girl ought to earn her own living ? " " Maybe . Sure . But when you 've got  --  " He made a vague gesture in her father 's direction . " I had no idea your folks were in that sort of league . I 'd always thought of girls whose fathers were partners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  well , as spending all their time in the Stork or places like that . Why do you want to pound that machine in our shop ? " " I suppose I should be sorry you do n't find me slinky , " she said in a small voice . He laughed.  | " Oh , you do n't need to slink , Hilda . You 're fine the way you are . For me , anyway . " Her hand was resting on the table ; she withdrew it quickly when he put his own on top of it . " Well , have it your way , " he said , frowning as she glanced covertly towards her father 's end of the table . " It takes all types to make a world . But do you really think your father 's going to kill me if he sees me touching your hand ? " She turned around quickly . " Oh , Bobbie , why do you say that ? " she protested . " You know it is n't done to hold hands in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smiled . " You mean to be honest , Hilda , " he said , shaking his head . " You really do . But you do n't succeed . You do n't even succeed in being honest with yourself . " " With myself ? " she repeated in alarm . " What do you mean by that , Bobbie ? " " You and me , for example , " he said , and then paused , wondering if he really wanted to get into it . " We 've been going about together . We 've been to parties together . Yet we could n't be more different , could we ? " He frowned again and shrugged his shoulders , suddenly irritated with himself as well as with her . " I guess we just like each other . " " But we 're friends , " she pointed out in dismay . " You said so yourself in the beginning . " " Yes , Hilda , " he said after a moment , giving it up , " I guess you 're right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just then they heard Elaine 's voice , sharp and clear , comingdown the table towards them . " Are you a divorce lawyer , too , Mr. Dilworth ? A mem/ber of what they call the keyhole bar ? " Hilda 's lip trembled . " Bobbie , " she said , " would you mind terribly if  --  " " I know , " he finished dryly . " You have a headache . " " Daddy can take me home , " she protested . " He 's readynow , anyway . " " I 'll take you home , " he said firmly . " No , please , Bobbie ! " She was alarmed again . " I want to go home with Daddy . Really I do ! " Ten minutes later , when , defeated , he had seen Hilda and her family off in a taxi , he returned rather moodily to Larry 's table and sat down by Elaine . " If you want to talk about Hilda , " she said sourly , " I 'll give you five minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilda 's face , that childish , prudish dismay . " I wish you 'd got off one of your real cracks , Elaine ! " he exclaimed and sat for a few moments staring into his glass . Then he looked up and saw her surprise . " Oh , hell . Forget it . I was thinking of this whole evening . What a goddam stuffy affair . Not for me , no , sir . Not for this kid . " " Not even Hilda for this kid ? " " Not even Hilda . She 's too good . She 's too damn good . " " Oh , is she ? And what about me ? Am I too good ? " " But you do n't have any pretensions about that sort of thing , do you , Elaine ? Seriously , that 's what I like about you . " Her expression showed how little she took this as a compliment . " I see it all , " she retorted . " You want me to persuadep102you you 're in love with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you to do that ? " " Because like all philanderers you 're afraid you 've never been in love , " she said sharply . " You want to rumple that blond hair of yours the way you 're doing now and kid yourself that youth and innocence have finally won their way into your rugged heart . Oh , I know you , Bobbie ! " " What brought this on ? " " But where you 've made your mistake , " she continued relentlessly , " is that this time there is n't any youth or innocence . That gal is hard as nails . " Well , maybe . He shrugged his shoulders . He certainly was n't going to discuss it with Elaine . He had other plans for Elaine . " And then there 's her family , " he said , as if he had been thinking aloud . " Why her father 's a goddam Wall Street lawyer . She 's been holding out on me . " " Oh , she has money . " Elaine nodded her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she seemed awfully confident about something . My congratulations . " " All right , Elaine , " he said shortly . " My five minutes are up . " In the taxi driving down Fifth Avenue to Fourth Street Eloise sat between Hilda and George . There had been a silence for several blocks , and she smiled in the dark at George 's obvious irritation at having to go so far out of his way . Hilda , after all , was his daughter , not hers . The balance that it was her role to strike between the girl 's filial adoration and his parental indifference made her feel useful but not responsible.  | " It was a nice evening , Eloise , " Hilda said finally , in a deliberate tone . " Thank you so much . And thank you , Daddy . " George grunted . This was followed by another silence . " I liked your Mr. Chapin , dear , " Eloise volunteered . " I was rather sorry we had to go to the theatre . I wanted to have more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's at-tractive . " " You do ? " " Yes . He 's gay . Full of fun . " " Oh . " Hilda sounded very dubious . " Did you like his friends , too ? " " Well , I really do n't know . Nobody did anything wrong , did they ? " " Oh , nothing wrong , Eloise , of course not , " Hilda retortedwith an impatience that showed the strain of the preceding hours . " It 's just rather humiliating to me that Bobbie ca n't face an evening with my family without surroundinghimself with his old drinking crowd . " George looked up at this . " It did n't seem to me that Chapin had much to drink , " he observed . " It seemed to me  --  " " Not tonight , no . " " Now wait a second , Hilda , until I 've finished , " he said testily . " You young people are always interrupting . All I want to say is that he struck me as a perfectly agreeable young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law he practises , but that 's neither here nor there . And what 's more , I understand from that girl he introduced me to that he has a damn good war record . " Hilda said nothing . It must have been hard , Eloise reflected , glancing at her , for girls her age , who had had nop104emotional commitment in the war , to have it always flung in their faces . It must have seemed as if the veterans strutted about , flaunting indulgences that were no longer for sale . " Are n't you being just a touch prudish , my dear ? " she asked her , as gently as she could . " Is it necessary to condemnevery young man who likes a drink ? " " A drink ! " Hilda looked at her almost pityingly and then abruptly changed her tone . " Anyway , it does n't matter , " she said flatly . " I really do n't care how much Bobbie drinks . Or who his friends are . " " Oh ? You 've had a quarrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the girl retorted . " You always have to dramatize everything . I simply mean that Bobbie and I are n't really interested in each other . Not that there 's any reason why we should be . But the fact remains we 're not . " Eloise smiled . " I do n't know if he sounded so uninterested when he talked about you tonight , " she said . Hilda snorted . " Bobbie gets around every woman he talks to , " she declared . " He 's always flirting . Even with you , Eloise . " " Even with me ! Well , thanks . Anyway , I 'm sure other girls find him attractive . I 'm sure Elaine Whatever-hername-isdoes . " " Oh , indeed ! " Hilda agreed , raising her hands in the air . " ' Well , you ca n't expect to have him to yourself right away , " her father cut in irritably . " What do you want ? No competition at all ? "  | " Daddy , " Hilda protested wearily , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Would it interest you to know what his relationship with Elaine is ? " Eloise and George exchanged glances . " I 'm sure I do n't want to know anything about Bobbie'sprivate life , " he said sternly . " And I often wonder , Hilda , if the girls of your generation do n't know more than is good for them . " " More than is good for us ! " she exclaimed indignantly . " Is that what it boils down to , all the teaching you and Grandma Dilworth gave me ? Is that the way I 'm supposedto face the major issues of life ? By turning my back on them ? " George threw his gloves roughly into the hat on his lap . " What brought all this on , for God 's sakes ? " he demandedangrily . " Ca n't a man make a simple remark withoutcausing a scene ? I guess I 'll never understand you , Hilda ! " Eloise put her arm around his stiffening daughter . " Come dear , let 's not go on with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all tired . " They drew up before Hilda 's apartment , and Eloise got out and walked to the front door to say good night to her . When she came back , a few minutes later , for she had been telling her not to mind George 's sharpness , she found that he had switched on the light in the back of the cab and was already deep in a printed galley that he had taken from his pocket . " What 's gotten into her , anyway ? " he muttered as she got in.  |p106His  irritation , she could see , had passed , but not because of any renascent sympathy for Hilda . He had given himself to a legal problem and to the pleasure of turning the wheels in his cerebrum and feeling their easy integration as the whole smooth assembly line moved towards its solution . Such were his moments of satisfaction . " She 's crazy about that boy , obviously , " she answered . " She thinks he does n't care about her because he took us to a place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wo n't see it for the compliment it is . " He shrugged his shoulders . " Well I ca n't worry about that , " he said as the cab started off . " She ought to be able to do a lot better than Chapin , anyhow . " " But if she loves him , George ? " " Oh , posh . Girls get over that . " How would he know , she reflected as they drove silentlyuptown . How would he know if he had never cared himself ? If he had never taken even two minutes to try to put himself in a woman 's shoes , her own or Hilda 's , even Irene 's ? For he was a man as other men , taking advantage of her weakness , not his strength ; she had helped to make him that way herself , through the years , she and Hilda , giving in to him . She shrugged her shoulders , suddenly tired , and closed her eyes , hoping that it was not pleasure that she felt at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not solve by her principles . For Hilda 's little principles , Dilworth principles , had rung out hollowly in their argument that night ; they had for once seemed childish , not menacing , pathetic instead of high-minded , and she could lean her head backp107and think of Carl and what he had said to her at the restaurant with something very different from her usual fear . SHE HAD MEANT IT when she had told Carl that she was not offended . She looked upon his proposition , on the contrary , as the greatest compliment that she had ever received . Indeed , the only reason that she had hurried away from the restaurant had been to be alone with the idea of it and hug it to herself . There was no disloyalty to George in this . It was not as if she had even contemplatedinfidelity . But from the beginning her inner life had been her own , her dreams and fantasies , and the outer code had no application to them , no relevance , for they had dreamlike and fantastical punishments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , she could enjoy the exultation , she could sit by herself in her bedroom , her hands grasping the arms of her chair , and listen to her heart pound as she re-created that scene . And it was better to be alone , anyway , for she had n't the least idea how to handle such scenes , how to reject without hurting feelings , how to show gratitude without encouragement , affection without commitment . Except was it even affection , she asked herself desperately , if there wasp108no commitment ? Maybe not , probably not , but whatever it was , the turmoil within , self-love or worse , it was her own . Carl telephoned her early the very next morning . " I 've thought it all over , " he told her , as she sat in bed frowning nervously at herself in the mirror across the room . " You told me the first time we met that you wished we could be friends . Do you still mean it ? " " Of course . " " Even after yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then we will be , " he said in his most serious voice . " And I understand now the sort of friendship you mean . " " Oh ? " " I do n't want you to think I 'm so wedded to the philosophy of muscle that I ca n't understand anything else . " " But I do n't , " she said vaguely . " Good then . We 'll be friends . " There was a long pause , awkward as only telephone pauses can be . " You make me feel as if we ought to sign something , " she said , laughing rather tensely . " Or as George would say , that we need a notary public . Why do n't you come in and see me this afternoon ? I 'm always home after five . " " I 'll be there , " he said , a little , she could n't help thinking , as if it were his first assignment . Peggy and Jo were with her when he arrived which she had planned , for although he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they lessened the constraint of the atmosphere . He told her about his rather lonely childhood in White Plains , about his highp109school years , about his career in New York University that had been interrupted by the war . She accepted his self-consciousness as she accepted her own and was encouraged , the next time he called , that he left with her the manuscript of a short story about a Central American revolution . It was not good , but when she ventured to criticizeit , even mildly , he was peeved . " You do n't want me to write about anything except what I 've actually experienced , " he told her . " You want to limit me to my home town and Iwo Jima . It 's a kind of snobbishness , like your crack the first day we met about the officers in my novel . No one can write about officers but officers . No one can understand Eloise Dilworth but a Dilworth . " " That 's foolish , Carl . You understand me . " " I do , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But that 's only because nothing has ever happened to me . " She sat back in her chair and gazed at the fire . " I believe there are lots of people like me , too . Exempt from crisis and catastrophe . It does n't always last , of course . I may blow up some day and turn into a subject for a Carl Landik novel . I almost should , should n't I ? You need a subject . " " There 's a limit to what I exact of people , " he said , mollified . " Besides , I 'd never use you , Eloise . You 're my friend . " " You will , dear , you will . " She nodded her head . " That 's the wonderful thing about artists . They use everything . And you 're quite welcome to me , Carl . Ca n't I deed my character to you , the way one leaves one 's body to a hospital ? "  |p110Sometimes  they met in the park in the afternoon and walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going home to tea with bouncing , emotional Peggy and Jo who had promptly developed crushes on Carl and crawled all over him , chattering about their school and which teachers and girls they liked and which ones they really , really hated . When they went off at last to their homework , after much lingering and stamping of feet , many giggles and blown kisses , he would talk , more easily than if the girls had not come in , about his difficulties at high school and in college and in the war , mostly the war . She loved to hear him describe himself and his friends in the Marine Corps ; she wanted to know everything about their reactions to friendship and discipline and battle . She could always identify the men in his novel from his descriptions of actual people . She knew it , indeed , almost by heart ; she had read it over twice more since their first meeting , and he told her that she gave him the feeling , rare enough to writers , of a communication almost complete . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . She had never before had a real friend of her own whom she did not have to share with anyone else and for whom she had no uncomfortable sense of responsibility . The sick at Bellevue to whom she read aloud , the veterans at Halloran with whom she played checkers , Aunt Gladys and George 's mother on whom she assiduously called and the wives of the Hunt &; Livermore partners with whom she dutifully lunched , all these were part of the world of her obligation . But Carl was her private corner , her recess , her underground in a world of action and assumed good feeling ; Carl was all that Irene had not been , and shep111could hardly believe in her own luck that this morose , tense young man , with his unhappy , hard eyes , should find her company worth his while . What could she possibly offer him ? Surely , it was only a matter of time before he would discover his error , before , careful as she was , she would tip her hand and show him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her spoil her pleasure in the very moments when he was with her , seeking to engrave them in her memory against the day when she would no longer have him . Yet she clung to him , despite her foreboding , as the one patch of green , of moisture , of shade , in the dry plateau that her life seemed to be becoming . Irene , it was true , who loved to gossip , telephoned her every morning and saved on her allowance by coming to lunch , but having regained her health and with it her independence of spirit , she had already assembled about herself a rather frayed and grimly sophisticated little group of ex-expatriates in whose gin-loving , blue-headed midst Eloise found little sympathy . She tried to be happy about her mother 's new vigor and life , but she had brought her home , after all , to be taken care of rather than to be entertained , and she felt at those spirited little parties in the two cluttered rooms at the Stafford something of what an old-maid nurse must feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she stands outside the patient 's room hearingthe gay chatter of the first recuperative cocktail party , the same patient , now calling so loudly for ice , who a few days before had been content to lie flat and listen to her stories of a simpler life . If she was disappointed , however , at the impersonalityp112of her relations with Irene , she did not equally regret the new distance between herself and George . For ever since she had acknowledged to herself her error in giving in to him about Irene at Storey Beach , the shadow of his disapprovalhad seemed less threatening . She had made up her mind , nervously and tentatively , but still with as much resolution as she could muster , that in a future crisis she would behave quite differently . George himself seemed partly aware of this change of attitude ; he could tell , she suspected , that the expression on her face as she listened to his evening summary of the day was more dispassionate , at times almost critical . He showed his bad conscience in his rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Her friendship with Carl , for example , had not elicited the least expression of disapproval . " Seems like a nice enough young fella , that , " he said after running into Carl one evening as the latter was leaving . " What 's he got , a crush on you or something ? " " Oh , no . Carl just wants someone to talk to . " " Well , if you have time for it , fine . Personally I should have thought you had too much to do being the good housewife you are , my dear , to have time for all the neuroticcomplaints of young writers . They are neurotic , are n't they ? Or am I unfair ? " " You just said yourself you thought he was nice , George , " she pointed out . " Well , he can be nice and still neurotic , ca n't he ? " " Carl Landik happens to be a very distinguished young man , " she said . " It 's not a question of whether I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round . It 's a treat for me , George . Ca n't you see that ? " He shrugged his shoulders.  | " Well , treat or no treat , my dear , it 's certainly up to you . The only thing I ca n't see is how , with all that 's going on in the world today , a young man can possibly be satisfied sitting at home writing novels . But I suppose it takes all kinds , as they say . " She said nothing to this . It annoyed her to think that he probably did n't even believe it himself , that it was something one said , one of those things that in his world went undisputed . If Carl , however , had so much to offer Eloise , it was equally true , no matter how little she knew it , that she had a great deal to offer him . Since his mother 's death when he was sixteen his relations with women had all been of a single kind . Now he had an older sister or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself defiantly , what nasty psychological term Lorna would have used  --  an approving , encouraging female friend whose sympathy seemed limitless . Sometimes he felt embarrassed at his own greediness for this sympathy , at the completeness of his surrender to her strange charm . At such moments his conditionseemed unmasculine , almost ridiculous , as if he were ignoring fundamentals in favor of teacups and roses , as if he were exalting chatter and degrading love . He would feel this most keenly when he had stayed longer than he intended and George Dilworth , home from the office , would walk in on them . For George seemed to accept him with the same easy good manners that he might have shown to a tutor for the girls . When he found him in the living room , getting up hastily to make his departure , he would put his hand firmly on Carl 's shoulder and force him back into his chair , telling him that he could not leavep114without a drink , that he , George , like Eloise , had too few opportunities of talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract with his publishers and pointed out a possible construction in Carl 's favor that his agent found very valuable . His attitude , generous and hospitable , was obviously that of a husband , completely confident , who was glad that his wife has found so inexpensive and innocuousa pastime . Carl , on the defensive after such encounters , would tend to be surly at his next meeting with Eloise . This happened one afternoon in the park where they met to discuss the outline of a new novel that he had given her to read . It was to deal with the State Departmentand the curious revelations of an ex-Communist who had also become a Catholic . The hero , of course , was unjustlysmeared by these revelations . " You do n't think it 's too topical ? " she suggested as they walked through the Mall between the double row of grey , weather-beaten statues . " Topical ? Of course , it 's topical , " he retorted . " I 'm not writing for posterity . I 'm writing for nineteen-forty-nine . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it never occur to you that readers may consider you a writer and not a journalist ? " " That 's specious , Eloise . We live in critical times . Peoplehave to take sides . They have to speak out . " " Individually . But as novelists ? " " Particularly as novelists . " " I do n't see why , " she protested . " People care about Carl Landik the writer . Nobody cares about Carl Landik the commentator . If they want advice on reform , it 's not to you they 'll come . "  |p115There  was something rather devastating in her simplicity . It may have been in her instinctive ability to separatethe vicariously from the immediately felt . It was as if she tapped his work with a small silver hammer , and he could hear for himself when it failed to ring true . " I suppose that 's what I should expect of you , " he said irritably . " Lorna was right when she said you read for escape . You 're a reactionary at heart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might even joggle your precious status quo ! " " Did Lorna say that ? That I read for escape ? " There was a faint flush on her cheeks , and he bit his tongue . " Not really , " he said quickly . " We were talking about readers in general . Hell , everyone reads for escape . " " Do n't be afraid to say it , Carl . I do n't mind . I was just startled for a minute , that 's all . But you 're wrong about the status quo , political or otherwise . I do n't care about it . One way or the other . Those things do n't really exist for me . " His irritation had disappeared in the embarrassment of his break . " What does exist for you , Eloise ? " he asked , almost politely . " The things I have to do . Or feel I should do . Little things . Daily things . " " Do n't you have a god ? I should have thought a personlike you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said after a moment 's reflection . " For other people , yes . I believe there 's a god for George and Hilda and Peggy and Jo . But not for me . " " Because you do n't deserve one ? " he asked with a smile.  | " Maybe . Maybe because I do n't need one . " He stopped and stared at her . " Because you do n't need one ? Eloise ! You mean that timidity of yours is really self-assurance in disguise ? " " It is n't self-assurance , it is n't that at all , " she said anxiously , shaking her head quickly and walking on as if she suddenly could n't bear to be still . " It 's nothing in the least praiseworthy , quite the contrary . It 's a kind of preoccupation , or obsession if you will . You see , if you do n't fit in , Carl , into your own world , that is , or think you do n't , which is the same thing , fitting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secret of the maladjusted . You do n't need faith of any kind , even faith in the world you 're trying to fit into . It 's like a picture puzzle , completely absorbing . " " But what is this , Eloise , about not fitting in ? You seemed perfectly at home at that party the other day  --  " " Do n't you think that 's enough about me ? " she interrupted , with a slightly tense smile . " Are n't we getting rather far afield from your novel ? " Which was all he had been able to get out of her , but had anyone else got more ? Lorna , for example , her closest friend , had never even suspected that she might be an interestingperson . " What you ca n't bear to admit , Lorna , " he had told her once , " is that you might have had a pearl all these years and never known it . Oh , I know how we feel about childhoodfriends , that it 's just a quirk in ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But most of us will admit it 's prejudice when we really consider it . That 's where you 're so stubborn , Lorna . You 'll never admit you 're wrong . "  |p117Lorna  had not known what to think . In fact , she had not known what to think of the whole relationship betweenCarl and Eloise . It seemed on the one hand almost incredible that they should actually be lovers , but on the other , and especially by the standards of her circle , it seemed equally incredible that they should n't . She became rather feverishly interested in the question and taxed Carl with it whenever she saw him . She hated to have people crawl out of the pigeonholes where she had placed them , and Eloise seemed unmistakably to be emerging from hers . Carl , however , much amused , took a lofty tone with her . " I would n't expect you to understand a friendship like mine and Eloise 's , " he said , in the last of their conversationson this topic . " You and Henry would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply unbelievable to you . It 's indecent . You 're actually shocked , Lorna , by my friendship with Eloise . " " What do you expect to get out of her , then ? Material for a new novel ? " She snorted . " Maybe you 're smart at that . They say Edith Wharton is coming back . " " Now you 're just being nasty ! " he said with a maddeningcalm . " I told you you would n't understand it . You ca n't . You feel we have to be earthy every minute . It 's really quite boring , Lorna . " " Well , if I were going to be a gigolo , Carl Landik , " she retorted angrily , " I 'd at least try to fulfill my side of the bargain ! " She was sorry that she had said this , but it was too late . He slammed out of the apartment , and her last source of information was closed.  |p118IRENE  WAS enjoying herself . It was her favorite time of the day , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge that the rest of the world was drinking too . On the coffee table before the sofa in her living room at the Stafford Hotel was a large glass shaker which she was gently stirring and beside it two glasses , one for herself and one for Arthur Irwin . The atmospherewas cozy , even intimate , for it was not the first time that the great banker had called . His card , in fact , had been left at the desk on the very day after she had met him at George and Eloise 's cocktail party where they had been so obviously and absurdly worried that she might shock him . She liked to imagine what George 's expressionwould be when he found out about these visits . The very prospect almost made up to her for the ridiculous rumpus he had made over her little toast at the dinner party at Storey Beach . It showed how little he knew of the smart world for all his nervous desire to get on in it . He could still come to Irene for lessons , poor battered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an apartment hotel without even a personal maid . Well , he would see . Even Eloise would see that her precious George did n't have all the answers plain brown business suit satp119on him without wrinkles . His thick wiry white hair seemed almost to blend with his forehead . He raised his glass slowly and deliberately to his lips and sipped with an unexpected smacking sound . Only a small tremble in the hand that held the glass showed his age . " It just goes to show how little I know the city I live in . I did n't even know they let you have your own furniture in hotels . " " There 's always a way with a price or a smile , " she said , rather sadly . " As I do n't have the price , I usually have to depend on the smile . " " You 're not going to get any sympathy out of me that way , " he said stoutly . " With that smile you 're better off than I am . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes around the room . " Yes , it is rather sweet . I ca n't bear not to be surrounded by my own things . " It was hardly necessary to tell him that the only things of her own were her portrait by Speicher , bobbed and cigarette-smoking , a relic of the early twenties , and the cluster of bibelots that adorned the tops of the several small Chinese lacquer tables : ivory elephants and knives , gold coins and snuffboxes , tiny jade figurines and porcelain shepherds and shepherdesses . Everything else , besides the two hoop-skirted floppy dolls on the sofa , had come from Eloise . But what of it ? It was her arrangement , not Eloise 's , that made the room . No one could have comparedit with that overdecorated living room of Eloise 's in New York , and as for the house in Storey Beach  --  " It 's so cozy here . " " It is cozy , " she agreed , as if she had been waiting forp120someone to supply her with just that word . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a comfortable home . Heaven knows , I ought to be able to . I 'm not exactly a novice . " She watched him as she made this flippant reference to her matrimonial past . There was a pause , a definite pause , but he finally smiled . Oh , she knew how far she could go with him ; she knew her tycoons . He would resent everything she had been born with and grown up with , as he resented it in Gladys and Gerald , but she had the advantage of having thrown it away . Alone and poor , dependent on a self-made son-in-law , she was a perfect illustrationof what he would consider the great moral of life : that acquisition was virtuous and disposition extravagant , except disposition by those who had acquired . She could look up , so to speak , from the mud into which she had tumbled and admire his passing show . " Yes , I suppose you 've had to do over a lot of those chateaux in Paris , or whatever you call them . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand . " He sipped his cocktail contentedly . " I guess that 's where Eloise gets it from , " he said . " I think she 's made George pretty comfortable , do n't you ? He 's a good boy , George . Not like some lawyers I could mention who spend their time sounding off with general statements and going to cocktail parties to meet new clients . " " Dear me , you are hard on Gerald , " she said with a disloyalsmile , but stopped when he frowned . Obviously , he did not like to have his points underlined by others . " Anyway , I agree about George . He has common sense.  |p121And  so few have that . " She knew she had to endorse his remarks about George . Arthur was almost paternal about George . " But dear Eloise , my angel , whom I adore , of course , I suppose she makes George comfortable enough , but the poor darling is simply devoid of taste . But devoid ! Maybe it comes from having too good a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit . " " I suppose it must , " he agreed , looking at the lacquer tables as though they too had come from France . She nodded . It did n't pay to be too humble . One could show pluck . Pluck , in fact , like acquisition , could be a virtue . " I saw Eloise this week , " he said . " Last Saturday afternoon in the park . I always walk around the reservoir , you know , on Saturdays . " " Did she go around with you ? She 's so healthy . " " No . As a matter of fact I did n't see her to speak to . She was with a young man who was n't wearing a hat . I think I saw him at that cocktail party where I met you . I noticed also that he had a yellow scarf on . Probably some sort of artist . Frankly , Irene , I was rather surprised . " She looked up . " Carl Landik ? " " And who , pray , is Carl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You great men do n't read , do you ? At least you do n't read war novels , the kind we have today . Full of big feeling and small words . " " Oh , he 's one of those , is he ? No , I certainly do n't have any time for them . I like books with facts in them . What does Eloise see in a boy like that ? " She shrugged her shoulders , raising her eyebrows slightlyp122at the same time . He looked shocked . " You do n't mean to imply you think there 's anything between them ? " " Why , Arthur , what do you take me for ? " she retorted immediately . " He 's a beau , that 's all . " He grunted . " What does she need a beau for ? " " Oh , Arthur . What does she need a beau for ? What would you need if you were a beautiful girl , married to a man who spends his days and nights working for Arthur Irwin ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard . It 's the way we get things done over here , Irene . " She looked into his cold green reproving eyes , at those set , thin lips that barely touched . It was odd at such momentshow , although not large , and although moderately round in figure , he could seem actually gaunt . The pink white flesh under the white hair dimmed almost to grey . " But you 're right , Arthur ! " she exclaimed hastily . " Of course you 're right ! It 's this terrible business ' you men have all the time here . It drains the energy . How have you managed to escape its consequences ? How have you held on to your looks and your hair and all those wonderful things ? " She laughed at his blush . " Maybe it 's getting to the top of the heap that saves a man . Is that it ? " They were back again on the safer topic of Arthur 's philosophy and of his rise to riches which led them in due course to the malfeasances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his opinion , had more money than was good for them . A widower , he watched , with a rather grim detachment , what he considered the inevitably corruptingp123process of money that had not been earned by its disbursers . This lasted them for two more cocktails and through most of dinner at the French restaurant where he took her later , but Irene , only half listening , hardly minded . She could nod sympathetically at the right intervalsand glance discreetly about the room with its red velvet curtains and red-shaded table lamps , rubbing her thumb and forefinger up and down the stem of her champagne glass , enjoying the warm afterglow of her martinis . There was plenty of time for her own thoughts and for a fuller consideration of the meeting in Central Park , of which her interpretation had been immediate and direct . Eloise , obviously , was having an affair . It explained everything , the presence of that boy at the cocktail party , his strange , cocksure attitude and Eloise 's subsequent evasiveness . Oh , it did n't seem like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point ; women like her , the least likely , were the kind to go furthest . And was it so terribly mischievous of herself , she reflected , assuming a pained expression as Arthur moved on to the story of his first and favorite child 's death , to exult a little that this should happen to George ? Driving home afterwards on the wide back seat of his town car , her legs warm and comfortable under the fur rug , she was surprised to hear him bring up again the one topic that was on her mind . " You know , it worries me about George and Eloise , " he said . " It 's the way those things start . Could n't you do something , Irene ? Could n't you persuade George to take Eloise off on a trip ? She would n't need this boy , I 'm sure , if George was around more . "  |p124Irene  smiled grimly to herself at the thought of George 's reaction to this . " Why would he want to listen to an old thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand which rested on the rug beside him . " Because you know more about the heart than all of us put together , Irene . And George knows that . Deep down . " She smiled again . Arthur would respect knowledge of anything if it was extensive enough , even knowledge of the heart . But she turned his idea over in her head that night and the following morning . What intrigued her about it was that it offered such a valid excuse to get into a situation that she was dying to get into . She knew that she would never get anything about Landik out of Eloise who had become increasingly evasive with her , despite their daily telephone calls , but to be able to go to George with sensible , homespun , painful advice , advice , too , that ought to be given , even if the bearer did derive a subsidiarysatisfaction from giving it , and to know , in addition to this , that she was giving it with the backing and at the instigation of his biggest client  --  well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ? Her opportunity came when she called at the Dilworths ' one evening that week , on her way out to dinner in their block , to find Eloise out and George in his dinnerjacket reading the evening paper in the living room . He looked up in surprise when she came in . It was not a pleased surprise . " Oh , hello , Irene . You 're not expecting to dine here , are you ? I 'm due at a firm dinner in twenty minutes . "  | " No , I 'm dining in the neighborhood . I thought I 'd just stop in . You do n't mind , I hope , George ? " " Mind . Of course , I do n't mind . Can I get you  --  can I get you a drink ? " She smiled thinly . " No thanks , George . I think I 'll just sit here for a bit . " She sat down , and for a moment they simply looked at each other . " Where 's Eloise ? " " Gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , that young friend of hers , Landik , went with her . " " Oh . " Irene paused significantly between her monosyllableand her next remark . " The young man at your cocktail party ? I did n't know he was a beau . " George lit a cigarette . Then looking up suddenly , he apologized and offered her one . She shook her head . " Landik 's not a beau , " he said in an unconcerned tone . " He 's more like a kid brother . You know Eloise . She always has to have a lame duck to look after . " " She does , yes . But that 's not going to keep the lame duck from thinking he 's a beau , is it ? " " You do n't get the picture , Irene . " He exhaled heavily and fixed his gray eyes on her . " He 's an artist . He 's probably got a couple of boy friends in the Village whom he 's much more interested in . " Irene laughed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've only met the young man once . But he did n't strike me as that type at all . Quite the reverse , I should say . " " Well , let 's hope so , " George conceded . " There are toop126many of the others around by a long shot . " Irene stared . She had not expected , even of him , a selfassuranceso sweeping . " Does it ever occur to you , George , that you may be taking Eloise a little too much for granted ? " He stiffened . " What do you mean ? " " You assume so completely that there 's no danger in leaving her to her own devices . Now , I 'm not saying there is . Perish the thought . But the assumption is not flattering , George . It makes life so drab . When , for example , did you last do something to surprise Eloise ? " " You 're the one who provides the surprises , Irene , " he said coolly . " I 'm a little too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should know . " She caught her breath at this . She was not accustomed to men who took the offensive so quickly . " I do n't mean in big things , George . I mean in little ones . Tonight , for example . Could n't you have passed up your dinner , just for once , and taken her to the theatre ? " He folded his paper and placed it beside him , giving it a sharp pat . " What is this ? " he demanded , looking up at her . " Adviceto the lovelorn ? Are you trying out a first installmenton me , Irene ? " " It might n't do you any harm to listen , " she retorted . " Marriages have been saved by cliches before . " He stood up , suddenly angry . " Do you think , Irene , that your own matrimonial recordentitles you to give advice ? " She got up herself , very pale now . His brutality hadp127filled her with a sudden sense of a world in which women no longer retained even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You certainly take a very high tone , George , " she said with what dignity she could muster , " to a person who 's only trying to help you . If I were your age with a beautifulwife admired by a much younger man , I might be many things , but I 'd never be complacent . " He snorted . " You think Eloise is tired of me . You 'd like to think that , would n't you , Irene ? You 've never thought I was good enough for your Riviera set . " " You 're being childish , George . I 'm only saying a very obvious thing , which is that when couples are of different ages , it 's only natural to expect that a time will come when they wo n't  --  well , how shall I put it ? When they wo n't want the same things at the same time , when one is less  --  well , shall we say less passionate ? " It was the look in his eyes that stopped her , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that his color was changing too , that red and purple were seeping into the blue of his closely shaven cheeks . It was the high flush of real anger , a massive , crushing , un-sex-differentiating anger . " So I 'm no good , is that it ? " he said in an ugly tone . " I 'm too old for it , is that what you think , Irene ? " Instinctively she moved a step toward the door . " I did n't say that , George . " " What did you mean then ? " " I simply meant that it 's foolish to assume that everything is all right . Even when it is. "  |p128For  another moment they stared at each other , and she could hear his heavy breathing . " Tell me about Landik , " he said , abruptly changing the subject . " What do you know about him ? " " Practically nothing . " " But enough to assume he 's her lover , is that it ? " " George , I never assume things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I most certainly do n't know that he and Eloise are lovers . " " What do other people think ? " " I doubt if people know anything about it . What is there to know ? " He got up and walked slowly over to the fireplace . He picked up the poker and began angrily rearranging the logs to break up the dying fire . " It 's time we both left , I guess , " he said shortly . " Has Eloise spoken to you about this ? " " Not a word . " " I suppose you 'd have to say that . " " I suppose I would . But she has n't . " She lingered there as he said nothing . " What are you going to do , George ? I hope not anything foolish . " " Foolish ? " He turned back to her from the fire . " I 'm just going to see that she sends this young whippersnapper packing , that 's all . " " You ca n't be so stupid ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've just been telling me that I take too much for granted . Well , I do n't intend to go on taking too much for granted . " " But do n't you know what that 'll do to her ? Do n't you know anything about women ? "  | " Do n't you know anything about decency ? " he almost shouted back at her . " Do n't you know anything about marriage vows and loyalty ? Of course you do n't ! You would n't believe in them if you did . This is all your fault , Irene . Eloise and I had no trouble before you came back . " " You mean no trouble that you knew of . " " I do not . I mean no trouble at all . " Irene looked at him in dismay , slowly shaking her head . " You 're a fool , George , " she said flatly , " and I suppose there 's no point arguing with fools . They 're always determined to be themselves . " WHEN GEORGE HAD CLOSED the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodding good night to the other , he returned to the living room and lit his pipe . He knew what anger did to him , and he wanted , if possible , to get it under control before he went to his dinner . As he sat before the fire he could feel it rising within him , then ebbing for a few moments , then rising again to the bursting point until his chest felt tight against his starched shirt and he could feel the sweat in his ears . He thought carefully about a piece of paper getting bigger and bigger until his mind was almost a blank , but at the last moment , as if someone had rudely ripped a cornerp130open , the whiteness was shattered by the image of Eloise and her mother sitting on the porch at Storey Beach gossipingabout him with sly giggles , comparing notes about husbands and how many times and when and how and who could and who could n't and was it true that Count So-and-So could still at the age of ninety ? While he had been imagining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . Catching up on that old slut ! As if her past was anything but a series of rumpled beds ! Oh , yes , he knew how Irene and her set talked . They made a lot of their culture and their wit and their general sophistication , but when you got right down to it , what was it but pornography , pure and simple ? Of course , he had never thought of Eloise as having anything truly in common with her mother , but they were both women , were n't they ? And did n't most women have the same attitude about sex , that they were entitled to it whenever and however they wanted , that the male who was n't always eager was always deficient , that all the remarkable things in the city , in the whole country , for that matter , with its industry and productionand law , were as nothing when placed in the balance with a little act that monkeys could do as well as men ? What did it matter to them that a man might break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become one of the best corporate lawyers in the city ? No , all they cared about was that and how much of it they got and when they got it . He had been a fool to think that Eloise was different , that because she was quiet she was undemanding . He had been an idiot to take it for granted that she appreciated that a busy man in his later forties , subject to the constant pressure of heavy responsibilities , wasp131apt to be less enthusiastic than a boy about  --  not , of course , that he could n't . Not that he had n't performed competently in his day and still would when he wanted , sharply and quickly , he liked to think , and not lingering over it in a dirty modern way . For what were people who made a fetish of it , who wrote poems about it , who called it the greatest thing in life but a bunch of decadents who were glad enough to shriek " impotent " at any man who put his life work ahead of the simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think when he had been in the mood , one night a week after he had packed her old bitch of a mother back to the city , she had said she had a headache . Well , she would see , she would be sorry , if she expected that she could make a fool of him , flauntingherself around town , wearing the clothes he had bought for her , the jewelry , in the company of some two-bit hack writer whom he would n't have employed as an office boy ! When he got to his club he found the other lawyers already seated about an oval table in a private dining room under a large dark portrait of General Grant . It was a dinner given for the litigation department of the office by Harry Hamilton , their senior trial lawyer , a semiannual forum where the different associates of the firm could learn about each other 's cases . George was not himself a trial lawyer , but as a partner and as a good friend of Harry 's he was always asked and always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderator of the evening , Harry enjoyed himself with a completeness that was rather terrible to behold . His personality entirely dominated his weight , making it seem firm instead of soft , imposing , even menacing , and the steady gaze of his large black eyes , thep132sweeping hook of his nose and the almost obscene baldnessof his great round head were Roman in their dignity . Even the implied buffoonery of his red velvet evening jacket and scarlet bow tie could do little to mitigate the commanding impression . A bachelor , Harry 's life turned emotionally around Hunt &; Livermore in whose sober and mild environment he could play without rival his chosen role of enfant terrible , the bane of the new clerks whose breaking in was his particular specialty . He would insult them flagrantly ; he would fling his hands in the air and thunder at their ignorance ; he would even threaten to fire them , and they frequently had to be caught emerging crestfallen from his office , their hopes dashed , their futures in pieces , and reassured that this was only " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , they were accepted altogether , and they could then join the little clique of admirers who aped his cynicism , his heavy humor , his extravagant passion for baseball , and who every evening at six were to be found ambling after him down the corridor on their way to dinner at the same waterfront restaurant . There Harry , released from the competition of his partners , of office routine , of home lives , would hold forth at his ease , over dry martinis and steak , about Lord Eldon and Joe DiMaggio , about perpetuities and shortstops , until it was time for the little group to amble back to the Wall Street office where the squares of light along the fifteenth story testified until midnight of their nocturnal industry . At the dinner it was his habit to call on people without warning to report on their cases , but even after they had risen to their feet it was Harry who held the center of thep133stage . Each speech had to be delivered against the runningflow of his comment . " I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawl , or , " Williston to the contrary , of course , " or , simply and abusively , " Crap . " When not interrupting he would look around the table with a rather bleary stare that seemed to protest , with a tired resignation , how hard it was that even paying what the firm paid and selecting only from the law-review boards of the country 's leading law schools , it still was n't possible to find young men who knew enough to state the facts , simply the facts , his upturnedeyes would seem suddenly to agonize , on which a court 's decision had been based . George that night did not listen to the speeches . He sat in grim silence , answering the associates who spoke to him in monosyllables . They soon left him alone . After the last talk , when Harry had glanced at his gold pocket watch , pushed back his chair and pronounced the meeting adjourned , the group rose and filed slowly into the bar for a final drink . George remained in his seat at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cups , puffing at his cigar . Harry , waiting for him , raised his eyebrows when he saw him still sitting there and ambledslowly down the side of the table . " Will you not repair with us to the adjoining chamber ? " he asked . " Will you not partake of the customary concludinglibation ? " " Let 's have it in here , Harry . I want to talk to you . " " Bill . " Harry had turned immediately to the last man in line who was filing out the door . " Bring Mr. Dilworth and myself double scotches , will you ? That 's a good boy . "  |p134Slowly  , solidly , he settled himself in a chair beside his friend . George , however , gave him no time to make himselfcomfortable . " Have you heard anything about Eloise and a young writer called Landik ? " he asked bluntly . Harry blinked at him solemnly for a moment and then took a long puff from his cigar . When he took it gingerly from his lips and deposited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was damp and black . He coughed . " I was wondering about that , " he said with a sigh . He pushed his glasses up over his eyes and rubbed his eyebrows with his thumb and forefinger . " I almost spoke to you about it after your cocktail party for Arthur . " George looked at him carefully . He knew that Harry could never bear to admit that he was hearing any piece of gossip for the first time . " What were they doing at the cocktail party ? " he demanded . " I did n't notice anything . Were they holding hands ? " He snorted , angry now at Harry for confirming his suspicions . " Were they necking in a corner ? " " No . " Harry shook his head solemnly . " Nothing of the sort . Do n't get upset , George . I notice things that other people would never dream of noticing . Perhaps it 's my own nasty mind . I simply noticed that Eloise seemed very cozy with a man considerably younger than herself who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all . " He shrugged his shoulders . " People have hanged for less . Innocent people , too . " George wondered resentfully if anyone but Harry would have made such a point of it . " Well , if you thought it was odd , I suppose other peoplep135did , too , " he said heavily . " I just had n't thought of it . I really do n't know anything about Landik . He 's been to the house several times , and Eloise has never made a secret of it . It never occurred to me that anything was wrong until  --  " His face darkened again as he thought of his mother-in-law . " What do you think I should do about it , Harry ? " Just then the young associate arrived with their drinks , which gave Harry time to prepare one of his speeches . " Eloise may be as pure as snow , " he said ponderously when they were alone again . " I 've no doubt she is . But you know my attitude about women , George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody to overhear . " If they did n't have what we were looking for just where we need it  --  " here he pointed significantly  --  " we 'd keep them tied up . " He nodded several times , his expression grave , as though to confirm the solidarity of men . " And I do n't admit to any exceptions . My wife , if I had one , or yours . " " Okay , Harry , okay . " It exasperated him that Harry should pick such an occasion to sound off with his oldest saw . But Harry took any reaction to his stories as complimentary . He nodded , as though George had given him the proper response , and placed his hand on his shoulder . " Will you leave it to me , George ? " " Leave what to you ? " " The whole thing . " Harry tightened his grip on his shoulder . " Harry the Snoop . He 'll find out for you . Leave it to the old litigator . And do n't worry . Eloise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unless what ? "  |p136Harry  shrugged his shoulders . " Unless she 's up to something that she should n't be up to . Do I make myself clear ? " There was a rather weighty pause , and then George nodded . He got up immediately afterwards and left the room without a word . Harry followed his friend into the little bar a moment later , a weary half-smile on his large pale face . He stood with his drink in one hand , the other on his watch chain , in the center of the little group of associates that immediatelyformed around him . He answered their questions with unusual mildness and even admitted that there were some decisions of the present supreme court that might be considered sound . He actually complimented one of the younger men on part of a brief that he had written and told several stories of the practice of law in New York when he had first been admitted to the bar which period , although little more than two decades back , he managed to invest with an almost Dickensian flavor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swaying slightly backwards and forwards in a rocking motion , he was filled with a tingle of pleasure that Eloise should at last be showing herself in what he was quick to deem her true colors . Poor George . Harry 's big eyes became limpid with sympathy . For once , anyway , the male was going to stand up and assert himself . There would be no driveling this time about " being a gentleman , " no graceful and cowardly giving in to the too often victorious female . It was still a man 's world if men would only realize it . And he would show them . He and George.  |p137ELOISE  AND CARL had been to a play about the cure of a woman alcoholic which Eloise had rather enjoyed . Carl had hated it , but his reactions , she reflected , were rarely moderate . " Sentiment , " he said disgustedly , in the taxicab afterwards , " gush . The hardboiled ' Broadway audience . That 's a laugh . " He snorted . " I 'll bet it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the movies . Jesus ! " He slapped his hand on his forehead . " At least the movies do n't always end on the note of life opening up again . Of rebloom . " " I like sentiment , " she said stubbornly . " And fundamentallyyou like it too . " " Is n't that just like a woman ? " he retorted . " Because you happen to like something , you assume anyone who says he does n't is a hypocrite . You wo n't even admit the possibility of higher standards in others . Why , I could write a better play than that with  --  " " Then why do n't you ? " " Ah . The feminine challenge . Well , maybe I will . I 'll bet it 's all poppycock that it 's so hard to write a play . It ca n't be more than a question of keeping people interested in what 's going on ' on the stage . Hell . That 's what every writer has to do . Fundamentally . " The taxi stopped before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink , Carl ? " " No thanks . I think I 'll take a walk . I want to get some of that hot air out of my lungs . " Upstairs , in the living room , she found George . He was sitting on the sofa with a brief on his knees . He glanced quickly at his watch as she came in . " Where have you been ? " " Where have I been ? " She looked at him in surprise . " Why , to the theatre with Carl , of course . Where did you think I 'd been ? " " I 'm sure I ca n't guess every place that young man chooses to take you . " " But I told you , George . Do n't you remember ? " When he said nothing she shrugged her shoulders and turned back towards the front hall . " I think I 'll look in on the girls . " He stood up . " I 've just been in . They 're sound asleep . Please sit down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is anything wrong ? " He stood in front of her now , his arms behind his back , his chin stuck forward . He was staring at the floor with a rather glassy concentration that struck her suddenly as pompous . " I want to know about you and Landik . " So there it was , she thought . It was quite wonderful that she should never have consciously predicted it and yet never have doubted that it would occur . And here I am , she thought blankly , sitting here , having it happen . " What is it that you want to know , George ? " " I want to know if I 've been a fool to have taken him as casually as I have . I 've trusted you , Eloise . I 've takenp139the whole thing at face value . " " And is there any reason you should n't have ? " " That 's what I want to know , " he said immediately , looking down at her . " I 've been told by two people tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure you , they did not mean it as a compliment . " She thought of where he had been , of his firm dinner . " Harry ? " " Never mind who , " he retorted . " It only matters whether or not there 's anything in what they said . " There was a long pause . " What do you think ? " she asked suddenly . The questionstartled her almost as it did him . " What do I think ? " he said angrily . " What do you think I 'm asking you for ? Do you think I do it to hear myselftalk ? " She stood up quickly at this . " George , if you think I 've been having an affair with Carl , I think you 'd better come right out and say so . " " Well , have you ? " She had not been prepared for such roughness . It threw her off balance and for a moment she could only stare at his angry , unfeeling eyes . " Have you ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said finally , almost as though it was an afterthought , " I have n't . " She turned and took a cigarette from a box on the table beside her . " You 're just good friends , is that it ? " he pursued . " That seems to be it . " " And he 's never suggested that you should be more than that ? " She lit her cigarette carefully.  | " I did n't say that , George . " He took a step towards her . " Why , the little ! " he exclaimed and then stopped . " And you go on seeing him after that ? " " I do . " " To encourage him to keep trying , I suppose . " She looked down , embarrassed . " You 're being very crude , George , " she said quietly . " You do n't give me credit for being able to handle either myself or him . When Carl and I first became friends he was a bit confused , that 's all . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's hardly fair to perpetuate his confusion , " he said sarcastically . " I 'm sure you wo n't think me unreasonableif I ask you not to see him again . " She stared . " You mean not at all ? " " I mean not at all . " " You mean I should just slam the door in his face ? " she exclaimed . " You need n't slam it . Only close it . He 'll understand . He must know there are people like me in the world , howevermuch he may deplore us . " She took a deep breath . " I do n't think I can allow my life to be run so arbitrarily , George , " she said with a firmness that surprised her . " I think I must be the best judge of what is and what is not wise in my friendships . " He closed his lips tightly and wiped them with his large silk handkerchief . " You mean you 're going to continue to see him ? " hep141demanded ominously . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after it has caused talk ? " " If I see fit . " " Even though I ask you not to ? " She nodded slowly . " Even so , George . " In the pause that followed this she felt a return of something like her old timidity , but it was not this time any fear , however nebulous , of what he might do to her , but rather of the position , humiliating as it suddenly struck her , into which she had put him . George was so accustomed to prevail when he was angry , and now he had n't . What could he do about it but glare at her ? " Very well , " he said in a dry , hostile tone . " I realize that the observance of marriage vows is going out of fashion . But I warn you , Eloise . Be discreet . I do n't relish the idea of being made a fool of . " Dumbly , she watched him go out of the room . Then she sat down to finish her cigarette . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her triumph before she went to his room to plead with him . " George , " she said , when she had opened his door and found him standing in his shirt sleeves before his bureau , " let 's not leave things like this . It 's so grim . " " I feel grim , " he said , without turning to her . " But is n't it all really too silly ? " she asked , looking helplesslyabout the room . It was neat and masculine , with two heavy mahogany bureaus with large brass handles on the drawers . It was hard and chaste and rejecting . Sometimesin the daytime , when he was downtown , she would stand in the middle of it , knowing that it bruised her , thatp142it would never compromise . " Nothing 's worse than this sort of fuss . I 'll see less of Carl if you want . I 'll be discreet . Oh , you ca n't imagine how discreet , George . " George turned and looked at her coldly . " That 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't want you to see Landik at all . I thought I made that quite clear . " She looked at him with a sudden mixture of awe and repulsion . " I guess you did at that , " she said . " I guess it was just that I could n't quite believe it . " And closing his door quietly behind her she slipped down the narrow corridor to her room . H ARRY HAMILTON had done everything to make his office in Hunt &; Livermore as different from the other partners ' as he possibly could . Not for him was the paneled sobriety of George Dilworth 's uncluttered room with its gleam of new furniture and huge crystal ash trays , the sanctuary of the corporate expert ; not for him , either , was the fussy elegance of Gerald Hunt 's great green chamber with its French armchairs and photographs of diplomats . Harry , indeed , had nothing but sneers for the whole redecorated office at 21 Wall Street , for the green oval reception room with its prints of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lampoons of English barristers , even for the neat still library with its glistening rows of reporters and Chinese rugs . He tried in his own office , the door of which was always closed to keep out the silvery sound of the endlessly repeated autocall , to strike the note of a less conforming era , to suggest an Ephraim Tutt without going so far as a roll-top desk , to act , in short , as an ineffective but vociferous protest against a uniformity that was devouring even the most individualisticof the professions . Harry had books and files everywhere , on his desk , on chairs , even on the floor , placed there and left there for months at a time , in a disorderthat only he could understand and that was never allowed to be interfered with by the despairing file clerks or librarian . He had a giant leather swivel chair , specially constructed for his large figure , a glass cabinet with his collection of Spanish cutlasses and on the wall behind him a rather sentimentalized battle painting from the Civil War in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geographically was just down the corridor from George 's , a proximity which Harry had insisted on in the recent relocation of rooms after the new decorating . His habit of ambling down the hall to call on George every day after lunch had become an indispensable part of his routine and one that even George , who disliked any social interruption in office hours , had long accepted . For George , however undemonstrative , knew how to assess devotion , and Harry had always been devoted . They had met in the beginning of their first year at Harvard Law at the same party at which George had met Hilda , his first wife , then a nursing student in Boston . When George had taken Hilda on to dinner afterwards , Harry , quite drunk ,  |p144had  insisted on accompanying them , but he had somehow succeeded in amusing rather than irritating them , and this triple date had been subsequently repeated until it had bloomed into a solid and enduring friendship . It was a friendship , however , that had been based in large part on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their recognition of this dependence in each other . Such a recognition might well have resulted in jealousy but for the gentleness of Hilda 's nature and her passionate fear of antagonizing . Sharing George with Harry , even after she had become Mrs. Dilworth , or perhaps , to put it more accurately , sharing with Harry the small part of George that she dared to call her own , had eased her feelings of guilt and enabled her to live out a continuing apology for her presumption in having accepted so superior a husband . Harry , for his part , had been almost servile in his respect for George 's single-mindedness . Speculative , disorganized , self-dramatizing , he had been fascinated by the contrast of George 's efficiency , his silences , his moods . Jointly and happily he and Hilda had ministered to this man who had taken them as completely for granted as they had fundamentally both wished to be taken , and this strongly knit and innocuous triangle had only been broken by Hilda 's tuberculosis and death . It had been said by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than George , and it was true . He had erected a stained-glass window in her memory beside his pew in the church that they all , had gone to together , and had prayed beneath it every Sunday morning afterwards , his eyelids tightly closed , his fat , white hands clasped in prayer , his head full of memories of a relationship that he knew too well could not be duplicated.  |p145There  had been compensations for Harry , however , in George 's widowerhood . Even Harry had known himself well enough to admit that . George , for example , had asked him to move into his house , ostensibly to keep him and little Hilda company , but actually , as Harry well knew , though without in the least resenting it , to take over the bothers of housekeeping which George detested . Harry had almost enjoyed the shared melancholy of that first winter after Hilda 's death . He had even allowed himself the desperate little hope that the arrangement might becomepermanent , that he and George might somehow continue their domestic as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevating but not necessarily despondent vigil before poor Hilda 's tomb . But he had reckoned , of course , without George . It had been obvious to everyone but Harry that George was planning to marry again at the earliest possible moment . He was not the kind of man who could remain single for long ; there were too many things , despite all Harry 's assistance , that could only be taken care of by a woman . He needed a mother for little Hilda , a hostess , a housekeeper , and after all he was a healthy man and only thirty-four years old . When George had been asked to bring his daughter down to spend his vacation with the Hunts at Storey Beach , Harry had thought it merely the kind of nice thing that Gerald would have done for any junior partner who had been so unfortunate as to lose his wife . Others , however , had thought of Gerald 's niece , so like poor Hilda , so sweet and thoughtful and anxious to help her aunt , but somehow , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the very pathos of her eagerness to be good and do what was right , so definitely on the family 's hands.  |p146Oh  , that summer ! Everything went back to that summer , Harry reflected with bitterness the morning after the firm dinner and his talk with George . He had not even been aware of the threat until he had gone down to spend a weekend with the Hunts and found George monopolized by that tall , blond , lanky girl who had followed him about everywhere and gazed at him across the table at meals with such offensively adoring eyes . He quivered even now with distaste at the memory . It might have been true that George had n't minded it , but it was equally true that he would n't have had a chance if he had . She had taken every advantage of his loneliness , thrusting herself into his path at each opportunity , rising early to have breakfast with him and in the end probably even climbing shamelessly into his bed . And what a catch for her , too , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , livingon the charity of an uncle ! He tingled again as he did each time he remembered that awful September day when George had told him , as casually as if he had been buying a new car or planning a fishing trip , that he and Eloise were to be married the following week . When he had spluttered about it being hasty , too ill-considered , George had simply smiled and told him with that disarming candorthat characterized their relationship : " I 'm not like you , Harry . I see no point in mourning . The dead are dead . If it 's all right to marry Eloise in a year it 's all right to marry her now . " Harry 's head had spun . It had been throat-filling , heart-compressing , excitingly horrible to think of Hilda dead only six months and Eloise already in her bed . Looking up sharply now and shaking his head to dismiss the thought of it , he picked up his telephone and told hisp147secretary to send in Tom Haighter . Tom was an affable young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nephew of one of Harry 's partners and exuberantlyanxious to show everyone that he expected no favors . He was not yet a member of the Hamilton inner circle , but Harry had an eye on him , still not sure that he would n't turn out to be too tweedy , too social for the disciplineand dedication of the litigation group . " Tom , " he said in a hearty voice when the young man came in , " how would you like to be my lawyer ? " " Your lawyer , Mr. Hamilton ? " " I have a matter of some delicacy that calls for the services of just such a man of the world as I take you to be . " Tom looked pleased , but suspicious . Oh , they knew him all right , these young men , Harry reflected comfortably . They knew how much faith to place in these compliments . " What 's it about , sir ? " " Well , it 's not strictly speaking a legal problem , " Harry continued , carefully inserting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It involves getting in touch with that detectivewhom we use in personal matters  --  Fitzgerald . I want you to arrange to have a certain person watched . " " What person , Mr. Hamilton ? " Harry smiled at the eagerness of his tone . There was no necessity , he knew perfectly well , of bringing Haighter into this ; he could have more easily talked to the detective himself . But to have had no one to whom he could denouncethe iniquities of Eloise 's conduct would have been to forego the greater part of his pleasure in knowing them . Now , moistening his lips , he prepared his stroke.  | " Mrs. George Dilworth . " " Mrs. Dilworth ! " Tom exclaimed . " What has she done ? " " You see why the matter is confidential , " Harry continuedbriskly , underplaying the drama of his news . " It 's a question of whether or not she is having an affair with a young writer called Carl Landik . " Tom seemed upset . " Does Mr. Dilworth know this ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing , I mean ? " Harry looked up in astonishment . It was distinctly not the tone of a Hunt &; Livermore associate . He moved quickly to quash the impertinence . " George know ? " he demanded with an air of incredulity . " Why of course George does n't know ! I make it a habit , " he continued sarcastically , " of taking it upon myself to check on the fidelity of my partners ' wives . You might say it was my hobby . " Tom flushed and looked down at the floor . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Hamilton . " " George has done me the honor , " Harry went on in a drier tone , ignoring the apology , " of confiding in me , as I am now confiding in you . He suspects that his wife shows every sign of being less exclusive in her devotions than he could wish . " " But do you agree with him , sir ? " Harry stared at this second impertinence . " You 'll learn in life , Haighter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two kinds of rumor that are always true . One is that people are dead . The other is that they 're committing adultery . "  |p149He  had to admit , however , that Tom did not seem impressed . The boy had probably met Eloise at one of those annual firm cocktail parties while she was skulking around the edges in that way of hers , pretending to be shy and democratic and anxious to talk to the clerks when she was actually only interested in the proximity of young men . Oh , sure , like better men before him , Tom would have been taken in by the dishonest humility of those eyes . " I do n't think it 's right to spy on a woman , " Tom protested . " Particularly a woman like Mrs. Dilworth . I 'll bet you anything Mr. Dilworth is wrong about her ! " There followed a pause in which he perhaps reflected that he had gone too far . He smiled a rather tense smile to show that he was still on Harry 's side . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued in a halfhearted effortat banter , " that you may be letting your well-known misogynism affect your judgment ? " To have his moral anger taken as the expression of a personal animosity based on his own lack of something which this healthy young animal seemed so struttingly to represent was to have his little scene devolve very differentlyfrom the way Harry had planned it . " I am not letting anything affect my judgment ! " he roared , sitting up straight and using the voice that he usually kept for recalcitrant witnesses . " I am simply endeavoringto help an unhappy friend who is in the grip of the most wretched suspicion that a man can suffer from ! If Mrs. Dilworth is as innocent as you surmise and as I sincerely hope , my investigation will at least have borne the happy fruit of restoring his faith in her . " He paused here and glared at Tom.  | " I guess that 's so , " the latter said , abashed . " I had n't thought of it that way , sir . " Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find helping me in this matter distasteful , " he continued , shifting to a softer , more menacing tone , " I have no wish to have you act against your conscience . I am reasonably sure there are others in the departmentwho will listen to my cry of need . " Tom 's ambition , which had been dozing , reawoke with a start . " Oh , no , sir , I 'll be glad to help . " " You 're quite sure now ? " " Quite sure , sir . " Harry eyed him speculatively for a moment . " Have Fitzgerald in my office this afternoon at three , " he said abruptly . " Thank you , Haighter . " He glowered at the young man 's tweeded back as he left the office . It was unfortunate that he had not picked one of the older associates . Haighter 's spontaneous crudenesshad almost spoiled his morning . ELOISE WAS RELIEVED when she woke up the next morning to remember that George was leaving for Chicago for a week on business . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she heard his voice in the passageway speaking to the girls , and she sat quietly in bed , holding the edge of the spread tightly in her fists until the voice and his heavy tread had passed by outside her room and she heard the front door slam . Then she breathed again , but her relief was a blank , empty relief . " Hi , Mummy ! Daddy 's going to Chicago . Why does he have to go to Chicago ? " Peggy and Jo burst into her room , dressed in their green school uniforms . " He has to go on business , dear . He has to make money . " " Is that what they do in Chicago ? " " I guess it must be . " " Will Carl come today , Mummy ? " " Yes , will he , Mummy ? " Jo reiterated . " I have a pocket comb in a tortoise shell case to show him . I got it at a trade in school for the doll with the bust eyes . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to throw it away . " " That 's why I traded it . " " Is n't she terrible , Mummy ? " Peggy protested . " All the girls say she 's a cheat ! " " They do not ! " " But would you like it if they did , Jo ? " Eloise asked reprovingly . " That 's the point . " " Will you read to us this afternoon , Mummy ? " Jo demanded . " Will you read The Scottish Chiefs ? " " Yes , will you Mummy ? " " All right . I promise . " When they left she lay back in bed with a curious numb/ness . She felt as if something had given way within her , with a gentle but nonetheless distinguishable snap ; she did n't know what it was , or just how vital , but she had a sense of floating precariously in a sort of undulating void , being slowly propelled in a direction in which she was not sure that she wanted to go . It was as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a marionette in the exact performance of assumed and imagined tasks had parted . The telephone rang ; it was Irene . " I was waiting for your morning call , darling , " she began . " Is anything wrong ? " " What do you think might be ? " " Oh , nothing . " Her mother 's voice sounded surprised . " Is George all right ? " " He 's gone to Chicago . " She was suddenly quite certain that Irene was one of the two people who had spoken to George the night before . " Then we 'll be able to spend an evening together , " Irene continued . " Shall we set a date ? Tonight ? Tomorrow ? " Eloise raised her eyebrows at her own reflection in the mirror across from her bed . " I 'll have to call you , Irene . I 'll have to see what I 've got on this week . " " Oh . " Her mother sounded hurt . " Well , that 's fine , child . You call me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room she was surprised to find Hilda turning the pages of the morning paper in a desultory fashion . She looked up as Eloise came in . " Oh , hello , " she said . " I came to see Daddy before he went to the office . But I see he 's gone . "  | " Yes . He 's gone . " " Can I come around for supper tonight ? I want to talk to him . " " You can come for supper , of course . But I 'm afraid you wo n't find George . He 's gone to Chicago . " " Oh . " Hilda looked utterly discouraged . " I did n't know . He never told me . " Eloise sat down opposite her . " I do n't suppose I could help , could I ? " Hilda looked at her doubtfully . " I 've quit my job . " " You have , really ? I 'm sorry . That is , if I should be sorry . There was n't any trouble , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bobbie . I did n't think I should go on seeing him . " Eloise sighed . " And I thought he was so nice . Well , I suppose there 's no help for it , " she added , shrugging her shoulders . " Would you like to take a trip ? I believe that 's what peopledo under the circumstances . George is away , but I 'd be glad to give you the money . " " Oh , no thanks . " Hilda seemed flustered by the ease with which Eloise took it . " I 'll get over it . It wo n't kill me , after all . And it must be better to go through this now than get involved with someone you ca n't really respect . " She paused and then appealed to Eloise , suddenly , almost belligerently . " Do n't you agree , Eloise ? Really ? " " I do n't know , dear . I really do n't . " " Oh , Eloise , why do you always say things like that ? " Hilda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at parties and loose as  --  as I do n't know what ? I supposep154you would n't know , " she continued bitterly . " You fell in love with Daddy . A man who had everything . You probably ca n't conceive what it 's like to find yourself caring for someone like Bobbie . " " I could imagine it , could n't I ? " Eloise speculated , watching her and smiling . " I should think I could imagine it just by seeing how down you look . If life is like this without Bobbie , I ca n't help wondering , dear , could it be so much worse with him ? " " I have to do what I think is right , " Hilda said impatiently , turning away from her . " If you do n't see it that way , I do n't see how I can explain it to you . " Eloise studied her for another moment . She had the same detached feeling as when she had been talking to her mother . " I know you 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but stopped immediately when she saw the girl 's expression of horror . " No , I should n't say that . It 's childish to say that . Let me put it this way . I know you 've never felt that I 've been any help to you , and maybe I have n't . I do n't apologize , because I do n't think it was altogether my fault . It 's not easy to be a stepmother , particularly when you had to start as young as I did . But I still think you 're making a mistake to be as hard on Bobbie as you 've been on me . And on yourself . Of course , it 's your life and you must lead it , and nobody knows that better than you , dear . But I feel sorry for you , Hilda , and I do n't say that with any sense of superiority . " Hilda was speechless for several moments , staring at her . Then her fortitude suddenly collapsed . " Oh , Eloise , " she cried , getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like you ! Please do n't ! It 's not true . " She leaned over and kissed her with tears in her eyes . " I 've been jealous of you , I know , and there have been times that I 've thought unkind things about you , but it is n't that I have n't liked you . It 's just the opposite , really . " She sat down by her , suddenly quite humble . " Do you really think I 'm being stiff and prudish ? " " Well perhaps just a bit , dear . Do n't you think so yourself ? Just a bit ? " " Maybe . " Hilda nodded morosely in a mood of **26;6908;TOOLONG . " Maybe I am a prude . Maybe that 's what I deserve to be , a prudish , censorious old maid . " " Dear me . " " But it 's true , " the girl exclaimed excitedly . " You know it 's true ! " " Hilda , " Eloise said firmly , putting her hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner here one night while your father 's away ? Just the three of us ? " Hilda shook her head gloomily . " He 's in Florida . On one of those divorce cases of his . " " Then he does n't know you 've quit your job ? " " No . " " Well , that 's good , " Eloise said hopefully . " I was afraid you 'd had a scene with him . Now he wo n't have to know why you quit . " But Hilda shook her head again . " Yes he will . " " How ? " " Oh , he just will . " Hilda sighed . " He 'll ask me , and I 'll have to tell him . " " Oh , Hilda . " Eloise raised her eyes to the ceiling . " Stopp156being a Dilworth , for pity 's sake . For once in your life . " When she finally sent Hilda back to her apartment , the girl seemed moderately cheered up . She had promised to write Bobbie a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business course , and she was planning to absolve her conscience by actually enrolling in one . Eloise , alone at last , went out for a walk in the park . She was surprised at her own serenity . She had defied George , after all , even if nothing had happened . Well , what had she expected would happen ? What had she thought he could do to her ? Beat her ? Strip her and exposeher to a mob of jeering men as in her fantasies she saw herself , the agent of Irene 's world punished by the stern people of his ? No , after all , thank God , she was still rational ; one could fear the anger of a man like George , fear it neurotically , but when it came it had to be an anticlimax . There was nothing else , by simple definition , that it could be . As she walked along she thought less guiltily of Carl and of how clear and young the skin on his cheeks was beneath the older look in his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working at his desk , staring out the window , concentrating , not thinking of her . She did n't really want him to be thinking of her . She wanted to think of herself as accessory , as only there to console and relax him when he was tired or could n't write . And a sudden excitement took hold of her when she thought what other people might be saying about them , not only Irene and Harry Hamilton , but others , lots of others  --  a squirrel crossed the path in front of her in two quick bounds , and she stopped , her heart beating as if she had heard a sudden sound in the night.  |p157When  she got home she found that Carl had telephoned . She called him back , and he asked if he could come to tea . " I 'm afraid not , " she lied with a glibness that surprised her . " George 's mother has come down from New Hampshire , and I expect to be tied up for the next few days . You know how eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Empire State , Grant 's Tomb . I 'll call you when I 'm free . " He grumbled , but he believed her . She could tell that , and she was proud of herself , as she had been proud when she had put Irene off . She read an hour to the girls that night and sent them to bed to talk about William Wallace while she went alone to the movies . The next day and the one after that she kept to herself , putting her mother off in the morning call , telephoning Hilda but not seeing her , canceling her luncheonengagements , even failing to turn up at the board meeting of her club for neighborhood children . She walked in the park and went to the movies and felt bored but clear-minded , restless but free . She was even beginning to wonder if she might not be readier to give up Carl than she thought , if she had not at this point given him all the sympathy he needed , indeed all that she could really give . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was rather ridiculous for her to be seen about town accompanied by someone as young as Carl , someone who ought to be seeing girls his own age or even thinking of marriage . She wanted him to marry , of course . But she was quite sure of one thing . She was not going to give Carl up because George had snapped his fingers , even if George should think , when it happened , that this had beenp158her reason . She would give him up perhaps , but not until she had signified in some way to herself that she knew what she was doing , that she was not being coerced , that it was the free act of a woman who realized that the whole relation was by its nature temporary , that there could be no real future for that kind of friendship between a woman like herself and a young man like him . " You 're so hard to get hold of these days , " Irene told her the third morning on the telephone . " Anyone would think you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they please , " she said rather grimly . " I 'm sick of anyone . " " I hope you 're being discreet , " Irene continued , more sharply . " You do n't think you could use the advice of your old mother ? She knows her world , you know . " " Oh , Irene , you can have your world , " she said wearily . " Are you so sure that you understand other people 's ? " " All right , dear , all right . I was only trying to help . " This interchange , unpleasant as it was , had made her face up to the fact that it was exactly an affair that she was contemplating . It was small wonder that she had been avoiding people , that familiar faces had filled her with suddenpanic , now that she realized that what had formerly been a guilty , secret thought might unbelievably become a fact , now that she could picture the stiffening of friends ' cheeks , the narrowing of their lips at her playing publicly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always reserved for her fantasies . While she kept away from people she could be alone in the privacy of her imagination ; what she was thinking seemed more logical , less terrible . Did n't they do it , too , other people , even , perhaps , the people she feared ,  |p159was  n't it recorded in all the novels and plays that she read ? Was n't it love which , everyone seemed to agree , gave life its enduring significance ? If she could go to Carl once , just once , she reasoned desperately , she might be able to return in peace to her role of wife and mother for as long as need be , but to give him up and go back to her old life without ever knowing , as she was sure now that she had never known , the embrace of a man who really wanted her , particularlynow , when she felt at the crossroads of life , with the possibility of courage actually and for the first time ahead of her , would be to achieve the bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgracing passion . She thought of it as she lingered alone over her solitaryteacup until the girls came bounding into the room , and she blushed and expiated by reading The Scottish Chiefs until her voice was tired , way past their bedtime . " Carl , " she heard herself say late one afternoon when she had called him , dialing the number with a trembling hand , " I 'm off duty . The dear old lady 's gone home . How about a cocktail ? " " I was just thinking of a cocktail . I 'll be up in a half-hour . " " No , Carl . " She paused to swallow . " You know , I 've never seen your apartment . Could I come down ? It 's so bleak up here . The girls have gone to a birthday party , and George is away . " " Come along . Would you like me to get Lorna and Henry over ? " " Oh , no . " She paused , having said it too quickly . " Let 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , I 've done it , she thought . I 've really done it . But do n't even think about it , Eloise , she whispered to herself , get in a taxi and go , just go , for God 's sake ! All the way down in the cab she kept repeating over and over the burning lines of Phedre 's declaration to Hippolyte . She wondered if his smile was suggestive when he opened the door ; she could n't be sure . She stepped quickly past him into the small living room and sat on the stool before the fire which he had lit . She heard him mixing the cocktails behind her , but she did n't turn around until he came over and put one in her hand . Then she took in the room with its cracked ceiling and dark green walls , its batteredfurniture and the plain board bookcase stuffed with books , new books still in covers , old school textbooks , theatre programs . Several paintings by friends , unframed , nudes and landscapes , hung on the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you poor dear , " she said looking down at the bare floor . " I keep meaning to get one . But you know . I never get around to it . " " Let me give you one . Please . " He sat down in the armchair near her stool and poured himself a drink from the shaker . " Sure . I 'd like a rug . " " As a matter of fact , " she said , looking around , " I could do a lot for this apartment . " " No , just the rug , thank you . Why is it that women always want to change things ? I 'm quite happy the way this is . " " Well , then this is the way it should be , " she conceded . She drank her cocktail quickly . " Did you give your mother-in-law a good time ? "  | " Oh , she did n't come , " she said almost casually , turning again to look into the fire . " That was just a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days . " " Eloise ! " he exclaimed , laughing . " You do n't have to tell me stories . Just say you do n't want to see me . I 'll un-derstand . " There was a silence . " What did you want to be alone for ? " he pursued . " To think . " " About what ? " " Myself . What do we ever think about ? " " I 'm learning more and more about you . I had always thought of you as practically without an ego . " He poured her another cocktail , and they discussed the ego in a desultory way , he doing most of the talking . It was like their first lunch together , she reflected , when she had done the talking because he had had something else on his mind . Now their roles were reversed . As she stared at the two flaming logs she had a dreary , dull feeling that the moment had passed and that she would never dare make her proposal now , that she would simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk and then go home alone in a taxi to the endless unfolding of her own life . It would happen that way because it had always happened that way , or rather had not happened . She was destinednever to participate , never to do anything but lend a nervous cheerfulness to the lives of people who not only disliked cheerfulness but distrusted it . She could go back to The Scottish Chiefs and to children who were less interested in it than she was herself . She took a long swallow of her drink and turned to him desperately . " Carl . "  | " Yes ? " His dark eyes looked worried ; when he rubbed his cheek with his hand he seemed almost too boyish . " Carl , do you remember what you suggested the day we had lunch together in that Italian restaurant ? " He flushed . " Of course . " " I wish you 'd suggest it again . " She saw how she had startled him and turned miserably back to the fire . He was repelled , of course , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm sorry , " she said and closed her eyes . " I should know there 's a time and place for everything . I had my chance and missed it . I should have let well enough alone . " She shook her head . " You 'll have to forgive me , Carl . I 'm new at these things . " " Eloise . Poor Eloise . " She felt his hand on the back of her head ; he was turning her around ; he was kneeling down beside her stool , but still she would n't open her eyes . He kissed her on the lips , and it was the firm kiss of deliberation . He was beingkind to her ; he was probably shocked at what must have seemed to him an almost incestuous idea , but she no longer minded . His lips were as warm as the fire she had been staring into , and she clung to him greedily , not caringnow what he thought of her or even what she herself thought of anything . When he released her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said nothing at all , and she watched him lean down and remove his shoes . He looked matter-of-fact , almost indifferent . Then he looked at her and smiled and , overcome with embarrassment , she got upp163and hurried into the next room , almost dark in the twilight , and cold . She took off her clothes quickly , almost frantically , and stood by the bed shivering , running her hands up and down her arms and her sides . In a moment he was beside her , and she lay down , suddenly oblivious of the cold , with a shudder at the feeling of the sheet against her back and shoulders . This is it , this is everything and everybody , this is what I wanted ; this is what I planned , this is me , she kept thinkingdesperately , until she almost ceased to think , until she seemed to become a blend of all her guilt and excitement , until she thought she heard a sound , and then again , and it was nearer , and then  --  The light on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The room seemed suddenly to be full of people , and a flat male voice was saying : " Sorry , folks . Do n't let us disturb you . Just getting a snapshot for the lady 's husband . " When Carl got up she had a glimpse of his bloodshot eyes . He swung at one of the four men in the room , the one with the camera , but two others grabbed him and held him there , naked , while the camera man photographed him . She sat up and reached wildly for the blanket ; she pulled it over her and threw herself back , turning over and burying her head in the pillow , deeper and deeper with a writhing motion . But there was to be no unconsciousness of this , deliberate or otherwise . Her nightmare had at last come true.  |p167THE  HERBERTS ' apartment was grey and modern and dominated by a single , large abstract painting hung over a fireless hearth concealed by a fire screen . Hilda Dilworth , knowing nobody at the party , stood at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and tried to look as if she were listening to the man who was telling her how sick he was of hearing about Albert Schweitzer . But Hilda was too preoccupied even to disapprove , as she normally and vociferously would have . She only wanted to be unnoticed or at least unspoken to ; she felt as lifeless as the grey cushion on the L-shaped divan or the green ash tray with the cartoon stenciled on its surface . What was she doing there ? she kept asking herself . But what , for that matter , would she have been doing anywhere else ? Mr. Herbert , fat and offensively merry , was wearing a paper cardinal 's hat and mixing cocktails in an enormous shaker . " You do n't know how much we miss you at the office , Hilda , " he said as he came by with the shaker . " Already . We 're hoping you 'll come back to us . Keep it in mind , will you ? " He glanced disapprovingly at her untouched cocktail . " How are you doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , I 'm doing fine , thank you , Mr. Herbert . "  | " You 're the mousy type , are n't you ? " he continued with a wink . " Do you know that all the time you were with us I never knew you were George Dilworth 's daughter ? Not until last week when you quit and Miss Ranick told me . I do n't happen to have the pleasure of knowing your father personally , but I know several of his partners . Harry Hamilton , for example . And , of course , we all know Gerald Hunt by reputation . Mr. Hunt is your uncle , is n't he ? " Hilda stiffened . " No . " " Really ? I thought he and your father were related . " " He 's my stepmother 's uncle . That 's what you may have been thinking of . " " I see , I see . " He nodded , confused at her coldness . " Well , anyone you want to meet , do n't be shy . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pal of yours , is n't he ? He 'll be along in a minute . Just back from Florida and brown as a berry . Tried to tell me he 'd been working down there , but the old boss knows better . Still , he 's a good boy , do n't you agree ? " " I 'm sure he must be . " He glanced at her uncertainly . " Well , as I say , he 'll be along any minute , " he said , obviouslyanxious to carry his shaker to more cheerful parts of the room . " I did n't tell him you were coming . It 'll be my little surprise . " He moved on , and Hilda turned back to the man who was still talking about Schweitzer , trying to forget how intenselyshe had looked forward to this party and how little she was enjoying it now . When Mrs. Herbert had tele/phoned her only three days before she had accepted without even hesitating , though she had known perfectly well that they were only asking her because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't cared ; that was the point . For the first time in her life she had n't cared what motive anyone had for anything . The mere possibility of seeing Bobbie had made her shiver as if an impudent hand had slipped suddenly around her waist . Eloise had almost convinced her that such shivering did not have to be a crime . That , however , was then , before her life had been splinteredby her father 's call . Come home , Hilda . Please come home right away . Peremptory , demanding , even pitiful . And she had gone to find him in a terrifying , a desperate rage , Eloise evicted , the little girls awed but curious . This is you , Hilda , she had told herself , this is your moment , your chance to take the powder to the fort in your apron , to tell cheering stories to the faint of heart in the lifeboat . Once to every man and nation . She had gone to her old room , now hers again , after that first talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rug and clenched her fists to make herself realize that it had actually happened . Oh , yes , it was her world , after all . Not Eloise 's , not Eloise 's kind of world . She had not prepared herself in vain . " Let me get you another drink , Miss Dilworth . Is there anyone else here you 'd like to meet ? " It was Mrs. Herbert this time , too blond and too thin , with tired eyes and shiny dark circles under them . " No thanks . I 'm fine . Really . " " Then come and talk to me a minute , my dear . I'vep170always wanted to know what goes on in Al 's office . I 'll bet he spends all his time making passes at the girls . That 's what men call work , is n't it ? " Hilda sat down with her , but not to discuss Mr. Herbert'soffice habits . Instead , she had to listen , or seem to listen , to the discomforts of Mrs. Herbert 's weekend in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , she reflectedgrimly as she looked around the room at the discontentedfaces , the nervously chatting mouths , come those who worship false gods . And suddenly she thought with a sick disillusionment of her last talk with Eloise and how she had been almost persuaded that if happiness beckoned , happiness should be pursued . That was why she was here , in this room , amid these terrible people , Bobbie 's friends . Maybe it was good for her ; maybe it was salutary to see them at their worst , just as it might be salutary that life was obliging her to face Eloise 's betrayal in all its enormity . For what was it , after all , but the final proof of her old theory about Eloise , that behind the charm there was a void , behind the airy kindness a moral emptiness ? And she thought with a shudder of Pearl Harbor Day , listening to the radio and watching her father 's face darken as he almost whispered : " Why , the little yellow bastards ! " But Eloise 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected her even then ? When Eloise had simply shaken her head sadly , as if to agree with him , to deplore everything ? No , Eloise believed in nothing , and she had been found out . They could all go back to living now . " Take it from me , my dear , and do n't go near the country , " Mrs. Herbert was saying . " Do you live with your family ? "  | " I live with my father . " " You know , dearie , I do n't think you should do that . I think every girl should be on her own . " Hilda kept glancing at the door , not even caring now how obvious she made her disapproval . She had almost made up her mind to leave without waiting for Bobbie when she heard his voice in the hall loudly greeting Mr. Herbert . As he came in it was very obvious that he had been drinking . He glanced rather blearily around the room and saw her . Immediately he raised his arm and whistled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , seemed to be in even worse shape than he , and Mrs. Herberthurried across the room to cope with her . Bobbie , however , seemed quite unconcerned ; he came over and sat heavily down in Mrs. Herbert 's place on the sofa . " Little Hilda , " he said , rather thickly , " who 'd have thought it ? Whatcha doin ' here ? I thought you were running away from me . Is n't that why you threw up your little job ? " " You 're quite wrong , " she said with dignity . " It was just that I 'd learned as much about being a receptionist as I thought I needed . You told me yourself there was nothing to it . " " Look , Hilda , do n't try to kid me . You were running away , and you know it . " She glanced around nervously to see if anyone was watching . " I would have told you about it , but you were away , Bobbie . You were off on that trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said rudely . " You were running away from me . It 's written all over you . " " It seems to be settled , then , " she said sharply , " that Ip172was running away . " He nodded his head , accepting her concession as though it were sincere . " And all because I took your family to that night club , " he said . " All because I tried to give them some sort of fun after that goddam boring show . Hell , I know I like parties . I like drinking , too . But only at parties . You and I have to face up to something , Hilda . Let 's not keep on avoiding facts . " Here he held out his glass to Mr. Herbertwho was passing by with the shaker . " I 'm just straightening this little girl out , Herb , " he said . " Why did n't you tell me she was going to be here ? I might have left that lynx at home . " He laughed loudly as he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be having an argument . " But to be serious , Hilda , " he continued , turning back to her as Mr. Herbert moved on , " to be absolutely serious  --  and dammit , why should n't we be ?  --  I think you 're a wonnerful girl . Not like the rest of this crew . " He took in the room with a careless gesture that upset a glass on the table beside him . " And you like me , too . You may not approve of me , but you like me , and you know it . " As he paused to pick up the pieces of glass on the rug and place them with slow carefulness on the table , she was able to realize that the moment was actually coming and that it had not caught her unprepared . She noticed each aspect of his condition , the way he slurred his words , the way he kept pushing his blond hair , now messy , back over his head , his clumsiness in picking up the pieces of broken glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side on the table . She shivered with the sudden cold/ness of her detachment , and it was almost with pride that she moved her shoulders , as if to feel the new freedom in the air around her , and looked him straight in the eye . " And what comes of facing these facts , as you call them , Bobbie ? " she asked . He shrugged his shoulders . " We may have to get married , " he said , closing one eye and squinting at the row of glass pieces on the table . " You may have to learn to put up with my friends . And I may have to learn to behave myself with your family . " He paused and swallowed in a final effort at articulation . " You may have to be nicer about my parties . And I may have to learn to put up with your abstem  --  abstemious-ness . " The severity of her stare at last penetrated even the thick coating of his good will . " You do n't like it ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , Bobbie , you 're a jerk . " " I assume I 'm not meant to be taking this any more seriously than anything else that is being said in this room , " she said in an even , grating tone . " I assume that I 'm not really expected to give you an answer . Or at least not until I 've had as many cocktails as you 've had . " He turned on her . " You know it 's serious ! " he exclaimed roughly . " You know damn well how serious it is ! And do n't try to kid yourself . " Their eyes met , and this time it was she who looked away . " It 's always been serious between us , " he went on , movingnearer to her . " And in case you do n't realize it , you'rep174the only girl I 've come this close to proposing to . Which is a compliment , the way I look at it , whether you like it or not . Why do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch on to yourself ? Why not , kid ? " And he suddenly put his arm around her shoulders . She jumped up in a passion of alarm . " Never ! " she exclaimed . " Never ! " She managed to control herself enough to say goodbye to Mrs. Herbert . She was even able , after a hurried dash for her coat , to stand with moderate dignity in the lobby as she waited for the elevator , though the front door was open and the eyes of the cocktail party , attracted by her sudden exit , were on her . She heard someone say somethingand mention Bobbie 's name ; it was followed by a general muffled laugh , mercifully cut short by the rumble of the opening elevator doors . Then there was the ride down as she stared at her shoes and at last the escape through the dark lobby to the fresh air of the street . It was free and cool and reassuring ; it was her element , unlike the smoky air which she had just left , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried down the sidewalk she made a final , desperate effort to enjoy the knowledge that she had met her test as George Dilworth 's daughter should have met it.  |p175ELOISE  HAD TAKEN a room adjoining her mother 's small suite at the Stafford . She had gone there because she had n't known where else to go and because it had seemedcruel not to let Irene , who professed to be almost distractedwith guilt , have an opportunity , at least in her own eyes , to make up in some fashion for the sorry , gossiping role that she had played . " I 'll never forgive myself , " she moaned to Eloise . " I had no idea he 'd be so violent . Oh , but he 's a horror , that George ! A brutal , vicious horror ! " " George is only being himself , Irene , " Eloise answered calmly . " I would not have expected him to behave other-wise . " " What must you think of me , my child ? " Irene raised her thin white hands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble and tragedy ? It sometimes seems to me that you 've spent your life just turning the other cheek . " " And here I am . Right back where I started from . " She could afford to be generous with Irene , for she had never been less involved with her . Irene 's remorse was probably sincere , as sincere , that is , as any feeling that Irene ever had , but Eloise had no need of it . She could not connecther mother 's meanness with the magnitude of what had happened ; it seemed almost presumptuous of Irene to cast herself in a causal role when she had been onlyp176the unwitting agent of the strange gods who had struck her daughter down . Ever since the departure of the detectiveand his men , when Eloise had raised her head from the pillow to face a Carl shaking with sobs of humiliation and anger , a Carl who had turned to her for sympathy like a small boy , ever since she had gone home to find her bags packed and waiting for her in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain of one thing . It was her own nemesis , to be handled her own way . She would share it with none , not even with Carl . The gods had been holding off their thunderbolt all her life . Now they had hurled it . It was doubtful if there was anything more under the sun for her to be afraid of . Not indeed that her path in the future was going to be plain sailing . Far from it . She had not been allowed even to see Peggy and Jo , although the nurse telephoned every day to tell her how they were . She had no idea what arrangementsGeorge would make about them or how she and Irene were going to live . The future was a white page . But at least she knew now the things which worried her . They were all in the open . She would do nothing , not even hire a lawyer , despite all of Irene 's protestations , until George made his next move . " We 'll wait to see what he offers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows where I am . And do n't worry . George is not a man who can bear to have things unsettled for long . " It turned out that George indeed was not , for the day after she said this Harry Hamilton called upon her . She received him alone in Irene 's little sitting room . He kept looking out the window as if the interview was boring and purely routine and pinching the bridge of his nose withp177his thumb and forefinger . His big , protruding eyes tumbledin their sockets . " I 've come on George 's behalf , " he began , shielding a sudden , unsettling yawn behind his fat palm , " to offer what I 'm sure you 'll agree are equitable terms under the circumstances . " She nodded and said nothing . " In the first place , " he continued with a little cough , " George has decided to bring an action of divorce against you . He has decided to bring it here , in New York . " " I see . " " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground for divorce in New York . " Harry sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose again . " It happens , however , to be preciselythe ground that George is relying on . " " Thanks to your carefulness , Harry . " His whole countenance , however , was bathed in a bland indifference to anything that she might have to say . " There 's no reason , I believe , that the proceedings should receive publicity , " he went on . " When both sides are agreed on that , such things can be arranged . Judges are normally averse to scandal . I assume there will be no difficulty about this with what I might describe as the more vulnerable of the two parties to the action ? " He looked up at the ceiling , touching and retouching his fingertips together , and she was suddenly sure that he had rehearsed this scene to the last gesture . She had been wrong about many people , she reflected quickly , but not about Harry . He had always hated her . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Publicitymight be valuable to me . I ca n't tell yet . " Harry continued to gaze at the ceiling.  | " I should have thought you might have considered the welfare of your children in this respect . " " You can be sure I shall consider it , Harry Hamilton ! " she exclaimed , giving in suddenly to a sharp stab of temper . " That 's exactly why I do n't intend to throw away any potential weapon I may have . What does George propose to do about the girls ? " He paused . " Do you have a lawyer ? " " No . " " But you will have ? " " Obviously , I 'll have to . " " It would be wise . " He nodded . " But that need n't stop us now . All I want is to tell you what George 's offer is . It 's very simple . He will give you five thousand a year , for life or until your remarriage . This , considering that a court would probably award you nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , of course , retain sole custody of the two girls , but he is willing to give you his informal assurance that when you have established to his satisfaction that you are leading a life the example of which is beneficial to the children , he will allow them to visit you at such times and in such places as he may designate . " She grasped the side of her chair . " You ca n't mean it ! " " On the contrary I most certainly mean it . " " And if I refuse this ridiculous offer ? " Harry 's shrug was monumental . " The financial offer would then , of course , lapse . And we would have no alternative but to go to court and try the question of your fitness as a parent . " " Why mine and not his ? "  | " Is n't that fairly obvious ? " She gave a shudder of distaste . " As if a man who did what George has done to me could possibly be a fit parent , " she answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court ? " " The judge would probably talk to them in his cham-bers . " She thought of Jo excitedly telling a dark robed figure about the murder of William Wallace 's wife and Peggy trying to stop her , trying , as Peggy always did , to identify herself with the adult side . She raised her hands instinctivelyas though to shield them , dropping them a second later and staring with a certain awe at this man who could say such things to her . " You must be enjoying this , Harry , " she said . " I suppose it 's the only way you get your pleasure . " He simply stared at her with a blankness that was meant , she assumed , to be annihilating . " I wonder if our courts will go along with you , " she continued . " I wonder if it 's possible for people like you to do such things to people like me . I think it may be importantfor me to find that out . More important , perhaps , than anything else . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat and cane . Watching his slow movements she reflected how useful it was for censorious people to be fat . They needed surface for the full expression of their venom . " Tell me one thing , Harry , " she asked him . " I 'm beginning to see , now that I face true antagonism , that I used to imagine it in situations where it did n't actually exist . But I did n't imagine yours , did I ? You 've always hated me . And I have no conception of why . What did I ever do top180you that you should hate me so ? " He turned toward the door . " Get a lawyer , Eloise , " he said , ignoring her question . " Get a lawyer and tell him what I 've told you . He 'll tell you that it makes sense . If he 's any good , he will . " No sooner had he left than Irene emerged explosively from her bedroom . " Eloise , who do you think is downstairs waiting to see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away , of course , but he wo n't . My God , do you suppose Mr. Hamilton will see him as he goes out the lobby ! " " I neither know nor care what Mr. Hamilton sees , " Eloise said sharply , getting up and going to the telephone . " And you had no business , Irene , to tell Carl to go away . I shall make my own decisions about my own visitors . " " Eloise , what are you going to do ! " " I 'm going to ask him to come right up . " " My child , do n't be crazy ! " Irene was across the room in a moment , both her hands on the telephone . " You 've got to consider how things look . You 're not your own boss any more , dear girl . " " On the contrary , it 's just exactly what I am . And for the first time , too . What difference can it possibly make whether or not I see Carl ? Harry Hamilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head violently . " He has one incident , " she said , holding up her forefingersolemnly . " One single miserable little incident . That may get him his divorce , yes , but what about the children ? What will a judge think if you continue brazenly to see this boy in your room ? " " Irene , you were listening at the door ! "  |p181Her  mother brushed this aside . " Of course , I was listening . How else am I to protect you against yourself ? We 're going to prove to that court that you 're a better mother than George if it 's the last thing we do ! And we 're not going to do it by entertaining Carl Landik up here ! " Eloise hesitated . The vision of Jo talking to the blackrobedfigure flashed again across her mind . But it was degrading , soul destroying , this sudden reduction of her life to a chattering monologue played out before the respectabilityof suspicion . " You mean I ca n't see him at all ? " she protested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's so mean , Irene . The poor boy is sick over this whole thing . I owe it to him . " Irene sat in the chair by the telephone , guarding the instrument with one hand and picking at her scarlet lower lip with a long fingernail . The picture of Carl brooding in the lobby had evidently touched her readily available sympathies . " We might go down , I suppose , " she said at last . " Both of us , I mean . We could see him in the lounge . " " Or the bar . " " No , the lounge . We 'll have tea . " " Tea , Irene ? That sounds so odd , coming from you . " " Well , you 'll see . " Irene nodded , quite happy with her own ingenuity . " No one could think that tea was wicked . And , after a bit , I might even stroll up and down the lounge and let you and Carl talk . But not for long . It must n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , after a pause . " We 'll try it your way . This time . "  |p182They  were a strange threesome , she reflected , when they were seated in a corner of the lounge , she and her mother on a dark couch and Carl in a tall Italian chair placed at right angles to them with a potted palm between . Carl looked utterly miserable and could hardly say a word . Irene 's spirits , however , were high . She loved conspiracy , ordering tea in a brisk , cheerful voice which she dropped to a whisper the moment the waiter had gone , warning Carl , with a good deal of head-nodding , about the necessity of precaution . Eloise watched him listening reluctantly , humbly . And suddenly it was not just strange any more . It was horrible . " Irene , " she said suddenly , " is n't it perhaps time for that little stroll of yours ? " Her mother started at her tone . " All right , dear . But , remember , I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be out of sight . " " Sometimes I think Irene really cares , " Eloise said to him as her mother moved away across the lobby . " But more often I wonder if she 's ever had a better time in her life . " " Eloise , " Carl said quickly , moving over to the sofa , " there must be something I can do ? " She shook her head . " For God 's sake , Eloise ! " " But there is n't , Carl , dear . That 's the thing about lovers . There is n't a thing they can do . " " Do n't talk that way . " She simply shrugged her shoulders . " How do you want me to talk ? This is one thing that I have to face alone . It 's so obvious , Carl . But do n't look glum . I want to face it alone . "  |p183Carl  was at his most restless . One arm ran along the back of the couch ; the other was raised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk as if you were a sophomore and I was nothing but a punk freshman , " he said sullenly . " I want to do something in this mess . I 've got to do something . Even if it 's only punching that rotten husband of yours in the eye . " " That would be so helpful . " " Well , it would show him how I feel , anyway . I lie awake at night worrying if that bastard could possibly be thinking that I 'm ashamed of myself . Hell , I was n't takingany part of you that he cared about , and you know that 's true , Eloise . And how he can sit there , that stuffed shirt of a dog in the manger  --  " " Please , Carl . This does n't help . " " But it 's the truth , Eloise ! " " What does it matter ? If you only knew how little I worry about George ! The only thing that matters is that I do n't want the girls handed over to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " That 's not the only thing that matters , " he objected , his lower jaw forward . " There 's another thing that matters . One hell of a lot , too . To me , anyway . I want to marry you , Eloise . Just as soon as Dilworth gets his di-vorce . " She sat there , absolutely still , feeling a constriction about her heart that was at once exhilarating and threatening . In her sudden excitement she lost her confidence and wondered if she could rise to this , even conversationally , if she would n't antagonize him by saying something fatuous and flat.  | " Oh , Carl , " she murmured , " you are sweet . " " I 'm not sweet at all , " he said indignantly . " I mean it . I love you , Eloise . This is n't just a gallant gesture . You know what I think of gallant gestures . Do n't you believe me , Eloise ? " " I believe you . " She nodded nervously . " Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding you to it . " He grabbed her hand . " Do you love me , Eloise ? " he demanded . " You must or you would n't have come the other night . " She stared at him for a moment and then nodded soberly . " I suppose I must , " she agreed . The words sounded incrediblein the big dark lobby with the passing people . She saw a fat man , as fat as Harry Hamilton , walking towards the elevator followed by a porter carrying an enormousbag . She wondered indifferently what he would think if he could hear her . " But it 's very hard for me to tell . You see I do n't think I 've ever loved anyone before . I 'm not even sure I 've ever even liked anyone before . " He looked confused . " But you will marry me ? " " Oh , that does n't follow at all , " she said , leaning her head back and closing her eyes for a moment . She wondered , without really thinking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed irrelevant . " I 'm older and more married , and I have two children , and the circumstancesare awful , and , oh , Carl , there are so many things . " " Not if we love each other , " he said stubbornly . " Darling , I could n't possibly discuss it now , " she said , sitting up suddenly . " Maybe after the case , but not now . Nothing seems quite real to me now . I wonder if it does to you , either , you poor boy . We 'll both be more sensiblep185later . Now do n't say anything , " she continued as he was about to speak , putting a finger to his lips . " Listen to me . I want you to keep away from this whole wretched trial . If they call you , that 's one thing , but I do n't see why they should . I 'm not fighting the facts . But for my sake , Carl , stay away until I send for you . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'm going to run out on you . . . " " Darling , it is n't running out on me , it 's helping me . " " I do n't care . I do n't like it . " " Carl ! " Her voice was sharp , peremptory . " You must do as I say . Someone must do as I say . " " Am I too soon ? " came a voice from above them , and there was Irene , actually simpering , with a waiter pushing a wheeled tea tray . " No , dear , you 're just right , " Eloise said quickly , " Carl has been very sweet . He wants to help , but of course there 's nothing he can do . I 've told him to write me . You 'll do that , Carl , wo n't you ? And one day soon we 'll be seeingeach other again . When all this is over . " Irene sat down , and Eloise turned her attention to the tea things . Carl said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Irene tried to catch his attention by handing him his cup that he spoke , and then it was only to mutter an excuse and hurry away . Irene gazed after him , her mouth open . " Your young man , I must say , has charming manners . " Eloise looked after his retreating figure and then turned back to the teapot . " I wonder if I really believe in good manners , " she said.  |p186GERALD  HUNT 'S office , as might have been expected , was the largest and certainly the most impressive of the partners ' offices of Hunt &; Livermore . He sat in one corner with his back to a large window that commanded a view of the Hudson , protected from his visitors not by a desk but by a long , rectangular eighteenth-centuryFrench table . The green walls were hung with charcoaldrawings of eminent contemporaries , signed by the subjects . In an alcove over the bookstand rested a large bronze bust of the late Justice Hunt , Gerald 's and Irene 's father , with the aquiline nose that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like his partners , usually left the door of his office open , but today it was closed , and his elderly secretary , Miss Chotsworth , had received instructions that he would see no visitors and take no calls while Messrs . Dilworth and Hamilton were with him . He was leaning back in his chair , his hands folded in his lap , his eyes fixed on George who was seated in the chair opposite . Harry was strolling slowly back and forth across the room , his hands behind his back , his eyes rolling listlessly from picture to picture . " I want to make one thing entirely clear , " Gerald was saying , " and that is that I 've tried to keep this whole tragic business out of the office . My first reaction , aside from my obvious personal distress , was that it must not be allowedp187to affect our relationships downtown . I pride myself that it has not . George and I were friends before his marriage , and we will be friends after his divorce . Is n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gerald . " Gerald glanced at him and turned slightly away in his chair , one finger raised to his mustache . He did not like the brooding expression on George 's face or his quick , rather belligerent assumption that everyone was on his side . Gerald had never been much of a side taker . He rarely cared enough , one way or the other . It mattered very little to him as a man or as a moralist whether Eloise was unfaithful to George or George to Eloise , but as the latter 's uncle and as head of the Hunt family he could not be entirely indifferent to what was now being done to her . George 's assumption of his partisanship seemed to take for granted that friendship , especially friendship for George , should transcend blood loyalties . Gerald was quite sure that this was a decision that George was not going to make for him . " Good . Very good , " he said , stroking his mustache and nodding . " We 've got that out of the way , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole sad business that I want to discuss here . The part of it , in other words , that affects the firm . Harry tells me , George , that he has instituteddivorce proceedings on your behalf in New York County . He says that you have named Mr. Landik as corespondent . " " I have . Is there anything wrong with that ? " Gerald did not look at him this time . " I think you might have consulted me before doing that ,  |p188George  , " he said in a milder , drier tone . " I saw no reason for it . " " You did n't ? I 'm sorry . " Gerald picked up a silver paper cutter and examined its edge . " It did n't occur to you that such a case might involve considerable publicity ? Not only for yourself and your family but for your partners and possibly even your clients ? " " If there 's any publicity it will be because of your niece , " George retorted . " If you wish to avoid it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gerald turned , his eyebrows slightly raised , and saw that he had read correctly the truculence in George 's tone . " I have no intention of trying to persuade Eloise of anything , George , " he said sharply and decisively . " I have no intention of getting mixed up in your affairs any more than I already am . What I want to know is why , when all other civilized people go quietly to Reno or the Virgin Islands to get their divorces , you and Eloise must stay here and wash your dirty linen in public . " He turned abruptly to Harry . " Can you answer that one , Harry ? You 're handling the case . You presumably advised bringing the suit here . " " I think I can answer that one , Gerald . " Harry 's equanimity was almost insulting in view of the senior partner'sexpressed concern . He stopped his roving and stood before Gerald 's desk , his hands clasped behind his back , his eyes blinking . " It 's very simple . George is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose to let the state of Nevada or any other state or territory , for that matter , hand over half his income and the custody of his children to a woman who under the laws of New York might bep189entitled to neither . As I say , it 's unusual . " Harry 's face became even blanker to point up his sarcasm . " It has becometraditional for the husband , wronged or otherwise , to submit himself to the tender mercies of any state whose divorce laws are drafted by its chamber of commerce and whose climate is agreeable to his wife . " Gerald closed his lips tightly and turned his chair away . He had always detested Harry and his airs of superiority . It did not help , either , that he knew that Harry looked down on him as a lawyer which to Harry was identical with looking down on him as a man . " You 're off the point , Harry , " he said gruffly . " I have n't heard that Eloise is asking for any half of George 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to have her children with her half the year . Surely that 's fair enough . " " Does it not occur to you , Gerald , " Harry asked with a slight lift of the eyebrows , " that George may not wish his daughters to spend any part of the year with a mother who finds adultery to be within the scope of her marriage vows ? " Gerald considered for a moment asking Harry to leave the room . Rarely , however , did he act on impulse . " Surely you do n't think , George , " he said , turning to the latter and ignoring Harry altogether , " that this mistake of Eloise 's , reprehensible and regrettable as it is , means that she 's no longer fit to bring up her own children ? " " I most certainly do . Until she 's proved to me that she 's ashamed of herself , anyway . " " I doubt very much if most people would agree with you , " Gerald continued severely . " Those little girls seem to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go/ing to become the devil 's advocate overnight . " " How do I know she has n't always been ? " George demanded in sudden anger , clenching his fists . " How do I know she has n't been undermining them for years ? I never knew she had this rottenness in her till three weeks ago . Oh , I know , most people smooth these things over , cover them up  --  anything to avoid publicity or to keep the children from finding out when they get older . Maybe children should find out . Adultery to me is a serious business , Gerald . I happen to believe in keeping the vows I take . There 's too much moral flabbiness in the world today , and I do n't want any part of it . For myself or my children . " Gerald looked down at the blotter before him and fingeredagain his silver paper cutter . It always embarrassed him when people claimed to be guided specifically by the general principles to which society professed adherence . Gerald was too much a man of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to individual problems anything but the crudest possible taste . He professed many principles himself ; few people , indeed , professed more ; that was the way one lived , it was the secret , perhaps , of civilization . But to premise one 's conduct on their absolute relation to reality , well , that was being childish , and being childish was something that the son of a famous judge had little or no time for . " You 're going too far , George , " he warned him , shaking his head . " People are n't going to like this . You 'll find them going over to Eloise 's side . " " I do n't give a damn whose side they 're on , " George retorted . " I intend to dissolve my marriage according to thep191laws of my state and to bring up my children according to the principles in which I believe . And I do n't consider that anyone 's business but my own . " " You do n't care , in other words , about the reputation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone that rose as he spoke to a higher pitch of indignation . " You do n't care how I 'm made to look , the uncle who stands by while his niece is disgraced in public by his own partner ! You do n't care that by the time Harry has got through with his circus , this firm and the scandal will be on the lips of every purchaser of an evening paper ! " George 's expression did not change . He never took his eyes from Gerald 's face . " If you 're implying , Gerald , that you think I should disassociate myself from the firm before the case comes to trial , I can only say that I 'm quite willing to do so . Harry and I have already discussed the possibility that you might feel this way . He has been kind enough to say that his actions will be governed by mine . " Gerald was too cautious at first to glance up from his desk . He continued for a moment simply to play with his paper cutter . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps we 're all getting a little hot under the collar , " he said , standing up . " And that 's never apt to be a good thing , is it ? I did n't realize , George , how strongly you felt about this . Obviously if you feel that way , you must act accordingly . I do n't deny I 'm sorry about it , for everyone 's sake . I simply wanted to be sure how things stood . Let 's not say any more about it for the time being , shall we ? Thank you , gentlemen . " When they had gone Gerald turned his chair aroundp192and gazed out over the harbor . It had not been a time to be dictatorial ; he had been right to check himself when he had . He did n't even know , for example , how Arthur Irwin would stand if George left the firm , and Arthur 's company paid an annual retainer three times the size of their next largest . Arthur , of course , was his contemporary and nominally his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of his work , and Gerald knew better than to underrate such things . No , decidedly it was not the time to take a high hand . If he could be sure of Arthur  --  well , that would be different . Then George could be chastened . And George needed chastening ; he was gettingdogmatic and arbitrary . The future senior partner  --  if indeed he was to be that  --  should not be as rigid as George had just shown himself . He was good , yes , but nobody was indispensable . And as for Harry  --  Gerald bit into his pipe and smiled rather wryly to himself . Harry had certainly gone as far in Hunt &; Livermore as Harry was ever going . George and Harry in the meanwhile walked down the passageway to George 's office without exchanging a word . When George went in he paused near the door , hoping that Harry would go back to his own room , but the latter followed him in and closed the door behind him . " Do you think you should have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you think you should have said what you did about our resigning ? " " Do n't worry , Harry . He wo n't do a thing . He would n't dare . I doubt if he could even run the firm without you and me . " " Maybe so . But does he know that ? "  | " I said do n't worry , Harry . " He went over to his desk and sat down , spinning his chair so that he faced towards the window . He knew that he should n't let Harry see his irritation , considering all that Harry was doing for him , but he knew that otherwiseHarry would go on and on with the subject , twisting his way deviously into its most painful corners , sucking his private peculiar satisfaction out of anticipating the very thing that he most dreaded , his own and George 's separationfrom the firm that was fundamentally Harry 's life . It was all very well for Harry to be impertinent to Gerald when George was present , but George knew only too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry 's big frame . And the last thing he could face now was to spend the afternoon consoling Harry ; the only thing he wanted and needed was to get back to work . He had made up his mind , and he had no intention of changingit , for Gerald or anyone else , but if they kept talking about it , if he and Harry had to waste all their time speculatingon the possible consequences to themselves and everyone else , even he , George , might lose his nerve . " Do you think Eloise really means to fight ? " Harry continued . " Or do you think she 's bluffing ? " " How should I know ? " George said impatiently . " You were the one who talked to her . " " Yes , but I 'd never seen that side of her before . I 'd never seen her so cocky , George . " " Maybe she 's learned it from Mr. Landik , " George said bitterly , turning back to his desk . " Will you excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this mess as it is. "  | " Certainly . I was just going . " And he left , trying too hard not to look offended . Alone , George stared across the room at the mahogany breakfront which held the large black volumes of his bound registration statements . On its top , in place of the silver-framed photograph of Eloise , stood a round gold clock with discs where the numbers should have been . It was solid and heavy as he liked such things to be , and fixing his eyes on it he tried to calm himself by emulating its stillness . The terrible anger that had swept over him when Harry had telephoned him in Chicago , that had churned him up until he had been physically ill , had cooled by now to a grim but still seething determination to make Eloise pay for what she had done . Yet as he continued to stare at the clock its very expressionlessness seemed to take on some of the expressionlessness of Eloise 's face , a quality which now , in the light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property , as it were , he equated with self-assurance , an air almost of defiance , an attitude of " But did you really think , poor man , after all these years  --  ? " Christ ! There it was coming back again , that destroying temper , that waste of energy and feeling , and what in the name of heaven was the point of it now , with Harry irrevocably delegated to carry out the whole wretched plan ? He took the draft of the prospectus for Arthur Irwin 's new bond issue and held it fixedly before him while he forced his eyes to read and his mind to concentrate . Very slowly the words began to take on sense and his brain to turn over ; he sighed , hardly daring to recognize his own relief , and suddenly he caught a point , the burying of a factory alteration in a mass of verbiage ,  |p195the  very thing against which he had warned the younger partner who had prepared the draft . Eloise left his mind immediately . Picking up the telephone to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chuckle of satisfactionat the thought of Arthur browbeating a junior partner into doing the prospectus his way . They would pay anything , these tycoons , to retain George Dilworth and yet do anything to get around him . " No , Arthur , it wo n't do , " he began immediately when he had him on the telephone . " I 've said so before , and I 'm sticking to it . It 's like describing a man by saying he has two eyes , a nose and a mouth . Not a misrepresentation , perhaps , but if the boys on the commission pick it up , they 'll jump to the conclusion that you 've got something to hide . And the point is you have n't . That 's what I never seem to be able to drive through the heads of some of you tycoons , that you have n't really got anything to hide  --  " Harry Hamilton , in the meanwhile , had returned to his own office and sent for Tom Haighter , his selected assistantin Dilworth versus Dilworth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been instructed always to do when this particular litigation was discussed . " I 've just been in with Mr. Hunt , " Harry could n't resist telling him confidentially as he sat down before his desk . " The old man is fussed up over this suit . No doubt about it . But he 'll live . He 'll live . Have you finished that memo on custody ? " He reached out his hand as he asked this and received the expected memorandum . It was the custom in Hunt &; Livermore for all partners , even Harry , to be politely reasonable in estimating the time required for a piece ofp196work . To hear them discussing this with their associates one might have assumed that a leisurely , almost a Southern atmosphere prevailed in the office . There were none so benighted , however , as to be unaware of the brief future that would await a clerk who availed himself of every deadline . Harry skimmed the pages of the memorandum while its author looked nervously on . It failed , however , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal principles which it explored . It was frequently this way with memoranda that Harry ordered . He believed in the discipline of them . " Well , " he said impatiently , tossing the memo aside , " what do you really think ? Do we get the children or do n't we ? " " I think it 's close , sir . " " Why ? " " I do n't know if she deserves to lose her children . Just for that . " Here Tom looked suddenly abashed . " Just for one time , I mean . " Harry held up his forefinger . " One time proved , you mean , " he corrected . " One time proved . Yes , sir . " " How many times would you give her ? And with how many men ? " Tom looked uncomfortable . " Well , I do n't know if I could name a number , sir  --  " Harry held up both hands to interrupt him . " Enough , enough , " he said quickly . " I agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be enough to depriveher of custody . Conceded . But suppose she 's proud of it ? Suppose she glories in it ? "  |p197Tom  looked astonished . His round , healthy face was blank . " But will she ? " " Oh , youth , youth , " Harry murmured , " where is the fight in youth ? " " But even if she thought that , she would n't say so , would she ? Not in court anyway . " Harry slammed his hand down on his desk . " You mean that Mrs. Dilworth is a liar as well as an adulteress ? " " Oh , I do n't say that , sir . " " What do you say , then ? " Harry exclaimed abruptly , and then as suddenly he was silent again , apparently lost in his own thoughts . " No , Eloise is truthful , " he continued in a more reflective tone . " That 's the thing about Eloise . And it 's on her truthfulness that we must hang her . " " On her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Harry looked up quickly . " Right ? " he roared . " Of course , it would be right . What do you know of right and wrong , you babe in swaddling tweeds ? It 's right that she should tell the truth , and it 's right that the court should hear the truth , and it 's right that the court should award the children to George ! " Tom looked sullen . Awed as he was by Harry , there were still things that he could resent . " Well , if that 's all there is to it , why is there any case for us to prepare ? " he grumbled . " Why do n't we just sit back and let her talk ? " " Because she will have a lawyer , " Harry replied with a smile of sarcastic sweetness , folding his hands beforep198him on the desk . " We must assume that he knows what we know . We must assume that he , too , knows of her tendency to tell the truth . And he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell the truth ? " " Oh , Tom . " Harry shook his hands reproachfully in the air . " Tom , please . You must not be so crude . Let us assume that Eloise will not retain a complete ass . No , dear boy , he will simply coach her to be humble , to play the repentant wife , to assure the court with wide , shining eyes "  --  here Harry rolled his own lugubriously  --  " that never again will such a dreadful thing take place , that she was bewitched , that she can not understand what could have happened to her  --  " " And she 'll say all that ? " " She will be so coached . " " And you 'll make her deny it , sir ? How ? " Harry settled back in his chair with an almost dreamlikeexpression in his eyes . " You see , Tom , " he replied , tapping a ruler slowly against the palm of his left hand , " I know Eloise . I know her type . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , a sentimentalist . She has a highly confused sense of honor . Incapable of facing the badness in herself , the badness which we inherit from Adam and which only the realist is willing to face , she will try to dress up her act of adultery in moral colors . It was sweet , therefore it must be good . Is n't that the romantic fallacy ? The more I yearn and yearn , the more I feel , the more I smell spring in the air , the more my heart pounds , the better a person I am . " Here Harry clasped his own shoulders with each hand ,  |p199closed  his eyes and rocked his big body back and forth , pursing his lips . " And they 'll go to the stake for their idea of themselves , " he said sharply , opening his eyes suddenly and sitting up . " I 've seen them do it ! " Tom , who had been staring at him , looked bewildered . " They will ? " " Of course , they will ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then proceeded to destroy with heavy pounds his little caricature of the romantic with which he was disgusted to see that Tom had even temporarily identified him . But it was that way with all these blocky young men . Their minds  --  minds , did he call them ?  --  were hopelessly literal . " The martyr , however , must be held to a certain pitch of excitement if he is to proclaim his faith to those who find it heresy . That is where we come in . I propose to define Eloise 's adultery before her in such a way as to make her angry . I propose to fling it in her face until she loses her temper . I propose to make her swallow it until she gags . And when I finally demand of her , in ringing tones , if she is not ashamed of her dark deed , I think we can count on her denial . " " And then ? " " And then , of course , we 'll have her , " Harry answered with only a shrug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She wo n't be able to wriggle out of it . Justice will be served , and morality . And truth . Do n't forget that , Tom . Truth ! For I , with all my fulminating , will be sayingwhat I truly believe about adulterers , and she , with all her indignation , will be stating her own faith in herself . The truth will be before the court , and the court , as is quite proper , will apply the law of the land . "  | " Unless she sways the judge . " " In which case we will be victorious on appeal . " There was a pause , and Tom nodded doubtfully . " I guess it sounds all right , sir . " Harry smiled more affably . " I 'll look over your memo later , Tom . There may be some points in it I can use . " He shrugged his shoulders again as the young man left the room . He knew that Tom still had doubts as to the morality of his procedure , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom 's admiration of the tactical advantages of his approach . For that was the way with these young men . They had really no moral values at all . No matter what was said against Harry Hamilton in the office , he knew that they could be counted on to pucker their brows , shake their heads and murmur , almost with surprise that any other value counted to anyone else : " But he 's a damn good lawyer . You 've got to admit that . Yes sir , that baby 's smart . " It was an adulation that he ' had always expected from them and that he had always received ; he had loved it and depended on it , but it was not enough , at least not enough to a man like himself who wanted everything from them , who would never really believe they did n't secretly despise him unless they accordedhim enthusiasm on every level , not simply the intellectual . Yet they would n't , of course , any more than Gerald would ; they would n't even give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that he did believe in , in George 's rightness and Eloise 's wrongnessand in the importance , the vital importance , that George be upheld in all his contentions . For they , all thep201young men , the world , were the real cynics ; fundamentally nothing surprised or shocked them ; they fornicated and took fornicating for granted ; they were the cruel ones , not he , for they were willing to apply punishment to crimes which they did n't subjectively regard as crimes . Yet he , unlike them , believed in these crimes ; he believed in the law of the land , and he was alone in his belief . Except for George . He thought with feeling of the first evening that he had spent in George 's apartment after the terrible discovery . Poor George had been like a madman , and he had sat with him , hour after hour , or so it had seemed , refilling his scotch and soda and quietly listening as his poor friend paced the floor of his study and cursed his wife . Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even then  --  had it not struck him that there was a rejecting quality in the hard ego of George 's temper ? It was as if George took him a little too much for granted , as if he assumed too readily that Harry was immediately available as the instrument of his wrath . And then , too , when the wrath had simmered down to be succeeded by the more enduring mood of cold and determined anger which Harry now faced , had he not begun a little to wonder if the new George would even be as intimate a friend as the old ? It was all so unfair , and it was all the fault of that woman ! It was still the fruit of her adultery.  |p202WHEN  HILDA WALKED out of the Herberts ' cocktail party , leaving Bobbie to be laughed at by those in the room who had observed their altercation , he was determined that he was through with her . " I 'm glad she made a fool of me , " he kept telling Elaine sullenly as he continued to drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No girl 's ever treated me the way she has . " " And do you love it ! " Elaine said scornfully . " You 've always wanted to be made a fool of . You 're bored with little girls who fall for your big blue eyes . " " Oh , dry up , " he retorted . " I 'm getting pretty sick of that theory of yours . " The image of Hilda that stuck in his mind was of a prim , exasperating creature who had no business to have any hold over him at all . He found himself constructing elaborate and rather vindictive fantasies in one of which , the most frequently recurring , he courted her under an assumed guise of meekness and sobriety only to fling it off , once she was his , and take her , a pale , quivering Christian slave , to scenes of Roman debauchery . He pictured the pain in her eyes with a grim satisfaction . The direction of his thoughts , however , was drastically altered by a piece of gossip that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have you heard about your friend Hilda 's father ? "  | " What ? Is he dead or something ? " " Maybe he wishes he was . " Al laughed easily . " He 's just brought a divorce action against his wife . Named some young writer corespondent . I heard about it in court this morning . " Bobbie was too stunned to say anything . " That 's something to have happen to that bunch of stuffs down at Hunt &; Livermore , is n't it ? " Al continued . " Boy , I 'll bet Gerald Hunt is having kittens . " " Who 's Mrs. Dilworth 's lawyer ? " " No idea . But he 's got a job on his hands . They say Dilworth really has the goods on her . Pictures and all . " " The swine ! " " What 's that ? " " I said , the swine . " Al laughed . " I bet your friend Hilda does n't take that attitude . " " No , " Bobbie nodded bitterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unable to do any work that afternoon . He kept thinking of Mrs. Dilworth and her large , smiling , scared eyes . It was as if he and she had a sudden bond , having each suffered a deep injustice from the Dilworth tribe , as if it was Hilda 's puritanism , so stubborn and so archaic , that had risen to strike them down together . No wonder , he reflected grimly , that Hilda had been so excited at the Herberts ' . She must have known then that her little world had been knocked to pieces . He finally went downtown , canceling his appointments for the rest of the day , to the Supreme Court at Foley Square where a clerk , who was a friend of his , got out the record of Dilworth vs . Dilworth . There he found George 's complaint , setting forth its brutalp204facts in the turgid legal phrases that were so well adapted to the promulgation of hate . He also found an affidavit showing that it had been served on Eloise Dilworth at the Stafford Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry Weavers . They sat up late and drank lots of beer , but Larry always came back to the same point . " What can you do about it , Bobbie ? After all , it 's Dilworth'smarriage , not yours . We do n't even know what provocation the guy had . She may have been cheating on him for years . " Bobbie looked at him peevishly . Larry , the playboy , the libertine , Larry , tomorrow 's stuffed shirt . " I do n't think anyone ought to spy on anyone else . Husbands included . " " Okay . " Larry finished his can of beer . " And when you do the world over , that 's the way it 'll be . " " And it 'll be a damn sight better world , too . " " Maybe . Now go to bed . " And when Bobbie made no move , he went on : " After all , it 's Hilda 's headache , not yours . And I 'll bet Hilda is n't losing any sleep over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no . " Bobbie shook his head morosely . " She 's behind the old man . All the way . That 's one thing you can bet on . But I want her to know what I think of her , Larry . I want her to know that I think that she and her old man are wrong . Rotten wrong ! " " Oh , what the hell , Bobbie . " " You do n't see it . Of course not . You have n't been around with her . " Bobbie began to get excited . " The point is , Larry , she 's right about a lot of things . I dop205drink a lot , and I like fast women . Granted . But she thinks because of that I have no standards at all . And God damn it , I do have standards ! Higher ones than her old man 's , too , even if she is always raving about him . Why , I would n't file a smutty petition like that in court for anything in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry yawned and shrugged his shoulders . " Maybe she 'll let you be her lawyer . That 'll show them . If she does n't throw you out as a goddam ambulance chaser . " Bobbie got up . He had been trying all night to get Larry to say this . " It 's just exactly what I will do ! " he exclaimed . " Just exactly what I 'll do ! " " But not tonight , Bobbie , " Larry protested wearily . " Let 's not go tonight . " The next day Bobbie left his office at five and walked across town to the Stafford . When he sent up his name word came back that Mrs. Dilworth was out , but that she was expected back shortly . Mrs. Bleecker would see him , however , if he cared to go up . He got the impression from the clerk that Mrs. Bleecker would see anybody . " Who 's she ? " he asked . " Mrs. Dilworth 's mother . " " Oh . Well , okay . " He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand by a daughter in time of crisis , and he was startled when he saw Irene 's thin , gaunt figure in the doorway and heard her deep voice . " Mr. Chapin ? Wo n't you come in , please . Eloise should be back any minute . "  |p206He  came in and sat down rather awkwardly on the sofa , leaning forward so as not to crush the floppy doll behind him . " Let me take Berthe away , " she said , leaning over to remove the doll . " There . " She sat down in the deep armchairand looked up at him , her dark eyes curious . " Could you be the Mr. Chapin whom Eloise has told me about ? The one who 's a friend of Hilda 's ? " " I guess so . More or less . " " How do you mean , more or less ? " " Well , I 'm not exactly in Hilda 's good books at the moment . Sort of a lovers ' quarrel , you might say . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sullenly , he did n't give a damn . " I see . " She nodded . " Then you and Hilda , I take it , are lovers . " He looked up sharply and saw that she was laughing at him . He took out his case and offered her a cigarette . " You 're quite a sporty old dame , are n't you ? " " And you , Mr. Chapin , " she said , accepting his cigarette , " are quite a fresh young man . " " So we 're even . " " Exactly . And perhaps now that we 're even you 'll tell me what it is that I can do for you ? " " You forget , Mrs. Bleecker , " he said , wagging his finger at her . " I came to see your daughter . " She looked at him suspiciously . " You 're sure you have n't come from George Dil-worth ? " " That stuffed shirt ? Do I look it ? " At this Irene got up and went to the sideboard. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I are going to be friends , after all . George is a stuffed shirt . I 've thought so from the beginning . Let me give you a drink . " He noticed that she poured the martinis into the shaker from a gin bottle that had a label " mixed " pasted to its side . When he tasted his , he found that it was very dry indeed . " What I 've really come for is to find out if your daughterneeds any help , " he said in a friendlier tone , settling back on the sofa . " I 'm not looking for a job or a fee or anything like that . But it 's a field I know something about , and if she 'd like to know who are the good lawyers and who are n't  --  " " But it 's what I keep telling her ! " Irene interrupted . " She must have a lawyer ! " " Then she has n't got one ? " " No ! She 's been sitting around , completely distraite . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The efficiency , I take it , has been all on the other side . " " Oh , yes . There 's been no end of it there . " " Tell me , Mrs. Bleecker , " he said , leaning forward , " what about Dilworth ? If we were as efficient as he is , could we catch him at anything ? " He watched her as she looked down at her long scarlet fingernails . Obviously he would get things out of her that he would never get out of Eloise . " I 'm afraid not , " she said , looking up at him . " I 'm afraid you do n't understand George . He 's not interested in women . It 's funny . You know , there 's no country in the world with more sexual curiosity than ours . Everyonethinks there 's always something terrific going on inp208his neighbor 's house . And very often there is . But not always . That 's what I 'm smart enough to have learned about America , Mr. Chapin . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George ? " he amplified . " Was n't he even interested in his beautiful wife ? " " He has n't been for some time , " she said , shaking her head firmly . " No , when I said nothing , I meant nothing . George is one of those who sublimates his sexual energy in his profession . He and Eloise have n't lived together , in the real sense of the word , for years . " He looked up suddenly . " Are you sure of that ? " " Of course , I 'm sure . Eloise told me so herself . But do you think she 'd ever use that ? Oh , no . She 'd let him walk all over her first . " They had n't heard the door in the lobby open , and they both started when they heard Eloise 's voice . " Would I , Irene ? Let who walk over me ? " She came in as she said this , taking off her gloves , a dry little smile on her face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She stopped as she took in Bobbie 's face and then her smile broadened and the dryness disappeared . " Why , it 's Mr. Chapin . Hilda 's friend . " He got up to shake her hand , struck by the fact that she was even lovelier than he remembered . Her large blue eyes seemed to have lost some of their timidity . " He wants to be your lawyer , Eloise , " Irene explained rapidly to cover her indiscretion . " I was just telling him how you needed one . " Eloise looked at him quizzically . " Do lawyers come around now and knock on doors ? " He flushed.  | " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Dilworth , " he said , " it 's not what you think . I 'm not looking for business or anything like that . Truly . It 's just that I got sore when I heard what they 'd done to you , and  --  well  --  I wanted to tell you that I 'm on your side . " She continued to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Chapin , " she said finally . " I 'm glad you 're on my side . " " Eloise , you must listen to this young man . " She turned to her mother . " Very well , Irene . I will . But I think it might be as well if I did so alone , do n't you ? " Irene went to the sideboard , grumbling , and refilled her cocktail . " I 'm going , " she said , " do n't worry . All I want is to be sure you listen to him . " " I said I would , " Eloise assured her . " But do n't you , " she added with a smile . " Please ! " When she had closed the door behind Irene , she came back and sat in the chair where her mother had been sitting . " How is Hilda ? " she asked . " I have n't really been seeing her lately . She was pretty sore at me that time I took you all to Leo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that girl . But I thought she 'd forgiven you . Hilda can be very magnanimous . " He was afraid for a moment that she was being serious , and then she smiled . He laughed . " Well , the next time she saw me I was loaded , " he confessed . " Tough luck . It was at Al Herbert 's . I had no idea she 'd be there . " " I see . Well , that makes two of us she 's down on.  |p210There  's nothing , however , that I can do about my case . Yours , perhaps , is more hopeful . " " Hilda 's a pretty good girl , " he said awkwardly . " Fun-damentally . " " I think she is . Fundamentally . " " She 's awfully critical though . " " Very critical , " she agreed . He nodded . " Is that why you want to be my lawyer , Mr. Chapin ? " she asked mildly . " Do you think it would make Hilda less critical of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect . " " I agree with you . But that 's the point . I want to take issue with Hilda . I want her to see where I stand . " " And where is that ? " " Against people who behave the way your husband has behaved . " There was another rather heavy pause . " Do you really want to be my lawyer ? " she asked , gettingup and going to the sideboard to refill his drink . " I have no case , you know . I hate to ask anyone to represent me . " He shook his head to refuse the drink , and quite suddenly , without further discussion , there was a professional relationship between them . " I 've read the complaint , " he said . " I assume he can prove it ? " " Completely . " " You do n't want to oppose the divorce , then ? " " No . It 's just the children . " " Tell me about it . "  | " The children ? " " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down again and told him the story of her marriage . She was careful , he observed , to emphasize her own deficiencies as a wife and her husband 's good qualities . She assured him that George had never given her the least cause for jealousy , that he had been liberal with money and that he had been uniformly agreeable to all the people whom she cared about . There had been the exception , she admitted , of her mother , but Irene , she explained , had always been something of a problem . When she came to Carl she pointed out that few husbands would have toleratedsuch a friendship as long as he had . " I 'm sure your husband 's a wonderful man , Mrs. Dilworth , " he said at last . " But he has a lawyer already . I presume he does n't need another . " " Well , I want to be fair . " " If you really want to be fair , " he said slowly , keeping his eyes carefully on hers , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you tell me what sort of husband he 's really been ? Basically speaking ? " She looked puzzled for a moment and then suddenly flushed . " Irene ! " she exclaimed . " Has Irene been talking to you ? " " She says you told her . " " I never told her ! " she said indignantly . " Never ! She 's been snooping into things like that ever since she arrived . " " But it 's true ? " " What does it matter whether it 's true or not ? " she said impatiently . " Does it justify what I did ? "  | " It makes it more understandable , " he explained . " Judges are not always understanding , you know . " She appeared to think this over for a moment and then shuddered . " I could n't do a thing like that to George , Mr. Chapin . I really could n't . " " Why not ? Has he been so gentle with you ? " " But George is different , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pride is hurt . I ca n't hurt him any more than he has been . " " Even at the cost of losing your children ? " She jumped up and walked up and down the room , puffingnervously at her cigarette . He watched her in silence until she turned back to him , flinging the butt in the fireplace . " I see now that I 've been living in a dream , Mr. Chapin , " she said bitterly . " I was thinking that I 'd been liberated by my own misconduct . That I 'd been thrown out of a world I never really wanted to be in . I thought that once I 'd heard all the sneers and felt all the brickbats , it would have no more terrors for me . If I 'd paid the penalty , I could go my own way . " She shook her head . " But it 's not that way at all , is it ? Even the person who 's being thrown out never really gets out . The ones who belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same game according to the same degrading rules . As long as the world has any hold on you , and I guess it always does . Certainly as long as you 're a mother , anyway . " " The world is n't a very nice place , Mrs. Dilworth , " he agreed . " It 's proved that to you recently . But if I 'd been treated the way you 've been treated I 'd have no scruples.  |p213I  'd kick back and kick back hard . " She shook her head again , several times , almost impatiently . " But I do n't want revenge , Mr. Chapin . I do n't even feel the faintest desire for it . You do n't understand . " He looked at the unhappiness in her eyes and smiled in spite of himself . " If you 'll only look at the judge that way , Mrs. Dilworth , " he exclaimed , " our case is as good as won ! " IRENE WAS ALMOST satisfied with herself and with the world as she dressed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Irene rather did , it was certainly auspicious that at the very nadir of her and Eloise 's fortunesHilda Dilworth 's young man should detach himself from the enemy camp and come over to command their forces . Who could tell what wholesale desertions might not follow so striking an example ? She smiled at herself more cheerfully in the mirror as she rubbed rouge carefullyinto her pale cheeks . It was still going to be a fight , of course , but it was going to be a fight that they now had a chance of winning . Eloise might be surprised at her " they , " for Eloise still did n't trust her , but that was all right . Eloise could hardly be expected to appreciate thatp214under the brisk give and take of her gossip lay a maternal devotion all the stronger for not having been spent . Oh , true , she had given little evidence of it in the immediate past , but now things were different , as shown for example by her handling of Arthur Irwin . Arthur had been noticeablyput off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he regarded her , at her apartment , and for a time his little visits had been discontinued . And had she once reproached him ? She had not . She had simply waited until , lonely , he had sought to renew his visits , and she had then been careful to ignore his past defection . Mere visits , however , were not going to be enough . She had little use for Arthur Irwin , neutral , in a battle where she had made her plans for Arthur Irwin , ally . She knew how much their little dinners had come to mean to him and the dependencethat he was beginning to place on her sympatheticear . She knew how little he trusted his own children and how much he liked to complain to her about them . And she knew , most importantly of all , how hard it was for him to make new friends and how difficult it would be to find another like her . Of course , she had to face the fact , at the same time , that there was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extinction of any hope that she had of marrying him , but she had never been one to be afraid of a gamble . It was the element of chance , as a matter of fact , that gave the whole thing its excitement . When she heard the buzz of her doorbell and let him in , she thought he looked embarrassed . Even after they were seated and she had mixed him a cocktail , she noticed that he glanced occasionally towards the half-open door of her bedroom.  | " Arthur Irwin , will you kindly tell me who you expect to see coming out of my bedroom ? " He blushed . " I thought Eloise might be there . " " Eloise has the room across the corridor . Besides , she 's out for dinner . " " Oh . That 's just as well then . " " What do you mean , Arthur ? Why is it just as well ' ? " " I think that should be fairly obvious , Irene . " " You do ? I do n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Does being a friend of George 's , " she asked , looking him squarely in the eye , " involve standing behind him while he crucifies my child ? " " Oh , come now , Irene , " he protested , shaking his head at her , " I can understand that you feel that way . But George , after all , is my friend . Ca n't we drop it at that ? " " I 'm afraid we ca n't , Arthur , " she said in her gravest tone . " I want to know if you 're my friend , too . That 's something that happens to be very important to me . " He leaned forward a little in his chair and smiled at her . " I 'm glad it 's important to you , Irene . It 's important to me , too . Of course I 'm your friend . You ought to know that by now . " But she shook her head stubbornly . " I 'm not sure you can be a friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least not while this terrible thing is going on . I feel too strongly about it . I 'm sorry , but I do . There 's that poor child who 's done nothing all her life but try to please people . She has pampered George and the children and that smug Hilda and George 's fatuous old mother , to say nothing of my own brother and sister-in/law . " Irene was warmly authoritative now ; her eyes had a flash in them . " And what have they done for her in return ? Have any of them appreciated one jot or one tittle of it ? Not on your life . They 've sat there like a bunch of harpies , waiting for my poor angel to make a mistake , one single mistake , so they could all jump on her . They call that justice , but I know what I call it , Arthur ! I call it downright sadism ! " " But this mistake , as you describe it , Irene , was a pretty serious one . " Arthur was scratching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man should be able to put aside a wife who 's unfaithful to him . " " Put aside ! " she exclaimed . " Arthur Irwin , this is nineteen-forty-nine ! In a few months the twentieth century will be half over ! And this whole episode has been out of a play by Dumas Fils . " By raising her voice she was able to dodge any serious discussion of the moral issues involved . As a philosopher she knew that she would only alarm him . As an indignant mother she held his sympathy . " I know it 's been hard on you , Irene , " he said consolingly . " I know you 've suffered  --  " " But do you agree with George ? " she demanded , followingup her advantage . " Do you , Arthur Irwin , think those little girls should be taken away from a mother who adores them ? Who has looked after them day and night all their lives ? " " Well , that does seem extreme , I admit . " " But that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphantly . " And to accomplish what he wants he does n't hesitate to stigmatize her publicly as an adulteress.  |p217Did  I say Dumas Fils ? It 's pure Hawthorne . And did I say that he does n't hesitate to do it ? Why he goes at it with joy ! " " I do n't think that 's quite fair , Irene . I 've seen George , and he looks miserable . " " And so he ought ! And he 's going to be more miserable still when he sees how this thing boomerangs ! Mark my words , Arthur . You and George are going to find out that people wo n't put up with this sort of thing any more ! " " 1 and George ! " " Certainly you and George ! Did n't you tell me you were on his side ? " It turned out that Irene had gambled wisely indeed . Arthur Irwin had a set of rigid moral principles , and he had applied them strictly to his own children , barely speakingeven now to a daughter who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To his friends , however , when he saw fit , he reserved the privilege of applying different standards . Arthur had worked hard for his fortune ; he felt that he had earned the right to friends and tolerances to which his idler offspring were not entitled . He was also coming slowly to the conclusion that Irene , while not exactly indispensable to him  --  no one was really indispensable to Arthur  --  was perhaps irreplaceable . She had just the right feminine combination of familiarity and respect ; she made him feel important withoutletting him feel that he was pompous . She was interested in his money , of course , but would n't there have been something wrong with a woman of her age and situationwho was n't ? Besides , Arthur , who tended to equate his money with himself , was perfectly willing to be lovedp218for it . For any woman to ignore entirely the shining golden circle that he had drawn around himself might have seemed a kind of impertinence . Then it was also true that she had been married too much , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comfortable , isolationist feeling deep within him that things which had happened outside the country had somehow not really happened at all . But over and above all these considerations was the clear fact that his relationship with Irene , whatever he might ultimately decide to make of it , was certainly too valuable to be allowed to founder on an issue as remote as the custody of her grandchildren . Having once decided this , it was easy enough for him to take the next step and to speculate that , after all , she was probably right . A case like this one perhaps had better be settled . George , come to think of it , was going pretty far . It might be for the best all round if he dropped a hint to this effect to Gerald Hunt . It might even end the whole matter , and Irene would be pleasantly grateful . His opportunity to do this came the following week at a wedding reception given in the ballroom of a ladies ' club for the daughter of one of the Hunt &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irene and watched the young people dancing after the breaking up of the receiving line . Irene was looking very well in a black dress with a white , wide-brimmed hat . She seemed almost smug as she drank her champagne . " You see , Arthur , our side , Eloise 's side , I mean , is really beginning to get somewhere . Obviously the Athertons had to ask Gerald and Gladys , and that meant it would be awkwardto have George . But what about me ? They cer/tainly did n't have to have me , except they 're terrible old snoopers , and they know I 'm a friend of yours . So there you are . I 'm here , and George is n't . " She raised her glass in a mock toast . " Even Harry Hamilton would n't dare show his fat face . I tell you , Arthur , it 'll split the firm yet . " He laughed . It was a short , dry laugh . " If you have anything to do with it , it will , Irene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurt it , " she continued , looking around her critically . " Do they have to ask all the clients every time one of their children gets married ? I never saw such dowdy women . Do you suppose they take courses in school to learn how to look that dowdy ? " " Well , do n't worry . You 'll never look like that , Irene . " " I suppose they ca n't help it , poor things , " she continued , mollified , shaking her head . " That 's the trouble with American business . From a wife 's point of view , I mean . It takes twenty years to get anywhere , and then what good does it do them ? " " Money can be spent on other things besides personal adornment , " he reproved her . " And . what about your sister-in-law ? She did n't have to wait twenty years . " They both looked over to where Gladys Hunt , serene under a pancake green hat , oddly floating over her billowingpompadour of grey hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger women . " No , you 're right , " Irene agreed . " There 's no excuse for Gladys . No explanation for her , either . A big frog , I suppose . But oh , Arthur , what a puddle ! " " Why do n't you go and talk to Gladys a minute ? I 've something I want to discuss with Gerald . "  | " Business ? Even at weddings ? " " What 's wrong with weddings ? " Irene shrugged her shoulders and went over to Gladys . Arthur smiled as he saw them peck at each other 's cheek . Yet he was almost proud of Irene as he watched her ; she was easily , despite her age , the most striking woman in the room . He would have been perfectly pleased to point her out as his wife and a man as distinguished-looking as Gerald as his brother-in-law . Of course , he was much too successful now and too old to have anything further to gain by a family connection with Gerald Hunt , but there had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal about it . It was rather gratifying now , after all the hard years , to think that he might be about to acquire a group of Hunt relations for no reason more snobbish than his enjoyment of the martinis and conversation of a battered old girl who had no money to bring him and less reputation . And how they would jump to make up to her then ! Oh , of course , it would be only another reminder of how far he had come in life , but multitudinous as such reminders now were , they still had their pleasant side . Then he remembered his mission and turned to look for Gerald . He found him holding forth to a group of young lawyers who were grouped respectfully around him . He raised one arm as Arthur approached . " Aha , the distinguished Mr. Irwin . Boys , you know Mr. Irwin . " Arthur nodded to the circle of heads . He knew perfectlywell that Gerald had no more idea of their names than he did , probably less , for he , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had worked for him.  | " Could I have a word with you , Gerald ? " " My dear fellow , of course . " The circle of young men promptly broke up , and they were left alone . " I know it 's a painful subject , and I mention it as a friend of Irene 's rather than as a client of yours . It 's this suit George is bringing . " Gerald put his hands behind his back and assumed his most serious aspect . He formed his lips into a circle and breathed in through his mouth . " Bad business , Arthur . Very bad business . Nobody feels worse about it than I do . Terrible . " He shook his head . " Terrible . " " I wondered if you could n't call George off . Settle the thing out of court . " Gerald looked at him with a rather exaggerated expression of surprise . " My dear Arthur , you do n't think for a minute I have n't done everything I could , do you ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't listen to me . He and Hamilton have got the bit in their teeth , and there 's no stopping them . " Arthur looked grave . He saw suddenly from the expression in Gerald 's eyes what was expected of him , and it was a good deal more than he had been prepared to give . " Nothing doing , eh ? " " Nothing . " For several moments he looked blankly at Gerald withoutspeaking . Anger was growing inside him , accelerating , shifting rapidly in its search for a victim , from Irene for getting him into this , to Gerald for wanting what he wanted , to Eloise for being such a tramp and finally top222George for having started the damn suit in the first place . But Arthur made up his mind quickly , and George was the last on his list . George was going to have to give up the lawsuit ; it was as simple as that . And it was nobody 's fault but George 's own . He should have anticipated that Gerald would request the reassurance that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . George might be his idea of all a lawyer should be , but Gerald Hunt was not the kind of general counsel with whom one parted company over an issue like this . " I would have thought you might have been in a position to exercise some pressure , Gerald , " he said more sharply . " After all , Eloise is your niece . " Gerald shrugged his shoulders . He managed to express in this gesture the understanding hopelessness of a man of the world who still has a heart . " What pressure , Arthur ? I intend to watch the case , of course . It still may be possible to keep it out of the papers . " " You know the kind of pressure I mean . " " My dear Arthur , " Gerald said again blandly , " I can do a lot of things . You and I both know that . But I have to know where I stand . The case is about to go to trial . Nothingunder the sun will keep George from bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may do well to leave it . But if it is n't , if it starts to become a public scandal , I should like to use very strong measures indeed and to use them speedily . I am delighted you agree , but let me ask you just one question . You mentioned just now that you were my client . Does that mean mine and no one else 's ? " Gerald 's tone became very dry indeed as he put hisp223question , and he stared with none of his usual suaveness at Arthur as he finished . It was business , and he meant business ; he was enough of a diplomat to know that although there was a place for smoothness , vital issues still had to be underscored . Arthur breathed heavily for a moment and then drew a cigar from his vest pocket . " It means just that , " he said , chewing off the tip . " You can count on it , Gerald . " " Thank you , " said Gerald , nodding his head immediatelyand resuming his old manner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , my dear Judge , " he said , turning to a white-haired man who was bearing down on them , " I 'm delighted to see you . You remember Mr. Irwin , do n't you ? With your customary wisdom , if I recall correctly , you ruled in his favor in that special dividend case last year . Let me see , how was it called ? Irwin against the People 's National Bank  --  ? " THERE WERE NOT many people in the courtroom early on the damp winter Friday morning when Dilworth vs . Dilworth was called , but as Hilda , sitting in a back row , reflected bitterly , there were a good many more than a routine divorce case would have called out . The group of men in the first row to the left were obviously reporters ,  |p224and  if there was even one of these , might there not as well be a dozen ? Hilda felt cold and wretched , though she had kept her coat on and the room was warm ; she looked up over the clean white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond , as if searching for some symbol of the redeemability of herself and the little people in the far end of the room who sat behind the bar , of Judge Cory , so old and blinking and testy behind his pince-nez , even of her father , stiff and expressionless at his table . She had come because she had to learn these things . They happened . It was life . There was a man on the witness stand ; she could n't hear what he was saying , but she saw that he had a photograph in his hand . It was handed up to the judge who simply glanced at it and grunted . Then she saw Bobbieget up and heard him say something very fast that apparently was an objection . Nobody seemed to pay much attention to him , nor did he seem to mind ; their voices were distant and unconcerned , like those of actors engaged in a line rehearsal where gesture and expression are superfluous . Her father had briefed her on what was going to happen . There was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The plaintiff 's case was now opening with proof of what had happened in Landik 's apartment . Soon , perhaps in a half-hour , Mr. Hamilton would examine Eloise on the question of parental fitness . She made herself turn and look at Eloise and saw that , just as she had pictured her beforehand , Eloise was pale and beautiful . She was looking directly at Hilda now , but she turned her head immediatelywithout even a nod of recognition . Of course , Eloise would never presume that they could still be friends . Shep225would not take it for granted that people could forgive . And Hilda , watching Bobbie as he sat beside her stepmother , whispering to her , wondered sadly what was left for herself but a preoccupied father and the atmosphere of rather tired justice that filled the room like solid cubic blocks , justice that was one 's own for the asking and that no one but Dilworths seemed to want . She had not seen people or done things , she had not even felt capable of attendingher business-school courses since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her suddenly , with an unpleasant mixture of alarm and suspicion , if she knew that Bobbie Chapin was representing Eloise . It had been the first time she had heard of it , and her appalledexpression had reassured him as to any part in the strange affair that she might have played . There had been nothing , however , to reassure herself . At first she had been simply , if violently , jealous , but little by little her jealousy had given way to a sensation that she could only describe as envy , a strange envy of the unexpected congeniality that she assumed now to exist between Eloise and Bobbie , of the undoubted harmony of their points of view , of the pleasant , joking time , even in Eloise 's trouble , that they might be having together . And with the birth of this envy came a sudden , shocking impulse to surrender to them , to fling everything she believed in to the winds and rush pell-mell across the field of contest that divided her from them , in front of gaping crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senseless apology , before the grandstand of their basic good will . For Eloise alone she could fight , or even Bobbie , but this alliance , so odd , so utterly inexplicable , seemed to threaten the whole jerry/built structure of her sense of honor , filling its dusty emptinesswith noise and wind . She found herself perversely anxious to exult in her own defeat , in her own agonizing exclusion from the shared warmth of their friendship . She closed her eyes and shook her head in the courtroom as she actually caught herself praying that Eloise would lose her case so that she might still befriend her with magnanimity . George Dilworth had his arms folded across his chest , and he stared straight ahead at the railing of the empty jury box as he listened to the testimony of the detective . Just once he glanced out of the corner of his eye at where Eloise was sitting . She did not look at him , for she was looking at the witness , her features set with contempt . It was the first time that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to give up Landik , but her expression was just as he had imagined it , one of bold , even defiant independence . If she had only come to him after her interview with Harry and asked his forgiveness , if she had even once , just once , tried to see him , things might have been different . But no . His first suspicions had been correct ; she hated him for not giving her what she no longer wanted of him . She had ceased , in a word , to be his . And when he thought of what the little girls had said to Judge Cory in his chambers , how they had held out stubbornly to be with their mother , his anger seemed to freeze into something more like fear . For it was not only that she would carry on an affair under his very nose , she would take his children , she would happily , in fact , rip to pieces the very way of life that it had taken him so many years to build up . She might even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his downtown world against him , andp227for what ? For defending his honor , his home ? He put his hand over his eyes and thought of the beating of his heart . Surely it was too fast . Surely it would never do to go on with this excitement . Then some of the words of the testimonycame to him , and he felt a quiver of even sharper alarm . Was n't Harry going too far ? He had a vision of Gerald and the other partners gathering against him ; on all sides he began to see puckered brows and shaking heads  --  oh , hurry up , Harry , he groaned inwardly , hurry up and put that bitch where she belongs , make it irrevocable , get it over with , but hurry  --  The law , however , was not to be hurried , nor was Harry Hamilton . He enjoyed litigation , and this case he was enjoyingparticularly . He strutted back and forth before the witness stand , the large photographs in his hand , held slightly away from him as if to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton , if the defense has no objection , " Judge Cory intervened , " we have enough evidence of this unsavory episode . " " Very well , your Honor . " He nodded to Bobbie with a slight shrug of his shoulders . " Your witness . " " No questions . " Bobbie sat down again , impassive . " Remember what I told you , " he whispered to Eloise . " You can make a fool of Fatty if you want . He 's wide open . But do n't let him get you mad . " She nodded . " I mean it , " he repeated . " It 's vital . " Then he suddenly smiled . " Have you seen Hilda ? She looks like a stuffed prune . Poor kid . She did n't bargain for anything likep228this . How about you ? Holding up ? " " I do n't know . It 's like a dream . I ca n't believe those men can be sitting there saying what they 're saying . Right in public . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hilda 's direction . He was right . She did look terrible . And why not ? To have deifieda father and to have one 's god behave this way  --  well , would it cure her ? She looked at George and shook her head sadly at the sight of his dark countenance . It was true , and for the first time she could really see it , that what they were doing to themselves was worse than what they were doing to her . She felt Bobbie 's hand on her arm . " Here you go . " She walked , feeling numb , to the witness chair , raised her hand and took the oath . Then she turned to face Harry Hamilton . He was at his most seemingly indifferent , his stomach forward , his thumb and forefinger in his usual gesture of rubbing his eyeballs . " Mrs. Dilworth , " he began in a rather weary voice , " you do not deny , I take it , that you committed adultery with one Carl Landik on the date and under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on his feet . " Objection , your Honor . There 's no reason why Mrs. Dilworth should be asked to incriminate herself ! " " Overruled , " Judge Cory answered immediately . " The question is proper . But is there any need for it , Mr. Hamilton ? " he continued , turning to Harry . " Has n't there been sufficient proof already of what you allege ? "  |p229Harry  nodded several times , in a quick , offhand manner . " I had thought the facts virtually conceded , " he said airily . " But no matter . If Mr. Chapin wishes my questions to be hypothetical , I can ' certainly accommodate him . Let me start , then , if I may , by reading aloud to Mrs. Dilworth and to the court an excerpt from the opinion of Judge Vane in the case of Mason against Mason , Appellate Division , First Department , decided in nineteen-twenty-four . " He cleared his throat and reached behind him , without even glancing around , for the volume which Tom Haighter promptly placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Parenthood , ' Judge Vane states , ' is the highest avocation to which a man or a woman can be called . The rearing and education of our youth are the foundation stones upon which our republic is built . Nor is anything more vital to the educational process than the teaching of proper moral standards where relations between the sexes are involved . Any parent who is unable or unwilling to undertake such indoctrination must be unfit to have charge of the educationof minors . ' " He turned abruptly to Eloise . " Would you agree with Judge Vane 's point of view , Mrs. Dil-worth ? " Bobbie was again on his feet . " I object , your Honor . The question calls for the witness ' opinion on matters that are not only vague but beyond the scope of this action . " " Your Honor ! " Harry protested in a now thundering tone . " It is essential that the court know a parent 's point of view on moral issues ! " " Objection overruled . " Harry turned again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Dilworth ? " " It 's a very general statement , " she answered , looking at the judge as if he could not help but agree with her , " but I suppose I could say that I agree with it in principle . Yes . " She nodded her head as she said " yes , " feeling sick as she did so . She looked for reassurance at Bobbie . He winked , and she was grateful to him , but she could n't help reflecting that he did not really feel as she did . To him it was part of the game . " Let me impose upon the court 's time , " Harry continuedwith a nod to the bench , " with a further quotation from the same learned justice , this time in nineteen-twentysevenin the case of Pines against Pines . He speaks here of the evils of fornication and adultery . Fornication , as perhaps I should explain , " he continued , turning to Eloise with crinkled nostrils , " is sexual intercourse between two persons not married to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , that is , not fornicating with him or her at the time  --  such married fornicator is also guilty of the crime of adultery . I trust I make myself clear . " " Your Honor , " Bobbie protested furiously , jumping to his feet , " Mr. Hamilton is insulting the witness ! I request that he be directed to moderate his language ! " Judge Cory nodded his head briefly . " I wish , Mr. Hamilton , that you would use as few offensivewords as possible . " Harry bowed to the bench . " I shall do my best , your Honor . I assure you they are as distasteful to me as they are to you . The subject is not of my choosing . " He turned back to his book andp231cleared his throat again . " No act threatens the home , the basic rock of our society , more dangerously than the act of adultery . That an adulteress could be a fit person in whose hands to place the rearing of young and innocent persons is almost unthinkable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only if the court has reason to believe that she has seen the error of her ways and will not continue her adulteries in the future , should she be considered a fit guardian for her children . ' " Harry closed the book impressively . " May I ask you , Mrs. Dilworth , whether you agree with Judge Vane 's opinion in the passage that I have just finished reading ? " Eloise stared with a cold dismay into those large , watery eyes . She tried to keep her mind on Peggy and Jo and what this would mean to them , but it was no use . Harry was still in front of her , superior and sneering , trying , of course , to be as superior and sneering as he could , to exasperateher . Yet the only thing in the world that seemed to matter at all was that she should repudiate him , refute him , even if her repudiation and refutation were exactly what he was seeking . Do you want to be a martyr , she whispered warningly to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only that , not really that at all  --  " Shall I reread the quotation to you , Mrs. Dilworth ? " She shook her head . " You need n't . I understand it . Judge Vane thinks that adultery is wrong . And so it may be . But I do n't think it need necessarily be as wrong as that . " She caught a glimpse of Bobbie 's warning eyes and turned her face away . " Really , Mrs. Dilworth ? " Harry queried , assumingp232again his bored tone , yet scarcely able to conceal a little quiver of excitement . " Perhaps you would tell us just how wrong you think it is ? " " I think it depends , " she answered slowly . " If it 's committedall the time , indiscriminately , promiscuously , then I suppose it 's wrong . " " I see , " came back the voice , now on a rising note of triumph . " But if it 's committed from time to time , discriminately , unpromiscuously . . . " Here Harry rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably , it 's all right ? " " No , I do n't mean that . It all depends . " " What does it depend on , Mrs. Dilworth ? " he demanded in a strong , stern voice , but she did n't answer because she could think of nothing to say . " Perhaps I can help you , " he continued more quietly . He placed his hands behind his back and gazed reflectively up at the ceiling . " Shall we break it down ? Let us take your phrase from time to time . ' Would you say once a month was all right ? Once a fortnight ? Once a week perhaps ? Provided , of course , one was discriminating and unpromiscuous ? " " Well , of course , it ca n't be reduced to numbers , " she said impatiently . " I 'm only trying to draw a distinction between the woman whose attitude is serious and the woman whose attitude is not . I can imagine a woman whose husband has neglected her , for example , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , if they 're discreet  --  " " But suppose the husband has not neglected her ? " Harry interrupted , almost with a roar . " Suppose he has worked hard and long to support her and the children ? Supposep233he has never so much as looked at another woman ? Could adultery be justified under those circumstances , Mrs. Dil-worth ? " " I do n't know , " she said , suddenly weary of it . " I supposeeach case must be judged according to its own merits . " " Then there are no absolute standards ? " " How can I tell ? " she protested . " Anyone can be made to look foolish in a discussion like this . You know that as well as I , Mr. Hamilton . " She looked up at him as he drew himself formidably up to his full heght to retort . She felt a curious exhilaration , not unlike what she had felt after the first shock of the scene at Carl 's apartment , a sense , again , that the worst had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently , like adultery and fornication , words that she had never heard used this way by people to each other , certainlynever in public , had suddenly lost their terror . They seemed like so many Easter bunnies and Teddy ' bears scatteredaround the courtroom for other children to pick up and fondle . It was a nursery , and full of horrid children , but she at least was an adult . " I 'm not trying to make you look foolish , Mrs. Dilworth , " Harry was saying now with the utmost gravity . " I 'm merely trying to determine if you have a moral code and , if so , what it amounts to . It is unfortunately necessary to determine this where the custody of children is involved . If you believe that adultery is only occasionally wrong , will you not bring up your daughters to think as you do ? " " Oh , no ! "  | " Adultery , then , will be wrong for them but right for you ? " " Objection , your Honor . " Bobbie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dilworth never said adultery was right for her . " " I amend the question , " Harry said blandly , rolling his eyes again to the judge as though in mutual recognition of the delays that had to be conceded to this impatient young man . " Does it not follow , Mrs. Dilworth , from what you have just said , that you would have one moral code for your children and another for yourself ? " " Not exactly , " she replied , flustered between her effort to concentrate and her sense of the absurdity of the discussion . " But there are things that an adult  --  and I mean by an adult a person who is mature in every way  --  can do without injury to herself that a younger person ca n't do . " " Such things as adultery ? " " Yes . Perhaps even adultery . " " At what age , in your opinion , " he sneered , " does a person become free to commit adultery ? " " Free ? I never said free . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , can a woman commit adultery without harm to herself ? " She sighed . " There 's no set age , Mr. Hamilton , " she protested . " That 's ridiculous . It depends on her maturity and the cir-cumstances . " " You would , then , teach your daughters that marriage vows are only binding until maturity has been attained ? " " Oh , no . I would want my daughters to be married happily . Very happily . "  | " But if they were not , " he pursued rapidly , " you would tell them that adultery can be a morally justifiable remedy ? Under certain circumstances , of course ? " " Those things they would have to find out for themselves , Mr. Hamilton . I did n't invent adultery . " " None of us invented evil or temptation , Mrs. Dilworth , " Harry thundered . " What we invent , or should invent , is the moral armament to use against them . I fail to see how your children can be expected to develop such armament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral code is treated as a mere matter of circumstance . Can you explain how they will , Mrs. Dilworth ? " " I do n't think I would discuss such a thing as adultery with children , Mr. Hamilton . " " But children ask questions . They hear things at school , and it 's only natural that they should turn to a parent as an authority . Your children may hear of this case , Mrs. Dilworth . What will you tell them ? " Eloise paused , breathless for a moment at the violence of this attack . She felt an impulse of sympathy towards her in the air of the courtroom , but when she looked at the judge , he only looked away . " I think I would tell them that they 'd understand when they were older , " she said quietly . " Meaning that by that time they would have learned which adulteries were right and which were wrong ? " " No , " she said firmly . " Meaning that at that time they would be able to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And does that not boil down to saying that you would refuse them moral guidance ? " " As to problems that may come up in the future whichp236cannot now be visualized , yes . " Harry turned abruptly to Bobbie . " Your witness , " he said . She hardly dared to face Bobbie as he got up and walked over slowly to the witness chair . He did not , however , look reproachful . He looked tired , but she thought again that he gave her the suggestion of a wink . " Mrs. Dilworth , " he began in a quiet , sympathetic tone , " you have told me that the incident which has been demonstratedearlier today was the first time that you had ever been unfaithful to your husband . Is that true ? " " It is . " " How long have you been married , Mrs. Dilworth ? " " Thirteen years . " " Thirteen years . " He nodded gravely . " I see . Now my next question , I 'm afraid , is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court just what your relations with Mr. Dilworth have been during the past five years ? " She stared very hard into his light blue eyes until the courtroom seemed to recede into a dullness . Then her vision blurred and when it cleared she saw surprise in his eyes and then concern . " Yes , Bobbie . I do mind , " she said distinctly . " I mind very much . " He turned immediately to Judge Cory . " Your Honor , I would like to ask for a recess . I 'm sorry to do this , but I think my client is upset . I 'm sure you will understand when you consider what she has been through today . Mrs. Dilworth is not a lady who 's accustomed to hearing the kind of language that Mr. Hamilton has exposed her to . "  | " We 'll adjourn till Monday at ten , if you like , " the judge conceded . " Unless Mr. Hamilton has any objec-tion . " " No objection , your Honor . But I would like to emphasizeagain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes such exception was the fruit of the defendant'sown conduct and not of my invention . " Eloise rejoined Bobbie at counsel 's table and then rose with the others as the judge left the courtroom . She saw Hilda slip out the door ahead of the onlookers , and from the corner of one eye she saw George talking to Harry who was putting papers in his briefcase and nodding his head . " Come , " Bobbie said to her . " I 'll buy you a drink and some lunch . " " Oh , Bobbie , you do n't have to . Poor Bobbie . " " Come . " He took her to a bar across the square from the court house and said nothing until they each had a drink before them . " Drink , " he said . Obediently , she raised the glass to her lips . " You know , " he said , " I had a sort of suspicion that you 'd do that . I never really believed that you 'd let me handle this case as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , Bobbie ? " " I 'd like to be . I 'll tell you that . " He took a long sip of his cocktail and then managed a smile . " You certainly made an ass of me today , Eloise . But I kept reminding myself that I was the one who had asked for it . You never came to me . I pushed myself on you . And why the hell did I ? Can you tell me ? "  | " You wanted to make Hilda angry . " " Did I ? That was part of it , I guess . " His smile becamerather sour . " She 'll probably marry me now . Now that your case is all mucked up . I 've probably won my way into her dark little heart at last . " " Oh , Bobbie , I 'm sorry . Ca n't I tell people I went against your advice ? Or do something to exonerate you ? I seem to make such a mess of things . " " You do , Eloise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You sure do . You 're too honest for this world . That 's your trouble . Look . You 're going to lose custody of those kids . Sure as shooting . You wo n't get a nickel out of George . You 'll be all over the papers in the morning . But it 'll be worth it to you . And why , in the name of God ? Because you want to be the champion of adultery ? Is that such a great thing ? " She knew how it was going to hurt later on , what he said and the truth of it , she knew how grim it would be when she got back to the Stafford and thought of Peggy and Jo with no one to read to them but old Mrs. Dilworthor George himself , in his literal , uncomprehending way . But now she could still feel and cling to the remnantsof exhilaration . " It 's not that , Bobbie , " she protested . " You 're talking like Harry . It 's just that I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their meaningless , last-centuryformulas , conceived in hate and designed to inflict pain . I wo n't do it , Bobbie ! And I wo n't tell them either , about George 's  --  " " Impotence . " " Call it what you will . Let George wash his dirty linen in public . I sha n't wash mine . "  |p239He  snorted . " Too much of a lady . " " All right , too much of a lady ! " she agreed excitedly . " I do n't care what you call it . I know how George has sunk , and I wo n't sink to his level . I 've talked their formulasall my life . Is n't that enough ? Now I 've washed my mouth out . And I intend to keep it clean ! " " Eloise . " He shook his head sadly as he said her name . " Eloise , you 're beyond me . You 've brought back the past , do n't you see ? Anyone who heard Harry Hamilton this morning would have thought we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with you . They do . They 're on your side . But you force them to go against you . Judge Cory wants to rule in your favor , I know . He talked to those kids . Anyone can see they 're crazy about their mother  --  " " Oh , Bobbie , please  --  " " No , Eloise , I 've got to say it . All you have to do is behave yourself in court to have things the way they ought to be and the way everybody but George and that sonof-a-bitch , Hamilton , really wants them . But no . You wo n't have it that way . You want to use the trial as a sounding board for a lot of ideas that you do n't even believe in . For God 's sake , be practical ! Win your case and then do anything you want . Write a book if you must . But not here . Not in court . " She shook her head several times . In the silence of their booth , without the hateful booming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , but she wondered if she could ever articulate it . " Maybe it is foolish , " she conceded . " But when Harry started asking me those questions I knew that I had to tellp240the truth . No matter what happened . It was as if I 'd been living in a moral void ever since what happened with Carl . All my life before then I 'd been living by what I thought was a code , and maybe it was one  --  I do n't know  --  but it was n't mine , that 's the point . It was other people 's . When I stopped being quite so afraid of other people , it seemed foolish to go on being quite so afraid of their code . Oh , Bobbie , do n't you see it ? I had to be on my own . And , of course , I make mistakes . But that does n't mean I have to go home again with my tail between my legs . I have to find out the things 1 think are right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through myself , that what Harry and George are doing to me is wrong . We do n't all have the luck , Bobbie , of finding great moral issues . Some of us have to make asses of ourselves over little ones . " " Here , here ! " " But we have to start somewhere , Bobbie . That 's the point . And I 've made my start . " " You 've started all right . Right at the bottom . " " I 'm sorry , Bobbie , " she said disconsolately . " I 'm sorry for what I 've done to you . I hope we can still be friends . " " Oh , we 'll be friends , " he said , signaling the waiter for two more cocktails . " We 'll even drink to that . Because I like you , Eloise . But you 're an exasperating client . You 're almost as exasperating as that stepdaughter of yours . " " Ex-stepdaughter . " He laughed . " Not yet . Not for a few days anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custody , Eloise . She 's thep241one who needs a few new ideas . " He scratched his head and then asked for the second time : " Why did I ever have to get mixed up with your family , anyway ? Will you tell me that ? " THE FIRST DAY of the case of Dilworth against Dilworthfell on a Friday , and on Saturday morning the publicity which the newspapers accorded it exceeded even Gerald Hunt 's worst fears . There were pictures of Eloise , of George and of Carl ; there was even one headlinethat ran : " Wife of prominent attorney defends own adultery , " and the testimony was reported in salacious extracts . The public reaction was various , particularly in that part of the city where the name of Hunt &; Livermore was a familiar one . There were a certain number of fierce old maids , living on their memories of other people 's memories , and of conservative elderly bachelors with repressed homosexual inclinations who were elated to see a beautiful woman publicly exposed and humiliated . Then there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the case but the quoted excerpts of testimony and who assumed , with more curiosity than condemnation , and with some surprise on the part of those who actually knew Eloise , that this quiet and gentle woman had burstp242the bonds of her repression to become the flaming advocate of unfettered love . But there was also , and particularly among the better informed of the downtown bar , a group of prominent citizens who were deeply shocked that George Dilworth should seek so public and scandalous a redress even for what they conceded was a serious wrong . It was the attitude of this group that even if the legal standards of parental morality operated harshly in individualcases , it would be difficult to broaden them without danger of destroying altogether such rules of conduct as were still believed in . There were rights and wrongs , in other words , in a general sense , and for somebody , particularlysomebody in the position of George Dilworth , to allow his personal pique to induce him so to tamper with the precarious setup as to make justice seem tyrannical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , was Reno for but to keep the delinquencies of the respectable from prying eyes ? In Reno , that innocuoussource of a million newspaper stories , adultery becameincompatibility ; desertion , hurt feelings , and impotencethe persistent failure to support one 's partner 's suit at the bridge table . It was to this enchanted city with its fairy-tale interpretation of facts that everyone recognizedbut that nobody wished to face that George should have taken his wounded pride . Carl Landik spent Friday and Saturday in sullen solitude . He had not been called as a witness in the case as Harry Hamilton had not needed him , but he had refused to go out of town which might have had the look of running away . He had felt it his duty to be on hand and ready to help Eloise whenever she should need him , andp243he had called on Bobbie Chapin at his office to tell him this . Bobbie had been very nice about it , and Carl had felt for him the immediate liking which the intellectual often feels for the man of affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostility to the world of the imagination . But Bobbie had had the same answer for him that Eloise had had . " I can imagine what you 're going through , fella , " he had said , putting his hand on Carl 's shoulder as he conductedhim to the lobby . " But you 're just a fifth wheel in this case . If I were you , I 'd duck out of town . Leave me your address . I 'll get hold of you if I need you . " " Thanks , Chapin . You 're okay . But I 'll be at my same address . The one I gave you . " On Saturday morning he read the papers and felt too sick to do anything but sit in his apartment and mope . After two anonymous and abusive calls and several others from reporters , he had his telephone disconnected . He could only indulge in the rather grim satisfaction of repeatingover and over to himself that his chance to help her was not now but later , that he would make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prospect that he faced withoutcheerfulness and sometimes , when he thought of the impetuosity of his proposal , with active resentment . For he had never really wanted to marry Eloise . He did n't really want to marry anyone , not for years anyway . He reflected with the gloomiest feelings how difficult if not impossible it would be to fit her into his life and among his friends , how patient but long suffering she would be at their drinkingparties , what a struggle it might be to support her . He pictured already the patently brave , falsely cheerfulp244resignation with which she would face his discovered in fidelities , a resignation that he would never be able to criticize because he would know that it came from gratitude . Christ , what would she say if she knew that all duringthe period of their strange friendship and on the very day before her visit to his apartment , he had been living with that neurotic girl painter on the floor above ? Oh , she would say nothing , she would never complain , she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but if only they could go back to their original basis , to the mild grey uncommitting coolness of their autumn walks ! This rest was madness . By evening he was so miserable that he had to see someone , and he called on Lorna , though he well knew she would be enjoying the newspapers to the hilt . She was , however , the only friend he had who knew both him and Eloise , and she was gratifyingly glad to see him , pouring him several stiff drinks , one after the other . It was only after the third double scotch that he would say anything at all about Eloise . " If I could only think she 'd let me make this up to her , " he said moodily , to plumb her reaction . " If I could only think she 'd marry me , I 'd feel better about it . But there she is , all alone , with her life ruined . And whose fault is it but mine ? " " Carl , really . I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely Victorian . " " Everyone else seems to be . " " Have you asked her to marry you ? " " Of course I have ! " " Well , do n't jump at me . " She sat back in her chair with her hands raised as if in self-defense . " Let me ask a simple question . Are you in love ? "  | " Certainly . " " And she refused you ? " He looked at her gloomily . " She implied that what 's happened is no reason for getting married . " Lorna , for once in her life , looked impressed . " Did she really ? Well , she 's right , of course . Even you , Carl , will come to see that . In time . " He turned away from her and finished his drink in a gulp . He hated himself for having sought the reassurance that Eloise would refuse him . " Your trouble , Carl , " Lorna said in a kinder tone , " is that you want to pay . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but come out of it unscathed . That 's what you have to face , my friend . In a way , it 's harder on you than anyone . " Irene had been in a state of nerves on Friday night . Eloise had gone out to dinner with Bobbie ; they had asked her to go with them , but she had refused , saying that she would stay in her room and nurse a sick headache . She saw all in ruins because of Eloise 's perversity , but for once in her life she felt too low even to remonstrate . It was thus that Arthur Irwin found her when he called , stretched out on the sofa with an ice pack on her head and a whiskey and soda in her hand . " I 'm sorry , Arthur , " she said wearily , " I 'm too done in to dress up . You 'll just have to take me as I am . " She could not have said anything that would have appealed to him more . To be accepted entirely as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and revered as a potentate , was what he most desired . They talked about the case and Eloise 's testimony , which had horrified him ,  |p246but  Irene , even in her state of emotional upheaval , never allowed herself to be caught in the pros and cons of the point of view which her daughter had expressed in court . She confined herself to what her " poor girl " was going through and reiterated , again and again , that Eloise had been too upset and hounded by " that fiend , " Harry Hamilton , to have known what she was saying . Towards the end of the evening , when she threw up her hands and asked rhetorically what was going to happen to them now , he gravely made his long expected proposal . " I think , Irene , that the time has come when I might be allowed to take a hand in your affairs . If I say so myselfyou would probably find several of your problems solved by the simple expedient of becoming Mrs. Irwin . At any rate , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him for several moments with her eyes wide open . Then the ice pack fell from her head , the drink from her hand , and she sat up and flung her arms around his neck with an almost perfect simulation of surprise and spontaneity . " Arthur ! You mean you feel that way , too ! " And after he had gone to the telephone to order a bottle of champagne she straightened her hair and reflected elatedlythat she was still adhering to her resolution of trying once again to be a good mother . Was she not , after all , placing a fortune at her child 's disposal ? Gerald Hunt had the most direct reaction to the turn which the case had taken . He received reports on Friday afternoon which made him realize that George had in fact crossed the Rubicon , and a glance at the papers the next morning assured him that swift action was necessary . Gerald , for all his diplomacy , could be very swift whenp247he felt the future of the firm to be at stake . There were hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and trusted clients , including Arthur Irwin . The latter gave him an astounding piece of family news that strengthened his hand immeasurably and made the contemplated action now almost imperative . His last calls were to George and Harry to request them to be at his house at noon . They met , the three of them , at the appointed hour in Gerald 's dark Italian renaissance den at the back of the ground floor of his city house . " I am sorry to bring you here on a weekend , gentlemen , " Gerald began in his gravest tone , the one he reserved for his rare appearances in the federal appellate courts . " But I consider it a matter of the utmost importance to us all . You knew my concern about your case , George , with particular regard to the reputation of the firm . My concern , you will admit , has been justified . I find myself in an intolerable position . All New York is accusing me of standing by while two of my partners destroy my niece . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George said sullenly , " that it 's your niece who 's causing the scandal . Not I. " " I do n't wish to go into that , George , " Gerald retorted , slightly raising his voice . " Any more than I care to go into the ridiculous issues that Harry has raised in court . The point is that a scandal has started and that as your wife 's uncle as well as your partner my position is untenable . You will remember that when I first discussed this unhappy matter with you , you offered to resign from the firm if I thought it proper . " " I did . "  | " I had no idea then , of course , of taking you up on it . You 're one of our ablest partners , and the matter , after all , was personal . But now the situation has changed . The matter has become regrettably public . Clients have been shocked by Harry 's aggressiveness . There is only one thing I can do . " Gerald paused deliberately and arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper cutter . " I do not like to be in the position of giving ultimatums , but if I must , I must . I tell you , frankly , George , that unless you withdraw or settle this suit on Monday morning and proceed with your divorce in a less sensationalfashion , I shall feel obliged to accept your offer of resignation . I might add that I have not come to this painfuldecision without the backing of a proper number of our senior partners . " George , breathing heavily , sat for several moments in silence , staring at the bland features of this older man who had for twenty years preserved a position of dominance in his life . It seemed indeed odd that after so long and arduous a struggle on his own part to gain the peak , he should now be releasing his grip from the very topmost boulder to slide back down the slope before Gerald 's mildly curious eyes . And the oddness of it , he saw now with a dazed clarity , was the extent to which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer escape , because the act of articulating submission to Gerald 's terms had become impossible , not for reasons of pride or even , any more , of revenge , but simply and arbitrarily because it was impossible , because he knew , with a gloomy prognostication , that he was not going to submit . " All right , Gerald , " he said slowly , " I resign . We can work out the details next week . "  | " You 're sure , George ? You do n't want the weekend to think it over ? " " I 'm sure , Gerald . " There was a painful pause . " I suppose you think I 'm being unfair . " " You suppose correctly . I see no reason to discuss it . " Harry Hamilton rolled his anxious eyes from one to the other of these stubborn men . He no longer felt stubbornhimself . He had been shaken by his duel with Eloise and by the bright , glittering hostility in her eyes as she had proceeded , with the defiance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to walk into his . He had been shaken by the attitude of the other lawyers in the firm who felt that he had been rough , even brutal with a helpless woman . Harry had not been prepared for antagonism ; under his burly and bristling exterior he craved , even more than most , the affection and approval of those around him . He could have borne it , however ; he could have weathered the rising tide had he only felt that George was with him . But George , strangely and terribly , seemed to have lost his heart in the fight without his determination ; he would no longer discuss it except glumly and sullenly . It might almosthave been his attitude that the whole thing was Harry 's fault and that he was backing him up , not because he wanted the divorce , or , at least , not under those terms , but only because Harry was his friend and he had told Harry he would stick by him . And was that the reason , the crazy reason , that with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking up the firm ? Harry suddenly felt beads of sweat on his broad forehead as the realization dawned that Gerald would never be takingthis attitude if he were not sure of Arthur Irwin . Andp250if Arthur was loyal , the clients would stand firm . God ! Did George know ? But looking around at that brooding face he saw in a second that nothing would dissuade George , and the thought flashed through his mind , for the first time in their friendship , that maybe it was only common sense to leave him now , to go back to the normalcyand camaraderie and homeyness of his old firm , his club  --  " And I assume , Harry , that you will stand by George , " Gerald continued with a little smile . " As you said you would . I could hardly ask you to drop a case that you have started . Well , we shall miss you . But I am sure that the firm of Dilworth and Hamilton will enjoy a great success . I mean that , gentlemen . I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizing for the first time the hostility in those twinkling eyes . This , of course , was what Gerald had always wanted . Gerald had never wanted him to stay ; Gerald had always hated him ! His lips began to droop like a little boy 's ; he was afraid that his eyes would brim with tears . Or did he care ? Did he really care what happened now ? He felt George 's hand on his arm . " Come , Harry . Shall we go now ? We have a lot to talk over , you and I. Shall we go , friend ? " And Harry , grateful at least for the term of address , got up heavily and followed him out.  |p251HEARINGS  in Dilworth vs . Dilworth were resumed the following Monday , but they only lasted for a few hours . There was little more testimony to take . Two weeks later , Judge Cory handed down his decision awardingcustody of Peggy and Jo Dilworth to their father . He wrote a lengthy opinion which was much discussed in legal circles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was obvious from the amount of precedentwhich he cited that he had found the decision a difficult one to arrive at , but he fell back in the end on the one proposition that he could not seem to elude . " In reaching this conclusion I am entirely aware , " he wrote , " that the defendant did not state that she believed that adultery was never a wrongful act . In fact , the implicationis clear from the record that she believes that most adulteries are wrong . This , however , can not alter the vital consideration that the defendant believes that the test of whether or not adultery is wrong is a circumstantial one  --  there is nothing to her inherently immoral in the unfaithfulnessof one spouse to another . Such an attitude , viewed in the light of her own proven adultery , must under our law disqualify her as a guardian of infants . " Bobbie called up Eloise and read her the judge 's opinion on the telephone . " Well , that 's that , " she said dryly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We still ought to appeal it . " " Do you think there 's a chance ? " " Just that . A chance . " When she had hung up she sat on her bed and stared blankly at her reflection in the big glass mirror on the door . In the next room she could hear Irene on the telephone , ordering some part of her trousseau . It was an odd world . For here she was worrying about the costs of appeal , while Irene and Arthur were planning their fabuloustrip around the world , a trip , it was true , on which they had invited her but which she had already declined . She called Carl Landik now , having promised to do so when the trial was over , and made an appointment to lunch with him . Then she left the Stafford and walked down to the building where Lorna 's magazine had its offices . Lorna treated her as if she were a patient and Lorna the doctor when she arrived . She jumped up and practically assisted her into a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You poor darling , " she said solicitously , leaning forward , her elbows on the desk . " What can I do ? " Eloise told her briefly about the court 's decision . " What do they use for laws , anyway ? " Lorna snorted contemptuously . " The Mosaic tablets ? Poor child , what you must be going through . How about a snifter ? I 've got a bottle right here in the bottom drawer . " " No thank you , Lorna , " she said , with just a touch of coolness . " I do n't need a drink . I do n't even need sympathy , as a matter of fact . But I do want advice . Or perhapsrather confirmation . " Lorna , visibly rebuffed , settled her features in an ex/pression of less emotional concern . " Shoot . " " What do you think I mean to Carl ? " Lorna started . " What you mean to him ? " " Oh , come , Lorna , you know exactly what I mean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , he 's enormously fond of you , dear , " Lorna said nervously , " and interested in you , if that 's what you mean . And naturally , since this terrible case he has n't been able to think of anything else , and he could n't discuss it with anyone but me  --  " " Carl came to me before the trial even started , " Eloise cut in , in the definite tone of one who had been over the ground a dozen times before . " He asked me to marry him . Now I think he 'd like to get out of it . Is n't that about the way it stands ? " Lorna turned very red and looked down at the pile of typed manuscripts on her desk . She hesitated for several moments . " Yes , " she said finally , without looking up . " That 's the way it stands , Eloise . I suppose I 'm a bitch to tell you . " Eloise looked at her curiously , wondering what the new expression on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincerity . There were even tears now in Lorna 's eyes , but they failed to move her . She had had enough of the emotions of others . What help were people to one , really ? First they had been sharp with her ; now they were gushing . Like Irene . " Thank you , Lorna , that 's what I thought . " She stood up . " Oh , Eloise , dear . I am sorry . "  | " Do n't be . I 'm quite all right . And , incidentally , I shall be needing your advice . I 'm taking a job . In the new Irwin publishing company . I 'm only a reader , but anywayit 's a start . " Lorna looked impressed . " Definitely a start . I did n't know you knew anyone there . " Eloise smiled at the sudden revival of the old Lorna . " What makes you think I could n't get it on my own ? " she asked as she turned to the door . When she was walking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to her lunch appointment with Carl , she reflected in her still rather stunned state that she had known all along what Lorna had told her . And she really had known , too ; it was not only hindsight . Now she could only close her lips tightly and pray silently to be delivered from the sooty cloud of self-pity that she felt roaring up behind her , knowing that if it overtook her she would never be able to fight herself free , that she would gasp and choke in it until her new being , the new being that she had cared so about , was utterly lost in the image of an Eloise bereft and abandoned and of Lorna and Henry Sterne and Carl meeting for cocktails and telling each other how sorry they felt for her . She met him in the same Italian restaurant where they had first had lunch . He had been waiting for her , obviouslyfor some time , for he simply glanced at his watch , without getting up , when she appeared . He was really in one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching her with preoccupied eyes , crumbling his roll into smaller and smaller pieces as she told him about Judge Cory 's decision , about her new job , about Irene'sp255impending marriage . The atmosphere that he created was constrained , even surly ; it was like their other lunch there when she had done all the talking about her own life , but she became used to it as the meal progressed , hardened to it , playing a part . " Of course , I do n't want to be dependent on Arthur Irwin , " she was explaining as she finished her ravioli . " That 's one reason I took this job . " " Which you got from him , of course , " he pointed out . " Yes , but that 's different from having him support me . Of course , I 'm not going to be a fool . If I find myself really in a jam , I 'll let Irene help . And if I ever get my children  --  George , I assume , wo n't be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all  --  I would let her help there , too . But in the meantime  --  " " In the meantime what about me ? " he demanded sullenly . " Do I play any part in this new life of yours ? " " But that 's why I 'm telling you , Carl , " she protested . " To show you that I 'm not as pathetic as you might think . I 'm all right , do n't you see ? I really am . " " What is this ? A renunciation scene ? " Yet she was even grateful for his rudeness . It eased the constraint . " As a matter of fact , it is . " " And you 're going off to the ball with the count ? " he sneered . " Like Violetta ? " " If he 'll ask me . " " Well , do n't cough yourself to death . I might not be there for the final duet . " " What I do afterwards , Carl Landik , " she said coolly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at her now with resentment , a resent/ment , she reflected , that could n't quite hide his shame . " Is your count by any chance Mr. Chapin ? " " Mr. Chapin happens to be in love with George 's daughter , " she said in a sharper tone . It was too much that he had to cheapen her final gesture , that he was afraid even to owe her that . " As a matter of fact he 's more in love with Hilda than he knows . Bobbie has a lot to learn about himself . " He blushed deeply at this and leaned forward suddenly , his elbows on the table , his forehead buried in his hands . " I 'm a heel , Eloise , " he said in an abrupt change of mood . " You know that , do n't you ? I know all about what you 're doing , and you know I know . You 're givingme an easy out , and I 'm taking it . " He looked up suddenly , defying her to contradict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 're wonderful ! " She stared at him for a moment , her eyes wide . If he was unwilling , then , to cheapen her least gesture , she at least owed it to him to put matters in their true perspective . There was an impulse to accept his tribute , to run out of the restaurant and lose herself in the sooty cloud that had threatened her . But it was only an impulse . " This is n't really a renunciation scene , Carl , " she said , looking down at the table again . " I have n't really anything to renounce . Oh , I 'd like to think that you were crazy about me , of course . But not quite so much , I confess , as I 'd like to think that I was crazy about you . It would be rather pleasantly melancholy , on top of all that 's happened , to think of myself as loving and bereft . " She shrugged her shoulders and smiled , looking up at him . " But that is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can'tp257really kid myself , can I , Carl ? ' What I know about love I may have learned from you , but it 's still more of a teenager'scrush than anything else . It is n't real because I 'm not quite real . Do you see that , Carl ? " " You 're a hell of a lot realler than you were , Eloise , " he said gravely . " You 've come a long , long way since that day in Mogue . " " Oh , do you think so ? " she asked . " Do you really think so ? " He nodded . " It 's going to be all right , " he said , looking away . " And what 's more I 'll tell you something . When you do fall in love , Eloise , I 'm going to be awfully sorry it 's not me . " She reached suddenly for her purse and gloves . " I seem to be always walking out on you in this restaurant , " she said , getting up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a handkerchief and raised it quickly to her eyebrows , just touching them . " Carl , dear , " she said , in a nervous , almost social voice , " call me up in about two months ' time , will you ? By then I should be straightened out . And we can talk again like two civilized beings . Or we can try to , anyway . " She turned away abruptly , just as his hand touched hers , and hurried out of the restaurant.  |p258TWO  MONTHS LATER Eloise 's appeal was heard by five justices of the Appellate Division . It was argued by Bobbie who made as much as he could of the point that a mother 's fitness could not be determined by what she said in an abstract discussion of principle in a court of law . When he had finished , a rather subdued Harry Hamiltonsimply repeated the argument that he had used in the lower court . The court , though again troubled by the harshness of the result , could find no way to get around the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently affirmed . As a matter of law , it was now decided , Eloise was unfit to bring up her own children . When George read the opinion of the Appellate Divisionand realized that the fight was over at last , he felt little enough elation . Life without Eloise and without Hunt &; Livermore had become a very different and a rather disheartening affair . Hilda had proved a poor substitute for her stepmother . In fact , she had become so gloomy that he really no longer wanted her in the apartment . She refused to confide in him and only murmured " Oh , nothing " in an irritable tone when he questioned her about her moodiness . He assumed , of course , that she was moping over that faithless young shyster who had taken Eloise 's case , but he could only thank his stars thatp259Chapin had shown himself in his true colors before things had gone too far between him and Hilda . He shuddered at the thought of a son-in-law who had been his ex-wife 's lawyer and one , too , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better not to think of it . At least there had been that decency left in Eloise . He had finally packed Hilda off to Mexico with a girl friend , overcoming her objections with the only argument that always worked on Hilda , an appeal to her duty of self-improvement . " You can take a trip to Yucatan , " he had pointed out , " and see the Mayan monuments . Here you 've spent your whole life in America and never seen the remains of its earliest culture . " With Hilda gone his household was run by his mother who had come down from New Hampshire to help him . Mrs. Dilworth was a tall , straight , cheerful woman of a determined rectitude of mind and manner . It was impossible to discourage her , impossible to dampen the optimismthat sparkled in her eye or to impede the cliche that leapt from her lips . Yet there was no criticizing her , even to himself ; it was obvious to everyone , with the kind of obviousness that made them immediately want to impart their awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what one might , was an admirable woman . She was admirably aware , too , of how difficult a hand she had to play , and her efforts to play it sportingly were valiant . " Well , did you have an interesting day , George ? " she would greet him in the evenings when he came in . " Did you appear in court ? Did you argue ? " And she would stand up straight , her head tilted slightly back , her eye fixed on him with a strained attention asp260though to defy him to tell her any legal problem , no matterhow long or how involved , that she would not hear to the end , just as she was , without twitching a muscle . " I may not be able to give you the comprehension that you 're accustomed to , " the bright bird 's eye of the poor old lady seemed to flash at him , " but if bodily discipline is any substitute , it 's yours , it 's all I 've got . See how straight I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be expected . In the first weeks of Eloise 's absence Peggy and Jo had rather enjoyed the novelty of their motherless situation and found the company of their kindly and easily beguiled grandmother a pleasant change from the old regime . Boredom , however , had soon filled the void left by novelty . Mrs. Dilworth not only had a tendency to repeat herself , but she insisted on reading them pleasant stories about nice boys and girls which she had brought with her in faded volumes dating from their father 's childhood . They decided that it was time their mother returned . When they went to George to tell him this , however , they were astonished at what happened . He immediately assumed a very grave expression and took them out to buy ice cream sodas and then to the movies . This was gratifying enough , but the next time they tried it they were simply given a long , serious talk about how Mummy would like them to be good girls whether or not she came back . This producedsuch tears and screams that old Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they would be taken to see their mother in a few weeks ' time if they were good . Peggy at this point began to sulk and to cry at night , and a remark made to her at school about herp261mother being " bad " caused such an emotional upheaval that she had to be kept home for a week . Jo , less sensitive , nonetheless saw the value of scenes and was quick to perceivethat one made about Mummy would always go unpunished . Sometimes at breakfast , when Peggy would come in red-eyed and sniveling and Mrs. Dilworth would start indefatigably the daily task of cheering her up , Jo would suddenly stamp both fists on the table and shriek at the top of her lungs : " I want my mummy ! I want my mummy ! " When George left the apartment after one of these breakfasts and went down to the new offices of Dilworth and Hamilton it was not , alas , to find an atmosphere more tranquil . He and Harry had rented an imposing suite " of rooms with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had at Hunt &; Livermore , and they had already hired eight associate lawyers and a staff , but everythingfrom the decoration of the reception hall to the arrangementof the files was still in a state of chaos , and Harry , who loathed administration and organization , who had been accustomed all his legal life to having such detailshandled by the lay employees of a large firm , was constantly storming into George 's office with his hands in the air and screeching about each new " abomination " of which some subordinate , usually so instructed by George , had been guilty . New clients were coming in satisfactorily , it was true , but George did not fool himself . He and Harry had taken a considerable drop in the opinion of the bar , and the woebegone look in Harry 's large watery eyes was sad to see . But it was not until George read in the evening papers that Arthur Irwin andp262Irene had been married that morning in the chambers of a supreme court justice that he realized that the last and largest item had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked out his window over the wintry harbor to the raised arm of the Statue of Liberty he reflectedwith a dull placidity that there was indeed no justice . When he got home that evening his mother met him in the hail . The bright look in her eyes was even shinier than usual , but it was the shine , as he immediately knew , of alarm . " George , Peggy 's sick . " " What does she have ? " " The doctor 's been here , and he says it 's nothing but flu , but her temperature 's up to a hundred and two , and she keeps asking for Eloise . He told me we ought to get her . He said she 'd only make herself sicker if Eloise did n't come . " George put his briefcase down in a corner . It was heavy with papers that he had meant to read that night , and as he straightened up he knew that he had surrendered . It was so simple , so inevitable . Almost as inevitable as saying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in- , terview . " All right , Mother , " he said calmly . " Will you call her ? She 's still at the Stafford . " His mother stepped up to him and gave him a quick kiss . It told worlds of what she had been going through . Then she hurried off to make her call . He went on down the corridor and into Peggy 's dramatically darkened room . " Your mother will be over in just a bit , " he said , sittingp263on the bedside and rumpling her hair . " We thought she 'd better see you . How are you , Peg ? " She sat up and threw her arms around him . " Oh , Daddy ! And will she stay ? Will she stay with us now ? " He heard steps behind him , and Jo came bounding in . " Is Mummy coming ? " " Jo , you know you 're not allowed in here ! " Peggy reprovedher . " I 'm contagious , " she added self-importantly . " And besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Will she stay , Daddy ? " Jo demanded , looking up at him . " Well , I do n't know if she 'll exactly stay , " George said , getting up . " But we 'll fix up something , do n't worry . Come , Jo , we 've got to get out of here . We do n't want to be sick ourselves , do we ? " He was alone in his study later , after dinner , when he heard his mother talking to someone in the hall , and knew that Eloise had arrived . He abandoned all thought of work and paced slowly up and down the room , wondering with a rather blank detachment what had become of his resentment . He even asked himself if she might not be interested , simply as an intellectual matter , to discuss with him the enormity of what had happened to them both . They had always , at least so it had seemed to him , tried to face things rationally . He started when he felt his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going in a minute , George , " she whispered theatrically , as if Eloise , at the other end of the apartment , could hear . " I thought I 'd tell you , so you would n't be caught in the hall . "  | " Do n't be ridiculous , Mother , " he said sharply . " Please tell her that I would appreciate it very much if she would see me before she goes . " " Oh . " Mrs. Dilworth 's expression was suspended as she sought his mood , to know what to conform to . " Oh , George , " she whispered again , " do you think you could ask her to come again ? Do you , George ? The children love it so . I know it 's hard for you , dear , nobody knows that better than I do , but  --  " " I must do as I see best , Mother , " he said impatiently , angered to have her take credit for a greater sympathy for the little girls than his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood near the door a few minutes later , tensely listening to the voices in the hall . His mother was still speaking in that irritating whisper , but he heard Eloise say : " George does ? " and " Really ? " and then he stepped quickly away from the door as he heard her steps . " Did you want to see me , George ? " Her tone was a matter-of-fact as her expression . She looked calm and well . " Please . Wo n't you sit down ? " She sat is the chair in front of his desk , and he in the one behind it . It was like an interview in his office . But that , it occurred to him , was perhaps just what it was . " How did you find Peg ? " " She 'll be all right . It 's nothing , really . " " I hope you will come and see her tomorrow . " There was a slight pause . " Very well , " she said . " Can I come in the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Certainly . " In the silence that followed he realized that it was upp265to him to provide the openings . There was nothing , after all , for her to say . Unless , of course , she said she was sorry for what she had done to him . But he knew she would n't do that . This was implicit in the firm , mildly interested expression that she now turned to him . " I do n't just mean tomorrow , Eloise , " he said in his lawyer 's voice , " or the day after that . Or just when the girls are sick . I want to share them , the way you originally suggested . Of course , you 'll have to get an apartment that 's big enough , but we can work that out later . There wo n't be any trouble about the money . " He looked straight at her as he said this , but his directnesswas a pose , his professional pose . Behind it he was as excited as a small boy , hiding behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday presentthat he has put on his mother 's plate . Eloise , however , did not looked pleased , as a parent might have . Her expression was one of simple astonishment . " You mean you went through all that trial for nothing ? " " Apparently . " " But why , George ? " Her voice for the first time showed feeling . " Why ? Was it just for revenge ? " " I ca n't swing it , Eloise . Mother . The children . The whole deal 's too much for me . " She stared . " You have n't tried long . " " Long enough . " He paused and then looked down at the blotter on his desk . I 'll send one of my boys to see Chapin in the morning . Do n't worry , I wo n't send Harry . They can draw up a new agreement . " She put her fingers to her temples and rubbed them slowly . " Well  --  well , yes , " she said . " God knows it is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all  --  it 's all so bewilder-ing . " " I do n't blame you for being bewildered , Eloise . Would you like a drink ? " " Thanks . I guess I need it . " Relieved at the interruption , he got up and went to the bar and poured whiskey into two glasses . " It 's pretty simple , really , " he said , his back to her . " When you 're spent , you 're spent . Jealousy is like a diseasethat has to run its course . And then it leaves you , feelingflat as a pancake . But cured . " " And you mean all that hate , " she protested , almost as if the waste was too much for her to contemplate , " all that break-up of the firm  --  " " Has been for nothing , " he finished for her , turning and handing her a drink . " As you said . For nothing at all . " There was a certain satisfaction in the superiority of beingable to admit it , of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was seized from time to time by gusts of passion that it was fruitless to resist . What could he do but bow his head before the tempest and then go slowly and philosophically about the reconstruction of his life ? " But you take it so calmly , George . I do n't understand . " " How else can I take it ? " he said , pleased . " I face my-self . " " Yes , I suppose you do . " She nodded reflectively . " I suppose you always have , really . When you lose your temper , you face it . It 's a part of you , I suppose . You give it leash . " But he wanted some reaction besides the intellectual , something less detached , more appreciative . " I wo n't be able to give you as large an allowance asp267before , " he said , " but I 'll do what I can . " She shook her head , as if this were a detail . " I wo n't need it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The girls are in school all day . " " I do n't want you to feel you have to work . " " And as for the apartment , " she continued , ignoring this , " Irene 's will do for me . She 's moving out now , and Arthur 's paid the rent for the rest of the year . " He felt suddenly deflated . Arthur Irwin , of course , with his inexhaustible fortune , would stand forever between him and his generosity . " It 's funny to think of Irene being in a position to help out , " he said bitterly . " I do n't know if I quite like the idea of your being supported by Arthur Irwin . " " You have hardly put yourself in a position recently , George , to complain about who supports me . " " Oh , it 's all right , I guess , " he said gloomily . " For the past , anyway . But I 'd like to look after the bills in the future , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peggy and Jo , " she agreed . " That 's your right and obligation . But as for me , I do n't intend to be supported by you or Arthur . I intend to look after myself . Anything you give me by a legal agreement must come to me on behalf of the girls . I shall keep a strict ac-counting . " George looked at her sadly . The gift that he had laid so hopefully at her place had been critically opened , examinedand accepted without exclamation . His last act of possession had failed . " Eloise , " he said , swallowing hard . " Yes , George ? " He saw by the sudden , startled expression in her eyesp268that she knew what was coming . " Do you think that you and I could ever  --  do you think we could ever make a go of it again ? " " Never . " The word was definite , unsentimental . " Never , " she repeated , shaking her head soberly . " Let me make that very clear . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that you and I could ever be happy together again ? " " Perhaps not , " he conceded reluctantly , for he did n't really see why . " I thought you might have some feeling left . In spite of everything . I know I do . " This , anyway , seemed to crack the hard casing of her mood . " I do n't believe it ! " she exclaimed heatedly . " If you 'd done what you 've done to me out of jealousy , George , I could understand it . There would n't really be anything to forgive . But it was n't that . You went wild at the idea that you were losing something , something that you owned . You 're a miser , George ! Once you get your hands on a person , you 'll never let go ! " " It 's Landik , " he said stubbornly . " You 're going to marry him . That 's it . " She stood up . " I 'm not going to marry anyone , George , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to you . I want to find out first what I am . I want to learn to live with myself . I want to be satisfied with myself as a human being and not only as a daughter or a niece or a wife . I want to go back to where I was when I graduated from college and first met you . " " It would be a fine thing , would n't it , if everyone didp269that ? " he retorted . " If every wife walked out on her husband and concentrated on her own development ? " She stared at him . " Do you really think I walked out on you , George ? " she asked , almost curiously . " Have you really forgotten the door that you slammed in my face ? " " But think what you 'd done , Eloise ! " " And you threw me out , " she answered dryly . " That was it , was n't it ? Very well , I 'm staying out . That 's all . I 'm piecing together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I do n't need your help , George . I 'm going to wake up in the morning and enjoy the simple fact that I 'm Eloise Dilworth . " " You 'll be lonely . Just with Eloise Dilworth . " " I 'll have friends , I hope . New friends . And now , thanks to your decision , I 'll have my children . " He smiled ruefully . He knew when he was beaten . " Well , I wish you luck , Eloise , " he said , holding out his hand . " If you 're going to have new friends , perhaps I might be one of them . " For a bad moment he thought she was going to break down . The defiance had faded from her eyes , and her lower lip trembled . " I do n't want you to think , George , that I do n't know what this whole wretched thing has cost you , " she said with feeling . " I know all about the firm , and if Uncle Gerald had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it . But you 'll build it all up again , I know that . And I 'm sure you 'll marry again , too , but before you do , please , George , come and tell me about it . I think I could give you some advice . And you take advice , too , George . It was one ofp270my faults that I offered so little . " " I 'll come , " he said smiling . " When we 're friends . I 'll like that . " " Thank you , " she said , taking his hand . " I think that 's perhaps the nicest thing you 've ever said to me . " There were things , too many things , that he could have said to this . He only nodded , however , and led her out to the hall to help her into her coat . HILDA IN MEXICO had inattentive eyes for the ruins of the Mayan world . In Yucatan she gazed at the line of temples against the setting sun with only a vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she liked to conjure up when confronted with historical remnants of the vast and gone . But out of her detachment a decision of surprising definleness was formed , and with its formation her spirits slowly improved . In fact her traveling companion , a former roommate at Vassar , to whom she had confided nothing , but who , like everyone else , knew all about Bobbie , observed that she had become almost cheerful . Yet the decision itself was a simple one . When she returned to New York she would go straight to Eloise and simply tell her that she had changed sides . She would impart the same information top271her father and grandmother and proceed to work , in whateverway she could , for an amelioration of the harsh terms of the court 's decree . Very likely they would all turn on her . It could not be helped . She would only be doing what she had to do . When she got back to New York , however , it was to find a situation radically changed from the one she had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Eloise now visited the little girls every afternoon from five to seven . On weekends Peggy and Jo stayed with her at the Stafford . Her father , entirely preoccupied with the development of his new law firm , seemed to have put completely out of his mind the jealousiesand animosities of the preceding months . There was nothing for Hilda to do but move quietly back to her own apartment in the Village , feeling as unwanted and foolish as a crusader of the age of chivalry returning from the Holy Land to find his friends taken up with the small and crass details of a commerce that he had never learned . There was no excuse now to call up Bobbie or even to write him . Instead of arriving in his cheerless camp , as she had planned , with unexpected reinforcements , she would now be coming , late and unbidden , to the celebration of his victory . Gloomily she turned her attention to looking for a job . She wanted one , if possible , that would send her abroad . She was coming out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been interviewed by an importer , when she ran into Bobbie 's roommate , Larry Weavers . She did not immediately recognize his round and friendly features , so smooth and bland and well cared for , rising above his ex/pensive tweeds like a tulip above its stem , but as she watched him coming towards her , smiling and waving , she had a sudden warm feeling of association , and then , just as he called out her name , she remembered him . " Hilda ! " " Larry ! " " But I thought you were in Mexico ! How have you been ? Why , you look like a million dollars , baby . Does Bobbie know you 're back ? " She glanced down at the pavement . " I do n't know why he should . " " I do n't know why he should n't ! We 're having a party this evening . How about it ? Can we count on you ? " " But do you think Bobbie will want me ? " she protested . " You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's happened . " " If he does n't , to hell with him . I want you . Now , then , is it okay ? " She hesitated for a moment and then found herself noddingher head . " That 's my girl . About six ? " She had no more interviews that day . She walked in the park and then sat for two hours at a movie until it was time to dress for the party . Her heart was so filled with excitement that she almost did n't care whether or not Bobbie would be glad to see her . She was going , that was the thing . And if nothing happened , if he was simply politeand sarcastic or even engaged to another girl , at least the turmoil in herself was over . When she arrived at their apartment a little before seven , having made herself stay away till that hour so as not top273seem too anxious , she found the room full of people . Larry came up to her and steered her around . " Bobbie 's in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right out . " Two men came up to talk to her , but she could n't seem to concentrate on what they were saying . She drank her cocktail quickly and asked for another . She had almost finished her second before she saw Bobbie emerge from the kitchen with two shakers of different kinds of cocktails . His eyes fell directly on her , and he started . Then he looked around at Larry . Without a word he went over and put both shakers in his hands . Then he turned and came straight to her , taking her by the elbow and guiding her to the window seat . " So this was Larry 's surprise , " he said . " He was right . It is a surprise . " His blue eyes , perfectly serious , were fixed on her . He was not smiling . " I hoped you would n't mind . " " Mind ? Why should I mind ? You were the one who was always doing the minding . When did you change your mind about cocktail parties ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at her almost empty glass . " And you 're drinking , too , " he observed . " Perhaps you want another cocktail ? " " I 'd love one , thank you . " He waved at Larry who was watching them and came over to fill her glass . " Mexico does strange things , Larry , " he said . " Here 's Hilda just back and hitting the bottle . " " That 's not Mexico , " Larry retorted , winking at her.  | " That 's me . Is n't it , Hilda ? She 'll always drink with a real guy . And I happen to be the one who asked her to this party . Do n't forget that , Chapin . Me . Not you . " " I see , " Bobbie said dryly , as Larry moved off , laughing boisterously . " Well , do n't overdo it . Or maybe I should n't say that . Maybe , as Larry implies , it 's only with me that you disapprove of drinking . " She took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel the gin . " Maybe . " " Frankly , I 'm surprised you speak to me at all . " " You are ? Why ? " " Why do you think ? " " Oh , that . " She thought vaguely of the divorce and then slowly shrugged her shoulders . " That 's all over now , any-way . " He frowned in astonishment . " You mean you do n't care ? " " I did . I cared very much . " She tried to concentrate on what it was she had cared about . " But I thought you were so good to do that for Eloise . " " For Eloise ? Hilda , are you drunk ? " " That 's not polite . " " To hell with politeness ! Are you ? " She considered this . " Maybe a little . But not that much . Must you be so stuffy , Bobbie ? " " Stuffy ? Me ? My God ! " Some people came up and stood before them , chatting with Bobbie . Hilda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time she smiled up , rather fatuously , atp275them . The happiness inside her kept growing and growing , and she wondered if it would n't burst out over her skin like a rash . Bobbie was being rather abrupt with the people , and eventually , they moved off . He turned again to her immediately . " So you were on Eloise 's side ? " She nodded . " Why did n't you write me or tell me ? Did n't you know I 'd care ? " For a moment she plucked at one of the buttons in the upholstery of the window seat . " Not after the way I behaved at the Herberts ' , " she said . " But you were upset . I realized afterwards that you knew then about Eloise . " " Yes . " " You were n't on her side then , were you ? " " No . " " What changed your mind ? " " Oh , I do n't know . " She continued to pluck at the button . " Seeing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And I thought all the time you were sitting there , hating me . " " Oh no , Bobbie ! " He looked at her with almost comic gravity , and she nearly smiled . Quickly she stiffened her lips . " What does this mean , Hilda ? " " What do you think it means ? " she exclaimed . " What would it be apt to mean ? " She wondered in an odd distant way if the amazement in his eyes meant that he was glad . It hardly seemed to matter as long as he would sit there ,  |p276looking  at her and let her go on saying unbelievable things like that . " I 'm glad I said that , " she continued , looking out the window , down into the dark street . " I never thought I 'd be able to say anything like that . " She paused . " I like your party , " she said , changing the subject abruptly and turning from the window to look around the room , " I think I even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocktails . I 'm not at all sure that I 'm not going to have another . " " Oh no , you 're not ! " " You said once that I 'd have to learn to put up with your drinking , " she protested . " I do n't see why you should n't learn to put up with mine . " " Come with me , " he said , getting up . " Where ? " " In the kitchen . I want to talk to you . " She followed him across the room and down the little corridor to the kitchen where a colored man was mixing drinks . " Go , see who needs what , will you , Tom ? " When he had gone , Bobbie closed the door firmly and came over to her . He took her in his arms and kissed her , pressing his hands into her shoulder blades . " Sober up , kid , will you ? " he said . " You do n't have to do this , you know , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have to be nice to me . " " I just have to marry you , is that it ? " " Oh , Bobbie , I hate you ! " She felt the quick tears in her eyes . " I know what I have to do and what I do n't , " he said . " I 'm a lawyer , you know . "  | " You 're free as air ! " she insisted heatedly . " I was . Till you had that third cocktail . " He pulled her back in his arms just as the door opened . It was Larry with an empty shaker . " Oops ! Sorry . " He was backing out , but Bobbie caught the door handle . " Come in , lug . Do n't you ever knock ? I was just talcingsomething out of Miss Dilworth 's eye . " " I see . " Larry came in , leering at them . " It all goes to show I must have a dirty mind . " He made a ceremonious little bow to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has cast out the beam in his own eye , Hilda . Otherwise he might have had competition . By the way , Bobbie , " he continued , turning to his friend . " I told you I had a surprise guest . You did n't mention that you had one . " Bobbie looked blank . " Oh God , " he groaned suddenly . " Not Elaine ? " " No , not Elaine . Not a girl at all , as a matter of fact . Quite the reverse . " Bobbie slapped his forehead . " Oh , him ! " he exclaimed . " I forgot all about him ! " " Well , he 's in there right now , surrounded by the girls . They 're hoping he 'll drop one of his famous four-letter words . You 'd better slip out with Hilda . " " No , " Bobbie paused , thinking quickly . " You stay here a minute with Hilda , and I 'll go in and get him a drink and then tell him there 's been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's got tact . " Hilda opened her mouth , but he was gone , and she was left staring at Larry . " It 's Landik. is n't it ? " she said breathlessly . He nodded.  | " Bobbie must have asked him before he knew you were coming , " he explained . Her heart was beating wildly . Everything in her that could hold back was holding back again , suddenly , sickeningly . She had a sense of happiness draining out of her , through her pores , leaving her in a single minute depleted and dry . " You think I ought to go in and meet him , do n't you ? " she challenged him . He shrugged his shoulders . " I think it would mean a lot to Bobbie , " he said . " But , Larry , I could n't ! " " Well , do n't then . " She looked at him miserably , pleading against his neutrality . " But you think I should ? " she persisted . She was afraid he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then he nodded . " I should ? " she repeated . And it came over her with a rush that , of course , she should , not only should but wanted to , and at the same time she stood there quite still , electrified with the wonderfulrealization that it was not too late . It was like a dream , it was not too late , not yet anyway , but soon it would be , any moment , while she stood there  --  " Well , hurry ! " Larry exclaimed . She ran out of the kitchen and almost collided with Bobbie and a short , dark-haired young man as they were walking towards the front door . She took Carl 's hand impulsivelyand shook it while she stared into his astonished eyes.  | " I 'm Hilda Dilworth , " she said excitedly , " and I 'm sorry to embarrass you . But I want you to know that I do n't have any feeling any more about you or about Eloise , or about  --  well , anything . " She felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart pounded at the thought that she might not have done it . Carl was blushing furiously , of course , but it was all right . " I certainly thank you for saying that , Miss Dilworth , " he stammered . " I 'm sure  --  well I 'm sure it was a hard thing to say . " " Come on back in , Carl , " Bobbie was saying . " Now we 're all friends we 'll have a drink on it . All except Hilda , that is . Hilda , I think , has had enough for tonight . " And Hilda , standing beside them as they drank their cocktails and talked about basketball , tongue-tied as only one can be who has said her piece and said all , reflected how strange it was to feel at once so embarrassed and still so utterly at ease.
