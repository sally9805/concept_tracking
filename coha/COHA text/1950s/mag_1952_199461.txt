Last week Harry Truman boarded an Air Force Constellation in Washington and headed for Arkansas , His prime objective was the dedication of the big new Bull Shoals Dam on the White River . But he succumbed to campaign fever almost as soon as he breathed the hot summer air of the outlands . <P> He switched from his plane to a special Missouri Pacific Lines train at Little Rock . When it pulled into the station at Newport ( pop . 6,262 ) , 84 miles up the line , patient knots of people were waiting in the heat under the platform lights . It was a sight the President could not resist . <P> He hustled right outside . " This happens to be the No. 1 whistle stop of 1952 , " he said , raising his voice to compensate for the lack of a loudspeaker . " There are going to be a lot more of them . " <P> Next day he teed off on the G.O.P. In a back-platform speech to 5,000 people at Batesville ( pop . 6,371 ) , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man or woman in this audience who is not better off as a result of 20 years of Democratic rule . Now if you want to throw that out the window cries of " No ! No ! " from the crowd and go off after false gods ... I ca n't stop you . But do a little thinking ... " <P> His appearance at the dam got off to a wonderful beginning . The country around had been parched for weeks , but almost as the President began speaking , rain fell . " It looks like I really brought you good luck , " he said . His speech was an appeal for Southern loyalty to the Democratic Party . <P> " You people . . . know what it was like in the South in the 1930s ... the backward farms ... the struggling businesses ... the bank failures . What a difference today . I know the New Deal and the Fair Deal have done more for the South than any other national administration in ... history . " He talked of new factories , rehabilitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes and healthy children . " Remember . . . this year when you see &; hear the storm of political propaganda that will be used to try to turn back the clock . " He spoke four times during the day and flew back to Washington . <P> Last week the President also : <P> Paid a surprise call on the Senate , got a rising ovation from both Democratic and Republican members , heard Vice President Alben Barkley eulogize him as a " great President . " <P> Explained how he expects to reveal his choice for Democratic nominee : Tom Gavin of Kansas City , an old friend and Delegate Harry Truman 's alternate , will vote on the first ballot at the national convention for Truman 's candidate . <P> Went to Washington 's Griffith Stadium with Mrs. Truman to see a doubleheader between the New York Yankees and the Washington Senators . He sat patiently under an umbrella after rain stopped play in the fourth inning , munched a hot dog , and had a bottle of pop . But after an hour , Weather Prophet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another hour passed before the sun came out and the game was resumed .
