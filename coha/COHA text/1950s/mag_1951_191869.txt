Kim Il Sung , Communism 's titular leader of North Korea , has been out of the news for months . Last week he popped up with a couple of choice quotes broadcast by Radio Peking : 1 ) the war , said Kim , is " turning favorably " for the Reds , who will ultimately " drive the aggressors out of Korea " ; 2 ) when the U.N . forces retreated from North Korea last year , the Reds , said Kim , found the bodies of 150 children in an icy cave . Kim supplied details : " After the Americans drove them in and bolted the door , these children were starved and frozen to death . Practically all the corpses had broken fingers , evidently caused by trying to pry the cave door open . "
