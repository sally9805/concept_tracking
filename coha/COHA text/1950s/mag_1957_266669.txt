When Hurricane Audrey roared up toward the Gulf Coast last summer ( TIME , July 8 ) , the only physician in the marshland town of Cameron ( pop . 3,000 ) , at the southwestern corner of Louisiana , was Cecil William Clark , 33 , who ran a community medical center with a twelve-bed hospital . Dr. Clark was confident that his new brick house would ride out the storm , but he was worried about the frame clinic building ( with only a brick veneer ) and its eight bedfast patients . Leaving their three youngest children at home with a maid , Dr. Clark and his wife Sybil ( a nurse-anesthetist ) set out soon after 2 a.m. to evacuate the hospital 's nurses and patients . <P> Audrey was ahead of the forecasters ' schedule and piling up an unexpectedly high tide . The wind-lashed , rising water covered the road , blocked Dr. Clark 's car . He turned back , took his wife home . He tried again to get through in a neighbor 's pickup , failed again , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinic . Helped by deputy sheriffs with boats , the nurses got the patients to the safety of the solidly built parish courthouse . Dr. Clark tried to walk back home , but waist-deep water forced him to shelter in a concrete-block house . Ten hours passed before the water subsided enough for a messenger to get through with the word : Dr. Clark was needed at the courthouse , which was packed with hundreds of survivors , many injured or ill . <P> Clark sloshed to the courthouse and went to work , dressing wounds , administering sedatives , giving anti-tetanus and penicillin shots with supplies salvaged from the clinic . Soon he got word that his fine new home had simply disappeared . There was no sign of his wife or their three youngest children , aged 2 months to three years . <P> Dr. Clark was equally fearful for his two eldest boys , 7 and 8 , who had been spending the night at his mother 's home in nearby Creole . Nevertheless , steady-nerved and set of jaw , he worked without letup for more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word got through that the two boys had been saved by being lashed to the tops of oak trees . His wife , he learned , had survived by scrambling onto the floating roof of the collapsed Clark house , but the children , though she desperately tried to hold on to them , were swept away . <P> For the Louisiana-born doctor and his wife , there was still much work to be done in death-dealing Audrey 's wake . The medical center was swept off its foundations and badly damaged ; all equipment , supplies and records were destroyed . By now , much of it has been renovated , and in the works is a new eight-room wing . <P> Last week , meeting in Philadelphia , the A.M.A. gave Dr. Clark a gold medal and named him " General Practitioner of the Year .
