txt Strong support for the Senate Banking Committee 's friendly study of the stock market came from the Federal Reserve Board chairman today . William McChesney Martin Jr . said that the board , like the committee , had become concerned by the atmosphere of the market and had wanted to call attention to it without putting an undue crimp in it . The action it took in January was to raise margin requirements  --  that is , to cut the use of credit from 50 to 40 per cent in stock deals . " Our law says to prevent the excessive use of credit , " Mr. Martin said , " and that seemed the right psychological juncture . " The stock market staggered Monday under some of the heaviest selling in years . At the lows of the day , prices , as measured by The New York Times composite average of fifty representative listed issues , were down 8.78 points , for the largest one-day decline since Sept. 3 , 1946 . At the close , the index stood at 263.82 , off 7.03 points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outbreak of the Korean war . Ending Margins Opposed The committee has been concerned with the development of over-speculation , the means to control it and with " too great preoccupation with capital gains . " Mr. Martin opposed all suggestions that the stock market should be required to operate without credit . He asserted that over a period in which credit for all purposes had expanded about $200,000,000,000 , that for carrying securities had advanced only about $2,000,000,000 . " The stock market , " he said , " should not be denied access to credit , unless you want to promote a lower standard of living . " He admitted , however , that raising margins would have been " a wiser policy " in 1929 . Despite his welcome backing for the committee 's work , Mr. Martin came under attack for Federal Reserve Board credit policies in 1953 . Senators J. William Fulbright be Arkansas , the committee chairman , and Paul H. Douglas of Illinois , both Democrats , declared that these policies had been inconsistent . Mr. Douglas believed they deserved the attention of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury and Reserve Board had tightened money rates at the same time that they had lowered stock market margin requirements . Senator Fulbright and the for7.er committee chairman , Senator Homer Capehart , Republican of Indiana , also clashed . Senator Capehart , fresh from a television appearance with Walter Winchell , attempted to gain acceptance for a contention that the committee from the start had been trying to show that stocks were too high . Mr. Capehart charged the committee 's investigation  --  for which he voted  --  with bringing about a $7,000,000,000 decline in stock prices last week . To prove his point , he read the first page of the statement with which Senator Fulbright opened the hearings . " Read the second page , " Mr. Fulbright said . Senator Capehart did so and founc himself reciting : " The basic issue before this committee is not whether stock prices are too high , whether they can safely go higher or whether they can be driven down . " Shortly thereafter he left the committee table . Mr. Martin became president of the New York Stock Exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had served as a Federal Reserve bank examiner and as a brokerage house partner . I He was appointed chairman of I the Federal Reserve Board by President Truman in 1951 and was continued in that office by President Eisenhower . Mr. Martin emphasized to the Senate committee that no responsibility for determining the level at which stocks should sell had been given to the Federal Reserve Board . " In my judgment , " he declared , " a properly functioning stock market is important to the attainment of a high standard of living and steady growth of employment opportunities for all the people . " We could not today have our system of mass production and distribution if it were not possible for corporate enterprises to assemble through the securities markets varying amount ? of individual savings into large aggregates of capital . " " It is difficult to define what constitutes ' excessive use of credit ' in stock markets , or for that matter in any field , " Mr. Martin added . " It is largely a question of judgment and not merely a statistical computation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , it seems to me that there are certain signs or symptoms of unhealthy tendencies when business men or the public become unduly preoccupied with stock markets and stock prices . An unsound speculative psychology may then develop that can have adverse effects throughout the economy . " Senator Capehart asked if stock were too high in relation to other goods . When Mr. Martin declined to give an opinion , the Senator pressed hard for statistics gathered by the Federal Reserve . Under pressure and without comment , Mr. Martin and Ralph A. Young , Federal Reserve research chief , provided figures comparing September , 1929 , and March . 1955 . Wholesale prices were shown r ? to have risen from 62 to 110 , consumers ' prices from 73 to 114 and stocks from 238 to 278 . I Senator Fulbright asked why , in February , 1953 , while the Federal Reserve Board and the Treasury were tightening credit generally , the margin requirements on stock should have been lowered from 75 to 50 per cent . Margin is the proportion of cash or equivalent value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of securities . The change described raised the total that could be carried by 50 per cent . " In the immediate hysteria after the Korean outbreak , " Mr. Martin said , " we invoked all the weapons in our arsenal with the exception of general credit control . " In January , 1951 , he declared , regulations were enforced on consumer and real estate credit . Stock margins were increased from 50 to 75 per cent and the volume of credit was restricted , he added . At the beginning of 1953 , Mr. Martin said , the specialized controls over consumer and mortgage credit were removed . " Since we were going , to depend on . general credit controls , ' he added , " it was important not to discriininate against the stock market . " Senator Fulbright recalled that money was tightened generally by interest rate increases . Mr. Martin replied that the economy at that time was marked by " an inordinate demand for credit . " Perhaps , he conceded , the pressure should have been applied in late 1952 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should be relying on general controls , we should not have had to put on the brakes so hard that they screeched . " Bringing the credit picture up to the present , Mr. Martin said that the dollar had a tendency to be too easy in late 1954 . As for the stock market , he said , there had been a great increase in new accounts , many of them opened by persons with no experience in the stock market . Again , the market was appearing on the front pages of Ithe newspapers " and - there seemed to be some preoccupation with it , " he declared . " We did n't want to do anything that would put an undue crimp in the market , " he said , " but something that would call attention to it . " The January increase in margin requirements from 50 to 60 per cent was the answer . Senator Fulbright noted that more stringent margin increases had been made on smaller stock market advances . Mr. Martin . replied that conditions had so changed  --  with a drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market from control , to name two  --  that no valid comparison was available . Senator Douglas , a former Professor of Economics , also took up fiscal and credit policies in early 1953 . At that time , he said , the Treasury and the Federal Reserve followed parallel policies designed to tighten money . " What is the consistency , " he asked , " in trying to check inflation and to crush activity la business and at the same time lowering the margin requirements on stocks ? Those are mutually inconsistent policies . Were n't you mounting your horse and riding off in all direc-tions ? " Mr. Martin said that Federal authorities were then limited to using general controls , having lost the specialized controls over consumer and mortgage credit . He insisted that credit must be looked on " as a moving picture , not a still picture . " Senator Douglas asserted that the Federal authorities , by va . rious actions , had reduced reserves in the member banks of the Federal Reserve System by $800,000,000.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
