A Story by WALLACE STEGNER The Wolfer YES , I saw a good deal of it , and I knew them all . It was my business to , and in those days it was n't hard to know nearly every man between Willow Bunch and Fort Walsh , even the drifters ; the women you could count on your two thumbs . One was Molly Henry at the T-Down Bar , the other was Amy Schulz , living with a reformed whiskey trader named Frost up on Oxarart Creek . I knew Schulz , too , and his miserable boy . At least I had seen him a good many times , and stopped with him a half-dozen times at one or another shack when I was out on patrol , and at least that many times had come within an are of being eaten by his hound . Probably I knew him better than most people did , actually . Friends  --  that 's another matter . He was about as easy to be friendly with as a wolverine . Summers , he camped around in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the shacks that the cattle outfits maintained out along the Whitcmud , on the patrol trail between the Hills and Wood Mountain . Two of them , at Stonepile and Pinto Horse Butte , were abandoned Mounted Police patrol posts  --  abandoned in the sense that no constables were stationed there , though we kept the barracks stocked with emergency supplies and always cut and stacked a few tons of prairie wool there in the fall . Both Schulz and I used the barracks now and then , for he as a wolfer and I as a Mountie coveredpretty much the same territory . If the truth were known , I kept pretty close tab on him in my patrol book , because I was never entirely sure , after Amy left him , that he would n't go back up on Oxarart Creek and shoot Frost . Probably I wronged him . I think he was glad to get rid of Amy ; it freed him to be as wild as the wolves he hunted , with his snuffling adenoidal boy for a slave and daily killing for occupation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair : each was the only living thing that liked the other , I guess , and it was a question which had the edge in savagery . Yet love , too , of a kind . I have heard him croon and mutter to that thing , baby-talk , in a way to give you the creeps . Whenever I found Schulz at Stonepile or Pinto Horse I picked an upper bunk ; if the hound got drooling for my blood in the night I wanted to be where he 'd at least have to climb to get at inc . There was no making up to him  --  he was Schulz 's , body and soul . He looked at every other human being with yellow eyes as steady as a snake 's , the hackles lifting between his shoulders and a rumble going away down in his chest . I 'd hear him moving in the dark shack , soft and heavy , with his nails clicking on the boards . He wore a fighting collar studded with brass spikes , he stood as high as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forty pounds . Schulz bragged that he had killed wolves single-handed . The rest of the pack , Russian wolfhounds and Russian-greyhound crosses , slept in the stable and were just dogs , but this staghound thing , which Schulz called Puma , was the physical shape of his own savagery : hostile , suspicious , 54 THE WOLFER deadly , unwinking . I have seen him stand with a foolish , passive smile on his face while that monster put his paws up on his shoulders and lapped mouth and chin and eyes with a tongue the size of a coal shovel . He was a savage , a wild man . He hated civilization  --  which meant maybe two hundred cowpunchers and Mounties scattered over ten thousand square miles of prairie  --  but it was not civilization that did him in . It was the wild , the very savagery he trusted and thought he controlled . I know about that too , because I followed the last tracks he and his hound made in this country . My patrol books would show the date . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The patrol was routine  --  Eastend , Bates Camp , Stonepile , the Warholes , Pinto Horse Butte , Wood Mountain , and return  --  but nothing else was routine that winter . With a month still to go , it was already a disaster . Since November there had been nothing but blizzards , freezing Fogs , and cold snaps down to forty below . One Chinook  --  and that lasted only long enough to melt everything to mush , whereupon another cold snap came on and locked the country in a four-inch shell of ice . A lot of cattle that lay down that night never got up ; froze in and starved there . That time , just about Christmas , I passed the Warholes on a patrol and found a m.dtis named Big Antoine and twenty of his Indian relatives trapped and half-starved . They had made a run for it from Wood Mountain toward Big Stick Lake when the Chinook blew up , and got caught out . When I found them they had n't eaten anything in two weeks except skin-and-bone beef that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fat from coyotes , the only thing besides the wolves that throve . A police freighter got them out before I came back on my next trip . But the cowpunchers out in the range shacks were by that time just about as bad off . For weeks they had been out every day roping steers frozen into the drifts , and dragging them free ; or they had been floundering around chasing cattle out of the deep snow of the bottoms and out onto the benches where the wind kept a little feed bare . They had got them up there several times , but they had n't kept them there . The wind came across those flats loaded with buckshot , and the cattle turned their tails to it and came right back down to starve . At one point the two Turkey Track boys stationed at Pinto Horse had even tried to make a drag of poles , and drag bare a patch of hillsidefor the cattle to feed on . All they did was kill off their ponies . When I came by in Mardi they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the barracks , and laying bets whether the winter would last till August , or whether it would go right on through and start over . W E HAD a little poker game that night . Whenever the talk died we could hear , through the logs and sod of the shack , the heavy hunting song of wolves drawn down from the hills for the big barbecue . It was a gloomy thing to hear . Say what you want about cowpunchers. they do n't like failing at a job any better than other people . And they were sure failing . In November there had been close to 70,000 head of cattle on that Whitemud range . At a conservative guess , half of them were dead already . If we did n't get a Chinook in the next week , there would n't be a cow alive come spring . 1 quit the game early to get some sleep , and for a joke pushed the deck over toward Curly Withers for a cut . " Cut a Chinook , " I said . He turned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door for a look-see , and everything was wooled up in freezing log , what nowadays they call a whiteout . You could have cut sheep out of the air with tin shears . " Some Chinook , " Curly said . In the morning there was still no wind , but the air was clear . As I turned Dude down the trail and looked back to wave at the Turkey Track boys I had the feeling they were only six inches high , like carved figures in a German toy scene . The shack was hraced from eaves to ground with icicles ; the sky behind the quiver of heat from the stovepipe jiggled like melting glass . Away down in the southeast , low and heatless , the sun was only a small painted dazzle . It seemed mean and cowardly to leave those boys out there . Or maybe it was just that l hated to start another day of hard cold riding through all that death , with nobody to talk to . You can feel mighty small and lonesome riding through that country in winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was leading a packhorse , and ordinarily there is a good deal of jingle and creak and sound of company with two ponies , but that morning it did n't seem my noises carried ten feet . Down in the river trough everything was still and white . Mainly the channel had a fur of frozen snow on it , but here and there were patches of black slick ice full of air bubbles like quarters and silver dollars . Depending on how A STORY BY WALLACE STEGNER 55 the bends swung , drifts sloped up to the cut-banks or up to bars overgrown with snow smothered rose bushes and willows . I crossed the tracks of three wolves angling upriver , side by side and bunched in clusters of four:galloping . They must have been running just for the bell of it , or else they had sighted an antelope or deer . They did n't have to gallop to eat beef . Without wind , it was n't had riding , though when I breathed through my mouth the aching of my teeth reminded me that under the Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now a dead steer among the rose bushes , untouched by wolves or coyotes . I cut a notch in a tally stick , curious ahou t how many would pass between Pinto Horse and Eastend . Farther on , a bunch of whitefaces lying and standing so close together they had breathed frost all over one another . If they had n't been such skeletons they would have looked like farmyard beasts in a creche . They were n't trapped or frozen in , but they were making no move to get out  --  only bawled at me hopelessly as I passed . Two were dead and half drifted over . I cut two more notches . In three hours I cut a good many more , one of them at a big wallow and scramble near the mouth of Snake Creek where wolves had pulled down a steer since the last snowfall . The blood frozen into the snow was bright as paint , as if it had been spilled only minutes before . Parts of the carcass had been dragged in every direction . Those wolves rubbed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of where Schulz and his boy were camped at Stonepile . I wondered if he had had any luck yet  --  he had n't had any at all last time I saw him  --  and I debated whether to stop with him or go on to Bates and heat up a cold shack . The decision was for Bates . It was no big blowout to spend a night with the Schulzes , who were a long way from being the company the T-Down and Turkey Track boys were , and who besides were dirtier than Indians . Also I thought 1 would sleep better at Bates than 1 would at Stoncpile , in an upper bunk with my hand on a gun while that hound prowled around in the dark and rumbled every time I rolled over . Sure Schulz had it trained , but all he had hold of it with was his voice ; I would have liked a chain better . J U S T to make a check on Stonepile for the patrol book , I turned up Snake Creek , and a little after noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Schulz boy standingbare-armed before the barracks door with a dishpan hanging from his hand . The dishpan steamed , his arm steamed , the sunken snow where he had flung the ' dishwater steamed . I was quite pleased with him , just then ; I had n't known he and his old man ever washed their dishes . He stood looking at me with his sullen , droop-lipped watchful face , one finger absent-mindedly up his nose . Down in the stable the wolfhounds began to bark and whine and howl . I saw nothing of Schulz or the big hound . " Howdy , Bud , " I said . " How 's tricks ? ' ' He was sure no chocolate-box picture . His gray flannel shirt was shiny with grease , his face was pimply , long black hair hung from under the muskrat cap that I had never seen off his head . I think he slept in it , and I 'll guarantee it was crawling . He never could meet a man 's eyes . He took- his finger out of his nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constable . " I creaked down . Dude pushed me from be-hind , rubbing the icicles off his nose . " Pa not around : " I said . Something flickered in his eyes , a wet gray gleam . One eye-socket and temple , I saw , were puffy and discolored  --  about a three-day-old black eye . He touched one cracked red wrist to his chapped mouth and burst out , " Pa went out yesterday and ai n't come back ! " With a long drag he blew his nose through his mouth and spit sideways into the snow . His eyes hunted mine and ducked away instantly . " And Puma got out ! " he said  --  wailed , almost . At that moment I would n't have trusted him a rope-length out of my sight . He looked sneakily guilty , he had that black eye which could only be a souvenir from Daddy , he had fifteen years of good reasons for hating his old man . If Schulz and his hound were really missing , T had the conviction that I would find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could have blamed young Schulz too much . In the best seasons his old man must have been a bearcat to live with . In this one , when he had hunted and trapped all winter and never got a single wolf , he was a crazy man . The wolves walked around his traps laughing  --  they fed much too well to he tempted . - They sat just out of rifle shot and watched him waste ammunition . And though he had the best pack of dogs in that country , he had n't been able to run them for months because of the weather and the deep snow . Out on the flats the dogs could have run , but there were no wolves there ; they were all down in the bottoms hobnobbing with the cattle . The last time I had passed through , Schulz had talked to me half the night like a man half-crazed with rage : red-faced , jerky-voiced , glassy-eyed . To make his troubles worse , he had headaches , he said ; " bunches " on his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a winter of complete hard luck , who made a better whipping boy than that sullen son of his ? And who more likely , nursing his black eye and his grievance , to lie behind the cabin or stable and pot his father as he came up the trail ? It was a fine theory . Pity it was n't sound . I told young Schulz to hold it while I turned the horses into the police haystack , and while I was down there I got a look around the stable and corrals . No bodies , no blood , no signs of a fight . Then up in the barracks , in the hot , close , tallowy-mousy room with muskrat and marten pelts on bows of red willow hanging from the ceiling and coyote and lynx hides tacked on the wall , and three spirals of last-year 's flypaper , black with last year 's flies , moving in the hot air above the stove , I began asking him questions and undid all my nice imaginary murder . I even began to doubt that anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hound , for it became clear at once that if Schulz was in trouble he was in trouble through some accident , and I did n't believe that the Schulzes had accidents . They might get killed , but they did n't have accidents . It was about as likely that he would freeze , or get lost , or fall through a rapid , or hurt himself with a gun , as it was that a wolf would slip and sprain his ankle . And if you bring up those bunches on his head , and the horse that he said fell on him , I 'll bet you one thing . I 'll bet you the horse got hurt worse than Schulz did . Still , he was missing , and in that country and that weather it could be serious . He had left the barracks the morning before , on foot but carrying snowshoes , to check on some carcasses he had poisoned down by Bates Camp . Usually he did n't use poison because of the dogs . Now he would have baited traps with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could have got wolves that way . He shut the wolfhounds in the stable and die staghound in the barracks and told the boy to keep them locked up . The staghound especially had to be watched . He was used to going everywhere with Schulz , and he might follow him if he were let out . That was exactly what he did do . Young Schulz kept him in the barracks  --  it would have been like being caged with a lion  --  until nearly dark , when he went down to the stable to throwsome frozen beef to the other dogs . He slid out and slammed the door ahead of the staghound 's rush . But when he came back he was n't so lucky . The dog was waiting with his nose to the crack , and when it opened he threw his hundred and forty pounds against the door and was gone . No one but Schulz would have blamed the boy  --  ever try to stop a bronc from coming through a corral gate , when you 're there on foot and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of the way or you get trompled . That hound would have trompled you the same way . But Schulz would n't think of that . The boy was scared sick of what his father would do to him if and when he came back . I thought that since the hound had not come back , he obviously must have found Schulz . IF he had found him alive and unhurt , they would be back together before long . If he had found him hurt , he would stay with him , and with any luck I could find them simply by following their tracks . I asked the boy if he was afraid to stay alone two or three days , if necessary . He was n't ? it was exactly the opposite he was scared of . Also I told him to stay put , and not get in a panic and take off across a hundred miles of open country for Malta or somewhere ; I would see to it that his old man laid off the horsewhip . Somebody  --  his old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within three days at the latest . He stood in the doorway with his arms still bare , a tough kid actually , a sort of wild animal himself , though of an unattractive kind , and watched me with those wet little gleaming eyes as I rode off down Snake Creek . CO U L D N ' T have had better trailing . The light snow two nights before had put a nice firm rippled coating over every old track . When I hit the liver the channel was perfectly clean except for Schutz ' moccasin tracks , and braided in among them the tracks of the hound . A wolf makes a big track , especially with his front feet  --  I 've seen them nearly six inches each way  --  but that staghound had feet the size of a plate , and he was so heavy that in deep snow , even a packed drift , he sank way down . So there they went , the companionable tracks of a man and his dog out hunting . If 1 had n't known otherwise I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six hours apart . The clay had got almost warm . Under the north bank the sun had thawed an occasional rooty dark spot . I kneed Dude into a shuffle . the packhorse dragged hard and then came along . I could have followed that trail at a lope . It led me four miles up the river 's meanders before 1 even had to slow down , though I cut four more notches in the tally stick and saw two thin does and a buck flounder away from the ford below Sucker Creek , and took a snapshot with the carbine at a coyote , fatter than I ever saw a coyote , that stood watching me from a embank . My bullet kicked snow at the cut-bank 's lip and he was gone like smoke . Then a mile above Sucker Creek I found where Schulz had put on his snowshoes and cut across the neck of a bend . The hound had wallowed after him , leaving a trail like a horse . The drifts were hard-crusted under the powder , but not hard-crusted enough , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They stood heaving while I got off to look at a little tent-like shelter with fresh snow shoveled over it .. The hound had messed things up some , sniffing around , but he had not disturbed the set . Looking in , 1 found a marten in a No. 2 coyote trap , caught around the neck and one front leg . He was n't warm , but he was n't quite frozen either . I stuffed marten and trap into a saddlebag and went on . The trail led out of the river valley and up a side coulee where among thin red willows a spring came warm enough from the ground to stay unfrozen for several feet . The wolfer had made another marten set there , and then had ! unshed up onto the bench and northwest to a slough where tules whiskered up through the ice and a half-dozen very high muskrat houses rose out of the clear ice farther out . At the edge of the slough I got off and followed where man and hound had gone out on the ice . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rats make along the bottom . For some reason this slough was n't frozen nearly as deep as the river , maybe because there were springs , or because of organic matter rotting in the water . The Royal Society will have to settle that sometime . All I settled was that Schulz had chopped through the ice in two places and set coyote traps in the paths , and had broken through the tops of three houses to make sets inside . He had a rat in one of the house sets . Since I seemed to he running his trapline for him , I put it in the other saddlebag . Nothing , surely , had happened to Schulz up to here . The hound had been at every set , sniffing out the trail . That would have been pretty late , well after dark , when the fog had already shut off the half moon . It occurred to me as I got back on Dude and felt the icy saddle tinder my pants again that 1 would not have liked to be out there on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go by in the mist , with his nose to his master 's track . F R 0 M the slough the trail cut back to the river ; in fifteen minutes I looked down onto the snowed-over cabin and buried corrals of Bates Camp . There had been nobody stationed in it since the T-Down fed its last hay almost two months before . No smoke from the stovepipe , no sign of life . My hope that I would find the wailer holed up there , so that I could get out of the saddle and brew a pot of tea and eat fifty pounds or so of supper , went glimmering . Something had drawn him away from here . He would have reached Bates about the same time of clay I reached it  --  between two and three in the afternoon  --  for though he was a tremendous walker he could not have covered eight miles , some of it on snowshoes , and set seven traps , in less than about four hours . I had then been on his trail more than two hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't gone near the shack at all , but had turned down toward the corrals , buried so deep that only the top pole showed . Wading along leading the horses , I followed the web tracks to the carcass of a yearling shorthorn half dug out of the snow . There were confusing tracks all around  --  snowshoes , dog , wolf . The shorthorn had died with his tongue out , and a wolf had torn it from his head . The carcass was chewed up some , but not scattered . Schulz had circled it about six feet away , and at one place deep web tracks showed where he had squatted down close . I stood in the tracks and squatted too , and in front of me , half obscured by the dog 's prints , I saw where something had rolled in the snow . Snagged in the crust was a long gray-black hair . A wolf , then . This was one of the poisoned carcasses , and a wolf that rolled might be sick . Squatting in the quenched afternoon , Schulz would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darting his eyes around the deceptive shapes of snow and dusk , and he would not have waited a second to track the wolf to his dying-place . The coyotes he ran or shot , and the marten and muskrat he trapped when nothing better offered , were nothing to him ; it was wolves that made ' us wild blood go , and they had cheated him all winter . F C ) R just a minute I let myself yearn for the cabin and a fire and a hot meal . But I still had an hour and a half of light good enough for trailing  --  about what Schulz himself had had  --  and after that maybe another half-hour of deceptive shadows , ghostly moonlight , phosphorescent snow , and gathering mist and dark . If he had got hurt somehow chasing the wolf , he might have survived one night ; he could n't possibly survive two . So I paused only long enough to put the packhorse in the stable and give him a bait of oats , and to light a fire to take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I set the damper and took out on the trail again . It was like a pursuit game played too long and complicated too far , to the point of the ridiculous  --  like one of these cartoons of a big fish swallowing a smaller fish swallowing a smaller fish swallowing a small fish . There wentthe sick wolf running from the heat of the strychnine in his own guts , and after him the wailer , implacable in the blue-white cold , and after him the great hound running silently , hours behind but gaining , loping hard down the river ice or sniffing out the first marten set . There went wildness pursued by hate pursued by love , and after the lot of them me , everybody 's rescuer , everybody 's nursemaid , the law on a tired horse . Schulz never did catch up with that wolf . Probably it had never been sick at all , but had rolled in the snow in sassy contempt , the way a dog will kick dirt back over his scats . Up on the . bench its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trotting , and after a half mile or so another set of wolf tracks came in from the west , and the two went off together in the one-two-one of an easy lope . Schulz quit , either because he saw it was hopeless or because the light gave out on him . I could imagine his state of mind . Just possibly , too , he had begun to worry . With darkness and fog and the night cold coming on , that open fiat bare of even a scrap of sagebrush was no place to be . in an hour the freak windlessness could give way to a blizzard ; a wind right straight off the North Pole , and temperatures to match . could light on him with hardly a warning , and then even a Schulz could he in trouble . Above me , as I studied his tracks where he broke off the chase , a chip of moon was pale and blurry against a greenish sky ; the sun over the Cypress Hills was low and strengthless . It would go out before it went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been lost ; he must have looked np from his furious pursuit and his furious reading of failure , and seen only misty dusk , without landmarks , moon , stars , anything , for instead of heading back for the river and the cabin he started straight eastward across the plain . So did I , because I had to . It took him about a mile to realize his mistake , and it was easy to read his mind from his footprints , for there out in the middle of the empty snowilats they milled around a little and made an eloquent right angle toward the south . Probably he had felt out his direction from the drifts , which ran like shallow sea-waves toward the southeast . I turned after him thankfully . But he had n't gone back to Bates , and he had n't gone back downriver to Stonepile . So where in hell had he gone ? I worked the cold out of my stiff cheeks , and flapped my arms to warm my hands . and kicked old Dude into a tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was plowing down into the river valley again . The sun was blurring out , the bottoms were full of shadows the color of a gunbarrel , the snow was scratched with black willows . I judged that I was not more than a mile upriver from Bates . The plowing web tracks and the wallowing trail of the hound went ahead of me through deep drifts and across the bar onto the river ice , and coming after them I saw under the opposite cutbank the black of a dead fire . I stopped . There was no sign of life , though the snow , I could see , was much tracked . I shouted : " Schulz ? " and the sound went out in that white desolation like a match dropped in the snow . This looked like the end of the trail , and because it began to look serious , and I did n't want to track things up until I got a chance to study them , I tied the horse in the willows and circled to come into the bend from below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice , I looked straight down on the body of Schulz 's hound . D E A D . he looked absolutely enormous . He lay on his side with his spiked collar up around his ears . I saw that he had been dragged by it from the direction of the fire . He had bled a great deal from the mouth , and had been bleeding as he was dragged , for the snow along the drag mark had a filigree of red . On the back of his head , almost at his neck , was a frozen bloody patch . And along the trough where the body had been dragged came a line of tracks , the unmistakable tracks of Schulz 's moccasins . Another set went back . That was all . It was as clear as printing on a page . Schulz had draped the dead dog to the edge of the hank , under the overhanging bushes , and left him there , and not come back . I tell you , I was spooked . My hair stood on end , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a fright that I might be under somebody 's eyes or gun . On the frozen river there was not a sound . As I slid down beside the hound I looked both ways in the channel , half expecting to see Schulz 's body too , or somebody else 's . Nothing . Clean snow . The hound 's body was frozen rock hard . His mouth was full of frozen blood , and the crusted patch on the back of his neck turned out to be a bullet hole , a big one . He had been shot in the mouth , apparently by a soft-nosed bullet that had torn the back of his head off . And no tracks , there or anywhere , except those of Schulz himself . I knew that Schulz never used any gun buta .22 , in which he shot long rifle cartridges notched so they would mushroom and tear a big internal hole and stop without making a second puncture in the hide . If he had shot the hound  --  and that was totally incredible , but who else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have gone clear through brain and skull and blown a big hole out the other side unless it had been fired at close range , so close that even in fog or half-dark the wolfer must have known what he was shooting at . But I refused to believe what my eyes told me must be true . I could conceive of Schulz shooting his son , and I had already that day suspected his son of shooting him . But I could not believe that he would ever , unless by accident , shoot that dog . Since it did n't seem he could have shot it accidentally , someone else must have shot it . It took me ten minutes to prove to myself that there were no tracks around there except the wolfer 's . I found those , in fact , leading on upriver , and since I had looked at every footprint he made from Stonepile on , I knew these must be the ones he made going out . Instead of going home , he went on . Why ? Under the cutbank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path beaten in the snow where Schulz had walked up and clown many times . The fire itself had never been large , but it had burned a long time ; the coals were stink deeply into the snow and frozen in their own melt . Schulz had evidently stayed many hours , perhaps all night . keeping the little fire going and walking up and down to keep from freezing . But why had n't he walked a mile downriver and slept warm at Bates ? I might have followed to try to find out , but the light was beginning to go , and I was too cold and tired to think of riding any more of that crooked river that night . Still , just thinking about it gave me an idea . In any mile , the Whitemud ran toward every point of the compass , swinging and returning on itself . If Schulz had hit it after the fog closed in thick , he would have known that Bates lay downriver , but how would he know which way was downriver ? There were no rapids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but bends and bars endlessly repeating , changing places , now on the right and now on the left . Some of the bends were bowknots that completely reversed their direction . That might answer one question , but only one . I put myself in the path he had made , and walked up and down trying to see everything 60 THE WOLFER just as he had . I found the mark where he had stuck his rifle butt-down in the snow , probably to leave his arms free for swinging against the cold . There were hound tracks on the path and alongside it , as if the dog had walked up and down with him . At two places it had lain down in the snow off to the side . That answered another question . or corroborated what I had guessed before : Schulz could n't have shot the hound not knowing what it was ; it had been there with him for some time . Standing by the fire , I looked back at the deep tracks where Schulz , and after him the hound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hound 's tracks led directly to the fire and the path . I walked the path again , searching every foot of it . I found only one thing more : just where the path went along a streak of clear ice , where ice and snow joined in a thin crust , there were the deep parallel gouges of claws , two sets of them , close together . Would a heavy hound , rearing to put its front paws on a man 's shoulders and its happy tongue in a man 's face , dig that way , deeply , with its hind claws ? I thought it would . I S TO OD at the spot where I thought Schulz and the hound might have met , and again studied die-tracks and the places where the hound had lain down . In front of one of them was a light scoop , just the rippled surface taken off the new snow . Made by a tongue lapping ? Maybe . Cy pure intensity of imagining I tried to reconstruct what might have happened . Suppose it went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the visibility no more than fifty or a hundred feet , and could not tell which way it ran . The fact that he had lost himself up on the bench made that nut merely possible , but probable . A fire , then , until daylight let him see . Willows yielded a little thin fuel , the tiny heat along leg or backside or on the turned stiff hands made the night bearable . But caution would have told anyone as experienced as Schulz that the night was long and fuel short  --  and at Pinto Horse the night before the thermometer had stood at fifteen below . He would have had to keep moving , the rifle stuck in a drift and his arms flailing and the felt cap he wore pulled down to expose only his eyes and mouth  --  a figure as savage and forlorn as something caught out of its cave at the race 's dim beginning . The sound of hunting wolves would have kept him company as it had kept us company in our social poker game , and it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did . Except for that dark monotone howling there would have been no sound in the shrouded bend except the creak of his moccasins and the hiss of the fire threatening always to melt itself nut  --  no other sound unless maybe the grating of anger in his own aching head , an anger lonely , venomous , and incurable , always there like the pressure of those " bunches- on his skull . I could imagine it well enough : too well . For the first time , that day or ever , I felt sorry for Schulz . Endless walking through frozen hours ; endless thinking ; endless anger and frustration . And then  --  maybe ? ? the noise of something coming . a harsh and terrifying noise smashing in on his aloneness , as something big and fast plowed through the snowy brush and came scraping and sliding down the bank . Schulz would have reached the gun in one leap ( I looked , but could find no sign to prove he had ) . Assuming he did : while he crouched there , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves humming with panic , here came materializing out of the white darkness a great bony shape whining love . And been shot as it rushed up to greet Schulz , shot in the moment of fright when the oncoming thing could have been wolf or worse ? It would have been plausible if it had n't been for those hound tracks that went up and down along the path on the ice , and that place where the toenails had dug in as if the hound had reared to put its paws on the wolfer 's shoulders . If there was ever a time when Schulz would have welcomed the hound , greeted it , talked to it in his mixture of baby talk , questions , and grunts of endearment , this would have been the time . The coming of the dog should have made the night thirty degrees warmer and hours shorter . Surely the hound , having pursued him for ten miles or so , would have stuck close , kept him company in his pacing . stood with him whenever he built up the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had walked up and down the path only two or three times . Twice it had lain down . Once , perhaps , it had lapped up snow . And this hound , following Schulz 's tracks with blind love  --  and wiled all day , since it had escaped before the Schulz boy could feed it  --  had passed , sniffed around , perhaps eaten of , the carcass of the yearling at Bates Camp . Suppose Schulz. had looked up from his stiff pacing and seen the hound rolling , or feverishly gulping snow . Suppose that in the murk , out of the corner of his eye , he had seen it stagger to its feet . Suppose , in the flicker of the fire , its great jaws had been opening and closing and A STORY BY WALLACE STEGNER that foam had dripped from its chops . Suppose a tight moment of alarm and disbelief , a tableau of freezing man and crazed hound , the deadliest creature and his deadly pet . Suppose it started toward him . Suppose the wolfer spoke to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Charge ! " which usually dropped the dog as if it had been poleaxed  --  and the hound still came on . Suppose he yelled a cracking yell , and the hound lumbered into a gallop , charging him . The spring for the gun , the mitt snatched off between the teeth , the stiffened finger pulling the trigger , a snapshot from the waist : Schulz was a good shot , or a lucky one ; he had had to be . Suppose . I supposed it , I tell you , in a way to give myself gooseflesh . By the vividness of imagination or the freakishness of the fading light , the hound 's tracks arranged themselves so that only those decisive , final ones were clear . They led directly from one of the places where it had lain down to the bloody scramble where it had died , and if I read them right they came at a scattering gallop . Standing in the path , Schulz would have fired with the hound no more than thirty feet away . Its momentum had carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped it off . When Schulz , with what paralysis in his guts and shaking in his muscles , lowered his gun and went up to the dead pet that his own poison had turned into an enemy , he had only three steps to go . I went over to the hound and took off his collar , evidence , maybe , or a sort of souvenir . Dude was drooping in the willows with his head down to his knees . It was growing dark , but the fog that had threatened was evidently not going to come on ; the moon 's shape was in the sky . W HAT Schulz had done after the shoot- ing of the hound was up for guesses . He had had to stay through the night until he knew which way was which . But then he had made those tracks upriver  --  whether heading for the T-Down for some reason , or wandering out of his head , or simply , in disgust and despair , starting on foot out of the country . I would find out tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I Ied Dude down onto the ice and climbed on , the moon had swum clear , with a big ring around it . There was no aurora ; the sky behind the thin remaining mist was blue-black and polished . Just for a second , when I took off a mitt and reached back to unbuckle the saddlebag and put the hound 's collar inside , I laid my hand on themarten , stiff-frozen under soft fur . It gave me an unpleasant shock , somehow . I pulled my hand away as if the marten might have bitten me . Riding up the channel , I heard the wind beginning to whine under the eaves of the cut-banks , and a flurry of snow came down on me , and a trail of drift blew eastward ahead of me down the middle of the ice . The moon sat up above me like a polished brass cuspidor in a high-class saloon , but that could be deceptive ; within minutes the wrack of another storm could be blowing it tinder . Then I rode out into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and was gone , then back again . The willows shuddered in a gust . Dude 's head came up , and so did mine , because that wind blew out of hundreds of miles of snowy waste as if it wafted across orange groves straight from Florida : instantly , in its first breath , there was a promise of incredible spring . I have felt the beginnings of many a Chinook ; I never felt one that I liked better than that one . Before I reached Bates I was riding with my earlaps up and my collar open . I had heard a willow or two shed its load of snow and snap upright . The going under Dude 's feet was no longer the squeaky dryness of hard cold , but had gone mushy . By morning the coulees and draws would be full of the sound of water running under the sagged and heavied drifts ; the rims of the river valley and patches of watery prairie might be worn bare and brown . There might be cattle on their feet again , learning again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because this was a wind they could face , and the prairie wool that had been only inches below their feet all winter would be prickling up into sight . Something  --  not much but something  --  might yet be saved out of that winter . That night I went to bed full of the sense of rescue , happy as a boy scenting spring , eased of a long strain , and I never thought until morning , when I looked out with the Chinook still blowing strong and saw the channel of the Whitemud running ten inches of water on top of the ice , that now I would n't be able to follow to their end the single line of tracks , by that time pursuing nothing and unpursued , that led upriver into ambiguity . By the time I woke up , Schulz 's last tracks were on their way toward the Milk and the Missouri in the spring breakup ; and so was his last fire ; and so , probably was the body of his great hound ; and so , for all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ArriV ; IIP . 1.1 law
