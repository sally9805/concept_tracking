txt  | for monotony ; too many curves may make for confusion and restlessness . Repetition of shapes or lines should not be evenly or obviously spaced , if you want to avoid sameness . Thus , it is better to place one round table , balanced by an oblong one , than to use two pairs of round tables , equidistant from each other , on opposite sides of the room . If you like your furniture to run around the room on one level , you must still break the eye level somewhere with a tall piece , or a different wall grouping . Rhythm is achieved by the conscious use of different shapes and sizes of furniture , and by using colors repeated in different strengths or in different amounts , scattered throughout the room or the house . You can also play light against dark colors for effect or light and dark woods . It goes without saying that because rhythm is the spice of your scheme , you do n't want to overdo it . That is why you start with balance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizes are fine in their place , but if you overemphasize them , you are breaking down much that you 've tried hard to build as a foundation . Like pepper and salt , it 's wiser to move cautiously . You can always add more , but it 's hard to subtract . Any room that you work with is a fixed background for a number of human activities . What you put in your room must be consistent and harmonious with the activities for which the room is designed . This harmony can be achieved in a number of ways which are not always perfectly apparent or tangible . So , Early American , French and Italian Provincial , and Modern , as styles , are harmonious in the same room because ? thought of in the abstract ? they each represent a definite ideal of informality , even though their shapes and sizes may not be at all similar . Or , harmony of another kind can be created by using furniture of the same period from different countries , such as Adam , Hepplewhite , Sheraton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discreet mixture . In this case , the furniture not only represents the same idea ? a return to classic formality ? but sizes and shapes are harmonious , as well . You will always have to pay a lot of attention to furniture arrangement , so be sure ? after you work out a series of groupings which fit your purpose ? that each arrangement is consistent . This means that large case pieces and upholstered pieces follow wall lines or are placed at right angles to them . An exception would be any of the number of modern sectional " room-divider " types of case piece which , of course , arc placed  | not parallel to but at right angles to the wall . Small pieces can afford to ignore this orderly arrangement , such as an occasional chair and table placed on a diagonal , but too many such placements in a large room work for confusion instead of harmony . Patterns and textures in a room must be harmonious . Do n't mix brocades with coarse tweeds , ordinarily , unless you are working out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of a great variety of different textures . Similarly , you try for some related color theme as well as scale between your wallpaper and your chintz and your carpet , to say nothing of upholstered pieces . If your room has a sense of order and consistency ( in other words , if there is a real idea behind it ) you will have gone a long way toward a feeling of harmony . Part of this ordered look is a matter of line . Horizontal lines are restful . That is why many modern and Oriental rooms ( such as Japanese or Hawaiian interiors ) seem serene . Vertical lines , on the other hand , are strong and vigorous . Diagonal lines are dangerous , because they create motion , and lead the eye in a restless fashion . That is why diagonal patterns in wallpaper and fabric are often vaguely disturbing , and why furniture and rugs placed on a diagonal are not pleasing . However , furniture designed specifically for corners , such as corner cabinets , washstands , shelves , or corner tables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it creates are appropriate . Another way to create order and harmony is to provide a center of interest which dominates everything else in the room . In historic times this center of interest was inevitably the fireplace ; and even today , in spite of radiant heating and all the conveniences of the atomic age , an open hearth may still be your focal point . But , if you do n't have , or do n't want , a fireplace , you can build up a center of interest which is nonarchitectural . An obvious example would be a large sofa with a picture grouping above , a large cocktail table before it , and a pleasant conversational arrangement of chairs and tables around it . Emphasizing any one feature over all others in a room can bring order out of chaos . Having mastered the larger elements which control the successful result in any job of interior designing , you are free to investigate the next big controlling factor ? color .  | WHAT is a " good " color scheme , and how do you go about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a scheme which pleases you . Secondly , it has to be appropriate to the room you are putting together or the house you are completing . You would n't use pale , " Adam " period colors , for instance , in an Arizona ranch home , no matter how beautiful they might be in their proper , highly refined , and sophisticated setting . Third , your color scheme must have some sort of unity , which means that you must plan it around a dominant theme . Last , but certainly just as important to a successful result , your scheme must have variety and interest . The safe scheme is likely to be the one which everyone but you thinks dull and monotonous . Individual colors have a peculiarly personal psychological effect . Your scheme has to start out with this point firmly established . The color of the largest area in the room determines the scheme or key to your room composition . Sit down ? or walk into your room , if you 're starting from scratch ? and spend some time mulling over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restful or brilliant and exciting . Will it be an appropriate background for a quiet , secluded type of family living ? You might use a scheme of dark gray walls , a soft green in a carpet , other grays and greens in upholstery , white curtains for crispness , and brass lighting fixtures or accessories to add a touch of warmth and gleaming highlight to a restful setting . Or , if you want a backdrop for a round of constant entertainment , a room that must always be on impersonal display , try dead-white walls ( perfect as a background for any colored dress or suit ) with any strong color you particularly like , such as delphinium blues and purples , or brilliant orange and yellow nasturtium hues , or  | Chinese pink and snuff brown , with black as an accent . If you arc fond of period styles and mahogany furniture , you will find that an elegant and fragile scheme such as ice blue on walls and upholstery , a hyacinth blue carpet , with gray and white spotted elsewhere in the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you live in a tiny apartment , and like it , paint your ceiling and walls your favorite color ; paint your furniture ( if it is n't too valuable ) so that it merges in color into the walls , and cover your upholstered furniture in the same color so that it disappears as well . An all-of-a-color scheme does wonders for small spaces . In other words , when you tackle a color scheme , ask yourself how you live , and your color scheme should evolve naturally . Color works in mysterious ways , its wonders to perform , but a little direct thinking and practice will save you a lot of time , headaches , and expense in handling this tricky medium . Color is the most personal aspect of your house , and you should welcome it as a tool for self-expression , not fear it as some enigma which only the privileged few are able to solve . Love of color is constantly being cited as a characteristic of today 's thinking in relation to interior design . But what color ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tricks , as you will see . It can emphasize form ( put a dark piece of furniture against a pale wall and see how it stands out ) . It can create movement in a room ( spot bright color around a room and notice how it forces your eye to jump from one brilliant accent to the other ) . It can make an interior a unit which is serene or make it an area electric with tension ( contrast an all-beige room with one which uses flame walls combined with black and white ) . It can open up walls or close them in ( the difference can be seen by painting the same room sky blue , or chocolate brown ) . Color has been doing all these things ( and many more ) for centuries . It is doubtful if we are any more color conscious than the man of the Renaissance , for instance . But we talk about it more . Color will work for you , not against you , if you take the trouble to study a few well-defined laws which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't bother , and the result is likely to be chaos . Once you have a working knowledge of color , no one can take it away from you , any more than the multiplication table or " Thirty days hath September . " If you know the rules , you are a free agent . You are n't tied to formulas or cliches or period colors or fashions in color . Your color scheme will be  | A light , cool color scheme makes a room seem larger . The same area appears smaller in a dark , warm color .  | personal to you . Color is often the one thing which makes an interior or a home distinctive . It should be distinctively yours . Learning the rules does n't mean that you have to study treatises , of which there are a baffling number . In fact , if you spend some time learning by experience , you 'll understand much more and have much more confidence in your own color sense . Since you are well aware that fashion in decoration ? as everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else , you will start out by taking a lot that you hear in current color promotions with a large dash of salt . Reading about a color scheme or hearing about it or even seeing it does n't substitute in any way for an intelligent and personal appraisal of your own particular problem . The colors which look so well in a display room or in the pages of a magazine may be perfect for the purposes of the store or the publication , but it may be very likely that they wo n't look right if you wrap the whole scheme up intact and take it home . This is because color is a personal sensation . It may be very carefully worked out in the case of a professional , but it is still a color scheme which is personal to him , not to you . Learn to think on your own about color . You 'll be much happier than you would be if you borrowed someone else 's formula . If you know your color elements , you can create your own scheme as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours . If you study the rules which follow you will enjoy analyzing the schemes you see around you in friends ' homes or in the stores . You will be able to tell why a certain scheme works out in a particular instance . You will also know enough to see that it is dangerous to apply that formula to a different situation , possibly your own , where color requirements are entirely dissimilar . Every color has a style element and a personal element . Play up the personal angle and play down the style feature . Colors that are in style this spring are usually out of style by the following fall or by the following year . If your scheme is personal to you , it will outlast these seasonal changes . An exception would be a case where you are trying to create a period room in the style of American Georgian , for instance . From your knowledge of period colors ( covered in the " Guide to Period Styles , " which follows ) you will know what colors were used in that period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , depending on how authentic you want to he . An example of this approach is the so-called " Williamshurg colors , "  | which are manufactured to accord with a careful analysis of a series of eighteenth-century American formulas . Before you begin to tackle your color scheme it is a good idea to be aware of a few patterns which you should avoid . Do n't try to compartmentalize and categorize color . You are freer now than at any stage in the history of decoration to use color as you please . Up to now , interior designers worried about color in relation to period . The Neo-Classic style , for instance , went back to the antique colors of the Greeks and the Romans . Today you are able to work in period colors , if you are doing your Louis XV room , or you can perfectly well disregard them and use contemporary colors to bring your scheme up to the minute . If you do n't want to tie yourself down to period color , do n't bind yourself to other , more nebulous categories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take well to flower colors and flower patterns , because they are fresh without being blatant , restful without being dull . But there is no reason at all why you might not use very dark walls , such as charcoal , for instance , and introduce only one strong color as contrast , such as a brilliant lime green , with sandcolored upholstery ? if you like a dark bedroom . Avoid color recipes . It is a complicated and very roundabout way to build up a scheme for your room from a painting by Matisse , for example . First of all , a painting in oil is not a three-dimensional room of quite a different scale . It takes a very shrewd analysis of color proportion to repeat the Matisse scheme , color area for color area , in an interior . And then you have to worry about such things as texture and lighting , and all the other factors which subtly or unsubtly change your sure-fire scheme . The same thing happens when you try to build a color scheme around a chintz or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colorists in the way of composition and distribution of color , and it wo n't do you any harm to be color conscious enough to take notes . But do n't expect your translation to work too per cent . There is no reason why ? if you take the same pains as they did ? you ca n't come up with your own ideas . Do n't worry too much about exposure when you plan your rooms . The pat setup is cool colors on the south side of the house or apartment , warm colors on the north . But remember that hot colors are favorites in Mexico and the Southwest . After all , it comes down to the fact that you like a certain color scheme more than another , regardless of theory and  | regardless of exposure . And , of course , this applies as well to a number of city apartments which get little or no direct light . If you have the kind of a city apartment which is occupied mostly after dark , you will be wise to concentrate on such important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your color scheme , rather than worrying about exposure . Do n't spend too much time studying the symbolism of color . You will find endless discussions of what purple means , for instance . All of that is academically interesting , but it does n't help you to put your room together . Another aspect of name-calling is the infinite variety of trade names which firms attach to their products each season . Such indefinite terms as " storm , " to describe a certain gray , throw you into a never-never land of vagueness and confusion of which there is quite enough already in the color field . Above all , be definite about color . Indefinite colors , like indefinite shapes , are characterless . And you have only to think of " oatmeal " paper so recently in fashion ( and still used in some homes ) to see how a vague color can destroy the personality of a room . A color , to mean anything , must be identifiable . It may be bright and pure , or rich and deep , or a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of precision in itself , and in the way in which it is used . Your color sense , like anything else about your taste , can be developed . Being color conscious about your rooms is quite a different thing from being self-conscious about color . A well-planned room , colorwise , is a room which is first and foremost designed to be the best possible background for you , your family , and your friends . A self-conscious color scheme , on the other hand , is bound to be too obviously contrived . It allows no one to show up to advantage . Do n't work too hard for your effect . Everyone reacts spontaneously , one way or the other , to the gay , fresh color schemes associated with Pennsylvania Dutch , for instance . They react another way to the rich reds , gilt , and dark mahogany , typical of a Georgian interior . You do n't have to know all about color to react to one scheme or another , but you do have to study color before you can be color conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country which seemed too " busy " and wearisome , or a severe , modern room at a friend 's house which looked flat and monotonous because it  | had too little color contrast or none at all . Both of these rooms failed not because of the colors used but because of their disposition . When you are color conscious , you will see at once that the color you select for your room is much less important a decision than the value or the proportion of that color as it is used . Any color is a good color , by itself . It 's the use to which it 's put , or its combination that counts . Everyone loves color , and everyone loves to see fresh color combinations . Color comes in thousands of packages , some more familiar than others . But there is nothing to prevent you from working up an infinite number of combinations for yourself ? if you take the time and have the patience . If you are going to develop a natural color sense ? as opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to your brushes and paints , and your water-color pad . All you need are five tubes of paint ? a tube each of red , yellow , blue , white , and black ? a brush , and some paper , and you 're off . Try this method for a short while and see how much you learn , what surprises you get , and how much fun you have . You will learn more in an hour 's mixing than in whole days poring over charts and learned tomes on the subject of color . The color you are interested in is pigment . Decorators , designers , painters , and dyers are all concerned with this aspect of color . But you should know that this is far from the complete story . There is also the physicist 's approach . As he sees it , color is light . The psychologist , on the other hand , sees the effect of color on the mind . He is the one who talks of " advancing " and " retreating " colors , of " warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who sets up the symbols which tell you , among other things , that red is " exciting . " To the average person , a neutral is no apparent color . It can be black , white , or gray . ( From the physicist 's point of view , black is the absence of light and pure white is invisible . But you can disregard these technicalities for the time being . ) The Primaries are red , yellow , and blue . They are simple elements in themselves , and no two other colors can be mixed to produce them . Mix them all together , in equal parts , and they give you a neutral gray . The Binaries ( " bi " meaning two ) are mixed from equal parts of  | two primary colors . Thus : one-half yellow , plus one-half blue equals green . One-half blue , plus one-half red , equals violet . One-half red , plus one-half yellow , equals orange . The Tertiaries are made up of equal parts of a binary and a primary . Thus : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green is half yellow , therefore the proportions of yellow are two to one . Similarly , one-half green , plus one-half blue , equals blue-green . Green is half blue , therefore the proportions here are blue , two to one . Going down the list , equal parts of blue and violet give blue-violet ; violet and red give redviolet ; red and orange give red-orange ; orange and yellow give yelloworange . The Quaternaries are mixed in similar fashion from the tertiaries . When you 've gotten acquainted with your colors , you are ready to set up your color wheel . Yellow is always placed at twelve o'clock , and the colors swing clockwise , from yellow through yellow-green , green , bluegreen , blue , etc. , back to yellow . You can use circles for your colors , or any other form you prefer , but whatever they are , they should be equally spaced one from the other . Next , at the very center of your wheel , place your neutral gray ( which , in the wheel , results from a mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The color wheel is your greatest tool in setting up a good color combination , so do n't slight it . If there are certain colors which you like more than others ? take green for instance ? you will see instantly , on the color wheel , what will go with that particular hue , in the same color  | family . Or , you will know what will complement it , from the opposite side of the color wheel . Your mixing has told you the exact proportion of colors in your binary or tertiary or quaternary color . You will discover how to neutralize a color by its complement . You will progress to learning something about painting a wall dark to make it " advance , " or a ceiling dark to make it " come down , " if it is too tall . You are ready to experiment with breaking up long or square rooms with color . You will be able to mix your own color with a sure idea of how it will look on the wall . And you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are fortunate enough to find one who will listen . After you have made your color wheel you should do a value scale , in neutrals , from white to black . This is more difficult than a color wheel , but equally profitable later on . After ruling off nine vertical divisions , fill in white in the top square , and black in the bottom . The center square should be a gray midway between the lightness of white and the darkness of black ( it is a mixture of these two pigments , of course ) . You will find that you will have to make about two dozen washes before you can select the seven that seem to make an evenly graduated scale between black and white . Once you have your value scale you can compare any of your mixed colors to it for value . Obviously , you know without comparing that Cadmium Yellow is lighter in value than Cobalt ; but do you know whether Burnt Sienna is lighter or darker than Indian Red ? As an experiment , use dark glasses on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised how quickly it helps you decide on values , once you are removed from the emotional impact of the hue itself . Once you have even a little experience with color-mixing , stop for a moment and memorize a bit of the vocabulary of the subject . Hue is the name of a color . Red is a hue , and so is yellow-green . Value is the light or dark quality of a hue . It tells you whether a hue is nearer white or nearer black . Intensity , or chroma , is the brightness or dullness of a hue , its strength or its weakness . Normal color is a center or middle value , between light and dark . Values lighter than normal are tints . Values darker than normal are shades . When you mix a color or hue with a neutral on the value scale ( or its direct apposite on the color wheel ) you have " grayed " it . This means you have dulled it from its normal intensity . Obviously , if you continue to gray your color , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . An ideal way to gray or neutralize a color is to mix three parts of one color with one part of its complementary ( the color directly opposite it on the color wheel ) . An example would be three parts yellow to one part violet . Avoid too much graying if you want to avoid muddy , dirty tones . Grayed colors are generally thought of as being more sophisticated than bright colors , or colors used full strength . Just how far you can gray your initial color before it goes dead and muddy is a nice balance of taste and experience in color work . With the knowledge you have acquired from mixing your color wheel and your value chart you are now more able to understand some related facts about color that will help you when you sit down to work out your scheme . About values : Pale or light values increase the apparent size of an object . The more white a color has , the more it reflects light . Dark values decrease size . But note well that this is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping size ( as an example , take a lacquered breakfront ) . In this case , the object is big enough to be attention-getting by itself . Black intensifies its weight . Close values are those near each other on the value scale . They are safe , but they may easily be wishy-washy and monotonous in unskillful hands . Strong contrasts in value are dynamite in a room . Most people prefer their shocks of this kind to appear in public rooms , such as hotel lobbies or restaurants , bars , and night clubs . About intensity : Comparative intensity or brilliance of a color  | depends on light . The same color in brilliant sunshine or a heavily curtained room looks quite different . Surfaces turned away from a source of light are darker and less intense than those turned toward the light . And relative intensities are not constant in all kinds of illumination . By daylight , violet is the darkest color , yellow the lightest . By fading light , blues and purples appear lighter in intensity than yellows and reds . As light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same relative intensities . All of which means that your ultimate color scheme must be judged by daylight and by artificial light . Artificial light today may mean a combination of " white " fluorescent light and yellow incandescent ; and some new fluorescent bulbs do new tricks in intensifying color ( see " Know Your Lighting " ) . You will see to it that your color scheme looks well under the light it mostly gets ? if you are wise . A dominant color does n't have to be brilliant or at its strongest intensity . Adjacent colors will affect it . Thus , a color becomes more intense when : ( i ) it is placed next to its complement ; ( 2 ) when it is placed next to black , white , or gray ; or ( 3 ) when it is placed near a large area of the same color in a lower intensity ( such as Kelly green on hunter green ) . A brilliant color is more stimulating to the eye than a neutralized color . That is one reason why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless you want the resulting shock appeal for one reason or another ( in a dark , gloomy elevator foyer , or a cellar game room , for instance ) . Ordinarily , primaries are alive and vigorous . Binaries are more refined and easier to live with . But tints have a different emotional quality than shades . Usually warm colors or hues make the most pleasing shades . Cool hues make the best tints . ( Red , orange , and yellow sections of your color wheel are warm , by common consent . And the green , blue , and violet section is called cool . ) About contrast : The first rule of color contrast is that two colors placed side by side modify each other . Place green next to blue . The green looks yellower , and the blue looks more violet . This is because the yellow ? which is one of the primaries used to make up green ? is emphasized because it is lacking in the nearby blue . The blue has a purplish cast because there is no red in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark against a light . The dark appears darker : the light looks lighter . Normal colors ( in middle value ) look paler against black , because black absorbs color . Conversely , normal colors against white are stronger , because white reflects light and its  | adjacent color . A normal color against gray is more inconspicuous , because gray neutralizes color . Here is where your combination of colors may come a cropper . Place everything which is going in your room as much as possible together , in sample form . Bring home your swatches ( or better yet , sample lengths ) of fabric , your piece of wallpaper , your rug sample , or whatever , and try them out , in the relationship in which they will appear . Do not hold them all up together to the light . Your rug will lie on the floor , and what light does to its texture in that position changes its apparent color . Tack up your drapery length against the light , if that is where it is going to hang . Its color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a light and also on a dark wall , if it is going all around the room . You will see how its color changes relationship according to its position . You are now juggling not only contrasting colors but intensity as well . When you are working , you will notice another property of adjacent colors : reflected color . One colored surface reflects another , in greater or lesser degree , depending on its intensity , or its relative area . A bunch of buttercups held under the chin in children 's games is a good example of reflected color . You will notice that a wall color bounces off a white ceiling in much the same way . About proportion : As a corollary of the law of intensity , you should know that the larger the area the more neutralized the color should be , under usual circumstances . Or , put another way , the smaller the object , the more intense the color can be . This is why color accents are generally confined to accessories , such as pillows , pictures , ceramics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as emphatic as the objects placed on them . This includes you and your family and friends , who will move against these backgrounds . Do not work up a color scheme which is all right by itself , on paper , but all wrong for your coloring . Warm tones , properly neutralized , tend to hold your scheme together . This is because they advance toward you , bringing with them the warm tones of the woods in your room . Cool colors do the opposite , because they are retreating . Anything placed against them has a look of being separated from its background . This is good if you have a particularly fine rich mahogany highboy , for instance , or a modern chest in cordovan finish , which you want to show off to its best advantage . In these cases you might use an ice-blue wall , for instance , or any other tint you like . But if your piece of furniture is not meant to dominate the room , try it against a warm background .  | Another aspect of emphasis is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a room . One color must dominate . This emphasis will pull your room together and give it character . What that color will be is entirely a personal matter . Certain colors irritate some people but seem perfectly wonderful to others . Choose the color which means something to you . There is no law that says that red ca n't be used in your bedroom , even though the stock recipe for bedrooms is something more restful , like blues or greens . In general , remember only that the decoration of rooms used for short intervals can be more daring than the treatment for those in use for long periods . Getting back to your color wheel , there are several well-tried color harmonies , or schemes , which have worked out in the past for others and which may work out for you .  | The simplest of all is the Monochromatic scheme . " Mono " means one , and this is a scheme of tints and shades of the same color . It is harder than it looks , because unless you vary it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus different textures , you may end up with monotony . You can also add black , white , or gray , because these are n't thought of as colors . The next simplest scheme is the Analogous scheme . In this scheme , the same colors recur in different proportions in its composition . These colors always lie next to each other on the color wheel , and a typical scheme of this kind would run from yellow , through yellow-green , green , and blue-green , to blue . The mixed primaries take on a common element ? green . They can be used together in full strength , or grayed , and they can be varied with black or white . Complementary color schemes involve colors which are directly opposite each other on the color wheel . They are as unlike each other as possible , and they ca n't be used in equal amounts or they will clash . Decide which color , cool or hot , you want to dominate , and play it up . Play down the other . ' A complementary scheme may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow and violet , for instance . A split complementary contains all the elements of the simple scheme , but in different proportions . Thus , you can combine violet with yellow-orange and yellow-green , or you can combine ( to get more complicated ) redviolet with yellow=green , and blue-violet with yellow-orange , all in the same room . A split complementary is more pleasing as a rule than a straight complementary scheme . A Triad scheme is worked up by fitting a triangle over your wheel , its points striking a color at regular intervals ( such as yellow , red , and blue ) . By turning the triangle , you get other combinations . These three colors , as indicated , may be used in any value or intensity , and they can , of course , be combined with white , black , or gray . So far , you have been thinking of color in terms of pigment . But you must graduate to considering color combined with texture as well , before you are through . Metal , marble , glass , ceramics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as paints and varnishes , all have a texture story which alters color . The same color in velvet or satin looks different because of each fabric 's capacity for absorbing or reflecting light . A  | Chinese vase , in a characteristic red , like sang de boeuf , is quite a different matter from the same color in rubber tile . It is the intelligent use of texture , combined with color , which will often make or break your room and give it just the variety it needs to rescue it from mediocrity , especially if your scheme is monochromatic . You hear quite a bit about " keying " colors . This simply means that a color transition should not be too sudden in small areas or in a small house or apartment . Two or more rooms opening off the same hall , or into each other , may be keyed in a number of ways . They may have the same wall color , but different furniture and accessories ; or color may be picked up in accessories alone . In keying colors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion , and contrast . Changing color values from light to dark or vice versa produces a sensation of contrast and movement . We all know hundreds of examples of colors which jump at you , because they are too contrasted . An educated color sense will see to it that this movement becomes a kind of rhythm , and this is another way of keying color in a room or in adjacent areas . Finally , you must be very aware of interest in working with color . All the rules in the world wo n't help you if you forget a few commonsense additions . Your interior must have life and individuality . tThe following are a few ways to get it . Create interest by varying your colors or hues ; by varying your values ; by varying intensities ; or by varying the intervals in which you place your color in a given area . Never contrast anything equally , if you want to avoid monotony . And , finally , when you feel that you are quite sure of yourself , introduce unexpected touches that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purple-pink , or magenta , against orange , the way the Persians and the Mexicans love to do .  | IT is perfectly possible , of course , to furnish a decorate a room , or a whole house , pleasingly and interestingly with acquainting yourself with any of the various period styles . But it easier ? and much more fun ? to do your choosing with a solid back-ground of knowledge of the styles which have been most serviceable the past , and which are appropriate and well adapted for use in hon today . Period styles are the decorative expressions of specific times and places . It is an excellent idea to familiarize yourself with all the more importperiods , even if your preference is very decidedly for one particular style . Certain designs and motifs keep on cropping up over the centuries , formed and adapted to the pattern of living of the moment . To know where they came from originally is to be able to understand the world of any given style ( however modified ) to you , today . Bear in mind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same research , more or less . Designs are rarely created out of thin air . Research is mer adapted to suit a given society , a national pocketbook , available suppli and a national temperament . What you see about you today in the ti of decorative furnishings is the result of a very long history of trial a error , of fashions which are the result of action and reaction . Know your periods , and you will have a professional understanding of the wh contemporary design picture , as well as that of the past . Decorative styles of any period grow naturally out of a definite w of life . Manners and customs control design . If you want to understand the best designs of the past ? and there were some horrors ? you shot  | get the feel of the society for whom the designers worked . Worry less about such details as whether it was Sheraton or Hepplewhite who designed chairs in straight lines or curves , or whether a claw-and-ball foot is the inevitable sign of a Chippendale chair . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain extent periods are thought of as contrasted with modern furniture and decoration . In what follows , the modern style is taken up after discussing the periods , in chronological order . If you prefer modern design , with its freedom from forms and details which are reminiscent of the past , you can choose your furniture and fabrics and accessories from a wide selection , outlined under " The Best of Today 's Modern " in this section , and under the appropriate headings in Part 5 . But if you are undecided as to your preference , you will find that knowledge of the high points in the history of interior design is helpful and stimulating . The periods have vital qualities . A well-designed and honestly made piece of furniture has a way of lasting ; so does an outstanding motif , a memorable color , or a notable combination of proportions . There are certain facts about styles and the combining of styles which you should have in mind before analyzing the periods separately . Avoid thinking of the periods as dead eras . Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up . It is not desirable ( and usually impossible ) for the average person to turn twentieth-century interiors into exact replicas , period in every detail . So look at each style to know how to modify it sympathetically to your own needs . Certain elements are usually just as practical and useful and beautiful now as they ever were . Others have historic interest or charm but are woefully unsuited to today 's living . If you are honest with yourself , you can spot rather easily the aspects which seem made for you . The period styles are available to you either in the shape of original antiques or in well-made reproductions . The backgrounds are usually something you create yourself , in the manner of the original . Your house is not a museum , so think of the utility of a period piece before anything else . Ask yourself , " Will this please me and the members of my family ? " Secondly , your period piece must have some intrinsic beauty , as well as that indefinable something called " charm " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antique or reproduction . It should be evident  | that not everything made in a given period was well designed . Only training your eye will tell you the difference . Look at all the details of a piece and then compare them with other similar pieces you have known . Close examination and comparison , plus a fair idea of the history and development of the decorative arts such as is outlined in sections to follow , will steer you right . Third comes a piece 's fitness for the position it will occupy in its new home , and its ability to mix with the surroundings . A typical Empire chair , however magnificent in its rich mahogany and gilded bronze mounts , will look a sorry sight in a dainty Adam music room . And the best Louis XV bombe commode looks vulgar in a New England interior filled with refined Salem-Sheraton furniture . It takes a much keener eye to select a good reproduction than it does a good antique . This is because so many manufacturers are prone to adapt and " improve " original models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailing . A reproduction which is not absolutely accurate and truthful to its original is not a reproduction at all , strictly speaking . If you know what a period piece should look like , the rest is easy . Once you have decided that you want one or more period pieces in your home , there are several ways of assimilating them . By far the easiest ( but also the most formal ) method is to assemble a room , or a series of rooms in one style , from one country . That is , you can do a French rococo room , which would be all Louis XV , or an English rococo room , which would probably be all Chippendale , or a German Neo-Classic room , which would be all Biedermeier . Another method , a slight variation of the first , is to mix pieces in a like style . That is , you can go right across national boundary lines and mix Adam , Hepplewhite , Sheraton , Louis XVI , and Italian , German , Austrian , Dutch , and Swedish Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time and were all variations of the Early Classic Revival style , scale , proportion , detailing , and color will all blend . This method and the single-period method both have the serious disadvantage of looking too self-conscious . The effect is arrived at by trying too hard , and it looks it , even if it is correct .  | A more human way of assembling period items is to do it in an evolutionary manner , the way it was done in homes all over the world for centuries . That is , mix the pieces of the period you especially like with pieces from the period immediately preceding it , and possibly some few pieces from the period immediately following . A less formal approach but one which requires vastly more skill than any of the others is the " no period " philosophy , which holds that a number of quite differing items , which may be poles apart stylistically , or in point of time , can yet be combined . What follows is designed to give the feeling of each period first from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national viewpoint . This is because all great styles are essentially international . A given style is then discussed first as it appears in its country of origin . Following sections take up the same style as it filtered into other countries . You will have much more understanding of periods if you think of them in this larger way , and this approach will help you do a more interesting job of decoration in your home . Periods are ordinarily arranged according to reigns or periods of office of the heads of government in various countries . It is a simplified method which gives you a frame of reference . Actually , styles in furniture and furnishings are always in a fluid state , and transitions from one period to another are never abrupt . Often one period is just a modification of an earlier period . And , even when there is a very emphatic change , it is almost always possible for you to trace a relationship to an earlier period , even though separated very considerably in point of time . As you look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style develops out of another . It will make your period study that much more interesting . Some styles and periods will undoubtedly attract you more than others . For instance , if you like intricate carving , rich woods , and a certain ornateness , but do n't want to sacrifice strength or stability to  | luxury , you will like the Chippendale style . If , on the other hand , you admire curves and grace and carving of riotous imagination , and you are willing to sacrifice some vigor for flights of charming fantasy , the Louis XV style is for you . These two styles developed at about the same time , and both are perhaps as popular with quite a number of people today as they ever were . Careful study of the pages which follow will help you know your periods well enough to select with a sure eye , not at random ; it will also help you to think about furniture and objects of art in terms of form or contour or weight , or any other of a number of attributes which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Consider each of the periods and see which appeals to you most for your home . Although the history of decoration goes back through the ages , and motifs from ancient times keep appearing and reappearing , the Renaissance is the first period which shows a recognizable relation to interiors as we think of them today . The early Italian Renaissance of the fifteenth century in Italy brought to the home new luxury and a personal , human touch which were largely lacking in the typical medieval or Gothic interior . But from today 's vantage point , early Renaissance furniture looks cumbersome and heavy and elementary in form and number of designs . The late Renaissance in sixteenth-century Italy and Spain , and the England of the early Tudors and Elizabeth , produced rooms which were more livable and more completely furnished . Innovations which made for comfort ? such as paneled walls , leaded glass windows , and chimney pieces ? were signs of an increasing preoccupation with the niceties of life . But the Renaissance , early or late , does not offer pieces which are suited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interiors as late as the 1920 's ) . Massive and ornate , Renaissance furnishings are wrong in scale and wrong in design for today 's average American interior . The baroque style , which reached its height in the seventeenth century , is the first real example of what we mean when we talk about a  | decorated interior . This is because decoration by that time had become a fine art . Designers began to think of the whole house as a unit . And they worked for a unified effect between the house , its setting , its structural lines , and its interior design . Even the smallest part was no longer hit or miss . If the net result was often too coldly correct from our modern point of view , it was nevertheless a kind of decoration which was a great step in the direction of intelligent planning . The baroque style grew out of the Renaissance . It originated in Italy . Baroque found expression in France under Louis XIV , and in England during the Jacobean and later Stuart reigns . Italian architects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia ; and Vienna became one of the great centers of baroque ideals in architecture and decoration . In Spain the baroque style reached a particularly rich , decorated degree of development ; and Spanish baroque , as a style , was carried by the Spanish to the New World , in modified form . Baroque was a style which was essentially concerned with palaces and churches . It was particularly well suited to absolute rulers , with unlimited funds , who lived a theatrical round of rigidly regimented court spectacles . Show was important ; comfort and convenience were not . Courts were the center of all social life , and court taste was the taste of authority . Formality was necessary above everything , and the homes of ordinary people were of little interest to an army of designers whose patrons were kings and princes , and a vast throng of courtiers , clustered around a number of autocratic rulers . Unless you are interested in the gradual evolution of ornament and furniture design , you may find yourself skipping over this seventeenthcentury period altogether . Like the Renaissance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1920 's . Jacobean lingers on in the design of some living room furniture ( badly adapted , and distorted ) found in the market today . But , along with a number of other period styles , baroque 's interest is more historic than sensible , as far as modern living is concerned . The style associated with Louis XIV , the Sun King , began about 1661 ( when he assumed control of the government ) , and was already radically changed before his death . It is a court style which is about as far removed as possible from modern ideas of living in the home , and its importance is chiefly historic . All the arts were influenced by the court ,  | and since France led the world in refinement and fashion , the architecture and decoration sponsored ( and even dictated ) by Louis XIV was of major interest to a number of countries . Louis XIV interiors and furniture were massive , sumptuous , pompous , and austere . Stucco and marble were favorite materials for rooms , and scale in everything was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated ones ? until late in the reign , and a court life accepted as a matter of course rooms which were cold enough to freeze the wine at the table of the king himself . There was no pretense at privacy or intimacy , for all rooms ? vast , symmetrical , and richly decorated ? opened one into another , without halls or corridors . Just as formal social life was regimented with fantastic exactitude and petty detail , furniture was as arbitrarily set in its position in a room . Even at this late date chairs at court were articles used only by the king , the queen , and the royal family . All others sat on furniture such as stools and hassocks , in varying degrees of discomfort . Louis XIV color and detailing were extraordinarily rich and brilliant , and precious materials such as silver were added to a profusion of gilt , bronze , tortoise shell , and ebony , in order to enhance an effect of overpowering splendor . Exotic objects from the Far East were popular ( an innovation which was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only were as lavish as the looms could produce but were further enriched with gold and silver threads . The important thing was that this was a truly national French style , and that it influenced the courts ? and therefore the design world ? of every other cultivated and polished society of the time . English rooms of this period differed little from Elizabethan , or Tudor interiors . Furniture was clumsy and squat , to accord with prevailing low ceilings . In general it was overcarved , and its variety was limited . It was furniture which was admirably suited to the interiors for which it was designed , but it does not find any place in the average contemporary American home , without architectural proportions or details to serve as an appropriate background . In its day , however , it lingered on in popularity , through the era of the Restoration of Charles II . As a style , it is mainly interesting to you today as the model ? together with Elizabethan designs ? on which the first settlers in America based their decoration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England saw a style of living that began to resemble more or less our modern ideas of comfort . Charles II had spent his youth in France and the Low Countries and had  | a Portuguese wife . Naturally enough , English tastes became a mirror for a number of foreign styles . A gay and luxurious court , returning after exile , in 166o , brought not only a new refinement to living but a new flamboyance , and what seems to us today an intolerable fondness for the most involved overlay of decoration and intricacy of carving . The luxury and intemperate extravagance of the baroque spirit which burst out in every direction , but largely in architecture ( in other countries ) , confined itself in England chiefly to furniture . Here the baroque style was preoccupied with a superficiality of details , and baroque great houses designed by Vanbrugh , such as Blenheim and Castle Howard , were ruthlessly appraised ( and generally condemned ) by contemporary public opinion . They were far from representative products of English sobriety and common sense . The ordinary town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its materials were simple brick , and it indulged in no flourishes or dramatic overstatements of scale . The typical house of the time was the restrained , dignified house designed by Inigo Jones or Christopher Wren , based on Italian classic architecture ; and its influence on later building in the American colonies was tremendous and long-lasting . A desire for a freer and gayer life after the Restoration immediately reflected itself in court furniture . The typical fine Charles II chair is caned on back and seat , for lightness . Its carving is less solid and its turnings are slenderer than Elizabethan and Jacobean furniture . Chair  | legs and table legs were commonly spiral-turned ( a favorite baroque device ) ; and japanning ( an imitation of lacquer ) was an exotic touch which contrasted well with the intricacy of marquetry , or inlay , an ornamental process which was given considerable impetus by refugee French artisans . " New " pieces of furniture which were introduced included items which seem very usual to us today : day beds , glass mirrors , bookcases , chests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases . Walnut was the accepted wood ( it permitted finer carving than oldfashioned oak ) , and veneer was common . The people 's furniture was something else again . Unimpressed by foreign influences and a markedly luxurious court society , most of England continued to be satisfied with furniture of oak , and simple applied moldings instead of veneer and marquetry . A new king and queen introduced innovations which were to make their name associated with a style which in many ways foreshadowed  | what we think of today as desirable elements of interior design . They ? or more particularly Mary ? sponsored designs which were a decided increase in refinement and simplicity . Color and form became more important than intricacy and dexterity of carving . As a matter of fact , carving was often conspicuous by its absence . The so-called Age of Walnut was at its height and that sophisticated wood was elaborately inlaid with various exotic , colored woods and other materials . A decided interest in simple curves served to balance a fondness for richness which sometimes threatened to produce an effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became acceptable to the people , a clear indication that the designs and the materials used were not too eccentric for popular consumption . Stylistically , there was naturally a persistent Dutch influence on all design ( William was called from Holland ) , and a secondary influence arrived from France . A third came from trade with the Far East which resulted , among other things , in a mania for china collecting ( Mary 's greatest enthusiasm ) , the use of lacquer ( either imported or domestic imitations ) , and the motif of a dragon claw holding a pearl , which is popularly supposed to be the origin of the familiar claw-and-ball foot in English furniture . The cabriole ( or curved ) leg originated about this time , and the high chest of drawers on legs , later called a highboy ( French , haut-bois . ) Hooded tops to case pieces , flat , arched aprons , and straight , cup-turned legs , braced with shaped stretchers , are some of the earmarks of furniture in the William and Mary manner , along with tall-back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petit point , following Mary 's devotion to needlework . And over it all was thrown as varied and as brilliant a wealth of color as English decoration has ever seen .  | What is " Early American " ? Early American , as a term , calls to mind familiar pictures of Pilgrim fathers wending their way to church from log cabins , or fighting Indian raids , or celebrating Thanksgiving . Unfortunately , most of our popular conceptions of this period are distorted and colored by pictorial misrepresentation . When you examine this period , try to separate the facts from the fancies , and though you may care nothing for dates and chronology , do n't confuse " early " with " late . " A lot of 185o furniture has somehow been classed as Early American , and it is just as well at the outset to get the facts straight . Cobbler 's benches , dry sinks , and water benches , for instance , were usually made after 1825 . Hooked rugs are not Colonial in date , but had their heyday in the 1860 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooked , braided , and rag rugs , commonly associated with Early American , as a style , were made around 1830 . Candlewick spreads date from the 182o 's ; and most crazy quilts from the 184o 's or 185o 's . " Spool " furniture , like the popular spool beds used today , is likewise a creation of the 185o 's , and one of the products of the beginnings of mass production . And the justly familiar comfortable Boston rocker dates from the 182o 's or later . This is not to say that these objects ca n't be used in a charming and successful way with certain Colonial types of furniture , but be sure to distinguish between a pleasant decorating job and an authentic interior of the period . These later home-made American products are certainly a part of the American scene , but remember they are most successfully used  | when they are placed in the right environment . Originally they were unpretentious , useful objects , generally designed for a simple rural setting . They look at their best now when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Characteristics . Though the Dutch , the French , the Swedes , and the Spanish made localized contributions to interior design in the early development of American domestic arts , the style which dominated all others along the eastern seaboard in the seventeenth century was definitely English . Almost up to the beginning of the eighteenth century , interior architecture and furniture followed medieval traditions , simplified by the absence of tools and materials and the necessities of a perilous and difficult existence . Houses , up and down the American East coast , were commonly simple , boxlike forms , one story high , first of one room ( usually only some twenty by fourteen feet ) , with a necessarily huge fireplace . The second stage added another room , duplicating the first , on the other side of the chimney . The whole thing was like the opened pages of a book . Gradually , lofts upstairs were turned into bedrooms , and , if more space was needed , a lean-to in back was added , creating the saltbox type of house which is still seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular with modern home-builders all over America . The people who settled the early colonies were plain , hardworking English people , and this simple type of house plan was so admirably suited to their needs that it continued well beyond the seventeenth century . The first furniture which was made in the American colonies reflected not only the lower-middle-class background of the majority of the settlers , but their provincialism as well . The amount of furniture and its variety was negligible in the average seventeenth-century American house . That had been the case in England , and the added complications and hardships of life in a new country did little to provoke any imaginative additions . Both furniture and decoration were more practical than beautiful . Lines were straight , and proportions though robust were scaled to fit prevailing small and cramped quarters . Solid wood and substantial construction was the norm in all interior fittings . Background . In the earliest homes , massive oak beams and plain white plastered walls were almost the universal practice , following the precedents of the typical Elizabethan interior reproduced from memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonies were commonly the Tudor casement type with diamond-shaped , leaded panes . Motifs . Since design was based on late medieval and Elizabethan patterns , motifs were taken over and simplified from more elaborate examples found in England . Geometric panels were uniformly used , and ornament was commonly carved , or applied . Colors . Color was vigorous and rich , in spite of all the restrictions and hardships which a primitive life entailed . Much oak furniture was painted either black , brick red , or yellow , or contrasts of both . In addition , fabrics at the windows , on pad cushions , or surrounding a bed , combined with domestic imitations of Oriental rugs to add glowing color to the plainest interior . Furniture . The first and the earliest form of furniture which craftsmen in America were commissioned to produce was variations of a box . The chest was the first receptacle , the first wardrobe , and the first seat ( as it has been for centuries in Europe ) . It had the further advantage of portability in time of Indian raids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the other the Connecticut , employed incised carved decoration and were used as blanket or dower chests . These chests increasd their usefulness , as the period progressed , with the addition of one or more drawers . Chests finally achieved real service when they were placed on a  | frame , later becoming the highboy or tall chest , which eliminated bending and stooping . The piece called the court cupboard was a more important and impressive part of the better and more spacious seventeenth-century American interiors . Used for storage and ( incidentally ) for the display of family silver , pottery , and porcelain , it followed closely Tudor and Jacobean models and was similarly heavy and clumsy . Space conservation was the norm in these first American interiors .  | Small rooms dictated a pattern of few units and a concentration on dualpurpose furniture . Thus , stools were very popular because they were easily moved , took up little room , and could be used for seating or , as a table , for eating and serving . A form of chair-table was used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the back arm . Standing upright , it served as a chair ; with the top down , it was large enough to serve for a family dinner . Space-saving also developed a type of bed frame which folded flat against the wall during the day , side curtains folding over it in some attempt at both concealment and elegance . Tables were greatly varied in size . The largest was the trestle type , with a demountable top , which was uncommon because its size presupposed a larger room than was usual in the average home . The so-called " tavern " table was more useful because of its small size . It was generally rectangular , contained one or more drawers in its apron , and stood on four turned legs , braced with stretchers . In between , as to size , were a large gate-leg table ( which commonly stood in the center of the room ) , with two leaves which collapsed when not in use , and a medium-sized butterfly table , which got its name from the shape of the supports which held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as in England ) by the head of the household or an important personage . The Brewster and the Carver chairs ( named after New England governors ) were executed in many variations . They were made of turned spindle construction , in contrast to the heavy and often grotesque wainscot chair , which used a solid panel construction . A more comfortable form of chair was the socalled " Cromwellian " which was low , smaller , lighter , and comfortably upholstered on seat and back . At the very end of the century certain sophisticated forms began to appear , in reflection of English styles . These reproduced , in provincial form , such established models as the flat-topped highboy with trumpetturned legs , a severely simple veneered slant-front desk an low , stubby " turnip " feet , and caned chairs ( and even day beds ) , with carved , scrolled cresting and stretchers . All of these forms corresponded to popular models in the William and Mary , and Charles II manner . A certain number of chairs added more comfort by using tall backs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing chairs , upholstered in silks or velvets , were the acme of luxury . Though oak was the commonest material used in furniture of the first century of colonization , any other native wood might be used , if it served a purpose . Ash , hickory , chestnut , pine , and maple were also used ,  | separately , or combined with each other . ( As much of this early furniture was painted , variation of wood-graining was often of little or no importance . ) At the turn of the century , a few examples of native lacquer attempted to imitate the English and Chinese examples which had been introduced into English furniture by Mary 's craze for Oriental importations . Materials . Fabrics in the early colonies were divided between American-made products , spun and woven primarily for their usefulness rather than their beauty , and rich and elegant fabrics imported from England . Homespuns , of the type still made today , had an unaffected charm and sincerity of their own , with their sober , solid colors . And for a more brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and damasks could be had from abroad . " Turkey work " ( an imitation of rare Oriental rugs ) was done in the colonies and used more for table covers than as floor coverings . The rococo style of the first half of the eighteenth century is first and foremost a feminine style . It is all curves and grace . It is capricious and imaginative , and the variety of its designs is inexhaustibly intriguing . It is the style above all others which combines elegance with comfort , and its usefulness is as great today as it ever was . That it was originally created for a gay , brilliant ( and extravagant ) society which bears little  | resemblance to twentieth-century manners , and our way of living does not detract from the beauty and charm of this style , nor from its convenience . Now , as then , the most opulent exaggerations were designed for an extremely small minority . The average person demanded , and got , beauty of line , soundness of construction , and fresh originality of treatment , minus all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needlessly involved , even when it is found on court pieces . The key to the style is the continuous undulating curves of all its lines , its complete lack of symmetry , and its preoccupation with comfort and convenience . Its most characteristic seat ? the bergere ? sums up the period . It is a piece of furniture which is low and deep , heavily upholstered , and supremely luxurious ; its curves flow one into the other without effort ; and its outline is pleasingly irregular . If , in choosing rococo pieces , you steer clear of items which seem to you excessively rich or overcomplicated in decoration , or too involved in the multiplicity of their curves , you will be on the right track . The rococo style swept Western Europe and its colonies , and it took a variety of different forms as it acquired the characteristics of various nations . Center most of your attention first on France , however , since that country was the capital of world culture of the period . All the design world ? including such varied cultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the American colonies ? looked to the French court for inspiration and workmanship . In many ways you will find that French rococo is a style more suited to today 's interiors than the rococo of other countries , because it is more subtle and more restrained . The rococo style never took hold to any degree  --  except in applied decoration and furniture - in England or the American colonies .  | Germany and Austria mingled and confused baroque with rococo , and went France one better in fondness for extravagant fantasy . Impoverished Italy worked miracles in painted disguises . All of these expressions and variations of the rococo style are in popular use today . The Regence ( not to be confused with the Regency style in England ) was a transitional period in France between Louis XIV and Louis XV , and covers the years during which Philip of Orleans , the king 's uncle , was regent before Louis XV became of age . The style of the Regence naturally includes traces of the coarseness of Louis XIV scale and design , plus a foretaste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new style were developed from the old , and many of the characteristics of what is thought of as trade-marks of the rococo taste ( such as the love of Far Eastern subjects ) were already apparent in the seventeenth century . Characteristics . The rococo style of Louis XV had one aim : to create a suitable background for a witty , polished , and relatively informal society . Everything was contrived for intimacy , coziness , gaiety , and convenience . Its common characteristics ( there were a number of substyles ) are an intense dislike of straight lines , a delight in caprices and surprises , an inequality of outline , and a complete lack of symmetry . Rococo ornaments can not be divided into equal parts by a straight line down the A Louis XV silver chocolate pot is a fine example of motion and asymmetric detailing in a minor accessory .  | middle . At its height in France it is one of the most fanciful and most delightful of all period styles . Today , it is admired for the same qualities which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , it has the distinct advantage in modern homes of being scaled to rooms of moderate or small dimensions . Its range is practically limitless , so that it is possible to find a rococo piece for almost any type of modern interior , except , perhaps , the most severely " pure " contemporary room . Court pieces are usually too splendid for the average taste , but there is a whole mass of furniture , in a great variety of woods , which goes all the way from strict formality to the charmingly casual , regional adaptations which we now refer to as French Provincial . There is rococo material for the most sophisticated town house or apartment ; and there is an abundance of the same in its provincial form for the house in the country or the farm . Background . All rules of classic architecture were pushed as far aside as possible in the rococo period . The rococo style was a revolt against the cold impersonality of the great open spaces of typical baroque seventeenth-century palaces . In general , large apartments ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country house came into its own . It was the age of the salon , and the influence of women was paramount . The salon was for receptions , but there were smaller rooms for relaxation with friends , and there were new conveniences and refinements ? like dressing rooms and even bathrooms . To enhance the brilliancy and gaiety of every gathering , there were as many windows as possible , and ceilings were whitened to reflect the light . A lavish use of mirrors opened up perspectives and added even more brightness . Projections were reduced , and  | spaces and openings were enclosed in a series of curves of infinite and complex variety . Corners were rounded , and right angles of any kind were disguised or done away with as much as possible . Paintings , furniture , and objects were all thought of as part of an integrated whole . Therefore architectural moldings frequently repeated ( or harmonized with ) the moldings of the furniture placed against them , or vice versa . The most typical French rococo room was paneled in carved wood . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their scale was smaller , more human , and above all more comfortable than rooms of any previous period . Mantels were lower and scaled to human proportions , floors were parquet instead of marble , and anything solemn or grand in the way of ornament was discarded . Motifs . Since the patronage of rococo designers was predomi- nantly feminine , there was a marked preference for romantic motifs , or for familiar objects romanticized . The country , and country life , animal life , and the exotic flavor of foreign countries were favorite subjects . Commonest motifs were : dainty wreaths of roses ; fluttering ribbons ; a pierced and jagged scallop shell , a bulbous cartouche ; an acanthus reduced and attenuated to sprays and tendrils ; flowers everywhere , in bouquets , baskets , or in twos and threes ; whole palm trees ; doves in couples ; and laurel and olive branches twined with flowers . Symbols of love were : cupids , bows , quivers , blazing torches , and hearts in pairs . The pastoral vogue was represented by such objects as : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat , a wicker basket , and the turtle-dove cage . Other motifs were : instruments of music , hunting and fishing equipment , and symbols of the sciences . There were no war trophies . And there was a whole array of motifs from China and other parts of the East , such as Turks , pashas , sultanas and odalisques , playful monkeys , as well as the more familiar little fanciful Chinamen , so often reproduced today . The very definite taste for things Chinese ( Chinoiserie ) was encouraged by the Marquise de Pompadour , mistress of the king , whose many interests included the Compagnie des Indes , a corporation set up to enlarge trade with the Far East . Colors . Rococo colors in France were light and gay . White , with gilt moldings , was the favorite for walls . This was varied by citron , light green , and soft pink . Ceilings . were often " skies , " filled with cupids or birds or butterflies . A certain amount of naturalistic color was added by painted panels over doors ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little room for the hanging of pictures ) . In addition , color was supplied by some painted furniture done in pale or strong hues such as oyster , mint-green , or cerulean blue , as well as vivid combinations such as red and black , green and gold , and striking yellow and gold . Lacquer , in the Chinese manner but done in France ( the so-called Vernis-Martin pieces ) , appeared in black , yellow , emerald , lapis-lazuli blue , and brown . All of these colorful accents were supplemented by the finest silk fabrics ? damasks , velvets , and brocades ? usually in purple , reds , golden yellow , or bright green . Add to this , tapestry and needlework upholstery , and the effect was bound to be vivid , fresh , and brilliant , even without the glowing costumes worn by men as well as women of the period . Nothing is more mistaken than to assume that French rococo colors were insipid or candy-box . Furniture . Louis XV furniture is above all perfectly adapted to  | human needs . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is movable for ease in conversation , its variety is infinite , and it is supremely comfortable , springs having been invented in this period . There are tables for every conceivable purpose , light and practical , and beautiful . The chest is replaced by the chest of drawers , or commode . Bookcases were the vogue , and there were tall ( about five feet ) , slender chests , of seven drawers called chiffoniers , or semaniers ( from semain , the week ) , to hold small objects like scarfs . It was the period of such gay but useful pieces as the table with pierced openings for Dutch bulbs or flowering plants , later called a jardiniere . There were dual-purpose tables with lids which slipped off , to be used when eating or writing in bed , and there were writing tables of extraordinary variety for sentimental exchanges of notes .  | The commode ( like the bergere ) is one of the most characteristic pieces of furniture of the period because it gave the biggest opportunity to work out curving outlines and rich surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the designer had a mind for it , were extravagant console tables with elaborate pierced bases , generally attached by bolts to the wall and requiring only nominal support for their marble tops . There was an almost endless variety of tables for frivolous or serious purposes , gaming tables , and little work-tables of all shapes and sizes . Toilet tables were invented in this period and took their important place in an era when the bedroom was the reception room for half the day . Conversation was an art , and to further it chairs were both portable and comfortable , deeply upholstered , and nicely varied in shape . Arms on all chairs were commonly low and set back to receive the enormous hoop skirts of the period . Sofas and chaises longues were similarly overstuffed and curvaceous . Beds were of three types , with either a flat tester or a crown from which draperies fell to enclose the bed and its occupant at night . There is a notable sense of continuity in the design of French rococo furniture . Construction and decoration are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat and a seat is continued by an arm into the curve of a back . Though no furniture can be structurally asymmetric , rococo decoration is planned , as much as possible , to give that impression . Woods are richly varied in important furniture centers . Mahogany , moderate in price from i 750 on , was actually in use twenty-five years before . Satinwood and amaranth ( a violet variety of mahogany ) are commonly used , and great range of exotic and expensive woods are employed for marquetry . The wood of chairs may be left natural and waxed or be painted one or more shades ( as listed above ) or be gilded . Caning , if there is any , is commonly blended in with plain or painted finishes . Characteristic ormolu ( gilded bronze ) ornaments on French rococo pieces are not placed merely for luxurious ornamentation . Little gilded boots , for instance , are added to legs for strength , and corner and lid decorations are added to protect exposed joints from damage . Stretchers , as a structural necessity , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to do this ) , and excellence of cabinetmaking takes care of stresses and strains in a less obvious way . Materials . The costly coverings were tapestries , usually done for suites of furniture . These might be done in gros or petit point . Other  | popular coverings were velvets and damasks , usually in crimson , green , yellow , or blue . Taffetas were used on summer furniture , and slipcovers were made of painted Chinese silk . Satin was much used , plain , striped , brocaded , or embroidered , as well as more serviceable mixtures , like brocatel . Moquette was a cheaper version of cut velvet for use in the winter . And in the summer , painted or printed cottons were used , or the newly fashionable chintzes ( sponsored by the Marquise de Pompadour ) . Caned chairs for summer use might come with or without cushions , which might be of leather . And leather was common on dining and writing chairs . Curtains might be of the finest thin silks , or plain or embroidered muslin . Matching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and upholstered pieces might all be made up in the same fabric ( an idea which we think of as part of contemporary decoration ) . Characteristics . French Provincial , a purely modern American term , is accurate if you use it to cover all the products made in the provinces of France during the late seventeenth , eighteenth , and early nineteenth centuries . French Provincial furniture is not provincial in the sense that it is always unsophisticated . And it is not confined just to Louis XV styles , as some people seem to think . It reflects court styles , and court furniture of each period has to be studied before you can understand provincial examples of the same taste . Motifs and designs in fashion at court took a long time to disseminate to the country , and they often appeared there in distorted or simplified versions hard to recognize unless you keep an original model firmly in mind . Though inspired by the court , provincial furnishings always reflected a practicality and sturdiness which were natural to a people who were close to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usefulness . These are the features which endear French Provincial , as a style , to present-day Americans . Its peculiar mixture of urbane and bucolic moods makes it adaptable to city or country , and it mixes well with a great number of similar simple styles , such as our own Early American . It can , of course , be used in a setting by itself , or it can be mixed with more sophisticated pieces of the same rococo period , or with styles which came later , such as Louis XVI , for instance . In its own era , it was frequently used in the city as a nostalgic evocation of the country ( little rush-bottomed chairs were often found even in fine Parisian houses ) .  | Motifs . The ornament used on provincial furniture is always a mixture of rococo and purely local motifs , usually charmingly confused , but sometimes ugly and clumsy . Thus , the Bretons liked balusters and spindles in their pieces , whereas their neighbors , the Normans , went in for more grace and beauty of proportion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motifs common to many different locations were baskets of flowers , hearts , and olive branches . Many of these were executed in a masterly way ; naive simplicity is not always inevitable in provincial furniture . Furniture . Country rococo furniture in France uses solid instead of veneered woods , and graceful yet vigorous carving instead of inlay . The woods used are naturally those native to each province . Oak is used especially in Normandy and Brittany , and walnut in central and southern France . Wild cherry went into chairs , little tables , and secretaries ; beech was commonly used for pieces which received hard service , such as dining chairs . The most popular fruitwoods were : cherry , almond , apricot , pear , and chestnut . Their fresh , vibrant color lends added charm to much provincial furniture , though they are not necessarily a sign of provincial origin in every case . One of the greatest differences between court and provincial furniture was a liking for paneled pieces in the country . Great wardrobes , or  | armoires , were always given a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were usually banished from any important Parisian room , or given to the servants . Their variety was enormous , though they were only of two types ? either in one or two parts . They were large because they were designed to hold much of the family 's household wealth in the shape of linens , clothes , silver , and eating equipment . Most Louis XV armoires have arched and molded pediments , and an important motif is usually centered on each paneled door . Another typical provincial piece was the buffet , which was similar to the armoire because it also came in one or two sections and carried many of the same moldings and carved ornament . The upper section ? usually set back ? held copper , pewter , and colorful pottery in open shelves placed between closed cupboards . Like the armoires , buffets came in a great number of different styles and variations of form and detail . Provincial commodes were generally made of fruit woods and were exuberant in their mixture of serpentine fronts , cabriole legs , and strong and profuse carving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood or marble tops and with a wealth of dramatic hardware . Little rush-seated chairs ( called fauteuils de Capuchine ) were other items uniquely of the provinces , which were accepted then ( and now ) for their charm as well as their inherent serviceability . They usually had low seats , stubby legs , and a variety of plain backs , of which the simplest was the characteristic ladder-back . A loveseat , or canape , was commonly made up of two or more such matching backs . Though technically useless today , a few provincial pieces which were functional in their time are still placed in present-day interiors in the provincial manner . One example would be the panetiere , to hold bread , which looked like a cage because of its construction of spindles , and which stood on another low piece , like a commode , or was attached to the wall . Another such item is the wall fountain , often of copper or pewter , which today has its bowl filled with leaves or flowers . And there are a number of shelves of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessories which add much of the flavor of a truly provincial interior , if used with discretion . Materials . Provincial fabrics are particularly fresh , bright , charming in texture and color . Printed cotton ( toiler de Jouy ) , or woodblocks , heavy linens , serges , and quilted cottons are all suitable for use in interiors of this style .  | If your taste is for a kind of sophisticated moderation in furniture design , and if you pay attention to sound structure and solid usability , the chances are that you will find much to interest you in the furnishings of the first half of the eighteenth century in England . It is a period which covers , in roughly fifty years , some of the simplest and some of the most ornate furniture ever created . Its variety need not be confusing , however , if you realize that all of these variations are forms of a perceptible progression and evolution toward lighter and more functional cabinet work . There is definitely a kind of dignified elegance about all this furniture , and it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it which suggests relaxed informality , and if that is your primary aim , it is better to consider another period . In any event , you will want to be familiar with the styles of these fifty years . The Queen Anne style develops naturally out of the changes ad- vanced by William and Mary , away from rectangular and heavy designs of earlier styles toward curves and greater lightness . It is a transitional period from the seventeenth to the eighteenth century , and though Anne 's reign was short , the style persisted for many years and leaped the ocean to the colonies in America where it had a fantastic and long-lived success . Special tricks of turning or carving are not found in Queen Anne furniture , and the whole emphasis is on quiet dignity . Furniture is lower and generally smaller in scale . Secretaries , for instance , are slim and often quite tiny , even by modern standards . Much of this furniture relies on beautiful woods and simple contours for its effect , and for that reason it is quite suitable for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reign of Anne introduced the first real breath of modernity to English interior design . Homes were finer , interiors were more spacious , and furniture was more plentiful and markedly more comfortable . As a style , " Queen Anne " was never ponderous ; often it introduced gay and whimsical touches , and exotic notes resulting from trade with the Continent , the Near East , and the Orient . There were a number of little tables in use for the first time ? it was an age of gambling and tea-drinkingand highboys and lowboys were typical . Chair backs are lower and " spooned " to follow the contour of the sitter . The prevailing wood is walnut , though some furniture is painted white or another color and gilded . Perpendicular legs are " out " and cabriole legs are " in . " Fresh color is everywhere . Upholstery in colorful damasks , brocades , velvets , and needlework is often made more informal by the use of chintz .  | Characteristics . In general , the style of the first two Georges was a natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of increasing weight and richness of detailing . George I , who came to the English throne from Hanover , did n't understand the English language or the English people and did nothing to change even the style of the court . George II and his subjects relied heavily on architects as decorators . William Kent was the first of these to design a whole house , inside and out , and his furniture creations were often weighty and ugly . Much of the best furniture under the Georges ( at least up to about 1740 ) is too pretentious for modern use . It is likely to be cumbersome , and its decoration is often taken up with such grotesque motifs as satyr masks and gigantic lion heads and paws . About the middle of the century , however , several divergent styles were popular simultaneously , and this is the phase of the period which most people think of when they say " Georgian . " This was the age of Chippendale , and the Gothic , Chinese , and French rococo fashions . Background . Throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting was a series of rooms designed very tightly around an original scheme . Doors , windows , fireplaces , and ceilings were carefully worked out as a unit . Proportions were stressed , and walls were broken by a dado with large rectangular panels above . This paneling was generally painted white or dove gray or olive green , picked out with gold .  | Cupboards were let into the walls ? generally to display china which was increasing as a collectible ? and windows were tall in proportion to their width . Against such a simple background , chimney pieces were greatly varied . Many were clumsy and heavy , whether in marble or wood . The majority which were acceptable to present-day tastes were classical in design . There were also " cabinetmakers ' fireplaces " later in the century , which were elaborately ornate and which were usually executed in carved wood in the Chinese or rococo style . ( Mantels of all these types are available today either in their original antique form or in reproduction . ) Floors were generally oak , with marble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptional background would be a wallpaper room or one hung in silk . By the middle of the eighteenth century fabulously expensive Chinese papers were sometimes used in one all-Chinese room , but it is important to realize that it might be one out of forty others . Chinoiserie , as a style , was not universally popular in England . It was considered a decided novelty and an all-Chinese room was thought of as an extravagance in questionable taste . A certain amount of flock paper ( in imitation of cut velvet ) was also popular . Silk , if it was used at all , was stretched tight over a whole wall , or in center panels only , if the wall was paneled . Motifs . The motifs of the first half of the century in England cover such a vast range that it is almost meaningless to list them . In general , they may be labeled baroque in the first third of the century , and Gothic , Chinese , or rococo thereafter . Chippendale , for instance , had eliminated all Chinese and Gothic influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1762.  | Colors . Until the coming of the classic revival ( after the middle of the century ) colors were uniformly full-blooded and rich , except as backgrounds . For some inexplicable reason English tastes admired soft grayed walls ? like olive green ? above all . Upholstery fabrics were unlimited as to color , though dark red , green-blue , and plum were particular favorites , in about that order . Lacquer , in red , black , green , or white and gold , was popular throughout the whole period , and a certain amount of color was added by some use of wallpaper . Oriental rugs were used extensively , upstairs and down ; or domestic rugs of needlework were sometimes used instead . Furniture . The early Georgian period falls into two divisions : the transitional period when the same designs were used for walnut or mahogany ; and the so-called Chippendale period . This last era is sometimes called the Age of Mahogany because that wood was almost universal in its application . The fine grain and the tough fiber of mahogany was the medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As it came out , it was a style in which design , method of execution , and material were extraordinarily well suited each to the other . The chairs of this period arc unexcelled for sheer perfection of craftsmanship , mastery of tools and wood , and a discriminating adaptation of a confusing diversity of outside influences . Practically the only forms of decoration were carv- ing and applied frets . If you have an eye for furniture construction , this period will be endlessly interesting to you . Rooms of the first half of the eighteenth century in England were very sparsely furnished according to our twentieth-century standards , and the arrangement of furniture was very formal . Chairs were usually ranged along the walls , and each movable piece had its exact , appointed place . ( The tendency in working with the Georgian period today is to do just the reverse , and crowd a room full of objects till the effect is often overrich and stuffy . ) Georgians liked their precious objects few in number and dramatically displayed . The reverse was true , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sitting rooms , where tables and stands were littered with a haphazard collection of miscellaneous curiosities . Legs in furniture were at first cabriole , either with a simple pad foot , or a claw-and-ball foot , with fairly simple carving on the knee . About 1730 or 1740 , straight legs , plain , reeded , or pierced in the Chinese manner , were popular variations . These chairs started out at first with upholstered backs and only gradually came around to using all kinds of open-work splats . English chair backs are a study in themselves , and the transition from the solid splat of Queen Anne to the intricate , fancy trellis work of a Chippendale chair is a very gradual one , if logical . The best way to appreciate it is to compare a series of English chairs from 1700 to 1750 . Chair-makers in any country are always in the vanguard of new ideas , and innovations crop up in their shops before they do anywhere else . So experimentation in varieties of chair backs is a hallmark of this age , like many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin- sense elimination , on the part of the cabinetmaker , resulted in a great number of pieces of excellent furniture . ( There is a lot of difference between drawings and finished result , in cases of actual furniture which can be traced directly back to a published design . ) Chippendale is a useful label for a type of furniture designed by Chippendale 's contemporaries ( many of the designs in the first edition , published in 1754 , were not Chippendale 's own , but the work of his " ghosts , " Lock and Copland ) and his book , usually called by its shortened title , the Director , is really important today as a compilation of the most fashionable styles of the time . Chippendale himself listed these as designs in the Gothic , Chinese , and Modern Taste . Chippendale was really more of an influence than an actual producer , though the rare work which is known to have come from his workshop is very highly regarded today . His genius lay in adaptation . He gathered a lot of disparate ideas ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some classicisms ? and gave them practical , commercial expression . He improved on foreign styles structurally , and he bettered them artistically ? at least to Anglo Saxon tastes . His ornamentation might come from a number of very different sources , but his contour and structure were purely English . As a prime example in point , compare Chippendale 's bombe commodes with their French inspiration . In order of appearance , Chippendale chair furniture may be classified fairly easily . First came an " English " phase , when the cabriole leg , the claw foot , the broad back , and the big " Dutch " seat were borrowed from chairs of an earlier period . Innovations are a square-top back in a chair ( versus the hoop back of the typical Queen Anne or early Georgian counterpart ) , seats that are angled instead of being rounded , and an elimination of " spooning " in backs . Next came the " Gothic " phase , full of pointed arches and quatrefoils . And then the " Chinese , " with its pagoda motifs . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavish with shells and rococo fantasy . These vogues followed each other at very short intervals , and in the end they all ran concurrently , and often all on the same piece of furniture . Only Chippendale could throw together such a dissimilar group of contradictory themes ( even including classic motifs ) and make the result look coherent and even logical . Though Chippendale is commonly regarded as being primarily a genius at designing chairs , his list is comprehensive enough for most needs : chairs , stools , settees , sofas , day beds , beds , tables , chests , chests  | of drawers , chests-on-chests , highboys , lowboys , cabinets , secretaries , desks , writing tables , bookcases , cupboards , dining tables , sideboard tables , wardrobes , clothes presses , console cabinets , or commodes , pedestals , candlestands , wine-coolers , firescreens , hanging shelves , mirrors , and clocks . What are the virtues and the faults of this furniture style ? At its best it is more elegant , and more flexible than the work of cabinetmen of preceding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could afford to be elastic . It is furniture which not only looks substantial but is , and it is likely to be as strong today as it ever was , because it is structurally sound . At its worst it has a tendency toward redundancy of ornament and a fondness for sheer eccentricity of outline or decoration . Fortunately , the innate reserve of the British saw to it that not many such pieces were accepted even in their own day , and even fewer of them find their way down the long road to a modern market . From the modest , utilitarian beginnings of seventeenth-century American interiors there gradually , almost imperceptibly , developed more sophisticated homes composed of rooms filled with furniture and objects of art which rivaled , in many cases , the best work of England . American furniture of this period ? based first on Queen Anne models and then on Georgian ? had distinctive features of its own , even though it was inevitably influenced by what had gone before in the mother country . Not all the colonists were of English extraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural that American styles before the Revolution looked for inspiration to the best products of London cabinetmakers . Many American artisans had learned their trade in England , and the best design books which provided inspiration were English . Under the circumstances , it is somewhat surprising that the result was a style of decoration and furniture which was so distinctly American . An important point to remember in understanding American furnishings of this period is to realize that there was a natural time lag of approximately twenty-five or thirty years which separated the fashionable court styles of England from their adaptations in the New World . For instance , Queen Anne , as a style in America , covers roughly the second quarter of the eighteenth century , not the first , as in England . It was not  | till much later that any style ran concurrently in America as well as in England or France . It took time for court fashion to filter from London to the English provinces , and it took correspondingly longer for it to jump the Atlantic . Keep this fact in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne or American Chippendale . Point number two to remember is that American furniture , from the eighteenth century on , developed distinctly regional traits , in addition to purely national ones . An astonishing variation of taste occurred between such comparatively nearby cities as Boston and New York , or New York and Philadelphia . Boston ? and New England in general ? was devoted to extreme delicacy and simplicity in furniture . Connecticut was addicted to naive ornamentation executed in simple , native woods , such as cherry . New York furniture was masculine , generous in proportion , and vigorous in outline and detailing , as would be expected from a community which had always felt a strong Dutch influence . Philadelphia was the only center which leaned heavily on the designs of Chippendale and his contemporaries . The Director was not only imported and read by purely local cabinetmakers , it was published in a Philadelphia edition as well . Its impact was tremendous , and the furniture called Philadelphia Chippendale has not been misnamed . These regional differences add much of the variety and special charm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all early American furniture is its distinctively personal quality . It was the product of a number of rugged individualists who stamped their furniture with their own design quality , regardless of whether or not it was actually labeled by one maker or another . It is perfectly possible to identify , with some certainty , many American-made pieces of furniture by purely stylistic differences associated with the work of a number of different famous cabinetmen . Among the names to remember as symbols of the best workmanship in eighteenthcentury America are such individuals as : Savery , Gostelowe , Tufts , and Randolph in Philadelphia ; the Goddards and the Townsends in Newport ; Frothingham in Massachusetts ; and Chapin in Connecticut . If you like English furniture of the early eighteenth century , you may find that you like American products in the same general style even better . American furniture has all the vigor and structural honesty of English furniture of the same design , plus the very considerable added virtue of unerring discrimination ? a kind of perfection by process of elimination . If you are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds it a little ornate to fit in with your simpler tastes in interiors , American furniture of this period is for you . American cabinetmakers and their clientele wanted lightness , restraint , and grace , without all the elaboration of carving and often monumental scale found in English Georgian furnishings in the grand manner . You will like , also , the friendly , personal look of early American furniture , in contrast to similar English and Continental products . Generally , it is the kind of furniture which you can welcome into the most unpretentious home , where its innate dignity will add a note of elegance without being stuffy or pretentious . Because it is comparatively uncomplicated by excessive carving or decorative ornament , it lends itself well to reproduction , and there are a great many copies of excellent models now on the market . Characteristics . A growing solidity and concentration of towns and cities along the eastern seaboard and increasing wealth based on commerce prepared the way for a number of rich communities , which at last were able to support a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Continent . In the South , wealthy planters were even closer in their ties with the mother country and more English in their tastes than New Englanders . North and South , the colonies began to attract a new group of artisans trained in the best traditions of architecture and cabinetwork , as well as in the minor decorative arts , and though a certain amount of importing was always done , native cabinetmen , in particular , were increasingly proud of their innovations . Customers , more and more , were " buying American " in preference to anything else . This was for two reasons : first , because native craftsmen were quick to adapt London models to the special tastes and conditions of life in the new world ; second , because the freight costs on importations were almost prohibitively expensive . Background . The Wren-Georgian style of paneling was copied extensively from English examples and design books in both the North and the South in the American Queen Anne and American Georgian periods . It was a simplified version , in most cases , to accord with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were larger and lighter ( the sash window was new ) , especially in the South , and devoted to specific purposes , such as eating , sleeping , and entertaining , in comfortable contrast to the first tiny all-purpose rooms of the American seventeenth century . As the eighteenth century advanced into the socalled Chippendale period , architectural details become more elaborate ;  | intricate carving appears around the chimney piece ; and stucco decoration was often used to decorate an otherwise plain , flat ceiling . Most of these architectural designs were " lifted , " with some changes and adaptations , from the design handbooks of well-known London architects , whose publications were extensively followed in all the different colonies from New England to the Carolinas . The rococo style in architecture is extremely rare in America and is confined almost entirely to Philadelphia homes of the most elaborate kind . Allowing for a more modest scale than was common in the great palatial houses of Georgian England , American interiors ( up to the time of the early Republic ) compare very favorably with the best which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls . A second type of room used wallpaper , from cornice to baseboard or ending at a dado molding . Paneling was always painted , often in strong tones ( especially in the South ) of deep , rich reds , dusty pink , pumpkin , blue , blue-green , or green , or in chalk white . In the South ( in Virginia , for instance ) graining in imitation of exotic woods or marble was also attempted .  | Motifs . In general , all the motifs used in England were repeated in the colonies , in both interior architecture and furniture . However , bizarre or eccentric fashions which sometimes cropped up in English products were not acceptable . And , of course , the more obviously palatial ornaments which belonged to a more splendid and ostentatious society had no place and no popularity in any of the American colonies , even those " closest " to England , the great houses of Virginia and the Carolinas . Colors . Americans liked full-blooded color , and in the South , especially , they went in for stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallpapers were almost entirely imported , as were most accessories , such as ceramics and rugs . Colors in these items naturally were identical with the prevailing fashion in their country of origin ( see England and France ) . New England , particularly , was fond of mixtures of colors : mustard yellow , cranberry red , a soft blue , and olive green . Tan-brown and beige , as well as white , were also favorites . The South admired deeper , richer colors in their walls and frequently used shades like mulberry ( called Palace mulberry at Williamsburg ) . Furniture . The complex intricacies of Charles II furniture never caught on with any degree of success in a plainer colonial society , and such examples as were made were largely confined to tall caned-back chairs and day beds ( which resembled more what we would call chaises longues today ) . The Queen Anne style , in contrast , was enormously popular in America , because of its clean lines and its emphasis on simplicity and beauty of wood , uncomplicated by too much carved ornament . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or  | reproduced today are made in this elegant yet modest manner . As Queen Anne merged into Georgian , carving began to appear in bold motifs , sparingly placed , such as a cockleshell , carved in solid wood . American furniture never indulged in some of her English cousins ' fondness for the grotesque , and you will find no masks and satyrs in Colonial furniture . The popularity of Queen Anne as a furniture style continued well beyond the first signs of popularity of the rococo spirit in America , as found principally in Philadelphia . The slightly bombastic fashions of George I and George II seemed too out of character with the comparatively simple way of life that people were leading , even in wealthy key cities such as Boston , Newport , New York , Philadelphia , and Charleston . The American cabinetmaker always relied for his effect on line and rhythm of design , and sheer beauty of unadorned woods , before he began to consider carving and ornament . He scarcely ever became carried away with superfluity of decoration . This is why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America , and why it became translated into the Chippendale rococo manner without too much transition , as had been the case in England . The highboy and the lowboy ? already out of fashion in England by r 725 ? were particularly popular and became typically American forms , either in the simplest Queen Anne style or later , as they appeared in the magnificent and elaborate , rococo-carved Philadelphia examples . A highboy was always accompanied by a matching lowboy , orginally , and if they are now found separately , it is because they have become split up at one time or another by family sales or division of property , through wills and such , or by gifts . There are few designs which can safely be called truly American , but the monumental and ornate Philadelphia highboy is one which has no counterpart in English furniture . Another purely American form of this period is the block-front design , with its deep cut , vigorous shell , which was used for such diverse pieces of useful furniture as chests , desks , and secretaries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally in Connecticut , but in no other colonies . Chests-on-chests and secretaries were two other types of furniture which were given more attention in America than in England . Chests of drawers discarded straight fronts for shaped serpentine fronts , and elaborated a plain foot in a variety of ways . Tea tables and card tables followed English models ( with purely native variations ) , and console tables with fine marble tops were a luxurious addition to the repertoire of the American cabinetmaker . Beds were commonly four-posted , though they  | seldom equaled the elaborations of the typical English Chippendale bed , heavily carved and draped . In a preoccupation with the beautiful and elegant furniture of the American rococo period , executed in gleaming mahogany , it is easy to forget that there was much furniture ? equally beautiful in its way ? done in less exotic woods , such as a ruddy native cherry , and tawny maple , as well as walnut . Much the same is true of simpler country products , such as the Windsor chair . The Windsor ( which appeared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England ) received its greatest development here , and is thought of today as one of the most characteristically American of all the decorative furnishings of any period . Originating in Philadelphia , the Windsor was orginally intended for the farm , the simple house , or the porch of a more elaborate and sophisticated mansion . As a form , it persisted for over a hundred years because it combined a number of virtues . It was strong , yet light and portable . It was comfortable for almost any type of figure or any age . It was a good " mixer . " And it was cheap . The best models of Windsors are the earliest ? that is , those designed before 179o ? before they became standardized in style and decoration . There are roughly six types of Windsors , all of which are graceful and useful , depending on the purpose for which you intend them . The low-back resembles the so-called " captain 's chair " ; the comb-back is tall and refined ; the hoop-back or bow-back is medium in height ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is simpler than these and more graceful . Windsors are  | usually made of a combination of woods and then painted black , red , or green . Materials . Almost all upholstery fabrics in the early eighteenth century in America were imported . Those which were not were naturally of the plainer type , such as linen and wools , which might be spun , woven , and printed at home . Early in the period , imported velvets were popular , combined with needlework . Later , damasks were especially used , as well as plain silks , brocatels , and brocades . All of these were used as much as possible exactly as they were in London , following the latest fashion . Wallpapers were also imported ( they might be English or Chinese ) , and so were rugs , which commonly came from Asia Minor , unless a domestic " turkey work " ( in imitation of an Oriental ) was used . A variation in floor covering was painted canvas . Except on a smaller and less lavish scale , the average Colonial of means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from England , or about which he had read or heard . Colorful and fragile accessories were importations which were costly necessities to achieve this effect . Characteristics . The rococo style in Italy is a history of makebelieve . Its beauty and originality and its dazzling wealth of painted decoration very often mask inferior materials and poor workmanship . Once you accept this fact , you are free to go ahead and indulge your taste for rich , sensuous color and theatrical forms , and to mix these pieces for effect with other styles of furniture of the same period from other countries . Not all Italian rococo furniture is painted , and you may prefer the simpler walnut examples which rely on beauty of wood and vigor of curving line for their interest . Italian rococo is a more uninhibited variation of the style than the French , and in some ways it is more sympathetic because it is less carefully thought out . Plain or painted , it has the warmth and the exuberance of the Italian personality . Background . Italian interiors of the early eighteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Renaissance and seventeenth-century baroque scale and grandeur are softened somewhat by the new eighteenth-century fashions , but , in general , the Italians did n't worry too much about redoing their rooms completely in the rococo taste . A major difference was the use of stucco instead of wood paneling , a device which is easy to assimilate today . Often architecture was faked with paint , and imitation marble was commoner than the  | real thing . Floors were rarely wood ; the national taste was for native marble or terrazzo ( a composition of marble chips ) . When more color was needed on the walls , they were hung with silk . There was a profusion of gilding and paint , and a wealth of great mirrors and mirrored sconces , as well as crystal chandeliers . In comparison to France and England , there is less interest in comfort , and less intimacy . Motifs . Since the Italian style followed the French enthusiastically , all their typical devices were adapted . The chief difference is in the way in which they were executed ? less subtly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A variety of brilliant color is of major importance in Italian rococo decoration , in architecture , in furniture , and in fabrics . Furniture . Italian cabinetmakers followed France in design almost exclusively . A second source of inspiration was England , especially in secretary forms . These models are altered in Italy because of : a lack of wealth ; a lack of unity ( different cities produced different styles ) ; and a native love of color and exaggeration . The best Italian furniture in the rococo manner is painted , and of this the Venetian color and texture are considered the best , so much so that " Venetian " is a tag applied now to all Italian painted furniture , whether it actually comes from that city or from any of a number of others . Natural walnut was secondarily popular , especially in the north . And there was some lacquer furniture of a quality inferior to English and French . Most typical French types of furniture  | were reproduced in Italy ? with modifications more or less governed by cost . A favorite was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of white powder and glue ) , later varnished . Often carving or gesso relief was picked out in gilt for further elaboration . Or lacquer was used for color effect , or cutouts of paper pasted on wood ( called decoupage ) . All of these decorative methods are subject to rapid deterioration and damage , which means that Italian antique pieces found in today 's market have usually been subjected to restoration , and that modern reproductions ( because of the labor involved in fine painting ) are expensive . Because the society of the period in Italy was peculiarly a frivolous and play-acting one , their furniture is decorative in an artificial way . Its construction and its woods ( if painted ) are likely to be poor . The person who likes Italian furniture of this period is ready to forgive its faults for its considerable virtues , its riotous color , its exquisite painting , its soft gilding , and its naive and charming excesses . Its curves are commonly exaggerated , its proportions are often heavy or even top-heavy , and its ornament too profuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was created , in general , for rooms in the grand baroque manner . But it is a style which grows in appeal with understanding , and its popularity is considerable today . With the usual emphasis thrown heavily on painted furniture of bold and intricate design , it is easy to overlook the simple furniture of the Italian rococo . Much of this group was executed in walnut , though there was some furniture painted white , blue , yellow , green , or red , without involved painted decoration superimposed . A conservative section of the population then , as now , preferred those pieces which relied on vigorous ,  | bold curves , and a minimum of distracting details for a maximum of effect . These models rarely had applied metal mounts , or even handles ( drawer keys were used as pulls instead ) . Now and then there might be a certain amount of marquetry , but this is kept within bounds . Characteristics . In Germany and Austria the rococo style is so closely related to the earlier baroque style , imported directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difference in motif and scale . Even scale is not too good a criterion , since in these countries rococo details are markedly coarser in execution than their French cousins . Germans and Austrians of the eighteenth century were uncommonly fond of theatrical effects , and , as such , they perpetuated conscious exaggeration for an increased powerful impression which was a commonplace of baroque , seventeenth-century decoration . German and Austrian rococo details are therefore typically a superficial overlay imposed on strong baroque foundations . In general , the chief differences between German and Austrian rococo ( as compared to its French counterpart ) are : a mass of ornament which often seems excessive , vulgar , and ostentatious ; and a decided coarseness and heaviness of proportion and applied details . It is always a  | more fantastic and , at the same time , a more masculine version of the style . Background . Other differences make the picture clearer . German and Austrian interiors spread their rococo ornament over entire wail and ceiling surfaces , instead of confining it to tops and bottoms of panels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Imported French designers , working in their most extreme manner , had their designs painstakingly executed by methodical German workmen . The result is strangely unlike the personality of either characteristic national work . Frederick the Great used only French or German artisans , and his three palaces ? the Town Palace , the New Palace , and Sans Souci at Potsdam , near Berlin ? are generally counted as some of the greatest products of the whole rococo age . Other subtle style changes occur in the extraordinary variety of capitals ( down to the time of the French Revolution , Germany was made up of more than three hundred distinct states or petty kingdoms ) . Rococo decoration appeared not only in great palaces but in town and country private houses of distinction . Bavarian work differs from Prussian , and Prussian from Viennese . The pavilion called Amalienburg , near Munich , is considered one of three or four top examples in the world of the rococo spirit . Amalienburg represents the most lavish combination of gold and silver work of its kind to be seen anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensively used in German rococo wall treatment ( as at Amalienburg ) , and exotic effects , such as walls of porcelain or tortoise shell , were popular .  | Motifs . French Louis XV motifs of naturalistic foliage , flowers , fruit , and birds , as well as shells and the rest , were adapted in a coarsened and less well-thought-out form . German and Austrian motifs commonly give the impression of being grafted onto a piece , rather than of being an integral part of a unit , as in France . Colors . If plaster decoration was often unsubtle , colors were the reverse . Silver and pale blue are used both at Amalienburg and at Potsdam , and other pale tints are common . Furniture . German rococo furniture , as a whole , may be summed up in one word : heavy . It is heavy in scale and proportion , in excessive detailing of marquetry , in needlessly involved projections and receding planes , and in the execution of its elaborate ormolu . In most cases , decoration is clumsy and misplaced , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conspicuously overornate . German rococo furniture should be divided into : ( I ) the middle of the eighteenth century , the period of the worst excesses , and ( 2 ) the period of restraint , from 176o to 1770 . Frederick 's New Palace at Potsdam belongs to the later period , and its furniture of palatial luxury almost all came not from German artisans but from France . German domestic cabinetmakers were entirely governed by the influence of France , except for some of the simpler Dutch and English designs for chairs and cupboards which were taken as models for German furniture made chiefly for the middle-class buyer . Bavaria and Austria went in for painted and elaborately carved furniture which had a flavor of its own . When considering this style as an adjunct of contemporary living , it is an excellent idea to remind yourself of a few points that made it an international favorite in its own day . First and foremost , it was the product of a number of highly imaginative artistic personalities . In shopping be constantly on the lookout for pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fine execution and exquisite techniques . Look for these whether you are shopping for antiques or reproductions . If it is the latter , notice whether the detailing is good , the carving is crisp , the woods and finishes are mellow , and the upholstery is " right . " Many a good model is ruined by an insensitive , heavy hand in any of these departments . And finally , beware of pieces that look " worked over . " The art of the rococo is spontaneous and fresh .  | The return to the classic taste in the late eighteenth century ? the classic influence had had intermittent world revivals since the time of the Italian Renaissance ? was a result of two logical pressures which were exerted more or less simultaneously all over the design world . The inevitable popular reaction against the complicated excesses of the rococo style had set in ; and the culmination of centuries of studying the archeological past now reached a point where action was indicated . About the middle of the eighteenth century a tremendous impetus was given to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Herculaneum . The excavations at Herculaneum began in 1738 , and those of Pompeii in 1748 . The world excitement over the subject of these new evidences of ancient civilization and its forms of architecture and decoration was extraordinary . Almost immediately a number of copiously illustrated publications propagandizing the classic spirit came pouring from the presses of France , Italy , England , and Germany . The intensity of interest generated in ancient domestic interiors and ornament revolutionized all contemporary interior design in fairly short order . The Early Classic Revival style was interested in domestic ( as opposed to public ) Roman interiors . The Neo-Classic style ( which followed in logical design sequence , as well as chronologically ) followed public Roman interiors and motifs in France , but in other countries ( such as England , Germany , and the United States ) centered its attention on Greece . Though one style grew out of the other , they are each readily distinguishable , one from the other , in a number of ways . The Classic Revival period produced many of the objects which are among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graceful Louis XVI medallion-back chair , half-round chests and commodes , all the practical and elegant designs of Sheraton and Hepplewhite , and , in America , the " Martha Washington " chair and the " Salem secretary . " It is above all an elegant , precise style . It does n't mix with everything and it does n't " go " just anywhere . It is the ultimate , very often , in delicate formality , and if your interior is robust or casual , it is probable that you will he among the group that find this period arid and cold . If , on the other hand , you revel in exquisite detailing , simplicity , and subtlety of proportion and line , this style is made for you .  | When Louis XVI came to the throne in 1774 , the design spirit which bears his name was already well established . Called the antique style by its contemporaries , it replaced classic details , but details of very different scale from the monumental classicism of Louis XIV . Refinement and delicacy were more important than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The straight line eliminated the rococo curve . Decoration becomes abstract , ordered , and rational . All forms can be described with a straight edge and a compass . Such curves as there are are limited to the half-round and the ellipse . Nothing is free-hand , if it can be achieved through mechanical means . Verticality and horizontality are supreme . Background . Wall decoration is simpler , severer , and classically pure . Like the rococo style , the accent is on interior decoration which is homogeneous . Motifs and devices are used in architecture and furniture alike . Rectilinear and rectangular patterns are worked out in absolute symmetry . Curves are avoided , and when they occur they are always confined within rectangular moldings or panels . Angles are no longer rounded off and disguised . Pediments are unbroken , and so are cornices . Details of carving are attenuated and refined . Projections are shallower  | and flatter . About the only thing preserved from the previous reign of Louis XV is an intimate scale . Motifs . Contrary to Louis XV or rococo procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " by-the-yard " fashion . Another characteristic is their small , almost too-small , scale . The commonest running ornament is a series of short flutings . Others are gadroons , interlacing pleated ribbons , rosettes , and leaves like acanthus , myrtle , and oak . A common device is bead or pearl moldings . Motifs were borrowed from the antique , or were modern . Of the former , the commonest were : the column , free-standing or engaged , usually fluted ( spirally as well as vertically ) ; the caryatid ; and the console or bracket . From the antique style , too , came the use of garlands or leaves or flowers , urns , bows and quivers . Modern motifs common to Louis XVI as well as Louis XV decoration are : baskets of flowers or fruits , roses ( a favorite of Marie Antoinette ) , lilies , and ribbon knots . Medallions occur with lovers ' trophies , as well as symbols of the sciences , war , music , and the rest . The upright oak branch or the lily stem cropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treated naturally . Roses , anemones , and daisies might appear cut and carelessly scattered with birds and insects hovering overhead , or they might be used in garlands of ribbon-tied bouquets . The influence of Rousseau preaching a back-to-nature , healthy life made  | sentimental , rustic objects more popular than ever . Beehives , sheaves of wheat , vegetables , garden tools , were obviously a symptom . Finally , a whole group of designs and motifs based on Roman arabesques cropped up more and more : panels in grisaille reproduced ancient figure groups . Real and mythological animals came from Roman sources as well : eagles , dolphins , lions , goats ' and rams ' heads , hinds ' hoofs , griffons , sphinxes , and sirens . Colors . Soft and cool colors were favorites . White and gold was a  | combination held over from Louis XV days . Off-white , silver gray , silvery rose , pale blues , and pale greens were commonest for large areas . A number of pungent , sharp color contrasts appeared in small doses , such as vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furniture . Louis XVI furniture , like Louis XVI architecture , was a complete right-about-face toward the straight line as against the curved . Chairs are less roomy , and more angular than Louis XV examples , but they are more varied in outline . Legs , at least , are always straight , though backs may be rectangular or elliptical . The medallion back , like the open lyre back , is much harder to do , and results in these designs are sometimes less happy than the squared-off models . Fluting and turning were common , and , of course , classic detailing . Side chairs are often leather covered , or caned , with loose cushions . The drop-front secretary was one of the favorite pieces of the period , with its uncompromising rectangular , classic outline . Usually , heavily decorated with marquetry , it may be large for men , or dainty and small and placed on slim legs for ladies ' use . Commodes are either rectangular or half-round in shape , or with two or three drawers , and usually with plain rectangular drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Legs may be squared off or round and fluted . Brass added to flutings and moldings was a late and decadent device at the end of the period . Stretchers reappear . Extending dining tables ? round or oval are legacies of Louis XV . Console tables arc varied , the commonest being  | a half-round type with classic applied details , such as garlands , urns , or bows . Card tables and fancy tables are infinitely varied . The latter appear decorated with porcelain plaques of Sevres or Wedgwood . Small ladies ' bureaus ( called bonheurs du jour ) appeared in a great many models , glazed or fitted with mirrors , and some with roll tops . Sofas and chaises longues follow Louis XV models with Louis XVI angularity . Beds are varied , too . The most often seen is the " Angel " bed with equal head- and footboard . The " Polonaise " was draped from a crown suspended on metal arms attached to the frame itself . The only really new piece of furniture of the period was the vitrine , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is consistent with use , all Louis XVI furniture is fragile and delicate . It delights in being exquisite , and in proportion as it succeeds , it can only fill a limited position in today 's more practical , vigorous living . Its fancy table is its typical product . Frivolous and often jewel-like in its scale and decoration , it had its place in a deliberately impractical society . Materials . Stripes took the place of waving curves in many Louis XVI brocades . Tiny scale and precision of placement followed the rules of decoration in architecture and furniture . White and cream designs were thrown on grounds of pale blues , greens , yellows , mauve , or crimson . Gold and silver threads were used and , of course , all the silk combinations . A return to the simple life made cottons popular , and especially the new cottons printed at Jouy , the so-called toiles de Jouy . Philippe de la Salle wove his naturalistic bucolic scenes in some of the most  | elaborate silks ever created . Toiles or other fabrics might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on furniture , in a matching design scheme . Why , in spite of its defects , did the Louis XVI style leave such a lasting impression on today 's decoration ? Because its proportions were always exquisitely right , because its masses were always perfectly balanced ; because its surfaces were invariably perfectly divided . If it seems to modern eyes to go too far in its preoccupation with exactitude , it yet has a charm and grace and beauty quite unlike any other style . Provincial Louis XVI pieces merely grafted classic ornaments on to their old rococo armoires and other pieces . Country tastes did not take kindly to the rigidity and coldness of the classic pattern ( there are hardly any Directoire or Empire provincial pieces of furniture ) . There is very little intrinsic difference between provincial furniture in the Louis XVI or the Louis XV style . The distances were too great from the sphere of influence ( Paris ) , and the time lag was too extended . However , in common with other more sophisticated furniture of the classic revival , provincial furniture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age . Late eighteenth-century furniture in Germany , from 1770 on , reflects both French and English ideas . Straight lines and motifs are  | borrowed from Louis XVI , stucco work from Adam . Berlin and Vienna are centers for the best decorative furniture at the end of the eighteenth century , where the more elaborate models were appreciated . More modest homes looked for furniture influenced by Hepplewhite and Sheraton designs as found in their drawing books . As in England , the simple usefulness of these ideas had a wide appeal . The classic revival in Italy , in spite of classic sources on the spot ( Herculaneum and Pompeii ) , became popular only after the movement had gained momentum in France . Once launched , however , designers went back directly to native examples ; copied Pompeian , Etruscan , and Roman details ; and added the Renaissance arabesques of Raphael , as well as the theatrical fantasies of the designer Piranesi , and the Milanese , Albertoli . Italian taste rejected the more sentimental French motifs , such as ribbon bow knots , tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally getting smaller and more practical . Floor plans included the classic , the round room , the oval room , and niches . Other antique conventions were columns , pilasters , marble and mosaic floors , and the liberal use of ancient sculpture for decoration . Furniture was related to its background . Colors were cooler and less florid . Details were finer . And forms were , as elsewhere , rectilinear , elliptical , or oval . Marquetry was especially fine in the north , though painted furniture continued its popularity with new motifs . Italian furniture of this period is still generally heavier and coarser in detailing than its French counterpart , but its lack of precise scale is often its chief charm today . Chairs were especially varied and followed not only French but Adam , Sheraton , and Hepplewhite styles as well . The classic tradition had long been strong in English architecture under the influence of the Italian Renaissance . The innovations of the latter part of the eighteenth century were chiefly in the matter of scale . Robert Adam and his brothers protested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , but against a style which the design world now felt was too massive and ponderous and which was in danger of becoming too baroque . The Adam innovations ( they first introduced them as early as 1759 ) were almost universally adopted in important houses and were inevitably reflected in much simpler form in the smaller , average in- Meticulous attention to minor details , as seen in this key plate , is an ideal of interior design as practiced by the Adam brothers . terior . In these homes the new style was followed in more delicate moldings , in fireplaces without great overmantels , and in walls covered with textiles and wallpapers instead of carving and paneling . In general , the Adam influence introduced the following changes : an absolute unity of interior design , down to the minutest detail , from ceilings to door hardware ; circular and elliptical floor plans , and niches ; a new stress on livability ( Adam looked for " greater gaiety and elegance of ornament " ) ; a markedly more graceful architectural treatment , lighter in scale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modeled in low stucco relief . Today , the pure Adam style is derided as being too " gingerbready " and too finicky . If used at all , it is found chiefly in public rooms in hotels or clubs . Its influence on American decoration before i 800 , however , was tremendous . Small homes from Maine to Georgia were affected in architecture and in interiors , and chiefly in the use of composition for details of ceilings and mantels . In other words , the smaller houses in England and America , by other architects , working in a very similar manner , are , paradoxically , Robert Adam 's chief legacy . A host of followers simplified and modified the perfection of the true Adam style . It is important to know about " Adam " mainly because Robert and his brothers were the source of so much that is familiar to us in modified form . The typical late Georgian house was the little house , well scaled and extremely comfortable . The typical Adam house , on the other hand , was the great house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insistence on an harmonious whole , on an exterior and an interior which were of one scheme , and on all details of any interior , down to the minutest ac- cessory , being part of a careful over-all plan . The most serious faults of the style were its lack of originality and its fondness for substitutes . Stucco was used for marble , composition for carving . The latter deteriorates rapidly , which accounts for an infinity of fine detailing in England and America which is in shabby condition today . Motifs . Robert Adam , in his original research , was searching for ancient domestic interiors as sources for decoration , as against the great public buildings of Rome . He found his inspiration in a hitherto unknown palace of Diocletian , at Spalato , in Dalmatia . The details he copied at home were : carefully spaced loops and wreaths of husks , the fan , the honeysuckle , and bas-reliefs of classical figures , musical instruments , and the rest , in the slightest proportion . Paneling was largely " out , " and flat color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . Ornament was largely painted by the best Italian workmen , such as the famous Ciprani and Zucchi . Pompeian details were imitated and adapted . Animal motifs were rams ' heads , goats ' heads , goats ' feet , lions ' heads , griffons , birds , and human figures .  | Colors . Very pale tints of every kind were fashionable , as well as the stronger so-called Pompeian and Etruscan earth colors , and especially a liberal use of black and pea green . Furniture . The two Adam brothers were primarily architects and designers , not furniture manufacturers . The actual makers of Adam furniture were Chippendale , Hepplewhite , and a number of other cabinetmakers . The forms and motifs were introduced by the Adams ; and their domination of design inspiration in England till the end of the century made them important to furniture , architectural , and design history . Contours in Adam furniture were entirely new . Rectangles replaced curves , and all furniture was consciously lighter and more delicate . Case pieces were soundly constructed , but chairs and settees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cabinetmaker who executed them . All lines were vertical and horizontal . Legs tapered to spade feet or were rounded and fluted . Moldings were exceedingly refined . The oval appears chiefly in mirrors , semioval side tables , and in console cabinets ( regarded as essential between windows ) . Adam furniture , characteristically , uses many fancy woods as veneers , ornamental painting , and inlay rather than carving . All changes were in the direction of lightness and color . Satinwood was a top favorite . Other common woods for added color were tulipwood , harewood , and holly . Gilding added to the effect of richness . Whereas much of this furniture looks overdecorated to modern eyes , without the painting and the gilding , it would be quite austere and cold . Ideally , everything matched in an Adam room , which accounts for many details which are almost wholly architectural or adapted from the frigidly correct drawings of ancient elevations . Less attenuated and more vigorous Adam designs were executed in mahogany , though carving in it was considerably slighter than the mid-Georgian period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century in England was stiff and mannered . The typical drawing room had its chairs ranged against the four walls , a pair of tables or cabinets between the windows , with mirrors above , and a center table or occasional tables breaking up the center area . Hepplewhite , as an individual compared with Adam , had no very great impact on the design world . He himself does not claim originality , and his style is a combination of influences . From Adam he takes ornamental detail ; from Louis XVI furniture he takes forms and details ; and  | at times he copied Sheraton , or Sheraton copied him . The architectural influence of the Adam brothers was paramount during the period of Hepplewhite 's greatest activity , and his chief contribution was to provide practical , flexible , and less rigidly pedantic articles for use in Adam or Adam-influenced small interiors . Hepplewhite took the Adams ' ideas and made them palatable and workable for the average home . He popularized light woods , and he showed the beauty of discreet inlay used in simple mahogany surfaces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking in both Adam and Sheraton designs , for his rectangular forms were often softened by subtle curves , as in his serpentine and bow-front chest of drawers . And he invented the shield-back chair . Though the spade foot is associated  | Three characteristic Hepplewhite designs for shield-back chairs . with Hepplewhite , and his legs were commonly square in section , he also did a gracefully flaring foot called " French , " which has a restraint altogether British . His chair backs were considerably varied : the best known are the shield-back ; the " Prince of Wales " back with its three feathers ; or a number of designs with flattened urns and swags , used as a splat . His sofas were usually upholstered and strongly French in feeling . His tables were elegant and practical at the same time , such as the " Pembroke . " His sideboards ( taken from Shearer , a contemporary cabinetmaker 's invention ) were on four or six legs , and generally were shaped in front . When carving was used , it was elaborate in detail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were almost entirely Adam : floral swags , pendant husks , round and oval paterae , and the inevitable rams ' heads . To these he added reeding , fluting , beading , fans , rosettes , and ribbons . The Prince of Wales feathers , ears of wheat , and the lyre were other favorites . His French borrowing was largely from Louis XV , though Louis XVI medallion-back chairs had a fascination for him , too . Sheraton spans the transition period between the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . What the world thinks of as Sheraton is mostly contained in his first drawing book of 1791 . His later publications included  | designs which were progressively heavier and more clumsy , and often grotesque . At his best , he is purer and more classic than Hepplewhite . He was the great champion of the straight line , and he followed Louis XVI designs assiduously , while France returned the compliment . Often called the " English Louis XVI " style , Sheraton 's designs , like the French , emphasized verticality and horizontality , and his severely simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geometric forms and principles , his furniture is quieter and stronger in appearance at times than the more imaginative Hepplewhite . It is the furniture , par excellence , for small reception rooms , drawing rooms , and the prim boudoir . Sheraton and Hepplewhite . designed much the same list of useful furniture , except that Sheraton developed a sideline of ingenious , dualpurpose furniture , which at times threatened to get too involved for its simple outline . He liked better a high , perpendicular look to his case pieces , and many of them verge on the top-heavy . His chair backs were  | commonly squared off , and his legs were usually round , tapered , and reeded . His sofas were caned as well as upholstered , and were often long enough to have eight legs . He liked dart : mahogany with satinwood inlay , though he did a number of beech chairs , painted or japanned , the so-called " fancy Sheraton " chair . His sideboards were of considerable variety , and their fronts were more commonly bowed than serpentine , if any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the usual classic ones , were : the oval , a particularly graceful urn , the conch shell , and the Roman diamond lattice in chair backs , as well as fluting and reeding . Some points occur over and over again in all furniture of this period , regardless of the individual designer . These are general points to look out for . There are no real " easy " chairs in this period . Settees and couches are likely to be uncomfortable because their backs are fairly straight up and down , and because they have no springs . This is the period of beautiful small tables . They may be highly decorated or chastely inlaid and restrained . Sideboards are an invention of this era : they did not occur before . Four-poster beds were never better designed . Practically all of this furniture is suitable for today 's needs and it is the prototype of most of contemporary reproductions . Materials . Late eighteenth-century fabrics were not as rich in quality , weight , or design as those of the beginning of the century . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for smooth , slick  | surfaces . Designs are small , and stripes are an innovation . Linen and cotton as well as silk are used . Printed cottons are important , either imported or domestic . Carpets are especially designed , as in the case of great Adam houses , or else imported from France . Walls are commonly stretched with silk self-colored damasks , or stripes . Wallpapers are more popular as they become cheaper , and borders are introduced for the first time . The Federal period is as familiar to the average American as the back yard at home . It is a style which is much seen in reproduction , and it has the easy , uncomplicated look of the best Hepplewhite and Sheraton furniture , because American designers took many of their ideas directly from these two sources . It is no less formal as a style , for all its familiarity , and the person who wants to work a scheme around treasured family heirlooms or reproductions of this period will find more stiffness and precision creeping into the picture than he or she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , than its English or French prototypes , because American taste preferred simpler interpretations . Because it is simple , it measures up well to present-day standards of good taste . Characteristics . The Federal period reflects the plainer taste of the rich merchants and shipowners of the American coastal cities . There was a new consciousness both of national spirit and of separation from European domination . Widespread prosperity brought with it leisure and material well-being . Designers were searching for originality , away from the powerful urge to copy England and France . Amateur gentlemanarchitects and interior designers , like Jefferson , took an active interest in their homes and in the homes of others . The founders of the republic  | Joked to Rome for inspiration , with perhaps more logic than other ountries who did the same thing in Europe . Jefferson argued that the ew young republic ought to pattern itself on the old . He himself studied roman ruins on French soil during his stay in France as minister , in 784 . He returned to the United States imbued with the classic spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In spite of its efforts to free itself from European influence , the classic Revival spirit in America was much taken with the refined manner of the Adam brothers in England ( who were working with Roman motifs as well ) . Bulfinch , and McIntire were two famous architect-craftsnen in New England who translated English ideas to Yankee idioms with emarkable success . By 1814 the country was over its political growing pains , for a time , at least ; and new wealth and prosperity eagerly seized on the opportunity to build a fresh style on the strong foundation of the earlier Georgian pattern . Direct communication with Europe as well as England added a touch of French taste as well to the American scene . Background . Houses had a greater flexibility of plan and a new refinement and chastity of detail . By the end of the century , circular , elliptical , and octagonal floor plans gave a new variety to room arrange- ment . Delicate pediments , reeded and fluted pilasters , and other classic details in plaster were replacing the heavier Georgian moldings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground ; their commonest form was the circular-headed or the three-part Palladian opening . Plain plaster walls were relieved by delicate moldings , trim , slender pilasters , and the simplest of motifs in carved wood or plaster composition . Ceilings were plain or decorated with attenuated Adam stucco ornament , such as swags or fan forms . Stairs were uncommonly graceful . Important scenic papers were the only really vigorous note found on walls . Motifs . Purely patriotic motifs were popular , such as the American eagle and stars . American naval engagements were used as stucco motifs  | in mantels . Domestic symbols such as sheaves of wheat , grapevines , garlands , fruit , and cornucopias appear , with thunderbolts , drapery swags , acanthus and laurel leaves . Reeding ? a well-used English and French Classic Revival device ? was especially popular in the United States as well . In furniture , bell-flower and book inlay were among the most popular designs . Colors . Popular colors were elegant , delicate , and restrained , and were usually grayed . Pearl gray , lavender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as " ashes of roses " were typical . Furniture . Most Federal furniture is light and graceful in appearance ? physically light and light of color . Mahogany , when used , is finished in a light tone or inlaid or veneered with lighter woods . Curly maple ( a purely American expression ) is much used , as well as satinwood . Carving is largely confined to chairs and sofas ; case pieces are generally veneered and inlaid . Painted decoration , following the superelegant English and French manner , is less used in America ( except in Baltimore ) because it is less expressive of any real need . Mirrors are mahogany and gilt , or wood and composition , in the exceedingly delicate Adam manner . Materials . America during the Federal period was dependent on Europe for almost all her fine textiles and decorative accessories . Everything used in England and France was imported in large quantities . An Americanism is the popularity of haircloth in black or in colors for upholstery . Toiles de Jouy were especially designed for the American trade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | cottons of straight Louis XVI , Directoire , or Empire designs are also used . As abroad , silks are combined with fine mull for draperies . Block-printed wallpapers ( made chiefly in France , but also in England ) are the most popular wall covering of the time and replaced Chinese papers . These are gay , flowered papers , or else scenic , panoramic subjects in great variety . Imported rugs and carpets ( usually Aubussons ) cover the floor in both early as well as later periods . Phyfe , like Chippendale , is a name which has been given such prominence that many think of him as the only American cabinetmaker of any worth . This is , of course , an exaggeration , even if applied to his own period . Part of the feeling of pre-eminence which is attached to his name is the result of his very long career ( he opened his New York shop in the early 1790 's and only retired from business in 1847 ) , and the fact that he worked in a variety of styles ranging from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new republic covered the best period of Phyfe furniture ; after 1820 his work became progressively heavier and more clumsy . At its finest , Phyfe furniture stands for the highest standards of workmanship ; the best woods ; graceful , simple , classic curves ; subtle proportions ; and well-placed ornament , crisply carved . His output was confined to chairs , sofas , tables , and sideboards , and he worked almost entirely in solid mahogany ( sometimes adding a little satinwood ) until his later period when he turned to rosewood . His earlier period was influenced strongly by Sheraton designs , and he used similar motifs , such as reeding on slimly tapered legs . Another influence , however , which is more familiar  | to the general public , came from the France of the Directory and the Consulate . This was the period of Phyfe 's delicately executed lyre-back chairs , his finely proportioned and nicely carved sofas , and his simple tripod tables with plain brass hardware . Phyfe motifs are limited but beautifully executed . Crispness of carving is the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done by his contemporaries . His earlier furniture used classic ornament such as the lyre , acanthus and oak leaves , drapery swags , thunderbolts , and such American innovations as the sheaf of wheat and cornucopias . Later , both his detailing and his motifs became coarser ( he reputedly scorned these pieces created for a new taste ) , and much of the furniture of this Empire period was heavy and overornamented . Phyfe was not the only fine cabinetmaker of his period . Other names to remember are : Samuel McIntire , of Salem , whose chief claim to fame is his designs for houses and furniture in the Adam manner ; Charles Lannuier , a Frenchman settling in New York , who worked entirely in the French Empire style ; John Seymour of Boston ; Henry Connelly of Philadelphia ; and Michael Allison and Thomas Burling of New York . Some regional styles of striking originality provide sidelines in Americana . Some of these , such as Shaker , have no counterpart anywhere else in the world . All of these styles have their roots deep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? of farm societies , and they naturally belong in the country . Their influence today is based on their simple honesty and  | freedom from all self-consciousness . If you like unsophisticated designs and unpretentious living , these styles are likely to appeal to you . The Pennsylvania Dutch ( the word " Dutch " here being a corruption of the German word " deutsch " ) were farmers from Germany and Central Europe who fled to America in successive waves of emigration throughout the eighteenth century . They brought with them their religious affiliations and planted the customs and manners of their homeland in several counties in Pennsylvania , practically to the exclusion of every other European influence . A paramount love of theirs was for strong , bright , cheerful color , and their influence on the American decorative arts was completely fresh . They combined intensity with a feeling for simple , natural , and comfortable forms , in a limited output confined to a comparatively small district . In point of time , the style covers roughly the period from 1750 to 185o , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nineteenth century . Motifs . Many motifs were religious or symbolic , others reflected a love of the soil and ordinary farm life . Some of the commonest were : hearts ( large and small ) ; birds ( the eagle , pelican , dove , swans , roosters , peacocks , and a distelfeel ) ; flowers ( tulips , roses , fuchsias , forget-me-nots , violets , and lilies ) ; fruit ( grapes and pomegranates ) ; stars ( six , and eight-point ) ; mounted horsemen ; animals ( deer , rabbits , hare , hounds , lions , and unicorns ) ; human groups ( children or man and his wife ) ; and geometric designs . Colors . Colors were generally bold and bright , and strong reds ,  | yellows , oranges , and greens were favorites . But soft colors were used as well , like washed-out blue , soft , dove gray , browns , clay , charcoal black , pale greens , pink , and a bottle green . Gold was often used in accents . Furniture . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is heavy and solid . The forms were modified and simplified to conform to American necessities , but they were always completely different from comparable pieces in New England or the South . Simple chests with two or three drawers were the most common decorated pieces , painted in blue or red , and having fronts divided into two- or three-arched panels . Only dower chests were decorated as well as painted : others were left in plain paint . Other useful articles were : the sawbuck table , an open cupboard similar to the Welsh dresser , and plank-seat chairs . Corner cupboards were used to display pottery , and wall racks to hold pewter . The woods might be vividly painted or not . If unfinished , they were usually executed in walnut or maple . Materials . A great variety of printed cottons were used , as well as calicoes . The district was famous also for woolen coverlets , patchwork quilts , and hand-woven linens . Small plaids and checks were favorites . Bright braided or hooked rugs decorated plain floors ( some floors were painted or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important to the style than its major items . Characteristically colorful , they are : slipware of natural red clay , and " Gaudy Dutch " pottery ( made in Staffordshire for the American market ) ; brightly decorated tinware with red or black grounds ; colorful , enamel-decorated glass of the Stiegel type ; wood carvings ; certificates or illuminated manuscripts , called " fracturs . " Norwegians , Swedes , and Finns , emigrating to America , have provided a colorful style ? in states such as Minnesota and Wisconsin ? which somewhat resembles the colorful products of Pennsylvania Dutch . Like the Germans of Pennsylvania , the Scandinavians applied bright designs to painted chests and cupboards , and combined floral forms with Viking conventionalized patterns , called " rosemaling . " In general , Scandinavianpainted designs are more realistic than their German counterparts , and more animals and human figures are used . The Shaker style has long been admired by many as one that is in some ways the most authentic native American expression . It makes no  | concessions to any other country or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functionalism , and its extreme purity of line , devoid of all ornament , has proved to be an inspiration to contemporary furniture designers in America . The Shakers , or Shaking Quakers , were a religious sect from England which first settled in America in 1776 . Their first meetinghouse was built in New York State in 1786 , sending out new groups to Massachusetts , Connecticut , New Hampshire , and Maine , and , in the early nineteenth century , to Ohio , Kentucky , and Indiana . Their influence continued through the 184o 's . The Shakers believed in common property . Their faith stressed separation from the world and the second coming of Christ . Ornament was thought of as a sinful indulgence , and all their furniture was reduced to the least common denominator consistent with practical use . Little of it was individual ( the group was the important thing , always ) , and little was experimental . Paradoxically , in trying to eliminate beauty , the Shakers created a new kind of furniture , pure and clean in line , thoughtfully proportioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Shaker religion eliminated all ornament as being distracting and superfluous .  | Colors . Walls were uniformly whitewashed . Woods were left in their natural light color or painted yellow , red , or green . Furniture . When the contemporary world thinks of Shaker , it recalls furniture which is strangely modern in conception . Every piece of Shaker furniture was made to be useful , first and foremost . The range of designs was extremely limited , since rigid standards of excellence and uniformity were more highly prized than imagination . Characteristic forms were : the slat-back chair , simple cottage beds , candle stands , plain tables , chests , chests of drawers , and a modern-looking , built-in " storage wall . " The Shakers were also among the first to make a rocking chair . Structure was undisguised , and woods were finished in light stains and varnishes to enhance the natural grain . Turnings were simple and uncomplicated , or legs were tapered instead of turned . Moldings were often discarded altogether for sharp-angled corners . Turned pegs took the place of hardware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group society demanded furniture with a community purpose ) , and many pieces were capable of being raised or lowered according to the immediate necessity at hand , though Shaker furniture is generally low . Tailoring and a unique kind of simple elegance and refinement take Shaker furniture somewhat out of the category of country furniture . The Spanish influence on American decorative arts covers a wide territory , and a number of periods from the seventeenth century to the twentieth . Its examples differ according to location , whether they be in Florida , the Gulf Coast , Texas , New Mexico , Arizona , or California . But ,  | in general , domestic architecture usually took the form of a house of one or two stories , built around a patio . Walls were thick and heavy and generally adobe brick , except in Florida , where a mixture of shells was used . The style is predominantly Spanish in character , with some Indian intermingled . The locations where it flourished were separated by great distances ( even in one territory , such as New Mexico or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its best ( in its simplest form ) it combines well with the severest New England and the less exuberant examples of Pennsylvania Dutch . Background . Most interiors were characterized by plain , bare , whitewashed wall spaces sparingly ornamented with color . New Mexican interiors are made dramatic with huge , heavy beams , supported by decorative brackets . In California and Arizona , decorative dadoes were used . Whereas all interiors reflected a Spanish taste ( or Mexican , in the states bordering that country ) some did so more than others . The Moorish , North-African-desert feeling is strong in Arizona , for instance ; the American Indian spirit dominates New Mexico . Most rooms were allpurpose and were not categorized into functions , such as living rooms or dining rooms . Motifs . Common motifs incorporated Spanish and Indian ideas . Flowers or sprays surround circular or pointed center motifs . Birds are used sitting or standing . Some echoes are found of Indian prints or Moorish patterns . Purely local motifs crop up , such as deer , lambs , and goats , in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used . Birds , deer , and other Indian motifs are taken from native pottery in territories where the Indian influence is strong . Colors . Colors are gaudy and bright ( as in California or Arizona ) , or low in key ( as in New Mexico ) . Many too-garish colors used on modern examples of the style are not typical of originals . Furniture . Most furniture , like most rooms , was not confined to one purpose . Types were few ( only the barest necessities were made ) and heavy , and crude in carving and form . Chamferring and notching were favorite primitive decorative devices for furniture made in the colonies . A low bench was common , and pillows and hassocks were sometimes used for seating , as the Moors and the Spanish were accustomed to do . There were no leather chairs ( these are a recent development ) , and no baroque or rococo forms in furniture , as was the case in Spain or 01d Mexico . Chests doubled as tables ( a favorite medieval practice ) .  | A vogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the twentieth century , mislabeled " mission . " Later , at its worst , in the 1920 'S , it confused Italian with Spanish decoration , and scrambled Venetian , Mexican colonial , and Spanish colonial . Polychrome tiles , extravagant wrought-iron , hooded fireplaces , and colorful tapestries and wall hangings completely obscured the real simplicity of the honest , early Spanish colonial style . The neoclassic style of the first half of the nineteenth century is used in today 's homes , either in its original , antique form , or in reproductions , because it fills , as no other style does , a need for formal pieces of rich simplicity and pure line . It combines particularly well with the best of contemporary furniture , which is also concerned with clean forms , a tailored effect , and a direct impact . Bear in mind that this style is sophisticated and formal . If you like an atmosphere of overstuffed chairs and comfortable sprawling before a roaring fire , the chances are that you wo n't go in for neoclassic pieces , except , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a masculine style , weighty in appearance and in fact . It does not go in for delicate details or intricate carving , and its greatest common denominator is its strength ? strength of outline and strength of its beautifully figured woods . The neoclassic style was more homogeneous than many others because designs in all countries relied more or less on the same research in the classic models of Greece and Rome . This research reappeared in differing forms in different countries , depending on their national pot het- book , their available supplies , their national temperament , and , of course , the type of society which ordered fine furnishings . It is important to recognize these differences if you intend to work around this style , either as a basis for a whole room or a house , or as occasional touches to give an average room distinction . Some interpretations of the classic taste may appeal to your needs more than others . Here they are , in brief . The French Revolution of 1789 introduced a new spirit of republicanism not only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jury of Arts was set up to control and give official sanction to a number of dictated designs , and to promote a certain simplicity and austerity . The Directoire style ( named for the Directory of five men who governed France for a short period after the Revolution ) was not created out of the air . Many of its simple forms had been foreshadowed in the last years of the reign of Louis XVI , and many of them were developed in a heavier , coarser way in the Empire period which followed . It was a style which , at its best , has a unique grace and charm , and its reliance on simplicity and purity of line makes it particularly well suited to mixing with other styles in rooms today . Motifs . Purely Republican motifs , such as the eagle and the tricolor cockade , were characteristic . But many motifs not peculiar to the period were used , such as classic Greek or Roman ornament carried over from the Louis XVI style .  | Colors . All sorts of Pompeian colors were especially popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greens . Furniture . In general , all furniture of the period is distinguished by its small scale and its slender proportions . Applied ornament was largely eliminated in favor of a classic line . Chairs were particularly charming , viewed from the vantage point of today 's taste , with a variety of simple backs and slim , tapering legs . ( In America , Duncan Phyfe was much influenced in his work by the Directoire style and its chairs in particular . ) Seating furniture was made lighter in appearance by eliminating stretchers . Furniture woods were mahogany , chestnut , and a number of fruit woods , but painted furniture in light tones was a feature of the Directory style , and one which did not continue into the Empire . Materials . In keeping with the scale of the newer furniture designs , fabrics were light in weight . Silks and satins were used separately or combined with embroidered muslin or mull . Toiles de Jouy were redesigned to accord with the prevailing classic taste . Motifs were purely classic , and narrow stripes were especially popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire or First Empire ) is one of the easiest to spot because it is so definitely stamped in a rigid mold . Napoleon , for whom the style is named , was as much a force in the decorative arts as he was in politics , since he set up a system of state supervision over decorative designs as well as architecture . Through a staff headed by a two-man team of Percier and Fontaine , he set the pace for every fine household in France . The inspiration was almost wholly Roman , an obvious resource in creating an appro- priate background for a militaristic , dictatorship society . In this research , his staff was helped immeasurably by the archeological discoveries and excavations which had been going on during the previous fifty years , by the early Egyptian campaign , ending in i 8o i , and by the many illustrated books done by archeological researchers . If the furniture is stiff and regimented , it is because it was originally designed for a regulated society ; if it is strong and virile , it is because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are used today where a nice balance is needed between usefulness , and a certain dramatic force . The French interpretation of the neoclassic style is , perhaps , the " purest , " in the sense that antique Roman and Greek models were followed slavishly . Empire furniture is massive and severe in outline . Unexpectedly ( because it was concerned with the grand manner ) , much of it is medium or small in scale , which makes it usable for today 's small quarters , especially formal , city apartments . Outlines are rectangular , stiff , and symmetrical . If curves are used , they are the uncomplicated Greek curve . Rich , red mahogany is the favorite wood , though ebony and rosewood are used occasionally . A very few pieces are painted and gilded . The most typical use beautifully chased ormolu ( gilded bronze ) mounts lavishly scattered over their dark mahogany surfaces . Empire mounts are characteristically isolated motifs , having no necessary connection with others on a piece or with the unit on which they are placed . They are not made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a great variety of objects . Large pedestals and pedestal tables are common , supported by a simple column , with bases supported by animal paws . Chair and sofa forms imitate Greek or Roman forms ( mostly Roman ) as much is possible . The same holds true of beds , whose heads and feet are usually of equal height . Lighting fixtures ? candelabra , sconces , and chandeliers ? are other features self-consciously copied from antiquity . Motifs . Military motifs take first place ( this is , after all , a Napoleonic style ) . Roman and , to a lesser extent , Greek motifs are borrowed indiscriminately and applied to furniture , fabrics , rugs , and architecture alike . Most popular motifs are : the sword , the shield , torches , Roman  | fasces ( a bundle of rods bound around an axle ) , palm leaves , laurel wreaths , eagles , swans ( traditionally , Josephine 's favorite ) , triumphal winged victories or dancing girls , heads of Apollo or other gods , cornucopias , and a variety of animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely popular device is the use of female caryatids ( standing human figures ) which support a variety of tops , from consoles to mantels . Egyptian motifs were a brief fad ? reflecting Napoleon 's campaign ? the lotus , sphinx , and human figures borrowed from the Nile . They do not appear too much today in antiques and are not often reproduced . Colors . Empire colors are strong . Some of them are harsh and blatant by today 's standards , yet many of them are used now for dramatic effect and for powerful contrast . Intense yellow was the color most used and it is still very effective , particularly in today 's dark apartments . Concentrated greens , reds , purples , and blues are also appropriate . Materials . Fabrics are usually lavish in content . Plain silks , brocades , damasks , lampas , satins , and velvets are used for the maximum effect . There is nothing retiring about the Empire style . A certain amount of embroidered mull or muslin was used to drape beds or bedroom windows , and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in similar arrangements . Toiles de Jouy were redesigned away from eighteenth-century pastorals in a variety of ways , commemorating Napoleon 's regime and his favorite motifs . Wallpapers simulating classic drapery or architecture or classic subject matter are used on walls . In keeping with this style 's essential formality , floors are frequently left bare . If covered , Aubusson rugs , incorporating the motifs listed above , may be used in a variety of sizes . English Regency ( sometimes called " English Empire " ) ( 1811 ? 1820 ) Characteristics . English designers were governed by an independent interest in newly unearthed antiquities , as well as by the ? Ft ( Itch classic movement . Because more attention was paid to Greece and Asia Minor than to Rome as design sources , the English interpretation came out in a  | more controlled form . Skyrocketing cost of living was used as an additional reason for simplification and corner-cutting . But perhaps the most lasting effect on the design world of the Regency period was the demand for " design for living " furniture which suited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unusual number of imaginative pieces which were highly flexible in purpose as well as graceful in appearance . Names to remember : Thomas Hope , the master designer of the best in Regency furniture ; Sir John Soane , Regency 's most influential architect ; and Paul Storr , the period 's greatest silversmith . Furniture . At the outset , it should be understood that cost has much to do with style in the Regency period ( named after George III 's son , appointed regent for his father , who was declared insane in 1811 ) . Three grades of furniture were made for three quite different markets : the first grade uses the best workmanship , the most superlative materials ; the next , while not so elaborate and ambitious in design , is still based on good craftsmanship and elements ; the third class is of distinctly lower standard , both in execution and material . These distinctions are important to remember in judging the worth of any Regency piece to you ,  | either as an original or as a reproduction thereof . " Regency " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorative furnishings of oftentimes quite dissimilar design and worth . A notable difference between Regency pieces and objects and the classic taste in other countries is their preoccupation with practicality . The emphasis in English furniture of this period is on graceful as well as serviceable units which often perform a dual or a triple purpose . Much of the furniture is on casters for greater mobility ; much of it is light and portable . Movable bookcases revolve ; small tables come in space-saving nests ; all-purpose tables often have a lift-up top to transform them into tables for cards , backgammon , checkers , or chess . Tables and chairs are often little and light , and are deliberately designed for moving about . The convex mirror is the dominant type , often surmounted by an eagle , or a dolphin , or a sea horse ( the last two to recall Lord Nelson and his sea victories ) . Circular-top furniture leads to a breakdown of formality , especially in dining . In general , Regency pieces are simpler in detail and ornament than similar French furniture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the typical circular , marble-topped table on a pedestal base , used in both countries ) . Until you are very familiar with all types of furnishings in England and France , do n't expect to differentiate these look-alikes at a glance . If they serve your purpose , it is only a collector 's concern whether one or the other table is English or French . And do not he confused by some eccentric pieces designed during the Regency period  --   --  the so-called " zoological " furniture , using animals ,  | reptiles , and fish , life-size , as symbolic motifs . These were not typical , or even usual . The woods most favored for first grade Regency pieces are mahogany and rosewood , in finely figured veneers . Satinwood , zebrawood , Amboina , and tulipwood are less used . Ornament , in the best pieces , consists of ormolu mounts . But often , to save cost , the same motif appears in carved wood , gilded in burnished gold , or unpolished . Sometimes carving is painted gray-green to imitate antique bronze . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is highly typical . Inlays in ebony , ivory , and steel are variations . Second-grade furniture lacks the extra finish in carving and chasing , and superfine gilding . Veneers are not so finely figured . Third-grade pieces are distinguished by their cheapness . They imitate mahogany and rosewood in stained beech and painted deal . Beech is commonly painted black , cream , yellow , green , or blue , as well as simulating satinwood or , more commonly , rosewood . Seats in such chairs are usually caned , and , as such , are light , casual , and informal . Now , as then , this type of piece is used as a comparatively inexpensive , colorful accent . Motifs . Regency motifs are more classic , in the pure sense , and less militaristic than the French . They are used sparingly , are carefully spotted , and are integrated into the design of a piece with more discrimination than is often found in comparable pieces of the period in France . The panther 's head is a favorite , together with his legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , lions ' and rams ' heads were also much used , and were ideally executed in crisp carving . Ormolu , though used much less than in France , in some ways has a more telling effect , because of its discreet placement and its bolder and simpler subject matter , such as the very common Greek honeysuckle , or anthemion . Regency motifs were usually based on the Greek rather than the Roman , and , as such , have more restraint than their counterparts across the channel . The English fondness for sphinx , Egyptian figures , and obelisks takes forms similar to French models , and their use of caryatids is a trait they share in common with the French . Colors . Regency colors can never be confused with any others in this period . They range surprisingly from a spectrum of great subtlety ? pea green , beige , gray , and much sand , for instance ? to strikingly brilliant and sharp contrasts ? poison green and chalk white , viridian and bright magenta , Chinese pink and caustic blue , mustard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , terra cotta , buff , and rose arc also extremely popular Regency colors . Golds arc dulled and antiqued , in contradistinc- tion to the often vulgar , raw gold of the French Empire . Deep , strong blues , so popular with Napoleon , were not used . Nothing obvious is ever a good Regency color scheme . Materials . Regency fabrics , in colors as listed above , are characteristically used in contrasting textures . Muslin or gauze is combined with heavy and sheer silks . Satin , taffetas , and other light , feminine fabrics are preferred , and are used in enormous quantities . Regency drapery treatments are some of the most elaborate ever designed and as many as five or six overcurtains or swags are common ? in as many different colors . A typical Regency window admits a maximum of light ; panes are larger than ever before , and the muntins which divide them are as refined as possible . Walls are severely stripped of detail ; projections and reveals are as flat as possible . All this makes for an ideal background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually smaller in scale than the French ( an example would be the typical rosette ) , but are derived from similar sources . The heavier materials are finished with elaborate gimps , braids , and fringes . Rugs and carpets of the Aubusson type , in classic patterns , were sometimes designed to repeat the ceiling detail of a room . But floors ( again in imitation of the antique ) are frequently left bare , but are inlaid in classic designs , either in wood or terrazzo . Biedermeier ? Empire in Germany and Austria ( 1800 ? 1820 ) Characteristics . The chief force which governed Biedermeier was a widespread national poverty as an aftermath of the Napoleonic wars .  | Bourgeois comfort and simplicity replaced pomp . A second influence was England ( in marked competition to France ) ? hence the emphasis on practicality and comfort . A word of warning : Biedermeier is not the name of a cabinetmaker , but the name of a comic-strip character ( " Papa Biedermeier " ) , who symbolized the new , simple style , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taste of i800 to 182o in Germany and Austria . In its early form it is a diminished and very severely censored interpretation of French Empire . It followed Greek ideals of purity , rather than Roman extravagance . Its lines are straight and clean , its moldings are uncomplicated , and its surfaces are almost unbroken by projections . Hence , Biedermeier recalls much of the simple modern furniture of today . This likeness is emphasized by the fact that both styles use predominantly light woods . If you like the scale and the weight of Empire , but find it too rich , investigate Biedermeier . For this style was originally created for a society that wanted comfort and simplicity . There are no useless or luxurious pieces in the Biedermeier style . A large sofa , seating three or four , and a monumental secretary are the dominating notes in a typical room . Chairs vary greatly in style and arc very useful today . middle splits are carved in a number of designs , such as the lyre , two  | conected cornucopias , oval medallions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairs . Rectangular legs , either tapered or concave , are most common ; turned or carved legs are rare . A typical table has an oval or round top on a pedestal supported by carved feet . Biedermeier is an intimate style ; therefore sewing tables , whatnots , and nests of tables are common . But by far the greatest aid in recognizing Biedermeier pieces is the combination of typical Empire outlines with light and simple woods . Cherry , finished in its natural , ruddy-golden color , is the favorite . Birch , apple , and pear are also much used . Walnut burl veneers are used , with contrasting trim in mahogany , or even more usually with black paint simulating too costly ebony . Motifs . Simplified and abstracted classic motifs are used , though the variety of French Empire or even English Regency is lacking . Extravagance of workmanship or design does n't appear , nor elaborate carving , gilding , or metal appliques . Colors . Biedermeier colors resemble Empire . They are often strong and raw . But charming exceptions are jewel tones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not found in other neoclassic styles . Materials . Plainer and cheaper materials are used , in less contrast and variety than in other countries . Muslin and gauze are frequently employed along with intricate fringes , or sometimes combined with satin , taffeta , and other silks . Small , flowered designs are favorites , along with stripes and patterns in small scale . Plaids appear late in the period . Wallpaper is extremely popular ( it is almost impossible to think of a Biedermeier room without it ) and takes the place of an architectural cornice or paneling in many rooms . In general it is bold in pattern and in color . Floors are usually covered , wall-to-wall , in heavily figured Brussels carpeting in a striking treatment . As the period progressed , pattern became more important than simplicity , and hominess replaced classical severity .  | Characteristics . Napoleon 's domination of Italy during this period was complete , both socially and politically . As early as 1797 he had established a court in Milan , and as his fortunes progressed , he handed out principalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French court styles were naturally encouraged , and , though smaller , Italian courts attempted the pomp and ostentation of Paris . The greatest difference resulted from the Italians ' general lack of money necessary to duplicate exactly French ideas . The Italian Empire style is closer to the French than any other , for obvious reasons . Its greatest dissimilarity is in materials used and in execution . Lack of wealth and a typical Italian fondness for brilliant color combine to produce painted furniture and decoration with more imagination and charm ( and sometimes drama ) than the more sober French interpretations . Native walnut is substituted for the too costly mahogany used in France , and carved and gilded wood take the place of metal mounts of ormolu , for the same reason . Decorative ideas and forms arc freer than in French models , but they have the disadvantage of being less expertly crafted . Motifs . In general , motifs are less aggressive and less militaristic than the French . Italian Empire , unlike the French style , is not a national product . An enormous variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the district ( or even the city ) from which a piece comes . The Florentines respected finesse of execution ; the Genoese and the Milanese liked a profusion of gilt ornament ; the Venetians preferred color ; the Neapolitans were influenced by Spain and by England  | ( during Lord Hamilton 's residence as ambassador to the court of Naples ) . Colors . Strong color was the norm , as in France , with the addition of purely Italian variety . Materials . Fabrics are similar to French Empire examples , both in weave and in treatment , whether used as drapery or upholstery . Characteristics . The Greek style , as adapted to American soil , was the national style from the 1820 's until the Civil War . Climate was disregarded in assimilating Greek models , and achitecture made few if any concessions to location , whether it was found in the humid lower Mississippi territory , the more even temperatures of Ohio , or the extremes of New England . The opening up of the West marked the beginning of a number of great American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many others . New wealth created a demand for new homes , and the classic revival of the earlier Federal era developed logically from a Roman to a purer Greek expression which gained impetus with national interest in the war for Greek independence of 1824 , plus the feeling that Greek models somehow symbolized a new , vigorous democracy . As a style , the Greek Revival in America was cold and ponderous  | and was largely unsuited for residential use . A house became an antique Greek temple with added wings , whether built of stone , brick , or wood . Plans were completely symmetrical , and walls , inside and out , simulated the antique . Background . At its best , the Greek Revival style turned away from the elaboration of Adam-Roman surface decoration toward a greater dignity and simplicity , largely influenced by English Regency , and only secondarily by France . Interior ornament consisted of antique columns , pilasters , and cornices executed in wood or plaster . Mantels and trims imitated marble , and characteristically wide openings between rooms were closed off by great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marble was used as much as possible , where it was indicated ( as in mantels ) . Interiors have a new spaciousness , as well as a kind of sober formality . Motifs . Many motifs were continued on from the Federal period , made coarse in carving and higher in relief . Reeding ? in keeping with the new simplicity ? was still popular . The lyre , the lion 's paw and mask , bold acanthus scrolls and leaves , and other French Empire motifs of a nonmilitaristic kind are lifted from French-Roman sources . The only fantasies ? sphinxes , griffons , and winged caryatids ? usually appear on pieces of furniture designed by Frenchmen who emigrated to the United States . Colors . Pure white walls are very popular , especially in the Greek Revival period . In keeping with richer woods and more vigorous carving , strong colors are used as contrast : lemon yellow , tomato red , terra cotta or henna , and black . Furniture . Richly figured mahogany becomes almost the invari- able medium . Heavy moldings and naturalistic carving in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost the only decoration of merit in these later years . Some brass mounts are used ? lion masks are the most frequent ? and plain brass wire banding or inlay on table tops ( like the Regency ) . At the end of the period , gold stenciling is a rich effect , cheaply gotten ( gilt stenciling appeared in many other and more sophisticated places than on Hitchcock chairs ) . Marble and alabaster are increasingly used in columns for consoles or as console tops , as the period progresses . Scale and weight continue to increase , and coarseness of carving degenerates at the end into the crudities of Victorian naturalism . Materials . Fabrics common to French Empire interiors were popular in America as well . Wall-to-wall carpeting makes its appearance , usually in the shape of a Brussels weave , in strong geometric patterns which suggest classic mosaic floors . Victorian , as a decorative period , lasted from 1837 to 1901 , and its phases were obviously not all of an identical character over so long a time . We think of Victorian as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a date coinciding with the Great Crystal Palace Exhibition of 1851 in England in which the world 's goods were shown in the first world 's fair . Properly , Victorian should be broken up into early Victorian , midVictorian , and the nineties . It was an international style which was  | A typical mid-Victorian table starts with Louis XV forms and details but coarsens the proportions and carving . copied and adapted in France and Germany , and America ; and however national expressions varied , their roots were in England . Victorian today is fashionably derided as an incongruous mixture of over-ornamentation and realism , of crass vulgarity of detail , and of bad quality of execution , blamed on the machine age and the separation of client and craftsman . The typical Victorian consumer had little sense of tradition , little education , and little leisure from commerce to develop a discriminating taste . Yet , as a style , Victorian set its mark so firmly on decoration that it can scarcely be swept out the door without a backward glance . Many average homes today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are well-made and well-designed within the framework . Like all the periods , Victorian has its best to offer , and , if you look for that aspect and accept its limitations , you can be  | quite happy with some items which the rest of the world would throw out . The best Victorian furniture was comfortable , above all , and its woods were often magnificently rich . It has a friendly , homey look to it , and if it has been a family friend for so long , there is often no reason why it ca n't continue to be ? if it 's good . Its whimsicalities of scrambled designs and scrambled periods are often amusing and naively charming in today 's correct interiors , and if you understand the why 's of such vagaries you will go a long way toward re-examining the worth of Victorian as a style . Characteristics . The mid-Victorian period aimed always at the grand manner at cut-corner prices . Commercialism of all the decorative crafts in the 50 's and 60 's managed to bring a semblance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the order of the day . Architectural details meant only for stone were reproduced cheaply in cast iron or tin ; exotic woods and inlays were faked ; carving was glued on to plain carcasses . The periods were hopelessly scrambled , though Gothic came through as perhaps the purest . Other influences were Baroque , Greek , Turkish , Persian , and later , Japanese . Background . The typical early Victorian parlor was crowded with furniture and with detail . Its two tall windows were thickly covered in heavy draperies hanging from elaborate cornices or poles . The details of carving were intricate and clumsy at the same time , and usually realistic in content . A boldly figured Brussels carpet commonly ran wall-to-wall . Accessories were all over , in profusion , and marble was a necessity in mantels and on table tops of all kinds . Rosewood and ebonized woods , and papier-mache furniture were the chief favorites . Furniture was often in suites . There was a horror of vacancy , and every bare spot was carefully filled with an object , however meaningless in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated in molded plaster , and from it might hang a chandelier for oil or gas , in cast iron , painted or gilded . Walls were commonly papered , often with crimson flock paper , in imitation of cut velvet , or they might be stretched with fabric . Motifs . The early to mid-Victorian period took its motifs where it found them , from any period , and from any country , as well as from nature . Because motifs were borrowed with little analysis of their original significance , they were often transposed in a tasteless or grotesque way . But it is perfectly possible to find many cases where a mixture of motifs is charming and amusing , because it is done in a naive and ingenuous  | manner , without much preconceived or logical plan . Whatever Victorian furniture is , it can never be accused of being too correct . Colors . As the period progressed , colors became richer , and darker . Early Victorian colors are lighter and brighter ( as was logical , following as they do in chronological order after similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward VII , Victoria 's son , had come to the throne , they had described a full cycle and were fresh and pale again . Aniline dyes were discovered in 1856 , and the fashionable world went wild over the variety of possible hues . Colors were commonly contrasted as much as possible , such as a light with a dark . And raw colors and color combinations , such as magenta , and rich purple with orange , were popular . Furniture . Furniture was of two kinds : expensive and real , or cheap and faked . Rosewood was a favorite , because of its magnificence , and so were other woods in dark or even black finishes . Ornament and beauty were synonymous , so that carving was a must . The details of design and of carving could be borrowed from anywhere . With the new Gothic revival ( there had been an earlier vogue for Gothic in England about 1745 , and again under the Regency ) , beds , chairs , and mirrors of this style were pierced with tracery like a church window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There might even be a touch of imitation , such as " distressed oak , " to simulate great age . Materials . The average house used reps in dark reds and greens for drapery and upholstery . More pretentious interiors used satin and plush . Windows were hung in several layers of curtaining , voluminously cut . Two sets of glass curtains were common , and all draperies were lined and interlined . Other upholstery fabrics were needlework , woolwork , and velvet , painted or otherwise . Chenille and woolen fringes were common , as well as the more luxurious silk . The use of many cushions was high fashion , as well as ottomans and footstools covered in lush fabrics , and fringe . William Morris , in 1853 , led a movement away from eclecticism toward decorative honesty and a revival of the crafts as against the factory system . He advocated a return to simplicity of construction and functionalism . Elaborate carvings , turnings and moldings were discarded in his lexicon , and instead he used a suggestion of natural forms to give a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fabrics . Unfortunately , Morris looked backward to the guild system of the Middle Ages , and his battle with the inevitable machine was never won . His in- fluence was comparatively negligible . ( The Morris chair , by the way , is not his design . ) Charles Eastlake 's " Hints on Household Taste " of 1872 Another English champion of the simple style ( with rather more success , especially in America ) was Charles Eastlake . He advocated a  | new simplicity and a return to unconcealed function , washable fabrics that hung straight , and straight lines in furniture . His good ideas were perverted , paradoxically , in cheap , machine-made copies , and his message was largely lost . He was still interested , like Morris , in Gothic , but he wanted to revive the spirit of the workmanship of past times , not the forms . For his rectangular , straight lines , he went largely to early Tudor , and some early Renaissance . His incised , shallow carved details were usually applied to light oak . Like Morris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such innovations as metal beds . By the 70 's and 80 's , expansion of the British Empire had given the design world a new impetus . Moorish , Indian , Turkish , and Persian motifs were the rage . Whistler 's ( the famous American artist lived in England ) Japanese fan started a vogue for an Anglo-Japanese style . Whistler , by the way , was the first to plead for completely plain walls in light colors , a suggestion which hardly anyone took up . By the 1880 's , early Victorian was considered outmoded . Old-fashioned furniture was being masked in draperies , shawls , and fringed table covers . French fashions were strong , and a new lightness helped to pave the way for later Edwardian frivolities of ribbons and bows . Among new furniture pieces was the little , delicate , gilded chair , caned , or upholstered and fringed . And bamboo became the new style note . In the 90 's there was an inexplicable revival for Louis XVI , and for Louis XIV and boulle work . Straight lines were accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hardly could be called simple by us today , although they seemed so to their fashionable owners . With this vogue went a revival of Italian Renaissance , in which motifs were picked out iii brightly contrasting colors . Massive suites in ebonized wood , with heavy  | carving , or mahogany , or walnut veneer , were the norm . In the bedroom , new pieces like the bureau , chiffonier , and wardrobe , all " went with " the tremendous bed with its towering headboard . High walls , which were natural with high ceilings , were now broken down in an effort to arrive at simplicity . Between a dado and a frieze , walls might be tooled leather , imitation Siena marble , tapestry , lacquer panels , tiles , matting , or just plain paint . Above the frieze was usually an elaborate cornice , and above that an extremely elaborate ceiling , painted and paneled ( the negation of the new " restraint " ) . The incised motif instead of the carved motif became the standard , and part of the simpler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming in content and with straighter lines . No small part of late Victorian decoration was contributed by hand-painted , hand-embroidered touches by the women of the family . Everything possible ? and impossible ? was prettied up . Under Louis Philippe , in the 30 's and 40 's , French designers copied British ideas of comfort . A typical French piece was carefully overstuffed . Empire styles were naturally strong , and Egyptian , Pompeian , and Roman forms , typical of the First Empire , were adapted to new ideas . In 1837 , the Committee of Historic Monuments swung public interest around to a study of the past . Distorted " Roman , " synthetic " Louis XIV " and " Louis XVI , " crowded " Henri II , " and " Louis XIII , " a strange  | kind of French " Gothic , " mixed incongruously with the prevailing international taste for Moorish , Persian and Arabian products . A typically French delight of the period was bright gilding . It was used as much as possible . Louis Napoleon ( Napoleon III ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with new energy , as well as a solid emphasis on opulent , overstuffed comfort . The Empress Eugenie sponsored a revival of Louis XVI ( she identified herself , in some way , with the ill-starred Marie Antoinette ) . Cast zinc and imitation marble simulated a luxury that was n't there . The favorite seating unit was the one with no framework showing . Tufting was carried to the wall in cheap papers . Cast iron accessories masqueraded as bronze or brass , and electroplating had been invented to replace solid silver . Colors were bright and bold . White and gold were popular , and crimson ? for instance ? was often added for greater contrast . Different rooms were supposed to be keyed differently according to their function ( an idea accepted in both England and America ) . Boudoirs might be all pale blue satin or pink : dining rooms and drawing rooms were often scarlet . New fabrics were imitations of Persian and Indian prints , and Aubussons were commonly reproduced .  | French carving tended to outdo English in super-realism of detail . Animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief , and often life-size . The America of the 1830 's , when Victoria came to the throne , was content with a heritage of 18th century furniture and traditions . The Greek Revival style had hardly been dented by the Gothic propagandists . After the Civil War , however , elegance came into its own . Early Victorian and Gothic had made their impression , and the trend was now toward a modified Louis XV ( called the " French style " ) . John Belter , a famous New York cabinetmaker , was its best exponent . Building up layers of laminated wood , in a revolutionary method , Belter worked as early as the 1840 's in rosewood , which permitted deep carving and an extraordinary amount of openwork . His work was sent all over the country , and set the standards of good taste for many a home . Eastlake , already mentioned as an English innovator , was a tremendous American success in the 70 's ( his book ran to six editions ) , and the wildest baroque scrolls were toned down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Americans borrowed from all over Europe , and crossed all styles to their own personal uses . A single pure American  | innovation that came into its own ( it had been used by the Shakers ) was the rocking chair . The Philadelphia Centennial and International Exposition of 1876 was generally considered a turning point in all American home furnishings . Many Americans from all over the nation saw European products brought to their doorstep , at first hand , for the first time . A bewildering array of the world 's goods was there for the copying , or the inspiration . Japanese became a vogue , and bamboo the rage from the Orient . Japanese folding screens and portieres were a necessity . And , of course , the fan . New motifs were the sunflower , iris , bulrush , and long-stemmed lily , together with the Japanese heron . Oscar Wilde , when he came to lecture in America , had preached the gospel of Art For Art 's Sake . Furniture was mongrel Empire , Louis Philippe , and Second Empire , plus " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new Eastlake Gothic , which was n't Gothic at all . Colors did a right-about-face to low tones . Bold primaries were not as fashionable as rust and ochre , peacock blue , citron , olive , and an ubiquitous sage green . Aspidistra and ferns were the recognized plants for interior decoration . In the 80 's and 90 's old styles continued , but a strange new novelty was the studio type of decoration . This required that shawls be thrown negligently over everything , from mantels to screens . Cattails and peacock feathers were arranged in stiff still lifes and combined with ceramics and bric-a-brac . Easels and models ' screens were a necessary part of this decor , and so was a Turkish " cozy corner , " occupied by that new piece of furniture , the divan . The World 's Columbian Exposition , in Chicago in 1893 , boldly stated a return to Greece and Rome , at least as far as architecture was concerned . The products shown , however , were the same old adaptations . A saturation point had been reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1893 , was an abortive attempt to strike out for a fresh style . It had some success in Europe , but never went far in America . The nearest approach to a decorative revolt in this country was the socalled " Mission " style , which was heavy and rectangular , and simple . I t bore little resemblance to the real furniture of the Spanish colonials of the Southwest , or of California , but its furniture was , in a sense , a step in the direction of modern . Its insistence , however , that all decoration he a prevailing light or dark brown was unfortunate , drab , and .  | If you are working with a period room you can treat your draperies in three ways : pattern them exactly on designs of the period you are working in , adapt and simplify authentic designs , or use simple , straighthanging modern treatments . Obviously , you will use one approach as against the other depending only on how authoritative you want to be . Any one of the three methods will be decoratively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatments from the past may be used as is , if they are simple enough . But the majority will be interpreted and adapted . There are so many available documents from which to select that there is little excuse for being repetitious or trite , and a little time spent on original research will provide ideas for your home which are fresh and completely unhackneyed . Documentary drapery treatments come from contemporary records of the past . Try to find the original source , in every case . The result will be more personally yours alone . These documents are found in two places : in the backgrounds of portraits , or genre paintings , or prints and in eighteenth and nineteenth century upholsterers ' design books . The best for your purpose are usually English or French , since these countries have always had the greatest influence on American design . A curtain in its simplest period form is seen in many seventeenth century Dutch interiors by painters such as De Hooch and Vermeer . It is usually a length of material on a rod , pulled by hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlers in America who , like the Dutch , were interested in simplicity and functionalism . After all , the primary purpose of window curtains was and is a protection against drafts and cold air , and as a regulator of light . It is hard to realize that originally such an obvious convenience as a divided curtain was looked upon as a novelty . Yet in the second half of the seventeenth century curtains in pairs were still something new . Some of the earliest upholsterers ' designs still used and adapted come from the works of Daniel Marot , upholsterer to the English court of William and  | Mary , whose designs , with their lavish use of braid , were usually simple , bold , and effective , and easily adapted to present day use . In the seventeenth century , elaborate bed hangings were repeated with window treatments which matched , and window draperies may be taken from bed designs of this period . Early eighteenth century curtain designs for English rooms may be found in a number of prints and paintings , such as those by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simpler , straight-hanging draperies of sheerer material , like taffeta , hung inside the window trim , without a valance . These may be adapted for present-day use in French rooms or English . By the middle of the 18th century , Chippendale was showing one plate in his Director where cornices for beds and windows were designed to be carved and not covered . But elsewhere in his catalogue he shows drapery treatments on beds where cornices were covered in fabric , and the whole was intended to be done in fabric from head to foot . This was a fashion which antedated Chippendale , and he was too good a businessman to discard all old ideas for the latest fashion on a whim . By the third quarter of the eighteenth century , cloth covered valances were abandoned altogether in favor of cornices of painted and gilded wood , and straight-hanging curtains were discarded for those which were caught up in cascades with cords and tassels in a variety of ways . Robert Adam , in particular , tried to get away from the fussy cornices of the rococo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Draping of the curtains themselves was flatter and less intricate . Toward the end of the century such emphasis on restraint and delicacy was more and more lost sight of in a preoccupation with clabora- tion . Involved and heavy window treatments were favored by interior designers , and , of course , by upholsterers . This turn of the tide caught up even such a sober designer as Sheraton , and his drawings progressively , more and more , smothered windows in swags and folds as the new Regency style gained favor . As the 19th century begins , there is a great deal more information published specifically on the making and hanging of draperies . According to Sheraton , festoon curtains ( those drawn up by pulleys ) were less favored in his time than straight-hanging curtains , which were considered modern . In the first quarter of the nineteenth century , Hope , Ackermann , George Smith , and Nicholson , and many other designers published works on decorating in England . But the French influence was paramount . The world in general took up classicism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among other things , as a revolt against the old regime . There was much talk of doing away with the heavy effects of a cornice . Yet this style was full of pitfalls , since pole ends became more and more conspicuous , and the poles became heavier . The fabrics themselves were contrasted in material and in color , and three or more different fabrics combined at a window was a common practice . This type of drapery treatment was often placed against a  | severely plain and bare wall , however , and some of its drama was enhanced by this deliberate contrast . They can be simplified and adapted today to rooms of the same type . During the later years of the nineteenth century , Victorian massiveness took over for good , and Eastlake protested in 1868 that curtains were made immoderately long in order to be looped up in a clumsy way .  | He advocated straight-hanging , simple draperies , as substitutes , and his great influence in England and America helped to swing the pendulum of style over to the greater simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even a hasty glance through photographs of interiors of the past fifty years will point up the fact that styles in interior design change very slowly ? and fashions and fads have a way of getting lost in the shuffle . In the late Thirties , Baroque was the mode . Only three years later , Regency was being cried up as the aristocrat of American styles . Unlike fashions in clothes , such violent shifts in taste in the home are unlikely in so short a length of time ? and certainly undesirable . The people who pay decorating bills and live in decorated houses seem to cling stubbornly to a few well-tried periods ? if periods are to their liking . At the turn of this century , the term " decorator " still meant little or nothing . The titans in architecture , such as Richardson , Hunt , and Stanford White , in America , were the important professionals , and they spread the gospel of the Ecole des Beaux Arts ? a kind of magnificent derivative architecture to all who had the money to listen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Blois , near Asheville , North Carolina , or a Venetian palazzo front the Grand Canal , and a number of Louis XVI houses set down in New York City , are now  | fashionably deplored . Yet it is well to remember that the knowledge of scale , mass , and proportion , and detailing which went into such jobs is often lacking in present day interiors . A long look back also reminds us of two other factors in interior design : a good interior is very often as good twenty or thirty years later ; and many a style heralded as springing full-born from the head of some designer has often quite an ancient lineage . The vogue of the all-white room has been credited to three world-famous designers in three decades . Actually , seventeenth century memoirs have quite a bit to say about all white , velvet bedrooms , and the fashion doubtless goes back much farther . Just so with a 1949 style called " Chinese Modern . " The grand manner was being imitated in every country by borrowing from every source , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logical heir of all the historic past . In England , houses were based on Elizabethan or Jacobean models , complete to mullioned windows and steep roofs . In America , Italian and French Renaissance , Regence and Louis XV were often combined in one house , in a casual juxtaposition typical of many interiors . Walls in a room were often copied from one documentary European source , the ceiling from another , and door details from a third . In 1907 , Elsie de Wolfe became the first famous modern decorator , with her job at New York 's Colony Club .  | The taste in America for European antiques was insatiable . Whole Tudor houses were bought in England and transported brick by brick . Italian Medieval and Renaissance collections were brought over in boatloads and dispersed all over the country . Modernism at the 1913 Armory Show in New York was greeted with more jeers than cheers . In Europe , Art Nouveau , as a new movement , had had a temporary vogue in the world of interior design until 1910 . Originating in Brussels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to get away from derived forms and historic ornament . It failed , largely because it was interested primarily in surface decoration ( as was the case with the eighteenth century rococo style ) , though its plastic and sculptural forms taken from nature , its freedom and irregularity , and its preoccupation with delicate and sensitive curved lines , has an interesting echo in furniture of the 1950 's . The new International Style , preoccupied with the problems of the machine age , was born in 1914 . In 1919 the Bauhaus was opened as the great new center of creative design in Europe . In America , war , and post-war extravagance could afford to decorate with a lavish hand , which was often generous to a fault . The field of interior decoration multiplied and grew , with practitioners from coast to coast eager to serve a myriad of clients who bought first and considered later . Two events , poles apart , were the chief new decorative influences in America , in this period . In 1925 , L'Exposition des Arts Decoratifs opened in Paris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to modernism . From this event stemmed a movement which has persisted to the present day , in France , at least . It was self-conscious and superficial design , taken up with boxy forms and an overabundance of inlay in geometric , conventionalized designs . The American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art , in New York , opened in the same year , and attempted to bring the cabinetwork and interior architecture of our seventeenth , eighteenth , and nineteenth century native designers to the attention of a public steeped in Italian , English , French , and Spanish lore . This event , coupled with the publication of a continuing series of books on the subject , had a lasting effect on American interiors , for the very good reason that it popularized a style which could be adapted to any purse , large or small , and yet look well . And it was indigenous .  | In a world which had taken to play-acting , it was fashionable to have a half-timbered house ( Elizabethan , or Tudor , or Cotswold ) ; or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a dovecote over the garage ; or an Italian villa fresh from the hill towns ; or , if you were one who fell for the Florida boom , all of Spain was yours to adapt and distort . The fashionable world went to the Riviera , which was not exactly modern in architecture or decor , but in passing through Europe something called " moderne " attracted those daring and rich enough to be experimental . Transplanted to America , this new modern look provoked the gibes of the old guard . A truly influential and serious movement was the International Style of Le Corbusier ( " the house is a machine to live in " ) , Gropius , and Mies van der Rohe , which developed around 1925 . As a post-war style , it looked to the future , accepted the machine as a friend , and turned its back on all tradition , all ornament , all derivation . It went in for pure geometric shapes , and the severe beauty of abstract forms , structure , and natural contrasting textures . Its first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces in today 's decoration , in spite of early misunderstanding and opposition . The thirties rediscovered the elegance of the all-white room and the drama of the all-dark room . Contrast was the order of the day . Effects were unsubtle and dircct . Plaster became the rage , and continued over into the forties . The decorative world could n't make up its mind whether to be lush and baroque. , or severe and classic , or stark and metallic , and modern . Two World 's lairs ( in Chicago and New York ) presented  | Regency and Swedish Modern cheek by jowl , and Modern was a bad loser . Regency was the answer to everyone 's dream of luxury ? it was plentiful ; if one had to have antiques , it was n't too expensive ; and , best of all , it straddled the question of how to be simple , and streamlined , and yet glamorous . Clients still hesitated before taking the plunge into modern . It had to be English modern , classic modern , Chinese modern , or some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idiom , without an explanation and an apology . The influence from France and Germany still attracted a few customers to metal , and leather , and " functionalism , " as defined by the International School . In 1927 , Mies van der Rohe had designed the first chair to use the spring quality of bent steel legs ( his chairs are still used and admired today ) . Le Corbusier had designed two types of comfortable tubular steel chairs which were produced in the late twenties and early thirties , for mass consumption . The thirties exploited bent plywood for the first time in chair construction , and by 1932 Aalto and Matthsson designs were in quantity production . Stacking chairs were new , and so was unit furniture ( later called " module , " or a number of other pseudonyms ) . Customers began to consider " American " as a style , and to investigate with a new appreciation purely native periods , such as " Federal , " and something vaguely called " Early American . " The living symbol of this conscious awakening was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first opened to the public in 1935 . This project influenced a large segment of the public as nothing else , through its sponsorship and sale of reproductions of furniture , paint colors and accessories , all authentic . As the shock of a financial depression wore off and the decade advanced , there was a new feeling for fantasy in decoration . Part of it was a matter of scaling , usually over-scaling ; part of it was a new use of materials , cerulean blue and candy pink plaster tables , great clouds of marbleized taffeta caught up at windows , and everywhere walls and walls of mirror , and mirrored furniture to fool the eye , and create a never-never land of illusion . Such was the stuff of the theatre , which was carried into the home . One lone designer ventured to present a picture of an interior , serene , uncluttered , and without period ? T. H. Robsjohn-Gibbings . His interiors were backgrounds reduced to the absolute minimum , in opposition to the type of decoration which clamored more and more for atten- tion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or designer . Actually , they had more than a bowing acquaintance with Egypt , Greece , and Rome , and the earliest cultures of the Far East . The decade opened with two decorative styles in the ascendant , Victorian and Regency . The sets for the film Gone with the Wind were Victorian at its best and were theatrical symptoms of a romantic revival . The fuss and profusion of objects , typical of Victorian Americana , added more clutter to rooms as the decade advanced , and the outlines of any specific period became more hazy . Some designers were still doing modified traditional , in lieu of straight modern . Cramped space produced a vogue for mirrored walls , often antiqued for no very good reason . Suddenly Pearl Harbor cut the nation off on all decorative counts . There were no imports , no materials to be made up , and plenty of regulations and restrictions on building and interior design . The Western Hemisphere assumed a new importance , since travel was restricted to it . The American heritage was in for a new patriotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received more attention than ever before in American cultural history . Modern began to be given more consideration and experimentation . In 1940 , Charles Eames and Eero Saarinen won the Museum of Modern Art 's first prize in a contest for " Organic Design , " with their entry of three molded plywood chairs of revolutionary design . Their chairs , built up of layers of plastic glue and wood veneers , were molded in threedimensional forms , in the first of a present-day trend toward lightness in furniture . Free form in everything was a new design force . Whole rooms , ceilings , rugs , fabrics , and wallpapers echoed the forms typical of an abstract artist and sculptor like Arp , whose bulging curved forms were contrasted with the coldly intellectual geometry of an artist like Mondrian , who established a style in painting using arrangements of pure line and pure color , all intersecting at ninety degree angles . Modern was becoming more varied , more casual and more human . Modern , today , is a style which has passed the acceptance stage . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it has centered its  | attention , in the very recent past , on better proportion , better lines , better scale , and better color . Above all , the best of today 's modern no longer shouts for attention . Part of modern 's new manner is to be suave , wellmannered , and unobtrusive . Striving for effect in architecture , in furniture , in fabrics , wall covering , floor coverings , and accessories very quickly results in a very dated look . It is important to avoid what have come to be major cliches such as the **36;2794;TOOLONG school of thought , or the packing-case , functional , empty room of the clinical modernists . The majority of American contemporary interiors look warm and comfortable , and fresh . Today 's modern does not look regimented , if you handle it properly . Beware of formulas , such as the inevitable rubber plant in a corner you do n't know what to do with ; or the " no-color " room with one brilliant , colorful spot ; or the self-conscious placing of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a Mondrian-like , static arrangement of pictures and accessories . Colors can be a formula too , if you use nothing but primaries . Above all , remember that the display rooms are done by contemporary designers to show off a new season 's furniture . These rooms are formula rooms , deliberately designed for eye-catching appeal . They are not relaxed , or livable , as a rule . For one thing , all the furniture in a display room will be from one manufacturer , and usually in one color or tone of wood . The designers who create these sets arc working for a public effect . They would probably work quite differently in your home . Your modern room will not be likely to follow suit , if you want it to have individuality .  | In choosing modern furniture , you go back to the very fundamentals of design as a yardstick . Face the fact squarely that your biggest problem is likely to be avoiding a furniture formula . For , no matter how you consider it , much of the modern furniture on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminiscent , one of the other . Copying is nothing new in furniture ? the best eighteenth century designers did it all the time and today 's furniture similarly borrows from itself , from designers in other countries , and from the past , with little or no acknowledgment . This is one reason for modern furniture looking alike enough to be in danger of becoming monotonous . Another , more vital reason is the fact that there is little variety provided by ornament , simply because there is no ornament , carved or inlaid , in most of the best modern furniture . The justly celebrated Eames chair has been seen in such quantities that it is already too much seen . The same is more or less true of large groups of undecorated , unembellished furniture turned out each year by " name " designers . They are instantly made familiar to millions throughout the country , by means of simultaneous publicity releases and magazine and department store promotions . Such individuality as there is to this furniture is provided by line and proportion , rarely by distinctive ornament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor coverings . The variety here is staggering , and just about the only guide is your own native sense of the fitness of things for your own home . Here , again , the well-designed product will usually stand out because of its integrity . Avoid trick patterns which are self-consciously modern , and beware of fads , such as the socalled " hairshirt look , " where coarse texture is the only interest in a fabric . Properly selected , fabrics and other secondary furnishings for your home will add more individuality than anything else to your over-all scheme in today 's world . So be very careful of the smaller as well as the greater purchases for your modern interior . Background . The most obvious radical change in architecture , which alters any thinking about today 's interiors , is the prevalence of the glass house type of thinking . For every wall of glass , there is one less wall against which to place furniture in the traditional way ? or accessories , for that matter . Furniture in such a room , or series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This influence of background on furniture design and room arrangement is intensified by the device known as the storage wall . A storage wall is very often a free-standing proposition , and often it opens on both sides . This means that no furniture may be placed on one or more sides of such an architectural unit . Both these features can , and do , provide entirely new problems of room arrangement , especially if your room is an all-purpose , living-dining-sleeping area , discussed in Part 6 . Motifs . Motifs , as such , do not really exist in modern decoration . A few symbols borrowed from surrealist painters , or the avant garde nonobjective school , do crop up in wallpapers and fabrics , but they are often experimental attempts at translating one medium into another . The best modern designs look equally well with a mixture of styles , and the less they can be categorized into a rigid design pigeonhole , the better . Motifs in modern decoration usually are attached to a name designer , not to the period . Thus , certain allover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being typical of Scandinavian modern , and a designer such as Bent Karlby . But these motifs would be almost equally at home with French Provincial , as a style . Another type of modern design motif stems from a new group of architect-designers , a rather arid scientific geometric combination of symbols . But here , again , these are identified with a person , or a school of thought , rather than with modern , as an over-all style . In other words , the modern motif can be almost anything , ranging from the most naturalistic drawing to the most abstract . Colors . Modern colors are generally thought of as fresh . This is only true of a certain group of designers , however , who insist on primary colors in sharp juxtaposition . The real criterion is that a modern color must never look muddy or dingy . The most subtle grayed tones are often used in the more elegant and sophisticated contemporary interiors . And , as a matter of fact , the brighter the color , the more it looks dated in today 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior is now a matter of very personal preference . It is not the colors themselves so much as the skill with which they are combined in an unhackneyed way . Furniture . Modern furniture is ? paradoxically ? looking more and more like traditional furniture , in the sense that fine craftsmanship , molded and sculptured lines , and lightness and sophisticated elegance are now the standards set by the best models . This furniture has a handcrafted look , though made by machine , quantity production . Typical of this type of modern furniture are the designs coming into America from Denmark and from Italy . In almost all cases , this furniture is created by  | architect-designers who presumably have a sound background of tradition behind them . Another type of modern furniture which is much in use is the kind which goes back to traditional American sources , such as Shaker , or the Windsor chair . Good examples of these types are certain groups designed by such men as Robsjohn-Gibbings , or Paul McCobb . Less obviously " designer " furniture are the numerous seasonal groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialize  | in good , clean lines , and a great deal of honest , deep-cushioned comfort . This furniture is characterized by more weight than the first two groups ? both visual and actual . This does not mean a return to the clumsy , overstuffed modern chair of the twenties and thirties . There is still some of that around , too , but it is easy to avoid . A small group of modern furniture has the formless or free-form look of many surrealist symbols . The Hardoy , or sling chair , is one of these , as well as the Eames chair in plywood , and the designs of the Japanese , Noguchi . A final category has been termed " The Machine Look . " This applies to a growing class of furniture which combines metal and plywood ? as the famous metal-legged Eames chair , and some of his later developments , as well as a group created by other designers . This school believes in exposing all structure , and subscribes to the theory that much beauty comes from plain , unadorned function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select of the lot exactly what fits your own particular requirements . There is no rule of thumb , again , except your sense of design fundamentals , and , of course , excellence of the execution of the finished product . Trends . Certain trends are apparent , even though modern furniture is in an experimental state : Much case furniture is being eliminated by new devices such as the storage wall , either built-in , or free-standing . More furniture is designed to be seen in the round , from all sides , since it can not be set against walls ( sec notes above , under Background ) . Furniture is smaller and lighter . Much of the newest furniture has a floating look contrived by separating upholstery as much as possible from its supporting wood framework , or by supporting case pieces on the thinnest possible metal legs . Hardware is either nonexistent , or exquisitely fashioned . All-purpose furniture does expansible tricks , or fits equally well into a number of rooms , a practical feature in today 's constant moving . Finishes are more varied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term , need not be synonymous with blond woods . And modern does n't necessarily mean metal .  | Materials . Modern fabrics are almost infinitely varied . They range from the finest silks to the newest man-made fibers like Orlon . Their designs range from the boldest , to no design at all , as in the case of a large mass of nubby textures . They are woven from a great combination of natural and man-made fibers , and they are printed in a variety of methods from hand silk-screening or hand block-printing , to machine printing in huge quantities . For information as to the specific properties of fabrics , consult the section elsewhere , " Know Your Textiles " ; manmade fabrics will be found under " Know Your Synthetics . " Today 's modern is becoming more and more a style which does n't try too hard . Its biggest advantage for you is just that . If you do n't care for exposed metal legs , do n't go in for them because they look modern . If you want to combine some of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a like scale and weight . A Queen Anne settee , subtly curving , for instance , would conceivably go with an equally refined modern Danish or Italian walnut piece , restrained and modulated . It would not look well with the machine school , or the Eames chair with metal legs . In other words , take your modern in small or large doses , but only if you have a real feeling for uncluttered living .  | WHEN you go out to shop for your hom before you leap . A knowledge of the market gives you a better pi on your problem because the most perfectly appointed house ml work . Your taste is only as informed as your experience is wide . freeze it into a pattern of labels . If foam rubber looks as though meet your requirements , buy it , but do n't buy it just because heard that " everyone is using it . " Do n't rush into colored fixtures in the bathroom simply because you 've read somewhere that that is the thing . Enlarge your knowledge as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a wide vicarious experience by reading everything you can get your hands on about the products are shopping . Have a conscious value pattern . Progress is not inevitable , and thing new on the market is not necessarily better than something o which you are familiar . Be informed about the old as well as th and choose from each according to the yardstick of values whip have set up . Do n't judge one age by another , or one product by a Silk is good because it is good for your purpose . So is Orlon . But C not necessarily better than silk . If you are informed about the prc of one or another , you will be well on your way toward making decision . You will find that there is a lot of name-calling in the market phrases as " Early American , " " Provincial , " and " Decorator Cola  | easily off the tongue . The obvious danger is the confusion caused by substituting the vague for the precise . How early is " Early American " ? Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he means pine and maple , and you are thinking , perhaps , of a Queen Anne walnut room ? Does Provincial mean Louis XV Provincial , or Louis XVI Provincial , or maybe Italian Provincial ? To compound confusion , some people call Early American " American Provincial . " And , as for " Decorator Colors , " are they pale or strong , subtle or vivid ? Obviously , they can be anything . If you clarify your thinking , and avoid generalities , you will find your shopping much easier . Another bugaboo is the great imponderable group called " they . " " They " are always using this or that product , or a certain palette ; or " they " are living this or that way . If you have set up your own personal yardstick of values , what " they " are doing has little interest for you , except an academic one of seeing how the other half lives . It 's your house , and it is going to reflect your personality . Read the newspapers and the magazines to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are excellent sources for that purpose . But remember that discrimination implies a standard of judgment , and you supply the standard , not the publications . If you are tempted to clip and file , use your scissors on informative material . Do n't swallow schemes and suggestions hook , line , and sinker , without pausing to relate them to your practical code . In window-shopping through the publications , do n't confuse decoration for function . When you buy with a knowing eye , you are thinking of use first , beauty second . The principles which apply to good cabinetwork very often also apply to good woodwork . To know standards of quality for good woodworking practice will help you select items for your home which are not only attractive and comfortable , but which are substantial and durable as well . Strangely enough , woodworking methods today have changed very little from those used for centuries by fine craftsmen . Plywoods and veneers are more commonly used now than before , but the traditional methods of joining have not yet been entirely superseded by new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly and reduce prices . In some cases steel frames are taking the place of wooden ones , plastics and aluminum may be used in chests of drawers , or new materials are found in chair construction ( sheet metal for the Knorr chair , for instance , molded plywood for the Eames-Saarinen , plastic , reinforced with glass fiber , for the Eames armchair ) , but glued wood joints remain standard practice in most cases . Your criteria should be : i . Will this furniture serve its purpose ? 2 . Does its appearance conform to basic standards of good taste ? Surface . When you shop for woodwork , begin from the outside in ; look at the surface first . Is it smooth and free from tool marks , uneven planing , raised grain , or scratches and dents ? If it is stained , is the stain uniform in color ? Are the hidden surfaces finished ? ( The best quality furniture has a light coat of finish on even the backs of chests and the bottoms of drawers . ) Are exposed ends banded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chipping ? Are moldings crisp and clean ? Are mitered profiles perfectly matched ? Joints . No woodwork or cabinetwork is any stronger than its joints . They must be smooth , perfectly matched , and above all , tight . Look for joints which have shrunk and have been patched with wood filler , or glue . Any gaps between joints are an obvious source of weakness . Look for precision and accuracy of fit . Look for nails ( there should n't be any ) . Poor workmanship in joinery is likely to be reflected in poor workmanship throughout any wood piece . There are a few traditional joints which , with variations , remain standard practice today : Plain Butt Joint . The simplest type of joint . It is obviously unsuited for much strain . Scarf Joint . A form of overlapping joint . Lap Joint . Equal halves are cut from each member , so that the joint is flush when they are placed together . Dado Joint . Used for supporting shelving or drawer bottoms in vertical pieces . Ideally a rabetted ( grooved ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right angles .  | Mortise and Tenon . One of the oldest joints used in construction , and one of the strongest . It may be pegged , or screwed for greater strength . A tenon should be one-third the thickness of the rail it terminates . Corner Joints . The simplest is rabetted ; the best is the lock joint . Dovetail Joints . These joints are an invariable sign of the best workmanship because : ( a ) they can only be made accurate with the best craftsmanship ; and , ( b ) because they resist separation in any direction . Glues . There is not much you can do about checking the glues used in a certain piece , but you can ask . Glues are used in woodwork and cabinetwork because they are stronger bonding agents than dowels , screws , or clamps . Glue spreads a uniform film that binds every part of the surface , and some glues are stronger than wood fibers themselves . Glues have different properties depending on their composition . Animal , or Hide Glue has the advantage of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however . Fish Glue dries slowly ( which may be an advantage , in some work ) . It is excellent for softwoods . It is not as strong as animal glue , and , like it , is not waterproof . Casein Glue is strong and quick drying . It is waterproof ( good for outdoor furniture , or a very damp climate ) , and heat resistant . ( The defect of deterioration under the action of salt water or mold has been partially corrected . ) Plastic Glue is waterproof and heat resistant . Glued furniture must be placed in clamps which usually exert a pressure of from one hundred to two hundred pounds of pressure per square inch . A minimum drying time is from four to seven hours . Twelve hours is better , with an additional twenty-four hours allowed for seasoning . Furniture construction is a logical process , primarily based on corrective measures to obviate inevitable shrinking and swelling in a whole piece of furniture . There are three methods of putting together any article of wooden furniture . Some pieces use only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carcass ) Construction uses only horizontal graining . Therefore ( theoretically ) all parts of a given construction of this type shrink equally . Stool Construction joins rails to legs with strong mortise and tenon joints . Frame Construction allows a panel to shrink independently of a nonshrinking framework . The above observations apply to straight wood . Plywood has largely obviated shrinking and swelling in large surfaces , and is commonly used for that reason , if no other . Drawers . Dovetail construction is always used in the best drawer construction . It should be used in front and back , for maximum strength . ( In less expensive pieces , the drawer back may be merely slipped into a groove . ) The bottom of a drawer , obviously , must be strong enough to support its contents , without sagging . It should be at least a quarter of an inch thick , and be blocked to prevent slipping . There are three types of drawer slides : ( r ) the center slide ; ( 2 ) the side slide ( a less costly method ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most expensive construction ) . Drawers should be tested to see whether they slide easily . They should fit snugly , but not so tightly as to bind with the slightest warping . They should , of course , be free from rattles , as much as free from jamming . The best construction uses well-seasoned wood ( warped wood indicates poor merchandise ) , and smoothly sanded parts . There should be dust panels between drawers ( you can see these if you pull the drawer out ) . Doors . Like drawers , doors must fit precisely , be unwarped , and be nonsticking . Cabinet and Table Tops . Tops should be attached with dowels , screws , or special metal clips . Glue , used alone , is affected by shrinking and swelling . Blocking . All larger pieces of wooden furniture should have their parts stiffened by proper blocking . To be of any value , blocks must he accurately fitted and secured . Legs . Look to see if curved legs are made all in one piece . Anything else destroys the strength of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in furniture construction may not be apparent  | Many pieces use hidden screws , countersunk , covered with a wooden plug ( for appearance 's sake , not to deceive the buyer ) . Screws , by the way , are not looked down upon by the modern cabinetmaker . Dowels . Dowels are pegs used as reinforcements of other joints . They are usually made from birch , beech , or hard maple , and range in diameter from one-eighth inch to one inch . Hardware . Cabinet hardware may be divided into two categories : hardware which is used in construction ( hinges , locks , casters , etc. ) ; and hardware which is decorative ( handles , mounts , and galleries ) . There are few rules for hardware , but what there are should be followed . Metal fittings can make or mar an otherwise well-made piece . Rule One : the simpler the piece , the plainer should be its hardware . Rule Two : hardware should be proportioned to the scale of the piece of furniture of which it is an integral part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make sure that the size is right and the style is right for the period involved . Metal mounts and hardware , used decoratively , reproduce the motifs popular in each period ( discussed in Part 4 ) . In general , eighteenth century hardware in England is made up of two brass parts ? a plate and the handle to which this is fastened . The early form of a handle was a plain ring , hanging from a circular disk . A loop handle hanging from a flat , shaped plate was an innovation of the eighteenth century , and as the period progressed the back plate was cut in a variety of patterns . On the continent , ornately molded ormolu handles were all of a piece . About the middle of the eighteenth century , two small oval or circular plates were substituted for a single back plate , and the scale of all hardware was diminished to accord with the lighter feeling prevalent in furniture designs . By the end of the eighteenth century , a continuous back plate was re-introduced , made of stamped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were discarded in favor of a vogue for knobs . Cut glass knobs were apparently an American nineteenth century innovation . Modern handles feature a greatly simplified , streamlined outline . But hardware is often non-existent , as in cases where moldings or concealed fingertip gouges are used as drawer pulls . Furniture Types . " Borax " furniture is a trade name used to describe a type of inexpensive furniture usually sold in suites to installment buyers . It is clumsy in design and execution , and should be avoided . No matter how tempting its price , it is not cheap in the end . Laminated furniture is wood furniture which has been electronically  | bonded and molded to shape on especially constructed presses . It is available in veneers , and with spring or rubber seats . An example would be the celebrated Eames chair . There are well over two hundred varieties of wood in commercial use in America , most of them from domestic sources . About two dozen , or thereabouts , are important enough for their names to be familiar to most people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best-known of the domestics ; and mahogany , rosewod , prima vera , and avodire are a few of the imports . The characteristics of wood differ very greatly among species , but it is also important to know that they vary among trees of the same species , and among pieces of wood from the same tree . No two pieces of wood are exactly alike . For fine furniture , a wood should be hard enough to resist denting , strong enough to provide rigidity without excessive weight , stable enough to assure that there shall be no warping or other distortions , and distinctive enough in natural pattern to be pleasing and beautiful . Labeling . You should know , at the outset , as a prospective furniture buyer , that there are perfectly definite rules ( set up by the Federal Trade Commission , in 1925 ) for describing wood furniture . They work to your advantage ; and you should be on the lookout for proper terms , whether in tags , advertising copy , or furniture catalogues . Remember two things : wood descriptions apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply to antique furniture . Labels specifically indicate whether a wood is solid , or a combination of solid and veneer . Furniture is labeled according to the species of wood or woods in the exposed surfaces . Veneers and plywoods are labeled as such . Woods stained to resemble a species popularly regarded as more valuable are labeled " walnut finish , " or " mahogany finish , " etc . This means that the designation relates to the finish or stain only , and the actual wood may be , say , red gum , birch , or maple , low-priced substitutes . Hardwood and Softwood . The terms " hardwood " and " softwood " as used in the lumber trades have nothing whatsoever to do with relative hardness or softness . They relate solely to the internal structure of  | woods , the hardwoods being those that have open-end cells or pores in addition to fibers . These pores conduct the sap through the tree . Most of the broad-leaf trees are hardwoods . The softwoods have no such pores and the sap is conducted by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad-leaf , the ginkgo , are softwoods . In actual physical characteristics yellow pine , as an example , which is a softwood , is much harder than yellow poplar , basswood or willow , all of which are hardwoods . Walnut . The finest domestic furniture wood is American black walnut . This does not mean that it is better for every purpose or in every instance , or that other fine woods are inferior . It does mean that selected stock has all the top requirements of a fine furniture wood . It is hard without being too hard , it has natural resistance to warping , shrinking and other faults , it glues well , and it has natural patterns in great variety , which are pleasing without being too spectacular . Walnut is generally a dark wood . Its color varies from light to a deep , rich , chocolate brown . It has a luster that gives the effect of depth , when finished . Oak . Another fine domestic furniture wood is oak . It is hard and strong and stable . It has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns that have kept it always in demand . The finer selections are known as white oak . There are about 6o different varieties of oak tree which furnish lumber for commercial use . Of these , about 14 are used in furniture . The lumber from eight of these is the white oak of the furniture trade . ( The color varies from an actual white to a grayish brown . ) Red oak , from about six other varieties of trees , has a reddish tinge and is somewhat more porous and not as strong . Although it is considered as inferior to white oak in quality it may be used frequently , with darker finishes , or in places where top quality is not needed . Maple . The sugar maple yields one of the important fine furniture woods . It is known as hard maple , or rock maple , to distinguish it from the lumber of the red maple , the silver maple , and the bigleaf maple , all of which produce the so-called soft maple of commerce . Hard maple ranks with black walnut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it has a fine , straight grain of no great distinction . Its color varies from white to a slightly reddish brown . It takes stain readily and finishes beautifully . The relatively rare quantities of maple with bird's-eye and curly and wavy figure are equal in beauty to any other figured wood . Straight-grained maple is used extensively in solid furniture of less than  | top-grade styling and price , but both the solid wood and the veneers are used in the finer grades of furniture . Birch . One of the most useful and versatile of furniture woods is birch . It comes from the yellow birch tree ( known also as the gray , silver , or swamp birch ) , and from the sweet birch ( which may be called cherry , black , or mahogany birch ) . It is a strong , hard wood of even texture , generally light in color , varying from a near white to a light brown and sometimes to a deeper , reddish brown . It can be stained to harmonize with any darker wood . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is abundant , reasonable in price , and especially adaptable for making plywood . Red Gum . The heartwood of the sweet gum is called red gum . It is somewhat softer and weaker than walnut or birch , and because of its color and grain is used in combination with walnut or mahogany . It is a dark reddish brown wood with irregular dark streaks which form a pleasing pattern . A number of other domestic woods which are not known primarily as fine furniture stock may be used either alone or in combination with other woods if they are properly selected and used with understanding . Sycamore . About the same hardness and strength as red gum , sycamore is one of these . It is a reddish brown wood , used in inner parts of furniture and available in plywood . Beech ? which is the equal of sugar maple in strength and hardness , but has more tendency to warp ? is a wood that bends well , making it useful for rockers and other curved parts . Elm and ash , both top-grade , extremely hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outer parts of high-grade furniture . Black cherry , a reddish brown wood of fine grain and a pleasing natural luster , was once widely used , especially for solid furniture , but it is relatively scarce today . Knotty Pine . Knotty pine , from the Idaho white pine , has been used recently in high-grade furniture . But , generally , the pines and evergreens , because of the presence of pitch , lack requisite hardness , and for other reasons are not considered to be good furniture woods . Mahogany . Just as walnut is conceded to be the finest of the domestic furniture woods , mahogany is the foremost of the imports . There are more than fifty kinds of trees that have been listed , at one time or another , as mahogany , but not more than half a dozen are included in  | those recognized as genuine ( " genuine , " by the way , is a term which means that all exposed solid parts and all veneers in a piece of furniture are of the wood named ) . " Philippine mahogany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows in the Philippines . Of the varieties of mahogany now accepted , West Indian mahogany , Honduras mahogany , and African mahogany constitute the finer furniture woods . These woods have all of the desirable requisites . They are hard and strong , they " work " well , they are stable , and they are available in a wide variety of patterns which finish beautifully . Their color varies ( depending on their finish ) , from blond ( which is nearly white ) through several shades of tan and reddish tan , to a deep , rich , reddish brown . Rosewood . Rosewood , like mahogany , includes a number of related and unrelated trees . The true rosewood of eastern Brazil is so called because of a somewhat roselike odor , which is strong in the fresh lumber , but faint in the cured wood . It is a very dark wood , brown , with a purplish tone , and with irregular , darker , almost black , streaks . It was once highly prized as a fine furniture wood , but it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardness as well as its high price . Satinwood . One of the best-known of the exotic furniture woods is satinwood . Used largely for inlay ( but available now in plywood ) it is golden blond in color with a design of fine broken stripes . Avodire . Another light-colored wood is avodire , resembling satinwood but with somewhat wider cloudy areas crossing its stripes . Prima Vera . At times called " white mahogany , " prima vera resembles true mahogany in grain and is strikingly blond in color . It is strong and hard and has been very popular in many finer pieces of modern design . Wood has been a favorite craftsmen 's material since the dawn of history . It is plentiful . It is easily made into useful shapes . It is strong , in proportion to its weight . It is pleasing in appearance , and " friendly " to the touch . As one expert explains , wood responds only slowly to changes of temperature , and therefore ( unlike metal and glass ) never feels either very hot or very cold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal , like to say that it is " alive , " that it has to be understood , that it responds like other living things to good treatment and resents abuse . They explain that wood is not a precise , inert material . No matter what the stabilizing  | processes , no matter how careful the fabrication , the finest of wood pieces will be sensitive to change and may absorb some water , for instance , when the humidity is high , and lose a little when it is low . This means that there is an imperceptible but certain swelling and shrinking ; the fibers take on a little moisture in the summer , when the weather is humid , and lose a little in the winter , when the indoor air is dryer . Well-built furniture , made from properly seasoned stock , will serve indefinitely , with reasonable care , but , like other living things , it is not indestructible . One of the first considerations in the preparation of a furniture wood is its seasoning , the drying of the wood to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . A tree holds water in its fibers . When the tree is cut , the water begins to evaporate . The fibers dry and shrink . If this drying is uncontrolled it may result in many kinds of trouble , such as checking or splitting , excessive warping , decay , and discoloration due to fungus . Lumber that is properly controlled during drying , whether air-dried or kiln-dried , is lumber that is stabilized so far as these ordinary ills are concerned , and is ready for use . Both air-drying and kiln-drying are used in seasoning furniture woods and the choice of method appears to make little or no difference . Modern kilns , however , can dry wood more thoroughly in a few days than can air-seasoning in several months ? an obvious advantage where time or storage space is a consideration . These defects are a combination of atmospheric conditions and the type of wood used . Warping is caused by the absorption of moisture : checking ( small cracks in wood surfaces ) is caused by excessive drying . Some woods , like mahogany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But all woods demand a reasonable amount of common-sense treatment in these respects . A steam-heated room can cause checking , especially in the case of antique furniture from abroad , which may never before have been subjected to such extremes in temperature . There is little that you can do about this , under ordinary circumstances . But a room humidifier will help , and such obvious preventatives as not placing a piece too near a radiator . In contemporary furniture , a good manufacturer uses parts which have a uniform moisture content . A new chemical treatment , devised to improve the usefulness of  | wood , controls warping , shrinking , and swelling . It also increases the density of soft woods . There are two methods of sawing which result in startling differences in the appearance of lumber ( as you see it ) . Plain-sawing makes parallel cuts from one side of the log right through to the other . Most of the planks will show what is called a straight-grain pattern . Annual rings make more or less parallel lines from one end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent or bulged , or somewhat larger at one end than at the other , the darker hue of the annual rings may form waves or contours or " U " curves where the saw cuts across them . But in the center planks of this log the darker lines of the annual rings will be much closer together , and there will be across-the-grain interruptions which may make the planks look as though they were cut from a different kind of wood . This  | is the edge-grain or quarter-grain . These planks are stronger , more expensive , and usually more beautiful than other planks . The reason for differences of grain lies in the fact that wood grows out from the center of a tree , adding an annual ring each year . The fibers ( and , in hard woods , the cells ) which form the visible grain run lengthwise . Radiating from the center , and crossing the annual rings , are a series of rays called medullary rays which distribute food material through the tree , horizontally . When the saw starts at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after plank it is cutting the ends off these rays , piece by piece , and they are not noticeable . But as the saw approaches the center , it begins to slice the rays at a slant until , finally , it is cutting them lengthwise , so that they appear as what they are : rays which pierce the annual rings from the center toward the bark . Not only is the pattern startlingly different ( and usually much more pleasing ) in these center planks , but the wood itself is stronger and more resistant to warping , checking , and other ills . Accordingly , lumbermen long ago developed a method of slicing called quarter-sawing which takes advantage of these facts and cuts the entire log for the maximum amount of edge-grain lumber . The theoretical ideal would be to saw a log into pie-shaped wedges and then square each piece , but the waste in such an idea is obvious . Practically , the same result is reached by taking out a pie-shaped one-fourth of the log in successive cuts with , of course , considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center . The log ( or half-log ) is then rotated a quarter turn and another series of parallel cuts is made . Although there is not too much waste , quarter-sawing is not as economical as plain-sawing , and the edge-grain plank is more expensive . Oak has unusually large rays , sometimes measuring four inches in height , resulting in unusually distinctive patterns when quartered . Walnut , maple , and red gum , mahogany and other tropical woods , and beech and sycamore show patterns of pleasing design . Birch reveals a very fine pattern which may seem monotonous if the grain is entirely straight , but when the grain is slightly wavy ( the trade calls it curly birch ) it presents a highly attractive appearance . Elm , ash , and cherry are not considered to be highly figured when quartered .  | Veneer is a thin sheet of wood glued or bonded to a base , under extreme pressure and heat . The grain of the veneer is at right angles to that of its base . Plywood consists of one or more layers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of veneer on each side of a center layer , or core . There is always an odd number of pieces of wood ? three , or five , or seven ? and each is at right angles to the next . Less expensive pieces of furniture use three plies ; quality furniture generally uses five plies ; shaped pieces may use seven , nine , or more . A grand piano may have as many as 17 . Usually , you will have to ask the salesman what he knows about the number of plies , since raw edges , in better furniture , are usually covered with crossbanding , and ca n't be visually checked by you . About 90 per cent of the strength of wood lies with the grain . When pull is applied the resistance along the grain may be as much as 300 times the resistance at right angles to the grain . Accordingly , plywood has a much greater average strength than solid wood and can be used in reduced thickness in many places in furniture . This means a reduction of weight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawer parts , and ordinary shelving , where normal stress is along the grain of the wood , there is no special structural reason for using plywood , and these parts may be made of solid wood . An exception might be noted when curves and irregular shapes are wanted , as in the case of some modern chairs or widely rounded , vertical surfaces . Plywood , molded or otherwise shaped for such special needs , may be much more satisfactory and easier to use than solid wood . Plywood construction , with its layers arranged across the grain of the adjacent layer , or layers , not only strengthens the wood in the direction of its greatest weakness , but also evens the stresses caused by changes of temperature and moisture . There is less shrinking and swelling , less tendency to warp , and less likelihood of checking , or developing cracks . Against these structural advantages of plywood , for furniture surfaces and for paneling , solid lumber presents no great advantages , unless a surface is to be carved , or unless it is exposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on solid wood ) . A preference for solid mahogany , or solid oak , for instance , over good veneers is more likely to be a matter of personal whim than the result of analytical judgment . Even solid table tops , in these days , are likely to be compositions of relatively narrow planks , doweled and splined together , because this produces  | a more stable , and ( if the pieces are matched as to grain ) a more pleasing surface than a one-piece top . Solid wood means that all the exposed woods used are of the solid wood named . Hidden parts ( such as drawer interiors , and backs of case pieces ) are not expected to be made of the same expensive wood as the rest of the piece . In addition , some woods , like satinwood , are never used solid , because they do n't hold up in large areas . Above all , plywood , today , is responsible for a choice of woods and wood patterns that is literally limitless . A veneer , in a plain-sawed finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern , without regard for the differences in strength and resistance to warping that would come to mind in choosing the solid wood . People of limited income are able to choose from dozens of woods and hundreds of different grains and combinations . Beautiful figures may be placed where they show to the best advantage . In addition to the plain-grain and edge-grain of standard regular lumber , the veneer makers use several other cuts to get different effects . The most important of these is the rotary cut which slices the wood off the circumference of a rotating log in a continuous peel . It yields sheets of far greater size than is possible in regular lumber . The pattern of a rotary-cut veneer is intermediate between plain-sawed and quarter-sawed . Veneering is not a cheap process , and you should not think of it as an inferior substitute for something finer . The best veneering is costly . For that reason , there is no advantage to using it indiscriminately , for simple designs , or when utilizing simply grained woods ( such as cherry , pine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for small pieces of furniture , such as chairs . The core and internal layers of plywood are seldom of the same wood as its surfaces . Surfaces are often of the same kind of wood , front and back , so that stress , moisture changes , etc. , are equalized , but the back , if not exposed , is likely to be inferior in figure . Yellow poplar and basswood , both of which are somewhat soft and otherwise unsuited to furniture surfaces , are superior for plywood cores , largely because of their light weight and good gluing qualities . Red gum and tupelo are also used for cores . The pattern formed by the fibers of wood , annual rings , rays , and light and dark pigmentation is called the " figure . " Differences the figure of plain-sawed , quarter-sawed , and rotary-cut ( veneer ) wood have
