Ernie Kovacs , 38 , is the one television comedian who finds most of his tee-hee in TV itself . He is a big ( 6 ft. 2 in. , 200 Ibs. ) , messy , cigar-frazzling buffoon who uses cameras , sets , sound effects to make rowdy electronic fun . He may duel and play poker with himself or shoot a hole through his head and blow smoke through it . Once he appeared to viewers inside a huge bottle , holding an umbrella to keep off the rain . He was slowly submerged , then he tapped the bottle with a hammer ; and glass , water and Kovacs spilled onstage . Curling his lip over his mustache in a saucy moue , he may address himself to a golf ball and wham it squarely into the Cyclops eye of the camera . After a splintering crash , viewers duck , the screen goes dark , a voice purrs : " And let that teach all of you out there to pay attention . " <P> A onetime $18-a-week Trenton , N.J. disk jockey and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of utility infielder for all three networks . He is not a refugee from other places , but that rare being , a home-grown product of TV-and one of the few fresh and lasting performers in the business . Yet his cultivated madness , often abetted by his wife , Singer Edie Adams , has been delighting and annoying audiences only irregularly and at odd hours since he first leered onscreen seven years ago . Neither Kovacs nor his employer , NBC , seems able to explain why there is still no niche for his comparatively languid , low-pressure ' talent in a business that constantly turns lesser comics into living-room idols . In a new effort to solve this puzzle , NBC last week handed Ernie his big challenge : a show following the widely ballyhooed Jerry Lewis solo . <P> Kovacs won the comparison test , hands down . He put together a half-hour quite different from his usual garrulous routines and his role as sometime host on NBC 's Tonight . Instead , Producer-Writer Kovacs buttoned his lip tight and proved himself TV 's most inventive master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he opened a copy of Camille , a female cough came out of it . He educed a knowing chuckle from the inscrutable Mona Lisa , and screwed up his rubbery face with Chaplinesque glee as Baby Doll rolled out of her famed crib . As Eugene the Clubman he was defied by gravity . The Nairobi Trio , composed of three derbied apes , played a hilarious composition for xylophone , mallet and finger bone . There was even a custard pie . <P> The show was , strangely enough , Kovacs ' first chance at high season to show his stuff and his pulling power on NBC at a prime time . Program Chief Tom McAvity called it Ernie 's " audition , " explained : " If his rating is good , we hope to sell him as TV 's big new comedy talent next fall . "
