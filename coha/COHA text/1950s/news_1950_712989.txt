txt Secretary of the Treasury Snyder , commenting on the current business scene , finds evidence on every hand , he says , that " an era of dynamic progress is under way . " The present advance , he observes , " is a soundly financed movement , deriving its basic strength from a broad and expanding consumer demand . " There is no doubt that since the setback of 1918-49 , usually referred to as the " inventory readjustment , " the economy has shown a very vigorous recovery . The recession of that period carried the Federal Reserve Board 's index of industrial production from a high of 195 , reached in the late fall of 1948 to a low of 161 in July . 1949 . By April of this year , however , that index had recovered to 189 , and preliminary estimates place it slightly higher than this for May . The May figures show that unemployment has fallen from its high of 4.684,000 in February to 3,057,000 , the lowest total since April of last year . Average weekly wages in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total compensation of employes , while corporate profits were reported as running at an annual rate of 318 billions , up a billion for 1949 . All these things add up to a picture , as Secretary Snyder says , of " dynamic progress "  - -  or at least dynamic activity . He is probably correct , too , when he says that there is nothing in the immediate situation to suggest that a downturn is imminent . He is on a good deal more insecure terrain , however , when he say. : the advance rests on " a broad and expanding consumer demand . " In an excited business expansion of this kind the foundation structure is rarely without flaws , and we are certainly not going to progress very far in the direction of eliminating " booms and busts " by pretending , in this or any other case , that such flaws do not exist , The truth is that there are strong spots and weak spots in the present business picture and that the strong ones are getting stronger , the weak ones weaker . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as between durable and non-durable goods . While the index of durable goods output rose between January and April from 209 to 221 , that for nondurables showed no net change at all for the same four rionths . A strictly durable goods recovery is apt to be a volatile and unpredictable one , because it is likely to be a recovery based predominantly on credit expansion . That is definitely true in the present case , in which the principal driving forces have been supplied by residential building and automobile buying . Put another way , these forces have come from a vast expansion of consumer credit , on the one hand , and urban mortgage credit , on the other . Figures on consumer credit outstanding , just released by the Federal Reserve Board , show it standing at S18.6 billions , compared with $15.6 billions a year ago and with $13 billions at the beginning of 1948 . Urban mortgage debt has doubled since the end of the ? var , and a record net increase of $7.5 billions is already predicted for the year 1950 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its stockpiling of materials and its price support programs have played a major part in stimulating business recovery , and they are hardly to be regarded as the kind of influences that make a solid foundation for recovery . If we needed any evidence on this point it is currently being provided by new and definite signs of inflation in real estate and in - basic commodities . Steel scrap , " ceilinged " at $20 a ton during the war , shot up this week to $46 a tori , an alltime high , while almost equally sensational advances have been recorded recently in other metals and in such staples as rubber and wool . These less pleasant aspects of the present post-war revival do not , needless to say , sustain the conclusion that the country is moving toward the edge of a business precipice . They do indicate clearly , on the other hand , that it rests upon a composite of elements , some o. which are undoubtedly sound , but too many of which do not by any stretch of definition belong in that category .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
