The Mixture As Before <P> Jerome Herman ( " Dizzy " ) Dean , onetime fogball pitcher for the St. Louis Cardinals , beginning his new job as a TV newscaster for the New York Yankees , said that he would go right on talking " same as I do back in Arkansas . " What about listeners in Brooklyn ? " If they cai n't understand me , we 're even . I cai n't understand them , either . " <P> Playwright-Biographer Robert Emmet ( Roosevelt and Hopkins ) Sherwood told the New York Times Magazine how he had found , among the newly opened archives of his old friend Franklin Delano Roosevelt , some unpublished correspondence between F.D.R. and the late William Allen White , philosopher-publisher of Emporia , Kans . One of the letters , which had contained a snapshot of F.D.R. in one of his favorite seersucker suits , began " Dear Bill : Here is the seersucker picture , duly inscribed by the sucker to the seer . " <P> Columnist Westbrook Pegler predicted that the present literary scene " might fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of garbage . " Anyway , said Pegler , who used to be a good reporter himself , and careful of his facts , " fiction is a cowardly medium . The fictioneer need n't defend his position or accept the responsibility for the harm he does . . . " <P> <P> All in the Family <P> Boxer-turned-Painter William Grant Sherry , 35 , who last fall managed to patch up a loudly publicized spat with his cinemactress wife Bette Davis , 42&gt; was in trouble again . Sherry had noisily broken up a party at the RKO studio , where the cast of The Story of a Divorce had just presented Actress Davis with a monstrous trophy for being " a good egg " ( see cut ) . When he heard that his didoes had prompted highstrung Bette to resume divorce proceedings , the ex-pug unburdened himself to the press : " I 'm tired of being pushed around . She was the breadwinner , and I was the housewife and I 've loved doing it . All I asked in return was love and affection ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got home . I 'd take off her shoes and bring her her slippers and fix her a drink . I pressed her dresses when her maid was n't here . I 'd draw her bath and give her massages . I felt it was a privilege to do things for her . She 'd say , ' Well , what do you want ? You 're adequately fed and clothed . ' I did n't want money . I wanted love , but she has n't time for a husband when she works . " After thinking it over for a day or two , Sherry added hopefully : " My wife is a troubled , mixed-up girl . She has never been really happy . . . If she would join me in consulting my psychiatrist , I am positive our marital problems could be worked out . "
