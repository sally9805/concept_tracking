txt Argentine President Arturo Frondizi , a man in the eye of a political-economic hurricane . arrives in the U.S. today seeking new support to meet the storms ahead . Mr. Frondizi. who survived one attempt to overthrow him in mid-November . is expected to face stiff new threats to his young regime in the next three to eight months . His expected foes : Organized labor , followers of exiled former dictator Juan Domingo Peron and Communists . Their chief weapon : Public resentment of the president 's drastic In-fen= remedies , which include meatless days . higher transport fares and a ban on future wage boosts . To help meet the threat . Mr. , Frondizi will be searching for both Government and private aid in his 12-day U.S. visit . He is expected to try to line up new investments from meat packers , U.S. manufacturers and New York banks during his 12. day stay in this country . The Argentine president lands today in Charleston . S. C .. and comes to Washington on President ? Eisenhower 's personal plane Tuesday . He leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit Chicago , Detroit . New York City and Miami before leaving for home February 1 . He is clearly bidding for greater Government economic and political support simply by flattering the U.S. with the official visit . Evidence of Friendship For while the invitation to Mr. Frondizi was a means of showing Uncle Sam 's pleasure with his administration , the Eisenhower Administration can point to his visit as evidence of the newly-friendly- ties between the U.S. and Argentina-the first solid gains for the new U.S. policy toward Latin America . If Frondizi can hold on for the next year , he should be able to stick for good . " an Amer-lean diplomat says in summing up the prevailing opinion here . " Yes , we should pass the crisis in the next eight or nine months , " agrees Argentina 's tmder secretary of economy . Mario Mendevil. currently in this country . " The first three months will be difficult and the next five or six a lesser problem . " Looking farther ahead . international economists here forecast five or ten years of economic touch-and-go for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing the predictions of dangerous times ahead is Argentina 's economic situation and the prescribed Frondizi cure . In a nut-shell . Argentina has been buying more than she has been selling and now has run out of savings to pay the difference . The new president has proclaimed an austerity program designed to cut back spending and increase income from exports .. More than a few skeptics doubt he will succeed . The trouble started after World War IL Argentina had built up substantial foreign exchange reserves by selling her meat . grain . wool and other goods at high prices abroad . But instead of husbanding the reserves . Argentines spent lavishly on imports they could n't buy during the war . Dictator Peron started nationalizing a number of foreign-owned industries . notably the British-owned railways . for which he spent a huge portion of accumulated sterling . And , with the exception of the Korean War years , the prices for Argentine exports slumped , dropping income under spending . The $653 million in gold and dollar reserves that Argentina had at the end of 1950 dwindled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last December . They 've decapitatized their economy , " sums up a U.S. diplomat " They 've been liv . ing on capital for the last 10 years and now it is n't producing enough income . " This was the situation facing Mr. Frondizi when he took Office last May as the first freelyelected Argentine president in B ) years . He succeeded the provisional military government headed by Gen. Pedro E. Aramburu which ousted dictator Peron in September , 1955 . Despite initial misgivings , the U. S. Government has been highly pleased at . the way Mr. Frondizi has moved . He has split with Peronist labor elements who backed him in the election . He also opened up Argentina 's oil fields to investment by foreign oil companies through a group ' of contracts under which the companies will technically produce oil for the government oil monopoly . Y.P.F. Most dramatically . Mr. S'rontlizi imposed an austerity program on Argentina December 29 , backed up by $329 million of credits-5200. million from , , Uncle Sam , Pe million from 11 private U.S. banks and $75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club Imports Argentina moved to curb imports by letting the peso seek its own level in the free exchange market , now about 65 to Si . Previously . the government had subsidized imports of some goods by allowing buyers to get the needed foreign currency at the rate of 18 pesos for $1 or some other artificial rate . In addition , the government has now imposed surcharges of 20% to 300% on imports of most goods . Free of this extra import tax are 21 items such as oll , coal , newsprint and rubber . Industrial and construction materials fill up the 20% and 40% lists while most con. sumer goods except witches carry a 300% surcharge , practically banning import of many of these goods . It 's still too early to tell the results of these actions . trade experts here say . But they note that the peso has stayed relatively stable near the 65 to $1 rate since Argentina reopened its currency exchange market last Tuesday . This indicates some sort of stability . The big petroleum production program also airns.at cutting Argentina 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $300 million of oil from abroad each year , as now . But this program will require two or three years at least to achieve its goal . according to Mr. Mendevil . Mr. Frondizi 's attempt to boost Argentine exports appears an even tougher job to U.S. ' aides . Argentina plans to increase its meat exports by reducing home consumption . The tactics : Higher prices and meatless Mondays and Fridays . The government hopes , too , that livestock men will rebuild the herds they a ! - lowed to dwindle in past years . The new exchange rates also are aimed at spurring export sales of wheat and wool . But trade authorities here doubt any dramatic Increase will develop because world markets are already glutted for these goods . ' The trouble is that Argentina just does n't lawn to have anything that somebody else does n't have a lot of , too , ' suns up a 1.7- S. authority . Frondizi 's Political Troubles As foreboding as these long-rum economic facts appear , the immediate political consequences of Mr. Frondizi 's economic bravado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labor is expected to seek his ouster when workers begin to feel austerity 's pinch . Officials predict explosions over such developments as these : Gasoline has been tripled in price to six pesos a liter ( about a quart . ) Travelers are having to pay more-a doubling in Buenos Aires subway fares . a 60% Um in rail fares-in an attemt to put moneylosing government utilities nearer a paying basis . AM rail rates will have to be boosted even more to achieve the goal , U.S. experts figure . Electricity users now have to pay 50% more in another assault on the estimated $170 million or more a year drain on the government treasury by state-owned enterprises . Many of Argentina 's many government workers are to be laid off . Labor has already proclaimed its distaste for these austerity measures . Why then the predictimat of a three-months delay before the assault on Mr. Frondizi ? Part of the reason is apparently excellent timing by Mr. Frandizi , a canny . practical politician . The austerity program was started during the holiday season when most workers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer in Argentina and the needs for fuel , electricity and heavy foods are n't as great as they will be later . Many workers are on vacation . Another advantage is that Mr. Frondizi has left himself some room for maneuver . He has promised labor one more round of wage increases before a long-term freeze. - Smart timing of the wage hike could conceivably drain off revolutionary sentiment In any event . Mr. Frondizi seems to have his opposition stymied at the moment . The army and practically all of congress is behind him . By turning back Peronist labor demands in November 's oil field strike , he won more conservative support . And labor is still split between pro and anti.Perohists , experts here report .
