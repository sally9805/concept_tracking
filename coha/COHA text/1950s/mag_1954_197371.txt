Solemnly holding a copy of the only Bible ever approved by an American Congress , * dapper , dark-haired Lawrence Quincy Mumford , 50 , last week swore to perform faithfully one of the most arduous bookkeeping jobs the world has to offer . As the new Librarian of Congress ( appointed last April by President Eisenhower ) , Mumford will preside over the world 's largest storehouse of the written word-31,692,000 pieces , including 9,000,000 books , 13 million manuscripts and 412,000 records . <P> An energetic , reserved North Carolinian who put in 16 years at the New York Public Library , four more as head of Cleveland 's library system , Mumford is the fourth professionally trained librarian to get the profession 's top job-and the scrambled heritage that goes with it . Established by Congress in 1800 , the library could at first muster only 1,000 volumes , tucked away for congressional reference in a room of the old Capitol . Even this meager collection was virtually wiped out when the British put Washington to the torch during the War of 1812 . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1814 kept the idea of a national library from expiring ; even so , successive Congresses were reluctant to increase the annual budget . By 1853 , occupying its own rooms ( now offices ) in the Capitol , the library contained but 35,000 volumes , no match for the great state collections of France and Britain . As U.S. publishing expanded after the Civil War , so did the library 's literary holdings , but not until 1886 did Congress provide any substantial amount of funds to build the vast-domed , granite library building ( completed in 1899 ) east of the Capitol . <P> Today , despite the addition of a $10 million annex , the library is hard put to preserve , store and display its growing hoard . For lack of personnel , books from its stacks can not be issued after 6 p.m . Its 2,300,000 maps need far more space . For lack of funds , its collection of 2,234,000 photos and slides is kept filed away instead of being exhibited throughout the country . Despite President Eisenhower 's request for more funds , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Librarian Mumford take care of the nation 's cramped study . <P> <P> *The Aitken Bible , first English-language Bible to be printed in America , published in Philadelphia in 1782 , endorsed by the Continental Congress .
