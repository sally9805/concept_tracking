Not since 1640 , when extracts of " Jesuits ' bark " ( cinchona ) from Peru first gave Europeans the benefits of quinine for their " ague , " has there been such good news for the world 's malaria victims , who number hundreds of millions . Doctors can now handle a feverish flare-up caused by practically any type of malaria , and they can prevent relapses in most types . More progress has been made in the last dozen years than in the last three centuries . Last week the A.M.A. Journal published up-to-date reports on some of the latest drugs , based on the experience of G.I.s returned from Korea . <P> Malaria is not a single , simple disease , but a complex of diseases caused by several kinds of tiny protozoan parasites . In their complicated life cycle , after being transferred from an infected mosquito to a human host , they spend part of their time in the blood cells and part in the tissues . <P> Falciparum malaria , untreated , is more likely to be fatal than other forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissues only once , can be knocked out with the old standby , quinine , or wartime atabrine , or postwar Paludrine , Camoquin and chloroquine . The same drugs have done a good job of suppressing the fever flare-ups of relapsing ( " vivax " ) malaria , which occur when the parasites are in the blood . <P> One-Shot Cure ? The big task has been to find a drug which would not only suppress active malaria , but cure the disease by destroying the parasites during the periods when they hide in the body tissues , so that there can be no more relapses . And it should be something that can be taken once , or for a short time , and then forgotten . The Army medics knew that in the G.I.s returning from Korea for discharge they had a perfect test sample of men who would forget about " malaria discipline " as soon as they got home . <P> While they were in the lines and exposed to Korea 's vivax-carrying mosquitoes , the troops got chloroquine ( after the first few , disorganized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it regularly . Even though they were bitten , the men had few feverish attacks . But they still had malaria . When they started home , the medics went to work on them aboard troop-laden transports . This time their weapon was primaquine , developed in the laboratories of Columbia University . These returned soldiers are being checked for relapses . There have been few , according to reports available now ( but still incomplete ) . <P> Along with this mass test , the Army doctors got a chance to work on the soldiers who had gone to Korea first and come home earlier , without primaquine treatment . Last summer they began to show up at station hospitals all over the U.S. for malaria treatment . Some got only chloroquine , and nearly one-third soon had a second relapse . But of 246 who got pamaquine as well as chloroquine , only one relapsed , and of 231 who got primaquine with chloroquine , none relapsed . <P> Danger on the Side . Primaquine has one peculiarity : it is much safer for white patients than others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anemia after relatively small doses . Also , it has to be given in several doses , so it is not the ideal drug for such a vast area of relapsing malaria as India .
