In most Western European nations these days , no party commands an absolute majority , and most must rule by coalition . The net effect of coalitions is usually to dull debates , to narrow ambitions and to blunt the cutting edge of bold politics . Rivalries that would otherwise be threshed out in the open , are fought out instead inside Cabinet meetings . Cabinets fall unexpectedly and new ones must be formed . Examples of these processes at work last week : <P> Finland . A coalition of five non-Communist parties-the 19th government since World War II-was forced out by internal bickering and pressure from outside . Finland 's big neighbor , the Soviet Union , recalled its ambassador , and played hard-to-get in trade talks with the Finns in a bald attempt to force a less conservative regime . The Communists , who hold 50 seats in a 200-seat Parliament , now hold something of a balance of power among the squabbling nonCommunists . <P> The Netherlands . Premier Willem Drees and his Labor Party ( Socialists ) , who hold 50 out of 150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher taxes for two more years . The Catholic People 's Party ( 49 seats ) partner of the Socialists for twelve years , wanted a one-year extension . Down went Drees . <P> Iceland . The leftist coalition fell apart on methods to halt the rising cost of living and to solve a wage dispute in the important fishing industry ( the Minister of Fisheries and Trade is a Communist , and most of the fish is sold to Russia ) . Non-Communist Premier Hermann Jonasson wanted a one-month wage-and-price freeze ; the Communist-led Labor Alliance objected , and the dispute has left Iceland with no government for two weeks . <P> Italy . Left-of-Center Christian Democratic Premier Amintore Fanfani was the victim of an old Italian parliamentary game he used to be very familiar with . He lost two votes on minor issues because right-wing members of his own party voted in secret against him . He called for an open vote of confidence , won it by eight votes . At the first opportunity to vote in secret again-a bill on wholesale food regulations-he lost again last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but his authority is severely weakened . One day he falls .
