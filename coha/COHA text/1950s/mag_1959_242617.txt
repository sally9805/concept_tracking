From : Adjutant General , U.S. Army <P> To : Continental Army Headquarters <P> Subject : Patron Saints <P> Because of the religious connotations of projects designating St. Barbara as patron saint of artillery and St. Maurice as patron saint of infantry , addressees are directed to ensure a thorough understanding by subordinate commanders . . . that activities of this type or of a related nature will be limited to unofficial and voluntary participation by those interested . <P> Behind the well-starched prose of this memo , sent out last week by the U.S. Army 's Adjutant General Robert Lee , lay the sleepless vigilance of the organization known for short as P.O.A.U. , and for long as Protestants and Other Americans United for Separation of Church and State . P.O.A.U. has been increasingly uneasy about what it views as an excessive growth of Roman Catholic influence in the armed forces ( and elsewhere ) , specifically in the promotion of chaplains . But P.O.A.U. 's uneasiness mounted to anxiety when it caught wind of what seemed to its officials a movement to dedicate the U.S. Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maurice . First indication of the trend , according to Dr. C. Stanley Lowell , managing editor of the P.O.A.U. monthly , Church and State , was a drive last spring by the Catholic Holy Name Society at infantry-minded Fort Benning , Ga . to promote St. Maurice as patron saint of the infantry. * A program was drawn up . calling for erection at Benning of a $2,300 statue of the saint , the printing of 30,000 folders on his life , wide distribution of St. Maurice medals and the presentation of St. Maurice scrolls to Fort Benning visitors . <P> Next came news from Fort Leonard Wood , Mo . that Colonel Franklin R. Sibert , commander of the 2nd Training Regiment and an Episcopalian , had lent his personal weight to a St. Maurice campaign . A large painting of the saint was hung at headquarters , drawings of St. Maurice were displayed throughout the post , the officers ' club was named St. Maurice Club , the gym was named after him , and wooden scrolls appeared on the barracks walls bearing the inscription : " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Maurice . " <P> St. Barbara 's Own . Protests to the Defense Department from P.O.A.U. and various Protestant chaplains resulted in toning down the St. Maurice movement at both posts , plus last week 's directive from the Adjutant General . But P.O.A.U. is still casting an uneasy eye around the armed services . The organization is currently checking into the possibility of undue Catholic pressure in the naming of the I Corps Artillery 's post in Korea four years ago as Camp St. Barbara and the report that artillerymen there are calling themselves " St. Barbara 's Own . " * " This thing seems to be spreading almost like ' Kilroy was here , ' " said P.O.A.U. 's Lowell this week , and then dropped an artilleryman 's salvo into the camp of Senator John Kennedy . " If we had a Catholic President , would we have this kind of thing rubbed in our faces all the time ? " <P> <P> * St. Maurice was a senior officer of an all-Christian unit of a Roman army in the 3rd century . Ordered to sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and St. Maurice and his men were killed .
