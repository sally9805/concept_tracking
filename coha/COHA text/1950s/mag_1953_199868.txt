Misalliance ( by George Bernard Shaw ) has long had a reputation for being virtually unplayable . Very likely this rumor got around because for years few people ever saw it played . Performed on Broadway last week for the first time since 1917 , it pranced and hallooed and came hilariously to life , giving further reason for saluting Shaw 's ghost with : " This was the noblest showman of them all .

If family life has seldom been so discredited , it has seldom possessed such genuine if turbulent charm . Misalliance has , to be sure , its limitations . It could stand cutting ; and though its method conquers the audience , in the end it defeats itself . The play can mean so many things that it really means nothing at all . <P> The current production is so alive largely because Director Cyril Ritchard makes no effort to give it meaning , but plays it entirely for farce .
