p I The Living Rock A Story by Elizabeth Sewell Drawings by Kurt W erth H is mother passed him in the passage , carrying a bowl of salad . The way from the kitchen to the living-room was little more than a collection of dark corners ; but this evening all the light there was fell upon what she held in her hands , the big bowl piled high with lettuce leaves , uncut , the youngest on the top , still wet from the tap and shining as if they had been lacquered , with here and there a ruby tomato glowing in its glassy setting . Paul noticed the thing , so much more brightly colored than his mother who seemed thinner and browner than ever behind it ; but he turned away and became very busy taking off his satchel and hanging his coat up , thus avoiding his mother 's eye . " Hurry up , Paul , " she said as she went past , and he walked through the kitchen to the scullery sink where young Godfrey , who had supposedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towel behind the door . " You 'll catch it , " Paul said , pulling up the sleeves of his gray pullover and scrubbing face and arms up to the elbow with the hard yellow soap . Godfrey ignored the implications of this remark and at once burst into conversation , to show that he had other and more important things to think about . " I say , Paul , they 've started digging up that bit of the street where the gas main went wrong , and they 've got a big drill there . I asked the man on the way back from school to let me help work it , but he said no . " Paul made friendly noises from inside the roller towel , where he had found a spot that was clear of Godfrey 's traces . He was not wanting to talk himself but he knew that his brother liked to report on the happenings of the day , or , more properly , of the afternoon , for by the evening the events of the morning had receded into dimness for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a running commentary upon somebody 's prowess with a new football , did his own hair and gave a nominal scuff or two to Godfrey 's thick mat , calling forth an occasional " Ow ! " , equally nominal , from the head beneath it but in no way interrupting the flow of words . They began to move in the direction of tea , Paul pulling his sleeves down as he went , Godfrey rummaging in his pockets . " I 've got something for you , " he said , trying to get his fingers right to the bottom of the pocket and of the collection of oddments there . " It 's rather small , " he added , glancing up hopefully at his brother . " Dennis gave it me as a swop for my cigarette cards , the motor-car ones . " " Is it something for the drawer upstairs ? " The small face beamed with huge approval at Paul 's acumen and at having produced something so welcome . Indeed at this point , just before they left the kitchen for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the left pocket of Godfrey 's shorts , and was dropped like a small shell or a sweet into Paul 's open palm . I i4 T 's something that belonged to his mother , but he found it in an old green case inside their blanket chest and she let him have it . She said it had fallen out of an old ring and nobody wanted it . " Paul looked at it . " It 's a tiny intaglio , " he said with pride , his former heaviness forgotten for a moment . " It 's lovely . " " What 's a what-you-said ? " " Ca n't you see ? " He held the tiny object up to the light that came through the glasspanels of the back door . The thing glowed orange-red suddenly , and , incised on it , lighter than the surrounding stone , could be seen the figure of a man , with arms and legs pointing , dancing perhaps or flying . " It 's a stone with a man in it , " Godfrey said triumphantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for his brother had dropped the stone so suddenly that it might have burned him . It was Godfrey who found it , against the doormat . " Keep it for me , " Paul said , making no move to take it as it lay in the small hand . " I 'll look at it properly when I come up-stairs . " " Will you be early tonight ? " Godfrey asked , a slight note of entreaty in his voice , " or will you have to go to Dad 's meeting ? " " I do n't know . " Paul was halfway down the corridor by this time . His back discouraged further remarks . Godfrey trotted after him . In the living-room they found their father seated already at the tea table , reading something like a newspaper only smaller . It was headed Gospel Tidings and was in very black print on shiny paper . It always arrived on alternate Thursdays , and Dad read it over his tea before the " meeting . " It was as sure a sign of fortnights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front room on those same alternate Thursday evenings and , later , the arrival of the seven or eight men , mostly about Dad 's own age , who came to the prayer meeting , arriving regularly at eight o'clock . Mother by that time would have cleared away and washed up and be hidden in the kitchen with her basket of mending ; she would have felt it in some way improper in herself to be present . Godfrey would be in bed in the big room upstairs , above the parlor , which the two boys shared . Paul might be doing homework on the kitchen table , or gardening ; but on the last three occasions he had been asked by his father to join the meeting . He had taken it as a sign that his father recognized he was growing up and he had gone unconcernedly , if without great enthusiasm . He had been made welcome , according to prayer-meeting conventions . Everyone had shaken hands with him while they were standing about waiting for things to begin . Mr. Torton , the undertaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand a little longer than the others and had said how they rejoiced in the Lord to see a new face , and a young one too , " and perhaps our young friend will give us our Bible reading . " Paul had found his father 's Bible , its stiff black cover greasy with use , put into his hands . The outside of the book was as familiar to him as the inside was . His eyes wandered round the circle of heavy faces to see if they could give him an idea of what to read , but all he noticed was the rather weedy youth from the tobacconist 's near the Corn Exchange , who was sitting looking so solemn and stuffed that Paul suddenly wanted to laugh . For lack of inspiration his mind reverted to its own abiding passion . Shall it be Genesis 2 , he thought , turning over the leaves and picking out the verses he had in mind : " The whole land of Havilah . . . there is bdellium and the onyx stone . " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( What was bdellium anyway ? Not that it mattered -- a lovely name . ) Instead , he switched to the other end of the book , announced Revelations 21:19 , and read to the end of the chapter . His hearers sat with large hands resting on decent dark trousers , seeing themselves miraculously transported out of the ordinariness of their daily lives in that little town into the shining streets of the New Jerusalem . But the reader was lost in what almost amounted to a catalogue of the objects of his passion . They could have the glory within the gates ; he could not go beyond the particulars of thisloveliness : " All manner of precious stones ... jasper . . . sapphire . . . chalcedony . . . emerald ... sardonyx . . . sardius . . . chrysolyte . . . beryl . . . topaz . . . chrysoprasus .. . jacinth . . . amethyst . " After that came pearls and gold and glass , and then there were a few verses in which to recover from all that beauty , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulated him upon his reading and his father too , though Paul , looking at his father 's face , saw plainly there that mistrust he always had for what he considered his son 's inexplicable fancy for learning and reading and thinking about precious stones , or stones in general . He could not , however , say anything now . T ON IGHT there would be more Bible reading , more prayers , maybe a hymn or two . Paul 's heart moved unevenly . He saw what was coming . His father was laying down the Gospel sheet and getting to his feet . He looked at his wife fitting the crocheted tea-cosy on to the teapot till only the brown spout and handle stuck out of the orange wool , making it look ridiculously like a small very fat brown dog done up in a coat against the cold . He looked at his two sons , Godfrey surveying the plate of bread and butter , and the long thin Paul leaning forward with his hands on the back of his chair . " Say grace for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul , " Godfrey muttered and giggled , to be reproved by a look from his mother . Silence fell . Heads were bowed . Then Paul spoke . " I ca n't , Dad . " A car went past the house . The dish of tinned pears waited . One of Godfrey 's shoes squeaked . Three faces looked at the family dissenter . The father broke the silence . " What is the matter , son ? Ca n't you ask God to bless our meal for us ? " " I do n't believe in God any more . " Mrs. Crundall 's hand moved to her mouth . The company round the table suddenly fell apart , the women and children , alarmed , effacing themselves and leaving the floor to the two men of the family who faced one another across the teacups and the tablecloth . " Are you having a joke with rne , Paul ? " " No , Dad . " " And when , may I ask , does this unbelief date from ? " " From this afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul had merely wanted to state the facts without concealment , but his answer seemed to be unfortunate . Mr. Crundall went very red , and Godfrey began to struggle with tears . " Say grace , Godfrey , " his father said . Godfrey gave a great swallow , said with a rush , " Bless o Lord these gifts to our use and us to thy service for Christ 's sake Amen , " and then they all sat down . The four of them ate quietly and dutifully , their eyes on their plates as is the way with families when there is an unresolved crisis amongst them . Afterwards they cleared the table , still in silence ; then Godfrey was sent upstairs to begin getting ready for bed , Mrs. Crundall moved out to wash up with Paul following her , and Mr. Crundall went unhappily into the parlor to set the chairs in a semicircle and fetch the Bible out from the little green-curtained bookcase . 1 N THE kitchen Mrs. Crundall said to her son , though without looking at him , " Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entreaty , not a command . Paul said , " Mother , " as if to begin a sentence , then let out a long breath and said nothing . When the crockery was done , they looked up to see Mr. Crundall standing in the doorway . The woman at the sink glanced from father to son with misgiving , the one perplexed and probably about to bluster , the other  --  but what was the matter with Paul ? The older man was jealous for his God , and his pride was hurt and nettled ; but the boy had been touched in some way in something far deeper than his vanity . He looks , she thought , as if he were somewhere else , and his father and I and this room here and the noise Godfrey is making splashing upstairs are only distracting him . She was suddenly a little afraid . " I 'm going to give you another chance , Paul , " the voice said from the kitchen door . Paul looked as if an image had spoken . It went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the meeting tonight , as I 've asked you the last three times , when you said yes and came . Will you come tonight , Paul ? " " No , I ca n't . You must see that I ca n't , Dad . I 've said why . " MAGAZINE " Paul , " his father said , sitting down in the carpet chair at the head of the kitchen table , " we all go through times like this , when OUT faith is tested . Could n't you trust me , as your father and somebody who knows about these things better than you do , and come ? " " You ca n't know about what you do n't know about . Something happened this afternoon . I ca n't explain , but I do n't think you can help . Perhaps we 're all making a fuss about nothing . I do n't know . " " He 's not being rude really , " Mrs. Crundall put in anxiously . " He 's trying to explain something to us , John . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you tell us , Paul ? We 'd do our best to understand . " " I do n't want to talk about it . " But there was no escape . " I saw something in the hill . I went up into the cave there after school , looking for stones , and saw something , and nothing seems quite the same now . " " What was it ? " " I do n't know . A sort of stone . " " These everlasting stonesl " His father , suddenly infuriated again , was getting to his feet . " Very well , Paul . I do n't want to hear any more from you until you either come back to your duty or explain sensibly to me why not . Get your homework done and then go to bed . That 's the best place for you tonight . " His mother , looking at her son , agreed silently , though for other reasons . N N nouR or so later , the meeting began to assemble . Paul , his work done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already safe ground . He walked slowly along it and opened the door at the far end . Godfrey was asleep . He could account himself alone . Sitting down on his low bed , he made no move to get undressed . The sun must have gone clown behind the hill that backed the little town , for there was a slight grayness in the air and the corners of the room were shadowy , though the long mirror opposite the window sill caught the light in its beveled edges , with diamond gleams of orange and sapphire blue . The child in the farther bed breathed regularly , but he was no quieter than the other who sat on and on for minutes on end . Bumpings of chairs and voices from the room below told him the meeting was beginning . Someone else would read this week ; they would probably pray for him . He felt nothing . All he wanted was to be left quite quiet , his mind as still as a stone till it should have recovered from what had happened that afternoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be difficult in the family . With a sigh more of resignation than anxiety he bent forward to unlace his shoes . At that moment he saw what looked like a spot of blood in the middle of his pillow . He was alarmed for a second , then realized what it was . Godfrey before going to sleep must have laid there , for his brother to see , the little worked stone he had brought home , childlike not wanting his offering to be forgotten . Paul leaned over and picked the tiny thing up . It lay dark and untranslucent in his hand as he curled his fingers over it . It seemed to him as if it were a world that lay there so quiet and diminutive . On any other night he would have taken out his magnifying glass and examined the little jewel minutely , lingering over it , looking up references in his shelf of books on gems and precious stones which stood by his bed and on which he spent , steadily , nearly all his pocket money . That was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been admitted , so he thought , to another , of which none of his books told and which at present he could not manage in his mind at all . He curled two fingers over to hold the little stone firm in the palm of his hand as he stood up and , in his stockinged feet , walked past his brother 's bed to the big ugly yellow dressing table which the two boys shared . On either side of the looking-glass were two little drawers , and it was here that Paul kept his latest collection of stones . He had appropriated them for this purpose at the age of seven , when he had first begun to pick up colored stones , in the garden , along the roads , or up on the rocks and in the caves of those honeycombed hills , and to bring them back for his collection . His mother had protested at first , but later had merely relined the drawers with an extra sheet of paper and left him to it . He had begun by bringing home almost any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inner surface , the inky semi-opacity of flints , the red and white cheesy-looking roundpebbles , the polished cornery ones with their bright browns and yellows . Later he had grown more particular in his choice ; and this evening the drawer when opened , gently so as not to disturb the stones lying there , displayed only small stones , most of them labeled , little lumps of rock crystal or uncut amethyst and garnet . Lying among them was an old ring . It was his mother 's engagement ring , kept here now because Paul had bothered her so often by asking if he might look at the ruby in its solid old-fashioned gold setting . He took it out now as he nearly always did when he came to the drawer , then walked over to the window and looked at the different quality of the red in the two stones he now held . Soon , however , he put the ruby down . The sharp bluish-crimson gleams which it showed when held up to the light said nothing to him this evening . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milkier red having something of yellow and of white in it . That was what the thing in the cave had looked like . And he knew that he had got to think about it some time , and probably now . S OUNDS of chairs scraping and of heavy feet moving about came from below . The meeting was really getting under way now . Standing looking out of the window , the small red stone held delicately between finger and thumb , the boy might have been dreaming ; but he was picturing to himself the scene below , the curious spectacle of eight men kneeling on the floor and praying into the backs of their chairs . Mr. Torton would lead first . Paul imagined he could hear his voice , could almost catch the words . " 0 Lord . .. bless us tonight as once more . . . two or three gathered together in Thy Name . . . . " He stood between the small red stone in his left hand and these words floating up from down below , assailed by each . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on one side , and on the other only the translucence of red stones and a wordless enigma ? He felt a great need to justify himself . He ran a hand in behind his books and found what he wanted , a pad of writing paper . and there was a pencil in his pocket . The meeting below prayed in another voice . " We confess , dear Lord . . . we are all great sinners . . . . " But he sat down on the floor under the window to catch what light remained and began to write his confession . " I , Paul Crundall , hereby bear witness of what happened to me today , " it began , followed by the date . Then there was a long pause . He was afraid of putting this thing into words . Perhaps the little figure in the carved red stone was right , poised so beautifully and saying nothing . He must try to think of it as a report . May we be drawn nearer to Thee , " said the prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went up the hill after school , to have another look at the cave above Banks field . I have often been there before . I took my big electric torch to look at the rocks with . It was about 4:15 P.M. I followed my usual way inside the cave , because then I can be certain of finding my way out again . After the third turning , where it widens out , I stopped to look at the veining on the right-hand wall . The veins are white on red or purple and run down from the roof like hair . In one place near the floor it is particularly beautiful . I thought I would do a quick drawing of it . I got a pencil and an old exercise book out of my satchel , propped up the torch on thefloor so that its light fell on the wall , and began to draw . " I had only just started when I began to feel queer and slightly sick , rather as if I were having to squint the whole time . The veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I were trying to concentrate on the patterned glass of a windowpane when there was something else behind it , but out of focus . So now instead of looking at the veins I brought the torch close to the wall to see if there was anything behind . I touched the wall , which was solid and smooth . The light made it look transparent , as if it had been made of very thick glass . I could look through it in places . Through one of these clear bits I found I could see another cave , lower than the one I was in and feeling as if it were much deeper inside the hill . The torch which I was holding now beside my face against the glassy wall just lighted it There did not seem to be any way in. " p AUL stopped . So far so good , but these had been merely preliminaries . He leaned his head against the window ledge for a moment and closed his eyes . A breath of coolness came in now , and with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below . So they had got that far . He listened to see if he could make out the words and imagined he heard " an alabaster box of ointment " but could not be sure . His fingers were a little unsteady . " It 's getting cold , " he thought ; " I must get this over and go to bed . " The little scratch of pencil on paper went on . " Through the rock I could see in the other cave something that was half a man and half a rock . The man was growing into the rock . Each was both at the same time . The man was white and red and stony , like the rock . He lay in a kind of niche . His left side and arm and leg were grafted into the rock already , but his head was still free and lay comfortably against the right shoulder . It had long red hair . The stone and the body were waxen or ruddy , but hard and polished too and the light seemed to run through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rock and the faint blue marble ones under the skin . It was so beautiful that I was frightened . I turned the torch out , kept absolutely still , and counted to two hundred . Then I turned it on again . The cave and the man were there THE LIVING ROCK just the same . I counted six hundred looking at it . The eyes were open . It did not make me think it was dead . It seemed to be so quiet because it had to grow perfectly , like a sculpture , into the hard and beautiful red rock , as if that were the only thing that mattered . When I got to six hundred my torch began to give out , and I found my way out of the cave and came out onto the hill . I do not know what it is that I have seen but it is something holy . So now I know I must not believe in God any more until I can understand this better . To this I pledge myself . " Signed : Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be signed in blood , and got his penknife out of his pocket , but could only draw enough from one finger to make a smeary cross at one corner of the paper , against which he put , " My Mark . P.J.C. " It was nearly dark and he had some difficulty in reading through his script . They were singing downstairs . The voices felt round for the opening notes of their respective parts , then began , firmly and in good harmony , upon the hymn . The boy shut his mind to it , rereading what he had written . It seemed to him thin and wretched , conveying nothing of what he had seen ; but when he tried to think of better words , they came only in ones and twos , like " calcified " or " lactescent , " or " filmed with shellac " for the eyes , or in odd pairs like " chalcedony and malachite , " which was immediately partnered in his mind by anotherpair , " Chaldean or Amalekite . " But what had that to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a phrase that he thought he must have remembered from somewhere , The tawny lacquer of the hair Among the sleepy stalactites . He wrote it down in the space at the bottom of his last page , only very faintly . His mind was distracted by the determined hymn from down below . What was it they were singing ? " Nothing in my hand I bring . . . . When mine eyelids close in death " . . . . Oh yes , of course . Rock of ages , cleft for me , Let me hide myself in thee . That would be all for tonight . Paul stood up . He folded his paper and put it into the drawer with the stones . He was undressed and was just getting into bed when he saw on the wall above his bedhead the Scripture calendar that had hung there since Christmas . They had each had one , Godfrey 's being a picture of the Nativity , while his had been a rather red and blue representation of the Good Shepherd . True to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do with it , then hung it with the other above his brother 's bed . The child snuffled contentedly in his sleep . It was as if he were pleased at this return present for his own gift of the small red stone , still shut away , the jewel warm against the flesh , in his brother 's closed hand .
