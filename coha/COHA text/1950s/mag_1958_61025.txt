The American heavyweight , who has been without much profit or honor in his own country , lately has taken to traveling abroad to pick up loose change in undeveloped lands where television has not yet wrecked the gate . The results have been most damaging to the prestige of our fellows . Swedish Ingemar Johansson knocked Eddie Machen from second to fifth spot in National Boxing Association ratings . The other night in London Willie Pastrano , who has been ranked No. 3 , was stopped in five rounds by the totally unranked Brian London . And now Zora Folley , No. 1 boy on the NBA rankings sheet , is going to risk his high position in London on Oct. 14 against another Britisher , Henry Cooper . // On paper it does not look like too great a risk . Cooper lost three of his four 1957 fights , two by knockout , and his 1958 record includes a draw with Heinz Neuhaus and a loss to German Light Heavyweight Champion Erich Schoeppner , even though Schoeppner was knocked out . After counting him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the back of the neck . In his last outing Cooper stopped a Welsh heavyweight , Dick Richardson , in five rounds . // So Folley would not seem to be exposing himself to dangerous company . But look at what happened to Machen and observe what happened to Pastrano. // What happened to the agile Willie was pure misfortune . As he came out of a clinch in the third round of his fight with London , Willie was seen to be bleeding from a cut on his left eyelid . It presented no particular problem to him . But at the end of the fifth round , with Willie leading , Referee Jack Hart peered at the cut through his spectacles and stopped the fight , awarding it to London . Pastrano broke down and sobbed in his corner . // The cut almost certainly would have been ignored by an American referee . But the record books will register a knockout defeat for Pastrano for the first time . // Another foreign heavyweight , the 21-year-old George Chuvalo of Toronto , will have a chance at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television debut for both of them Oct. 17 ( Friday ) . McMurtry 's only defeat this year was at the hands of Willi Besmanoff , conqueror of Alex Miteff , with whom Chuvalo was able to register a draw . Still Chuvalo is a slight favorite and is picked in this corner , too . // In the preceding Wednesday night TV show ( Oct. 15 ) , this one from Montreal , Ralph Dupas is a strong favorite over Gil Turner , and it seems reasonable to go along with the early 2-1 odds . Turner has been having a bad year , winning only one fight in four . // FUTURE MIDDLEWEIGHT CHAMP ? // The reopening of famed little St. Nick 's Arena in New York , the most distinguished of small fight clubs , was without benefit of television and attracted its biggest crowd in 11 years , 3,216 shrill customers , a fact that led Boxing Commission Chairman Julius Helfand to observe that " there is nothing wrong with boxing except television . " The crowd came to see a stablemate of Heavyweight Champion Floyd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jose Torres , fights like a middleweight version of Patterson , boxing out of a tight , gloves-up defense and pouring out punches in fabulously fast combinations . It was only his sixth professional fight but he performed like a veteran . His opponent , Otis Woodard , was pronounced unfit to continue by Dr. Samuel Swetnick after the fifth round , a diagnosis that enraged Sugar Ray Robinson , who was in Woodard 's corner . // " Boxing , " Sugar Ray proclaimed , " is all politics . I 'll never fight in New York again under a Helfand administration . And the next time Governor Harriman comes to Harlem I 'll tell him a few things . " // The controversy did not upset Promoter Teddy Brenner a bit . Cheerily , scenting that he might be playing a part in the rise of a future champion , he signed Torres for another fight , this time against Frankie ( Kid ) Anslem on Oct. 13.
