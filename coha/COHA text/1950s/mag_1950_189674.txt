Mexico opened its new 2,178-mile Texas-to-Guatemala highway last week with a thrill-packed six-day auto race for passenger stock models . Mexicans by the millions took the curves and cliffs vicariously , via press and radio . In the capital , people carried portable radios in buses and streetcars to get the blowout-by-blowout reports . <P> Competing for the 300,000-peso ( $34,000 ) top prizes were 132 two-man teams including such hot drivers as Indianapolis Speedway veteran Johnny Mantz , Italy 's Piero Taruffi , winner of the 1948 Grand Prix de Berne auto race , and President Miguel Aleman 's chauffeur , whose handsome new Cadillac , fresh from the palace garage , bore the name Coche Mxico . There was a Los Angeles war veteran driving a 13-year-old Cord , a red-haired torch singer from Mexico City , a Texas grandmother sponsored by a brassiere manufacturer , and a 70-year-old Arizona widow with her 72-year-old ranch foreman . <P> Less than half an hour after the start a Guatemalan , burning up the road in a new Lincoln , missed a turn and was hauled out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coche Mxico , hightailing southward from Ciudad Juarez at better than 100 m.p.h. , screeched off a hairpin curve , rolled over three times into a rocky ditch . The drivers , unhurt , crawled back , started the engine , and somehow finished the day 's lap-in 69th place . In his 1950 Cadillac , ex-Pilot William Sterling of El Paso paced the pack over the first 228 miles at an average 107 m.p.h . <P> Farther south the going grew tougher . After flashing across the baking desert flats , the racers began fading like dead comets in the 10,000-ft. mountain passes around Mexico City . Sterling burned out his brakes , Mantz blew all his tires and developed engine trouble . <P> The last 115-mile leg from Tuxtla Gutirrez to the border was unpaved . The temperature hit 105 . In the end , the race got down to two dogged U.S. drivers : 22-year-old Hershel McGriff , part owner of an auto-repair shop in Portland , Ore. , driving a 1950 Oldsmobile , and Tommy Deal of El Paso , driving a Cadillac . But McGriff 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 16 seconds . Victory was worth 150,000 pesos ( $17,000 ) to him , Co-Driver Pay Elliott and their backers . <P> Though no Mexican finished above eighth , the country was well pleased . The race furnished convincing proof to U.S. tourists that the border-to-border highway is ready for use : Winner McGriff 's average driving speed down the full length of Mexico was 79 m.p.h.
