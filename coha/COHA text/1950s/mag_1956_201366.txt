Depriving the human mind of all sensation is the best preparation for brainwashing . Dr. Robert H. Felix , director of the National Institute of Mental Health , recently told the Senate Appropriations Committee about a new mind-purging technique worked out by Dr. John C. Lilly , one of his Institute colleagues . <P> Serving as his own guinea pig , Dr. Lilly stripped himself naked , put on a skin-diver 's mask for breathing , and was suspended face down in a tank of warm , slowly flowing water . In this " dead man 's float " position , he was almost as out of this world as if he were still unborn . He could see nothing . He could hear nothing except his own breathing and faint water sounds from the piping . Except for the face mask and the gently touching supports , he could feel nothing . The temperature of the water , 94 F. , made it feel neither hot nor cold . <P> Lust &; Reveries . For about 45 minutes , says Dr. Lilly , he was conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensation of being suspended in silence and darkness , with nothing whatever to do . But slowly during the next hour he developed an overwhelming " lust " for any kind of stimulus or action . In spite of his intention to keep perfectly still , he made surreptitious swimming motions or stroked one finger with another . Such small delights gave him great satisfaction . He found that if he denied himself all such stimulus , the tension grew unbearable , and he had to get out of the tank for relief . <P> The peak of tension eventually passed . Then , says Dr. Lilly , " one notices that one 's thoughts have shifted . . . to reveries and fantasies of a highly personal and emotionally charged nature . These are too personal to relate publicly , and probably vary greatly from subject to subject . The individual reactions to such fantasy material also probably vary considerably , from complete suppression to relaxing and enjoying them . " <P> A Black Curtain . After passing his two ordeals of tension and fantasy , which took about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls " projection of visual imagery . " The black curtain that had been hanging in front of his eyes gradually opened into a three-dimensional dark , empty space . The change was striking and intensely interesting ; he waited eagerly to see what would happen next . Then out of the darkness came " small , strangely shaped objects with self-luminous borders . A tunnel whose inside ' space ' seemed to be emitting a blue light then appeared straight ahead . " <P> At this moment Dr. Lilly 's mask started to leak , and he had to get out of the tank to keep from drowning . So he never learned what lay at the end of the blue-lighted tunnel . <P> The " dead man 's float " experiment has been tried so far with only one person besides Dr. Lilly , but other scientists , especially in Canada ( TIME , Oct. 4 , 1954 ) , have subjected many human guinea pigs to degrees of isolation almost as complete . All have reported strange and often alarming effects on the mind , and usually a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
