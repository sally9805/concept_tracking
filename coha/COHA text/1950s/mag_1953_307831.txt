The trouble about gifted men is that they can never escape their gifts . Hilaire Belloc was gifted , and though he wrote millions of words of prose , scored thousands of arguments , everything finally was resolved in rhyme , which was his gift . Nothing in his histories , noted for their dogged Catholicism , is more scathing than his four lines about Protestant Queen Anne 's Lord Treasurer , Godolphin : <P> I heard today Godolphin say <P> He never gave himself away . <P> Come , come , Godolphin , scion of Kings , <P> Be generous in little things . <P> Belloc 's grandmother came from a noted Anglo-Irish family ; his father was a French lawyer ; his mother was a distinguished English suffragette . He was born near Paris and , though educated at Oxford , retained his French nationality long enough to be drafted into the French army . At 32 he became a British subject , and later was elected to the House of Commons . Of his nationalistic duality he wrote : <P> Almighty God will surely say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> With Ireland in his doubtful eyes <P> And Prigord between his hands , <P> And on his arm the stirrup-thongs , <P> And in his gait the narrow seas , <P> And on his mouth Burgundian songs , <P> And in his heart the Pyrenees ? <P> Fancies &; Dogma . His literary career began at Oxford with a book of verse , but he made his name as a walker . He tramped across the Alps from Lorraine to Rome , and his exuberant , youthful Path to Rome is a little classic of exhibitionist travel . For the next half-century , essays , history , epigrams , satires , fiction poured from his pen , sometimes at the rate of five volumes a year . <P> In public lectures and political speeches he talked scornfully over the heads of his audience . He marched into a room , four-square as a quartermaster , his eyes leveled in search of adversaries . The pockets of his tweedy clothes were stuffed with notes and documents , his hard fighting head was bursting with brains , his mouth crammed with literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-humoredly for blows . A member of the old Liberal Party , he pitched his speeches on too high an intellectual level for success ; but the precise malice of his rhymes , directed at the Tory aristocracy , delighted everybody : <P> <P> Lord Finchley tried to mend the <P> Electric Light <P> Himself . It struck him dead : and <P> serve him right ! <P> It is the business of the wealthy man <P> To give employment to the artisan . <P> Belloc held that " all political questions are ultimately theological . " In the debate with the rationalists , he became chief Roman Catholic protagonist , wrote political novels as a counterblast to those of H. G. Wells , pamphlets at George Bernard Shaw and the Fabian Socialists . He converted G. K. Chesterton to the Roman Catholic Church , and a critic has described Shaw addressing the formidable Chesterton : " But there dawned a day-a terrible day for you-when Hilaire Belloc loomed into your life . Then indeed you were lost forever . He made you dignify your monstrosities with the name of Faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your somersaults into sacraments , your oddities into oblations . . . your fun turned to fury . " But Hilaire Belloc could shrug off a critic in three devastating lines : <P> <P> The Llama is a woolly sort of fleecy <P> hairy goat ,
