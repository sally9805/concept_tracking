Australia 's national swimming championships last week wound up a season that has left the record books in tatters . In seven weeks of competition , from the big New South Wales state meet to the nationals in Melbourne , Aussie youngsters had splashed to 31 new world marks . The incredible Konrads kids-Ilsa , 13 , and John , 15 ( TIME , Jan. 20 ) - accounted for 16 all by themselves . Awed Americans are beginning to wonder whether down-under champions are just born swimming in full career . <P> The Konradses ( and just about every other competitor ) can testify to the contrary . The pleasures of sun and sand on Australia 's splendid beaches are among the first things that aspiring swimmers learn to forgo . The surf is too tiring ; besides , there is no time for such fun . Nor is there time for movies , dances and other teen-age pastimes . All winter , the Konradses spend their spare moments at a wearing routine of bodybuilding exercises . All summer , they swim and swim and swim some more-always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 24 ) Coach Don Talbot . <P> A crew-cut teetotaler who grew up on the outskirts of Sydney , Talbot was a fair swimmer himself by the time he went to teachers college at Wagga Wagga . Now Talbot , who used to double as a grammar-school teacher , teaches swimming exclusively ( $12 for ten 15-minute lessons with a beginner , $24 for six months with a competitor ) . His swimmers are his first concern . Says he , " You 've got to really get close to them . You must be an adviser , friend and wailing wall . " Coach Talbot goes to the lengths of prescribing intricate diets ( e.g. , wheat germ , lamb 's fry and 15 vitamin pills a day ) , which his charges follow rigidly . <P> Some Aussie coaches go to other extremes . Talbot 's own teacher , Frank Guthrie , saw to it that Olympic Champ Lorraine Crapp , 19 , got hormone injections to delay her menses before the women 's 440-yd. final in Melbourne last week . Her arm aching from the injections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything worked . He convinced Ilsa Konrads that she would win the 880-yd. title , and though she was suffering from such a bad cold that every breath caused pain in her chest , she won in record time ( 10:16.2 ) . He told John just how fast to swim each lap of both the 440 and the 1650 , and saw John follow orders so closely that the youngster broke six world records on the way to winning both races . In the 1,650-yd. swim , John kicked along so well that he cracked four records before he finished the grind . <P> " I doubt that any of the other coaches could have done what Talbot has done , " says one of Talbot 's colleagues . " We shot our bolts producing an Olympic swimming team . Talbot was a nobody in those days . So he put all his enthusiasm and zeal into making champions of the Konradses . Now it 's Talbot 's turn for glory . "                  @ @ @
