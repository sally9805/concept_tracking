IN Detroit this week , an eleven-year-old dream of a beautiful and functional downtown civic center ( see above ) was approaching reality . On a 76-acre site along the Detroit River , the first buildings of the $100 million project , a 20-story City-County Building and a Veterans Memorial Building , were open to the public . A 2,800-seat auditorium named for Henry and Edsel Ford and a 700-car underground garage were almost finished , and a convention hall and exhibits building , seating 14.000 people , was about to be started . <P> Across the nation , the sound of jackhammers and heavy earth movers told of similar large-scale building projects under way in the hearts of scores of other U.S. cities . Whole blocks of old buildings , acres of overcrowded downtown areas , were being ripped out . In the gaps , new buildings were beginning to rise , units of planned medical , residential and civic centers , set among broad avenues and spacious parks . Examples : In New York , a $40 million Columbus Circle project , almost finished , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office building .

In New Orleans , a new eleven-acre civic center will include a $8.3 million city hall , to be completed next August , a state office building , a library and possibly a court building . <P> Behind this rebuilding and beautifying of U.S. city centers is more than an aesthetic urge .
