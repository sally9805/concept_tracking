The Suez Canal Co. , which has been a hen without a nest since Egypt nationalized its big ditch , last week voted itself another career . In Paris , founder stockholders formally launched , the company into new business worlds as a French investment trust corporation . The Suez Canal Co. will invest $2,800,000 in French companies digging for oil in Algerian Sahara , and already owns a 30% chunk of the planned English Channel tunnel project . Other projects under consideration : oil ventures in Canada , iron deposits in North Africa . <P> The company refused to liquidate principally because it must remain in existence in order to press for compensation totaling $560 million from Nasser 's Egypt . Liquidation would also complicate the unfreezing of $200 million in assets blocked in the U.S. , Great Britain and Switzerland since Suez , and would probably force stockholders to pay French taxes of up to 65% on liquidation proceeds . As matters stand , the company has an estimated $280 million in hand to devote to its projects , but with almost three times that amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role depends very much on whether it can retrieve the value of its frozen and nationalized assets .
