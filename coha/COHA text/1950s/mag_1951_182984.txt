When the Pennsylvania Railroad threw its sickly stepchild , the Long Island , into bankruptcy two years ago , it expected the reorganization to run a normal course . That meant that the Long Island 's $78.6 million debt would be scaled down its fares raised , and the Pennsy would step back into control . But nothing normal everhappens on the Long Island . <P> " First Consideration . " After the rickety railroad killed 110 passengers and injured about 450 in two big crashes last year , NewYork 's Governor Thomas E. Dewey appointed a three-man investigating commission. * Six weeks ago , the commission reported that " the first consideration ... is the complete and permanent separation of the Long Island from control of the Pennsylvania . " Doubting that any private company could make a go of the Long Island the investigators urged that the road be taken over by a nonprofit state authority , relieved of its real-estate taxes and empowered to set its own fares . Although the commission set the Long Island 's debt to the Pennsy at $50 million , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be issued by the authority and proposed that $67.5 million be set aside for new equipment . That would leave only $32.5 million for all creditors . It would leave nothing at all for the Long Island 's single stockholder , i.e. , the Pennsy . <P> Last week , Pennsy President Walter S. Franklin let out an anguished blast at the commission 's plan as " the essence of state socialism at its worst . " He termed it " expropriation " of the Long Island at depressed values caused by years of " oppressive regulation and taxation . " <P> " ReasonableCompensation . " Franklin argued that the Long Island had been denied fare boosts until too late ( 1948 ) to save the road , that it had suffered big increases in real-estate taxes ( almost tripled since 1922 ) , and that it had to put $32 million into such projects as grade crossings , from which it got no revenue benefits . Franklin insisted that the Pennsy would fight to keep the Long Island under private ownership and for " fair and reasonable compensation " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Long Island . <P> But Franklin would have a hard time getting any backing from the Long Island 's angry and politically potent riders . They wanted changes made , and they had already gotten some . Manhattan Investment Banker William H. Draper court-appointed boss of the bankrupt road , had raised $6,000,000 in loans from Manhattan banks to buy new equipment and safety devices which the Pennsy had not installed . <P> . . . <P> In New Jersey , too , the Pennsy had a fight on its hands . A New Jersey grand jury last week charged that the Pennsylvania Railroad " did feloniously kill and slay 84 people in its commuter wreck at woodbridge , N.J. ( TIME , Feb. 19 ) and turned 84 separate manslaughter indictments against the railroad . Conviction would bring a maximum fine of $84,000 . Said Prosecutor Alex Beber : " The fine is not important . The important thing is to fix responsibility . " <P> <P> * Ex-Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson , New York City Parks Commissioner Robert M.
