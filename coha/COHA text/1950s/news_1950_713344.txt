txt The threat to public order in the Philippines has become so grave that President Quirino , acting in accordance with the Constitution , has suspended the right of habeas corpus in cases of sedition and rebellion . This means , specifically , that more than a hundred Hukbalahap suspects , rounded up last week , will not be admitted to bail but will be brought to trial . It means , more generally , that the Government will , from here on , employ sterner measures with the dissidents . Its efforts at appeasement and amnesty have obviously failed . This danger of terroristic rebellion is only part of the crisis that is confronting the . Philippines . It indicates that the rule of law , which broke down completely during the Japanese occupation . has not yet been fully restored . Similarly , the health Of the economic and political community has not been entirely re-established . There is need for prompt and sympathetic assistance from this country to meet the present grave economic situation and to help in building up the sort of free and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their friends , aspire . To plan that assistance more effectively the United States dispatched to the Philippines some months ago a large mission headed by Daniel W. Bell , former Under Secretary of the Treasury . That mission has made its report to President Truman and a copy of it has been forwarded to the Ambassador in Manila , presumably for transmission to President Quirino . The Filipinos are now deeply disturbed because of various suggestions from Washington that this Bell report may not be made public , either wholly or in part . This apprehension seems well founded . It was well known that the Bell report would be critical of many aspects of the present Philippine scene . The Filipinos themselves urged that such criticism be made , and they have joined in it . They know , for example , their present tax structure is bad and that tax collections are woefully deficient . This is no new thing and is not the product of one particular administration or party . It is part of a whole situation to which remedial measures will need to be applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Filipinos should be spared by withholding honest criticism is not tenable . We and the Filipinos are close associates and profound friends . We want earnestly to work out our problems together , It is hard to see how that problem-solving can be furthered by a cloak of secrecy . There is , moreover , always the chance that a report that is " withheld " may also be pigeonholed . It has happened that way in Washington from time to time . This would be a tragedy of the utmost gravity in this time of crisis . Prompt action is imperative . It is certain that action can be taken more speedily if all the pertinent facts , as they have been assembled , are set forth for discussion both here and in the Philippines . That is the democratic and honorable way . Our Filipino comrades are not fearful of what we may say , knowing that we wish ardently to be of what help we can . Why , then , should we be hesitant ?           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
