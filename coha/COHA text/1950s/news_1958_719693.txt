txt A scathing attack on Japanese Premier Nobusuke Kishi for allegedly sabotaging the proposed fourth Sino - Japanese trade agreement has just been leveled by Peking through its controlled nress . The attack , however , wnicn was carried in a Ta Kung Pao editorial April 15 , was worded in such a way as to strengthen the belief of Peking using the trade pact as a political bludgeon aimed at the Conservative government rather than as a vehicle for promoting trade between the two countries . And this belief was strengthened further by the fact that while Peking belabors Mr. Kishi for allegedly sabotaging Sino-Japanese trade , it apparently is going ahead with an even bigger trade deal which it had negotiated earlier with private Japanese steel concerns . Flag Issue Noted Charging that Mr. Kishi resents potential Japanese perialism and pointing out he was a class A war criminal , the editorial claims Mr. Kishi was personally responsible for wrecking the proposed trade agreement . It says Mr. Kishi gave in to Nationalist Formosa on the issue of raising the Chinese Communist flag in Tokyo  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges that Mr. Kishi also gave in to pressure from Washington on this issue . This rejection of Japanese terms for a trade pact was not unexpected . Indeed , when Tokyo gave in to pressure from Formosa over the flag issue , it was a foregone conclusion that Peking would take this as a diplomatic defeat at the hands of Taipei and act accordingly . A significant point to note , however , is that while Tokyo rejected the flag , it . presumably let go through certain other terms which are highly favorable to Peking . These include an agreement to ship goods on the strategic list , setting up of a permanent Chinese trade mission in Japan , and handling financial transactions through the semiofficial Bank of Tokyo . It can only be assumed , therefore , that Peking , while experiencing some injured pride over the flag issue , is itself sabotaging the pact in the interests of applying further political pressure on the Japanese Government . This would fit in. incidentally , with similar pressure which the Soviets presently are applying through Japanese-Soviet fishery talks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the talks that it wo n't give in on restrictions against Japanese fishing in the northern Pacific unless Japan agrees to a favorable peace treaty with Moscow . While Peking charges Japan with sabotaging the pact , a Chinese Communist delegation in Tokyo . continues to negotiate with Japanese steel arms to work out details of a $280,000 , - 000 five-year trade pact which it signed originally with the Japanese in February . Private Pacts Set Under the terms of the pact , Communist China is to exchange iron ore and coal for finished Japanese steel products . Negotiations now going on in Tokyo are to decide on prices . Further refuting the Peking claim that Japan is sabotaging trade , it is reported here that a Japanese businessman concluded a quarter-million-dollar contract merely from the Japanese trade fair recently held in Canton . Another Japanese trade representative recently signed contracts with Chinese state trading officials to ship eight million dollars ' worth of iron , steel , and construction products in return for Chinese ore and foodstuffs .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
