By candlelight , the brothers gathered in the Kappa Sigma fraternity house at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles . With swelling pride , they chanted occult jargon and Tom Sawyerish vows . With stern mien , one night last week they launched an ancient rite : the not-so-gentle art of hazing new members before accepting them into the fraternity with its friendships and parties . <P> Eleven pledges appeared . All endured such muscle-straining exercises as strenuous pushups . Then came a sickening test . <P> <P> One by one , the pledges were marched to a buffet table . On a tray lay thick slices of oil-soaked raw liver , each about the size of a club sandwich . Gagging and coughing , the first six pledges managed to get the liver down without chewing it ; that was part of the ritual . <P> Pledge No. 7 was blue-eyed Richard T. Swanson , 21 , of Hollywood , a freshman at the U.S.C. dental school . He tried to swallow the liver three times , gagged , removed it , tried once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought for breath . The brothers swatted his back , laid him face down across the table . The liver remained in his throat . Swanson struggled to his feet , stumbled out the door and collapsed . Someone called an ambulance . <P> What happened next is the subject of angry argument . The ambulance attendant says that the frightened boys told him only that Swanson had " a spasm in his throat , " never mentioned the meat , which he could easily have removed . A fire department resuscitator squad that was called to the scene backs up his story . The boys deny the charge , insist that the rescuers carelessly placed the victim on his back . Whatever the truth , on arrival at Los Angeles Central Receiving Hospital at 1:48 a.m. , less than two hours after he began to choke , Dick Swanson was dead . <P> Shocked university officials suspended Kappa Sigma from the campus , put all 49 members on probation . The house was shut down for good , the first such action in U.S.C. history . Said grieving Arthur L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are guilty of taking my brother 's life . "
