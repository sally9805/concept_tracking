Sometimes the U.S. and its European partners get so busy with their own noisy spats , shufflings and disappointments that they fail to hear the scuffling on the other side of the Iron Curtain . But last week , in the aftermath of Czechoslovakia 's Slansky trial , the scuffling could be plainly heard , and louder than usual . <P> Four years ago the Communists resolved to turn their seven East European satellites from what was once Europe 's granary into Russia 's arsenal . This was the Molotov Plan , to counter the Marshall Plan , and it got a bureaucratic name : KOMEKON. + The goal was gargantuan : to create a new industrial empire , 90 million strong . The cost , in hardship , did not matter . <P> In KOMEKON , Eastern Europe today has economic union , while Western Europe still debates it . The U.N . last month reported with surprise that Eastern Europe 's trade , " including the U.S.S.R. , appeared to have increased tenfold since 1938 , " while Western Europe 's was up only 38.9% . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain , the sacrifice , the sabotage and the suffering is also immense - and sizable enough for the Communists themselves to acknowledge . From their own propaganda broadcasts , from hour after monotonous hour of " selfcriticism " at the Czech purge trials , from intelligence studies of East Europe 's censored , servile press last week , came these portents of KOMEKON 's troubles : <P> East Germany , said its boss , Communist Party Secretary Walter Ulbricht , suffers because it has " failed to assimilate progressive Soviet science and technology . " There are shortages of steel , coal , power , labor and transport , he told the Communist Party Central Committee , because " some people are still strongly influenced by religion , and believe that Socialism will come from Heaven . This is erroneous . " From the sovietized Bergmann-Borsig engineering works in East Berlin , Communist inspectors reported : " Working according to schedule is an extremely rare event . . . An average of ten substandard cylinder heads has been made for every one that was up to standard . " At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reporters from Neues Deutschland , official organ of the German Communist Party , found Foreman Horst Kewitsch angrily complaining : " Serious ... is the lack of replacement parts . To keep working , we have had to replace parts in Furnace Two with parts from Furnace Three ; now , we have to replace the missing parts from Furnace Three with parts from Furnace Four . " Carpenter Giinter Blankenburg groused that the solitary electric bulb in his barracks gives " less light than a candle flame . " But the chief complaint was lack of food : " Sometimes , " said Walter Jerkisch , " you ca n't buy butter or margarine at all . . . "
