txt Officials of the Portuguese Bend teach club cited this example of burocracy at work : . A dead seal washed up on the beach . It smelled ripe , so the club called the coast guard to have it hauled away . A little out of our line , the coast , guard said . Try the sherif . And on , and on It Goes No , the sherif 's office advised . This was a job for the county lifeguards . The lifeguards decided the humane society was responsible . Better call the county road department , the humane society directed . Net for us , the road department declared . This is a job for the air pollution board . From there the clubmen went to the parks and recrehtion department , which shunted the job off to the health department . The health department passed it along to the department of sanitation , which seemed logical enough . Back Where They Started No , this is n't our type of work at all , the sanitation department explained . You 'd better call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they started . What did they do ? What could they do ? They rented a truck , tied handkerchiefs over their faces , and removed the seal themselves .
