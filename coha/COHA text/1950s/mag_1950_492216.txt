THAT MAN COOPER BYPETE. , , , F , as some of the tougher and more gristle- I minded students of Hollywood believe , success , instead of failure , is that community 's unforgivable sin , Gary Cooper is one of its greatest sinners . Since he appeared in The Winning of Barbara Worth , in 1927 , he has switched on his slow grin and his special brand of hard-to-ignite masculinity in sixty-three movies . Among them they have grossed enough millions ? 160 in all ? to impress even a Texas oil baron whose wife buys her mink coats by the gross . In 1948 Gary was second only to Bing Crosby as a male drawing card . Clark Gable alone has crashed the annual top-ten box-office-popularity varsity oftener . In 1940 , Gary 's salary was the largest paid to anyone in the United States . It , was the Fist time a movie star had pulled down the nation 's heaviest sugar . Until then , our leading Midases had been such industrial big shots as Thomas J. Watson , Pooh-Bah of The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monarch of The American Tobacco Company . It has been estimated that Cooper has accumulated a nest , egg of gilt-edged investments the size and shape of a Navy blimp , and that out of this he has set aside a $1,000,000 trust fund to care for himself and his family in his old age . As if all this were not a diet of triumphs too rich to be digested by Cooper 's rivals who 've never eaten that high off the hog , popular acclaim has also dubbed him with a kind of knighthood , an extra helping of glory , which gives many of those who have not been so honored incurable cases of heartburn . The New York Times has called him " the incorruptible Galahad of movieclom . " It . has been said that " he has enjoyed the wonderfully lush rewards of screen holiness " ; that " his screen decalogue has been a combination of the Bill of Rights , the Ten Commandments and the Atlantic Charter . " Like many other social groups , Hollywood has its own peculiar tribal customs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spears to razor-sharpness , the better to sink them into the backs of those lucky enough to make happy talk with its No , 1 god ? Box Office . If I had remembered this habit of the natives who dwell in the spacious grass huts overlooking Hollywood , it would have saved me much distress of mind when I drew the assignment of putting Cooper down on paper . For I had n't worked long on the Cooper story before I ran into a wholly unexpected amount of Cooper back-stabbing and belittling . Like other non-Holiywoodians , I had thought of him as shy , unassuming and sincere , a kindhearted Good Sam , with no disfiguring affectations clinging to him as egg clings to an untidy vest . But while briefing myself on Cooper , I 'd met two Hollywood men who 'd told me that the man I was casing is a myth ; an illusion concocted of hot air and artfully angled publicity ; a sleight-of-hand trick six feet two and three-quarter inches tall . Moreover , they boasted that they were the illusionists who had " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the flying squadron of characters with vaguely defined duties that any studio employs to  --  among other things  --  throw a downfield block between the columnists and fan-magazine writers and stars who do n't wish to be tackled by such inquisitive way-layers . The first of these " Cooper inventors " told me , " The Gary Cooper 1 thought up was the All-American Boy . With the passing years he 's become the All-American Man , but the character I cooked up for him is basically still the same . That character needs two heads . One of them is always bloody from taking beatings for virtue 's sake . " This Cooper originator said that he had helped map out some of the material that had gone into a number of Gary 's interviews . A part of his plan was to make the interviewers think that Gary talked only in grunts , thereby keeping them from approaching the lanky star close enough to ask any questions . And Cooper was tickled pink at not having to sit through boring sessions of " Mr. Cooper , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cinema as an art form , Mr. Cooper ? " My informant claimed that after the purveyors of syndicated pabulum and the fan-publication Boswells had been stuffed with such fabrications , they were handed overto a guide who ledthem through the studio commissary while Gary was eating . There they bad waved to Gary , and Gary had waved back . That way , when they told their editors that they 'd seen him , " they could pump conviction into their words . " The other self-admitted Cooper originator said proudly , " I helped teach the public to think of him as the man who always avenges a wrong . I helped sell them the notion that he 's always in there punching for the little fella who 's taking a bouncing around . Once people got this pitch , they kept right on believing in Gary as democratic and heroic ; as the simple man who 's achieved greatness , but , although his greatness bewilders him , it has n't changed him a snitch . " In addition to such cracks , I 'd run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrangle about when it discusses Cooper . These word battles between Cooper 's defenders and those who delight in giving him a verbal hosing usually begin with one of the following queries : Can he act ? " . " Is his conversation limited to uglis ' or can he actually talk when the sound track 's not listening ? " " Is he really an ' aw-shucks ' character , unable to enter a drawing room without kicking a few imaginary clods around , or is his homespun exterior a synthetic veneer concealing high-hat-society yearnings ? " One Hollywood native asked nastily , " Is he like his bighearted screen characters or is he , in private life , an Ebenezer Scrooge type , concerned only with what 's in it for Cooper ? " I am a charter-member Cooper addict myself , and such cynicism upset me . So I decided to drop in on a bubble-shaped man named Jack Moss , who at one time had been Cooper 's business manager , and put the " Can he act ? " question to him . " That , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has baffled some of the beet brains in picture business . It even temporarily stopped a top-notch director we 'll call Jones . " As Moss told it , when Jones directed Gary in one of his most successful pictures , he began to shoot the film on a Monday . The following Thursday , Jones called Moss on the phone to ask , " Can you come right over ? " From the lone of his voice , Moss could tell that Jones was unhappy . When he got there , the director led him to one aide , where they could be alone . " What 's wrong with this Cooper , anyhow ? " Jones asked . " He 's not only dead on his feet , his face is dead too . Does n't he sleep nights ? " " He sleeps fine , nights , " Moss said . " Then why does nothing happen when he 's up there in front of the camera ? All I get out of him is a blank look . He 's ruining me ! " " Coop does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soothingly . " He does n't shoot off emotions like a Roman candle . " Then he inquired , " Have you looked at the footage you 've already shot ? " " What 's that got to do with it ? " Jones asked . " I never look at my rushes the first week . " " You 'd better look at these , " Moss told him . " I can only tell you that when the light reflected from Coop 's face hits the raw emulsion on film something happens . I do n't know what it is . " Jones broke his rule and looked at his first week 's rushes . His anxiety evaporated . On the projection-room screen he saw the astute underplaying that later helped him cop an award for a good job of directing . " This story is no bum rap at Jonea , who 's close to being a genius , " Moss said to me . " I 'd gone through the same crises with some of the hottest directors in this town , including Ernst Lubitsch . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had exactly the same experience with Cooper . " I thanked Moss , but said that I was afraid his answer had been inconclusive . " Why do n't you ask Walter Brennan ? " he suggested , " He knows acting when he sees it . He 's been in several pictures with Cooper and he 's won more Oscars for acting ability in supporting roles than anyone else in Hollywood . " When I located Brennan , he told me , " I used to think that Coop was just a screen personality and that he relied on that to get him by . I 've changed my mind . They like to say that no matter what role he plays , he 's always Cooper . But I 've seen him do scenes in which he was n't Cooper at all , and he was still convincing . " Hollywood 's habit of sneering at Cooper 's acting annoys Brennan . " When it cornea to technique , his is effortless , " he said . " And for that reason , it 's one of the beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is carefully studied out and is beautifully done . He may have only one trick  --  that of being natural and relaxed but it 's one of the hardest tricks for an actor to do . Cast in the right part in the right movie , his underacting , naturalness and casualness are mighty effective . " ? I had already found out that Cooper 's casualness has threatened to give more than one director a stroke . Sometimes , when they 're ready to shoot , he 's absent from the set , popping away at a tin can for target practice while blood pressures and the overhead zoom . " I had to organize a bike posse to tail him , " an assistant director told me . " Sometimes we 'd find him tinkering in the electrical shop . Sometimes he 'd be sleeping with his back propped up against the sunny side of a stage . " The classic tale of Gary 's ability to relax concerns the filming of a scene in which the audience was supposed to think he had been catapulted from an automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowdrift while the camera peered down at him , he took his position on a mound of corn-flake snow . The director called , " Let ' er roll ! " and , when Cooper had been photographed from several angles , yelled , " Cut ! " Gary kept right on lying in the corn flakes . He had fallen fast asleep . But there has never been anything casual about Cooper 's patriotism , although another Gary detractor had managed to slur even that in talking to me . " If you ca n't get him to talk about anything else , try Americanism , " he 'd said contemptuously . " He 's a sucker for it . " He had n't explained his disdain for Cooper 's Americanism , but the reason behind it was n't hard to figure out . In 1947 Cooper had appeared before the House Committee on Un-American Activities to testify about " the communist infiltration of the motion-picture industry . " His testimony had n't been flashy ; it had contained no block buster revelations . He 'd merely reported that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States is a hundred and fifty yearn out of date , " made at a Hollywood gathering , and that he 'd once turned down a script because " its leading character was a man whose ambition was to organize an army in the United States that would n't fight to defend the country . " But the mere fact that Cooper had appeared before the committee at all was reason enough for those with fellow-traveler tendencies to sneer at his Americanism , including the one who 'd suggested that I use it as a conversational cork-puller . Not that smearing Cooper 's kind of Americanism is by any means universal in Hollywood . If a poll of movie makers were taken to select the most typically American actor , the tall Montanan would be an odds-on favorite to win . So fixed is this conviction in the minds of those who know him that when he was chosen , as the man who would best exemplify the quintessence of Yankeeness , to star in the cinema life of Lou Gehrig , the executives of the studio that made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had never played the most typical American game , baseball . Hurriedly , he was put through an intensive series of batting and throwing sessions , while the publicity men who handled the picture kept the shameful fact that its star had never even shagged a pop fly a top secret . Next , someone belatedly noticed that Cooper was right-handed , while , as even the citizens of Kamchatka were likely to know , Gehrig had been a southpaw . To get around this difficulty the " NY " on Cooper 's uniform was reversed , and the action was shot at third base instead of at first . Then the negative was reversed , transforming the right-handed screen Gehrig into a portsider . In spite of such technical bean balls having to be ducked in production , 13,857,143 people have seen the Cooper portrayal of Gehrig . This number includes its second release . No fewer than five Cooper re-releases are now playing the country 's theaters . After seeing Brennan , I tried to get the lowdown on some of the other queries that embroil the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question : " Is his homespun exterior a synthetic veneer that conceals high-hat-society yearnings ? " a writer who has known Gary since 1927 had THE SATURDAY this to say , " Gary has never liked bums . He likes people with class , which may be why people without much class resent him . Nor does class necessarily mean having money or social position , although it has a stubborn way of paying off in those two things . " I discussed the theory that " Cooper is an Ebenezer Scrooge , What's-in-itfor-me ? " ' character with his present business manager , I. H. Prinzmetal . " I 've never seen it . in print anywhere , " Prinzmetal said , " but Gary practically endows a summer camp for Jewish boys between the ages of fifteen and eighteen . The idea is to teach them to be better Jews and better Americans . It costs him plenty . " The hotly debated question , " Is Cooper 's conversation limited to ' ughs ' or can he actually talk when the sound track 's not listening ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated to me was one involving Slim Talbot . For years Talbot served as Gary 's stand-in . In that time Gary was said to have spoken fewer than 200 words to him . Cooper and Slim had shared a tent on location in Arizona . One night when a sandstorm began to blow , they 'd rushed out to hold the tent down , and Slim bad yelled , " Big blow , ai n't it ? " For hours they battled flapping canvas , until a violent gust tore it from their hands . As they ran for the nearest shelter , Gary is said to have shouted , " Sure is ! " I 'd had trouble arranging a date with Cooper  --  twice he 'd flown across country to the bedside of his ill mother-in-law ? and it began to look as if I would have to leave Hollywood without seeing him . That , together with wondering if he 'd say anything when we did meet , had given me a " What's-the-use ? " attitude about my assignment . When at last my interview with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabbed an imaginary clump of dirt with his foot and mumbled , " I do n't know why anybody would want to read anything about me , " I thought , If that 's the way he wants it , I 'll exchange a few polite monosyllables with him and call it a day . I said , " If you do n't see any point in my doing a story about you , let 's forget it . " Somehow , from that point on , things failed to follow schedule , and two hours later we were still talking . Somebody had tipped me wrong , not only about his inability to unbutton his mouth but about a lot of other things . I tried to discover the phoniness his belittlers had told me about . Instead , I found him quietly likable . Our talk rambled on while I tried to remember it . He bad been born on May 7 , 1901 , to Charles H. and Alice Cooper , in Helena , Montana . Charles Cooper had " read for the law " in the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had served as clerk in the local court . In 1906 he 'd bought a 600-acre railroad-grant-land ranch forty miles from Helena . " He lost his shirt ranching , " Gary told me . " The old bonanza days of soaring land values were over and he was too honest to ever make much out of law . " In 1910 Mrs. Cooper was convalescing from a serious illness and her doctor suggested that she take a sea voyage . Her husband decided to take her to England and enter nine-year-old Gary in the English school ? Dunstable Grammar ? he had attended himself as a boy . Gary 's principal memory of his life at Dunstable is a fight he had with the townies , who taunted him about wearing the school cap . To his amazement , his defense of his honor failed to gain the approbation of his schoolEVENING POST mates . " Can you imagine those little snobs ? " he asked me . " They said , ' You should n't fight newsboys . You might get your hands dirty . ' " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manpower shortage made the going tough at the ranch . Unable to get help , Gary 's parents took their spindly son out of school in Helena and put him to work as a ranch hand . For two years Gary and his mother ran the ranch while his father kept on with his legal chores in Helena . Of those years Gary told me , " Getting up at five o'clock in the dead of winter to feed four hundred and fifty head of cattle and shoveling manure at forty below ai n't romantic . " In his fifteenth year he grew , weedlike , an amazing thirteen inches . When he went back to school he was so much taller than other boys his age and so far behind them in his classes that rejoining them gave him an inferiority complex . Concerned about him , his parents sent him to an agricultural school at Bozeman , Montana , where the farm boys in his classes matched him more closely in size and knowledge . From Bozeman he entered Grinnell College , in Iowa . Having served one year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to administer the estates of two cousins who had died in San Diego . In 1924 Gary quit . Grinnell to join his parents in Los Angeles . He peddled sittings for a photographic studio from door to door . When this huckstering failed to pay , he switched to selling advertising space on a theater curtain . Two weeks later his new boss went out of business . " I was , " he told me , " not what you could call an aggressive salesman . " Luckily , he met two Helena friends who told him that the Fox Western Studios were looking for riders . Folding his long legs into the family jalopy , Gary jolted out to the Fox lot to join the crowds waiting outside the studio gates until the casting director emerged to select the riders he needed for a day 's shooting . In a few weeks Gary found himself in a combination costume and horse opera . In it everyone wore silk pants instead of chaps , plumed headgear instead of ten-gallon hats , and during those moments when they were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cow pokes . Gary watched Tom Mix ride his faithful horse Tony up a flight of stairs to doff his plumed hat to the beauteous Billie Dove , and listened bug-eyed to the gossip about Mix 's fabulous salary . January 14. 1950 Being young , and therefore naive and presumptuous , he decided to catch up with Mix . He figured that it might take as much as a year , but to lose no time , he employed an agent to speed him to riches . A woman who worked in his agent 's office took a liking to him and suggested that he change his name . He had been christened Frank James Cooper , but there were two other Frank Coopers already in pictures , one of them a stunt man , the other a character actor , and his adviser pointed out that this situation could breed confusion . To the Helena Frank Cooper , a new label seemed a fancy-pants move , and he refused to part with the one his parents had given him . But when he read that a fourth Frank Cooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a blond floozy , he gave in . Since his woman adviser was from Indiana , the name of a city in that state was the first one to float to the top of her mind , and Helena 's Frank James Cooper became Hollywood 's Gary Cooper . Equipped with a new name , Gary redoubled his efforts to supply a new career to go with it . He gave one of his daily pay envelopes to a make-up man for teaching him how to paint a cupid 's bow on his lips and how to slather on eye shadow . His former photographic-studio employer made him a sheaf of glossy portraits of himself to show casting directors . In some of them he tried to look like Rudolph Valentino , hair goo , heavy-lidded eyes and all . Henry King was the first movie maker of note to see screen possibilities in the renamed Montana rider . In 1927 King was engaged in a movie-making pact with Sam Goldwyn , and had drawn the assignment of directing a western , The Winning of Barbara Worth . One morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man sitting on a rump as slim as a bullfighter 's , with his arms wrapped around his legs . " Who 's that ? " King asked his assistant director . " Name 's Cooper , " the assistant director answered . " Says he 'd give his left arm to talk to you . " Walking up to the youngster , King said , " O.K. Let 's talk ! " " He was so nervous I had to pull the words out of him , " King told me of that meeting . But he did manage to say , ' I 'd like the Lee part in your movie . ' " Ronald Colman was starred in the picture and Lee was its second male role . King had already signed a man as Lee , but that actor was working at Warner Brothers , and Warners was n't through with him . Gary had with him in a tin can a small roll of film showing his prowess as a horseman . He had had it shot on Poverty Row at a cost of twenty-five dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , went into the projection room and had the film run off . A horse came at him at a dead run . Its rider got off and ducked under a rail . That was all . King had a test lined up for another actor , who was supposed to lean over a water hole and drink , and he asked Cooper to try it . What Gary did resembled nothing the trained actor had done . He blew the dust from the top of the water , then dippered it to his mouth with his hands . It was n't artistic but it was real ; the way life in Montana had taught him to do it . " The Lee part is already filled , " King told him , " but if you want to ride and do bits for me , I 'll pay your expenses and fifty bucks a week . " When the Barbara Worth company went on location , the Lee from Warners still was n't available , so King put Cooper into Lee 's clothes and used him for long shots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close-up was coming up . Lee was supposed to arrive hone-weary , after being in the saddle for twenty-four hours , knock at a door , and collapse as he opened it . King spent an hour building up a feeling of exhaustion in Gary . He wet the tall boy 's face , sprayed it with fuller 's earth and made him walk up and down all morning without stopping . By noon the fuller 's earth on Cooper 's face had dried and cracked , and his walk had slowed to a shuffle . When Gary appeared in the doorway his knock was a ghost knock and his face was ghastly . Opening his mouth , be slumped forward . Colman caught him , carried him to a bed , and King shot a close-up . When he viewed the scene in the projection room , he knew that Warners could keep their Lee . Both King and Goldwyn took it for granted that the other had signed their discovery to a contract . But in the hurry-scurry of cutting the picture and titling it , each of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him not to let his gratitude keep him waiting any longer for King or Goldwyn to remember him , led him straight to Paramount . Cooper was told to leave his agent in an anteroom and go into the office of B. P. Schulberg , then Para-mount 's head man . There he found himself facing a mass meeting of the studio 's executives . His knees buckled and he tried to speak , but he could only gulp and give out an embarrassed grin . Those assembled looked at that grin , nodded to one another , and Schulberg said , " How 'd you like to work for us ? We 're offering you a term contract . " The shock was so great that Gary forgot the usual Hollywood routine of saying , " See my agent , " and the squiggle of a pen made him a Paramount contract player at $150 a week . For less than two minutes he appeared in Wings , a movie that starred Richard Arlen and Buddy Rogers as aviation cadets . The script called for them to bunk in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the seasoned flier greeted the fledgling birdmen , Rogers and Arlen offered him a chocolate bar . Cooper took a bite , put what was left on his cot , and turned to go . At the tent door besaid , with " a look of presentiment " : " When your time comes you 're going to get it " ; then stalked out . There was a roar as Cooper 's plane became airborne , followed by an earth-jarring crash . The cadets sat there horror-struck . Presently another flier came in , collected Gary 's belongings and departed . The camera peered at the chocolate bar . One of the cadets solemnly picked it up and wrapped it in a scarf as a keepsake . It was the production 's sock moment . People forgot other things about it , but they remembered " that tall flier who died . " Despite the fact that it had taken him only two minutes to steal a whole movie , not just a single scene , Paramount could n't get the notion out of its mind that Cooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he appeared only in such " they-went-thataway " oaters as Arizona Bound and Nevada . But in time , the studio began to notice that when he was introduced to a woman visitor on his set , she went away patting her hair thoughtfully , and wondering if she had on enough lipstick . After a solemn conclave , it was decided to try him in a non-Western picture , to see if meeting him on a screen would have the same effect upon women who preferred something more subtle than dramas featuring galloping horses , whiskery bad men and cowboys who used toothpicks right in front of everybody . Cast as " Ted Larrabee , a sleek playboy , " Cooper was stirred into a spicy film casserole called Children of Divorce , along with the It Girl , Clara Bow , and Esther Ralston . There was , however , a stumbling block to be surmounted before the potential matinee idol could work his old black magic on distaff America . Cooper was the most inept screen lover who ever reached for a pliant waist , and his effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " I could n't make love to a girl with a camera snooping at me , " he told me . " It just did n't seem decent , especially with a girl I hardly knew . " When the front office jerked him from the picture , its director , Frank Lloyd , protested so vociferously that he was put back in . Lloyd promised the around the usual California tennis court . They raise dogs , ducks , chickens , and cultivate a not-so-usual vegetable garden and citrus grove . Occasionally they go hunting together in the mountains near Malibu . The same fanatical loyalty that kept Gary 's premarital amours from curdling his fans ' affection for him governs their reaction to his films . He has been in bad pictures , but to his followers he has n't been bad in them . They blame everybody else  --  the director , the producer , the camerman ? never Gary . Nor is this loyalty restricted to Gary 's fans . Jerry Wald , a Hollywood producer , said , " Most actors think they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the preview of Task Force , Cooper came up to me , shook my hand and said , ' Thanks very much . ' ' For what ? ' I wanted to know . ' For a good picture , ' he said . I 'd never had an actor do that before . Usually they say , ' Do n't you think the camera lingered too much on that other fellow ' ? ' Thanks is the world 's cheapest commodity , but in Hollywood it 's mighty rare . " Now that he is pushing fifty , the lines in Cooper 's face are deeper . But the November 2 , 1949 , issue of Variety reported that , of the films shown during the previous month , Task Force was the fourth-biggest money maker , and it credited Gary 's popularity as " the biggest single item in selling the film . " When Grandfather Ezio Pinza , costar of South Pacific , recently signed a fat long-term movie contract , much was made of the fact that the majority of possessors of male sex appeal  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucks  --  are middle-aged . Current standards in male charm call for a touch of gray at the temples and the maturity of a Walter Pidgeon , a Cary Grant , a Clark Gable , a Ronald Colman , a Robert Montgomery , a Gen. Hoyt Vandenberg or a Viscount Mountbatten . Not long ago , when Bette Davis departed from Warner Brothers , her dressing room was given , not to a stripling wringer of squeals from bobby soxers , but to Gary Cooper . Gary had never before beefed about the size and shape of his dressing room , but the grandeur of the Davis studio diggings so bothered him that he insisted that they be halved before he moved in . This is the only known example of Cooper 's being intractable . He has never refused to work with a director , a leading lady or a cameraman . He has never complained about his billing . He has never asked for special favors . In Hollywood these things are even rarer than thanks .
