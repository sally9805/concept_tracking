WHEN a minor office-holder hanged himself in the basement of his Philadelphia home on May 22 , 1948 , the exposes whith followed dealt a heavy blow to the Republican machine . Since then the Republicans have failed to win a single election in a city in which their dominance had been proverbial : Truman carried the city in the 1948 Presidential election ; in 1949 the Democrats , though out-registered nearly three to one , defeated e the " City Hall gang " ; the next year the Democratic candidate for governor won comfortably in Philadelphia , narrowly missing election ; and in 1951 the city adopted a new charter over the opposition of the G. 0 . P. machine . The adoption of the charter , even more than the previous defeats , showed that the electorate had come to the end of its patience . It was then that the Republican bosses realized their desperate plight . The nirrht the city charter wasadonted Morton Wit-kin , acknowledged " brains " of the City Hall machine and one of the country 's ablest ward leaders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boys , " he is said to have remarked , " that does it . The Old Guard 's got to take a back seat . From here on the independents are flying the Republican kite . They lead ; we should follow . Let the Charterites call the tune . Who do they want for mayor and D. A. ? I 'll take them . I 'm a Republican first and a machine man second . " On another occasion he chided one of his lieutenants : " We took a licking , yes , but if only you guys would learn how to take a licking . " The first step in the learning process was , of course , to select a man of impeccable character and outstanding achievement as the Republican candidate for mayor . The inspiration came at a cocktail party . William Morrow , a former deputy sheriff , now chairman of the Republican City Committee , was chatting with a group of doctors . " You fellows get around , " he said , " you get to know people . Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run for mayor ? " One of the group replied , " That 's easy ? Dan Poling . " " Dan " Poling is the Reverend Daniel Alfred Poling , CHARLES R. ALLEN , JR. , a member of The Nation 's staff , , is a native Philadelphian. an internationally known Baptist clergyman . Now sixty-six , Poling has the energy of a man half his age . In addition to having served as pastor of the two largest Baptist churches in the United State s  --  the three-hundredyear-old - Marble Collegiate Church in New York and the Grace Baptist Temple in Philadelphia  --  he has been president of the World Christian ' Endeavor Union . He edits the money-making Christian Herald , financed with the help of J. C. Penney 's millions , and directs the activities of numerous charities  --  all debt free , as the Republicans like to point out . No newcomer to politics , Dr. Poling was candidate for governor of Ohio on the Prohibtion ticket in 1912 . He is chairman of the All-American Conference to Combat Communism . Poling was obviously the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was how best to improvise a draft . The formal proposal that Poling should run came from the Republican Citizens ' Committee , which was supposed to be quite independent of the Republican City Committee . The Citizens ' Committee was headed by John R. Diemand , president of the Insurance Company of North America , and William A. Schnader , former attorney general of Pennsylvania , known to many Philadelphians through the ribbing of the Inquirer as " King William the First . " Under the committee 's prompting Dr. Poling announced that he intended to file for the nomination but could be " stopped . " No one stopped him , and he was welcomed by the Republican City Committee as the man who " assented to become the candidate for the mayoralty of this great city . " Dr. Poling then strengthened the illusion of spontaneity by declaring , " I did not seek your invitation but I can not find it in my conscience to refuse . " But the machine now encountered resistance within its ranks . Walter P. Miller , a local manufacturer and former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would file too , charging that a thoroughly discredited organization was taking refuge behind the robes of a clergyman . " He 's a fine man , " said Miller , " but underneath Dr. Poling you have an absolutely machine-dominated slate  --  the same old machine control . " Mort Witkin argued that the Republican machine had been " improperly " smeared and that in any case Dr. Poling 's name on the slate was insurance against a recurrence of objectionable practices . Dr. Poling described the situation somewhat ' differently : " The Republican city administration is not , never has been , and never will be an administration ' rotten through and through ' . . . but there have been flagrant delinquencies on the part of certain city officers . " The fact that profane deeds had been committed " by venal men , " he added , should not be permitted to " obscure out sight . " Witkin insisted that a new day had dawned for the G. 0 . P. , but some of the ward leaders began to mutter . Then  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders of the Thirty-second and Fifty-first wards to hand in their resignations . Both leaders , who incidentally had been arrested but later cleared of graft charges , complied forthwith . Enthusiasm ran high for Poling as the primaries " approached , and when the votes were counted , the Republican nomination was his by a plurality of 130,000 . Dr. Poling 's candidacy is being carefully watched for its bearing on the 1952 election . The Grundy machine was supposed to have been hopelessly vanquished during Senator Duff 's tenure as governor , but while it has lost a measure of power , it has a chance to come back next year . The present governor , John S. " Fine , is a Grundy man , and Dr. Poling 's candidacy is being directed by the Grundy machine : His campaign manager , William J. Hamilton , Jr. , ward leader in the Twenty-first District , is a dependable member of the Grundy faction , and William A. Schnader , who was one of his earliest supporters , is close to the Grundy clique . With one exception , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Poling . Harold E. Stassen , known in Philadelphia as a Grundy man , has also indorsed him . Some independent observers in Philadelphia hesitate to believe that Dr. Poling is simply a " front " for the discredited City Hall machine and are inclined to think that if elected he might possibly clean house . They wonder , however , whether the price for this type of " good government " might not be the curtailment of social services . Others say that Dr. Poling would be forced to work with the machine If elected . While Witkin 's strategy of turning a " licking " to good account , may bring the Republicans back to power , the Democrats have an able candidate for mayor in Joseph S. Clark , Jr. , and for district attorney in Richardson W. Dilworth . The election on November 6 will therefore in all probability be extremely close . Back in 1903 Lincoln Steffens described Philadelphia as " corrupt and contented . " He also pointed out that the exposure of corruption often made it possible for a discredited machine to ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed little in Philadelphia from that day to this . Should Dr. Poling be elected , he will have a chance to prove that Steffens- was wronge
