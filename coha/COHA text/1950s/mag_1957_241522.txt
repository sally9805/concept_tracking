TO win a throne for himself , the legendary Greek hero Jason sought and found the fabled Golden Fleece , outward symbol of all that was most rich and rare . Today 's Jason is another golden Greek , the modern-day Argonaut Stavros Spyros Niarchos , 48 ( TIME , Aug. 6 , 1956 ) , whose tanker fleets gird the globe , bring in a train of wealth and credit that affords Niarchos comforts and pleasures beyond even Jason 's imaginings . Niarchos has a Long Island estate , a Manhattan triplex , a penthouse atop London 's Claridge 's , a princely htel particulier in Paris , a $575,000 Riviera villa and the largest privately owned sailing vessel afloat , the three-masted Creole . But his real Golden Fleece is his art collection . <P> Evidence of how far Stavros Niarchos has come in only eight years of collecting will be displayed next month when his top 63 paintings ( valued at more than $5,000,000 ) will go on exhibit for charity at Manhattan 's Knoedler Gallery , then will travel in February to Ottawa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French impressionists was well under way , the paintings in the Niarchos show will include no less than four each by Czanne , Gauguin and Degas , six Rouaults , nine Renoirs , seven Van Goghs , plus outstanding works by Matisse , Picasso , Toulouse-Lautrec , Goya , Delacroix , Corot and El Greco ( see color pages ) . The show represents the utmost in mid-20th century moneyed taste . <P> Shadowy &; Aloof . What catapulted Niarchos overnight into the front ranks of 20th century collectors was his purchase for more than $2,500,000 of 58 paintings and one Degas sculpture from the Edward G. Robinsons ' collection last spring ( the Knoedler show will include 40 of the Robinson paintings ) . But Niarchos did not attain his standing as a collector solely on the strength of the Hollywood actor 's selections . He made his first modest purchase when he picked up Winslow Homer 's A Voice from the Cliffs ( which now hangs in his Manhattan penthouse office ) and a Renoir landscape at a Parke-Bernet auction in Manhattan in 1949 . His first major purchase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid $53,200 at Paris ' famed Cognacq collection sales in 1952 which touched off a boom in Impressionist paintings . He bought his collection 's ' most important single work , El Greco 's Pieta for $400,000 to celebrate New Year 's Eve 1954 . <P> For art dealers , whose livelihood can rest on their ability to size up a new client , his tastes and bank roll , Niarchos has proved to be one of the most enigmatic figures in the art world . Says one of London 's leading dealers , " We all know of Niarchos ; one or two of us have seen him now and then . We all agree that he is one of the world 's more important collectors . But he 's shadowy and aloof in the gallery realm . He remains behind the scenes . "
