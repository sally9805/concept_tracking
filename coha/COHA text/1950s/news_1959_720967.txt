txt The Cuban economy is beginning to experience the shock of transition from the system ofl free enterprise to what may timately become one of total state control . That appears to be the goal ' of the extremist group of Cuban revolutionary planners who now wield complete power  --  a striking outcome of the overthrow of the Batista regime last New Year 's Day . The most powerful figure among the planners appears to be Maj. Ernesto Guevara , 30-year-old Argentine-born physician , amateur economist and one of the most Leftist Members of the Castro regime . Spearheading Cuba 's transformation is land reform , which , in the opinion of some experts here , is being pushed ahead without adequate planning and frequently in violation of the law that promulgated it . Speed in the seizure of land seems to be all that matters at this stage , regardless of its effect on production , Private land holdings are being replaced for the most part by Governmentsponsored cooperatives . But the state has also turned ) its attention to industry and // other private business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from continuing a search for oil on which they have spent $30,000,000 . A new mining law may make it unprofitable for Cuban and foreign companies to go on , despite an investment exceeding $200,000 , - 000 . Orders to slash utility rates have paralyzed that industry 's expansion plans , and may make them ripe for nationalization , for which there is growing public agitation . The Cuban Telephone Company Is already operated by the Government under a system of " intervention , " or trusteeship . There is a strong possibility that charters of private banks , especially foreign ones , will be canceled . As the shift toward statism gathers speed , the organization emerging as the fountainhead of economic planning and controls is the National Institute of Agrarian Reform . It has become the nation 's largest land and cattle owner ; it is penetrating many other activities , and now looms as a superstate . The institute plans to spend $160,000,000 in 1960 . It has spent $70,000,000 this year . The land reform law provided that the army was to support the operation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It , is run by army officers ( Pre ' mier Fidel Castro is its president and devotes a great deal of time to it ) and its headquarters in downtown Havana are guarded by troops like a fortress . Guevara 's Power Grows Major Guevara was named head of the industrial department of the institute on his return two months ago from a world tour . He quickly became one of the chief economic influences in the Government . On Nov. 26 , in a surprise move , Premier Castro named him president of the National Bank , a position from which Major Guevara can run Cuba 's finances and try to make them fit into his over-all plans for state capitalism . The appointment made him the nearest ; thing to Cuba 's economic czar and removed any doubt as to the trend of the revolution . Qne of his first steps in the National Bank was a drastic new tightening of currency regulations to protect declining dollar reserves . In the field of agriculture , the institute has already carried out " intervention " over hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other land . Intervention is the preliminary process under which the institute takes over land in preparation for actual expropriation proceedings . In scores of instances , the seized lands have been made into cooperatives  --  the law says that this should be done whenever practicable  --  and in others , the farms operate as they did before under the institute 's supervision , Although the law also provides that each peasant family is entitled to 66.6 acres as a " vital minimum , " almost no land has been distributed in that manner . Instead of working for a landlord , the peasant now works for the institute cooperative , usually at lower wages than before , but with the promise of participating in the profits later . When it began its operations , the institute indicated that its first object would be to seize idle lands to increase Cuba 's agricultural production . Productive lands would be seized later . In practice , however , the institute did precisely the opposite . Areas of high production were taken over first , especially prosperous cattle ranches in Camaguey , Oriente @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the institute took over the most famous tobacco farm in Pinar del Rio Province . Cattle Stampede The law provides that cattle ranchers may retain up to 3,330 acres each , but the policy has been to limit these holdings to 1,650 acres . To protests the in .. ; titute 's military delegates have replied . " We are the law . " By limiting acreage , the institute has been able to purchase at prices below the market cattle that the owners could " not . maintain . In other cases cattle have been simply seized , although the law makes no provision for compensation . Special bonds may be issued for the purpose some day . In Camaguey alone the institute has purchased more than $5,000,000 worth of cattle for cash . Shifting cattle from pasture to pasture , erring in classification through the inexperience of administrators , slaughtering breeding stock for exports and engaging in other actions that make cattlemen shudder , the institute is said by critics to have set the cattle industry back five years . As it went along , the institute began establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and taking over slaughterhouses in neighboring towns . In all , there are 440 consumer cooperatives . In Oriente , the institute became the sole buyer of coffee ; in the central and western provinces it took over trade in potatoes , tomatoes and eggs . Late in November , potatoes disappeared from most cities . Along the coast the institute seized fishing boats to organize fishermen 's cooperatives . Its next major step will be the take-over of sugar lands , Cuba 's principal wealth . All indications are that this will await the end of the 1960 harvest , around April . From his post at the National Bank , Major Guevara has seized control of the Cuban Institute of Sugar Stabilization . The belief in the trade is that , in time , the institute will also nationalize the sugar- mills , and follow by taking over sugar exporting . At present , the institute operates nine of Cuba 's 161 sugar mills . They were confiscated as the property of " war criminals . " Contemplating the activities and plans of the land reform agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it and have money to spare for industrial development and public works . The land reform alone , with compensation to be paid in 4% per cent , twenty-year bonds , will heavily mortgage Cuba 's economy unless the bonds are defaulted . Thus far , they have not even been printed , nor have valuations of seized land been made . The nationalization of utilities , if it comes , will add to the burden . In addition , the law provides that the institute must buy farm machinery to service the cooperatives , and must engage in a long list of social improvements in the rural areas . The Government also hopes to drain the Cienaga de Zapatas , a huge swamp on the south coast , to turn it into Cuba 's rice bowl . To this end , it says , it has obtained $100,000,000 in credits for equipment from European sources . But by discouraging private enterprise , the Government has already increased the chronically high ranks of the unemployed , and is eliminating sources of tax revenue . The 1959 budget is expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it ' is unlikely that the regime , with all its new plans and responsibilities , will be able to balance a 1960 budget that is to be $100,000 , - 000 larger than the current one . Hence , Dr. Castro has persuaded labor to deduct 4 per cent of its pay next year for industrialization , and to donate extra days of work . A campaign is under way to help finance agrarian reform , new industry , the purchase of weapons abroad and other undertakings through voluntary donations and purchases of special bonds . It all adds up to indirect taxation and , economists say , more of it must come soon . They suggest that the choice facing Cuba is to impose a growing austerity to pay for the state economy ? as the Soviet Union and Red China have done  --  or to turn to the printing press and plunge the nation into an inflationary spiral . " There is no limit to taxation , " a Cuban financial expert commented , " but there may be a limit to the people 's willingness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - fledged police state here . " The fate of the Cuban revolution , and of Dr. Fidel Castro , may hinge upon these choices Tomorrow : U. S.-Cuban relations are poor .
