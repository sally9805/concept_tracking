 | In Hollywood , where " Here today and one tomorrow " is practically the civic motto and where hundreds of people have undergone a kind of reverse Horatio Alger experience by going to bed famous and waking up to find themselves unknown . Loretta Young is the town 's chief example of how to get to the top fast and stay there for keeps . She has been in the movies thirty-eight years . having started shortly after she learned how to walk . and has made over eighty films . far more than any other leading lady . Asked recently whether she had a favorite leading man among those she had worked with , she said , " Oh , yes , " and named fifty-seven . from Richard Barthelmess to Bob Cummings . a performance that displayed two of her chief qualities , her tact and her memory . She played ( at four ) with such greats of long ago as Fanny Ward and Theodore Roberts . At fourteen she was Lon Chaney 's leading lady . More recently she has appeared opposite such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gable , Alan Ladd , David Niven , Cary Grant , Robert Taylor , Jeff Chandler . Robert Mitchum . Van Johnson , William Holden , and almost anybody else you might care to name . This bit of brown-haired fluff with the blue eyes , the wide , generous smile , and the nothing waist has , in Hollywood terms , outlasted the generations . When , in 1948 , she won an Academy Award for her performance as Katie , the Swedish housemaid , in The Farmer 's Daughter , she walked up to the platform when her name was called , glanced at the gold statuette , turned her great blue eyes to the audience . and said laughingly , " At long last . " The audience smiled with her , and then , suddenly . all over the house , people began to cry . It was as if , in this town in which the  | sense of the brevity of life and of happiness is as sharp as in the Foreign Legion , there had at that moment flared a realization of just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who grew up in a Los Angeles boardinghouse. to fight her way into that small group of film-town nobility who are able to order time to stand still . The veteran over whom they were weeping was , at the moment , all of thirty-five . To last as Loretta Young has lasted one must , as the cliche says , know the answers . In reality it 's harder than that : One must know what the problems are The average lovely lady who comes to Hollywood does n't stay long enough to find out . Usually the beautiful girl who has caught a director 's eye in some smalltown restaurant is brought to Hollywood as an ingenue . An ingenue is a delectable bit of femininity who hangs around throughout a film and is awarded to one of the male characters in the last reel as a prize for his having put out the forest fire or beat up the bad guys . She needs only two speeds : a pout and a smile . If she remains an ingenue . she will appear in five or six films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and settle in the Valley . Above the ingenue is the leading lady . You can tell the leading lady in a film by the fact that she marries the leading man . Their film story is a romance in which they are of theoretically equal importance . The leading lady needs more resources than the ingenue , a bit of comedy sense , a touch of pathos , the ability to look as if her emotions have been stirred and not merely as if the director has frightened her . But if she remains only a leading lady , she will slowly lose consequence and will end up as a foil for male actors more important than she is . THE next higher rank is the mature and polished actress who can carry a story that is built entirely around her . Such a story was The Farmer 's Daughter , in which Loretta played a housemaid , complete with Swedish accent , who charmed one and all by her candor , good sense , and honesty , and ultimately ran for Congress and was elected . This is symphony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the acting orchestra , including , especially , the ability to make the audience believe you are what you are pretending to be . Established Hollywood people are often a little afraid of doing what they have never done before , for fear of upsetting the magic . When Dore Schary , producer of The Farmer 's Daughter , suggested the role of Katie to Loretta , she said , " You mean you want me to play it with a Swedish accent and a blond wig and all ? Is n't that different and dangerous for me ? " " That 's right , " said Schary cheerfully . " You could be the worst you 've ever been in your whole life . But if you 're right in it , you 'll win the Academy Award . " " That does it , " said Loretta . " I 'll take your challenge . " When Schary , during production , saw the " dailies " ? film strips developed after each day 's work ? he called Loretta and said , " Baby , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you mean it ? " asked Loretta doubtfully . " I do . " Nobody except Schary expected Loretta to win . She refused to prepare a speech the night of the presentations . She acquired a new dress for the evening , but since she acquires a new dress for every public appearance , believing this to be her simple duty to people who expect to see her well-turned-out , this was no great concession . That was why she was stuck with " At long last " and made sudden tears sting the eyes of the audience . Then she did what few Oscar recipients had ever done before . She spoke simply and movingly about the other leading actresses of the year , and their roles , and why they should have been given the little golden figure . ABOVE the " polished , mature actress " rank , there is only one place to go : That is to do " great lady " roles , i.e. , to be Queen Victoria on the screen , or to make like Ethel Barrymore . Loretta ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still too young and beautiful . There is no one in Hollywood , however , who doubts that , perhaps after a long enough adventure in television , Loretta will return as the great lady of the screen . ( She is currently appearing in The Loretta Young Show , produced by her husband , Tom Lewis , which , with thirty-nine separate television stories to film each year , meaning thirty-nine wardrobes to get up and thirty-nine parts to learn , leaves her no time for the movies . ) One producer , for whom she has made brilliantly successful pictures , became so wrapped up in talking about Loretta 's future that he exclaimed , " Give her ten more years to develop and there 'll be no holding her ! " ? as charming a compliment as has perhaps ever been paid to a great star over forty . ( Loretta horrifies her associates by adding a year to her age , in conversation , as soon as she hits a birthday ; on her thirty-fifth birthday she began speaking of herself as thirtysix , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many times that this is n't the best . procedure , but she does n't seem able to understand what the excitement is about . ) As to why one pretty little girl , breaking into films , can size up her problems and find the answers , and another ca n't , there is no telling . Loretta has always been able to do it . When she became a leading lady at fourteen ( returning to the movies after having been a child player at four ) she found her scripts quite often required that she look at her current leading man yearningly , with an intense air of devotion . The halfgrown girl solved the problem by lowering her eyelids and pretending that the leading man , whatever his name , was a dish of vanilla ice cream . This , she found , gave her exactly the right expression of high-powered love . " That 's Loretta , " said a producer . " She always finds the way . Take clothes . She 'll be cast , say , as a stenographer , a girl making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she 'll spend days finding the right clothes . You take some pretty little doll around the studios and cast her in a part like that and she 'll want the best clothes in the world , dresses costing four , five , six hundred dollars a copy . She wo n't care that a stenographer could never afford clothes like that ; she wants to kill the audience with her  | dresses . Not Loretta . She 'll stand on that stool in wardrobe and try on and try on until she finds clothes that a stenographer could afford but that have that extra little something about them to make them beautiful . She looks so frail and outworks us all . It 's hard on all of us. this perfectionism of hers . But it 's what makes her a pro . " Take hair . In The Story of Alexander Graham Bell , which Loretta made with Don Ameche , all three of her sisters appeared with her , in a family reunion . All are actresses , all are older than she ' ( all are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , achieved fame as Sally Blane ; while the others , Georgianna and Polly Ann . also hit the films before Loretta . On the Bell set one of her sisters asked Loretta how she liked her hair . Loretta did n't . " Why did you let the hairdresser do you like that ? " demanded Loretta . " He said it was right for the period . " " You always have to be a little different from what the hairdresser wants . " said Loretta , " or you 're going to be just average . That 's true for any period . If you do n't know more than a hairdresser , you do n't deserve to have a hairdresser . " Loretta knows hair as she knows clothes and always does her own . : watched her put the finishing touches on her brown hair for a pickpocket role on the television set at the Goldwyn studio . " This one 's easy , " she said . " Just something cheap up here and the rest dead hair . " SHE was born Gretchen Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or . Hollywood Avenue , believe it or not , in Salt Lake City . Her father disappeared while she was an infant . Her mother . a dauntless and remarkable woman , took what must have been the handsomest set of small girls in America to Los Angeles and started a boardinghouse . Through an uncle who had a studio connectior .. Gretchen was put to work at four i-. a film , The Only Way , with the ageless Fanny Ward and Theodore Roberts . Laid out on an operating table in one scene and instructed to cry , she put her heart into it in what was to become the typical Loretta Young way : She shrieked so that people came running from all parts of the studio , sure disaster had struck . After a stretch of child acting , she was entered in a Los Angeles parochial school and later in Ramona Convent . She remembers when her family was so poor she had to go to school without socks Her sisters appeared in films from time to time while she attended classes . The studios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is completely a Hollywood product , which may account for her matter-of-fact and businesslike approach to her work . Hollywood is her " country " ; it has never been a remote Glamorville to her , and she still views with astonishment the pretentious antics of later beauties who arrived on superduper trains and planes to put their dainty feet on the unrolled red carpet She walked these streets in torn shoes and knows them in a different way ; until she was quite famous she had never beer . east of Salt Lake City . She was thirteer. when Mervyn LeRoy phoned the house one day to offer a role to her sister , Polly Ann , who was at the moment on location on another job . " Wo n't I do ? " asked Gretchen . She was put into Naughty But Nice .  | with Colleen Moore , who was enchanted with her , gave her her film name , Loretta , took her to First National 's head office , and declaimed , in the throbbing Colleen Moore way , " You must place this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . At fourteen Loretta was offered a part in Laugh , Clown , Laugh with Lon Chaney . Herbert Brenon , one of the great , and greatly feared , directors of the day , explained that she would have to wear a ballet skirt , for the part called for a tightrope walker with beautiful legs . " Good-by , " said Loretta . " Mine are like sticks . " ( Loretta Young is the only known critic of Loretta Young 's legs , which she considers too thin ; nobody else has ever complained . ) Brenon stopped her . " It 's those eyes of yours I need , " he said . " They 're irreplaceable . " She really grew up as a film player working with Brenon . This director , as implacable a perfectionist as herself , would storm at her and humiliate her before the company , reducing the young girl to helpless tears . There is a Hollywood legend that , carried away in one scene , Brenon let Loretta run out on the tightrope instead of using a double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . Brenon , the story goes , picked her up and held her in his arms , saying , " My poor baby ! What have I done to you ? " Once she was sitting on the floor in a corner of the set , crying , when Lon Chaney came upon her . The great old pro sat down with the girl , trying to comfort her . " Nothing like this is worth breaking one 's heart over , " he said . " Sincere work will win . Tears wo n't change it , one way or another . " She stopped crying . She has n't cried over her work since . The amount of work she has done ? nobody in Hollywood doubts that it is sincere ? is prodigious . ( Actors , struggling to learn their lines , tell in an awed way how Loretta , when memorizing a part , does n't stop with learning her own speeches ; she memorizes everybody 's lines , to understand her own role better . ) In over eighty films she has thus committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shelf . LORETTA had just about won her child stardom when the talkies came and " sound panic " struck Hollywood . Though she had never seen a professional legitimate play , she promptly won an award for having the best diction of female players in the films . ( Her sisters helped keep her from getting a swelled head by sticking crooked gold stars over her furniture and bowing whenever she entered a room . ) She splurged by buying a " Venetian " bedroom set for her own room , which she remembers as an excruciating horror . Her mother tactfully let her keep it for six months before sending it away . Through her mother ( who , today , as Mrs. Gladys Royal Belzer , is one of Hollywood 's better interior decorators ) , Loretta made the discovery that antique furniture goes up in value while other furniture goes down . To Loretta 's cool business mind this has ever since seemed an extraordinarily interesting fact . She and her mother furnished a house with antiques and found it was so greatly admired that they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process . By the time Loretta married Tom Lewis in 1940 she owned thirteen such houses .  | During this period she made as many as nine pictures a year . In 1933 she appeared in Zoo in Budapest , with Gene Raymond , a tender fantasy of young love among the caged animals . It became one of the small number of " classic " movies ; cinema connoisseurs still like to have it unreeled for them from time to time . Some of Loretta 's typical star pairings were with Spencer Tracy in A Man 's Castle , with Tyrone Power in Love Is News , and with Adolphe Menjou in Cafe Metropole . In 1940 she gave up long-term contracts and became a free lance , selecting pictures as she pleased . She was one of the first big stars to do so . It was considered a risky move by career experts ; tongues clucked all over Hollywood . But being a star is essentially a lonely business . In the end you have to make the big decisions yourself anyway . You 're a slender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who looks as if a strong wind could blow you away , and in the last analysis the whole immense business is up to you ? your clothes , your hair , the cut of your jib , the stories in which you appear . " Sure you can pick a wrong story for yourself , " says Loretta . " So can the studio . " Her immense blue eyes looked over the situation and saw that she might just as well have freedom along with responsibility . " It is a lonely road , being a star , " says Tom Lewis , Loretta 's husband ( a radio executive , who founded the Armed Forces Radio Service during his spell in the Army ) . " Great stars have to be unique . It 's a way of life . It 's even hard for two great stars to be friends . They want to be friends , they try to be , but it 's rough on them . " ONE of Loretta Young 's best friends is Rosalind Russell , also a great star . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Town , the musical comedy in which Roz played to spectacular success in New York . " All during the performance , " says Tom Lewis , Loretta kept clutching my arm and crying and saying , Is n't it smart , the way she 's doing that ? Is n't she wonderful ? ' " After the show Loretta went backstage . The chorus was lined up to meet her . Roz burst into tears , said , " I was awful , " and threw herself into Loretta 's arms . Loretta sobbed , saying over and over , " You were wonderful ! " The average pretty little miss who dreams of what going to Hollywood and becoming a star would mean to her would find ( if her life was anything like Loretta Young 's ) that it meant a great deal of hard work and practically no social life . Loretta makes a film a week for her television show . Over the weekend she learns her scripts , wearing earplugs so her children can play near her while she memorizes . ( She has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the set , Monday and Tuesday . The story is filmed on Wednesday , Thursday , and Friday , so on Tuesday , Wednesday , and Thursday nights she sleeps in her dressing room at the studio , to be ready for a 7 A.M. start . Once or twice a week she goes to sleep at seven in the evening and sleeps through to six in the morning . ( She is determined never to have to take pills , either to wake up or to fall asleep , and takes extremely good care of herself . ) She and Tom Lewis limit their social engagements to little more than one a month . " You have to wear blinders , " says Loretta , " if you want to get any  | work done . " Visitors are mostly barred from the set , and one has a feeling that Loretta Young is hard to get to . The reason turns out to be that she 's a friendly , gabby person who loves to talk to anyone who shows up , with the result that work stops while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no film made . I asked her why she does a weekly television show , requiring so much work , in an age in which leisure is considered one index of success . She supplied an actress ' answer , accurate and to the point . " I really do n't like the story conferences , and picking clothes , and the rest of it , " he said . " I like it when the cameras roll . And in television the cameras roll all the time . " THE stories selected for The Loretta Young Show almost always have an uplift theme . A human problem is presented , and at least one solution is offered . The general feeling in the stories is that people are better than they think they are and can be better still . Loretta is deeply religious , a development that flowered fully in her life shortly before her marriage to Tom Lewis . ( She had been married briefly once before , to Grant Withers , in an elopement at seventeen . ) The entire Lewis family ? father , mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kneeling in the dust before a roadside shrine . The great pictures of Loretta 's free-lance period have almost all had the upbeat note ? for example , The Bishop 's Wife ( in which Cary Grant played an angel ) ; Come to the Stable , in which Loretta impersonated a nun , Sister Margaret Mary , who deals with an assortment of underworld characters while raising funds for a convent ; Mother Was a Freshman ; Half Angel . Something wonderful happens when Loretta puts on a nurse 's cap , as Florence Nightingale , or a nun 's cowl ; the great eyes and the luminous skin produce an ethereal effect that is , even in the stills , oddly moving . Loretta spoke of the Blessed Virgin one afternoon and paid an actress ' tribute : " I think of her , of course , as the most beautiful woman who ever lived . " The words somehow called to mind the famous story of the juggler who paid his respects to the sacred Image by performing before it the simple - kills of his own craft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avorite charity in Los Angeles is St. Anne 's Maternity Hospital for unmarried mothers . She has for years been a familiar of its wards and recreation rooms . She denies that the girls at St. Anne 's are bad . " " They are girls to whom something bad has happened , " she says . Or , as Sister Winifred of St. Anne 's puts it , " We do n't have bad girls here . Bad girls do n't have babies . " Sometimes , however , there are behavior problems ? bitter , disillusioned girls who feel the world has handled them badly . To such as these an unexpected meeting with Loretta Young , who sits on their beds and helps them with their babies , has not only a notable shock value but a decided tonic effect . The institution has made use of her in this way for years . In the end the Loretta Young story is story of expertness , either inborn or somehow achieved , but always there . She 's a dancer and does her own dance sequences when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who will ask a producer to cut down one of her big scenes if it 's what they call in the trade  | " embarrassing " or out of character . She is willing to pay the price for success . which is about the hardest price of all to pay , in the softening atmosphere of adulation . She knows that you ca n't have everything , a truth it is sometimes difficult to break to movie stars . She knows how to make a decision ; she wo n't accept " horseback " or casual opinions from anyone ; she waits until the answer " rings the bell . " She thinks movie stars who come late to the set , or storm off it in fury , should be spanked , and has said so . A most informal person , she never appears on the street in slacks ; she feels she owes it to the business she 's in to look attractive and right , and does so When scheduled to appear at a benefit or a premiere , she buys new clothes forthe occasion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is across the street from her hotel , because she thinks the public gets a kick out of it and wants it , and why should n't they have it ? Studio heads , not used to stars who are grateful for being stars , become dewy-eyed with gratitude to her for carrying the flag for the industry as she does . For the simplest benefit appearance , say a fund-raising speech , she will have research done in the field , will have a careful talk written . will rehearse herself in it , and will then come on and rouse the audience to enthusiasm . She has a sharp eye for things that do n't look right . " Why do some girls wet their lips before acknowledging an introduction ? " she will ask ? " Is n't that odd ? " " She has doubled the length of her career and has now made it permanent , " said a producer who has worked with her , " by being a pro , by making all the transitions in her life so gracefully and knowingly . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still ahead . " She will talk about a garden Cupid she intends to buy for her patio and will suddenly strike a Cupid pose and you can see the statue ? it 's Cupid . Or she will kneel to pick up something , and as she settles gracefully to the floor , she is all of femininity , kneeling . She has , in a long career , done as much work as two men , and is as fresh as a breath of air . You look at her and feel you are seeing something you do n't often see ? a human being completely and joyfully in command of herself .
