t is n't often that a really entertaining new parlor T game comes along . But we think that Two for the Money , a program appearing on radio and television on Tuesday nights , emceed by Herb Shriner , has the makings of a game that might produce some pleasant and spirited competition among guests in your own living room . The rules are simple . Contestants are divided into teams of two people each . If there are eight people , for example , you have four teams . Somebody of course must ask the questions that make up the contest . On the Two for the Money show it 's Herb Shriner . At home it would probably be the host . Here 's how the game starts . The first team is asked three questions . Each question can produce several correct answers . The more correct answers , the higher the score . The first question might be , " Name as many different kinds of candy as you can . " The two members of the team must answer alternately . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other says , " Peanut brittle . " The first then says , " Peppermints . " The other says , " Licorice . " And so on . The team is allowed fifteen seconds for answers to each question , or a total of forty-five seconds for the three questions . On Herb Shriner 's program , each correct answer to the first question is worth five dollars . At home you would merely score points . Thus , if the team got 11 correct answers , its score would be 55 ? 5 points for each correct answer . ( For 6 correct answers the score would be 30 points . And so on . ) The questions get harder Easy ? That 's only the beginning ! Now comes the second question , which should be a little harder , because now each correct answer is worth 55 points ! The question might he , for example , " Name as many words as you can that mean unhappy . " One member of the team perhaps says , " Gloomy . " The other says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The other says , " Sad . " And so on , until 15 seconds are gone . Suppose the team gave seven correct answers to the second question . Its score would be 7 times 55 , or a total of 385 . And to the next and final question each correct answer is worth 385 points ! So naturally the third question is on the tough side . For example , " Name as many national anthems as you can . " When the first team has finished , the next team is asked a new series of questions . Then the next team . And of course the winner is the team that comes up with the highest score . There 's just one rule we have n't mentioned . If either member of a team repeats an answer already given . or gives a wrong answer , the team forfeits the remainder of its time on that question . All the equipment you need to play this game at home is a watch or clock with a second hand , a dictionary and an atlas ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a list of questions . The questions may be slanted to any age or interest group . For a party of teen-agers they can concern band leaders , sports , movie stars , popular songs , the names of colleges , etc . Or you can concentrate on the arts , sciences , politics , or whatever interests your friends most . Next time you 're having the crowd in , why not make it on a Tuesday night ? Spend half an hour listening to or watching the game played professionally , so everyone can get a clear idea of how it works . Then let your guests try it themselves . As a starter we have compiled a list of questions for you . They are based on general rather than specialized knowledge and are slanted equally to men and women . A set of questions to get you started 1 . First question : Name as many kinds of tree as you can .  | Second question : Name as many kinds of specialized doctor as you can .
