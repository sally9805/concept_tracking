When the rocket-powered X2 , the world 's fastest airplane , crashed on the Mojave Desert ( TIME , Oct. 8 ) , it did not plunge to its death unwatched . Trailing behind it through the air were the radio reports of many elaborate instruments . Last week a part of what they reported leaked out of Air Force secrecy . <P> Captain Milburn G. Apt , who flew the X-2 on her last flight , was new at the job . He was an experienced test pilot and familiar with jet aircraft , but he had never handled the X-2 or any other rocket plane . Air experts have wondered why he was not permitted to take it easy the first time and fly the X-2 slowly ( maybe twice the speed of sound ) until he got the feel of her . <P> No such instructions were given . Balding , studious Captain Apt was told to follow an " optimum " flight plan . This meant that if he made no errors and if everything about the X-2 worked perfectly , he would attain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assigned altitude . No one expected him to do as well as that . The chances were as heavily against it as if he had scheduled a record-breaking auto tour from New York to Los Angeles that depended on reaching every traffic light just when it turned green . <P> Unintended Record . Captain Apt was too good and also too lucky . He followed the plan with consummate skill , and he hit every green light . The X-2 made a perfect drop from her mother plane . Her rocket engine ignited at exactly the right moment . Milburn Apt put her into precisely the right climb , and when he reached the assigned " bend-over " altitude ( 70,000 ft. ) , he leveled her off perfectly and let her rip . Nothing whatever went wrong . The rocket engine burned perfectly , and the fuel lasted nine seconds longer than it had ever lasted before . The speed climbed past the X-2 's previous record ( 1,900 m.p.h. ) reached a new record : 2,200 m.p.h. , 3.3 times the speed of sound . <P> When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio : " The engine has cut out and I 'm beginning to turn . " After six seconds of silence he spoke an unintelligible word , almost a shriek . A few minutes later his battered body was found in the cockpit capsule , which had plunged to the desert far below . <P> Bucking Airplane . Air Force authorities say that they know pretty well what happened , but that they can not give much detail without disclosing precious information about the X-2 's behavior and design . The broad facts , however , are that both pilot and ship performed far too well . Captain Apt had been told not to watch his machmeter , the common speed-measuring instrument . His accelerometer , the key speed instrument in this case , could not be read directly in miles per hour . So , when he reached peak speed , he probably did not know how fast he was going . After his engine cut out , he must have slowed down , but when he started to turn , he was still moving at such speed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The X-2 bucked and yawed violently , all at supersonic speed .
