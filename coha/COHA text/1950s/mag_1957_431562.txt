Below the 1,500-foot lookout lay the terraced agriculture of the foothills . Dotted among areas of tea and citronella were tiny red brick structures with gray tile roofs ? shrines where a man might pray for sons or , more often , make an offering to induce a good crop . Beyond the vast terraces the plain began its queenly sweep to the sea . It was golfcourse green and broken into a multitude of geometric forms that defined rice fields ( page 328 ) .

The central room of the dwelling housed a family shrine . Here , amid the Buddhist and Taoist trappings that characterize the religion of most of the islanders , were relics and scrolls recalling a dozen generations of this family . The record ran back to progenitors in China 's Fukien Province , principal source of the vast immigration to Formosa that began 300 years ago .

As Dr. Shen Kung-peh , of the National Taiwan University , put it , " Here on Formosa nearly every family has a little piece of meat each day . Perhaps it 's only a bit of tripe or a duck 's wing for six or seven of them . But in mainland China few can say as much . " Such are the Orient 's standards of abun-dance ! Credit for gains in postwar food production goes in large measure to the Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction .

" In the lowland areas where water , fresh or brackish , is plentiful , I learned that the intensive farming of this industrious island extends even to fish . " Farming fish , " according to T. P. Chen , a scholarly specialist for the Joint Commission , " is much like raising corn or wheat . First the ponds must be prepared by draining , cleaning , and fertilizing . They are " planted " in the spring . Then in the winter the milkfish , carp , and tilapia which make up most of the crop are harvested and sold in fish markets . The crop is nourished with rice bran or soybean and peanut cake . " But the more desirable kinds of carp , " Mr. Chen added , " wo n't breed just anywhere .

" With all the refugees , one of the many things in abundance on Taiwan is labor ; so I asked about the problem of unemployment . " You do n't understand , " the mayor said . We have no unemployment as you mean it . No one starves . There are no beggars . Everyone finds something to do . We just have underemployment . " " What do you mean ? " I pressed .

Or he can set up a streetside stand and sell fruit or vegetables on consignment for a farmer and do about as well . Or he can even become a yellow ox ' ? that is what we call a ticket speculator ? and buy seats at the movies early in the morning and resell them at show time that night at a profit .

I have attended your conference of mayors in New York ; I visited Puerto Rico 's low-cost housing projects and inspected the cities of Europe and talked to their planners . From all I 've seen , I should like to copy Lisbon ; we hope to build a new city on the outskirts and attract the slum dwellers to move . " To see the mayor 's problem firsthand , I arranged to visit some workers ' homes . That of the printer , Li Teh-sui , a skilled compositor of ideographic type , remains vivid in my mind .

Refugees Hope for Factory Jobs The hope of these thousands is for jobs in one of Formosa 's new industries . To see what American aid and Chinese energy have done to industrialize the island , I journeyed north to rainy Chilung . Here in a hill-sheltered harbor , I watched stevedores wrestle boilers and generators , lathes and refinery equipment , all destined for Formosan factories now abuilding . The abundance of labor was brought home as I watched coolies shift boxcars by man power and transport tons of coal , little by little , in baskets swinging on poles ( page 332 ) .

The ability to eradicate malaria has been demonstrated in sample areas and its total elimination is promised . But trachoma and intestinal infections remain problems closely related to congested housing and the use of night soil as fertilizer . " We have a hard time getting performance in the home of what we teach in the schools . " Dr. Kuo You-tseng , a graduate student in public health of the University of Pittsburgh . told me . " It 's all right to say Use a toothbrush , ' but when there 's enough money in a family for only one brush , the benefits disappear . " Tuberculosis is prevalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 4,000 physicians , Dr. Kuo believes that it too can be brought under control . U. S. Assistance Group Instructs Chinese When I arrived in Formosa , signs of military activity greeted me promptly . Planes with military markings landed at Taipei 's riverside field , where all overseas aircraft come in , and the airport lobby swarmed with security police . Hills ringing the harbor at Chilung look down on Chinese and American naval vessels . And the docks beside the tunneled hills were crowded with 105-mm. howitzers , tank-recovery units , cases holding searchlights and generators ? all in the familiar olive drab of Uncle Sam . But beyond these points of entry I had to seek out the military . Eventually I found Chiang 's forces training in the uplands or dug in along the coast . At the Chinese naval base at southerly Tsoying , United States naval personnel ? 364 The National Gec  | members of the Military Assistance Advisory Group ? help their Chinese allies adapt to American vessels , and to learn Western methods of maintenance , supply , and communication. * I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Russian tanker Tuapse as it tried to run fuel oil to Red China . Here a U. S. Navy chief petty officer worked with a Chinese gun crew in the operation of an American 5-incher with which the destroyer ? formerly Japanese ? had been regunned . Near by I visited an LST , our No. 503 , recently renamed Chung Kuang . Chinese troops were aboard , training in embarkation procedures . " Will they abide by our load limits ? " I asked Chief Damage Control Man M. B. Smith . " They wo n't even be able to man her right off , " he said . " They do n't have the skilled crewmen to do it . And once she 's manned , they may have to ignore our load limits . We put 300 to 400 troops aboard an LST . I 've heard they had to take ten times that many aboard in evacuating one of the offshore islands . " Walking through the cavernous hull of the LST , I saw a sight I should have expected after weeks on Taiwan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? a neat row of some fifty bicycles ! Fifteen Minutes from Trouble At Taoyuan airbase I found another element of the United States Military Assistance Program . Here an advisory group , headed by Lt. Col. William H. Beale , Jr .. trains Chinese pilots in the operation of jets . " These guys are good . " the colonel said . " Some of them flew fighters against the Japanese as much as 15 years ago ; then they fought the Communists clear across China . They 're still at it . Our job is to give them everything we know , including assistance in staff work . They have our latest manuals , translated into Chinese , reflecting all we 've learned , even in Korea . " As I walked to wing headquarters past antiaircraft batteries that are manned and alert , and watched combat films of action with Russian-built MIG 's over the mainland the day before , a strange feeling swept over me . " Here I am again , " I felt . " This is World War II ; this is Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighters an American airman guided Chinese mechanics in the repair of a jammed throttle on an F-86 . The plane 's guns were fully armed . " Do you fly around here that way ? " I asked with some surprise . " Sure , " said the colonel . " These fellows are at war . They figure they may have to scramble any time . Remember , we 're only 15 minutes from trouble . " Rice Bowl First Concern of Asians What , one wonders , is the destiny of this island , this overloaded ark with so many more than two of everything aboard , adrift so close to the largest continent ? I asked United States Ambassador Karl L. Rankin if the Chinese Nationalists really believe their slogan , " Return to the Mainland . " If not , what is in store for Formosa ? This matter of returning to the mainland is an article of faith to the Free Chinese . They hammer at it over the radio stations : a couple of dozen semiofficial newspapers editorialize on it ; and every stone-faced roadside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I even glimpsed the slogan on the hazardous cliffside road from Hualien to Suao , where any driver who turned his head long enough to read it risked a plunge hundreds of feet down to the sea . " You must remember , " the Ambassador said , " that the first concern of the people of Asia is the rice bowl . Many are illiterate . To convey an idea to them , you must find a concise expression . Hence Return to the Mainland . ' " The slogan carries a wealth of impressions from Throw the Communists Out ' to Someday We Will Reunite China . ' Nobody is saying just when . And if you were to try to get precise , they might remind you of the plight of Great Britain after Dunkirk . " The problem of Formosa 's destiny is in no way unique , " Ambassador Rankin concluded . " She is akin to South Korea , South Viet Nam , West Germany ? all the divided parts of the world . And like them . Formosa 's future ? communist or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than by the United Nations , and in Washington , London , Moscow , and the capitals of Europe . " *A vital anti-invasion base is the Pescadores island group , between Formosa and the mainland .
