AT THE ripe age of 63 years , rubber conveyor belts will soon be carrying people . Everything from coal to cabbage heads has ridden millions of miles on belts since the world 's first heavy-duty belt was introduced to industry in 1891 . This spring , thousands of New York businessmen who live in New jersey will step aboard a belt twice a day to save their time and energy . It will operate like the 10-mile-long system that carried 12 million tons of aggregate to help build California 's Shasta Dam in 1940 and the five-inch-wide. 25-foot-long ribbon that transports face powder in a cosmetics factory . But it will be called a Speedwalk , and its passengers will be free to stand or walk while riding its 227 feet . The Hudson and Manhattan Railroad , which runs trains to and fro beneath the Hudson River separating New York from New jersey , is installing a Speedwalk . It will connect the platforms where passengers board H &; M trains with the Erie Railroad terminal in Jersey City . This belt will be in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . The Speedwalk is expected almost  | to double the tunnel 's present capacity . The belt , made by Goodyear , will be a 6 1/2-foot-wide strip of thick , three-ply canvas impregnated with a compound of synthetic and natural rubber . It will he driven by a 20-horsepower motor at a speed of 1 1/2 miles per hour . For 127 of the 227 feet that it will extend , it will carry passengers up a 10-percent grade . Handrails will move at the same speed as the belt . Passengers will step on and off as if it were an escalator , and the belt will move in whichever direction the traffic is heavier . Paralleling it will be a walkway for those going in the opposite direction and timid souls who shy away from labor-saving machinery . Belt Would Replace Shuttle This aid to modern commuting is being built by the Stephens-Adamson Mfg . Co. , and installing it will cost about $75 , - 000 . Two more Speedwalks , extending 350 feet farther , may be added later . Both New York City and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar conveyor belts . In New York , a four-blocklong system extending from Times Square to Grand Central Station has been proposed . This would take the place of overcrowded subway trains that now clatter back and forth over a socalled " shuttle " line . And in downtown Cincinnati , a two-way subway belt-conveyor loop has been proposed to uncork bottlenecks in a six-block-long and threeblock-wide area . Venturesome visitors to the Columbian  | Exposition in Chicago rode on a somewhat similar moving platform in 1893 . It was a chain-driven wooden device that " was always getting out of order . " But Thomas Edison had set up a crude belt-conveyor system to carry ore in a New Jersey mine three years previously , which was a forerunner of things to come . One day in the spring of 1891 a 23-year-old , $12-a-week rubber salesman , Thomas Robins , visited the Edison mine . He saw the light canvas conveyor belts with a paper-thin coating of rubber . The rough and bulky iron ore wore them out in a few weeks . Robins Makes Some Tests A tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robins decided that a thicker coating of rubber might do the job . That was a revolutionary suggestion at that time before the rubber automobile tire had been invented ; rubber was valued for its waterproofing qualities rather than for its toughness . Tom Robins experimented with various compounds of rubber . He had 3-inch-thick disks of these made up and  | rigged them at the end of one of Edison 's belts , which he speeded up so that they were struck by a continuous torrent of ore . He added a steel disk for comparison . After subjecting his samples to this grueling test day after day . week after week . he came up with a rubber compound that was hardly worn by the time the steel disk had almost disintegrated . That compound became the covering for the world 's first industrial conveyor belting and was the beginning of a system of continuous mass-materials handling without which today 's big industry would be about helpless . Mountain Is Belted into Puget Sound Belt convenors actually have moved a mountain ? or what seemed a mountain to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the heart of the business district . All traffic had to go around it . For decades it was nibbled at , with dirt carried away in trucks . Finally , the city fathers realized that they were n't getting anywhere and installed a system of belt conveyors that spanned the streets . In about a year . three 3,000-foot conveyors moved 6.000,000 yards of rock and earth to barges that dumped it in Puget Sound . That was in 1928-29 . Shortly after that came the era of big-dam building in this country . Without belt convenors , Grand Coulee . Norris , Shasta . Friant . Anderson Ranch , Hungry Horse and Bull Shoals Dams might never have been built . What is claimed to be the longest overland system is being installed near Rockland , Tex .. to carry lignite . a lowgrade iron ore , four miles from the mine to a power plant of Alcoa . Operated by 950 horsepower , generated by eight motors , it will carry 1.000 tons of ore an hour at a speed of 550 feet a minute . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been the steel-carcass belt , which has steel wire or cable embedded in the rubber-impregnated belting . This development , because of its strength , has made possible the construction of longer single flights ? such as the world 's longest single belt of more than two miles installed in 1949 by Goodyear at the Weirton mine in West Virginia . One of the most ambitious projects for belt conveyors is a two-way elevated system running 103 miles between Lake Eric and an Ohio River terminal . This Riverlake Belt Conveyor is now under consideration by the Ohio state legislature . With 172 belts , or flights , some of them more than a mile long , it could carry 52,000,000 tons a year . transporting iron ore south from the lake and coal north from the river . Will Belts Supplant Highways ? What the belt-conveyor industry has done for materials , it stands ready and eager to do for people . To what extent we will become riders of moving walkways only time will tell . But one writer of science fiction has predicted moving highways for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will use the auto-propulsion of your car only to maneuver on and off a network of fast-moving superthruways  |p105.
