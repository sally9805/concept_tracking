ONE of our subtlest and most pervasive ways of flattering ourselves is to suppose that because we live in modern society we suffer more than our ancestors did . It is a comforting thought , for it pays tribute to our sensitivity at the same time that it tends to excuse our failures , and it gives us a certain historical distinction : better to be specially afflicted than not to be special at all . But whether it is true is another matter . There is some evidence that it is not . Contrary to the almost universal assumption of critics of contemporary society , serious mental disorders apparently are not becoming more frequent . In a fascinating little book published a couple of years ago ( Psychosis and Civilization , Free Press ) Herbert Goldhamer and Andrew Marshall painstakingly examined - the record and reached the conclusion that psychosis was as common a hundred years ago as it is today . Yet whatever else may be in short supply there is always enough suffering to go around , and whether modern man has a bigger share than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make him wonder how it is that the joy life seems to promise should so much of the time elude him . Does his failure to realize that joy arise from sonic defect of his nature , as . theologians have held , or does it arise from some mistake in the framework of society , as reformers have argued ? . In The Sane- Society ( R.inehait , $5 ) Erich Fromm attempts to join the two explanations . As Fromm sees it , man 's suffering comes from his sense of alienation ? his feeling of being cut off , shut out , adrift , fragmentary . Fundamentally man is alienated by his very nature ; when , in the ? course of evolution , he parted company with the lower animals he attained self-consciousness ? including the consciousness that he would die ? andthereby became a candidate for estrangement , boredom , and anxiety . But Fromm is too deeply committed to the tradition of social reform , both of the age of Jefferson and of the age of Marx , to leave the explanation there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villainous social system whose reform would go far toward ameliorating the alienation man now feels . The sane society , Fromm argues , is a society in which the scale is human . Man can relieve his feeling of alienation only by having a sense of the whole , and he can achieve such a sense only by being a member of a group small enough so that he can see where he and his works fit in . Therefore we should reverse the trend toward social gigantism and split up into groups of a hundred families living'and working together on a basis of what Fromm calls humanist communitarian socialism . Fromm 's thesis is much obscured ? and his book made a third again as long as it needs to be ? by the fact that he tries to make an argument between bigness and smallness appear as an argument between capitalism and socialism . Though he is frank to say that where industty has been nationalized in accordance with socialist doctrine there has been neither a reduction in the size of enterprises nor an increase in the meaningfulness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages trying to show that ? nineteenth-tentury socialists merely erred in their emphasis ; essentially they were on the right track . And though the examples of Communitarian living that he cites as models for the rest of us to imitate seem to be purely private ( non-state ) enterprises , he insists on calling their achievements socialism . The result of this intellectual shell game is more than a confusion in terminology . It prevents Fromm from seeing any necessary connection between socialist theory and its more undesirable practical consequences . Moreover , it enables him to believe that modern society makes us more miserable than our forebears were , at the same time he continues to support those whose teachings have helped to shape the institutions of modern society . If what Fromm wishes to advocate is a kind of private or non-state socialism he has not made his position clear . Indeed his attitude toward the state is ambiguous . He is an ardent champion of voluntarism , and his suggestions for the conduct of politics are all grass roots and no grass : yet there are hints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For instance , he envisages state control of advertising drastic enough to keep advertisers from making us want things we do n't have . Even the Almighty has never attempted that . The Sane Society is also marred by the characteristic vice of reformers ? excessive abstraction . Fromm usually speaks of man , very rarely of a man or some men or a few men . His cure for human ills , therefore , very largely has to neglect the diversity that is one of the chief and most endearing characteristics of human beings . Some people are willing to pay the price in loneliness for greater freedom than Fromm 's little communities would permit : others would find all that groupiness intolerable . Some can imagine a whole larger than a hundred families : others would not readily give up the kind of cultural enterprises that large population centers can support , in favor of folk dancing and basket making . The otherwise uninformed reader of Fromin 's book would probably conclude that everyone in the Western world makes his living on an assembly line . But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than a panacea , he is often brilliant in spot diagnosis . Front his wide reading he has assembled and related a great deal of information not readily available elsewhere : his quotations alone form a lively anthology of social criticism . He is penetrating on many subjects of present concern . His discussion 01 laziness as the ideal of the alienated worker is original and important . He convincingly describes depression not as an excess of unpleasant feelings but as an alienation from feeling . He shows that alienation is not the opposite of conformity , as might be supposed , but its cause . The unalienated man , who has a strong sense of who he is and what he is up to in the world , does not need to conform ; conformity 's victim is the estranged individual who has given up trying to be himself or who hopes that his estrangement wilI not he noticed if he looks and acts like everybody else . ACT DALLY anyone who wants to live in a small communist settlement such as Fromm advocates can do so . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States and some of them accept converts . One group that does is the Hutterites , a curious sect something like the Mennonites . They originated in seventeenth-century Moravia and came to America in the 1870s by way of Russia ; now they have nearly a hundred colonies in the Dakotas , Montana , and Southern Canada . They are pacifist religious communists , without private property and with cradle-to-the-grave security . It has been said that they have no mental illness , and this report led a band of social scientists under the leadership of Joseph W. Eaton and Robert J. Weil to make an intensive psychiatric study of the group . The results have recently been published under the title Culture and Mental Disorders ( Free Press , $4 ) , a book that in some respects reads like an extended footnote on Fromm . It turns out that the Hutterites do have mental illness , though probably the incidence is significantly lower than it is for the population as a whole . Mental disease follows a somewhat different pattern ? there is very little schizophrenia ( the illness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the illness of those who feel guilty because they can not measure up ) . Hutterite society does not confuse the individual very much . He knows what is right and what is wrong ; he knows what is expected of him and what he can expect from others . It does not look like a society that could produce much of a civilization ; Eaton and Weil tell of one unusually gifted young woman who in the process of conforming to group expectations became seriously neurotic . The book tends to confirm the position that social conditions play a role in mental illness . However , the authors were unable to make a genetic study of the Hutterites , and principles of selection operating in their history may have something to do with their mental health . Nor do the authors concern themselves very much with the larger social context of the group . The fact is that the Hutterites are living in a period of tremendous boom . They are doubling their population by reproduction every sixteen years ( a record ) ; they live in a region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while the larger society around them poses a threat , it also serves as a reminder of their superiority as chosen vessels of truth . None of these conditions could or should he matched by the total population if it took to communitarian living . YOU HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE BUT YOURSELF F ROM M 'S analysis of conformity is corroborated by Alan Harrington 's satirical novel on the same subject , The Revelations of Dr. Modesto ( Alfred A. Knopf , $3.50 ) . This is the story of an amiable but unremarkable young man who is trying to be himself and making a mess of it . He is alienated all right . He has a job that fills him with loathing , a girl who does nothing in particular to him , and a landlady whose single-minded effort to lead him into temptation only annoys him . The one thing he cares about is making pointless little objects of wood . Then by chance he reads the advertisement Dr. Modesto , who promises and happiness through his system of " centralism " ? which is , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man tries the system with sensational results , but he loses his head : when he forgets that he must be no more successful than other people he ceases to be " central . " In a last desperate effort to get right with centralism he goes in search of its originator , but the great Dr. Modesto , it turns out , is a harmless lunatic who had placed the advertisement in an unguarded moment . Such a story poses serious difficulties for the novelist , for what is there to tell about a man after he becomes just like everybody else ? Harrington solves the problem by relying more and more on fantasy as his story pro:eeds , and since he is a witty and in , entive writer he makes it come off . But the best sections of the book are he least fantastic ? partly because on his topic the best satire is the truth , ! nd partly because Harrington 's gift s really for comedy rather than for atire . The funniest scene in the iovel ? an indelicate encounter beween the landlady and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satirical subject . Yet , much as ur deeper thinkers have worried the ice of conformity in recent public tterances , Harrington has made it to subject of a fresh and highly ent.ta in ing book . WHICH WAY TO FREEDOM ? 3R ESUMABLY all serious novelists are interested in the store of man , but Robert Penn Tarren has frankly made that subct the central concern of his work . his recent long poem , Brother to ragons , he dealt with the place of ' ii in man 's nature ; now in his new wel ? Band of Angels ( Random ouse , $3.95 ) , the August selection the Literary Guild ? he deals with e place of freedom . The key terms his thought are possibility and definition ; to borrow a famous metaphor , he asks whether man 's nature is a well ? a constantly replenished reservoir of possibilities ? or a bucket ? a defined and circumscribed receptacle . He decides in favor of the bucket : man is not free to realize an infinite range of possibilities ; he must recognize his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is self-k n owl edge . Warren has hit upon a superb situation to dramatize this problem . In the Kentucky of a century ago a mulatto girl , indulged and spoiled by her white father , finds herself at his death a slave who must be sold to settle his estate . Before the age of twenty she has experienced the extremes of possibility and definition . The novel follows her for another thirty years or more as she attempts to discover in what sense she is free , but resolution of the intellectual problem does not match in narrative interest the opening section . This may have been inevitable in the situation or it may result from a defect in characterization . Though the book is written from a woman 's point of view , it is not imagined from a woman 's point of view . The rhetoric , for all its resourcefulness and eloquence and apparently effortless abundance , remains the rhetoric of a male author , not of a female character . The very problem that the novel deals with would appeal to a certain kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of woman her story would have been different . Probably she would have ended her career as the headmistress of a training school for emancipated female slaves rather than as she does , the hopeless addict of home-made metaphysics in a Kansas kitchen . YANKEE AND AUSSIE I N Bell 's Landing ( Norton , $3.75 ) Gerald Warner Brace treats a subject similar in its implications to Warren 's . Here the scene is New England and the time the last twenty years . The central character is a young man who must choose between the definition of his Yankee inheritance , represented by a family house called Bell 's Landing , and the possibilities of a freer Bohemian life with a beautiful violinist whose Greek descent makes her representative of the new New England of the immigrant . But the problem never becomes very serious . The young man is a sensible sort of fellow who can be trusted to do the right thing . In contrast with Warren , who uses a romantic rhetoric to support a classical intellectual position , Brace 's very style hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantly elegiac manner is not suitable for drama , or for creating characters under the stress of choice and develop . ment . What Brace can do , perhaps better than any other contemporary American novelist , is to portray old people . He can respect their individuality and catch their peculiar vitality in a way that gives his book a distinction far in excess of the rather conventional narrative framework . The Tree of Man by Patrick White ( Viking , $1.50 ) is a novel about Australia by an Australian . It traces the history of a marriage through the last fifty years , from the time a young man goes into the bush to clear a farm and brings his bride to live in the log cabin he has con ? structed there until the farm is split up into a suburban subdivision and the old man dies . It is a less intellectual novel than either Warren 's or Brace 's , but it too deals with " this necessary slavery , " the conflict be . tween permanence and definition on the one hand and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's characters are simple people . For them life is a mystery through which they move ? occasionally triumphant but usually stumbling ? from the unknown to the unknown , sensing a greater freedom than they know and knowing a limited round of hard work , personal disappointment , and natural disaster . For about the first two hundred pages White writes in an artsycraftsy style that manages to incorporate most of the less winning traits of D. H. Lawrence 's prose , and through . out the book there are brief passage : that do not ring true . But by the end it is a solid achievement . The incidental interest of the Australian set ting has something to do with the book 's success , but it is also on the whole a convincing picture of how people live . whole Constitution matters . It is superior to legislative acts and the Court 's primary function is to preserve that superiority . The Court is not a guardian of justice for the whole people , a permanent committee on moral surveillance ; under the Constitution it has specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain ways in which the Court 's work should be even further narrowed . Rodell ridicules the idea that we have a government of laws not of men ; Jackson is aware that law becomes action only through men but he attaches a higher importance to the laws under which men operate . In certain ways the two books are not commensurate . Rodell 's is a critical history , complete with summaries of fatuous opinions and sketches of leading figures in the Court 's history . The summaries are not always so clear as the breezy style assumes ; the character sketches are vigorous as they are opinionated . On some points Rodell seems a little silly . He gets himself worked up because the Justices make themselves more awesome by wearing robes , but he ought to know that college pro-lessors wear even fancier robes without notoriously intimidating the population . Dissent is Rodell 's hero ? but Jackson , quoting Cardozo , suggests that dissent more often makes for good writing than for good law . Justice Jackson 's much shorter book is composed of three Godkin lectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is analytical rather than historical ; their style is occasionally witty and usually dis-tinguished TEN YEARS ATTER T Ff E Y still write novels about the Second World War . The current Book-of-the-Month-Club selection , Lionel Shapiro 's The Sixth of June ( Doubleday , $3.95 ) , follows the fortunes of a young lieutenant from the summer of 1942 , when he leaves his wife in Connecticut to join the headquarters staff in London , through an interlude in England and an interlude in North Africa , and ends with the Normandy invasion of June 6 , 1944 . The book is slow in getting started , the plot is fairly predictable , and the main characterssome of whom seem to have been in novels you have read before ? invite speculation about which citizens of Hollywood will in time enact them . But much of the detail ( the talk in a pub , scenes on planes and trains and busses , a meal in wartime in an empty country house ) is very well observed and reported . The story is admirably constructed . It builds up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the invasion itself is a fine piece of writing . I N Officers and Gentlemen ( Little , Brown , $3.75 ) Evelyn Waugh completes , he says , the novel about the war he began in Men at Arms , though he adds that he expects to write further books about the same characters . As the story stands it is something of an enigma . The prose is as crisp as ever ; there are fine comic scenes and some excellent minor characters . But the book as a whole has something of the quality of an overextended private joke that nobody will let you in on . One difficulty is that Waugh is fond of using British Army abbreviations not always intelligible to the American reader . Probably the real difficulty is that the book is held together by an attitude toward the army which is never made explicit and which we do not guess because it is rare in modern fiction about war . There are hints that Officers and Gentlemen is another chapter in Waugh 's long love affair with institutionalized irrationality , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so conspicuous in his earlier novels . Those houses are improbable , ridiculous , inconvenient , and too costly , but they have collected around themselves certain emotions and virtues ? love and courage and loyalty ? which give them immense value , and by continuing to offer an opportunity for the expression of those emotions and virtues they serve the human need for grandeur and steadfastness as no rational dwelling could . So it may be that Waugh sees the army as not making sense but as making something better than sense Though puny man may smile at it : patent absurdities and chafe at in apparent injustices , it he is wise ht will prostrate himself before its ac cumulated social power and rejoict in its opportunities for noble action . Such an attitude would ? and in Waugh 's book I. believe it does ? provide a rather different principle of integration From the more usual anti-army attitude . The Navigator by Jules Roy ( Alfred A. Knopf , $3 ) is a novel of the last days in the life of a navigator serving in a French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy 's war is different from the one Shapiro and Waugh write about . They both write primarily social novels ; they see the war in a context of social relations surviving , though under strain , from peacetime . For the navigator the encasement of peacetime has shriveled and fallen away ; his story is the story of the winds that blow across the naked kernel of the essential man , until he at last floats out among the stars and his plane is caught like a ballet dancer in the searchlights over a bombed city and " pierced through and through by the long royal sword of death . " A beautiful brief novel , translated into fine English by Mervyn Savill and handsomely designed by W. A. Dwiggins.
