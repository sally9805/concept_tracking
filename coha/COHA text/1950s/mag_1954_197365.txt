Genoa 's Duilio Marcante is a blond , brawny specialist in diving equipment who spends a lot of time with air tank and rubber flippers below the surface of the Mediterranean . One day Marcante sat on a rock , staring into the clear , green water and thought- as he later recalled : Would n't it be wonderful if there were a statue of Christ down there . Then the dead - all who have lived by the sea and died in it - could have their own secure refuge , a place to pray . " Duilio Marcante told some of his friends , and the idea raced through Genoa and far beyond . Hundreds of Italian athletes sent in bronze and copper trophies to be melted down for the statue . The Italian navy and merchant marine offered bronze scrap from Italian ships sunk in World War II , and from one poor woman came a single copper coin . Sculptor Guido Galletti , 61 , labored for nearly a year to model and cast a figure eight feet tall to stand on a pedestal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the planners decided , was 56 feet below the surface of the bay of San Fruttuoso , between Camogli and Portofmo . There the waters were almost crystal-clear , so that the statue would be visible from above . Many a sea faring man had lost his life there - nearby the Genoese lost a bloody naval battle with the Venetians in 1431 and the British frigate Croesus went down in 1855 . <P> Last week 3,000 people gathered in a flotilla of small boats in the bay of San Fruttuoso . After Mass , the giant statue , its 900-lb. bulk suspended from a naval crane , was lowered into the sea . Slowly the water mounted , inch by inch , until at last it swirled over the suppliant hands . Said a message from Genoa 's Giuseppe Cardinal Siri : " Where men , the pioneers of new roads , are beginning to descend , our Lord and Redeemer descends today . " <P> Duilio Marcante led a group of divers below with floral offerings . He came up white-faced . Said he : " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly breathe and I did n't think I 'd ever manage to get to the bottom with my carnations . Then I saw the statue down there . It was truly moving . I shall never forget it . "
