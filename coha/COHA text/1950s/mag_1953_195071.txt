The village elders of Marsella , 6,300 feet up in Colombia 's Cauca Valley , weighed the arguments and gave consent - yes , it would be a good idea to give the district 's youngsters inoculations against whooping cough and diphtheria . Thereupon , the traveling " sanitary educator , " Roberto Agudelo Valencia , 32 , jumped into his jeep , switched on the public-address system and drove around announcing a movie in the village square . <P> " Of course , " Agudelo says , " people were terrified , since it was the first time they had ever heard a loudspeaker . " But they turned out , 1,500 strong , to see a Walt Disney health film projected on the cleanest whitewashed wall that Agudelo could find . The villagers heard more about the inoculations at Mass : el seor cura read a " spot " announcement written for him by Agudelo , saying the inoculations were a good thing . In school , the teachers said so too . <P> Long Knives . Last week hill farmers ( growers of coffee , sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking their preschool children for inoculations . All wore their Sunday best , the women in bright yellow , green or blue rayon dresses with black shawls , most of them in sneakers instead of sandals , and the men in white capes or ponchos and carrying long , narrow-bladed machetes . <P> Agudelo and Graduate Nurse Maritza Gonzalez , 23 , had set up three inoculation stations around the village , each manned by a vaccinator-a girl who had taken six months of public-health training . Each vaccinator unpacked an alcohol burner from her black bag , sterilized a batch of needles and syringes , and went to work . <P> Many a hill family arrived with five or six children between the ages of six months and seven years . Most had been well washed . " But some were so grimy that we could n't tell the color of the face , " Maritza complained , " and others had had their faces washed but their arms were thick with dirt . Their parents had to listen to a little lecture on cleanliness . " <P> As they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleaded , " Mamita , do n't let her sting me . " But they all got stung , and after a few tears most of them affected an air of childish martyrdom . <P> Back for More . Agudelo 's team , like six others in different parts of Colombia , had worked around the district , giving first inoculations in one place , returning a month and two months later to give the children their second and third shots . One index to the success of Colombia 's campaign is that nearly all the children take the second shot , which is usually enough to confer immunity , and more than two-thirds get the third for extra insurance . <P> Another index is in the disease rates . Whooping cough has been reduced by 90% to 95% in cities where the program was started two years ago , and diphtheria has been cut by 65% to 70% . Nobody knows how many children 's lives have been or can be saved , because Colombia 's vital statistics are too sketchy . But where something like one-sixth of all children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is plenty of room for lifesaving.
