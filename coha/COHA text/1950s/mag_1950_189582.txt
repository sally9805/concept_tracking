Belgium 's royal question became last week a question of the royal word . Exiled King Leopold had agreed , if he were allowed to return to Brussels , to transfer the throne temporarily to his son Prince Baudouin . This was acceptable to anti-Leopoldist Socialists and Liberals , if Leopold would guarantee not to interfere with Baudouin 's regency . Some suggested that the monarch might stay in the Belgian countryside and devote himself to golf ; others proposed the Congo . Then from Switzerland Leopold himself cut in huffily : " It is not necessary that I be asked for guarantees , which can add nothing to the value of my word . " <P> That did it . The Socialists scorned the royal word . The Liberals split bitterly over the issue , while the pro-Leopoldist Christian Socialists ( Catholics ) sneered at them as " suburban Machiavellians . " The Liberals angrily retorted that the Catholics ' Premier-designate Paul van Zeeland was the real Machiavellian-he had meddled with Liberal solidarity . " We are ready to eat the pie , " said Liberal Leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different pastry cook . " <P> But the pie would not bake . Van Zeeland reported a total failure to Regent Prince Charles , advised a new election . The election was scheduled for June 4 . It would be the third vote on the royal question within a year . Sensible Belgians , who were not letting their prolonged constitutional crisis affect their continued economic prosperity , were saying : " The English work for their government , the French work against their government , but we Belgians work despite our government . "
