When Emperor Nero received a shipment of mountain snow for his royal ice cream in a state of slush , he executed the general in charge . When Baltimore Milkman Jacob Fussell first began mass-producing the ancient delicacy in 1851 , he started a U.S. industry that today leads all the world . But though Americans down about 3 billion quarts of ice cream annually , the U.S. Government-unlike Nero-has never had any control over the quality of the industry 's product . Last week the Food and Drug Administration finally issued a code to regulate everything from quality " French " to the " ice milk " sold at roadside stands . <P> Some minimum standards : At least 10% milk fat and 20% milk solids for all ice cream . 2% to 7% milk fat for ice milk , both higher than some current brands . <P> A weight of 4.5 Ibs. per gallon to hold down the amount of air manufacturers whip into their product . A minimum of 1.6 Ibs. of solid substance per gallon to avoid too much water and not enough cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artificially colored products must be clearly labeled . <P> Most important , the new rules clamp down hard on the numerous additives used in mass ice-cream making . FDA approves the continued use of such lump-preventing stabilizers as gelatin , locust-bean gum , sodium alginate , guar-seed gum and extract of Irish peat moss . But it frowns on any further use of alkaline neutralizers , e.g. , baking soda , which some producers use to sweeten up sour milk and cream , make it palatable . Totally banned : certain acid emulsifiers that make ice cream smooth by breaking down the barrier between fat and water . While approving chemicals that occur naturally in food , FDA rejected all synthetic emulsifiers ( monoesters of polyoxyethylene sorbitan , monoesters of polyoxyethylene glycols , etc. ) , which have long since been excluded from salad dressings and bread but are still being used in ice cream . In animal experiments , scientists found that such synthetics have dubious effects , including diarrhea and kidney stones .                 @ @ @ @
