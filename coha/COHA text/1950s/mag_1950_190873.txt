Scottish voters sent a Conservative to Parliament in a by-election last week and gave further evidence that the Labor-Tory deadlock continues with no real swing in sight . In the middle-class Scots-toun district of Glasgow , Colonel James Hutchison , 57-year-old war hero , won by a slim 1,1319-vote margin over his Labor Party opponent . The by-election was caused by the death of Tory Sir Arthur Young , who at last February 's general election had nosed out the Labor candidate by only 239 votes . <P> Scotstoun confirmed the belief of political observers that if a general election were held now the Tories would probably gain slightly ; this would either intensify the parliamentary deadlock by whittling Labor 's present nominal majority of seven still further , or else simply reverse roles by putting the Tories in precarious power .
