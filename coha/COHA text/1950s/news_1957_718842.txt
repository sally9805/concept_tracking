txt to their aid to help them rebuild their town . Here from Washington to survey the situation , Representative A. J. S. Carnahan ( D ) of Missouri plans to suggest to other Fremonts that their donations be handled by the Red Cross which will make sure to give them credit for their help . Miniature ' Hiroshima ' With its splintered trees draped with pieces of corrugated tin roofing and with shattered buildings reduced to heaps on the ground , Fremont looks like a miniature Hiroshima . Only a church and a few other structures have been left standing out of 60 buildings . Six persons have been killed and some 50 injured out of its 200 population . In a first estimate , the Red Cross says that the damage in Carter County including Fremont , Desloge , and Van Buren may total $34000 . This money must come , as far as Red Cross contributions are concerned , through voluntary donations . Additional funds are expected from the federal government 's disaster relief program . " There was a surprising show of spirit right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James E. Bell , retired handyman in a community made up mainly of elderly persons on pensions . " It was the quietest , calmest and most sincere bunch of people you ever saw . No one acted excited . Everyone wanted to help everyone else . It was a display of courage and maturity Fremont can he proud of . " Friends Warned Mr. Bell had heard radio announcements of possible tornadoes on the day of the disaster . He had warned his friends on Main Street several times to watch out when his radio quit talking and began to hum louder and louder without static as it had done previously when tornadoes were in the vicinity . Suddenly at 3:35 p.m. he saw , a black funnel-shaped cloud appear above a hill south of town . He rushed his wife and grandson to the back yard where they dropped flat in a prearranged place on the ground , holding on to some persimmon trees until the wind had passed over . " The wind was full of everything except rain , " Mr. Hill said . " It went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what it brought us from the two stories it knocked off the school on the hill across town . " He pointed to a 12-inch board that had been driven by the wind eight feet into the roadway with four feet of it remaining above the ground . J. C. Burke , lumber-mill operator , stopped in his search through the ruins to say he had found some of his canceled checks " plumb yonder on a hill . " It 's been told with a chuckle by his neighbors that Mr. Burke filled his cellar so full with neighbors that he found he could n't get in himself . Actually he finally got in and dragged a little girl with him but he could n't shut the door . Hcwever , all in the cellar were saved . Robert Huddleston curled up in his sleeping quarters in a junked car to be near his property , pointed to his demolished bachelor home and barn . With all the destruction he said the tornado had n't disturbed his hen with six newly hatched chicks , or his rabbits and goats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her front yard full of broken and twisted trees said : " I prayed when I saw it coming and the tornado jumped clear over my house . " Where Fremont 's voice is most moving is in the little white-frame Methodist Church being used by the Red Cross as a headquarters from which to dispense food and clothing to the needy . The pastor thanks God that school was let out a week before the tornado hit . A woman remarks to a Red Cross worker : " If you can just supply me with a change of clothes and two sheets ? I do n't want too much for I know everyone has been affected . " A man asks for milk for his children but adds that he " does n't want it if someone else needs it more . " Several of the independent townspeople have had to be coaxed to accept food and clothing which they urgently need . None of them want charity . This is the spirit of Fremont : It is a quality that a tornado can emphasize , never squelch . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hammers pounding , can look forward confidently to a new town . It will be a town that attests to the people 's belief in themselves , bolstered by neighbors who did n't forget .
