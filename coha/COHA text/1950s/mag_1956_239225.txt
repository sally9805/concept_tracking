Church and state are separate powers in the Mennonite credo , but the brethren prefer to give the state as wide a berth as possible . Their tightly knit , theocratic little communities assiduously care for their own-and just as assiduously administer their own brand of law . Last week Mennonite law clashed resoundingly with the harsher realities of the law of the land . <P> Udder Trouble . It all began when sandy-haired Adin Hege , 52 , a farmer in the Mennonite community at Maugansville , Md. bought a new cow . Adin discovered that the cow had an inflammation of the udder . He stopped payment on his check . Sued for the amount ( $347 ) , Adin went to court to explain his case . But Mennonite law forbids the brethren to settle disputes in court . Mennonite Bishop Mose 's Horst announced that Adin had been excommunicated . <P> Adin was forthwith " shunned " by the whole sect . Friends stopped talking to him . Neighbors came to visit his wife when he was in the fields , left as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adin finally lit on a group of neighbors and told them to stay away altogether . About this time a nephew decided Adin was showing signs of insanity . He had a talk with Psychologist Jacob Goering at Brook Lane , a Mennonite hospital for mental care . On the basis of the nephew 's description , bolstered by talks with Adin 's wife , Goering decided that Adin was dangerously unbalanced . <P> Flat on the Floor . At 6 o'clock one morning Farmer Hege was getting ready to milk his cows when a group of neighbors approached him for the first time since his excommunication . Before he knew what was happening , four of them had laid him flat on the stone floor before the milk shed . A woman shoved a hypodermic into his left arm . Adin soon lost consciousness , and was driven across the state line to Philhaven , another Mennonite mental hospital in Lebanon , Pa . No outsider might have known anything about it if a passerby had not chanced to see Adin 's brethren loading his limp body into the station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling the district attorney . Authorities established that Adin was missing , and ran him to earth at Philhaven.The hospital agreed to release Adin . Two non-Mennonite doctors examined him and found no reason for his confinement . <P> Last week Psychologist Goering. the nurse who had wielded the needle , and nine of Adin 's neighbors , Mennonites all , were fined a total of $6,000 for assault in a Hagerstown , Md. court . " We have a democracy , and you should subscribe to it , " scolded the judge . But the law of the Mennonite community was still the one Farmer Hege had to deal with , and there he still stood condemned . All Hege need do to return to the fold , said Bishop Horst , was to " confess his error . " Said Adin : " I think I 'll leave it lay right now . "
