There was something special about some of the patients who trooped into the office of elderly Dr. Roy Odell Knapp at the south end of Akron 's Main Street . They were women who did not appear ill , but wore a worried look . Many of them slipped in furtively . The doctor was kindness personified . If , after listening to a woman 's story , he thought it likely that she was pregnant , he would send a urine specimen to City Hospital for a pregnancy test . If the test proved positive , and the patient insisted that her whole life would come crashing down about her if she had a baby , Dr. Knapp performed an abortion . Beginning in 1934 , he did 200 to 300 a year , at $200 apiece-which works out at close to $1,000,000 taken in and 5,500 babies deprived of life . <P> Last week , with sagging jowls and shoulders , Abortionist Knapp sat in Akron 's common pleas court and made a clean breast of it . At first he defended his acts . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among both savage and civilized peoples , and it will always go on , " he said . " I developed a great respect for the women I served . Many are unwed , of good family , and frantic to save their reputations and those of others they hold dear . If they ca n't be cared for under favorable circumstances , they will seek operations from unlicensed practitioners at great danger to their health . " <P> Dr. Knapp testified that in 22 years he had not had a single death . Even the case that blew the roof off his abortion mill was detected while being routinely treated at City Hospital . In his years at the game , Dr. Knapp had never had the slightest trouble with the law or with the medical profession . In fact , he testified , other doctors had referred many cases to him , and the Summit County Medical Society knew about his activities and " had been most kind . " <P> But when Judge Ray Waiters asked : " What is your own attitude toward your conduct ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . " In light of the defendant 's age ( 72 ) and diabetic condition , the court suspended a one-to-seven-year penitentiary sentence but ordered him to serve a purgative four months in the county jail . The county medical society , distinctly not in a " most kind " mood , denied that it had ever had any knowledge of what Dr. Knapp was doing , promptly expelled him .
