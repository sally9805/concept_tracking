MRS . LONGFELLOW ( 255 pp. ) - Edited by Edward Wagenknecht-Longmans , Green ( $5 ) . <P> <P> As a poet , young Henry Wadsworth Longfellow had an eye for beauty . As a man . he had a hankering for beauties . He had married one ( Mary Storer Potter ) in 1831 , but she died four years later while they were traveling in Holland . Only months had passed when , in Switzerland , he met statuesque Fanny Appleton . a proper Bostonian of 19 whose wealth and social position matched her looks and charm . His grief notwithstanding , the young ( 29 ) widower wasted little time . They talked and walked by the Rhine , Longfellow reading poetry aloud as he plodded along behind her . He was not yet the gentle greybeard whom every U.S. child would associate with Hiawatha and spreading chestnut trees , but Harvard had given him a chair of languages and literature and even by exacting standards he might have been called a catch . But it was seven years before Fanny could bring herself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prof. " <P> Mrs. Longfellow , a selection from her letters and journals , gives a few clues to Fanny 's dim view of Longfellow 's suit . For one thing , she already had a more interesting mind than his . She was well read and neither life nor people fooled her . At 19 she could look back uneasily on " childhood , innocence and ignorance , before the down is rubbed off and the skeleton in all things revealed , and that fiend Doubt become our fireside companion . " A bit morbid , perhaps , but still more acute than anything young Henry had yet written . She could also be cattily tart . After seeing Victoria before she became Queen . Fanny set down : " A short , thick , commonplace , stupid-looking girl . . . without even a good complexion . " <P> Critic Into Wife . The fact is that Fanny did not rate Henry very highly as a poet . " The Prof has collected all his vagrant poems into a neat little volume christened mournfully Voices of the Night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mocking-bird than a nightingale . . . " And when he published his next volume : " The Professor has a creamy new volume of verses out . . . the cream of thought being somewhat thinner than that of the binding . " But when , in 1843 , Fanny finally said yes . she loyally ended her role as one of Henry 's sharpest critics . Her letters show that their happiness was nearly total , for whatever Longfellow was as a poet , he was a dedicated husband . <P> Mrs. Longfellow is pre-eminently a woman 's book , and the picture that slowly emerges of a thoroughly charming and civilized lady is one that most contemporary women might well envy . Life with Henry was not exciting , but it had its compensations . ' ' The Prof read and wrote and taught , and as his fame grew the Longfellows entertained most of the famous writers in flowering New England-Hawthorne , Lowell , Emerson . Fanny always saw them plain , just as she had once seen Henry . Emerson 's fame could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , I wonder . . . He is like a ghost to me . I never feel he cares , from his heart , for any human being . " As for James Russell Lowell , she noted that shaving off his beard " takes half the poetry from his face . "
