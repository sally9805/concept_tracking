Canada 's durable and confident Liberal government was in deep political trouble last week , its confidence shaken , its durability in doubt . For the first time since their long term in power began in 1935 , the Liberals were genuinely worried about the outcome of the next election . Practically every major newspaper in the country , Liberal and Tory alike , condemned them . Tory Leader George Drew and CCF ( Socialist ) Leader M. J. Coldwell openly dared them to call an election , and the challenge was weakly declined . Gloom had spread even to the Liberal Cabinet . Said a top Liberal minister : " This could destroy the government . " <P> Arrogant Closure . The issue that shook the Liberals was the government 's measure to advance up to $80 million to the U.S.-controlled Trans-Canada Pipe Lines , Ltd. to build a natural-gas pipeline from Alberta to eastern Canada ( TIME , May 21 ) . Not only was the loan itself unpopular , because of growing Canadian concern about U.S. investors ' control of national resources , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure through Parliament stirred up the entire country . As soon as Trade &; Commerce Minister C. D. Howe introduced it to Parliament , he immediately announced that he would enforce closure of the debate within 48 hours . <P> Cries of " guillotine " and " dictatorship " rang through the chamber as Howe made his closure notice . It meant that all speeches were cut to 20 minutes and that the entire debate on the bill 's first reading would be ruthlessly shut off at 1 o'clock the following morning . With angry arguments over procedure , the opposition managed to prolong the debate until 4:42 a.m. , but in the end the inevitable happened : the massive Liberal majority steamrollered the measure through , 156 to 55 . <P> Forgive and Forget . In the Liberals ' defense , Minister Howe claimed that the Trans-Canada firm , which was organized by Texas Oilman Clint Murchison , was the only one with the necessary pipe and equipment to begin building the long-delayed pipeline this year . Said Howe : " Nothing that can be said in this house can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan be made to a Canadian company and they ridiculed the government for lending tax money to a foreign firm . Said Tory Leader Drew : " Any such proposal before the Congress of the United States would be greeted with laughter that would be heard by the Americans on the D.E.W . line . " <P> But Drew 's and all other opposition objections were overruled . The Liberals now are desperate to get at least a part of the pipeline laid before they are forced to call an election next year . If necessary , they said , they will apply three more closure motions to speed the bill through its final stages , so that the pipelaying can begin this summer . Once the pipeline is in operation , the Liberals hope that the voters will be in a mood to forgive and forget .
