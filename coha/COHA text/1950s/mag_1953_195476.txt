Ninety miles inland from the Persian Gulf , the oasis of Buraimi has slumbered for centuries . Its 8,000 inhabitants subsist on dates , camel meat and milk , and live in eight , mud-walled villages scorched by the gusts of the shamal . No one knows for certain to whom Buraimi belongs . Northward lies Trucial Oman , " protected " by the British ; westward lies Saudi Arabia ; all around is uncharted waste , so desolate that even the Arabs call it Rub al Khali , the Empty Quarter . <P> Over the centuries many marauders have come-the rulers of Oman , of Abu Dhabi , the Unitarians of Nejd ( ancestors of modern Saudi Arabia ) - briefly planted flags , then vanished . In 1869 the Trucial sheiks drove off the last of the Saudi tax collectors . Most conscientious modern geographers simply label Buraimi " undefined . " It is a land of shifting sands , shifting tribes and shifting allegiances . <P> Underground Wants . Forgotten Buraimi is suddenly a land remembered . Reason : oil , seemingly everywhere under the crust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been found within 300 miles . But each side wants to stake its claim . <P> <P> Last August a camel caravan lumbered into Buraimi bearing 40 Saudi officials , clerks and armed men headed by a doughty Arabian named Emir Turki Ibn Utaishan . They started wooing the bewildered inhabitants and chiefs with lavish feasts , silver riyals and sweet talk . Immediately , the Trucial Sheik of Abu Dhabi and the Sultan of Muscat appealed to their " protector " Great Britain to repel the " invaders . " <P> Britain obliged ; a thin red line of British-officered Oman levies marched up and set up camel-hair tents encircling the oasis ; London sent a note demanding Turki 's withdrawal . At this point , Washington , the perennial " third party " in the Middle East , stepped in , negotiated a secret " standstill " agreement . It lasted barely a few months : soon Saudi Arabia denounced Britain 's " provocative actions " and Britain announced " complete freedom of action . " <P> <P> Palmorston Style . Fed up with the past humiliations in Iran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old-fashioned Palmerstonian display of Empire . R.A.F. fighters buzzed up and down the 750-mile-long camel tracks running into Saudi Arabia , searching out reinforcements bound for Turki . Jeep-borne Oman levies roamed everywhere , terrifying camel caravans . From a 40-foot-high Beau Geste-like tower of mud-brick reinforced with palm logs-containing storerooms for food , water and ammunition , and slotted for rifles-a young British major named Peter MacDonald was happily running the show . <P> In Riyadh , old King Ibn Saud , the invalid Lord of the Desert , fumed in his wheelchair . An Arab League official who called on him to discuss burning questions of Israel and Middle East defense could not get him off the subject of perfidious Albion . <P> So far , not a shot has been fired . In bleak , besieged Buraimi , Turki still holds out ; he has 800 bags of rice , enough for many meals . Around him circle a busy band of British . Happiest of all are the local sheiks . They figure that all this excitement means oil . One of them has already decided how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplane.
