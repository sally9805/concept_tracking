Whether they dreamed of it or dreaded it , the statesmen of Western Europe had all come to accept the fact that a new era will dawn on New Year 's Day 1959 , when the long-planned European Common Market finally begins to forge France , West Germany , Italy and the Benelux nations into a single economic unit . Last week , in dramatic preparation for the new era , ten European nations carried out at one fell swoop the most far-reaching international currency reform since World War II . <P> Immediate cause of this coordinated shake-up was a portentous rumor that began to buzz through Europe 's chancelleries as 1958 waned . To celebrate the inauguration of the Common Market , so the story ran , West Germany planned to make the Deutsche Mark freely convertible currency-a move that might well transfer the banking capital of Europe from London to Bonn . <P> Brooding over this unsettling report , British Chancellor of the Exchequer Derick Heathcoat Amory two weeks ago took advantage of a routine Paris meeting of the Organization for European Economic Cooperation to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erhard and French Finance Minister Antoine Pinay . The fruits of that chat were harvested late last week , when the British treasury laconically announced that it had decided to make the pound sterling " externally convertible . " <P> Since British subjects will still be rigidly limited in the amount of sterling they can convert into hard currencies , the British action falls short of true convertibility . But henceforth , foreign businessmen will be able to change pounds freely into dollars ( at an official rate ranging between $2.78 and $2.82 ) . The result , so London hoped , would be to maintain the pound 's position as Europe 's leading medium of exchange-a vital matter to the British , who. with only 4% of the world 's money , do 40% of the world 's banking . <P> Given this go-ahead from the world 's top trading nation , other European nations followed suit . In rapid succession , West Germany , Italy , the Scandinavian countries and the Benelux nations all proclaimed their currencies externally convertible . ( Denmark , responding to the drama of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even before the British treasury set the example . ) <P> The Squeeze . All this , despite the fact that Britain has long been contemplating external convertibility , had the effect of putting a painful squeeze on France . Yet Pinay had not opposed the British and Germans ; in fact , it was he who proposed advancing the date to Dec. 27 . With the franc officially valued at 420 to the dollar but selling in the free market for 470 or worse , General de Gaulle 's government was already faced with one harsh fact : unless the official value of the franc were brought into line with its true value , French products would be too highpriced to compete freely-as they must within the six-nation Common Market-against those of Germany , Italy and Benelux . Now , in addition to devaluing the franc , France had also to make it convertible-or else face a capital flight away from the franc to the convertible pound or Deutsche Mark . Unlike Britain , whose gold and dollar reserves are at a seven-year high , France is running a $60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
