When Gian-Carlo Menotti was a child , at home near Milan , he was crippled in one leg . A devout nurse took him to a shrine of the Madonna , and shortly afterwards he was cured . He still believes that his cure could have been miraculous . But at the same time , Composer Menotti also believes that he does not believe : he admits to skepticism and has left the Roman Catholic Church . This contradiction has turned up in Menotti operas before ( e.g. , The Medium ) , in the shape of dramatic conflicts between some form of faith and reason . The theme is rousingly treated in Menotti 's new opera , The Saint of Bleecker Street , which last week opened on Broadway to rave reviews . It is Menotti 's most ambitious opera to date , and perhaps his best . <P> As his own librettist , Menotti sets the scene in New York 's Little Italy , and superimposes the sometimes gay , sometimes squalid American lives of its citizens on their Old World traditions . This time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the young and sickly " saint " who has visions of the Crucifixion and shows the holy stigmata on Good Fridays , and her rebellious brother Michele , who thinks religion is fanaticism . Annina yearns to become a nun , but Michele thinks her visions are delusions and tries to prevent her from taking the veil . <P> Tongue-Lashing Aria . Menotti is a master melodist and an excellent hand at concocting workable dramatic episodes . Moment by moment , he has his audience believing in his action , even if it is laden with stereotypes . Each of his five scenes works to a strong , stirring climax . Michele drives the gawking neighbors out of his cold-water flat after Annina 's vision . During a religious parade , he is beaten and shackled to a steel fence in symbolic martyrdom . He stabs his mistress after she accuses him of incestuous love for Annina . In a bleak subway station , he curses Annina when she insists on taking the veil . And finally Annina becomes the bride of Christ in a chilling ritual . <P> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operas , such as The Consul , and created a full-scale Italian-style opera , used a large chorus and a 56-piece orchestra ( he worked on it for a year , on a grant from the Rockefeller Foundation ) . In preparation , Menotti made two afternoon field trips to Manhattan 's Mulberry Street to get the flavor of his subject . He writes with absolute conviction in an idiom that was new when Puccini was young . His strings sing with silken suavity behind tender scenes , but brasses and percussion can also rasp and grump disturbingly . Tenor David Poleri ( Michele ) has a tongue-lashing , show-stopping aria ( " . . . You are ashamed to say : ' I was Italian ' " ) , and Soprano Gloria Lane* as his mistress has another ( " . . . <P> What does she ever do for you , except light candles for your soul ? " ) . Virginia Copeland , steadily dramatic as Annina . <P> sings moving , melodious recitatives . Other standouts : some impressive liturgical choruses , a bawling jukebox sequence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an improvisatory manner .
