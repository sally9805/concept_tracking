Puerto Rico-once a U.S. poorhouse in the Caribbean and lately a busy island workshop-is turning into a chic winter resort . Next week . 20 miles from downtown San Juan , Laurance Rockefeller 's $9,000,000 Dorado Beach will open its doors , outclassing the smartest resorts of Jamaica . Antigua and Barbados . <P> Dorado Beach has 136 rooms in nine two-story beach houses . Rooms start at $45 daily , sleeping cabanas at $35 . Guests get breakfast , dinner , two miles of reef and beach , 1,250 acres planted largely to flowers and specimen trees , three cork-topped tennis courts . They also get an 18-hole golf course designed by Robert Trent Jones and supervised by Ed Dudley , formerly President Eisenhower 's pro at the Augusta National . Surfaced in a fine-strained Bermuda grass , the course winds along 7,110 yards of lake , coconut grove , ocean , ends at a Spanish-colonial mansion remodeled into a clubhouse . It goes into use Dec. 4 with a $35,000 invitational tourney for some 30 top pros . <P> A week later , a second new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Seashell ) on the San Juan beachfront . With a casino , eight restaurants and cocktail lounges , a sea-shell-shaped nightclub set by surf 's edge . La Concha is aimed to please the crowd bored with Miami and scared of going to Havana because of the Cuban rebellion . The Puerto Rican government built the hotel for $6,000,000. leased it for two-thirds of the net to Associated Federal Hotels , a Southwestern chain ( Phoenix 's Westward Ho , San Antonio 's Gunter ) , which spent another $1,200,000 on furnishings . ( A similar deal for San Juan 's Caribe Hilton , which has been a consistent moneymaker , will net the government about $1,500,000 this year . ) <P> Other big hotels are in prospect . In <P> Manhattan last week the Sheraton chain ( 48 hotels ) contracted to operate a 450-room hotel that , at 18 stories , will become the island 's tallest building .

In eleven years tourism has jumped sixfold to become Puerto Rico 's third industry , with a $31 million annual volume - more than the tourist trade of all the South American countries combined . <P> An important drawing card is the biggest airline-fare bargain in the world . For the $90 economy round-trip fare , the tourist can go from Manhattan to San Juan and return-a total of 3,200 miles at a cost of 2.8 per mile v. 2.9 per mile for an average Manhattan subway ride . The cheap fare , aimed originally at migrating Puerto Ricans. now attracts an estimated 60,000 tourists a year .
