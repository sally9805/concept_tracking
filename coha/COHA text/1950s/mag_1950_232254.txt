It was all very well to talk , as many educators did , about doubling U.S. college enrollments by 1960 . But was it really a good idea ? Last week Harvard President James Bryant Conant said he had a better one : a lot more two-year colleges . <P> " Equality of opportunity , " said Conant , " is one of the cardinal principles of this country . . . Yet at the same time , no young man or woman should be encouraged or enticed into taking the kinds of advanced educational training which are going to lead to a frustrated economic life . " <P> With doubled enrollment , he thought , the four-year colleges and universities would turn out so many highly trained specialists that only a fraction of them would ever find jobs or be satisfied with the ones they did find .
