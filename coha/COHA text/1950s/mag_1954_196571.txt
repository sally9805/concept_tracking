DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER is the most photographed and best reported man in the world , yet the stranger who sees him for the first time is inevitably surprised at what he sees . Partly this is true because newspaper readers and TV viewers think of Ike in black &; white photographs , where his bland coloring makes for a washed-out picture . ( Before he makes his TV broadcasts , the makeup men have to pencil in hairline and eyebrows . ) But in full color Ike Eisenhower emerges as a warm study of a man of 63 years , ruddy of complexion from the jaw to the top of his broad , bald head , with the ruddiness contrasted by blue eyes , blond-whitish eyebrows and thin wisps of greying blond hair . The pictures on the following pages were taken at the White House and in Augusta , Ga. , during the period when the President was working on his State of the Union message . They show that Ike is , facially and bodily , a man in motion . <P> Irrespective of their actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ike moves young . It is noticeable in the spring of his walk as he enters a room . It is ' noticeable in the flash-like speed in which he moves from sitting to striding in the middle of an interview . It is noticeable in a meeting when , with youthful effortlessness , he swings from a low slouch ( pressure on third lumbar ) to bolt upright . <P> The only time Ike seems to sag is when he is bored . When he is interested , his eyes sparkle and his mobile mouth twists to a hundred shadings of response-grins of varying intensity if he approves what he hears , a shallow 5 in disbelief , a wry turndown at the corners if he is disgusted . When the going is heavy he concentrates as he listens , sometimes fiddling absently with a cap on a front tooth with thumb and forefinger . Sometimes he picks up his heavy-rimmed spectacles and twirls them or chews the stems . Or he will play with the top of his right ear , then drop his hands to the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread ) . <P> Then Ike is out of his chair , ready with an answer . He paces the deep-piled green carpet , stopping occasionally to cock his head at the ceiling to get a grasp on his thoughts . As he talks , he comes back to his desk , stands at an easy parade rest , plunging one hand into a pocket , or crossing and uncrossing his arms . His gestures have no oratorical flair , and betray no nervousness . Ike does not squirm or fidget . He moves smoothly , as an athlete moves . <P> If he is dictating he likes to sit on the edge of the desk and swing a putter or a nine iron . Or sometimes he slips a specially designed 5-lb. weight over the toe of his left shoe , and swings the leg back &; forth to exercise the knee which he injured during his West Point football career . <P> If he is speaking to a small group , he may stab the air with an emphatic forefinger ( above ) . Or , as he makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one fist , held so close to his side as almost to escape notice . But his expressive face does most of his gesturing for him ; people rarely misunderstand Ike in a face-to-face conversation , even though , in cold transcript , his sentences sometimes balloon into syntactical confusion .
