CALIFORNIA A Nice Point of Law The police of Long Beach , Calif , had no doubt that Arta Christiansen died by her own hand . After threatening suicide at least half a dozen times during her one year of married life with House Painter Oswald Christiansen , she spent the evening at a bar , then went home and took a .22 rifle out of a closet . She asked Oswald to load the gun for her , and he promptly did so . She told him what she was going to do . " You have n't got the guts , " he said . Then &; there , she proved him wrong . <P> After Arta 's funeral last week , cops arrested Christiansen under a state law that makes it a felony to abet a suicide . But a California court had declared such a law unconstitutional . There is no California law against suicide itself . Asked Deputy District Attorney Ted C. Sten : " How can a person be guilty of a felony as the result of aiding and abetting a deed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sten 's order , the police let Christiansen go , a free man .
