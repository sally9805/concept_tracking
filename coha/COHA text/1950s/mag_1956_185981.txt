TEHILLA &; OTHER ISRAELI TALES ( 271 pp. ) -Abelard-Schuman ( $3.50 ) . <P> This anthology offers a sampling of a new national literature that is still in the process of being born . While all nine of the stories were originally written in Hebrew , only three of the authors are sabras* , born in Palestine and accustomed to the language from infancy . The others , coming as immigrants , had to learn vernacular Hebrew at ages ranging from 19 to 33 . Most of the stories reflect the authors ' predominantly European culture , and echoes of Voltaire , De Maupassant , James Joyce and Sholom Aleichem sound more clearly than do the wild notes of Oriental imagery or the deep rhythms of the Old Testament . <P> Curiously , none of the stories reflects the drama-packed years that marked the national struggle against Britain , the creation of Israel as a state , or the 1948 war against the Arab League . In David 's Bower by Yitzhak Shenhar there are young men in uniform and offstage gunfire , but the plot deals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrigue , religious argument , family bickering-and could just as easily have taken place in any Western capital . Two of the tales-Barhash and Hamamah-are about Arabs , not Jews , and reveal a surprising attachment for the way of life of Bedouin and fellahin . Others hold a mirror to contemporary Israeli life : Yehuda Yaari 's pastoral The Shepherd and His Dog reflects the sabra 's passionate love of his barren land ; Jerusalem-born Yehuda Burla writes wittily of the marriage between a stolid Oriental Jew and his hopelessly romantic Russian Jewish wife-which is also a marriage between two very different civilizations . <P> The title story , Tehilla , is perhaps the one most deeply infused with the Jewish past . On the surface a straightforward account of the saintly life and pious death of a venerable matriarch , it is luminous with ghetto wisdom , Hassidic mysticism and that sense of close kinship with God that has been the buckler of the Jews through the centuries . The Israeli writers are clearly still groping toward a native form of expression , and this book gives an indication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except possibly the Anglo-Indians , have so great an opportunity of drawing on the inexhaustible treasure houses of both East and West . <P> <P> * Literally , cactus plants , used to distinguish the supposedly tougher natives from the tenderfoot newcomers .
