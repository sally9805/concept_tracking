Just before the running of The Travers at Saratoga last Saturday , Brookmeade 's Elliott Burch crouched low and said to Manuel Ycaza , who was riding Sword Dancer , " Let him break slowly and then sit under wraps with him . Let the early pace run but do n't get fooled by it . Keep an eye on Middle Brother because he has a front-running jockey . " // A few yards away , Middle Brother 's rider , Bobby Ussery , was getting his orders from Owner-Trainer E. Barry Ryan : " One of these horses , probably Bagdad or Nimmer , will set the pace . But if everyone is throwing his horse down , you put Middle Brother on the lead . Otherwise lay off the pace but close to it . " // The race worked out perfectly for Burch and Ycaza . Nimmer went to the front and Middle Brother lay just off the pace , while Sword Dancer ran well in hand in fourth place and then third . Up the backside Ycaza 's instinct told him the pace was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll . He avoided one trap on the rail , swung to the outside and came up on Nimmer and Middle Brother , who turned for home like a close-coupled team . The three of them swept down the stretch together . Manuel took over for good inside the sixteenth pole , and Sword Dancer , his ears confidently cocked , pumped on to win going away by half a length . // Sword Dancer 's victory represented an outstanding example of coordination between horse , rider and trainer . This sort of successful harmony is unfortunately becoming more and more the exception rather than the rule . Only a handful of riders have the appreciation of pace and the discipline to blend their own instincts and ability with the specific instructions given them by the trainer . // The basic difference between a fine jockey and a journeyman rider is that the former supplements his riding ability with calculated thought while the latter trusts entirely too much to luck . One trainer insists , " Thinking is the thing . While the average boy is wondering what to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CONDITIONERS ' CONFUSION // Of course , this is not entirely the jockey 's fault . Some trainers thoroughly confuse inexperienced boys with long-winded series of orders , while others fail to give adequate instructions . I do n't suppose anybody likes to see the best horse in a race beaten because of a poor ride , and yet when this happens , seemingly valid excuses pop up on all sides . The trainer claims the boy failed to rate his horse properly . The boy says the horse was so full of run that he could n't rate him . // " This sort of thing happens all the time , " said Eddie Arcaro recently . " For every time that a trainer complains of a poor ride by a top jock , that jock usually has a pretty good excuse for what went wrong . Few races are ever run exactly the way a trainer wants them to be run , and a jockey has simply got to be given free rein to use his own judgment . " // " There are , " says Harry F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three basic things a trainer can tell a jockey . One , take the lead ; two , lay just off the pace ; or three , come from behind . " // " But the start , " adds Arcaro , " is usually the key to the whole thing . Sure , it may be easy enough to follow orders when you get the kind of start you want , but if you do n't , that 's when orders go out the window and you have to start riding your own race . " // " And that , " injects Trainer Syl Veitch , " is where riders like Arcaro , Shoemaker and Ycaza best demonstrate their natural superiority . " // Most of the successful trainers concentrate on briefing riders on the peculiarities of certain horses rather than on detailed general strategy . " The good boys , " says Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons , " you do n't have to tell much to , and the others there 's no point because they 've forgotten it all by the time they reach the post . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trainer wants me to do , " says Manuel Ycaza , " but I want to know about the horse , too . " // " Knowing your horse is as important , " adds Shoemaker , " as knowing what the opposition will probably do . Most trainers who ride me make a real point of telling me about every peculiarity a horse may have , such as he likes to bear out or lug in ; he rebels against sand kicked in his face if he gets in too close behind horses ; he runs freer if you circle the field instead of getting him down on the inside . If you know these things and have studied the form of the field , that 's when the trainer will tell me to use my own judgment . " // " Top jocks are top jocks because they 're supposed to have the best judgment , " says Arcaro . " If they rode 100% to orders all the time , the trainers would be the first to complain . " // RIDING IN FROM WHERE ? // But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shoemakers , Long-dens , Ycazas  --  coming from ? Supposedly , the supply of great jockeys is augmented annually by one or two green but ambitious boys rolling into the big time from the bush league circuits . This is hardly true . Few of the good riders who graduated from the half-milers made a name for themselves until they swung around the major tracks for half a dozen years or more . A jockey may learn some horsemanship and a good deal about courage in the bushes , most of that from riding gang-busting , to-hell-with-pace sprints day in and day out . But he still must learn  --  and he learns it only from a painfully discouraging grind in the big time  --  that race-riding in its fullest meaning is still a beautiful and skillful combination of competitive instinct , natural ability , disciplined horsemanship and intelligent thinking . // Maybe the answer , as Mr. Fitz suggests , is to change the apprentice rule to allow a boy 10 pounds ( instead of the present five ) for at least his first 20 winners . This would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and developing young riders . // Another suggestion  --  and one which The Jockey Club might well consider  --  is to have an organized jocks ' school with a limited enrollment of promising youngsters . An occasional race for apprentices only would n't upset the figure boys too much and , God knows , for the rest of us it would be much more interesting than the ninth race .
