txt Defense leaders are preparing to cut the next military budget as much as $11,500,000,000 below this year 's . This is said to be possible without any fiscal hitch in the " orderly build-up " of United States forces and arms or interfering with the foreign military aid program . The reasons for beginning a leveling off in armament outlays earlier than had been expected are twofold , according to Federal budget experts . One is that because of long " lead times " in the production of aircraft , tanks , ammunition and other " hardware " for the armed forces , funds already authorized by Congress cover much of the scheduled expansion of the services and their weapons . Of even greater significance , according to authoritative sources , is a growing awareness among defense officials that unless military demands are regulated and spaced , a " breaking point " in thecivilian economy might result in the loss of public support for the long-term preparedness program . Pentagon Drafting Budgets Some of the strongest appreciation of the need for a stable economy is understood to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are preparing their final budget requests . There are indications , however , that the generals and admirals will not take quickly or quietly to the level-off , philosophy . Long , hard wrangling is expected before the Defense Department can submit its 1953 fiscal year requests to the Bureau of the Midget . The Defense Department is expected to place a complete budget before Congress in January , rather than the " one-line " request submitted last year in the President 's over-all budget message . The detailed military budget was not completed until late April . On another defense budget front , President Truman delegated today to Manly Fleischmann , Defense Production Administrator , the authority to approve borrowing from the Treasury by Government agencies participating in defense mobilization . This action , taken at Key West , where the President is vacationing , was described by aides as " largely technical " to relieve the President of routine approvals. $54 Billions Expected Although , the figures are still tentative , it is expected that the combined spending authority to be sought for the three armed services and military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $54,000,000,000 . This compares to the $65,500,000,000 authorized by the last session of Congress for the military and arms aid . In round figures , the total spending authority in the Defense Department 's hands , including foreign // arms aid authorizations and dated front the start of the Korean conflict , is $110,000,000,000 . Another $2,000,000,000 is the expected size of either a supplemental request or a part of the 1953 fiscal year budget being prepared . The $2,000 , - 000,000 would replace the equip . ment fed into Korea , the planes lost , the tanks destroyed , , the hundreds of thousands of rounds of heavy and light ammunition , and other costs . There is an effort in defense budget planning to separate the cost of Korean fighting from ' the over-all military build-up of ready farces . If , as is expected , actual military expenditures amount to $44,000 , - 000,000 this fiscal year , ending June 30 , the three armed services in effect will have a balance of 818,000,000,000 . The greatest part of this authorization will have been obligated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Defense budget planning , which is said not to be operating under any ceiling set either by the White House or the Bureau ? of the Budget , is based on the belief that an additional $54,000,000,000 spending authority , of which $48,000 , - 000,000 might be for the military establishment , is , adequate for continued expansion . The planners foresee that the building of a " war reserve " of equipment would be scheduled at a slower rate than some in the military services are said to wish . Looking forward , defense production planners see the need for reserves of equipment decreasing sharply as military production lines become geared to a steady output that could be expanded in an emergency . The presently approved expansion programs of the Army , Navy and Air Force are covered to a large degree by appropriations , it is said . This is especially true of the Army , according to experts , and to a great extent of the Navy . It also is said that with present money and what would be allocated in the forthcoming 1953 budget , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue ' toward its ninety-five-wing goal . The reduction in spending authority as projected is said to acknowledge the increases in the size of the forces called for in the latest " force level " recommendations of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , a secret paper that has gone before the National Security Council and is reported to have been approved . The outstanding increase in the " force level " paper is in the Air Force  --  ninety-five to 143 groups . Underlying the proposal to reduce spending authority is said to be a desire to avoid . building up appropriations beyond a point at which they can be spent . It is estimated that in fiscal 1953 deliveries to the military will total $60,000,000,000 . Effect on Civilians Less Should this defense budget thinking prevail ; it is felt that the huge military expansion will dislocate the civilian economy and supplies of consumer goods much less than forecast in some quarters . Forecasts of the Office of Defense Mobilization , headed by Charles E. Wilson , show that the gross national product is running at an annual rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share of that total amounts now to somewhat more than $30,000 , - 000,000 . These figures are purported to demonstrate that the country can remain easily stable despite the defense effort . Some Pentagon planners point out , however , that of the $325,000 , - 000,000 national product total , only about $115,000,000,000 represents actual " hard " goods and construction . In this category , defense and atomic energy programs are currently said to be at the rate of $23,000,000,000 and increasing rapidly to the point where they will near 50 per cent by the middle of next year . This realization is said to be behind the desire to curtail military expenditures other than those necessary to meet real production expectations .
