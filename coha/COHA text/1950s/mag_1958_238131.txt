Like nine other states since the Supreme Court 's 1954 school-desegregation decision , Alabama enacted a pupil-placement law which by common agreement was designed to thwart integration . Last week the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Alabama 's law-on its face-and provoked hopeful Southern punditry about having finally found a legal way around integration . The punditry was premature . <P> The Alabama law sets up 17 separate standards for assigning pupils to public schools . Nowhere is the question of race or color mentioned , but school boards obviously had a wide-open chance to preserve the segregation status quo in several placement qualifications , including : 1 ) " the psychological qualification of the pupil for the type of teaching and associates involved , " 2 ) " the possibility of threat of friction or disorder , " 3 ) " the possibility of breaches of the peace or ill will or economic retaliation within the community , " and 4 ) " the maintenance or severance of established social and psychological relationships with other pupils and with teachers . " <P> Last May a three-judge federal panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 17 qualifications were , in and of themselves , unconstitutional unless proved , by evidence submitted to the courts , to be administered so as to exclude Negroes from white schools . " In some future proceeding , " warned the lower court , " the law may be declared unconstitutional in its applications . " That , in sum , was the judgment that the Supreme Court sustained last week . <P> " There 's a new law of the land today on the integration problems of public schools , " proclaimed Columnist David Lawrence , a Virginia Democrat . " Token integration now has become possible on a constitutional basis everywhere . " Alabama 's Lieutenant Governor-elect Albert Boutwell , one of the leading advocates of the law , talked of calling a South-wide conference to spread his doctrine . But what the Supreme Court had actually done was grant Alabama the right that it or any other state is entitled to : the presumption of good faith until otherwise proved . When and if Alabama demonstrates by its application of the pupil-placement law that it is aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another Supreme Court ruling will control . In its Little Rock decision last September , the Supreme Court specifically barred any " evasive scheme for segregation , whether attempted ingeniously or ingenuously . "
