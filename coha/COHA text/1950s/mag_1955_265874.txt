The Desperate Hours ( adapted from his novel by Joseph Hayes ) provides this season-and probably next-with a thriller after its own loud-beating heart . Playwright Hayes has fashioned an up-to-date old-fashioned melodrama about three escaped convicts who move in on a respectable Indianapolis family while waiting for getaway money from a confederate . The situation is rich in all kinds of human and ironic and psychological possibilities . But in The Desperate Hours such aspects pretty much lurk in corners . It is excitement that is stationed at the front door , suspense that guards the back , and tension that sneaks looks through the window . <P> Yet audiences will find something real , if not very realistic , in just such a setup . They ca n't help feeling like a truly captive audience , ca n't help identification with the Billiards-father and mother ( well played by Karl Maiden and Nancy Coleman ) , daughter and son . And this sense of normal life suddenly swimming in nightmare lends a special piquancy to an otherwise movielike chronicle of thrills . <P> The Desperate Hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick snatches at police headquarters . The invaders make half the family go to work on pain of killing the other half at the slightest peep . Nor can the Hilliards set any trap that they wo n't also tumble into themselves . Even the police , after they have broken the story , ca n't shoot things out without maybe killing Hilliards instead of hoodlums . <P> Twisting and turning , the play ( expertly directed by Robert Montgomery ) achieves a maximum of melodramatic thrills , if never quite of spine-chilling terror .
