To winebibbing Frenchmen it was heresy , or worse , when eminent physicians suggested that the French are getting too much of a good thing ( TIME , June 16 ) . So members of the government 's High Committee for Study and Information on Alcoholism , chosen in 1954 " for their independence , their authority , and their knowledge of the problem , ' ' knew just what was expected of them . Last week the gist of the committee 's 223-page report leaked to the press . To nobody 's surprise , it was heartily in favor of wine . <P> Bordeaux University 's Professor Jean Ribrau-Gayon contributed such items as : " The richness of the grape in vitamins of group B has not been stressed sufficiently . Commercial wine is considerably richer in vitamins than commercial grape juice of the same vintage . " ( Bordeaux happens to be synonymous with claret and sauterne . ) Another Bordeaux University professor , Jacques Masquelier , got carried away with the results of some sophomoric experiments . He concluded that claret is on a par @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be better because it slaughters staphylococci , many strains of which are now resistant to penicillin . <P> Other committee members attacked the bugaboo of cirrhosis of the liver , managed to convince themselves that it was a greatly exaggerated hazard , because in a sampling at a big Paris hospital . 35% of the cirrhosis victims survived the disease . Somehow , this struck the committee as more significant than the fact that almost twice as many died . <P> What separated the men from the boys was the definition of moderation . " To many Frenchmen , " said the committee , " to drink moderately means to absorb two , three or four liters of wine a day . " The Academy of Medicine suggested that one liter ( 1.0567 U.S. liquid quarts ) should be enough , but the committee went further , urged that nobody exceed a liter a day . <P> On one point there was no argument : the frugal French are most frugal with water . In the villages , the committee found , " water is employed with parsimony . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price goes up .
