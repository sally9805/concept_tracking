Five hours before the concert , a platoon of coolies moved into the open-air concert area and enveloped it in a cloud of insecticide to kill off the mosquitoes . An hour later , two coolies armed with spools of adhesive tape started affixing location tags to the rows of folding seats . At C-hour-minus-30 minutes , the national flags of Viet Nam and the U.S. were in place . As the darkness gathered , the men of the orchestra took their places , and promptly at 8 p.m. the conductor raised his baton . Moments later one more corner of Asia was introduced to the strange and wondrous sounds of a live Western symphony orchestra . Occasion : a first concert in Saigon , Viet Nam , by Manhattan 's touring Little Orchestra Society . <P> In an eight-week tour touching eight Asian countries from India to Japan , Founder-Conductor Thomas Scherman and his 45 musicians got a reception to set their heads awhirl . Everywhere , crowds were eager , the reviews fine . Shouted the audience in Kowloon , Hong Kong : " Bravo ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a rare sample of contemporary U.S. music , Conductor Scherman performed works by Wallingford Riegger , Virgil Thomson , Frederick Jacobi , Aaron Copland , discovered that they were just as warmly received as the repertory regulars-Beethoven , Mendelssohn , Mozart . <P> A highlight of the tour proved to be a subtle blend of Occident and Orient : the world premiere in Madras , India , of Symphony No. 13 by California-born Henry Cowell , a composer who has perched for many of his 62 years like an elfin Janus atop the steep divide between Eastern and Western music . <P> The " Madras " Symphony was scored for a normal symphony orchestra minus trumpets , trombones and tubas . Added were tablas ( tuned Indian hand drums ) and the jalatarang ( a set of eleven porcelain rice bowls of different pitch , depending on size and thickness ) . The players of the tablas and jalatarang had their entrance cues but were otherwise free to improvise , if necessary , around Cowell 's themes .

Strongly flavored with the haunting sonorities of early Japanese court music , Ongaku was a success with the older members of the audience , but left some of the younger ones , whose musical diet is increasingly Western , faintly puzzled . Said one : " Frankly , it 's too Japanese for us ; it 's a bit over our heads . "
