It was all very well to show that there is something in cigarette smoke that can cause lung cancer , but the proof of this ( TIME , Nov. 30 ) still left a further question unanswered . Why do city dwellers seem to get more lung cancer than folk down on the farm with the same smoking or nonsmoking ) habits ? Could it be something in the air ? <P> The answer is yes , say four University of Southern California researchers , headed by Dr. Paul Kotin , in the Archives of industrial Hygiene and Occupational Medicine . From samples of Los Angeles air ( collected on both smoggy and clear days ) , the experimenters filtered out the chemicals . They painted the resulting goolon the backs of black mice . In little more than a year , 29% of the surviving mice developed malignant tumors . From gasoline-engine exhausts the researchers prepared a similar slime : 26% of the mice got cancer . Identical mice , under the same conditions but unpainted , showed not a single tumor.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
