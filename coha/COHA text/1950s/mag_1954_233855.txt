On the same weird , wild note with which they had begun ten weeks ago , the P.W . explanations in the Korean neutral zone ended last week . On that last day , U.N . explainers broadcast a final appeal to the 22 Americans , one Briton and 77 pro-Red South Koreans who refused to go home and refused to be interviewed . The broadcast words were wasted breath . The prisoners refused to listen , linked arms for a Korean folk dance , banged cymbals , tried to drown out the loudspeakers with Communist songs . When the broadcast appeal was over , the U.N . explainers waited around for half an hour , then abandoned the prisoners to the consequences of their choice . <P> The handful of Americans had got a disproportionate amount of headline space of late , almost enough to lend a spurious evenhandedness to the failure of " explaining " by either side . The facts were quite the contrary . On the U.N . side are more than 22,000 Chinese and North Korean prisoners who have renounced Communism . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and persuaded only 138-or less than 1%-to return to their Communist homelands . <P> Final defections : 22,000 Communists ; 22 Americans . <P> This week the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission reported on the failure of its P.W . explanations . India , which had generally been in agreement with the Swiss and Swedes , abruptly reversed itself , and formed a majority with Communist Poland and Communist Czechoslovakia . This majority blamed South Korea for the fact that many anti-Red prisoners refused to be interviewed , and declared that the South Korean provost marshal in Seoul had an organization that functioned through the 64th U.N . Field Hospital and extended through all 55 compounds to coerce North Koreans and Chinese from going home . Refusing to sign this report , Sweden and Switzerland blamed drag-out tactics of Red interviewing teams for the failure . <P> Presumably , now that the explanations deadline is past , the 22,000 Chinese and North Koreans who chose freedom will have the opportunity of settling in South Korea or some other free country . The 22 Americans presumably will have a brief display value in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
