The KLM transatlantic DC-6B , with only twelve of 66 seats occupied , was just 25 miles from the safety of Amsterdam 's Schiphol Airport . The pilot , Captain Charles Harman , 36 , a veteran of 170 Atlantic crossings , was more than an hour ahead of schedule on a flight from New York 's Idlewild Field . Some time in the next few minutes , the plane plummeted into the cold waters of the North Sea . Residents of the Dutch town of Schoorl reported that they heard an explosion , but no one knew what had gone wrong . All aboard were killed : 21 persons , including seven Americans . <P> The crash put a dent in a remarkable record : since an Air France plane crashed in the Azores in October 1949 , the scheduled airlines had made more than 60,000 transatlantic hops between North America and Europe , carrying more than 2,000,000 people , without a fatality.
