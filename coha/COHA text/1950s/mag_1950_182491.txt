The Menu Manace <P> " What in heaven 's name is Chicken Marengo ? " whispered the diner , bemused prototype of millions of restaurant guests . " I do n't know , " his wife whispered back . " Why do n't you ask the waiter ? " The gentleman looked embarrassed . " Certainly not , " he said . " I will order the hamburger steak . " <P> Last week , an unexpected champion arose for the millions who can not tell Chicken Marengo* from Escalope de Foie Gras Talleyrand+ from Surprise Omelet Milord- from apple pie a la mode. ++ The champion was a writer for Budapest 's Communist daily Vilagossag , who ( he related in his column ) recently walked into a " people 's restaurant " and promptly had his appetite ruined by an item on the menu called Tournedos a , la Metternich. *Nor was this all . Austria 's great conservative statesman , " this symbol of European reaction , " was joined on the menu by a symbol of British imperialism-Veal Steak a la Nelson-and one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other dishes whose names had no politically dyspeptic connotations , but which were simply obscurantist , e.g. , Filet de Fogas Orly , ++ Veau a la Bonne Femme. - <P> Patrons of a people 's restaurant , wrote the irate columnist , would hardly order dishes whose names they either could not understand or which called up memories to turn any decent proletarian stomach . " Competent quarters should take to heart this piece of advice-a restaurant filled with workers is of more value than a ' bonne femme ' in the company of Prince Esterhazy or Prince Metternich . " Furthermore , it simply did not make sense " that a dish of veal should have five different names , each of which is priced higher according to its unintelligibility . . . " <P> Most of the world 's gastronomic jargon was created in the 18th and 19th Centuries by log-rolling cooks to commemorate their masters ' favorite dishes . Some European aristocrats were also amateur cooks and imposed their names on their concoctions , e.g. , Count Stroganoff , a 19th Century Russian diplomat and inventor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of great events , e.g. , Pheasant a la Holy Alliance. + <P> Culinary nomenclature subtly manages to convey certain historic sidelights . Metternich , whose name on any menu stands for paprika , was a firm enemy of Hungarian nationalism but a great lover of Hungary 's national spice . The Esterhazy family , gastronomic historians aver , oscillated for centuries between opulence and ( relative ) frugality : one generation would have to economize by eating things like beefsteak a la Esterhazy ( made from a cheaper cut of meat ) because their heedless fathers had eaten too many Tournedos a la Metternich .
