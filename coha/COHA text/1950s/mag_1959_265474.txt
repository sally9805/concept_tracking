After Teamster Boss Jimmy Hoffa threatened a general strike if Congress passes a labor reform bill ( TIME , June 1 ) Editorial Cartoonist Jim Dobbins , 34 , of the Sunday Boston Herald ( circ. 293,904 ) , drew the tough trucker as a club-carrying cave man guarding a skull-littered tunnel labeled " Truck Route , U.S.A. " ( see cut ) . <P> Enraged , Hoffa bristled into Boston last week to exhort Local 25 and excoriate the press . With a glare at reporters , Hoffa roared that the press 's spleen might well stem from the fact that in some communities his drivers make more than newsmen . Cried he : " My responsibility is far and beyond some cartoonists or editorial writers , who want to display their high school skills to embarrass you and possibly put you in prison . " <P> Jim Dobbins , a frequent baiter of labor bosses though an American Newspaper Guild member himself , quite plainly saw his own responsibility , sat down at his drawing board and , with his characteristic heavy-lined style ( " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , once again exposed Jimmy in his bearskin ( see cut ) . Said Dobbins . " I 'm pleased that I scored-he seemed such a hard guy to penetrate with ridicule. "
