THE ALICE B. TOKLAS COOK BOOK ( 288 pp. ) - Alice B. Toklas-Harper ( $4 ) . <P> <P> It is reasonably certain that no man ever said to Alice B. Toklas : " If you could only cook ! " Small , wiry and quite bereft of feminine charm , she was once cattily described as " the lady with the melancholy nose . " But cook she could-or at least she went into the kitchen armed with glorious recipes . <P> For close to 40 years Alice was companion , housekeeper and quite often chief cook and bottle washer for Fellow U.S. Expatriate Gertrude Stein , who made her name a literary household word with The Autobiography of Alice B. Toklas ( which was , of course , the autobiography of Gertrude Stein ) . One thing the two spinsters and their arty friends loved was good food , and it was up to Alice to see that they got it , because Gertrude herself did n't like household work or even " to see work being done . " Gertrude died in 1946 leaving Alice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written a book herself , and , since it is a cook book , it is probably more usable and readable than Author Stein 's own volumes . <P> Bass for Pablo . The recipes range from serviceable to mouthwatering . They are , fortunately , not restricted to the elusive complexities of French cuisine , but make some gratifying forays into solid Viennese and Hungarian cooking . Their names alone are fascinating , e.g. , Dublin Coffee James Joyce , Hot Toddy for Cold Night , Nameless Cookies , Very Good Chocolate Mousse , Tricolored Omelette , Chicken in Half Mourning , Scheherazade 's Melon , Virgin Sauce . <P> But what gives the Cook Book its special charm is the stream of Alice 's prattle , in which the recipes appear like floating islands , in no particular order . Her own recipe for striped bass , for instance , was worked out when she made lunch for Artist Pablo Picasso . He " exclaimed at its beauty " and modestly protested that it should have been created in honor of Matisse instead . In Palma de Mallorca , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place by showing Alice how to smother pigeons ( the cook said it made them fuller and tastier ) . The information came in handy when Alice fixed some braised pigeons on croutons for Gertrude , using six " sweet young corpses " choked by her own hands . Her Frangipani Tart ( decorated with homemade French and American flags ) was the dessert following a liberation lunch when the U.S. Army moved into the town of Culoz , where Gertrude and Alice had settled down during World War II .
