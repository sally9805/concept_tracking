Police in seven states were looking for Alfred A. Knopf Jr. , only son of leading Publisher ( Borzoi Books ) , Gourmet and Skier Alfred A. Knopf Sr. Young ( 19 ) Knopf had left home and a summer job with a printing firm , despondent over being refused by Princeton , and determined ( as he said in a note ) not to return till he made good . A week later police found him in Salt Lake City , barefoot , hungry and broke . He had started out with $15 , the last $2 of which someone had stolen from him while he was sleeping on a lawn in Utah . Bitterly , " Pat " Knopf noted that only truck drivers had helped him ( " The rest of the people are a bunch of damned snobs " ) in his hitchhike attempt to reach Reno , where he " knew a lot of rich people " and hoped to get started on his own . <P> That was 22 years ago . Since then , would-be Princetonian Knopf went to college ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firm in which his father is board chairman and his mother president . But he still knows some rich people , and he still wants to make it on his own . Last week Publishers ' Row was startled by the news that a major new publishing firm was being founded by Pat Knopf and two big bookmen-Hiram Haydn , 51 , for the past three years editor in chief of Random House , and Simon Michael Bessie , 43 , one of the top editors of Harper . <P> In a fiercely competitive trade with big risks , small profit margins and notoriously old-fashioned business methods , the launching of new firms is rare . Said one intrigued bystander about the Knopf-Haydn-Bessie venture : " It is as if the presidents of General Motors , Chrysler and Ford left their jobs to start an automobile company . " Said one publishing bigwig , who lunched with Random House Boss Bennett Cerf a week ago : " When the rumor came up , Bennett 's face was a real study . " <P> More than Circus . By this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think it 's a wonderful thing for the book business . They should be very , very successful . " Pat Knopf 's new partners are certainly very , very savvy editors . Harper 's Bessie ( past jobs : U.S. public affairs officer in the Paris embassy , Look editor , OWI ) has worked with such authors as Marcel Ayme , Alfred Hayes and John Cheever . Random House 's Haydn ( past jobs : editor of Crown and Bobbs-Merrill ) edits The American Scholar , the Phi Beta Kappa journal , teaches fiction writing at the New School for Social Research . He wrote several novels , notably The Time Is Noon ( 1948 ) , a panoramic view of American life that included some acid sidelights on the publishing business . In one scene , an ambitious junior editor is building up an awful novel to please a top publisher ( " who wore knickers to the office and had only Wall Street friends " ) . The big man rewards him with : " I think you 'll like publishing . . . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it is n't all circus tricks . "
