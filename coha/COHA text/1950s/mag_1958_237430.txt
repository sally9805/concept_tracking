As West Germany 's Minister of Defense , beefy , hard-driving Franz Josef Strauss has been a vigorous foe of Prussianism . Whenever the officers of West Germany 's new , " democratic " army showed any signs of reverting to the autocratic traditions of the Junkers , Bavarian-born Minister Strauss cracked down hard-and thereby won the applause of most of his countrymen . But last week Franz Josef Strauss was learning firsthand the full depth of West Germans ' postwar distaste for jack-in-office arrogance . <P> The trouble began when Strauss , on his way to an appointment with Chancellor Konrad Adenauer , decided to use a short cut-a small , one-way alley officially reserved for der Alte himself but informally open to any of his ministers . When Bonn Traffic Officer Siegfried Hahlbohm , 24 , failed to give Strauss 's car an immediate signal into the alley , the impatient minister ordered his driver , Leonhard Kaiser , to go ahead anyway . Kaiser did so , thereby forcing the conductor of an oncoming trolley car on the main thoroughfare to slam on his emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the chancellery , Good Cop Hahlbohm dutifully noted down its license number . <P> His meeting with Adenauer ended , Strauss shot out of the chancellery again , pulled up beside Hahlbohm 's pedestal . " Give me your name , " growled Franz Josef . " I shall see to it that you disappear from this corner . " True to his threat , Strauss promptly fired off a pair of angry letters-one to the chief of Bonn 's traffic police , another to the interior ministry of the state of North Rhine-Westphalia . In the meantime , the police coolly ran a check on Driver Kaiser , turned up the fact that he had a record of five arrests on charges ranging from speeding to driving without a license . And from the West German policemen 's union came an irate demand that Strauss be charged with an attempt to exert improper influence . <P> At week 's end Policeman Hahlbohm was still at his accustomed post , gracefully accepting the bouquets , bottles of brandy and cheers proffered him by passing motorists . As for Franz Josef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the chancellery alley-but only , noted Bonn police headquarters , " after the proper signal from the policeman on duty . "
