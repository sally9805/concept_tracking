It SEEMS probable that from now 1 on . we shall be receiving movies from Japan and elsewhere in the Orient at reasonably frequent intervals . Most of these , as the Daiei Studio in Tokyo announces of its program , will be " quality " films intended for the export market . " Rashomon , " " Ugetsu , " and now " The Gate of Hell " are all Daiei productions ; it is evident that for export therm will draw upon the folklore and traditions of Japanese culture . This presents an exciting problem to the Western observer . Not only must he try to grasp the impulse behind the deeds of people with whose reactions and habits of logic he is unacquainted , not only must he respond . to excerpts from a culture that is almost entirely closed to him ; he must also try to gauge how much of what seems to him savage , archaic , or exotic would seem so also to an Oriental spectator . Here are a few enigmatic items from " The Gate of Hell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hero repeatedly squirting water through his teeth into ' the face of the swooning heroine . He has a stream and a dipper handy , so why this particular restorative method ? Perhaps it is a rough gesture that for a Japanese immediately evokes the olden days  --  like Lancelot tossing an ox bone under the banquet table ; perhaps it has erotic overtones lost on Westerners . A more important point : the action of the picture , set in the twelfth century , develops from the intransigent passion of a Samurai warrior for the happily married wife of a fellow-officer . The Samurai , we suppose , are a class governed by an elaborate code of honor , but this dangerously inflamed gallant makes an - absurd public nuisance of himself without seriously losing face in the corps . This clashes with our notion of how military aristocracies have governed themselves from Charlemagne to the Death 's Head Hussars . Would it strike the Japanese as odd , or do they accept tantrums in the highest castes ? A final question , though the picture raises many more : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yearning delicacy and shy respect rarely if ever encountered in Occidental portrayals of domestic love . Obviously this is an idyl of marriage , but how far does it parallel the customary decencies of Japanese family life ? To an American audience the film will be more impressive for its visual details than for its narrative . The movie is awkwardly balanced  --  a too important prelude of plots and battles fades inconclusively to make way for what is essentially a story of private conflict  --  and it moves abruptly , as though each scene were the synopsis of a scene , with the motivation and rising tension omitted . In Japan the story may be so well known that people can fill it out for themselves . It is the first Japanese film in color that we have seen , and it may be The best movie color we have ever seen . That is not because the Japanese have found some superior process  --  they are using Eastman color , which the producers ' went to Rochester to study  --  but because the people responsible for this picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took pains that nothing they photographed should offend it . The settings have a similar unassertive perfection : there is an amateur horse race , there are the elegant ritual ceremovies , there are fragments of countryside and seashore , a few interiors , household instruments and utensils  --  all chosen and placed and composed to seduce the eye . The houses glow with a warmer and stronger color than the model house on view at the Museum of Modern Art would lead you to expect ; they seem more spacious when poised Japanese actors move through them than the museum house does when thronged with wide-gesturing Americans . The acting in " The Gate of Hell " looks to be on two levels . Kazuo Hasegawa , the love-mad hero , and Machiko Kyo , the faithful wife , appear to be governed 1 ; ; fy stylized forms . He grimaces like a devil mask and moves with the abrupt square grace of a Kabuki dancer , which he once was . She , although playing a woman of both will and courage , sidles and trembles like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her begging eyes and the weak mumbling of her tiny mouth . These are perhaps Japanese ideals of masculine and feminine carriage , but they are not ours and the mannerisms mask the personalities . The other actors work in a more natural style : the husband bears himself with an honest , slow gravity and his face shows a quiet humor when it is not troubled . The military commander is an expansive good fellow , the attendants are conventionally bureaucratic , and the subsidiary , Samurai officers are the arrogant , quick-. gestured , loud-laughing mercenaries of a military society . AT THIS stage in the theatrical history of J. B. Priestley 's " An Inspector Calls " it can not be revealing a confidence to say that the official of the title is a rum sort of cop . He is the human conscience or the recording angel or some other extrasensory arm of the law , and he provides Alastair Sim with a role of such - exceedingly smug whimsicality that even that most smug and whimsical of actors can scarcely fill it . Mr. Priestley is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spurn him , but I object to having my leg pulled for the good of my soul . The message of " An Inspector Calls " is that it is very wrong to kick a fellow human being in the stomach and that if we go about doing that sort of thing we may one day be ashamed of ourselves . Mr. Priestley evidently feels that this is an December 11 , 1954 abstruse ethical concept , for he erects a most elaborate structure of coincidence and mystification to prove it . THE one important thing about the screen version of Odets 's " The Country Girl " is that it presents , Bing Crosby in a part other than that of the irresistible Bing . He not only plays someone else , he plays someone exceedingly unpleasant  --  a mean , self-pitying , hypocritical drunk  --  and that is a bold thing for him to do . He has received the highest prices ever paid for charm and insouciance , and it took courage to chuck I T SEEMS that in the building of one of the first tunnels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river bed to the surface of the water without fatal injury . This extraordinary occurrence provides the dramatic core of " Sandhog , " a ballad in three acts by Earl Robinson and Waldo Salt at the Phoenix Theater . There is sornething lusty  --  almost gay ? in the event itself , and the artistic purpose of " Sandhog " is to sing a song in praise of the hard work which goes into the epic task of constructing a tunnel , a bridge , a railroad , or a darn . These giant enterprises , the authors seem to be saying , are the fruits of the labor of sturdy men and the sacrifices of steadfast women , the virtually nameless , heroes of our history  --  glorious history which we should recount with pride . One wonders , then , why " Sandhog " fails to be inspiring , why its emphasis , which should be bold , hearty , Whitmanesque , remains predominantly gloomy and painful . That the authors and director did not wish it so is evident in Sophie Maslow 's charming choreography for children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " Katie O'Sullivan " and " Johnny 0 . " But there is no escaping the feeling that there is more masochism than majesty in " Sandhog . " Its forbear , Marc Blitzstein 's " The Cradle Will Rock , " written as " revolutionary theater " during the depression , had a more vigorous spirit and was actually cheerier in its effect . In " Sandthem . But it looks like the right move . Crosby 's timing and stage sense have always been flawless , and he uses them now , not to project himself , but'to make you forget him in your preoccupation with the not sensationally interesting character he plays . He engages your sympathy for an odious weakling , he makes you believe in this man 's rather unconvincing reformation , he reads some perilous lines with more dignity than they deserve . Given good material , Crosby could become an accomplished actor after the longest and most successful vaudeville turn of our time . hog , " as one listens to the ominous opening number , " Come Down , " and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " bends " or the somewhat lighter one celebrating the amount of sweat poured out of the sandhog 's body in performing his stint , one becomes aware of the sharp discrepancy between the purpose of this play and the temper in which it is executed . The spirit would be the spirit of Jacob , but the body is the body of Esau . . The authors find it difficult to be happy . For the fifties they need to be , if not exactly exultant , then at least pleasant , but theirs is the approach of the thirties ? except that it is cramped by the fact that in the thirties there was enthusiasm in protest , while in the fifties , if protest is in one 's heart and one has chosen a subject which does not call for protest , it is hard to be hale . Even the setting by Howard Bay is contradictory .
