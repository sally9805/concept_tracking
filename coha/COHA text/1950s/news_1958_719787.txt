txt Senator Kennedy of Massachusetts and Senator Cooper of Kentucky have n't got a great deal in common with Marshal Tito . But the three of them are unwittingly forging some strong handcuffs for the U.S. foreign aid program . The Senate has adopted a resolution which reads in part : " It is the sense of the Congress that it is in the interests of the United States to join with other nations in providing support of the type , magnitude , and duration adequate to assist India to complete successfully its current program for economic development . " In other words , the Senators think we ought to be bound to help India atthin its own brand of pretty socialistic economy no matter how long it takes or how much money  --  India 's is a Five Year , about $15 billion Plan , but such endeavors do have a habit of growing bigger and lasting longer . Well , now , what 's Tito of Yugoslavia got to do with this ? Only that he intends to go a bit beyond the proposition that givers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to depend on it and get mad when they 're cut off . Tito plans to sue Russia . Russia promised Yugoslavia aid , but is withholding it now because Titowo n't play ball with the rest of the Communist bloc . So the Yugoslav foreign minister called in the Moscow ambassador the other day and handed him a note which read : " In the case the Soviet government fails to honor fully the credits agreement , Yugoslavia would be compelled to claim damages incurred to the Yugoslav economy by the Soviet unilateral act . " Quite frankly , we do n't know where Tito would file his claim or how he would collect his damages  --  except maybe in the court of world opinion . But if he does succeed in having the world adopt the principle that foreign aid ca n't be withheld or ended once promised and started that would be bad enough for Uncle Sam . But it would be considerably worse if Uncle Sam were handcuffed to Tito 's proposition by a thoughtless and needless principle we adopted ourselves . We can imagine circumstances under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut off aid to India . We ca n't imagine any circumstances , though , which should induce the Congress to bind this country to provide support of untold magnitude and for unknown duration for any other nation in the world .
