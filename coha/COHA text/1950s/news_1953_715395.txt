txt On Aug. 4 , 1735 , John Peter Zenger , printer and publisher , was acquitted by a jury , out for only ten minutes , of a charge that his newspaper published false , malicious and seditious discussions " tending to alienate the affections of the people of this province from His Majesty 's Government . " Hundreds of people awaiting the verdict greeted it with " three Hurra 's , " as a contemporary press account put it , and the lawyer , the gifted Andrew Hamilton of Philadelphia , who had defended Zenger was saluted on his departure from the city the next day with a volley from the great guns of several ships in the harbor . This was in " public testimony of the glorious defence he made in the cause of liberty in this province . " Dedication today of the John Peter Zenger Memorial in the old Sub-Treasury Building at Wall , Nassau and Pine Streets will open to the public a new and appropriate place of remembrance for this courageous pioneer . It is the site of the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial . It is in an area rich in colonial history , with surroundings that reffesh our awareness that the freedom to publish , to speak , to worship as one will , and all the other freedoms dearly won and always needing to be guarded zealously , are not single freedoms but one edifice . When one freedom is lost or diminished the safety of the whole structure is in danger . The historian Herbert L. Osgood of Columbia pointed out that Zenger 's contribution was to help establish that the affairs of government should be public , and therefore it was the business of private men to " meddle " with government . Zenger and his wife Anna , who continued publication while he was in jail awaiting trial , believed that , as their Journal said , " Every man ought to know what it concerns all to know . " Nothing on earth was of a more universal nature than government , and every man had a concern in it , because in it were at stake " his virtue , his property and the security of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections , courts and government  --  not necessarily or even often from his own pen  --  that were contagious in their inspiration of a new courage and boldness in the press throughout the colonies . Many utterances of the Journal are apt today , as : " The difference between free and enslaved countries lies principally here , that in the former the magistrates must consult the voice and interest of the people , but in the latter the private will , interest and pleasure of the governors are the sole end and motives of their administration . " There are other memorials to Zenger , the immigrant from Germany who came to America as a boy of 13 and later set up a printing shop on Broad Street in lower Manhattan . One of these is in Westchester County , another the recently dedicated Zenger Public School in the Bronx . This new memorial is the tribute of newspapers throughout the country . But it is for all to visit who cherish freedom .                 @ @ @ @
