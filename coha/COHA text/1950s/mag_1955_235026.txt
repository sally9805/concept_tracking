The 114-year-old Brooklyn Eagle has been for sale ever since Eagle Publisher Frank D. Schroth closed it down after a 47-day strike of the Newspaper Guild . But no buyers have appeared . One reason they have been scared off is some $750,000 in severance credit , vacation pay , etc. , that the union claims the paper owes its 315 striking members , an obligation a buyer might have to take on . Furthermore , a new publisher would face the same labor problems that Publisher Schroth faced ( TIME , Feb. 28 ) . The Guild has shown no signs of compromising its original demands , is still picketing the Eagle building . Last week Schroth set a deadline in his efforts to save Brooklyn 's only daily . If the paper can not be sold as a unit to a responsible publisher by May 2 , he announced , its mechanical equipment , subscription lists and furnishings will be sold piecemeal at auction .
