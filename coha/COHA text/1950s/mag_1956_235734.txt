Manhattan 's Daily Worker faithfully follows the Communist Party line , however suddenly it may swerve , wriggle or tie itself into knots . Last week , in the aftermath of Joseph Stalin 's tumble from grace ( TIME , March 26 ) , the Worker gave the weird impression of having come to the end of the line-or at least the end of its rope . <P> One indignant letter to the Worker ran : " You have followed successive flip-flops with amazing jolt-proof gymnastic dexterity , without ever being at a loss for editorial words . The doctors were plotting , the doctors were not ; Beria was in , Beria was out ; Tito was out , Tito was in ; Yugoslavia was a dictatorship with ruthless suppression of opposition , Yugoslavia is finding its independent path to socialism ; Stalin is up , Stalin is down . . . The Daily Worker editors had carved out a position even more unassailable than the Soviet leaders have claimed for them selves . The Soviet leaders admitted to previous mistakes . The Daily Worker editors smoothly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> In another letter to the editor , Ring Lardner Jr .. one of the " Hollywood Ten . " wondered whether the kind of one-man worship so deplorable in Stalin 's case might not have influenced the " rather maudlin testaments to William Z. Foster on his recent birthday . " In the same sentence , evidently feeling no inconsistency . Lardner described U.S. Communist Boss Foster as " America 's outstanding working-class leader . " <P> The Worker flip-flopped so energetically that no one , not even Nikita Khrushchev , was sacred to its letter writers . <P> Wrote one : " If there is one central point to the present revaluation now taking place in the U.S.S.R .. it is that nobody is infallible . Stalin certainly was not-and Khrushchev is not . Undoubtedly the Soviet reappraisal of Stalin will be far more comprehensive than any which ' outsiders ' will produce . . . But this is not to say that American Marxists should accept automatically and uncritically the views of Soviet leaders-who are , after all . not without responsibility for Stalin 's errors . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal too much ' leaving it to the Russians ' already . "
