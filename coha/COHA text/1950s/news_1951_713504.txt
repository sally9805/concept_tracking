" In a serious vein the Vice President recalled crises and problems that had beset the Union during its earlier days . A topic of debate , he recalled - from college days , was whether signs of the times pointed to the downfall of the ' Republic . Politicians , he added , saw the ship of state in sinking condition . " We have grown ' in power , in wealth , in population and in influence , " he said . ' " We have grown also in liberty , despite the fact that now and . then we are told that we have lost all of our liberties or about to lose them . " Today our danger does not come from within , although  --  we are not a perfect democracy or a perfect republic , and We have in our system inequalities Which we try to correct and should correct .
