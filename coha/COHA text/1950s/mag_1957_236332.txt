In Djakarta schoolboys filled the sky with kites , and shops , taxis and streetcars blossomed out with flags to mark the twelfth anniversary of Indonesia 's declaration of independence from The Netherlands. * Gazing out on the festive scene last week , the Times of Indonesia somberly declared : " This is perhaps the bleakest Independence Day we shall be celebrating . " <P> The Times had in mind the election returns trickling in from provincial assembly elections in overcrowded Java , home of two-thirds of Indonesia 's 80 million people . The provincial assemblies are primarily advisory and therefore not very consequential , but as a sampling of the current trend of Indonesian public opinion , the elections were intensely disquieting . In three of Indonesia 's biggest cities - Bandung , Semarang and Surabaya-the Communists either won absolute majorities or gained 100% over their 1955 vote . In east and central Java the Reds seemed sure to emerge as the biggest single party , and even in west Java , stronghold of the Moslem Masjumi Party , they had apparently replaced President Sukarno 's Nationalists as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outs , the Communists gained by the government 's failure to cope with the problems of poverty , corruption and revolt . But they were also helped materially by spellbinding President Sukarno , who ever since he came back from Mao 's China , has been urging " guided democracy " and pressuring for the inclusion of Communists in the Cabinet . ( He has already given them seats in his own hand-picked new " temporary " National Council . ) <P> The discrediting of the democratic parties , and the Communist triumphs , seemed not to trouble Sukarno . Last week , in a 95-minute Independence Day speech , the <P> President made his own " New Life Movement " sound like nothing so much as a South Seas version of Red China 's " rectification " campaign . " Our nation , building itself anew , needs the support of a mental revolution , " declared Sukarno . " Mentally we must be completely rejuvenated-washed clean . " <P> The Boil . " Democracy without discipline , democracy without guidance has boiled over into anarchy . " he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Freedom that has not yet reached maturity will always be freedom for freedom 's sake . It always centers around freedom of the ego . " <P> Then Spellbinder Sukarno warmed up . " Start a mental revolution , " he cried . " Throw away all laziness , all egocentricity , all greed , all lawlessness , all degeneration , all luxury , all opportunism , all immorality . The year 1957 is our year of decision . Shall we survive or shall we perish ? We have come to the point of no return . As from this day let us launch the New Life Movement . Let us not meet it with cynicism , derision and ridicule . . . because , in truth , the intention is good . It is a movement to forge the Indonesian into a new man-purehearted , steelwilled , with the spirit of an eagle and a soul of fire ! " <P> <P> *Independence did not become fact until four years later .                  @ @ @
