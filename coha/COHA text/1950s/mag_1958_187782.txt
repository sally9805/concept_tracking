The famed sopranos give the Met its glamour , but its roster of first-class male singers provides the backbone . As box-office attractions , none of them can compare with a Callas or Tebaldi , and certainly not one of them commands the fanatical personal devotion Caruso once enjoyed . But their presence at the Metropolitan means the difference between a minor and a major opera house . Among the Met 's best men : <P> Mario Del Monaco , 39 , tenor , singing opposite Tebaldi in this week 's opening Tosca . Endowed with the most glorious top register in all opera , Del Monaco came to the Met in 1952 after serving in the Italian army and making his big-time debut at Covent Garden . Short , stocky and a shouter , Del Monaco commands ringing B-flats that have made a name for him in all the roles-Pagliacci 's Canio , Samson , Ada 's Radames-in which vocal volume , height and brilliance are needed simultaneously . His interpretation of Otello , by critical consensus , is the finest in present-day opera . <P> Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Brooklyn boy , Tucker sang as a cantor in the neighborhood synagogue , for years owned his own textile business , broke into the Met in 1945 with almost no previous operatic experience . He freely confesses his lack of acting talent , but under proper direction he has produced some fine dramatic characterizations , e.g. , Don Jos , Turiddu , Farrando in Cos Fan Tutte . He has a big , warm , sensuous tenore robusto . <P> Leonard Warren , 47 , baritone . Bronx-born Singer Warren was a runner in the garment district , studied advertising at Columbia , sang in the Radio City Music Hall chorus , won the Metropolitan Auditions of the Air in 1938 . A burly man ( 6 ft. , 218 Ibs. ) , he restricts himself largely to Verdian roles . His big , mahogany-hued voice is unmatched by any other baritone in the world . He virtually owns the role of Rigoletto , both vocally and dramatically . <P> Robert Merrill , 40 , baritone . Before he reached the Met in 1945 via the Auditions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borscht circuit , made a famous recording of The Star-Spangled Banner for Fox Movietone News ( from which he got the nickname " The Star-Spangled Baritone " ) , pitched a few seasons of semi-pro baseball . He still sings regularly in Las Vegas nightclubs , once explained his devotion to opera : " I 'd like to be a comedian , but their material wears out so fast . Me , I 've got the best writers in the world writing for me-guys like Verdi , Puccini , Bizet . " For all his clowning , Merrill is a deadly serious artist who uses his peculiarly suave , resonant and firmly centered baritone to excellent effect , particularly in the roles Warren neglects-Carmen 's Escamillo , The Barber Figaro , Don Carlo 's Rodrigo . <P> Cesare Siepi , 34 , bass . Born in Milan , Siepi started out to be a boxer , switched to singing during the war , was brought to the U.S. by the Met 's Bing . An excellent actor , he is particularly effective in the roles of such sorrowing old men as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won acclaim for his Don Giovanni and The Barber 's Basilio . His resonant , warm bass and trim good looks make him the leading contender for Ezio Pizza 's place .
