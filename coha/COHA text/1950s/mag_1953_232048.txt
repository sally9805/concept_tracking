In Chicago 's ornate Civic Opera House one day last week , Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson arose before 3,000 members of the American Farm Bureau Federation to talk about farm problems and policy . Just before he spoke , the " Deltones , " a girls ' trio from Delta County , Utah , sang " Santa Claus Is Comin ' to Town . " But Ezra Taft Benson made no effort to pose as a man with a snowy white beard and a bag full of gifts . <P> The farm situation , Benson bluntly admitted , certainly is not all Cadillacs and caviar . Since February 1951 , the prices farmers get have dropped 64 points ( from 313 to 249 ) on the Agriculture Department 's index . Prices that farmers pay for goods they buy ( including livestock feed ) did not begin dropping until May 1952 , and have dropped only 13 points . Most of the decline in farm prices occurred before the Eisenhower Administration took office , Benson said , but the farmer is still in the cost-price squeeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Department of Agriculture has been using and will continue to use " every tool at its command , " the Secretary said . As a result of its efforts , the Federal Government now owns or has made loans on $5 billion worth of farm products ; e.g. , it is holding 425 million bushels of wheat-enough to make five loaves of bread for every human being in the world-and has made loans on 764 million bushels of corn . The Government 's storage bill for all farm commodities is $465,000 a day . Asked Benson : " What are we going to do about it ? " <P> Answering his own question , Benson said that the Administration will soon come forward with a new program designed to " root out the bad points and strengthen the weaknesses . " He again avoided listing details of the program , but he left no doubt on two points : 1 ) he is against the present system of rigid price supports for basic farm crops at 90% of parity , because he thinks it encourages farmers to produce surpluses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is against price supports for livestock . <P> " You hog raisers know what happened to hogs last year , " said Benson . " They were selling for 16 a pound a year ago - only 77% of parity . There was some agitation for hog supports then . But Secretary Brannan at that time did n't think supports were feasible . . . What did farmers do when they knew there would be no price supports . . . ? You bred 12% fewer sows for spring farrow this year-5% fewer sows for fall farrow . And hog prices bounced back quickly . Some of you sold hogs here in Chicago this week for $24 . . . Does n't this make a pretty good argument that supply and demand will solve a particular farm problem faster than Government possibly can ? " <P> The Right Language . While Ezra Taft Benson has raised plenty of dust among some farmers with that kind of philosophy , he was talking the right language to the Farm Bureau , the largest ( 1,626,632 families ) farm organization in the U.S. For six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmer named Allan Kline , has been arguing for flexible price supports . Kline subscribes to the theory that farmers would gear their production to supply and demand rather than to Government bounty if support prices ranged from 75% of parity when a crop is in surplus to 90% of parity when it is scarce .
