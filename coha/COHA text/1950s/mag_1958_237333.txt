At Alabama 's Atmore prison farm , Jimmie Wilson , 55 , a Negro handyman , awaited the bell 's toll : he is under sentence to die in the electric chair next week . His crime : a $1.95 robbery . <P> Under Alabama law , robbery ( which , by definition , requires violence or a threat of violence ) can be a capital offense . In practice , the death penalty applies only to Negroes . Since 1927 , when Alabama started using the electric chair , four prisoners have been executed for robbery . All were Negroes . For various crimes since 1927 , Alabama has electrocuted a total of 22 whites , 124 Negroes . <P> One summer night a year ago , Jimmie Wilson , some moonshine under his belt , went to the back door of the home of Mrs. Estelle Barker , an elderly widow , in the dusty little town of Marion . As Wilson told it , he asked her to pay him in advance for some yard work he was supposed to do for her later that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Estelle Barker , a white woman , told the story , Wilson threatened her into giving him money . And after he pocketed the $1.95 , she said , he grabbed her and tried to ravish her . <P> Wilson 's court-appointed lawyer objected that Wilson was being tried for robbery , not intent to rape , and that Witness Barker 's obviously inflammatory testimony " infuriates the minds " of the jury . But the court overruled the objection , allowed Mrs. Barker to tell her story . That decision doomed Defendant Wilson .
