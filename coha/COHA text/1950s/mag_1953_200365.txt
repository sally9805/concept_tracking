THE RIVERS RAN EAST ( 366 pp. ) - Leonard Clark-Funk &; Wagnalls ( $5 ) . <P> <P> A stranger runs well-documented risks in the Peruvian jungleland east of the Andes . Some have had their heads lopped off and shrunken as trophies ; others have been eaten alive by ants ; still others have been emasculated like steers , fattened on oily berries and served up to cannibals . Leonard Clark of San Francisco is an experienced jungle man who risked these dangers to look for gold and lived to tell about it . In The Rivers Ran East , he has written one of the most rousing adventure yarns of the season . <P> Cannibal Country . Explorer Clark was fresh from an OSS career in the Far East when he flew to Peru in 1946 , in pursuit of a private postwar plan : he had heard of a man in Lima who had a treasure map . Sure enough , Clark found his man and paid him $100 for " a yellowed , badly cracked and very old Spanish parchment . " From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied by a Peruvian guide , he headed into the bush and six months of savagery . <P> The only path through the jungle was by river . Soon Clark reached a waterway , bought five Indian slaves , built a couple of rafts and launched into the heart of cannibal country . It was not long before flights of arrows from the river banks warned them of their welcome . Cornered one night , Clark and his men beat off raiding Indians hand-to-hand , killing five . But Indians kept after them . Clark and three others were later surrounded and captured , had to watch helplessly while one man was forced to swallow a blazing firebrand : " The smell of burning flesh filled the air . Finally . . . he was still and quiet . . . Thank God the man was dead . " Clark and the two others were saved for a banquet , but they escaped . The party had expanded along the way , but before they reached the settlement of Iquitos , seven had been killed , and Clark sent his malaria-stricken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clark finished his trip with a green-eyed American girl named Inez Pokorny , who was hunting gold and was stranded in Iquitos , too . Their quest almost ended prematurely one night when Clark was bitten by a poisonous snake , a nacanaca , and was only saved because his Indian paddlers went promptly to work with the native treatment : a brew of herbs injected near the wound by repeated jabs of a thorn . <P> In the end , Clark satisfied himself that he had found , on the banks of the Chiriaca River , a far western tributary of the Amazon , a reasonable facsimile of El Dorado . There , he traded all his spare equipment for 50 Ibs. of gold dust and nuggets sifted from the river gravel by friendly headhunters . On the journey out of the jungle , he and his companion were forced to bury about half the gold because it was too heavy to carry farther . Living comfortably in San Francisco now , Clark has never gone back to pick it up .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
