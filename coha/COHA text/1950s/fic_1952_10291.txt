 --  I told you so , she said . He may end by killing us both . The doorbell rang again ; and since she was mostly in the oven , he answered it . There was noise on the landing outside and actually banging on the door ; he guessed it must be the girls upstairs , old friends of Isobel 's . When he opened , he found six persons pacing the landing . Three girls  --  one a flaming Negress  --  and three young men were disporting themselves outside ; he knew they 'd already fortified themselvesbefore coming to his housewarming ; they were already in the messy lubrication and accepted bad manners of a clique.  --  Surprise , surprise ! they cried in unison , in prearranged heartiness.  --  Good evening , and welcome . I 'm David Murray .  --  No , you 're a cute operator , a smartly dressed dark girl said , shaking hands . I 'm Louisa.  --  And I was christened Meg , said a plump limp girl , alreadyfar gone with drink.  --  We thought there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even though you did n't invite her ... . The Negress marched right up and shook hands ; she was wearing a loud purple dress and a turban of cloth-of-gold.  --  It 's smart to crash parties , the Negress said . Everybody 's doing it ... . The crowd roared at the wit of the Negress , and David said softly :  --  That 's a new rule . I had n't heard it.  --  Honey , where you been ? Olivia screamed , and the clique rejoiced in David 's blushes . Louisa took over . Apparently they just loved standing out on the chilly landing and finding out just what this David Murray was like.  --  Now you must meet the boys . Shake hands with Tom Bernstein . He 's the real . . . shall I say . . . mentor of our crowd ? Tom 's drama critic for the Tribune . I hear you'rep101intellectual . So you should get along well with Tom , for he 's a genuine Jewish one . Much avant-garde . Much chichi ... The boy ' David was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernstein was both bald and hairy , lean and saturnine , looking rather like a cultivated orangutan . He disdained to shake hands , but muttered out of the corner of his mouth . Sophistication hung about him like peeling gilt :  --  Rum show , really .. . Then Meg did the honors ; she mumbled her words and did n't look at David , perhaps she was listening for the clink of ice from within :  --  This is my current sweetie , Dick Dobbs . He owns an antique shop with his mother . The sweetest old rockers and hooked rugs ! You must buy something quickly from Dick , for he needs trade to keep from starving , him and his poor old mother ... . Dick Dobbs was a scraggly young man with a full beard , who pointed like a bird dog . He shook hands with David in an overpowering clutch , and there was concealed in his palm one of those gadgets which give an electric shock , and David tottered against the banister . He looked anxiously for a boutonniere which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing only slacks and a filthy T-shirt , from under which ( it did n't meet his trousers ) leaked the spindly hair round his navel.  --  Ho-ho-ho ! said this personage . I 'm the last of the existentialists . And I 'd sell you Old Ironsides if I could ... . Meg , enraptured by such a display of wit , snuggled up to her lover , and Louisa did n't get a chance to present the third young man , who rushed upon David . He was dazzlingly dressed , pallidly beautiful , and had a levitatory air , as though at any minute he might rise off the ground . He stroked David 's hand in a fist as light as down :  --  Hello , you ! I 'm Harry Korchinski , a White Russian . Atp102present no one is speaking to me because I wo n't lend them any money . Shall we say I put my foot down ? Louisa chuckled and explained :  --  Yes , Harry is rich . And you know , his only interest in life , instead of settling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ballet ? ! God knows it 's chic , but he practices like crazy all day long . Mr Kubelik says he will cancel our lease if Harry practices any more leaps in our apartment ... . -O , so those were what that thumping was ! David said . For an answer Harry Korchinski let out a little scream  --  and leaped . His elevation was tremendous , and he bumped his head against the ceiling of the landing.  --  Why , you 're all welcome , David said . Do come in . But first , in a milling of voices , they insisted on presenting him with the gifts for his housewarming . They were cheap little knickknacks , exalted into something frightfully amusing by persons too niggardly to give a decent or a tasteful gift . Louisa produced a dozen glass swizzle sticks from Woolworth 's . Meg gave a furred cover for the toilet seat . Olivia gave a book of Negro poems printed on lavender paper . Tom Bernstein whipped out an old copy of the Kenyon Review . Dick Dobbs an exploding cigar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a set of cigarette lighters in Turkish shapes . Isobel met her old gang in the vestibule . David , loaded with their gifts and their wraps , was desirous of seeing how life with him had altered her ties with them . Many times she 'd described all six of them to him , labeling each as a unique personality . He observed that she was bussed by three women and three men . ( And he had never kissed his father , and rarely his mother . ) He could n't conceive of kisses as synonymous with handclasps.  --  Ho-ho ! cried Dick Dobbs , grasping Isobel 's waist . We 're back again , Izzy , and this time you 'll find it harder to shake us . Been in hiding , eh ?  |  --  David 's been initiated now , said Louisa . We want you to bring him up to see us at least once a day . On a leash.  --  Tomorrow morning , Tom Bernstein said to David , your phone will start ringing . We call each other steen times a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  We 'll thank you not to phone before noon , Isobel said . ( And David rejoiced that she took his part against them . ) The crowd exchanged suspicious glances ; they were wondering whether it was too early in the party to whittle David down to size . Olivia nudged him and whispered ; she meant to keep her turban on :  --  Do I understand correctly , David Murray , that no reference is to be made to the business between you and our Izzy ? He did n't answer , for he was frozen by her sniggering intimacy. -O , what gifties , cried Isobel . I see there 's one bunch that has n't lost its sense of humor ! He took the crowd 's wraps into the bedroom ; she , by some tacit division of responsibility , led her friends ' into the living room . It was an uncommon entrance , as those already drinking would testify to their dying day . It turned out that Harry was wearing ballet slippers ; he got up on his points and executed a leap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diana ! said Mrs Murray , spilling a little whisky on her gown.  --  If ya do n't watchya step , Fred said , disengaging himself from the dancer , I 'm gon na whompya.  --  My God , said Mrs Joy , here they come . And what a warm welcome they 've got for themselves !  --  All I 'll say is , Louisa put in briskly , is that we lead more interesting lives than some people of my acquaintance . Dick Dobbs , pretending to be a ghost , pulled his skivvy shirt over his head and butted into the room blind , with hisp104exposed navel for an eye . Father Rushton stood up , and Olivia put her hand over her mouth in mock chagrin :  --  A Beaux Arts Ball ! Why did n't I come as Aida ? ( For in the admiring shelter of the crowd , Olivia scorned to pass ' ; she was wealthy , she was accepted by whites ; so she 'd become virulently Negro : she wielded the race issue like a sword , even with people civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And she was chairwoman of every committee in town for the advancement of colored people . ) Since the only two people in the room who did n't know everybody were Mrs Murray and Father Rushton , Isobel did the introductions , and prettily too . David 's mother all but blinked on shaking hands with Olivia , but she did it with grace for one pre-1914 . Louisa did n't understand that it was n't Olivia 's color that offended Mrs Murray , but her arrogance . Meg sat on the floor by Fred and stole a sip of his drink ; she rubbed her cheek against his shoulder.  --  In the satchel as usual , he said , drawing away.  --  Why do n't you come up and see us more often , sweetie ? Meg asked , ready to cry.  --  I got my own friends . I do n't sit around all day and talk bout books I ai n't read.  --  Do you good , ducky ! Louisa barked . A relief from readingyour gasmeters.  --  That Louisa 's a fresh thing , Mrs Joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good living , and who is she to put on airs with her sixty-seven-fifty a week as a dress buyer ?  --  Sixty-eight , mummy dear , Louisa corrected.  --  None of us had met your son till tonight , Harry said sweetly to David 's mother . But she was afraid he might soar into the air again :  --  Well , it 's nice to make friends . Understand , I 've nothing against you all personally , but David did go with a different crowd when he was in college . Most of them are stockbrokersp105now . But I will say that you young folks who came in just now really get a kick out of life . In my day people were more subdued , and I 'm still not sure that inhibitions are n't a good thing for the individual and for society . Though I 'm not passing judgment , you understand . I think it 's a sign of old age when one starts criticizing the younger generation. - O , we 're all good kids , Harry said sweetly.  --  Indeed ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicated to Mrs Murray over the back of her hand :  --  They 're trash , no matter how polite you try to be ... . David 's mother shrugged , put on an air of slight martyrdom , as from one woman to another ; Isobel 's mother clucked and shook her head . Olivia proceeded to settle herself beside Mrs Murray on the couch , even pushing her a bit for room , and the older woman courteously made space.  --  Certainly you have no objections to my sitting next you , do you ? You 're not going to make a scene in your son 's house , are you ?  --  Good gracious , whatever made you think that ? Fred watched David 's mother and the Negress ; out of the corner of his mouth he said to Harry , who was seeking ballet music among the records :  --  Why does that dinge always carry a chip on her shoulder ? Harry was genteel enough , but he would rise to the defense of anyone in the crowd : -O , Olivia 's emancipated.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her race has suffered ... . Look , Freddie , why do n't you come for rides in my maroon convertible any more ?  --  Because ya got more money than 's good for ya , Harry . I got a job.  --  But you do n't have to read gasmeters if you do n't want to.  --  Nobody 's gon na keep me , Fred said . ( And each knew  |p106what  was referred to . Fred gave a flickering glance at his sister , passing hors d'oeuvres ; Harry sighed )  --  You might at least let me pay for ballet lessons for you . You 've got the build of a perfect dancer.  --  Nobody 's ever gon na see me swish through the air with the greatest of ease , like you did ten minutes ago ... . -O , you 're mean , Harry Korchinski said.  --  No , we 're playing in different innings , Harry . Mrs Murray said the alcohol made her dizzy , and Mrs Joy offered to guide her to the bathroom.  --  Ho-ho , said Dick Dobbs . Guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In the bedroom David happened to look up at the wall . Father Rushton had already been busy , for the picture of the Sacred Heart was hanging over the bed , where there 'd been a swan-necked lady of Modigliani . But he did n't bother to take it down now . Mrs Joy was knocking on the bathroom door and calling to Mrs Murray :  --  You all right , dearie ? Please hurry up , because my own bowels are in a turmoil.  --  Be out in a minute , Mrs Joy .. . On re-entering the living room , David noticed that Isobel , in avid conversation with Meg and Louisa , had n't yet served encores to the six newest arrivals :  --  Your friends have their tongues hanging out.  --  Well , hon , I thought this was your apartment ... .  --  I thought it was your party as well as mine . Get themdrinks . But that sloven named Meg has had enough already.  --  She can so have a drink in my house !  --  Your house ! Having a wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't had time to sit down yet ... . -O , you make me sick , David.  --  I thoughta bargain was a bargain . . . . Nevertheless , he made six fresh highballs and distributed  |p107them  . And he already knew the crowd so well that he could almost soothsay what each would say as he served them.  --  You could wait on me all your life , ducky , Louisa said.  --  Tee-hee . Me a lil inebriated , Meg said , slopping part of hers.  --  I wonder if I 'm welcome here , Olivia said . Your Lady Mother has an advanced case of racial discrimination ... .  --  Mother is simply pre-1914 , David said.  --  Feed it to me straight , Jackson , said Torn Bernstein in his affected baritone.  --  A prosit and a skoal and a ho-ho to you , Dick Dobbs said , wiping the mist on his glass with the edge of his skivvy shirt.  --  Tell me , lover , said Harry Korchinski , did you ever study the ballet ?  --  My piano keeps me busy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job accompanying at Arthur Murray 's !  --  Thanks . There 's a high percentage of suicides among pianists in ballet schools . One , two , three , entrechat .. . Mrs Joy was standing in the doorway , shifting from one foot to the other :  --  Young man , it may not be my place to say it here , butI think your poor Mom 's whoopsed in the Bobo ... . He went quickly down the corridor and listened at the door :  --  Mother , are you ill ? She came out immediately , very erect ; he guessed she 'd been merely bathing her temples , an old rite of hers when she was distraught : -O , I 'm quite all right , lamb . These young people made me a trifle nervous . . . . David , how they throw down your liquor ! May I be frank ? You 're head and shoulders above them all . . . . But that girl Isobel is a pretty , pleasant little thing . . . . But why not make friends at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clever . I think they 're phonies . Excuse me , have you some social obligation to them ? He was about to blurt that they were chums of Isobel 's , but he bit his tongue . Instead :  --  Well , one has to have people in sometimes , you know . Besides Meg and Louisa from upstairs have been very kind to me when I was setting up housekeeping . He almost said we and us , for now Isobel was everpresent in his pronouns.  --  I merely want what 's best for you , David , I hate to see you get entangled ... .  --  I have a free will , he said sharply . Is n't that what Holy Mother Church teaches ? She looked at him quaintly and sadly :  --  My son , sometimes I wonder if you 're in a position to say what the Church teaches and what She does not ... . Then she walked quietly back to the parlor , and Mrs Joy charged down the vestibule to take her turn . David looked after his mother with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he saw what folly it was to underestimate her intuition . As he walked musingly back to his living room ( where some of the guests were already in the shouting stage ) he heard a light tap at the door , which was repeated . He opened to discover Carmen S O'Brien , a picture hat over one eye , swaying a little . To placate him she held out her housewarming gift , a dozen table mats of indigo-tinted jute :  --  Hard day at the offish , she announced . Shold country eshtate . Fifteen pershent.  --  Why , that 's wonderful , Mrs O'Brien ! And thanks for your thoughtful present . She cocked her head toward the living room :  --  Shounds like a brawl . Well , guesh I 've come to the right place ! Then he remembered how they 'd got this house , and he began shaking her and whispering in her ear :  |  --  Listen carefully to me , you last of the romantics . Can you follow me ?  --  Yesh , dear . To the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and myself are here tonight . They do n't know yet that Isobel and I are married . Do you understand , you last of the romantics ? Will you keep our secret ? Do n't call her Mrs Murray tonight , only Miss Joy . Have you got that ?  --  Yesh , Mishter Murray . No Misshush Murray , only Mish Joy.  --  Correct . Do n't give us away , Mrs O'Brien , as you love real estate . He took her arm to the living room ; she was reeling slightly . Then a miracle happened . As soon as Carmen S O'Brien caught sight of Father Rushton , she was cold sober . She rushed across the room , straightening her hat , both hands out . David had never seen such a transformation ; it was as though he 'd poured ice water over her. -O , Father , Father ! What a spiritual tone you 're giving us !  --  I could have sworn you were spifflicated , said Louisa under her breath.  --  Meeeee ? Honey , I do n't consume one-eighth the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , Meg said dazedly . Isobel effected the introductions , though nearly everyone knew Carmen S.  --  You old bag , said Tom Bernstein in her ear . Sold any prefabricated houses lately ? ( David knew from Isobel that Tom and Carmen had once been lovers , like everybody else in the crowd , for Carmen S O'Brien preferred to consummate her deals in bed. )  --  Listen to that ! cried Mrs O'Brien to Father Rushton . Maligning me ! Is n't it true I make a good confession every Saturday afternoon , Father ?  |p110The  priest bowed . Mrs Joy , who had emerged from her session at the waterworks , whispered to Mrs Murray :  --  She 's another of them . Except that she makes money out of her shenanigans .. . Having sobered up in one second flat , Carmen S O'Brien was persuaded to put her lip around a highball glass . She told the room :  --  I take an occasional drink for sociability 's sake . In business I find it 's polite to consume alcohol in moderation ... . Out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S O'Brien 's lap ; she noticed it crawling midway through her second sip and let out a shriek :  --  Glory be to God , no ! None of the houses I handle has them . Take it away . Dick Dobbs put the toy back in his pocket :  --  Ho-ho ! Thought you 'd have to go on the wagon , eh , finally ?  --  I like a good practical joke myself , said Father Rushton , wiping his eyes . Harry Korchinski , who was n't getting much notice , came over and sat at the priest 's feet . He made much ado about collapsing gracefully at the waist.  --  Father , is it a sin that I love to dance ? The ballet has given me such supreme ecstasy that sometimes I feel guilty about it . Tell me it 's all right . A little Russian priest I know is a balletomane , but then he may be prejudiced ... .  --  Dancing is not in itself evil , my son ... .  --  ( They 'll all want him to make their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  And is the theater sinful ? Tom Bernstein asked . I know it 's held to be by Irish Puritans.  --  Moral drama is illicit , said Father Rushton . I myself like a good clean show on the legitimate stage.  --  Is it a sin to be colored ? demanded Olivia in her crackling voice.  |p111My  daughter , you know as well as I that Holy Mother Church has always led the vanguard against exploitation of any race , of any color ... .  --  Well , really , I never heard that , Olivia said disappointed . My grandfather was a slave and my mother was a shoutin Baptist . But I threw all that junk overboard . To coin a phrase , religion is the opiate of the people.  --  You 're only quoting Karl Marx , my daughter.  --  Well , he had lots of good ideas !  --  Hear , hear ! cried Louisa . ( She was engineering the conversation to this ; all her own parties ended this way. )  --  If my antique shop is sinful , said Dick Dobbs , then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peddle are at least as old as Christ , ho-ho.  --  There 's no need to blaspheme , my son.  --  They all ought to be ashamed of themselves , Fred Joy : old his mother . While Mrs Murray 's eyes were popping  --  she believed that only Communists baited priests  --  Mrs Joy leaned forward and boomed out :  --  You tell them where to head in , Father . Young people today have no respect for anything . Nothing is sacred any more . I 'd like to deal out a few boxes on the ear around this parlor . Gypsies , that 's what they are ; mockin their betters and blabbin bout things they do n't understand.  --  Holy Mother Church has weathered all storms so far . As he went out to get more drinks , David saw Louisa and Tom giggle at one another behind their hands . Still later when Isobel began to heat the plates , she sensed that David 's mother was behind her.  --  May I help , my dear ? I can see you 're very handy around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman.  --  Thank you , Mrs Murray . When David gives a party , I like to persuade myself I help him make it go.  --  You 're a very pretty girl , my dear . And my David seems  |p112reasonably  fond of you . You seem to know each other quite well ....  --  Well , we really do n't , Mrs Murray , you see .. .  --  Pardon me , my dear , but you do . I 've seen you exchange glances every so often . The sort of glances I used to exchange with my poor departed husband when we were giving a party . Though in my day young people did n't need alcohol so much . . . . Isobel , are you in love with my son ?  --  I . . . do n't think so , Mrs Murray.  --  Then is he in love with you ?  --  What a funny question ! I do n't think so . Isobel tried to mask the trembling of her hands . She knew that she 'd been watched for the past hour ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My dear Isobel , said Mrs Murray , never raising her voice . I beg you not to lie to me . I 'm fond of you , you see . But I have n't lived to sixty for nothing . No woman does . I am certain that you two are in love ... .  --  He 's an attractive boy , Mrs Murray . He could have any girl he wanted . I 'm sure many girls are gone on him . Those who 've seen him , have heard him play in concert , I mean ... .  --  My son will someday be a great pianist . It 's important that he find a woman who loves and understands him . Artists are more easily ruined than grocers.  --  I wonder if David is the marrying kind , Isobel said , riskinga smile to herself as she turned toward the cupboards.  --  I wonder if that 's the proper observation for you to make , my dear .... You do n't wish me to help you in this kitchen ? Do you fancy this kitchen as already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the girl cooking up a tasty meal for her young man , just to show him what a homemaker she is ?  --  You misjudge my motives , Mrs Murray . I 've already preparedseveral dinners for David . ( Approximately thirty-two , she thought. )  --  Still , said David 's mother , leaning against the refrigerator ,  |p113you  're setting up a train of association in his mind . If he sees you frequently enough in his kitchen , he will come to considerthat it 's the rightful place for you . . . my dear , permit me to tell you that you use too much condiment . When David was a boy , he hated spices ... .  --  Well , he likes them now , Mrs Murray . . . . You forget that the girls of today are different from your own generation . We do n't think so calculatingly of marriage today . We like the company of boys , to be sure , but I think we 're a little less tense about the right match ' than you were ... . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so naive .... May I have a glass of cold water ? I 'm not used to drinking whisky ... . Isobel took out a bottle of drinking water that was standing in the refrigerator , next to the freezing coils ; Mrs Murray drank it slowly.  --  Only a woman would think of such a thing , she said vaguely.  --  I ca n't decide whether you approve of me or not , Mrs Murray . I suspect that you do n't . Would you automatically dislike any girl that David was friendly with ? The mother set down the water glass on the white top of the refrigerator ; for her now it symbolized the chill expanse of the young woman 's mind . Then she came and stood next to Isobel , and something overly kind in her voice put up the guards further :  --  As woman to woman , my dear , I 'd prefer that David saw more of you . On that other crowd in there I sha n't pass judgment .. .  --  You 're overestimating David and underestimating them , Mrs Murray . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But mothers are the blindest of people . . . .  --  It 's unkind of you , my dear , to say it . When you become a mother ( and I pray to Our Blessed Mother that some day you will , with a fine husband ) , you may have reason to speakp114out of the other corner of your mouth . You 'll find that a woman does n't live until the children she has brought forth in pain and sacrifice cause her gratuitous sorrow ... . Both touched and embarrassed , Isobel faced Mrs Murray squarely for the first time :  --  Ha-ha , believe me , I have no desire to start breeding right off . And that attitude of almost hoping that your children will hurt you seems to me like an Indian fakir who likes to lie down on his bed of nails ... .  --  My dear , you 're too modern for your age . Tell me , do you pray often ? -O , quite often , Mrs Murray , oftener than you 'd think , what with my modernity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Anyway , said Mrs Murray , taking Isobel 's arm , let us remember one another in our prayers .... What do you do for a living , my dear ? Isobel thought quickly , remembering her mother 's diatribe earlier :  --  Ha-ha , I 'm afraid I just float . My father left me a little something , you see , that even my mother ca n't touch ... .  --  You should have a job , my dear ... . Isobel thought that she already had a full-time one , but she only smiled her sweetest , knowing that she was dismissing the older woman , as at the end of a royal audience , for this was her house :  --  I 'm glad we talked , Mrs Murray.  --  I 'm glad we did too , my dear , said Mrs Murray , catching the hint in midair . We understand each other a little better , I think . Will you come to tea at my house next week ? And David 's mother , smiling mysteriously to herself , went back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was listening . Father Rushton was nursing his second sherry , with a Jesuitical pretense that it was a rare vintage , instead of Isobel 's cooking wine . The rest of thep115party was in gaseous explosion , it being David 's theory that one should paralyze with alcohol unpleasant guests , and the sooner the better . Louisa was playing to the hilt her favorite role , as arbitress of brilliant conversation ; she was propoundingsocially minded topics and moderating the discussion , as at a town meeting . She had taken off her shoes and was reclining on the sofa , putting on a roguish show for David , as she always did the first time she met an eligible young man ; she looked at him out of her brilliant black eyes for confirmation and applause . Mrs Joy had already had four highballs and was beginning to nod ; there was a stain of bourbon on her bold bosom  --  Susan B Anthony is on the loose , she said sleepily to Mrs Murray , who sat down beside her.  --  I 've been chatting with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more chattin than I 've got time to give her . O , Mrs Murray ( she sobbed a little ) , there 's some as say I 've let my kids run wild . But earnin my daily bread , I had to let Nature take its course . But I did at least install a juke box in our livin room , so 's they could have their friends in to jitterbug ... .  --  I 'm sure you 've done all you could , Mrs Joy . And I also approve of your son Fred . He 's quieter than anybody in this room .... The fat woman looked over to where Isobel 's twin brother sat atop a lowboy , tranquilly drinking and watching the others , with a species of rough compassion , and her eyes welled over behind her spectacles :  --  Freddie 's the spittin image of his father when I married him . But Poppa got fat before he passed on . And Mrs Murray , what a man he was ! Why , I'da conceived if he hung his pants in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and wiped her mouth . Dick Dobbs had put his bifocals up on his forehead so that he looked like a zany schoolmaster ; out of the treas/ury of his pockets he 'd taken a cuckoo bird and wound it up ; it scampered over the rug and between the legs of the drinkers , pecking at their shins and making Swiss noises . ( His success at any party depended on the number of gadgets he fished from his pockets ; he even had a tie that lit up in the dark . ) Mrs Murray turned to Mrs Joy :  --  Did you know David had a twin brother ? Teddy . But I lost him at eighteen . Polio.  --  The knocks us mothers take , said Mrs Joy , venturing to pat her arm.  --  You 're a kind woman , Mrs Joy . Kinder than most of the young people in this room.  --  And how life has taken it outa me , said Mrs Joy , wiping her eyes . With his third drink Harry Korchinski had twined himself into the most supple knots to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned over and whispered to David :  --  By the bye , did n't I see a Mr &; Mrs sign on your mail-box ?  --  Protection against call-girls , David said quickly.  --  Well , you ca n't blame my being curious . I 've heard you play in concert , and several times I was within an inch of coming down here and asking you out for a ride in my red convertible , but the Weird Sisters ( indicating Meg and Louisa ) told me not to disturb you . But I 'm big enough to understand ; I was n't born yesterday . I understand this sort of menage , you know ; it 's called a Boston Marriage . And it 's none of my business ... .  --  Harry darling , please , said Isobel , putting a canape into his mouth . . . - O , sorry , sweetie . . .  --  You know , doll , Harry went on to David , Meg there ... Meg , sweetie , wake up , you 're snoring ! . . . Meg is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm too rich to have psychoses . My father 's father was a prince or something at Nijni Novgorod before 1917 . But I 'm full of them . That 's why I dance , I suppose . But I can talk to Meg , and I ca n't to most girls . And the things I tell her ! You might almost say she psychs me and I psych her ... . Meg , who had been crooning sleepily to the subdued strains of the phonograph  --  a witty showtune put on by Isobel to calm the party down before they supped  --  opened her eyes and winked once at Harry :  --  Ah , sweetie , the things you tell me ! And , still sitting , she did a Charleston shimmy , her hands behind her head . Evidently she 'd never recovered from Wellesley twenty years ago  --  the raccoon coats , the hip flasks . It was observable too that Meg was no little involved with Dick Dobbs ; she breathed heavily for his skivvy shirt . But David had a suspicion that Dick was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turbaned Negress , for his toys all ended their run at her sandaled feet , with their onyx toenails. - O , you are amusing , Dick , Olivia purred . Later tonight , if you coax me , I might make you a bouillabaisse at my place.  --  Ho-ho ! I 'm glad this is the season for oysters !  --  Yo makin fun of lil ole me ... . After a few drinks Olivia lapsed into skittishness and her mammy 's ' accent . ( Isobel had told David that at Olivia 's own parties , frequented by upper-class Negroes and singers and left-wing poets , she was accustomed to change her costumeat least three times , hostessing it in the grand manner of an Old South that had exploited her and hers. )  --  Lovely party , Mrs Murray said tentatively to Mrs Joy , who was also beginning to nap from the liquor.  --  Well , yes , Mrs Murray , out of all due politeness to your boy . But in my day ( as in yours ) things were simpler . We just sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical chairs . I just do n't follow all the jabber at these parties . I get the feeling these young folks are talking a private language ... .  --  Something . . . sinister ? murmured Mrs Murray , who had often had the same feeling of helplessness.  --  You may say that , dearie , said Mrs Joy , shutting her eyes again . And Father Rushton watched , watched , watched . And Louisa was holding a conversation in which she did n't propose to be interrupted for the world . She was goading Tom Bernstein and the priest into heady discussions of the Church , the theater , and the welfare state . The frivolity of her profession as buyer for rich and silly women had goaded her New England conscience into an excessive concern for the welfare of people she did n't know , and would n't like if she did know , since they were unwashed and poorly dressed  --  a crime in Louisa 's professional eyes . The more Louisa 's salary at the department store went up , the more she felt spurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David had been watching the rancor between Tom Bernstein and Louisa ebb and flow , that soured understanding between two ex-lovers . Louisa was just beyond her bloom ; he guessed that five years ago she must have been to Tom a musky mistress , with all the libertine jollity that is usually imputed to an artist 's model.  --  Torn , Duckie , Louisa said . Do n't you ever tire of being sententious ?  --  The young man has something to say , said Father Rushton.  --  Well , Father , when you 've been listening to his blather for years , as I have . . . But Tom 's studied baritone drawled on , like an actor fearful of having his cue jumped :  --  I appeal to you , padre . What gets me about the Church is that it 's such damn good theater . ( I understand that damn  |p119is  not offensive to Catholics as long as it does n't have for subject the Deity. )  --  The Mass is the greatest drama in the world , my son . But it 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his subject ; he was wearing a lapelless jacket of fawn-colored suede ; he had an ascot with a stickpin at his throat ; his shoes were also of suede :  --  Well , what I mean is , the Church has provided herself with a first-rate scenario . Of course she ought to have ; she 's had rehearsal time enough , unlike most Broadway shows , what with rising production costs . And look at the cast of characters , padre ! . . . The Son of God Himself ( I believe that 's the Christian interpretation of Jesus Christ ) .. . Mrs Murray and Mrs Joy , as they had been taught to do , bowed their heads with Father Rushton.  --  . . and three priests in Gothic vestments , and Gregorian showtunes that have lasted six hundred years , and pretty choirboys in red and white , and best of all , an audience that packs the house every Sunday morning , with a willing suspensionof their disbelief , which is something you rarely get in the theater . Yes sir , God the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a longer run.  --  Father Rushton may find your analogy embarrassingly secular , said Louisa , winking at David.  --  Not too much so , my daughter . Holy Mother Church seizes on any metaphor that will serve to explain Her message to generation after generation of converts.  --  Who 's talking of converts ? Louisa laughed rudely . I 'm a Socialist , if not something even farther to the left . And , Father , I do n't think you 'll find a convert in this secondstringdrama critic . Mrs Joy heaved up from the chair and tottered from the room.  --  Everyone here is just a little bit too independent for their own salvation !  |p120Her  son and daughter jumped to her assistance and helped her down the corridor . A moment later , Isobel , pale with rage , went back to her mysteries in the kitchen . Fred came over and in his shy way got David 's ear :  --  Gee , dopey , I 'm awfully sorry . Mom 's passed out and I put her on ya bed . Hope ya do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathe her forehead with cold packs , said Mrs Murray , rising too.  --  You 'd better bathe everyone 's , said Carmen S O'Brien . That 's what the world needs , an icepack . For half an hour she 'd been working into her second tight of the day , and talking to herself . Now she was reciting from memory the lyrical prose of a prospectus she 'd written for the Chamber of Commerce , on the delights of establishing a laundromat in the West End . Isobel was sobbing slightly in the kitchen ; David sneaked in and put an arm about her.  --  My mother did this to me on purpose , she said , banging the oven door. -O , she 's a rare old harridan , hon !  --  If that word means what I think it means , no supper for you , David Murray ! Since the other denizens of Fruit Street Alley were rubberingin at their vocal party , he drew the drapes on their traverse rod.  --  Then the theater , Tom Bernstein was saying , is only the worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my son , said Father Rushton patiently . That 's a famous heresy . Do n't ever assume that the arts are a form of religion . It 's one of the great delusions of your generation . It leads to the pitfalls of estheticism.  --  Ho-ho ! Dick Dobbs said . That 's the first time I ever saw you lose the last word . Carmen S O'Brien , to David 's dismay , had filled her own glass in the kitchen , with what looked like straight bourbon.  |  --  I know my hostie-wostie would n't mind . Your wife said .. .  --  Make yourself at home , Mrs O'Brien , he said quickly , grateful that the two mothers were out of the room . Carmen S recalled what she was and was n't to say , and rushed into the conversation like a drowning oarsman :  --  What the Church has is good salesmanship . . . . O , I wish I 'd been born a man ! By now I 'd have been a monsignoror something ! Louisa was thinking that people never scintillated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheming how to go about inviting Father Rushton to their next party.  --  There are some people , said Carmen S O'Brien darkly as the bourbon in her glass , who believe that a businesswomanca n't be a good Catholic . Well , let me tell you all that Our Lord would n't have driven me from the temple , for I 'm no Jewish moneychanger . In fact I 'm doing a corporalwork of mercy every time I sell a house or rent an apartment . Even Our Lord would have found me handy , because if I remember rightly , He had no place to lay His Head . Well , I 'd have found Him a place in sixty seconds flat ...  --  Talk is cheap , Fred joy said . ( In company he always experienced a sense of suffocation . He was wishing himself in some bar , watching the hockey game on television . ) Mrs Murray came back into the living room with ice water still dripping from her wrists ; she came over to Isobel :  --  I think you 'd better go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . She went , surprising David by her meekness to his mother . Fred followed her . They found an acrid smell in the bedroom : their mother was lying on the bedspread in the midst of her vomit . Her bulk on the mattress surpassed that of Isobel and David , when they lay together . In the dim light Mrs Joy was weeping stertorously.  |  --  Ah , Mom , Fred said , taking her hand . Ya know ya ai n't used to guzzlin ... . But Isobel switched on the lights , violating the privacy of the mess :  --  How dare you ! Are n't you ashamed ! And who 's going to pay the dry cleaning bill for this bedspread ?  --  Hush your mouth , Fred said , striking her gently on the nape of the neck . Ya talking to ya Mom ... . Mrs Joy sat up on the fouled bed ; hairpins had been shed from her gray hair . She spoke softly through her hiccoughs : -O , I 'm onto you , my pretty ! Stayin with ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doin in the chest of drawers ? And allya clothes in the closet ? Answer me that , my virtuous whore of a daughter !  --  So you searched this room ? Isobel said . You 'd no business to ... . - O , I did right to throw you out , my beauty . If you do n't play the trollop with one , you 'll play it with another ... .  --  Mom , please , Fred said . Isobel went to the bathroom , got a face cloth , and wiped her mother 's mouth and dress . She did it roughly , and the voice kept coming from under the damp cloth :  --  Ah , how many times I washedya face when you was a little girl , and you 'd fell down and hurt yaself playin ! Better you 'd broken your head then , than come to this ! O , a great lady you are !  --  I suppose you got drunk to celebrate my downfall ? Together they helped their mother to her feet , and they saw that she 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayin for both of yez . But Freddie would never do this to his Mom . But then he 's a man , and ya never can tell what a man is up to . It 's the woman who pays , and her sin shows all over her , like the stripes on a zebra . The brother and sister stripped the bed , and when their  |p123mother  was somewhat cleaned up , they let her lie down in it again . She closed her eyes and hiccoughed :  --  If there was some place else to lie , I would n't be lyin here . And I been thinking about that poor mother of your young man 's . But never a word will she hear from me . It would break her heart.  --  That 's kind of you , Isobel said . You 've already caused enough trouble here tonight.  --  I 'll stay withya , Mom , Fred said , holding her hand.  --  You 're my boy , Freddie . I think I 'll sleep a little . Then I 'll go home . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door on them . There was a taste of bile in her mouth and she felt old and tired . But she went through her routine , that she 'd planned for a week . In the tiny dining room she set the table for the buffet supper and lit the candles on the damask tablecloth , though David had told her that candlelight would be intolerably cute , and a tear fell on the stacked napkins . From the kitchen she carried platters of fried chicken and lobster salad ; allocated bowls of vegetables ; wrapped hot rolls in the casserole . Then she washed her face before announcing supper . In the living room , weary of the drinking and the chatter , Mrs Murray decided that the young had had their day long enough ; she leaned forward in her chair , just as she used to lecture her twins at her knee :  --  None of you has really tried to get acquainted with me , you know.  --  Why , we all think you 're a perfect old dear , Louisa said , determined that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Harry Korchinski said , jumping at her in a way she wished he would n't . You 're like my own mother . A little fussy and old-hat , but such fun !  --  Mothers are on the way out , let 's face it , Madam Murray , said ToM Bernstein.  |  --  In fact , I did my own in , Dick Dobbs said . I put strychninein her cambric tea , the old darling , when I was still in high school . When I was old enough to get my own breakfast and Lux my undies , I did n't need her any more . Mrs Murray was feeling her few drinks and the squalid spectacle of Mrs Joy in the bedroom.  --  You should have been spanked , she murmured , wiping away a tear.  --  Well now , no one believes me , said Carmen S O'Brien , but I have several kiddies . But do n't think that my career as a businesswoman invalidates my career as a mother . Do n't even hint at it , Mrs Murray ... .  --  And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that women live to be older than men . We all have our crosses . I , as a member of a persecuted minority .. . David 's mother wiped her eyes again :  --  Yes , you all have your causes . Racial tolerance . Birth control . Socialism . You take up fads because you have no religion.  --  Hear , hear ! said Father Rushton ( for Meg was snoring ) .  --  I have no cause , Mrs Murray continued , and I have no ax to grind . I suspect a lot of you younger girls look down on me . It is n't smart to have children any more , especially big Irish Catholic families . Well , let me tell you this : you would n't be so neurotic if you married and settled down . I suppose you all look upon me as a breeding cow because I 've done precisely what I came into the world for  --  besides the salvation of my soul . I have produced . Sons . You would n't have so many irrelevancies to chatter about if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the mothers of this world who make the trouble . It 's the people who have nothing to do , one way or another.  --  I should n't care to bring babies into this modern world , Louisa cried , shaking her glass ( prettily , she thought ) at David.  |  --  Then you might as well die , my dear . The world has always been the same , as bright or hopeless as you want to make it . 1 guess you 're what they call a defeatist.  --  There has to be a division of work , said Olivia . Let some women have the babies ; let others fight the causes ... .  --  My dear Olivia , said Mrs Murray . It is not the function of women to do the battling . Half the trouble in the world stems from the fact that modern women want , with a chip on your shoulder ....  --  Hear , hear , said Meg , coming awake.  --  You 're just hopelessly nineteenth century , Olivia murmured , preening her turban.  --  And proud of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was born in the nineteenth century . What would you have me be , twenty-first century ? David was wondering when Isobel would announce supper ; everybody had had too much to drink . And he was both proud of , and embarrassed at , his mother . He never knew how much she 'd given him : and here she was , holding her own against the crowd . Olivia said :  --  I 'd be proud to have you as chairwoman on one of my committees of inspection in colored slums.  --  Thank you , my dear . But I was n't trained for that sort of thing . I was trained to be a mother and a wife . At sixty I think I have the right to dispose of my time as I desire . I think I 've earned my right to tranquillity , tranquillity as I interpret the word ... . David observed that everyone except Father Rushton was blushing . They were prepared to discuss anything clinically , but the merest breath of truth or emotion silenced them . They sheltered this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Isobel and her brother appeared in the doorway ( she  |p126looked  worn and sad ) , and she put a vulgar shrillness into her voice :  --  Soup 's on ! Tuck in your bibs , kids ! Dick Dobbs scrambled to his feet ; he even went so far in formality as to tuck his underwear inside his trousers :  --  That 's what I came for !  --  And I could nibble at a lark or two , Tom Bernstein said . Isobel held back the male members of the crowd , for they were about to stampede the buffet . David was grateful to her for the adroit way in which she admitted his mother and Father Rushton first.  --  It looks simply lovely , my dear , said Mrs Murray , squintingin the candlelight . Isobel heaped a plate high , and brought it to David 's mother.  --  My dear , said Mrs Murray . It smells scrumptious . But is n't this fried chicken next to the lobster salad ?  --  Yes , Mrs Murray . I 'm famous for my fried chicken . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't today Friday ? -O , my God , it is , David said to himself . ( And he remembered , and he believed his mother and the priest knew , that he and Isobel lay abed every Sunday morning , during Mass. )  --  How could I possibly have forgotten ? cried Isobel . ( David had never seen her flush before. )  --  My daughter , Father Rushton said . I 'm sorry , but I ca n't eat your fried chicken , excellent as it is , on a Friday . The crowd had descended on the candle-lit table , jostling and laughing . Louisa , who had served Father Rushton , turned away to stoke her own fires . Meg was fully awake now , and was munching with snorts of transport . Only Harry Korchinski hung back . Tom Bernstein and Dick Dobbs were heaping their plates and telling the girls not to make such sows of themselves.  |  --  Father Rushton and I must be leaving , really , said David 's mother. -O , no ! said Isobel . You know , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liturgical calendar , my dear , his mother said , giving her a pitying look that left no doubt in David 's mind . He got his mother 's and the priest 's coats from the bedroom , not letting them hear the snoring of Mrs Joy . At the door Isobel groped for Mrs Murray 's hand :  --  I really do n't know what to say.  --  Better not say anything , my dear . But remember the invitation to tea with me next week . Father Rushton took David aside :  --  My son , reread your Hound of Heaven . ' Because I 'm going to shadow you and follow you like that . You may even find me sitting on your doorstep ... .  --  Thanks for coming , Father ... .  --  My lamb will perhaps remember how solicitous I was , said Mrs Murray , to see that he ate fish on Fridays . ( She shrugged , almost gallantly . ) But it 's so easy to forget , is n't it ? The door closed on them ; Isobel and David exchanged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their guests , who had carried their plates to the living room , and were eating rapaciously , uttering little complimentary cries on Isobel 's cookery . She was attempting not to cry.  --  Now that the Holy Ghost and Mrs Grundy have taken off , said Louisa with her mouth full , we can take down our hair , ca n't we , duckies ?  --  Were you referring to my mother ? David asked . Meg waved a hot roll at him : -O , relax , sweetie ! You 're one of us now . Do n't be a killjoyall your life . Olivia tested her salad for garlic :  --  The reason the world is the way it is today is because  |p128older  folks hate to give up their control of it . They hate us youth . Fred Joy spoke up for the first time in the evening :  --  Yeah ? I do n't think it would be any better if one of you was runnin the show . Every mouthful of the fine fried chicken and the delicate lobster salad was like lye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ten minutes past . Yes , she was truly at home with her crowd . And he murmured righteously to himself that he had come downhill since that night at Mickey 's . She had stifled something discriminating in him ; the bare fact that he was keeping her had caused him to fall into the hands of people such as these . When they 'd finished stuffing themselves , the crowd put their plates and napkins on the floor ; they dusted the remnantsof their cigarettes into the cooling greasy traces of Isobel 's feast . He began to carry off the plates , even though she gave him a warning glance . Evidently in her attic days it had been fashionable to take coffee surrounded by garbage . Fred got up and helped ( the only one who made a move ) ; their hands touched as they scraped the plates into the refuse can.  --  Do n't let them getya down , dopey . When they go , let 's you an me get drunk together.  --  She has made me a prisoner in this house , David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what didya think ya was gettin into ? Sis is flighty , but she 's also a mighty steely character ... . Isobel came into the kitchen with two hectic spots in her cheeks.  --  What 's the idea of clearing off that way ? Are you hintingthat my friends get out ?  --  Your friends , but my house . What demon whispered you to serve meat on Friday ?  --  I said I forgot , did n't I ? You pompous fool , you !  |  --  Sis , Fred said . Sis .. . And David took a plate from the sink and shattered it on the floor ; but he did n't lift his voice :  --  That for your crowd ! She instantly obliged by breaking another against the refrigerator.  --  For the rest of the evening , she said , I 'm going to have some fun . ' We 're going upstairs to Meg and Louisa 's . I 'll probably get good and stinking . You need n't come if you do n't want to . But you 'd better lend us some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it anyway . The crowd milled into the tiny kitchen , mewing and gigglingover the shards of china . Dick Dobbs possessed himself of two virgin bottles of bourbon , though David , purple , was debating the possibilities of swinging on him.  --  I 'll pay you for them , lover , Harry Korchinski whispered.  --  Come up to our place , Louisa said . Your old Aunt Louisa will show you how to throw a brawl . You 're nice , but you 're a bit stiff yet .... Or come up for Sunday breakfast .... So they made an exodus upstairs ; Isobel leading the way with burning eyes , though she was jesting the loudest of any.  --  And thanks for everything ! the crowd called back . David piled the remainder of the plates in the sink . Fred helped in his silent dispatching way ; he even put on Isobel 's apron.  --  After I take Mom home , dopey , I 'll come back and takeya out . Just like we usedta.  --  No.  --  You 're in deep , Fred said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if ya do n't wan na be helped . Mrs Joy came in dressed for the street ; she looked like a huge sick pale mummy.  --  Ready , Mom ? Fred asked , taking her arm and winking at David.  |  --  Ready as I 'll ever be , I suppose . Now if the young man will be so kind as to give me taxi fare home .. .  --  Nah , we 'll go in the subway , Mom ... .  --  We 're going home in style , Mrs Joy said , holding out her hand . If I puke at somebody 's party , I certainly deserve to be sent home , do n't I ? Feeling worse than sick , David laid a bill into her palm , where it was crisp among the proud-flesh and the rings . Then he saw Mrs Joy and Fred to the door.  --  I can hear that bitch upstairs , laughin among all the other tramps . I 'll give you a piece of advice , young man . Anybody who takes on us Joys bites off more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bigger than life .. . He leaned over the balustrade until their footfalls died in the alley 's snow . Then there appeared from nowhere Mr Kubelik , looking odd , washed and in a presentable suit :  --  Plenty of noisssse in your house tonight . My vife vanted I should call the police , but I said : Mamma , let the kids haff fun.  --  We had a party , David said , annoyed to find himself the tenant on the defensive.  --  Vere 's your vife ? the landlord asked with a moist smile.  --  Upstairs at another party.  --  Nell , veil ! I 'm goingk up and haff a liddle drink vid dem . Ah , Mr Murray , she 's a deffil , your vife ! David went into the bedroom and packed his bags . As , laden , he walked up Fruit Street Alley , he heard screams of pleasure from Meg and Louisa 's : everyone was dancing , including , he supposed , Mr Kubelik ; their interlocked shadowsfell on the snowy window shades . And his valises were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way , or on precisely that night . I 'd hoped we 'd have malicious talk after our party , dishing our guests the way long-married couples do , and deciding that none of them was worth sharing our island of love . We would have ( I 'd planned ) cleaned up the litter , had one more drink , and gone to bed secure in the knowledge that our love was a thing for us , outside all else . But the party took a turn from its inception , horrider than anything I could have imagined , and at its end I experienced a species of feminine withdrawal , something like what makes small boys run away from home . Certainly even earlier I 'd chafed under my bonds ; but waking in the mornings , with Isobel beside me , sleeping the sleep of trust , what I did possess seemed more real to me than going out into the world again , to seek another household , and another love . Even had she treated me decently that evening of the party , I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three months . I had n't broken the news to her that my agent had booked me for a concert tour of the East . But I left her without a cent in the desk drawer . I was planning , perhaps , to starve her out . She would have to leave that little house . I would go on paying from afar by check the rent and the light and the gas . So I imagined that when Isobel had eaten what was left in the refrigerator and in our larder , she 'd scrounge off Meg and Louisa 's for a while , then move back to her mother 's . Thus the rages between lovers are more scathing than vendettas between enemies . They are capable of whatever  |p134atrocity  when they consider themselves hurt or deceived , never considering the odd fact that in fights between lovers , nearly always , both are responsible . From the analyses of my adolescence , in those days when my skin was eaten by acne , and none of my contemporaries , boy or girl , would look at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I came to know myself in my ostracism . I was more reserved than most Americans . I hated scenes of any kind . I never spoke to anyone I had n't been introduced to . I did not believe that conversation consisted of argument . I was incapable of swapping casually the time of day , in fact I could n't even force myself to make small talk . These conventions of mine had made me a young man different from Isobel 's crowd . In the loneliness imposed from fourteen to seventeen ( when I wanted to conform and could n't ) I had set myself a standard of excellence inconsistentwith the sloppy mediocrity of our republic . But I was as stern in the judgment of myself as in that of others . I knew at fifteen I 'd never be a Nice Guy or a Good Joe . There were too many things I simply could n't put up with or excuse . My earliest disagreements with Isobel were rooted in money . I 'd been used to it during my life , and she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extravagances into a pinchpenny , for I could never find out where our money went . She 'd cry and promise to keep account books , but at the first of every month , our finances were a shambles . Some people find this sort of life idyllic ; I did n't . Through some gene of my bourgeois inheritance , I grew up with the idea that financial mismanagement is as capital as murder : small sums bothered me more than big ones . Isobel had always been broke ; I 'd have died rather than live off anyone  --  man or woman . All of which means that I 'd never become truly reconciled to keeping Isobel . An accountant probably could tot up that in the running of our little house and sleeping with me , shep135was worth every cent I paid out . But the Anglo-Saxon nature revolts at the thought of love being tied in with shekels . Romantic , it forgets that love , after the first few beddings , hangs on a house of one 's own , well-cooked meals , and companionshipout of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same language , but I was convinced that we loved each other . So I left her after that party . And I allowed myself one last spurt of hatred : I took a carving knife and sheared off the telephone cable in a place she would never notice . And I got on the midnight for New York ; I expected remorse to set in before the train pulled out , but it did n't . In the past when I was angry with Isobel , some of her unruly charm would always intrude and conquer my pettishness . But that night none of her sweetness , only her petty uglinesses  --  foreverstealing the better pillow on our bed , her temper when she insisted that we always go to bed together , at the same time , her criminal misuse of money . No , I began to think of her as a slut I 'd picked up , who 'd received more than her due . Indeed I was so sulphurous that I went into the club car and drank my way to New York ; and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no sorrow like my sorrow . Before I fell asleep in my hotel room , I called my apartmentto tell Isobel to pack and get out at once , but I had the pleasure of hearing the operator respond that the phone seemed to be out of order . And I wondered whether she was in our bed at all , or better yet , had invited one of the males of the crowd down to pass the night with her . My recital at Town Hall was a succes fou . A piano recital has always struck me as absurd : a man in white tie and tails beating eighty-eight keys before an audience in a hall . The piano is an intimate instrument ; to put it on a stage is like throwing a trout into the Pacific Ocean . But my agent had chosen well : at 5:30 on a Sunday afternoon I was a small king in New York . For my audience of elegants I offered ap136program that to them would be chic , without even a nibble of Chopin or Schumann  --  Stravinsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shattered by the interval  --  never a melody , nothing but dissonance ; ostinati , and sheer hideousness of sound . Then for the second half I went classic ( and it was lost on no one that the moderns had come first ) ; I played 24 of the Well-Tempered Clavichord , and ended with the Scriabine Etude I was practicing the day I 'd met Isobel . I read my reviews in a Lexington Avenue Bar , having given my agent the slip ; he 'd taken me to Toots Shor 's for dinner and was burbling , as agents do , about pahhhhties . I wanted to be alone . Virgil Thomson said I was a mere two steps below scaling Parnassus . Olin Downes gave a column to my involuted transversal of the modern bacchantes . And B H Haggin , with many crotchety phrases and Jamesian dodgings , allowed that I shaped certain phrases almost with the plasticityof a De Sabata . So I got tight and ended up by playing Mozart in the village at 4 A.M.I 'd decided to get Isobel out of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infidelities . Musicians have always had a sexy reputation with the public , and pianists , especially young American ones , with their hair cut and their fingernails clean , can out-Liszt Liszt . I had no trouble at all , especially since I was the dernier cri of the keyboard . In the three months I was away from the West End , I had anyone I wanted from Portland to Atlanta . It was possibly the last rampage of my youth . I wrote weekly to my mother , never giving her my latest address . Till spring I moved in circles even more odious to me than Isobel 's crowd . I seemed to attract them by my sneer , for people who pass as sophisticated are drawn  --  if not by the ugly and the grotesque  --  at least to people who have no use for them . Thus I tormented Jewish poetesses , with their fashionable psychoses and their devotion to little magazines. 136p137I doted on the bright young men , subsecretaries and vicedirectorsat the Museum of Modern Arts . My special target was artists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized enough even to hold down a clerk 's job . And I got into a few fist-fights with painters male and female , because I held that the visual and plastic arts were defunct . Well , there was a kind of relief in surgical sex ( with goodbyein the morning ) and none of the clinging nuances or intimacies I 'd known with Isobel . But it showed in my face , which that spring began to lose the last bloom of a boy 's . I began to look like so many city Americans  --  hard , and resembling a television set or a frigidaire . But it was my ambition to be known from Portland to Atlanta as the Good Bed of the Season . That spring I sank to the depths of vulgar gaiety found in the comedies Isobel 's crowd so admired . Late in April , almost at the end of my concert tour , I ran into Harry Korchinski at a party for the Ballet Theater . His money had been financing some extraordinary adventures in The Dance , which even made Pravda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my side , for I really wanted to hear all the dirt about my West End ; to play the fly-on-the-wall , withoutthe consequences of getting squashed. -O , lover , we 've been reading of your successes with such pride ! We 're betting on you against Gieseking.  --  You knew I left the night of that party ? I said , gnawing an olive.  --  Who does n't ? Just broke our hearts ! At least he looked at me when he was talking to me : most smart sets carry on a conversation with their eyes roving the room ; to see who else they know.  --  Perhaps now you 'll have time to come for a ride in my red convertible.  --  What do you mean , time ?  --  Well , I mean , you 're not tied down any more .  --  Was I ever ? -O , you and Isobel lasted longer together than any couple I 've ever known . At least one month.  --  Whose business was it ?  --  But we thought , said Harry , nibbling at an artichoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Isobel 's funeral , after she took the sleeping tablets ...  --  WHAT ?  --  There you are . It 's not by any means over yet , as Louisa hoped . No , I was just making a little experiment in applied psychology. ,  --  Then she 's all right ?  --  I 'm sure she is . No one 's seen her since you left . But her kind always lands on their feet . . . . O , why am I so bitter about women ? I expect it 's because I see through them . I sort of envy you , David . You do n't . As I walked down Park Avenue to my hotel , I realized what I was doing , and what I was missing . My sexual fandangoalong the Eastern Coast meant that I was behaving like a drop of mercury in a vacuum . I was tired ; I was weary of sleeping in hotels and eating in restaurants ; I never wanted to see a bar again . And I knew how much of me I 'd left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd deposited it there , as in a safe in a bank . It was on the keyboard of my locked piano , on the walls . It was in the bed we 'd bought . But to prove something to myself I had jumped from Isobel 's treadmill onto the more pointless moiling one of a well-to-do young gentleman in the life of large cities . Thus I learned that everyone wishes to be bound , in spite of himself . There were three choices of prison  --  love , religion , or the madhouse . The free man could n't , and did n't want to , exist . I had escaped from my jail for a while : the fecklessness of my life on this concert tour had become another ennui  --  that of limitless deserts and unscalable mountains . Near my hotel a horn blew at the curb . It was Harry in his138p139Packard convertible , his hair blowing in the spring evening : - O , you ! Let 's go to the Oak Room and go mad !  --  No , thanks . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll knock you up , as the British say , within theweek . I could n't sleep . Isobel 's face kept whirling before me . All this was because we knew each other ; and yet we 'd made for each other a place to go to , which is about all there is in life . We had six rooms that at least were all ours , and she had made them reflect us . People said I was a noble young pianist , but where did that leave me ? They could complimentme , and then go away to their own loves and their own solitudes . At least with Isobel I 'd been forever adjusting and coping . And life and love are nothing else but trial and error . So I left the hotel before dawn and took a milk train . I was weary ; my season in the sun was over for now . And the sun not only warms ; it burns and glares . I thought of the gray quiet of our bedroom , where Isobel kept the Venetian blinds forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way no cocktail party ever enfolds one . I 'd never seen Fruit Street Alley in the spring . Children were rollerskating . Mrs Bloom passed a sardonic comment on me to her gossips . Wash was bleaching on the television aerials ; a pianino up the block by Aunt Ada 's was strumming a tarantella . I walked up three flights of stairs and knocked on my own door , though I had one of the two keys . No answer . I let myself in . Dust from West End chimneys had begrimed everything ; she had n't shut the windows since last she was here . On our bed the sheets were gray and rumpled . When had she last got up from it ? But there were our two pillows , filthy now , propped up the way she liked them when she drank her morning coffee . In the kitchen every last plate of our dinner service was in the sink , with grease stale on them like swamp muck ; cock/roaches sported indolently like rich people on the lip of a swimming pool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . The lock of my pianoforte had been forced open ; the keyboard was spotted from who knows whose drunken fingers . The icebox had been permitted to defrost ; within was a patch of fungus where some lettuce had rotted away . But in our closets were most of her dresses and hats . Evidentlythis was still her base . I repented having kept up the rent , the gas , and the electricity . I sat down in my favorite chair , sprinkled with dust , and lit a cigarette . And after an hour I heard remembered light steps on the staircase , and a familiar cigarette cough . I was even angrier than when I went away . I stood up , grinding out my third cigarette . At last I knew how men feel before they murder . I did n't really want to go up to Meg and Louisa 's when our own party broke , but I had to have some vengeance on David . Love is a see-saw : when you 're up you want to give pleasure ; when you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much I 'd schemed for that party ! But that 's how all men are , from the finest to the crumbiest : they want results , and they never think of the foresight that goes to make those results . I wanted it to be a good party , and it was , almost till the last moment . Things just got out of hand . For all I know , a party may be like a Noel Coward play : you set the stage as prettily as you know how , but the actors forget their lines . At that party for the first time I saw cruelly the difference between David Murray and Isobel Joy . We 'd never been with other people in the month we 'd lived together . Things start happening when two lovers come down from their cloud and walk the common earth . Yet in that month of living together before we gave our housewarming , David andp141I had already created our own heaven and our own hell . Most of the time I was happy  --  so happy that I regretted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . O , I know he resented the position I 'd put him in . Woman 's heart is won with woman 's hand , and I 'd decided the night I met him that I 'd make a home for him  --  providedof course that he 'd support me in a style he was used to and I was n't . One thing I learned , watching my Mom scrub floors during the depression , was that bed and dollars certainly have a lot to do with one another . But at the party the strangeness  --  indeed the almost impossibility  --  ofour life together was unmasked . I suppose that 's why we blew up at each other . The tension was there , like rumors behind a door ajar . For a month I 'd almost conditionedDavid , as scientists say of white mice . But that evening our love was unable to bear the scrutiny of the real world . No one at our party was fooled as to the true state of things . So I sat up at Meg and Louisa 's drinking , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to with the crowd . They knew I 'd changed . Yet I needed their way of life ; I was never fully relaxed with David , even when we were making love . He had too much dignity ; there was something of himself he could n't ever fully give me , and it was this aloneness in him that I desired to smash . That was why I broke a plate after he did , for a different reason . After a little while Mr Kubelik came into Meg and Louisa 's for a drink . He was hot for me that February night , but I did n't give him the time of day . So Meg and Louisa lured him into their bedroom for a gleesome threesome , and the second party began to go to pieces . Tom Bernstein began to paw me and talk about two-on-the-aisle ; I slapped him . Poor sweet goony Harry Korchinski wanted me to go sleighriding with him . Carmen S O'Brien and Dick Dobbs went off to her apartment , a perfect mating of slobs , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own little house , locking the door lest the landlord come drooling after me , when he 'd got through sporting with Meg and Louisa . It did n't surprise me to find David had gone  --  either for a walk in the snow , or to his mother 's for the night . I sat in our disordered living room with a nightcap in my hand , wanting my David there so I could scold him and then apologize . I even played softly a whole album of Don Giovanniin order to see what he found in that stuff . I cried more than a little . There was a scratching at the door , but I did n't open , for all sorts of drunks and dengerates prowl the ' West End after midnight . Finally I went to bed and lay with my ear close to the airshaft . One flight up I could hear that old goat from Prague chasing my two friends about their bedroom , and little plops as they threw a bra here and a panty there.  --  Ducky , you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . It was the first time I 'd slept alone since David and I set up housekeeping . That bed seemed all too spacious , and I lay across it diagonally . I was surprised that I did n't fall asleep ; I missed his warmth , and even his snoring . I threw his pillow on the floor , but that did n't help at all . I missed too the dark smell of his skin , for something flowed between us as we slept : I 'd never enjoyed a slumber deeper and more consoling than in this past month . Finally I put his pillow between my legs , and sleep took me . Next morning I had to get my own coffee . My darling still was n't there , and I felt the whispers of panic . He was n't lying in the living room either , as he used to do after our quarrels . After dressing I discovered he 'd taken two bags of clothing . The telephone was dead . In all our little house I could n't find more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bathroom . Well , there were canned goods in his study and fresh stuff in the refrigerator.  |p143One  week to the day after David left , that cute telephonemanRoy came to fix the telephone ; he showed me how the wire had been cut in a place I 'd never have suspected to look . I began to pity David . Roy made me play him all three albums of Don Giovanni . Not till his third visit , after discovering that Moddom 's husband was away from home , did Roy begin to play the tomcat , but not like a normal man . He was n't interested in consummation . He liked to have me pose before him . Or he liked to smear me with olive oil or anchovy paste , which he brought from his fifth visit on , in discreet paper bags . He gave me a lot of money to stage for him , all by myself , or with props , the sort of scenes traveling salesmen like at stag parties . We never made love in any sense of the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and showing our secrets to each other . He brought many dirty pictures to show me . Sometimes he brought his camera and photographed me , but I would never look at the developed results . He said he was a voyeur , that he 'd never had a woman and never wanted to . In the third week that David was away , I 'd retreated into a dream world . I received only Roy . If Meg or Louisa knocked at the door , I pretended not to be home . I read in the papers that David had given a successful concert in Philadelphia . Seeing his picture , so cool and handsome in white tie , I wept for hours . Finally I knew that what I 'd resented in my lover , and had tried to break , was that he did n't belong only to me ; the world had a vested interest in him . In the fourth week of my aloof nightmare a leak sprung in the kitchen sink , which was tiled with dirty dishes , and I had Mr Kubelik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your husband for the rent . Mailed from Baltimore .. . ( I 'd been betting with myself that David would try to starve me out . ) But I said icily to the landlord :  |  --  What 's so funny ? Did you expect he 'd let the rent lapse while he 's away on a concert tour ?  --  I haff known it to happen , in the case of luff-nests , the landlord said , winking . He planned to stay for a drink and a chat , but I got him out the door . Anyhow Roy and I had drunk up everything in the house , except a bottle of domestic Chablis . An hour after Mr Kubelik left , I thought I heard Roy 's sheepish knock . I opened , and there stood David 's mother . It was turning spring , and there she was , handsome in a tailleur , toque , and veil . I clutched the knob ; my hands were trembling so.  --  You forgot to come to tea at my house , my dear . So it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Wo n't you come in ?  --  I do n't know , Isobel , whatever gave me the idea I 'd find you here . I suppose all mothers act on hunches.  --  David gave me the key when he left . Told me to make myself at home . In fact , he wanted his place kept up , you see .... While I was stammering , Mrs Murray took off her gloves and her spring coat ; I hoped I 'd look as smart and wellpreservedif ever I reached sixty . Then she caught sight of the brimming squalid sink in the kitchen.  --  My dear , at that dreadful party I had somehow formed the notion that you were an excellent housekeeper.  --  I 've been rather ill , I said , wishing I 'd thought to break those plates as I 'd used them . I thought I 'd die when Mrs Murray insisted on helping me with the dishes . And I must say she was an efficient worker , for all her money and her real estate . As she was putting away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She made clucking sounds of concern :  --  I 'll send out for some DDT powder at once . . . .  --  I 'll go out for some later , Mrs Murray . . . .  |p145(Roy  's money was down to twelve cents . ) Then she tied up her pretty gray hair in a piece of linen , and we did the house together . I saw for the first time that the older generation , which my crowd despised , had trained their daughterswell , for she was an ace with broom , duster , and vacuum cleaner . But she could n't resist the little digs that all women love :  --  I imagine you thought , Isobel dear , that you 'd do all these chores the day before he gets home , just to surprise him ? I knew better than to snap back at her , but I did my best to keep her out of our bedroom . But she arrived there in the natural course of her labors . She threw open the door without any ceremony . When her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my million cigarette ashes ( I did n't dare tell her I 'd economized on laundry with Roy 's money ) , she said softly :  --  Pardon me , my dear , but this is really rather disgusting .  --  Do n't think I 've been sleeping here , I blurted . This bed is the way he left it six weeks ago ... .  --  It is still disgusting , Isobel . So we stripped the double bed and turned the mattress . She noted the puffballs of dust under the springs , but this time she said nothing , only going after them with all the cleaning appliances at her disposal . When we got through , the little house looked sprucer than it ever had , even on the day when poor David cleaned it for our housewarming.  --  I shall never breathe a word to my son of this , said Mrs Murray.  --  I hope you wo n't . I 've learned my lesson.  --  That 's an easy thing to say , my dear . As witness New Year 's resolutions . I remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can of smoked turkey ; so I made sandwiches and a grateful cup for Mrs Murray , which she swallowed with the samep146thoughtful efficiency in which she 'd swept and garnished our house . She wiped her mouth on our last presentable napkin :  --  I hold to my theory that you 're a good cook . Whatever became of all those odd young people who were at the party ? -O , still around . Meg and Louisa , for instance , live just upstairs . Shall I call them down ? I know they 're dying to sec you again.  --  Please do n't bother , my dear , said Mrs Murray , rising and putting on her hat , coat , and gloves . At the door she said with her fiendish gentility :  --  Well , I suppose by now you know how sensitive David is ?  --  Why should I know ? Then I saw what this woman 's anger could be like , icy and righteous ; I should have preferred her to slap me in the face :  --  Isobel , do n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ code than you young people . But there are limits to your lying and my tolerance . When a young man gives a young woman the key to his apartment .. . There was n't much I could say . By some force of witchery that I now knew she possessed , Mrs Murray took me across the street with her to the Stations of the Cross in Father Russo 's church . As we walked up the alley , where little buds were beginning to sprout from the hydrangea shrubs , and the sun of an early spring afternoon was a little chill , and Mrs Bloom was rubbering at us out of her apartment , Mrs Murraytook my arm and said hopelessly :  --  Isobel , Isobel , how often on Sunday mornings have I stood on this very corner ! Call it spying , if you will . I wanted to see if my son went to Mass . He never did , of course . A shiver went through me , but I tried a light tone :  --  He might have overslept . Why did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are a few things a mother may do , and many that she may not . . . .  |p147More  and more I was awaking to what an extraordinary person this woman was . We got inside the chapel just as the Stations of the Cross were beginning ; the celebrant was pretty little Father Russo . There followed Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament , and I must say the singing and the incense made me feel good . Out of the corner of my eye I watched Mrs Murray ; she was really devout . She followed closely from a costly prayerbook , and her every genuflection was a treat . She seemed to find in church something missing from her life , but she did it more gracefully than my own Mom , who said the rosary as though it was an orgy . Our voices blended in the hymns ; I tried to outsing Mrs Murray 's own sure alto in those Latin words which I 've never understood , but sound so reassuring : Tan tum ergo sacramentum Veneremur cernui , Et anticum documentum .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confession ; so I did too . It was so long since I 'd been I 'd even forgotten the opening formula of **26;6400;TOOLONG - sinned , and a priest , smelling of tobacco behind his grille , helped me out rather peevishly . I made up a long list of venial sins and rattled them off , inventing lavishly small crimes I 'd never even think of committing . I wondered whether he 'd give me absolution , whether he could sense that I was hiding the important things . He did absolve me , and I stumbled through the Act of Contrition , and made a great show of reciting my penance in front of the main altar , to impress David 's mother . She took my arm quite cozily now :  --  My dear , you 're almost as devout as those rapt nuns at Perpetual Adoration.  --  Church does one good , I said , quite aware that I 'd madep148that most horrid of things , a bad confession , and was deeper dyed than ever.  --  Do n't ever forget that , Isobel . Outside in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shaking hands with his few parishioners . All of them were women , with a light on their tired faces . So my Mom used to look on Sunday mornings , even if my Pop had beaten her the night before.  --  Ah , there , Miss Joy , the priest called to me pleasantly . I introduced him to Mrs Murray , though I was surprised he remembered me from that night I 'd brought him the lobster sandwich and the highball . But in the eyes of Mrs Murray it did my stock no harm to be buddy-buddy with a priest . For she took my arm anew , and said , I thought , with real affection :  --  Ah , you do go to church here ?  --  No , at Saint Mary of the Angels , but the good father knows . Once he wanted David to become a scoutmaster ... . After she 'd gone home  --  having invited me to tea once again  --  1 went up to the spit apartment to watch the spring twilight fall on our alley . I watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work to supper and to women to whom they were truly married . I felt lower than I ever had , yet better too ; I drank the last bottle of David 's wine ; and since there was nothing to eat in the house , I thought of going out into the spring night and picking me up a man , who would invite me to China House for supper . Or I brooded on sponging some din-din off Meg and Louisa , but I could n't have stood their chatter and their reproaches , which would be the payment for a drink and supper . Finally I played another album of Don Giovanni ( which was beginning to make sense to me ) and put myself to bed hungry , though I went so far as to nibble at the leavings of Mrs Murray 's smoked turkey sandwich . Tomorrow , I thought ,  |p149I  'll have to do something , and I just do n't know what it will be . David 's face came before me ; I passed in review all his nicenesses and his awfulnesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other man had . I cried into the mattress , for there were no clean sheets . Down the airshaft came the sound of Meg and Louisa arguing , of the overalled men reknowing their wives on this first night of spring . And it occurred to me that I was a good girl and a bad one at the same time  --  the two so mixed up in me that my right hand never knew what my left was doing . For I had betrayed my sex ( and Mrs Murray 's ) and exalted it at the same time . And finally I 'd both saved and betrayed my David . Nothing was black or white ; all was fishy gray . I got up from the bed , wrenched open the piano lock with a hammer and screwdriver , and played the one showtune that I know : My Funny Valentine , ' singing like Mary Martin . For in my head was an air from Don Giovanni , Or sai chi 1'onore , ' which would n't let me sleep , for it spoke of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next morning I had every intention of taking the soiled laundry down to Aunt Ada 's , with the intention of commiseratingwith her on her phlebitis , drinking her sauterne , and maybe borrowing some money . The doorbell rang . It was Roy . He had ten days ' vacation from the Bell Telephone Company . He wanted me to go to his hunting shack in Maine . We went in a bus . At the end of his vacation ( he did n't even ask for poses from me any more ; we were like brother and sister ) he said :  --  I inform Moddom that I 'm thinking of getting married . Yes , seriously . I took her along on this hunting trip to remindme of my past loathsomeness . For we were loathsome together , were n't we ? A nasty little boy and a nasty little girl ...  |  --  ' Vas I loathsome ? I said , getting mad.  --  Moddom is my number one prize horror . And whateverhappened to Moddom 's husband ?  --  Dead . I suppose I killed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apartment slide , half hoping that Mrs Murray would call again to help me . She did n't . There were more dishes than ever in the sink ; the cockroaches and the mice owned the place . Then Harry Korchinski came one day and banged on the door , and I went for a ride in his Packard convertible.  --  I saw David , the old sweetie , at a party in New York last night.  --  Does n't interest me in the slightest , I said , my heart burning. - O , but it does ! He did n't come back to the apartment with me  --  he was always delicate and decent  --  but he put $100 in my hand , in small bills.  --  I 'll pay you back , Harry. -O , I know you never will , but you need it . You look awful . And the place looks worse . Get your hair done . I 've lost faith in you , sweetie ( I never had much ) , but I do sort of care for your guy . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills , I climbed upstairs quite merrily , thinking that now I could queen it for several weeks . Then , as I was putting the key in the lock , the door opened of itself , and there stood David , older , thinner , and as hard as a New York chorus boy . He struck me three times across the face with his open hand , and I went down like a charwoman , and Harry 's greenbacks flew all over the landing . To be sure , they 'd had their differences before , but they'dmade them up , and the pulling together of their sunderedpersonalities had made their love all the sweeter , as a house/wife handles with extra care a fine piece of china , sedulously cemented after the dropping . They had become aware of raw spots that were n't to be touched , a mutual expedition of Duman geography . When David struck her in the face , their love passed into its second phase : the honeymoon was over . At least they could look back upon the first , almost perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They knew the pitfalls now , as one who has been struck by lightning hastens to erect a lightning rod and take out insurance . It took a week for them to enter upon something like the old footing . That first night in bed , each turned from the other , and each heard the other 's brain working with rancor :  --  Still mad , Isobel ?  --  I really do n't know , hon. Something pricks me somewhere , and I ca n't locate the splinter . They had been both to blame for the first rupture , but neither could change the design , though each might make resolutions in the future to be a little kinder . But they got back to what , to an outsider , might seem their pristine intimacy . But to Isobel and David  --  not quite . He knew she was watching him constantly , half tenderly , half apprehensively ; he could not now leave the little house without her wondering whether he 'd packed his bags for the second time . In point of fact , she set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more aware of his bondage . He could n't go out for a walk but that she set the time for his return . And more eager than ever was she to read his mail , though she still waited for him to open it . And she began to impinge a trifle on his privacy ; she made fun of the prissy way he brushed his teeth ; he told her that her legs were by no means the choicest part of her ; she hinted that he was losing his hair . These small sieges of snipingdid n't occur every day that spring , but there were petty alarums and excursions when each had had a drink or two ,  |p152and  began to ponder on how much they 'd surrendered of their mutual security . She now reminisced in factual detail of others who had loved her , making implied comparisons between their technique and his . And she would poke fun at all that modern music he was practicing , and would return from a shopping spree with disks of brash showtunes , which she would put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigarette . So he would wrestle with her  --  not always with the laughing camaraderie of the first days . He broke several of her Cole Porter records , and she smashed some of Don Giovanni , which she was beginning to love and understand . Such incidents are laughable on a honeymoon , when our tolerances are stretched ; between two people who know each other too well , they become ugly and strained . Finally cognizant of the isolation that she and David had erected against the world , aware of its implications after he 'd left her , Isobel began aggressively to make friends with the other tenants in the apartment house . Housewives whom David did n't know were coming up to borrow sugar or deliver a freshly baked pie , often when he was practicing . People in the courtyard took to calling him by his first name . Meg and Louisa were forever dropping in of an evening for a drink , and pointedly remaining till a plate of spaghetti and chops was put in their laps.  --  If those bitches come here once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to walk out on them.  --  And you 're the one , said Isobel , who 's always talking about good manners . . . . Mr Kubelik was forever in the little house , fixing a pipe here , doing a scratch of painting there . Isobel engaged the landlord in elaborate conversations about Ana Pauker ( whom he knew well ) and Communism in Czechoslovakia . Sometimes , hearing their voices in the living room , David wouldp153leave the keyboard and put his ear to the keyhole , to sample the badinage between his lady and the landlord . Now David had always been moderately virile , his desire and capacity varying from week to week . In the first stage of their love he had no doubt but that he satisfied his mistress . The first month , before he went away , had been a period of deep physical peace for them both . Their rhythms had coincided ; each , it appeared , was in the mood to make love in the same way , at the same time . But when he returned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the kind that would sicken any man . Now that he was composing a sinfonia concertante for orchestra , much of his capacity went into the music . And she sensed it and resentedit . She would even jeer at him when he did n't feel like making love :  --  Are n't we getting old ? she murmured in her languor. -O , for God 's sake , he 'd say , getting up and lighting a cigarette . And as he paced , petulant , he 'd hear her low laughter until she fell asleep without his aid . It was useless to tell her that his vitality was engaged upon another plane ; she came from people who hated their work and used their bodies to forget it . She would have shrieked with laughter to hear that an artist responds to life with his whole personality , and cannotenter into anything which distracts him from his mirage . She had been bred to a reasoning which subtracted body from soul ; everything was neatly compartmentalized in her brain.  --  Artists , she once said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoodwink the public into thinking they 're a speciesfrom another planet . David had winced , but he never forgot or forgave it . How much happier she 'd have been , kept by a tycoon ! ( And they never had had these reservations in the first days . Was itp154that the first trust was forever shattered ? She had no place else to go , and he at least with her had a roof of his own . ) He knew almost the first question she 'd ask him :  --  Were you a good boy while you were away on tour ? Of course ! How could I be anything else ? Were you a good girl ?  --  You know I was ... . But there was a foggy hinterland of suspicion and bitterness . He did n't know whether she believed him , or he could believe her . Unfaithfulness , when neither partner catches the other in flagrante , is a shadowy vice , and feeds like a ghoul on vacuum and prevarication . David had grown up among artists and intellectuals who abrogated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came of stock maudlinly religious and morally fuzzy . He thought that a full confession of his adventures could only hurt her feelings and prod her to revenge ; and he was afraid of what she might have to confess to him.  --  Mr Kubelik pays you court , hon , he said one day.  --  Jeal-ous ! You know we get better service than anyone else in this apartment ! As summer was beginning and Fruit Street Alley was odorous with dog dung and shrill with the playing of children , unaccountable bills began to flood their mailbox . Food that Isobel had charged while he was away . Sinister little memos from department stores . Reminders from the sheriff that Isobel had n't paid her poll tax . ( Harry Korchinski 's $100 had long since been returned. )  --  Are you sure this is the last ? he would say , frowning over his checkbook.  --  I swear it , hon ! she would cry , kissing his forehead . ENext week more dribbles and chits would come in , and Isobel would look her prettiest and say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were times when hep155could n't stay in the same room with her , with her talk of fashions , her reading of Vogue and Harper 's Bazaar , her hintingof the smart parties she might now be going to if she had n't surrendered her sovereignty to him.  --  My God , how can you be so irresponsible financially ?  --  Why , that 's what you love me for , she said coolly . I 'm the meadow in which you play . As usual , she was hitting the nail on the head , and he flushed.  --  Hon , let 's face it , after all your moaning and groaning about your checkbook . If it was n't me , it would be someone else.  --  I could always live alone , he flashed.  --  O no , you could n't ! You might have once , with your a-r-t . But not now . You see , you 're passing through a stage . You 're passing from a very young spoiled man into I-don'tknow-what . And at this stage of the game , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to prove something to yourself in this affair ... . These sessions of airing of laundry , of ill-concealed recriminationwere new to him . She was far more perspicacious than he 'd thought . Something had aged in her during their separation ; something of her mother 's bitterness was brewing in her . But he tried to explain all this to himself by saying that she fought with weapons he would not deign to use.  --  Once you promised to take care of me , he said sullenly.  --  And that 's exactly what I 'm doing , hon. Though you seem not to realize it . Yet his nerves were n't necessarily rawer than usual , though the sinfonia concertante was costing him a deal of energy . She was surer of him now , too sure . She crossed barriers that friends or lovers never wisely may . She would call endearingly to him as he crossed the courtyard . Some of his old acquaintancescame to call at the little house . Isobel would spill her beer on the floor if they became too engrossed in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the studio couch one of these friends , who had come a long way to see David , and the hour was late . He shook her harshly in their bedroom , for the friend , chagrined , had said while taking his leave :  --  Well , David ! Never saw you under anyone 's thumb before ! Quite a metamorphosis , old man , ha-ha !  --  Do you wish me to leave you ? Isobel cried after the shaking.  --  Of course not , you fool . ( He knew that now she could n't leave him , and most of the time he did n't want her to . ) But he was disturbed by the tone of voice they now often used to each other . Once they could have called each other fool in a sweet jest ; now it had an edgy ring , as when people toss off jokingly something they deeply and menacingly mean for true . Once , not long ago , they had been lovers with an awareness of the differencebetween them ; now they were all too frequently collidinglike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as an I-beg-your-pardon.  --  Isobel , why do n't you go away somewhere until I finish my piece for orchestra ?  --  It would cost you $700 to send me to Bermuda in style , and you 're always yelling about economy ... . She had him coming and going . He saw now that his mother had kept him swaddled all his life ; Isobel 's sense of reality was wide and elastic . And those gray eyes now often looked past him in a mild disdain ; they saw something on the wall behind him.  --  You 're so busy with your music paper that you never even look at me . Why do n't you write some notes on my shoulder ? Draw a staff and a clef and compose a listenable showtune , instead of a stuffy old symphony in one movement ....  --  You just do n't understand what I 'm trying to do , he said , looking up from his scoring.  |  --  No , I 'm afraid I do n't . You want to please the world , but you have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better off if they drowned all geniuses like newborn kittens .. .  --  Thank you , Isobel . In those days when he was composing and practicing incessantly ( and Mrs Kubelik often rapped on the wall ) , she kept him waiting for his supper , or burned his favorite dishes . Or she would go up for a drink to Meg and Louisa 's and blow in so martini-ridden that she had to take to bed , after weeping and praying him to undress her . Then David would go to the icebox and get his own supper , or go out to a restaurant . Sometimes she kept food so long he had to throw it out . By midsummer the crowd had taken them up in a big way for intimate supper parties and cocktails frequented by ' amusingpeople ' of whom David had never heard . He accompanied her to them if only to get out of a house where Isobel would sit for hours , smoking , drumming her fingers on the coffee table , and glaring out into the lively alley . David never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was high , he envisioned having a brief fling with Louisa , who , he suspected , would be even more possessive than Isobel . Olivia lent him books on the Negro problem , and did her best to offer herself to him , an offer which did not appeal to him . Indeed at these slatternly parties , he and Isobel seemed husband-and-wifely ; they were forever interrupting each other 's best stories and talking about us . The crowd found their relationship more stuffy than even a Victorian marriage . Isobel rose to the bait , and came to think of herself as a stuffy wife . Tom Bernstein put his arm odiously round David 's shoul-der :  --  Izzy was quite a girl before she took the veil , fella .  --  I suppose you want to tell me all about it.  --  Ask me no questions , Tom said . I 'm remembering that  |p158mole  on her pearly flank . She was a great one for nude bathing.  --  By moonlight , of course , David said , turning away . Yes , Isobel was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to placate her , he was squiring her to the summer theater and to any dismal movie she fancied to watch . It 's almost as though she were pregnant , he said to himself . And in a sense he was bribing her  --  to send out the laundry regularly , not to let meat rot in the refrigerator , to prepare his food with her former expertness . One evening she dropped a platter of steak on the floor just as she was setting it on the table.  --  Isobel naughty , she said . But platter slippery . And she waited for him to get the mop.  --  You dropped it . And you dropped it because you 're stinking drunk.  --  You 've got one hell of a nerve talking to me like a slavey.  --  You were at Meg and Louisa 's for three hours while I was orchestrating.  --  Well , what of it ? You sit here with your eyes glued to that music paper , and I 'm not allowed even to play the phonograph.  --  Because I ca n't concentrate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mop for this mess.  --  Get it yourself . You dropped the dinner . I suppose now you expect to be taken out to a restaurant ? ( Her eyes were bloodshot. )  --  Well , you do n't expect me to whip up another steak at this hour , do you ? He put the damper on the chilly rage that was rising in him , stood up , and took her arm :  --  Look , darling . Does n't it sometimes occur to you that we made a bargain last winter ?  |  --  I 'm doing the best I can . But sometimes you 're a very difficult customer.  --  Isobel , I am what I am . No better , no worse than lots of men . Why do you have to insult me to make your points ? God knows you 're eager enough for your evenings at the theater and your dinners in restaurants . . . . I 'm asking you if you recall that we made a bargain . You were to take care of me in one way , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it seems to be coming all from my part . . . . I suppose that 's part of my penance for not marrying you . . . . I have no real , no legal hold over you ... .  --  If you 'd just try to be a little more like other people .. .  --  But I ca n't ! And I do n't want to ! . . . O , I get it ... . There 's a resentment on your side that I choose to be me . Have I ever criticized your being you ? Have n't I been generous ? But it seems that the more I indulge your whims , the more you want . And I get less and less . Do n't you think you might at least try to be just with me ? Isobel began to raise her voice , as she always did when she was in the wrong , or caught lying :  --  You 're so wrapped up in your music and that piece you 're composing that you lose all sense of proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wish I were a ditchdigger , so I could come home to you at the end of each day 's work and devote myself entirely to your caprices , and forget my filthy labor . But I Iove my work ; ca n't you understand that ? . . . And , my lady , you are living off the earnings of that work ... .  --  You 're always throwing that up to me ! You 're always thinking of money . . . .  --  Before I met you , I never did . You certainly do n't think of it , except to spend it . . . .  --  While we 're on the subject , said Isobel , I do n't like the way you 've taken to counting the contents of your wallet before I go out shopping . . . .  |  --  Have n't I the right to know where I stand financially ? ... I do n't trust you with money , Isobel . And I regret that the financial question has always to rear its head between us .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like some whores I know .. .  --  Pardon me , we 're talking about you , not about whores . Why ca n't you be a little logical ? Or am I asking too much ? All I ask is a little privacy and a decent house . Do you expect me to do the housework and the cooking too ?  --  We could afford a maid , she sniffled.  --  When we hire a maid , I 'll sleep with her too.  --  David , you want me to pack up and get out , do n't you ?  --  Why do n't you just face the issue instead of going to extremes ? No , I do n't want you to leave me . I merely ask you that you live up to your obligations . That is , if obligations and morality exist in the kind of life we 're leading . . . For the first time her face assumed a new look , one that he could only pin down as feline cunning :  --  You 're right , David Murray . I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you I 'm not a minor ... . He felt sick and terribly old :  --  What are you hinting at ? Are you by any chance threateningme ? Yet he knew that for all his logic ( which is said to be a masculine thing ) , she was more aware of imponderables than he . There really was n't a place for logic between them . Ah , how prettily she wept ! For she knew her function . She was neither his wife nor his slave . And now he realized that when she moved in with him , she had n't the least intention of being to him what his mother had been to his father . True , they were in love ( or had been ) , but Isobel was n't going to be swayed by any gratuitous ideas of his about what her position in his house was . She did n't share his belief that he was buying her favors and her companionship . ( Probably she did n't even believe that she could be bought . ) She knewp161that she was necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all it was worth . Putting himself in her shoes , David could scarcely blame her . She knew she was expendable for the brief few years of her beauty -- and in this she was facing fact far more than he did . Had she known it when she was five ? She was one of those rootless , short-lived flowers of American poverty , determined to have her day in the sun . A moralist would say that the blame was all David 's , for not making her an honest woman . ' He never would or could . Like most males past their first fling , he wanted a house to come to in the evening , and a woman in it . So in the last analysis Isobel was insisting on his hewing to his bargain . She was taking more risks than he ; she was the greater gambler.  --  Do you still love me or not ? David said , breaking off suddenly  --  Do you think I 'd stay with you and your stuffy ways if I did n't ?  --  Then put on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate myself for weakening . Almost miraculously her tears dried ; she was the old Isobel . They went downstairs arm in arm , she lovely in a summer frock of green , which was her color , the cardinal color of hope . And Louisa greeted them from the landing above , her arms crossed on her bosom like a charwoman 's in repose :  --  Quarreling , duckies ? Do n't . Bad for the blood pressure and longevity , according to insurance companies ... . In late summer when the stars began to pale and a stiflingbreeze of morning pervaded the ' West End , I was in the habitof awakening . I sensed some tie between my anxieties and thefirst stirrings after daybreak . In the depths of the city there was no cock to crow , but I thought I heard them out Charlestownand Melrose way . And a clarion call went off inside me ,  |p162and  there I was , awaiting the dawn , lying almost moribund in the broad bed beside Isobel . I 'd learned the futility of talking to her when I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other purpose but a fire alarm . When we went to bed it was so stifling that we 'd kick off the last sheet , and now our bodies lay , quite close , but not touching , like mutual archipelagoes . The crack of morn was the only time that I was really alone with myself and could think of my life and of my sinfonia concertante . She had so forged my chains by now that I looked forward to these lonesome reveilles . In this hour I relived something of the personality I had been . At this hour my thoughts were iridescent , as though someone had plied me with a truth serum . I pitied myself and her , and all the sleeping city around us , about to awake to another day of slaving , rushing , and discussing the heat of August , because it was the topic of their common torture , pieces of meat on a broiler under the scorching eye of God . Sometimes I 'd touch Isobel , sometimes I 'd edge over to my own berth in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airshaft came the premonitory sounds of morning : alarm clocks drawing their breath before bursting into a clangy geyser of modern music , a slight dripping from the unidentifiable fungus that grew and flourished at the bottom of the brick chasm between Mr Kubelik 's cells , politely called apartments . There was a remote hooting of trains , impatientat their sidings in the North Station , and the castanettingof milk bottles being delivered . And I wondered what the milkman saw of life , relaxed and shadowy , as he drove about our city in his odd little truck , in easy communion with late drunks and early risers . Then there was the sound too of our garbage being emptied by the little Negro outside our door ( a tip for him at Christmas ! ) , that little man who always cursed if the swill bucket was full of empty beer cans . Beside me Isobel stirred , put her hand over her brow , andp163in her sleep murmured Shut-up . And I was thinking how those who worked in the early morning were both parisitic and predatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives ; they were the town rodents and scavengers . What did the milkman and the garbage collector know of me and Isobel , whom they never saw stirring ? In our city life went on in eight-hour shifts , like three people taking their turn at sleeping in the same bed . A light went on below ; its reflection jumped up the airshaft and fell upon my chest , making its hairiness wave like seaweedin a hot breeze . Of course it was Carmela , the Sicilian lady of seventy , who lived by herself in a warren on the first floor , surrounded by ironing boards , clothes hangers , and a phonograph with a goose-necked horn . Carmela awoke with the hens of Girgenti and went to bed at sunset . Often she accosted me in the courtyard , handing me out of her window cavolfiori sott'olio or sott'aceti :  --  You nicea kid . But you pounda too mucha da piano ... . Or sometimes she sent us up a plate of spaghetti , sensing when Isobel was off to a party , or too drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmela had said , she pretty girl , but she no taken care of you ... . By sheer sound from the airshaft I could visualize every detail of Carmela 's matins . First there was a clicking from her bathroom that meant she was scouring her false teeth . Then there was a swishing from the bowl ( Carmela never took a bath ) when she washed her face ; I imagined her paying special attention to the hairs round a mole on her chin . Then she would sit a long time on her porcelain throne : she would groan for half an hour , literally in travail with her bowels . Sometimes I counted the pops of wind , that sounded like trombones . Finally victory was hers ; there 'd be a joyous flushing , and Carmela 's cackling old voice would begin her daily repertory of Sicilian songs , which she kept up all dayp164long until she went to bed . Some of the tunes sounded so Arabic that I had to get up from bed and set them down on music paper . I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native habitat . O , up our airshaft came all the things that were n't meant to be heard , and indeed never were , until modern man chose to live in stories and in tiers . In a certain sense Meg and Louisa walked on our heads . Those dawnings I wondered if some of the callousness of today 's human beings comes from living in layers and strata , like corpses entombed one upon another because it was too costly to stake out fresh fields for graveyards . Thus that airshaft was an epiglottis of apartment living . Like everyone else I did my own eavesdropping , where the only ethic is that you must n't get caught at it . And the unknown voices of those rudely awakened by that town crier of industrial civilization , the alarm clock :  --  Bobbie , get your leg off mine or I 'll smashya !  --  Ha-ha . Baby , it 's cold outside.  --  Get up , I toldya , ya 'll be late at the plant.  --  I 'm up already . Wan na do something about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flats was a factory worker , an office doll , or a truck driver , they rose early , making me feel isolated from the flux of life . They worked for a time clock ; I by the beat of my own pulse . Yet when I came to dwell upon it , I was freer than most men of the twentieth century . And I heard Meg moo to Louisa above :  --  Rise and shine . And I heard Louisa 's yawn :  --  Ducky , I had the neatest dream . I dreamed you were dead . And I also dreamed that Harry Korchinski had proposed to me , and I was about to become a great lady of the manor in the Ukraine when that damned alarm clock awoke me. . . .  |  --  I happen to know , said Meg , that Harry will never propose to anyone . . . .  --  And I happen to know that we 're being overheard downstairs , ducky . Shut up and come to breakfast ... . Like a small boy I squinched my eyes and pretended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periscope in the airshaft . I knew every detail of Meg and Louisa 's weekday breakfasts , their scrimping on food to keep their figures , their gorging in the evening , particularly if they were invited out . I heard moanings suggesting that each laced the other into a corset . They made me aware of the equivocal sordidness in the life of the American business girl '  --  her dewy morning-freshness , her starving of herself to keep up appearances , her washing and ironing of undies each evening in order to achieve what was known as daintiness . ' The career girl was the apotheosis of the laundry . At last they went off to their department store ; I heard their high heels clicking on Mr Kubelik 's risers , on which all of his tenants hoped to slip and break their necks , in order to sue him . I guessed the blinkings with which they faced the August sun . So pitiable , and so brave  --  and for what ? To sell ladies ' garments to other bitches in order that they might come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their undies against tomorrow . I was almost glad that Isobel and I were lice in the fabric of the system ; a theme came to me for the sinfonia concertante , and I reached over and stroked my girl 's shoulder : -O , go back to sleep , hon.Sometimes her crossness came and sat on her sleeping self like an ape . The light was trickling through the Venetian blinds now ; I knew I would n't go back to sleep . I had been always aware of sleep as a mistress to be wooed ; the thought of not being able to sleep sometimes panicked me . And since I moved outside of life , sleep often betrayed me in that Ip166was never really and truly awake , moving in the field of my own shadowy impulses . I could say : I Shall Not Sleep Tonight , and realize that sleep had heard me and would reply Okay You Wo n't . Thus often I was condemned to lie and brood on all that I had never done and could not do . I remembered my twin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball game from unsuspected polio . And I was delighted that evening when he lay dying . For Teddy was a man 's man ( my father 's phrase ) from the age of three ; the aunts and uncles gave him dimes and quarters for being a little bantam . They had no use for me . They did n't know Teddy as I knew him , for twins have no secrets from each other . He was a cry-baby . Did he bang his finger in the door of our new car ? He 'd scream till he got candy and money . And I almost died of appendicitis because I did n't dare tell my father of the pains in my abdomen . Ah , my twin was handsomer than I. He loved to talk to people ; I preferred to be by myself , with a book or at the piano . In high school he was captain of three sports ; he wanted to play through the game when the polio felled him . His last word was to the grandstand as they carried him off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitching , gang ! O , I did n't understand my twin brother . Teddy was one of those born to bloom early , then spend the rest of his life in a brokerage office . He had died at eighteen , leaving only a glory of youth behind . Teddy was to be envied by the sentimentalist , for he never suffered or grew old . Only I knew that my twin had left a girl with child , which she caused to be destroyed . But then I hated the handsome ostentation in which he had lived , and the unhandsome flourish with which he had died . My mother said that the Blessed Virgin had deserted her only once . And I at eighteen knew how much the world sees , and how little it knows . In the courtyard below I heard children playing . I listenedp167especially for Massimo , tiny and white in his jodhpurs . Massimo often begged from me :  --  Gim me moneys . Gim me nickels.  --  What do you want moneys for ?  --  To buy tonic . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistress to a shyster , who complained of Massimo 's solitaryplaying in the courtyard . She 'd scream at the widow :  --  Ya brat makes too much noise . Lock him inside and tie him to a chair . The mother , an Italian war bride , would screech back :  --  Ah , it was for this his father got killed at Cassino ! Only yesterday Massimo told me :  --  I got this vaccination because I was a baaaad boy . Gim me moneys . Fruit Street Alley was full of children ; I liked sometimes to watch them when I was n't practicing . Their parents were too harassed to play with them ; instead they limped home and glued themselves to their television sets , and blamed and beat the children for faults that were strictly their own . Beside me Isobel opened one eye ; there were beads of sweat on her eyebrows :  --  What were you thinking about ?  --  About children . I ca n't exactly explain ... .  --  There you go . You do n't really believe I 'm very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  David , I 'm jealous of you sometimes . You walk in places I ca n't go . I wanted you all for myself , and you keep evading me . Light me a ciggy.  --  That 's true of any two people . If we ever merged completely , there 'd be nothing more to say to each other . . . .  --  Well , as I once told you in a cafeteria , she said , sleepilyexhaling smoke , it 's nothing like what you read in books , is it ?  --  No . It 's a country without a map . Sometimes you climbp168a lovely mountain . But just as often you get lost in a swamp .  --  You 're funny ... .  --  Yes , I suppose I am . Sub specie aeternitatis .. .  --  I think I 'm a riot too , Isobel said , closing her eyes .  --  Then you have much more perspective than I , mydarling . She raised herself on one arm :  --  Look . Why do n't people stop pretending and trying ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . And I sleep much better than you do . Does n't that prove some-thing ?  --  My dear , I have to worry so your kind can sleep . There have to be watchmen to wake up the snorers.  --  I prefer to be a sleeper . Most people are . You could be too , if you wanted to ... .  --  I prefer to be one of the wakers of this world , I said , somewhat pompously.  --  But why ? Who 's going to care a hundred years from now if you were a great pianist or a great trapeze artist ?  --  No one probably . You once told me I was proving something to myself . You do n't feel that need ... .  --  I never guessed you wanted children . But anyhow you 're boring me . And with a single snore she was asleep again . I got out of bed without disturbing my side of it . Isobel dozed on an open white mesa . I was brooding on what had brought us together in the first place ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fully understand ; they are useful only in a design of turning steam into energy . And when their engines are worn out , they are replaced by fresh ones . I wondered whether I would ever marry , having already had the best and the worst of it . Or had I ? Perhaps the Church understood that marriage is of no benefit to the partners ; it is really the will of posterity , working retro/actively . I wondered whether I should care to have a child by Isobel ; since she was stronger than I , our issue would resemble her . So I dressed slowly and noiselessly , and in the accusing light of another day , I recurred to the Biblical tenets of the family : I had done nothing , really nothing . I had not begotten children ; all I was good for was to pound a piano.  --  Where are you going ? she asked , waking slightly .  --  For a walk.  --  Do n't leave me.  --  You left me for hours when you were asleep , and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 'll make a baby together . I went out and locked the bedroom door noiselessly upon her , to keep her caged as she had caged me . I walked up the sunlit alley where children were romping , with the propellers atop their atomic beanies spinning in the air . I went into the little church across Fruit Street Alley . A Requiem Mass was in progress ; I got in in time for the Dies Irae , sung in the Gregorian mode by boy soprani . I had n't been to Mass for years , except to hoodwink my mother . On the altar was Father Russo ; a black-draped coffin reposed on the catafalque . The church was cool ; professional Irish-American widows were keening to themselves through the chant and the incense . I wondered who had died ; and though I was n't in a state of grace , I found myself offering up this Mass for my dead twin Teddy . Until that hot morning I 'd never appreciated the majesty of the Requiem Mass . In my childhood  --  for the funeral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the rites of my father  --  the formalism of it seemed cold , having nothing to do with the searing cleavage of death and the hypocrisy of mourners . The Gregorian chant in particular evaded me , for I was then in the sickness of romantic music ( havingp170just discovered Chopin ) : the chant then struck me as pure line , and smooth as cathedral stone ; there was nothing pretty about it that my mind could grasp . But that day , kneeling in a solitary pew and assisting at the obsequies of someone I 'd never known ( and might not have liked ) , I comprehendedthe Catholic Requiem . Its ritual and rubric permitted no tearing of the hair ( as the professional keeners were doing )  --  there was simply a hail and farewell on a level surpassinghuman grief . How composed must have been that monk who composed the chant seven hundred years ago ! How impenetrable his own personality ! It was as though sanctified Death himself had put down these cadences , with their insistently reiterated :  --  Et lux perpetua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an elegiac tenderness and hope not of this world ; it was grief transfigured , facing death and the hope of an after-life with an intellectual candor not to be found in the twentieth century . To be sure , there was also terror , human fear . For in one part of that long poem , the Dies Irae , there 's a passage which speaks of the Wrath to be visited on sinners , of the horror of hell blown ' open at the last trumpet . So this Requiem did n't melt me ; rather , it purged me like great tragic poetry , which offers no easy answers , no panacea 'd consolation . I fell to wondering why I did n't come to Mass every Sunday . I knew very well . The capital sin of Pride : I knew that the life I was leading was steeped in mortal sin , and I had no intention of giving it up . Esthetic persons are moved by the liturgy of the Catholic Church even when their minds reject its premises , and the doctrines based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in my boyhood I 'd been conditioned ( O , wise Holy Mother ! ) by the catechism and the natural seasonal rhythm of the Church year , from Advent to Easter . That morning I was astonished how strong the atavistic appealp171still was , as though , from my early training , I 'd been put on a jess from the wrist of God the Falconer , Who often still tested the potency of this leash , jerking me back to Him . And I knew at last that , no matter how often I strayed away , my reflexes would lead me back to the Church , which was my mother 's sole prop . I saw that Father Russo , like all priests dewy from the seminary , was still saturated by the glories of the liturgy ; he had n't yet learned to scurry and mumble his way through Mass so that his parishioners could catch trains . He took his time , like a secular lover , slim under his black Gothic chasuble . He and his altar boy were joined in some ceremonialcommunion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he exacted a similar careful response from the acolyte . I had never seen a Mass more handsomely said . Father Rushton had forgotten long ago , what with the weights of his parish and the economic sanctions of the archbishop . O , you good little nuns , what training you gave me in my boyhood ! You taught me to the letter what was really going on in that Sacrifice ! Millions of Catholics tell their beads during the Mass or glance at holy pictures in their missals , unmindful of the drama of crucifixion and unearthly love going on under their very noses . I used to follow the Mass from a sumptuous missal , which I 'd mislaid in the navy . So I was happy to find that there were prayerbooks in the pew racks . I followed every word of this Requiem . Across town , even in the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart , there would be all manner of abuses  --  from Masses every hour on the hour to nineteenth century operatic music . ( Only recently our archbishop had banned full orchestras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got a shock . The music changed from the appointed plain chant to a florid Pie Jesu , sung by a lovely fresh soprano , a girl soprano . I could n't resist turningaround to the choir loft to see who was responsible forp172this outrage . Under the organ pipes , her score on a lighted music stand , stood a tall girl , wearing a mannish suit , with closecropped hair , and a tiny felt hat on her head . She sang beautifully , but I guessed the music was n't to her taste either . I guessed that it was Gounod . I looked at her several times , even though fifteen years ago Father Rushton had rebuked me publicly from the altar for gawking in church . Then the girl soprano sat down , and the boys took over the plain chant again , and I felt better . At the close of the Requiem , which simply stops , as though there must be an end to classic grief , the coffin was incensed and sprinkled by Father Russo ; the fat men of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to the hearse . Father Russo distributed Communionto those who wished it ( mostly people who had happened in to the Requiem Mass ) . The tall girl came down and received too ; I watched the punctilio of her motions , for I remembered how many other women had embarrassed me , going to and coming from the Communion rail , looking not as though they had participated at a Supreme Banquet , but as though they wondered whether they were looking smart in their Sunday outfits . There was something most elegant and most reserved in the young singer . When the church was emptying , except for those tired sorrowful women , who spend half their mornings on their knees before the Blessed Sacrament , lighting one taper after another , usually to the cult of the Little Flower , I had an uncontrollable impulse . I ascended to the choir loft by the narrow stairway spirally and arrived on the balcony , which smelled acridly of the boy choir , already rushed out of doors , denatured of their sanctity . The loft smelled of old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dough-faced Irish woman , with a toque and a veil , was just closing the roll-top of her console and locking it.  --  May I try the organ ? I said . It has a wonderfully reedy  |p173sound  like the ones in Germany . Not at all gooey like most American instruments . The organist snapped at me :  --  Well , now , young man , it 's not really in my province . I 'm not sure our pastor would approve . I am the only one with permission to touch it . Organs are expensive , you know , and we ca n't afford to let know-nothings bang on it . Besides , do you belong to this parish ?  --  I assure you , I said , speaking in my church whisper , I know how to handle it ... . And a low voice spoke up from the shadows : -O , Malvina , be a sport and let him play it . It was the young soprano , still kneeling in her choir pew for her devotions after Communion.  --  Well , all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no boogie-woogie . And remember to turn the blower off . The official organist got down off her high bench ; her veil jiggled ; she took up an enormous handbag of alligator skin and brandished it at me to let her pass in the narrow aisle . I said seriously :  --  I think you over-accompany the plain chant . And you put in juicy unorthodox harmonizations that would make Pius X turn in his sarcophagus ... .  --  Really , such impudence ! I 've been organist here for twenty years . Since Father Nencini was pastor ! .. . She pecked her way out of the choir loft like a ruffled hen , and I opened the console and sat down on the bench ; I swung my legs over the radial arch of the pedals . It was years since I 'd touched an organ ; as a pianist it was better that I did n't . I pressed the power switch , and the wind came up with a hiss . I struck several chords with the full organ ; then I realized that the loafers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toe , causing me to strike two pedal notes at once . So I kicked them off and tried a rapid chromatic scale in my stockinged feet.  |  --  Not very reverent of you , said the girl 's voice . In my attention to the mechanics of the instrument , I had n't noticed that she was standing at my shoulder , and her prayerbook drooped from her hand over one rank of stops . I did n't answer , but played straight through the Bach Preludeand Fugue in A-Minor . I was n't as rusty as I 'd feared , even though the keys of an organ are like dough to a pianist , and the instrument rang brassily through the church . Malvinaalways kept it down to the nice-nelly murmur of Irish lady organists , who specialize in swooning tremolo 'd postludesand too slow hymn tempi . When I 'd finished , the young singer was regarding me with flashing green eyes , for the bonds between musicians are possibly the last in the twentieth century :  --  Good heavens ! You could have poor old Malvina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I thought you must be too , I said , feeling rather fuzzily pleased . You sing beautifully . But why on earth did you sing that horrid treacly Pie Jesu ? She smiled shyly in such a way that she seemed to be smiling far under green water , like an undine :  --  It is horrible music , is n't it ? But our pastor loves it , the same way he insists on Good Night , Sweet Jesus ' after Friday evening devotions . And then the Espositos ( they 're the relations of today 's corpse ) gave me twenty-five dollars to sing it.  --  Money before art ? I said , meaning only to jest. -O , please do n't be another of these precious and pretentiousmusicians . I have to live . My family refuses to supportme since I left the convent.  --  The convent ? The green eyes hazed under the simple hat.  --  Yes . My mother decided that the thoroughfare to paradisewould be easier , paved with her son a priest and her  |p175daughter  a nun . I spent two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . took my final vows.  --  You ? a Carmelite nun ? With that voice ? The girl rubbed her prayerbook and lowered her eyes : -O , I tried . But I just did n't have the vocation . I was n't good enough or strong enough . You have to be superhuman ; I 'm not . I 'd lie in my cell at night and know I was simply too proud to bend to the will of God . . . that far , anyhow . I was going mad with the discipline . I 'm just not humble enough ; no one who wants to be a singer is . So when I caught myself lying three times to the mistress of novices , I asked to be sent back to the world , and they sent me . Here I am . Sometimes I wish I 'd stayed with the Carmelites and let them break my will ... .  --  Once I thought of becoming a priest . So I know what you mean . Anyone who wants to be an artist is the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and ears . I get to the point sometimes where a Bach fugue seems to me more lovely than the Beatific Vision could possibly be . Blasphemy , I know ; I willingly and perversely invite damnation . Now if I were just a stone mason , a juke box would feast my ears and a comic book my eyes , and I could devote more attention to the corporal works of mercy ... .  --  Yes , I understand what you mean , the girl said , and her whisper got so excited it seemed to echo in the empty church . When I was in compline , or supposed to be sewing , or listening to the reading of the Church Fathers in refectory , a Handel aria would come to me and blot out everything . ... But the Carmelites did something to my vanity . I no longer take an interest in pretty dresses . That may be something . I no longer change my style every season , as Paris tells me to.  --  I think you dress both sensibly and elegantly . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the simple suit gave her something by its severity . Her eyes burned , and she used almost no lip rouge . But something in her face had been touched by her novitiate ; the Carmelites had already destroyed something in her . And she had n't gone far enough to achieve the white drowsy peace of old nuns . Withdrawing from her final vows had left a hauntedness in her face , the searching expression of one who has had a glimpse of self-annihilation in God , and has refused to bow her head . She was n't in heaven or in hell ; she was in limbo.  --  So now , she said , I must support myself as a singer , or face ending up in a madhouse . I have n't really returned to the world . And the world , after my exile , appalls me . I was chary of compliments to aspiring musicians . I regardedmy art as some do their religion . But I was aware of no sugared hypocrisy when I said to this girl :  --  Why , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended.  --  Thank you . And do you know , my keenness to be a good singer causes me to commit sins against the Holy Ghost , which I feel obliged to make a matter for confession ? I sneer to myself when I have to sing succulent nineteenth century hymns to the Blessed Virgin . And there are people and priests who lap them up who are a hundred times more virtuous than I. . . . But there 's a schism today existing between art and religion . They 've taken different paths , and I 'm queasy about the whole business . Because the Church can be so magnificent ! Why do n't they use the wonderful liturgical music produced for them centuries ago instead of all this juicy trash ? Not for months had I had what might be called a conversation ; I leaned toward the girl :  --  I agree with you . And I also guess why you left the convent . There are other ways of serving God than as a cloistered nun . Ca n't one serve Him with a voice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , I really do n't know . I was taught that when you have great riches or a great gift , you make an heroic act of humility by denying yourself the use of them.  --  Masochistic nonsense , I said , quite loudly . The girl looked shocked :  --  I gather you 're not very devout ?  --  No.  --  Do you serve God with your great talent ?  --  I suppose not . I suspect I use it for the purpose of higher seduction ... .  --  I rather enjoy talking to you . But you were reared a Catholic ?  --  Of course . It gives one a springboard into life or death , or what-have-you.  --  I fear you underestimate the Church . She 's probably at work deep down inside you even now , though you say you 've strayed . It always works , once you 've been exposed to it . I was a trifle disturbed ; she had some of the missionary zeal of my mother.  --  I 'm still fasting , the girl said . I must have some breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in some-thing ? Now I 'd had much experience with deluded girl vocalists at parties , but this time I knew she would n't whip out some hiccoughing coloratura air that she would murder . I grinned and waited while she extracted from a shabby briefcase Mozart 's Exsultate , Jubilate . We put our teeth into it at once , without more ado . She was an effortless singer from arduous training . She shaped her phrases with an authority that seemed impromptu ; and I knew it was the fruit of long years of application . I grew so excited with the incandescence of her performance that I turned two pages at once . Her voice was n't huge , but so exquisitely placed that even her pianissimo came through my accompaniment like threads of platinum . She sang with her head rather far back , withp178scarcely a motion of chin or throat ; all the tones throughout her entire range seemed to be produced from some focus about two feet in front of her sinuses . And the expression of her face was that of one rationally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do but shake her hand , which was large , dry , and cold.  --  Would it be irreverent if I said My God in this place ? I 've never heard it better done.  --  Thank you . My name is Mary . People who make music together get to know one another almost instantly .  --  Mine is David . I could n't let her go to breakfast until she 'd done O Sleep , Why Dost Thou Leave Me ? ' There was almost nothing in her singing I could cavil at , which rather hurt my pride . And as we were going down from the choir loft ( I forgot to turn off Malvina 's blower ) , I realized I had n't thought of Isobel for an hour . While she was sleeping across the street , I had been taking with this girl the purest of pleasures , a headiness I had never experienced with Isobel . Nor would she understand . In the cloister Father Russo was walking and reading his breviary . Two little slum boys with an obvious crush on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were chasing the shadow of his cassock . He raised his biretta to Mary and me :  --  Ah there , Miss Desmond ! And ben tomato , Mr Murray ! My , but you two are highbrow ! Give me Turna a Surriento any day . I heard you whooping it up in the House of God ... . I was mildly offended to be tumbled from my private heaven :  --  Well , Father , now you understand why I ca n't play at your Boy Scout rallies.  --  Yes , Mr Murray , the young priest said placidly . We all know you 're an artist . But Our Divine Lord condescended to ride on an ass . . . .  |p179Outside  in the street Mary Desmond laughed a little , and took my arm . Somehow I 'd never imagined she could laugh , and the way she leaned on me was devoid of nuance , save that of friendship , for the wave of musical intercourse still billowed between us.  --  Of course he 's right , Mary said . Jesuits always are.  --  But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we could all do with a bit more of that emotion.  --  Ah , the Carmelites have left a mark on you.  --  Yes . Do you resent it ? I did n't answer . I knew only that I 'd had my first fun in a long while  --  fun of the chaste and passionate sort I 'd had sitting at my mother 's piano when I was four and picking out a tune . And I knew I did n't want Mary Desmond to go away just now.  --  Why do n't you have breakfast with me ? I live in this alley . She said , rather fussily , like a woman long unused to the company of men :  --  I see you 're not only fast on the keyboard ... . Yet she still held my arm as we walked into Mr Kubelik 's courtyard : all the alley women noted our triumphal progress ; Isobel would hear all about it before twilight . And Mrs Kubelik looked out frowningly from her apartment ; as usual , she was balancing checkbooks . As I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed the difference between Mary Desmond 's odor and my mistress 's . She smelled of soap and cologne . She took off her modest hat . I unlocked the door of our bedroom ; Isobel was still dormant on her left side . Then I set about making what breakfast I knew how to get . I carried orange juice , eggs , bacon , and coffee to Mary , who was sitting absolutely tranquilin the living room . I remembered how Isobel fidgeted , whereas Miss Desmond sank almost trancelike into whatever position she found herself . I noticed that Mary had tinyp180breasts , long arms , and long legs . It was her complexion that gave her the fey look . And I was delighted that she lit into her breakfast with avidity.  --  You 're not married ? she said , buttering marmalade on her toast.  --  Not yet.  --  Yet there 's a woman in this house.  --  There is . She did n't ask me whether it was mother , sister , or mistress , but I could tell by the leverage of her wrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not all Carmelite nuns , I said gently.  --  No . I heard the hinge on our bedroom door creak , and Isobel stood in the doorway of our parlor , wearing her newest housecoat , her eyes fuzzy with sleep , her hair tattered , her cheeks drained . O , she said . I thought I heard voices . Then , in an irony heavier than I 'd ever heard :  --  Pardon me , you two .. . Almost instantly Mary Desmond rose , and did not take my hand :  --  Thank you for church . And for the music . And for the breakfast.  --  You must come often , Isobel said , standing aside to let her pass . David could in no way account for Isobel 's increasing ascend-ancy over him . It had turned from a love-battle into a chessgame , each spying out the other 's moves . In the beginningwhen he had hurt her , or she him , it could be made up inkisses or in little treats ' ; but now that their love ( or theirhatred ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit , not just an apple . Certain it was that Isobelp181now exacted tribute of him : she was surer of herself than when they 'd first gone to live together . By September she had stalked out every area of his personality , as a cat gets to know her predilected house . He made almost no effort to shield himself against her inroads . When he tried the same tactics on her , she retreated into tears and imprecations . ( The foulness of her mouth , which had once excited him in bed , now was an open sewer in casual conversation. )  --  I hardly ever object when you 're being unfair to me ... .  --  It only seems unfair , she said . Because you 're not used to giving , hon. It hurts . Most effectively now she could employ the techniques of the strike upon him . He was defenseless . Displeased , she would leave the house in a mess , with her skirts and sweaters strewn around . Or she could wield her utmost weapon , denying him physical access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . Often he marched out to West End restaurants ; and she , having won her victory , would retire to bed with a bottle ; and he would return , undecided whether to slap her as she lay snoring , or to clear out then and there . Bribes and blackmail became a regular institution , no longer employed simply when he felt like rewarding her for something she 'd done well  --  a week of good cooking , or an effective party for his acquaintances . No , he was now so pregnablethat Isobel could demand extras and concessions as a matter of course . One was her outing , every Saturday evening , which came to be known in bitter jest as the Cook 's Night Out . David was to take her to any restaurant of her choice . And a subsidiary rule that she passed in her parliament-of-onewas that she might say anything she pleased , and he was not to rebut her . On Cook 's Night Out she spent a good two hours dressing , while David desultorily played the piano , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . He could shower ,  |p182shave  , and dress in one-sixth of her required time . And when they were to go out , he was nervous ; he could n't sit down and diddle his thumbs . She was determined to outdo in her own way his stiff collars , pastel shirts , and French cuffs . Often when she was appareled and ready , she would change her mind , take off her dress , and begin her toilette all over again . This would madden him , and he would calm his nerves with another highball ; her Cook 's Night Out became endurableonly when he was half-tight.  --  For whom are you dressing ? Certainly not for me any more ... And she , sitting on the bed , fastening her garters :  --  On her night off the cook must make herself glamorous for the outside world . After all , if you could have Miss Desmondup here for breakfast , the cook has the right to do a little flirting on her night off ... . ( A dozen times a day now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she liked to say ) :  --  I think I 'll leave you , and that skinny scarecrow can move in . ( But he knew now that Isobel would never leave him without the aid of a pistol . Mary had called him once on the phone , when Isobel was out shopping . ) Finally she was ready in a fall frock and coat he was still paying for . He obeyed the old rule , made in the first month of their love , of kissing her in the corridor of the little house.  --  Like me tonight ? she said , withdrawing from the embrace.  --  Sure , Mike . ( For lately she 'd been demanding praise. )  --  Am I prettier than that Mary Desmond ?  --  I 've told you a thousand times I like Mary for her voice .  --  That 's what he said , she said in brazen imitation of the old burlesque quip . As he locked the door , she fell back on a joke of their old days :  |  --  Got everything ?  --  Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him raw . He suggested walking to the restaurant in the September evening , but she said they must flag a taxi . Outside New York taxis to him were a criminal folly . Isobel had picked up the notion that a lady goes nowhere on her own feet.  --  It 's the Cook 's Night Out , she said , and hailed one before he could stop her . Though she shamed and scened him into taking her out for supper other nights than Saturday , on the Cook 's Night Out she refused to consider anything but the most expensive restaurants . Places where the food was excellent and cheap she would n't dream of ; she had built up a list of three it was smart to be seen in . Tonight she directed the cab driver to Pierre 's , though they might have walked there in ten minutes.  --  I thought it was the man 's province to tell the cabbie where to go ... .  --  Cook 's Night Out , hon !  --  Does that mean you can get up . on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds are barred . She was most excited , nestling back in the taxi ; he saw that she envisioned herself as a diva going to a champagne and lobster supper . At Pierre 's the headwaiter bowed to her :  --  Ah , good evening , good evening , Mrs Murray !  --  Bon soir , Armand , said Isobel in an indescribable accent.  --  You seem to have spread my name all over town , David said , helping her off with her coat . You have made me the typical meek American husband . . . .  --  Ha-ha , hon ! If the shoe fits . . . There was no vacant table ; so she sat down behind a bronze cocktail tray and began to make audible remarks about everybody in the place . She ordered a Pink Lady . She did all sorts of stage business with the huge cellophanedp184menu , pretending it was a fan . And she laughed too often , her gales cutting like a razor across the subdued hum of the dining room . It was a room of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to do over their apartment . So far he had resisted , but he knew she was having daily conferences with the most chi-chi interior decorator in the city. -O , how smart , she said , sipping her drink through a straw.  --  And for the sixth time let me tell you it looks like a cross between Turandot and the Five-Year-Plan. -O , hon , you stick to your music and let me cultivate the visual arts , said Isobel . After another Pink Lady for her and another highball for him , they were shown to a free table by the maitre d'hotel , whose civilities were all for Madame Murray . And David saw , at the other end of the dining room , the entire crowd munching away on duck a la presse . And further , Miss Mary Desmond was sitting among them , aloof , and picking at her plate . He wondered who had made contact with whom . Isobel speedily saw where his eyes were , heard the intake of his breath.  --  I forbid you to go over there.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? David got up and walked across the room . He was fairly high after four highballs , determined to invade the sanctity of the Cook 's Night Out.  --  Ho-ho , fella , said Dick Dobbs , with a napkin under his chin . We got bonuses and we 're tying on the feedbag.  --  We 've discovered Pierre 's , said Louisa , winking at David.  --  And I am happy to report , said Olivia , there is no gentlemen'sagreement here . I am as welcome as Josephine Baker in Paris.  --  After this sumptuous chow , said Tom Bernstein , we 're going to have a memorable evening in the theater . I havep185wangled seven tickets ( countem ) from my paper for that new revue , Up Yours.  --  We were betting , mumbled Meg , whether you 'd condescendto come over , Mister High-Hat.  --  Sweetie , said Harry Korchinski in his soft way , your Izzy is glaring at you . After shaking their hands , David got down to the real business he 'd come for : he stood behind Mary Desmond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tubes and leather , like a dentist 's . She made no attempt to acknowledge him . He murmured to her over the jollity of the crowd :  --  I did n't know you were acquainted with this gay group ... . I had to find out about you , you see , she answered , never raising her eyes ... .  --  Well , now you know . And what do you think ?  --  Frankly , I 'm more than disappointed ... . He trembled and blushed and began to move away , but Louisa caught his hand :  --  Ducky , it 's not so mysterious , our knowing Mary . We are all aware that a great religious revival is going on in the United States . Time Magazine says so . So we were more than delighted to have Mary join our crowd . She preaches to us on the Emerald Isle and the Virgin Mary . It 's too bad the Holy Year is over , for we 're ready to pack up bag and baggage for a pilgrimage to Rome ... .  --  No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  The only trouble is , said Tom Bernstein , I ca n't very well uncircumcize myself , can I now ? Mary drank a glass of ice water to veil her embarrassment , and David walked back to his table . Isobel 's eyes were afire ; she was as tense as a porcelain doll . And he saw that she had purposely upset a water glass over his cover . So instead of sitting beside her ; he moved his soggy cigarettes and took the place opposite her ; his back was to the crowd.  |  --  I do n't think I 've ever been so humiliated , she said loudly . People all around them were looking at the dripping table , and David got redder :  --  Humiliated ? You once said they were your friends ! -O , damn you ! You did n't go over there to see them . You know what I 'm going to do this coming Monday ? I 'm going to study voice to make myself into a damn coloratura soprano like your chum Mary ... . He all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke in a whisper :  --  Shut up , or I 'll take you home immediately.  --  You do , and I 'll break every dish in the china closet ... . Once again he tried , but his sense of her injustice was stinging like pepper in his eyes :  --  Look , where 's all this squabbling getting us ? Have n't you noticed that we 're fighting more and more ? She stamped out her cigarette in a modern brass ashtray :  --  Honey , you call this fighting ? Why we have n't even begun ... .  --  How much longer do you think I 'm going to put up with your nonsense ? She opened her small red mouth :  --  Get the hell away from me.  --  With pleasure . You 've made me lose , among other things , my appetite . He was rising from the table , feeling sick in heart and stomach.  --  Leave me some money , she said hoarsely.  --  I 'll not leave you a cent . You can wash dishes to pay for your supper . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She surprised him by lowering her voice :  --  David Murray , you leave me some money , or by God I 'll throw a super-scene right here and now . You 'll be in all  |p187the  gossip columns tomorrow . Well-known Concert Pianist Publicly Shamed By Bitch . Cringing as he had the day he heard his father yell at his mother , he took a ten-dollar bill from his pocket and passed it to her under the tablecloth.  --  I am beginning to pity you , Isobel.  --  Get out . After he had gone , more deliberately than she 'd ever seen him do anything , Isobel was almost immediately sorry and frightened . She marked the crowd commenting on his exit with little jeers and boos , and she knew that Mary Desmond was looking very hard across the restaurant at her . Isobel felt tears burning her eyelids ; she considered running after David . Then she ordered dinner , saying to the headwaiter with great mustered dignity :  --  My husband has been taken ill ... . She had onion soup , capon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialty at Pierre 's . She drank also a bottle of 1937 burgundy , feeling as though she was dining in a flood-lighted department store window . She forced down every mouthful of the fine food , washing it down with copious wine . Then she ordered crepes suzette for a sweet , coffee , and a goblet of white creme de menthe in crushed ice . Attracted by the flames of the pancakes , a drunken college boy in evening dress left his post-football party and stood swaying over the chair that David had voided.  --  I 'd like to discuss the football score with you , he said uncertainly . Probably because you 're so pretty .. . She tried to look through him but could n't . He had the same delicacy of features , indicative of a dying social order she had never known before she met David . His hair had escaped in one lock that hung over his eyes . She tried to say something about her husband 's being called to the phone , but the cocktails and the wine had paralyzed her throat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Let 's go for a drive in the arborway and talk about football , my little quarterback , the boy was murmuring . With one last effort Isobel drained her coffee and liqueur , clutched up her change , brushed by the boy , staggered across the restaurant and fell weeping into Louisa 's lap . David walked a long while in the sweet September night . He looked in shop windows where Isobel had made her little deals to beautify herself and their little house . His anger was now that cold calculating one of poisoners and embezzlers ; he thought of nothing but of how to get out from under . Their growing incompatibility after the brief months of physical attachment was like a widening railroad track under a rushing train . He could n't go back to his mother , and he could n't go on living with Isobel . It all seemed mercilessly clear now , with the four drinks on his empty stomach , that she was using him only for her own security . Her new passion for interior decoration was an index to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do all day long but plot ; she would tear down one room after another of the little house and redo it . Eventually she would want him to buy her a house . She was like a pelican , building ever bigger and more ornate nests , only to betray the truth that she had no egg to brood on . In a grimy part of the city David passed the Sawbuck Bar . He had n't been inside for years . Through its swinging doors passed a pavane of sailors and their suitors for an evening . There emerged the sphincteral sound of a Hammond organ burping out the waltz from Faust . This bar promised noise and inexpensive alcohol to numb the consciousness of an industrial society for at least one more Saturday night . He went in and stood at the nearest end : almost a quarter of a mile in the distance he could see the blur of what looked like a thousand identical faces peering over their beers . Tinselp189and bunting were everywhere in the Sawbuck Bar . The Hammondorganist , a virtuoso of Mammon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twinkling with sequins . He remembered her well ; she changed gowns between shifts , when a live dance orchestra took over . She 'd been there ten , fifteen years ago . Her name  --  Zula  --  was emblazoned on a velvet standard that covered the loudspeakers of her organ . In Zula 's face was concentrated all the grime and sadness of the cotton mills ; one of her gilded slippers dipped on the expression pedal , the other pumped up and down in fourths and fifths the booming bass that supported a belching tremolo boop , from what was once called the king of instruments . Zula beamed on her clientele . She played from memory , except when some sailor brought her a showtune he 'd written . And she did n't like the barflies to sing in chorus until closing time . For such was her artist 's integrity . David , over a beer , contemplated the difference between bars for the rich and bars like the Sawbuck , this last a hangoverfrom the days when the Builders of America went and put up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of getting drunk . They still did it with zest at the Sawbuck . There were still fights and jagged broken bottles scrunched in men 's faces . And anyone who threatened to make trouble was ejected into the street by a fat yet effeminatebouncer . The Sawbuck 's clients , besides sailors , were laborers who came to damp their edges with raw cheap beer . They loved to beat up screaming queans , or to cry when Zula played Irish songs . David looked over the heads of the multitude to the paddocksthat were here called booths . Here sat ladies of the town and poor couples a-courting  --  for Woolworth girls and their dates it was a treat to drink at the Sawbuck : never a dull moment ! For love here was promised if not free , and the plainclothesmen who stood behind every tenth drinker joined in the saturnalia with the best of them . David Murrayp190found himself all but envying the simple joys of the place : you swigged your beer ( or your whisky , if this was payday ) and you roughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in overalls and filthy fingernails was looking at David 's hands , then back to his own . After ten minutes ' shyness and preparation , he spoke to David , seeminglycasually , weighting his words with musk :  --  Where does a fella get a job for tonight ?  --  I 'm sure I do n't know . The laborer treated him to a beer , over David 's protests ;  --  Ya know what I 'm talkin about , bud . Doya or don'tya ? Ya might n't believe it to look at me , bud , but I like it reciprocal ... .  --  I do n't know what you 're talking about.  --  Well , excuse me for livin , the young man said , and hulked down the bar for more amenable company . It was almost closing time , and the congregation ordered extra beers , which would be whisked off the bar if they did n't finish them on the hour . The police and plainclothesmen girded themselves for action . Zula was honking out the Serenade ' from the Student Prince , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what sociologist had ever said there was no popular culture in the United States . Perhaps it was n't Mediterranean ; but it was rather like Walt Whitman on a bat , who heard America singing ; the varied carols he heard ... . Someone had slipped into the bar beside him , and without turning David knew who it was ; there was only one knee which pressed like that.  --  Hiya , dopey.  --  Hello , Fred.  --  Dopey , I 'm drunk.  --  I wish I were .. . Isobel 's brother looked as he did when he was tight on Okinawa , the look of a handsome little dog in a den of  |p191thieves  , the look of one who squanders tenderness on the world.  --  Ya gettin fed up with my sis , Fred Joy said tentatively . I toldya ya would ... .  --  Honestly , I do n't know what to think , David said , looking away from the boy 's puzzled gaze . Later , intending an act of mercy , he put Fred , who was passing out , into a taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street Alley . How often , O , how often , have I stood aside ( or let someone else stand aside ) while an apartment door , a portal to a private place , was being opened ! It was so when teachers I loved took me into their confidence at teas , and it was true in my first instances of sex , when I took someone , or someonetook me to a room with a purpose . I stood aside for Fred Joy to enter my house . I did n't know whether Isobel had found her way home yet  --  and I did n't much care . Fred seemed more drunk than he was ( he used to pretend to be stewed in the navy : it gave him the advantage of guilelessness ) , but his head struck my shoulder in passing . He stood blinking in the night light of the corridor , an institution of Isobel 's , a shaded beacon to welcome us home in the first days of our love . But I sensed she was n't at home now ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut the door and put on the night chain ; Fred was looking at me and tickling his crotch like a peevish child :  --  Dopey , show me to the little boys ' room.  --  You were here once before , I said , pointing down the hall . I lit the lamps in our parlor and sat down in my deep chair , listening to the acrid hiss of Fred 's uncertain aim in the bathroom . After a while her brother came back and stood uncertainly in the doorway , tugging at his zipper :  |  --  Gee , it 's pretty here . I wish it was all yours . But she 's here too.  --  You know perfectly well it 's more her house than mine . He flung himself down on the couch , putting his loafers up on it , which would have irked Isobel , being contrary to Rule Number 82 . And he began to pluck at the gladioli floating in a brass plate on the coffee table :  --  You 're breaking one of the house rules , Fred . Isobel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She rulesya , does n't she ? Ya used to be so independent . Now ya remind me of the henpecked husband in tha comic books ... .  --  I think you 're interfering ... .  --  Dopey , I was born to interfere ! I watch out for people that ca n't watch out for themselves ! . . . Look , you got all the education , but I got a hell of a sight more than you . And I say the worst deal ya coulda dealt yaself was to get tangled up with my sis . But like Shakespeare says , ya made ya bed and ya got ta lie in it . I lit a cigarette with a foggy sense of apprehension :  --  You 're furious about the whole business , Fred . I ca n't decide whether you 're madder at me or at her ... . He sat up and regarded me with bleary affection :  --  Dopey , I do n't know myself . But I 'm PO 'd at both of ya .... Get me a drink , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already ? -O Gawd ! That 's what they all say whenya really wanta talk to em . You and I ai n't really chewed the fat for six years now . Tonight let 's . She 's not here . We can get drunk for ole time 's sake . Remember Okinawa ? I was happy withya then . And now I 'm lonesome , lonesome , and I haveta pass my time watchin out for others.  --  Fred , I do n't wish it were 1945 again.  --  Then y'are a fool . We had somethin then . And since , we 've both worked to destroy it . I guess it was you whop193wanted to muck it up . I 've toldya ya had only to say the word , and we 'd back in ' 45 again . We shoulda bought a little boat , you an me , an sailed the seven seas . Gawd , am I nuts ? Or is everybody else ?  --  We were children then , Fred . He lurched up and tried to light a cigarette from his garish homemade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accusation ? Sure we were kids in 1945 . And from what I 've seen after leavin the navy , I 'd sooner stay a child than most a the grownups I 've met . . . . Dopey , you ai n't a child and you ai n't a man . And my sis ai n't a girl and she ai n't a woman . Ya both want the freedom of kids and the responsibility of grownups.  --  I had n't known that all this was preying on your mind ....  --  Dopey , dopey ! here ya are settin out to be a great piano player , and ya ai n't got the millionth idea of what goes on in the heart of a guy or a gal ... . ( I could n't help taking on the injured expression of one who hears the whole truth about himself in a court of law ) :  --  We just are n't the same people we were then , Fred . Maybe I 'm more mature . Maybe you are ... .  --  I would n't take any bets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look , dopey , can I flop here for the night ?  --  Isobel never allowed any of my own friends to stay the night before . But I suppose with her own brother .. . He was almost asleep ; he lay back on the couch with his hands under his head : -O , I got a clear picture of you two . I see a flea . Then I see this silver thumb squashin the flea . I leave it to your mature imagination to guess which is which . He was about to roll over on the coffee table ; so I helped him to his feet ; he toppled against me and kept his face nestled on my shoulder for a moment :  --  Easy does it ; easy does it . . . . Remember how neither  |p194of  us got stewed at the same time ? You 'd hang on one night , and me the next . We looked out for each other then , did n't we ? And no one looks out forya now . Because ya have ta be known ta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward our cool bedroom ; the light on , I saw that as usual Iosbel had failed to make the bed ; the sheets trailed like a tent . Fred joy looked at the rumpus ; a start of sobriety flinched in his eyes ; he twisted his hand from my arm :  --  Dopey , I ai n't gon na sleep here . An do n't ask me why .  --  You 'll be more comfortable here than on the couch .  --  Ya gon na undress me , dopey ? I made something of order out of the messed bed ; then I leaned against the wall and watched him groggy on the counterpane , his head rolling on his chest.  --  Ya gettin stuffier as ya get older , he said , fiddling with with his moccasins . Soon ya gon na be fat , and I wo n't followyaaround no more like a German police dog .. . -O , Fred , Fred ! I 've come to the conclusion that people follow other people around only for their own advantage . He was throwing shoes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the wrong things . There 's people an people . Even in the same family .. . ( For he was one of Nature 's gentlemen who keep things bottled up inside them till someone  --  or alcohol  --  smashes the preserve jar , and the sweet jelly blobs on the floor. )  --  Tell me , do ya sleep in pajamas now ? Ya did n't usedta.  --  I 'm unchanged in that respect , I said , reaching for the light switch.  --  Do n't go yet , his voice came drowsy in the dusk . Sit here a while and skoot the skit with me , dopey. . . .  --  Goodnight , Fred . I went back to the living room and undressed by Septembermoonlight ; his voice called me ; I heard a plaintive dopey several times , dying away as sleep numbed him . I heard thep195whisper of his body finding the right crevass in the big bed  --  a trait too of his twin sister 's  --  and as I lay down on the divan in my shorts , I heard at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the play of moonlight on the ceiling . It would be the last warm night of September ; the windows were open on Fruit Street Alley . I listened to the exploding vitality of a Saturday night ; the beatings , the swapping bed partners , the pinochle games . Carmela , defying the solstice , was doing her wash and making canneloni when everyone else was celebrating . From the apartment above my head I heard squashed merriment trickling down from Meg and Louisa 's . I heard Dick Dobbs ho-ho as he demonstrated a rubber dollar bill . The last thing I noticed before I fell asleep was that the moonlight stalked the floor sedately . How ? Why , chastely , like Mary Desmond . It was almost dawn when I awoke , stiff from dozing without a blanket . But then again it was n't stiffness . For my hands and feet had been tied to the divan springs with rope , and I was stretched out Procrustean , unable to move more than an inch in any direction . And I had had dreams of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No , I was actually fettered , like Gulliver , to the studio couch . And Fred was sitting wide awake in my chair , smiling in a way I 'd never seen before.  --  Good morning , dopey.  --  Cut this rope , you idiot . I never knew you were given to practical jokes ... .  --  I watchedya sleep , dopey . ( His voice was furry . ) I ai n't watchedya sleep in six years . Ya used to be so quiet . Now ya twitch and mutter . Why , I wonder ?  --  Set me free , Fred , and stop grinning like that . . . . He arose and came toward me in the gray chill light . And I understood an ambiguous tumescence in his hand , with which he 'd been toying obscenely in his lap . It was n't what I thought at first waking , but a length of rubber hose , whichp196Isobel and I had concocted to drain and siphon Mr Kubelik 's sink , when it backed up . Fondling this limp blackjack , Fred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him.  --  I 'm gon na beatya , dopey . It 's the only way . I 've thought about it for months . You 're off the beam , see , an if anyone can setya right , it 's me , for I knowya an I loveya . Forgive me , and hate me ifya like ... . The rubber hose flashed across my chest and thudded on my ribs . I gnashed my teeth , for I 'd never really experienced physical violence before , and I opened and closed my eyes to see , and yet not to see the flexions of his frame bending to punish me , cutting a swath like a mower ; I had to know when to prepare myself for wincing . A world of agony pummeledat me . And his voice was as inexorable as his flailings :  --  This is for my sister Isobel , to whom ya done wrong , whatever ya think ... . The hose plumped on my shins :  --  And this is for the love ya had and did n't take ... . And across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the love ya have , an have betrayed ... . And a swish across the naked upstretched backs of my arms :  --  And this is for all good guys gone wrong ... . And a scourge across my thighs :  --  And this is for all who never try an understand ... . And two mighty switches across my flanks :  --  And this is for you and for me . O , dopey , I think I 'm gon na kill ya ... . And perhaps he did , for I sank into a swoon as black as the hose . I remembered their taking me from Pierre 's restaurant in acab . In fact there were two cabs : the crowd rode in the first , and in the second there was me and that girl named Maryp197Desmond , whom David brought to breakfast that morning at the little house . There was also Harry Korchinski , who kept patting my forehead with a handkerchief moistened in ice water . During the ride across town to Meg and Louisa 's I fell into a doze , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Is she a candidate for Alcoholics Anonymous ? -O , Izzy 's not so bad as she 's painted.  --  Well , it offends me to see a woman drunk ... . I fell back into my stupor before I could decide whether she really loathed me , or was just pulling the virtuous act before Harry . Next thing I knew I was feeling better except for a headache , and Meg and Louisa were helping me up the stairs to their place . Dick Dobbs was goosing me from behind to persuade me to move faster.  --  Ducky , Louisa said panting , you used to get drunk much more prettily than you do now.  --  I 'm getting old , I said . ( And in my fog it occurred to me that this observation was true. )  --  Well , it comes to us all , dearie , said Louisa . Mary Desmond did n't especially want to propel me , and I did n't much care for the idea of being touched by her long cold hands ; yet I permitted her to crutch me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd bustled about lighting lamps . Their apartment was as filthy as ever . David used to reproach me on my housekeeping , but I was a Dutch housewife compared to Meg and Louisa.  --  Do n't you wish to go downstairs to your own place ? Mary Desmond said to me in her too soft voice.  --  It 's hardly your business to read my mind , I said , freeing myself.  --  I 'm sorry , she said . I only wanted to help . ( I already had that one 's number from some of my Mom 's friends  --  those washed-out biddies who go around doing goodp198because they ca n't get a man , and spreading over everything a gooey chocolate icing of Catholic charity . ) Tom Bernstein sat down on the couch with a book of the Best Plays of 1949 :  --  Get drinks , kiddies . Because I 'm going to read aloud from a witty comedy of manners ... .  --  We 've drunk up all the liquor ration for the weekend , Meg said sourly.  --  Then I 'll read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade . And Mary Desmond took my arm and led me into Louisa 's kitchen , littered with the remains of breakfast , lunch ; and whisky and gin jiggers from the afternoon.  --  I 'm going to make you a cup of tea , Miss Joy.  --  Well , now really ! How hospitable can you get ! ? You may not realize it , Miss Desmond , but once I was the reigningfavorite in this house . I used to know where to find the teabags ... . As she poured water into the teapot , I could n't decide whether she was poking fun at me :  --  Miss This and Miss That . . . Look , let 's be Mary and Isobel . Let 's start that way , shall we ? Right now ?  --  After all , we were introduced , I said , determined not to be Out-Great-Ladied.  --  Yes , that morning downstairs . She had a disconcertingly quiet way about her , which I envied . In spite of my alcoholic fog , I could n't miss the musical way she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment , but I sensed that she included only David in her idea of downstairs . Yet I made up my mind to be friendly :  --  Were you surprised when I butted in on you and David at breakfast ? Then I saw that she was raddling a handerchief between  |p199her  fingers ; so I gathered she was n't so much at ease as she pretended.  --  Isobel , let 's be frank till the water for your tea boils ... . I was n't brought up to the idea of a man and woman living together outside the bonds of holy wedlock . And neither were you ... .  --  My crowd does n't discuss religion , I said airily . We do n't think it civilized . ( Tom Bernstein once said this . ) Mary smiled , but I knew she was vexed :  --  My dear Isobel , the world would be a lot better off if more people did discuss religious values . Discuss them , I mean , not argue about them . For there 's nothing to argue about . I myself have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of tolerance ... . Before I could curb my tongue ( it was Pierre 's wine ) , I said :  --  You talk like David , or like his mother , a very good friend of mine . You three must be birds of a feather.  --  No , we are n't . I have n't the pleasure of knowing Mrs Murray . But David and I do n't speak the same language . Perhaps once we might have . As children.  --  What you 're saying , of course , is that you do n't approve of David and me living together.  --  Of course I do n't . If I pretended to , I 'd be party to your sin.  --  Ha-ha , Miss Desmond , you 're slaying me . And who are you to pass moral judgments ? People in glass houses .. .  --  You 're misquoting , Miss Joy . Is n't it **27;6428;TOOLONG ' ? I began to pace the kitchen floor , even though my head was pounding . Then in the brilliant recklessness of my incipient hangover :  --  Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in love with David Murray.  |  --  Isobel , I could swear to you that I 'm not . At least not now . He 's too far gone . And you 're to blame for some of it .  --  Did n't you ever . . . ? I began . But she was pouring boiling water over the teabags , and she set before us two cups of steamy golden brew . I had to laugh that Meg and Louisa had a special blend of Oolong that tasted of straw and myrrh : naturally I 'd never drunk tea at their place before . But to prick her more , I staked out my claim , my vested interest , saying rather sulkily :  --  David knows I always take mine with milk.  --  Flow should I know what David knows of you ? she retortedmildly getting out a punctured can of condensed milk . While I stirred my cup , I thought it about time to pose the old high school question :  --  Frankly , what do you think of me , Mary ? Her laugh did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought a lot about you , Isobel . . . . Well , you 're very pretty ( when you are n't drunk ) , but of course your beauty wo n't last forever , as I know you know . . . . Then , I do n't know whether you have intelligence , rather than animal cunning . . . . I imagine you jeer at everything you do n't understand . . . . But I suppose the most important thing is that you 're really not a woman ... .  --  Pardon me . Now you 're being just plain insulting ... .  --  It was you who used the word frankly .... My dear , you could do with a little more introspection . I learned it when I was in the Carmelite novitiate ... . I swallowed my tea with a certain poise : - O , so that 's it ! ? Well , since you 're so interested , let me tell you that he still has n't cut himself free from the religious umbilical cord . And you have no idea how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentieth century . . . . It was my moment , I believed . I swept out of the kitchen , feeling flushed and better , and rejoined the crowd . I do n't think I was ever so brilliant as I was that night . Maryp201Desmond , in the course of my witticisms , smiled at me rather sadly . Probably because she was n't as pretty as I , could n't scintillate in conversation . Poor little DP from a nunnery , trying to snack at life ! I saw that she was sick and David was sick too . But I was sound . After a while Mary Desmond left the party , saying she had to go to early Mass . We all sighed with relief . And I may say that that evening I was re-admitted to full membership in the crowd , with the rank of Campfire Girl , First Class . I slept at Meg and Louisa 's . And Sunday morning about noon , going back to our apartment , I found David unconsciousand all welted on the studio couch . Since my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God rest all their souls ! ) passed on to a better life , I 've always known by heart the visiting hours in our city hospitals . Not out of morbidity , the way many widows gloat over funerals not of their own people ; but , please God , out of Catholic charity . For it 's one of the corporal works of mercy to visit the sick , is n't it ? So there was only a lag of a day or two before I learned that my lamb was at the Massachusetts General . I do n't remember who told me ( nobody ever tells a mother anything ) ; I think I sensed it , or was told by Father Rushton , or one of the cloth whose province it was to keep in touch with his parishioners in that hospital . Anyway , I haunted the dreary antiseptic corridors at two the following afternoon . The receptionist told me , sleek as though she worked for a dentist :  --  Mr Murray has expressly stipulated that no visitors be admitted.  --  But my dear young lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  All that I am permitted to tell you , said the brazen thing ,  |p202returning  to her files and her telephones , is that Mr Murray is not in danger . I began to debate what sort of scene would be most effectivein the inhuman frigidity of a modern hospital . ( I had my twins in a little sanatorium run by the good nuns . ) Just then a young intern marched by , starched and handsome , with a sort of steely compassion in his eyes I knew I could appeal to :  --  What seems to be the trouble , madam ?  --  Wants to see her son , one David Murray , the receptionist-nursesaid coldly . ( I wondered what she 'd be like , with her Alabama drawl , when she had sons. )  --  Yes , please help me , doctor , I cried . He took my hand in his cool scrubbed one and led me to a bench under a neon light in the waiting room . I know I looked haggard under its cruel scanning of my face , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet I was frightened , as though I stood on a glaring subway platform , alone at midnight.  --  Your son is my patient , Mrs Murray . We are a mutual admiration society . I think he 's a very fine pianist and he says that some day I shall be a great surgeon ... .  --  In the name of heaven , doctor ! Is my lamb in danger ?  --  Not really , Mrs Murray . He claims to have got in a fight . He was beaten up , it seems , according to his story . Several bones in his right hand have been fractured . I do n't see how it could have been done in a fight . The rest of his body appears to have been flogged with something soft and fibrous , which would n't leave much of a mark , as we know from gangster films . . . . I could n't help making the Sign of the Cross , though the young intern seemed to disapprove of the gesture :  --  My God , doctor ! What will that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't decide whether out of condolence or recognition of my crossing myself :  |  --  I am afraid , Mrs Murray , he will never play as well as we have heard him on other occasions . The hand will always be lame ... . Feeling faint , I stood up from the bench and fingered my bag :  --  Doctor , I must see my boy ! It 's only natural . . . my own flesh and blood ! .. .  --  I 'm sorry , Mrs Murray . He has specifically requested that you not be admitted . It hurts me to tell you this , believe me . But we are bound to respect the wishes of patients who have reached their majority . An American hospital is another form of big business ; the customer is always right . I was n't ashamed of the tears in my eyes , and the goodlookingintern averted his glance and twisted an amethyst ring.  --  Tell me at least one thing , doctor . Has anyone been to see my poor lamb ?  --  He has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example ?  --  I am not at liberty to divulge.  --  Was there a pretty girl with gray eyes and windblown hair , named Miss Isobel Joy ?  --  I believe I would n't be violating the secret of the confessional , Mrs Murray , if I answer that question . No , Miss Joy has not come to visit your son . Rarely have I felt so bemused as when I waited for my taxi on the steps of the hospital in the September sunlight ; the glass bricks mocked me . I was crying steadily once I 'd left the professional stare of the receptionist . Yes , mothers are always looking in from the outside ( unless they deceive themselves about their sons ) , but nobody had ever turned me away before , at least so patently . I had been with my mother when she died , and with Herb , and with Teddy , when the polio bent him double , and he sank into the white depths after that baseball game . And now my only sonp204would n't suffer me to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought of how I 'd nursed the twins through whooping cough and pneumonia and appendicitis , and how David 's little hand used to reach out to me from the shadows of his baby nightmares . It was inconceivable to me that David had been in a brawl . Even as a little boy he shrank from physical violence , unlike Teddy , even when baited or picked on . Herb showed David how to use his dukes ( as he put it ) , but I do n't remember that David ever hit back . But I now knew that Irish Americanswho do n't drink or fight are more likely to fall into sins against the Sixth Commandment . I 'd taken a maid from one of the Cape houses since David left me to shift for myself ; Priscilla let me in . Her breath told me she 'd been nipping in the pantry , and she tried immediately to distract my attention :  --  Lordy , darlin , you been bawlin your eyes out . Whateverabout ? Mister David all right ?  --  Even if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your guzzling , Priscilla ... .  --  I 've got a bad cold . An I think my liver 's conkin out . Why do n't you take out social security for me , Mrs Murray ?  --  Well , I 've got a cold in my eyes . In my bedroom I took off the coat and the new hat I 'd hoped would be cheery to visit David with in the hospital ; and after washing my eyes , I lay down on the bed . Then ( for I 'd often cried before , and learned to issue forth as though nothing had broken my heart ) I changed my dress and went to my geraniums and my sun parlor . The tea table did look nice , with Father Rushton 's favorite tarts and the spicy preserve he loved . Poor man , he never had such tarts until he got to be pastor ! During the war I 'd sent a thousand cans of meats and vegetables to the rectory ; I did n't think that ministers of God ought to suffer from food shortages like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting.  |p205At  least once a month I had Father Rushton in to drink tea with me ; for I was President of Catholic Charities at Saint Cecilia 's . ( Once it was even my privilege to entertain the Cardinal , and I still treasured a personal letter from him , with the chancery seal , telling me that if poor Herb was still alive , the archbishop would have seen to it that he be made a papal count , on his next ad Iimina visit to Rome . ) Now that Father Rushton was our pastor , he had less time to spend with me ; he used to come in several times a week . And since my expenditures as a widow were far less than when poor Herb was still in this vale of tears , I could make a greater contribution to the financial and moral welfare of Saint Cecilia 's . Dear Father Rushton had a way with serviette and teacup ; he balanced them on his knee with a grace that only schismaticAnglican clergymen are said to have . God bless him , he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other parishioners ! From the looks of many other ladies at Mass , I 'd gather our pastor was n't so much as asked whether he had a mouth on him , or would get a plate of cold clam chowder shoved in his face . He put down his teacup and wiped his lips as daintily as ever he did after his Communion at Mass.  --  Now to get down to the annual parish outing and bingo game , Mrs Murray ... .  --  Frankly , Father , I 'm all for dropping the outing and its ridiculous potato-bag races , and substituting a CommunionBreakfast. . . .  --  Ah , Mrs Murray , Mrs Murray ! You 're the old-fashioned , intellectual type of Catholic . The salt of the earth . For you the glories of the Mass and the rhythm of the liturgical year suffice . I wish that all the parish were like you .... But , Mrs Murray , except for you and a few other great ladies like Mrs Cavanaugh and Mrs Monahan , we have to put on bingo games , canasta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sacraments . America today is so secularized that Holyp206Mother Church must compete with pagan pleasures . She did n't use to have to . New we have to go to the people each day of the week , just like a referendum . Lectures , musicales , sewing circles . ( And I thought that earlier that afternoon , like Holy Mother Church , I 'd gone to my boy. )  --  And how is David ? our pastor asked , seeming to read my mind . ( The dear ascetic old man reached for another tart , almost ashamedly ! )  --  I went to the hospital to visit him this afternoon , I said , taking refuge in a half-truth . He 's not very ill ... . My pastor stood up and brushed the black felt hat Priscilla brought him , curtsying rawly and superstitiously , for she was an Irish war bride from Dublin , deserted by her husband , then a mess sergeant.  --  Well , I 'm glad he 's not really ill . Yet I agree with Bishop Sheen that sickness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one jump ahead of the Freudians and the psychiatrists . . . . Thank you for the tea , Mrs Murray , and for your continued zeal ... . But I had one more idea as I was seeing him to the door.  --  Father . . . just for a treat . . . could n't we have all the parish nuns to our outing ; that is , all who are n't cloistered ? The sisters in the parochial schools have so little fun ... . Say yes ... . Now Mrs Cavanaugh and Mrs Monahan always claimed he was brusque with them , and this time he answered me more shortly than he ever had :  --  My dear Mrs Murray , their superiors would never consent . And besides the Sisters of Notre Dame are making their annual retreat before their schools open . . . .  --  Poor dears , they have so little fun . And you priests get around in this great world ! . . .  |  --  There are many ways of serving Our Blessed Lord , Mrs Murray ... . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea caddy , oddly upset , and not just about my lamb . He was pointing out to me that the Church was men 's business , like banking and wars . And that a poor widow like me should content herself with being devout and oiling the machinery of protocol and ritual . Priscilla was about to clear the tea things , and I was about to don my hat and step around the corner for Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament when the doorbell rang . I was n't expecting anyone . My maid returned , her cap over one ear :  --  Young lady named Miss Mary Desmond to see ya .. .  --  I do n't know a Miss Desmond . What 's she look like ?  --  Tee-hee . Like a zombie ; I 'd say . Face pale like flour.  --  Priscilla , you 're talking to your mistress . Show her in . And straighten your cap . Nothing would have done me more good than to go straight to Benediction . But last year I 'd turned away a girl with an illegitimate baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a grievous offense . This Mary Desmond was tall and thin , with a modest cloth coat and a shapeless felt hat . Yet she was feminine and very soft . Except for her pallor , she 'd have been beautiful in a rather horsy way . I arose slowly and stood by my chair without speaking , for after all I was in my own house . ( I learned my etiquette forty years ago from the Sisters of Saint Joseph , all of whom were addressed as Madam . ) The girl put out her hand , and I took it . She seemed , for all her spirituality , as feverish as a warm breeze :  --  Mrs Murray , you do n't know me , and I hope you do n't resent too much my barging in this way . . . . But I have been told ( and please , this is no attempt to cajole you ) that you 're one of the leading Catholic ladies of our city . . . . I knew she wished some favor , but I simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising my right hand a little . And though it was a sin of Pride , I was vaguely pleased.  --  I love the Church . When a woman grows older , it becomesher whole life , Miss Desmond ... . ( There was an eagerness and sparkle in this girl ; nothing cheap. )  --  It 's almost my life too , Mrs Murray . You see , I almost became a Carmelite nun ... . Feeling both pleased and disappointed , I begged her to sit down and have a cup of tea . I did n't press her , of course ; but as I was pouring , I said as gently as I could :  --  AImost , my dear ? There are no almosts with God ... . -O , please do n't misunderstand me , Mrs Murray ! It'sjust that I thought I 'd make a better singer than a nun.  --  Ah , you sing ? I said rather feebly , passing her one ofFather Rushton 's favorite tarts.  --  Yes . At Saint Stanislaus 's . Every Sunday at the eleven o'clock solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my cup clanged against my saucer . Saint Stanislaus 's in the West End ! How often had I waited in the shadow of the alley to see if my David went to Mass ! And when he lied to me , my heart broke for the dozenth time , for then I knew he 'd lost his faith.  --  Then you 're serving God with your voice , Miss Desmond . You should be proud ... . She drank her tea as though she were really thirsty , poor thing :  --  But I 'm not . I want to sing in a better church , Mrs Murray . I do n't think it 's decent to sing operatic tunes and waltzes at a Mass . I want to sing good liturgical music in a good church . . . .  --  My dear , I know full well that Europe is miles ahead of us in the revival of interest in the liturgy . I studied piano as a girl ; I agree with you . . . . But honestly , has n't the questionp209of money something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , permit me to question your motives in coming to visit me . . . . I could , of course , get you a job in a richer parish . But would n't you then be defaulting on your obligations to your own ? The girl leaned toward me ; I had to admit there was nothingshoddy or commercial in her intensity . Indeed I 'd never seen a young woman so dedicated :  --  I do need money badly , Mrs Murray . I do n't deny it . But I try to do my bit as a Catholic girl . Some organize sodalities ; some , bridge parties ; some wash altar cloths . I , well , I just want to sing for the glory of God ... .  --  But after all , Miss Desmond , you 're doing what you like to do . Not much sacrifice in that , is there ? Forty years ago the Sisters of Saint Joseph told me that Our Divine Lord bestows more graces on sacrifices that hurt us a little . Mary Desmond stood up slowly and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebel she was as a Carmelite novice . Her voice was steely and clear :  --  Mrs Murray , permit me to say that that is a Puritan idea . It has nothing to do with the generous and human spirit of Catholicism . . . . Am I supposed to lick the steps of a church with my tongue ? Go up Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupre on my bare knees ? I wondered whether I should terminate the interview immediately , and yet there was a rage in her I 'd read that great saints experience .. And in justice I decided that she knew our religion better than I.  --  I 'm not offended , Miss Desmond ... but perhaps you 'll sing something for me . . . . She drew herself up even straighter and glanced around the room at a harp-shaped spot in the rug where David 's piano used to stand ; the sunlight had there impressed the shadow , before David took the piano away . And I felt a pang as I told her :  |  --  I do n't have a piano anymore , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Something inexplicable crossed her face , but she sang for me , unaccompanied . I was reared in an era when Irish Catholicgirls used music as something decorative to catch a spouse . David ( who was as cutting to me as a son can be to a mother ) had often told me this . This Mary Desmond sang for me something in Latin . But I knew enough to recognize that it was a gorgeous voice . I even paid her the deference of not keeping time with my wedding ring finger , as I love to do when I listen to music . She was quite aware of her worth as a singer , but she waited for me to speak . I chose my words very carefully :  --  Miss Desmond , I 'm only an amateur in these matters . But I think I can safely promise you a job as soloist at the cathedral by the first Sunday of November . I was mistaken about the coolness underneath her fey fire , for that was all embers ; asking my permission , she kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kissed , but this was quite painless , more charming than my girl friends or the young nuns when I was boarding at the convent forty years ago.  --  I 'm quite fond of you , Miss Mary Desmond , I said , walking her to the door . She stepped out on the landing and took my hand :  --  And I 'm more than fond of you , Mrs Murray . Because , you see , I 've fallen in love with your son ... .  --  Come back , I called . We 've only begun to talk , it seems . . . .  --  Another time , she called back . And she was out of sight . I put a hand to my heart , which all this afternoon had been skipping . No more , no more ! I said to myself ; you must go and lie down . But a stout woman was climbing the stairs . In my agitation  |p211I  could n't at first place her , especially under that crazy vulgar plumed hat , fit for a charwoman on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd met her at David 's housewarmingat the beginning of the year . Isobel Joy 's mother . A feverish sickness began to close in upon me : no more , no more.  --  Mrs Murray , you 're probably no gladder to see me than I am to come here , said Mrs Joy , panting from the climb . ( I gave her credit for not presuming to step across my threshold uninvited . ) She continued :  --  But us mothers has Christian duties . Do n't matter much how we do em , as long as we do em ... . There was a flicker of something smoky in that huge body . I stepped back into my apartment and invited her in . And Priscilla just was n't there to relieve Isobel 's mother of her coat . I did it . That huge purple hat , as though she knew she was invited for tea ! She lumbered past me , with a smell of soap and cheap cologne.  --  We met only once , Mrs Murray . That 's right , ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God forgive me , I puked over his elegant bedspread , and I ai n't lived it down with my family yet . . . . But even that night I watchedya , Mrs Murray , and I knew ya was a lady . Ya son 's a gentleman too . . . of sorts .... I do n't know how I did it , but I took her arm and led her to the tea table , motioning to Priscilla to bring hot water for this third tea of the afternoon . Mrs Joy eased herself into a cane chair , looking desperate and hopeful , like a cancer patient . Her little eyes , sunk in their fat , went all over my pretty sun parlor.  --  We 'll have fresh tea in a moment , Mrs Joy.  --  You 're a real dearie , you are . . . . I see from the leavins ya been havin a taxi dance marathon tea party here . Well , some like their alcohol , and some like their tea . Am I right or wrong ?  |p212I  replied as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rudeness :  --  Well , you see , people have been in and out all afternoon ....  --  And you 're bushed , I can see that , dearie . I 'm sorry I had to come . . . . O , Mrs Murray , I always wanted a nice place to entertain my kids ' friends , but I never got it . At least I did put a juke box in the parlor for them , but they never would stay home . And are they elegant now ? ! Why neither Isobel nor Freddie would spit on our tenement house . . . . But you been lucky , dearie . You married well . You got pretty things , which every woman wants . Do n't think I did n't dream about them too in the parochial school ( that 's as far as I ever got with my learnin ! ) .... For the rest it 's been makin both ends meet , or almost , and prayin to Our Blessed Lady . Though sometimes I wonder if she hears my tired voice . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sopraner in Our Queen of the May sodality . And I was quite pretty when I married Mr Joy , a traffic officer , though you 'd never guess it today . But some women have it tougher than others , do n't they ? No reflections on you , Mrs Murray ... .  --  I think all women have it hard , Mrs Joy ... . ( For somehow I could n't quite frame her word tough . ) I poured her tea , and she took a huge sip between her sighing.  --  Does a body good , do n't it , dearie ? I wish I could inviteyainto my kitchen , Mrs Murray . Spick an span , if I do say so myself .... But I know whatya sayin to yaself . Ya sayin that this old sow ( meanin me ) , did n't come to talk to ya about the sorrows of motherhood . Am I right or am I wrong ?  --  You may say what you please in my house , Mrs Joy . . . .  --  Now is n't she the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I came to apologize . . . .  --  For what ?  --  Ain'tya heard that my boy Freddie beat the daylights  |p213outa  your son David and sent him to the hospital ? . . . Freddie'sbeen cryin his eyes out for two days . He wo n't go back to readin his gasmeters , an I think he 's gon na have nervous frustration . In the navy he was crazy about your son ... . I sat there clasping and unclasping in my hands a handkerchiefof Florentine lace to keep my rings from cutting the palms of my hands ; I saw my veins more resurgent than I ever had before.  --  If he was fond of David , why did he beat him ? Something porcine crept into Mrs Joy 's eyes over her tea-cup :  --  You know damn well why ... . And all my regrets and suspicions of this year gnashed at me ; I stood up and began to pace the sun parlor.  --  We Joys may be dirt , Isobel 's mother said heavily . But God help anyone who does us dirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you let us alone ? We 're not your kind ! .. .  --  Ah , dearie , you 're older than me , and yet you ai n't learned there 's many things mothers ca n't do . And the young people are the craziest . At least they keep each other warm at that age . But when one gets as old as you an me , dearie , it 's colder an meaner ... . I did n't remember much after that . We talked of children , of hope and promise , of riches and of poverty , of life itself , I imagine . There was a rhinoceros wisdom in her . She drank six cups of tea , then wiped her mouth with a frilly handkerchief , purchased , I suppose , for this visit . She cried . And when she left at twilight , I gave her five dollars  --  mostly because she had asked me for it.  --  My welts are gone , doctor.  --  Yes . But you looked like a waffle . Are n't you going to tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you , I fell on a picket fence . The young intern smiled , as though he rejoiced that there were secrets between us . He had interested himself in me since my admission to the hospital ; I noticed that his morning and afternoon visits to my bed got longer ; sometimes he even sat on it , looking over his shoulder for spying nurses and specialists.  --  You see , Mr Murray , I did n't want to be a surgeon . I wanted to be a musician . But my father just would n't have it . I had to choose between his business and some useful profession . And doctors in the U.S. can make money , so dad is happy . For two years now ( my residency begins next spring ) I have been working off my esthetic impulses on hysterectomiesor on drunken Negro motorcyclists who turn up smashed at midnight in Emergency Out-Patient . What fun !  --  Is that why you haunt me ? I asked , reaching for a cigarette , which he lit for me.  --  I was afraid you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing sinister in it ; it 's just that I can talk to you . I get bored with old men 's prostates and whining old ladies with broken hips . You do n't complain . And today everybody complains ; it 's the puling outcome of the welfare state . The idea of nobility , of patience , of individual responsibility just does n't exist any more . Everybody expects everything today , for nothing . They want flawless medical care ; then they kick you in the tail for doing your level best . If there 's anything more sly and abject than the poor people , it 's the invalids ... .  --  And I should whine , I said . I suppose I shall never play again as well as I used to . Or perhaps I 'll commit suicide when I leave here , and it will be your privilege to perform an autopsy on me . What shall I use , doctor ? Sleeping pills ? A razor ? A jump under the subway train ? Ca n't you see the headlines ? Mangled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( In the long hours when I was n't talking to the intern , I played with my right hand on the counterpane . No doubtp215about it , Fred 's rubber hose had mucked up the tendons of my third and fourth fingers ; they were no longer independent of each other , as Czerny and Plaidy had made them after twenty years of practice . But I could n't be sure of this silent clavier method until I got to a piano . My right hand did n't feel . And I thought of the ruin of Robert Schumann 's tendons . ) When my intern was n't there , the ward sickened me ; there were no private rooms to be had for love or money , though I 'd heard that my mother , unadmitted to my bedside , had stormed heaven and earth to have me transferred . The lesson , as she probably saw it , was that I should have gone to a Catholic hospital . And I lived within the hygienic routine , reveille at six , the thermometer in my mouth , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold bedpans , the self-pity , and the endless little intrigues cooked up betweendoctors , nurses , male orderlies , and supervisors . I thought that even a good hospital is like a foetus pickled in formaldehyde . When I was feeling better and allowed up for what were prissily called toilet privileges , ' I sent out for a metal reading stand , music paper , and ink to complete my sinfonia concertantefor large orchestra . What horrified me was that I could work better in a hospital than in the little house on Fruit Street Alley . Ah , to be sure , Isobel came daily , but she stayed only fifteen minutes the visit , saying that hospitals depressed her . The crowd came too : Meg , Louisa , Olivia , Tom , Dick , and Harry , with mournful or humorous little gifts and Get-Well-Quick cards ; they brought skulls for ashtrays , baskets of markeddownfruit , and Dick Dobbs brought a little coffin of bakelite , out of which popped a mummy when I pressed the button . I feared that Fred Joy might come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , to my relief . Isobel said her brother had hopped the rails for somewhere.  |p216The  morning I was to leave the hospital , there was something more than regret in the face of the intern , who was standing beside the writing stand , as I , with thick black notes and stylish hooks , was scoring the last pages of my sinfonia concertante . ( There was something too insistent in the handsomescrubbed boy , something as hungry and parched as a moth 's wing. )  --  I do n't understand how you do it without a piano , Mr Murray.  --  I hear it in my head , doctor , just as you can visualize my cervical vertebrae when you look at me . I got no blush from the mannequin of science , only an uneasy laugh . He hummed one of the instrumental parts at sight.  --  Does n't make sense to me , he muttered  --  That 's the first horn . And you 're singing it a fifth too high . . . . Try the fiddles . ( And I indicated the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stare of other patients , the doctor bent his black head over the ruled paper , and sang a rapid passage quite correctly , except that he did n't sound like sixteen violins :  --  My God , how strange !  --  Yes . I shall be compared to Bela Bartok . When the nurse brought my clothes , I got into them ; in two weeks I 'd lost some weight . The doctor was waiting by the glass doors of the ward ; with stethoscope and clipboard and white tunic , he seemed a rather Aesculapian monk . He seemed uncertain of whether to shake my wounded hand or not  --  another one of his reticences and delicacies :  --  May I call on you some evening , Mr Murray ? Maybe once a week I get a night off from this ratrace . Though I did n't take it in the time you were here . ( I all but blushed at this revelation ) :  |  --  Come when you like , doctor . And thanks for your care . The old codgers here have n't done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're old codgers , Mr Murray . You see , I was interested in what I was doing . . . . I wonder if the state will ever subsidize artists , the way they do labor , grafters , and the old folks ? I was feeling melancholy , yet I smiled ( after paying my bill ) as I came down the elevator into the reception hall , thronged with shawled old ladies and young blusterers who  --  damn it  --  were n't sick at all . And on a bench next to an old laborer with his toe in a plaster cast sat Miss Mary Desmond , smoking one of her rare cigarettes , and examining with care and compassion the admissions and discharges from this great roundhouse of glass brick , called a hospital . I walked over and took her hand in my right one ; I thought she felt how it had been mangled . She got up ; there was no concealing the morning pleasure of her face.  --  I did n't quite dare come up to your ward . It would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . . . . We stepped out into the sunlight and the welter of taxis and ambulances.  --  It 's no use your trying to go to work on me , I said ( intending to sound merely chaffing ) . No priest came to see me during my . . . confinement . I left orders that the cloth should have no access to me. . . .  --  What is really heinous is that you refused to see your mother . . . .  --  Why do n't you go back to Ireland and write mother songs for the late John McCormack ? They still sell well . . . . She turned and looked at me as I waved for a taxi :  --  That 's not David Murray speaking , and he knows it.  --  No . As the novelists say , I got a lot of thinking done in the hospital.  |  --  And have n't added one cubit to your stature , as the Bible says . . . . No , please , no taxi .. . We began to walk up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us was the subway , crossing the river over a bridge with upright watchtowers like salt shakers . Before us little grocery stores and cobblers ' dens and taverns , yawning open for their morning business . Mary Desmond took my arm :  --  Your mother has got me a job singing in the cathedral . I get fifty dollars a week . What with that and a few other windfalls from Mrs Monahan and Mrs Carmody , and the other First Irish Families of the town ( all thanks to your mother ) I am practically in the lap of luxury ... . I took the outside of the sidewalk ; my mother taught me this bit of courtliness when I was three . I felt rather gay ( and , as is often the case ) malicious . She was too preoccupied with me : - O , are you proposing marriage to me ? Are you speaking of your dowry ? Are you of county family ?  --  I would never marry you . You 're what the Carmelites called a bad man . '  --  Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You ca n't touch pitch and not be defiled . . . . But seriously , I had a suspicion in the hospital that you 'd make yourself known to my mother . You have your own brazenness ; Isobel has another brand . . . . It 's quite the nineteenth century thing to do , is n't it ? . . . Just as I would butter-up your mother if I had any intentions on you . Honorable , that is . . . She screwed up her pale face ever so delicately , uncertain whether to be amused or hurt . A car brushed too close to the curb , and the gibbering rabbit fur on its radio antenna brushed my hair.  --  Ticklish , are n't you ! I do n't like ticklish women . Means  |p219they  have n't matured . Now a French whore , for instance , would n't be ticklish . She 'd make me so ... .  --  David , you are n't being amusing . When you talk flippantlyyou just lower yourself to the glassy veneer of the crowd ... . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ?  --  I told you why that night at Pierre 's . I changed the cant of my briefcase full of music paper :  --  O , now look , Mary . I have an idea of what you and my mother are up to . . . . No matchmaking for me , please . You both know perfectly well that I 'm living in sin . I grant it 's unpleasant enough at times . But marriage ? My God , an indissoluble ( or nearly ) tie , so that some woman can spend her lifetime tilting at my weak points , which are painfully obvious after a half hour 's conversation ? No , thank you , my dear . I do n't want children or legal responsibilities . I just 1 . Ij want to be a good . . . out with the hellish and suspect term ... artist . She looked at me with pity , that pity I remember in the sisters ' school when I could n't rattle through my catechism :  --  David Murray , even for you to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an index of how far you 're on the wrong road ... . -O , for God 's sake , in another forty years you 'll be like my mother : a maxim for everything , with a hellish way of taking it out on your kids , by being so sweet and resigned about your sufferings ! She threw away her cigarette ; and into her low intense voice came all the resonance she normally used only as a singer :  --  You 're absolutely beastly ! And I used to think there was a sweetness in you ! But now you 've become like everybody else , without the corset of religion , fatly exploding into nasty meaninglessness ! . . . If you were one-tenth as goodp220as your mother , I 'd make a yearly pilgrimage to your shrine and kiss your feet ! I was surprised and took her arm again . Then I realized I 'd never really cared whether Isobel thought well of me  --  as how could she , since she had pawned her all for me , and I gave her only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isobel was around when I needed her , to cook my meals , to make love . And I saw now that Isobel and I had never had a conversation together , only love-words and insults . Was it that together we 'd destroyed each other 's sense of values and the ability to communicate ? But Mary Desmond 's approval was vital to my well-being ; I lived in the light or shadow of her favor or opprobrium , just as I 'd once courted praise from my mother , my teachers , my first toe-dippings into sexual love . She calmed down a little , but she went on :  --  Someone has to scold you , and often . Do you imagine that the artist is a god , immune from morals and society ? That was a filthy doctrine that came in with Luther and went out with Wagner . I 'll tell you what you 're becoming , David , and becoming fast . You 're becoming inhuman . A twentieth century disease . It stems from grimy cities , work at machines , decline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart can you get ? It 's so fashionable to speak today of mothers as causes of neuroses in their children . Mother in heaven ! Are we to rule out the million wise mothers with the other million foolish , and produce the human race by artificial insemination ? . . . That , I prophesy , will be a great day . Then everyone will be as bloodless , as flabby , as lacking in conscience , as so many present-day people that I might mention ! . . . I think it 's probably time we returned to the law of the Hebrews . Then , a froward ' child who lifted his hand against his parents or cursed them was put to death . Nowadays we 've undone all respect , all feeling for tradition and balance , by doing in the old folks.  | ... What happens to us when we get old and have ungratefulchildren ? .. . For something to say ( and we were close to my little house in Fruit Street Alley ) , I said :  --  You 're shouting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could shout it from the housetops ! I wish more people did more of the right kind of shouting ! They shout for movie stars and baseball players and brands of beer , but nobody shouts any more that we all should act as though we were created in the image of God ! How much farther are we going in this mass cruelty toward parents and teachers ? It 's got so today that any attempt at a truly Catholic life is jeered at as perversion and flabbiness ... . She paused for breath , and I reflected that , from some healthy atavism in our bones , a sententious remark , freshly and passionately expressed , somehow still moves us more than a surrealist novelty , which merely exercises our sense of boredom . Was it because , except in our perverse moments , drugged with sensual joy , or the seeking of it , we genuinely desired that all men should be brothers ? and none to hurt his fellow ? She had frightened me morally ; her voice went deeper and farther back than her mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hell : its infinite privation , its not-being in love , its eternal awareness of the loss of the beatific vision ... .  --  Why are you lecturing me so ? I know , or have once learned , all these things ... .  --  But you 've forgotten them , David . And I forget them too , sometimes . . . .  --  You 're hell-bent to save my soul , are n't you , Mary ?  --  Because I love you . And now I 'm going to commit a serious sin and call you a damned fool ... . I was utterly silent and forlorn , yet I took her hand :  --  Mary , I do n't know whether to say that I 'm sorry for you , or not ... .  |  --  Please do n't bother . Then I cast about within me . What harm was there in discussing with her what she already knew ?  --  You resent Isobel , do n't you ? Yet from that famous breakfast you knew what was going on ... .  --  I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all so . . . O , so wrong and wasteful . Certainly there 's a curse on it , even though you both do n't believe so now . I hesitated :  --  I do n't know whether or not I 'm being caddish in what I 'm going to say . I remember that in college I was shocked when my friends discussed the girls they 'd slept with . In those days I was still scrupulous about confession and Mass . And it seemed to me like staring straight into the sun to discuss with anyone external to the fact what happens when two lovers surrender their bodies to each other . . . . Today a dirty joke still embarrasses me , I see no point in it , even though , as you say , I 've fallen away from my spiritual heritage . . . . But I did love Isobel , if I am really capable of loving anyone . I suppose the reason was largely sensual , though when a man 's young , that question looms disproportionatelylarge . And when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have around the house . There was a sweetness about her , except when I 'd hurt her , or she 'd imagined I 'd hurt her . Then what used to be called her lower class breeding ' came out . She 'd become a hellion . Sometimes I 've even plotted poisoning her or strangling her . . . . And in the larger sense there is no true harmony between us , such as I 've looked for all my life . We have no common ground outside of bed . She hates the music I love ; she does n't care to read ; and when I 'm working , she fidgets or drinks . She has no resources of her own . Since she has never learned to work at anything , a lot of her energy simply fizzles away , or is taken out in momentary enthusiasms or piques . She 's still young enough to imagine that life isp223one long cocktail party , at which she is either hostess or guest of honor ; in fact , maybe even the liquor itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we spend an evening at home alone , she 's driven to distraction . She has to be amused , you see ... . Mary was smiling at me now , but looking at her fully , I saw she 'd been on the abyss of tears :  --  In reward for your sinister frankness , David Murray , let me confess that I belong to the minority of American virgins . I am supposed to be as cold as snow and as chaste as ice . I could n't put up with the oily double standard in Latin Catholic countries . . . . But my spinsterly heart tells me there are danger signals in the very diagnosis you 've just given me of your malady . Perfection is n't possible here below even in lawful wedlock , but just how long can such a relationship as you 've just described to me go on ? Certainly the tension will only be aggravated the longer you stay together . And those small dissonances grow ! On a piano they die away . But life is more like an organ ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three keys ciphered , and the congregation almost went out of their minds , as though they were hearing the awful vibrations of the Music of the Spheres ... . We were now by the little coffee shop near Saint Stanislaus 's , at the entrance of Fruit Street Alley . I asked her , feeling quite corny :  --  Will you take a second breakfast with me , Cassandra ?  --  No , my Troilus . I 'm going to confession for having called you a fool . There 's a First Friday here , and I can go after Mass.  --  Will you come to my house afterward ?  --  No . I have no intention of entering that house again , as you should know by now . But I had to let go one last barb before turning down our alley , where Mrs Gross , Mrs Kubelik , and old Carmela were  |p224|pounding  out rugs and belaboring one another 's nationalities :  --  Mary , I can see you forty years from now , at Mass every morning under a little veil , withered and palsied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattling through your arthritic fingers as you tell over all the joys you 've missed in this earthly life ... . But I had never heard such freezing rage , such lightning , and such controlled damnation as in her reply :  --  How would you rather see me ? Painted , syphilitic , and decrepit , mooching on every street corner , spitting from my ragged gums , and known by every cop on the beat as old Goody Desmond , the down-and-out bawd ? . . . Goodbye , David .. . I went down the alley , trying not to run from whatever it was behind me , as though she 'd sent the foul fiend to chase me . There was nothing in our mailbox , which must mean that Lady Isobel was in the castle , even though she 'd not deigned to rise from her bed to bring me from the hospital . I went slowly up the flights of stairs ; there was a smell of boiling spaghetti from Meg and Louisa 's . On my own landingI inserted my key in the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me with a kiss and love-words of the little language , as in the first days of our passion . No one . She was n't even in our gray bedroom , though the bed was rumpled , and our two pillows placed for double gratification of her own small head . There were bottles of wine and whisky missing from our stock ; she had n't stinted herself on parties while I was in the hospital . All our stock of china and crockery stood greasy in the sink ; the cockroaches had returned after their banishment . I went into my study and unlocked my piano , which some jester had painted with white enamel , to make it look like a nightclub piano . Trembling with rage , I sat downp225and tried my right hand : It was true ; something did n't go at all in the third and fourth fingers , a numbness like sleep in snow . I shut the lid again noiselessly and thoughtfully , but I was frightened , as when one hears a mortal prognosis . And in my absence the parlor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Draperies frosty with rectangles and circles rosy as an owl 's hungover eye . All around the room there were bandboxes from the modiste 's , newly deliveredcartons for dresses and furs . A pile of unopened bills on the coffee table . And giving a cry , I ran down toward the church , as one who seeks both mother and mistress.  |p229O  , the rest was my special brand of nightmare , though I 've always slept well , and David never understood why . It was probably that I possessed the philosophy of the grasshopper , the cat , and the lilies of the field . Consequently my dreams  --  and my nightmares  --  were all varying hues of gold . If I went to bed screaming , at least I never woke up that-a-way . And there was a logic in me ( which I know he observed , at least in the last days ) : everything that was to happen was predestinedin our first meeting that January night . Hence I think it would be well if the world returned to astrology , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the alchemists could have told us . And I have always been more of a believer in Osiris than in the Virgin Mary. 14r Kubelik told me , with his accustomed kindness , that the lease on the little house expired at the end of January , but that the rent was paid up till then :  --  Your husssbant is leaffink you , my dear ? -O , go on , you 've always known the score about us ... .  --  Vat a pity dere 's my vife ! I could strangle her for you , yes I could , but I vould end in de elecric chair . Ach , in Prague ve had no capital punishment , and ve could spend de rest of our lifes , you and me , loffink each udder up in chail. . . .  --  Get out of my house , jailbait . I 've got the lowdown on you and all the other foreigners who come to the states . You 're the worst sort ; the best Europeans stay in Europe , like captains going down with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Roosevelt and his Commie crowd made secret plans for admitting the lowest element of you , under the pretext of appealing to American sympathy for the underdog . Ha-ha !  --  But I am here , my liddle tear . I do n't even miss the girlsss of Prague . I am doink all right for myself . I am rich , effen though you look down on me , anudder tramp like yourself . Vat does my vife matter ? I haff fun in my off hours . You vould n't be nize to me , but I haff found many udders who are ... .  --  Meg and Louisa told me you 've reduced their rent ... .  --  Ah , a tollar or zo a month . Dey know I 'm tirty but dey like vat I'ff got to offer . No American men haff it any more . Maybe dey vunce had it , in de time of Jefferson , but dey lost sometink . Nowadays many American men prefer vun anudder , and dere vimmin haff driven em to it , maybe . Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no puns intended , pardon me ! Almost all castrated or Lesbian , but vat fun and vat money ! I felt it was wiser to kiss him on his goaty cheek :  --  Mr Kubelik , you 're going to let me have this apartment for another two or three months , are n't you ?  --  No , my pretty tear , I vill not . I liked you vunce , but you vould n't play ball . I knew vere you vere goink to ent . You are pretty , but you ai n't got brainsss like de girlsss of Prague , like many American girlsss who now vork in television , or as airline hostesses . Not much between de legs , all t'orn and spikes , but plenty up above under dere hair . You ai n't got dat , excuse me . You 'll be all vashed up at thirty.  --  But if you let me have the apartment a couple of months rent-free , you could come and visit me every day , and you know the walls are soundproof . You made them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vould haff been more fun ven wass  |p231your  husbant . And vat you got to offer me fading fast . And I do n't want your crumbs . My big steaks ant fresh fish I 'm getting elsewhere.  --  Mr Kubelik , you 're a monster ... .  --  Ve are all monsters , my liddle tear . But some of us monsters get exhibited in de best circuses . A flea , I grant you , do n't make much money , but a girl with big boobs shows herself on television and becomes a millionairess . As de Americans say , it all depents on which league you 're playink in .. . Mr Kubelik said a mouthful ; I had n't played my cards cagily . Around Christmas time , movers began arriving to cart away a little of this and a little of that of the precious things I 'd amassed . Really if I do say so myself they belonged to me , for it was my brain that had assembled them in our little house . And I knew that the movers were directed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other end of a telephone , across town . They took away the bed in which David and I had slept for most of a year ; they carted off his grand piano ( which Dick Dobbs had waggishly painted with white enamel one evening when I was tight last spring , a great coup of wit , which David had n't found at all amusing ) ; they lugged away the dining room set , which was the swankiest in the West End ; they robbed me of David 's Mozart records and his phonograph , though I managed to sneak out my poor albums of showtunes . The day before Christmas , when all was cold and smoky with snow , and everybody was full of that fake jollity which folks feign for the feast , I got a telephone call from the Bell Company that , due to non-payment of our bill , our French phone would be removed that very day . What a pity that Roy too had dropped me  --  another price to pay for my too much love and prosperity ! He 'd installed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be coming to disconnect it . So I sat me down in my housecoat and dialed the Jewishp232undertaker 's office . It was my last phone call from our little house , and I wanted to make it a gala one . I heard my mother 's voice at the other end :  --  Good morning ! Sam Goodman and son . Have you a sorrow in your home ?  --  Cut the act , Mom ; this is your daughter , wishing you a Merry Christmas ... .  --  And where and when shall we call for your loved one ? her voice went on . But I could imagine her double-take , for there was a click as though she 'd hung up on me . But I waited and the call was resumed ; she 'd picked up her phone before the dial system was agile enough to truncate us :  --  Isobel ? Where the devil are you ?  --  Merry Christmas again , darling . You know perfectly well where I am ... .  --  I ai n't sure I wan na talk to ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for lunch , Mom . There 's crabmeat on toast , and I might even manage to rassle up a bottle of wine ... . She seemed to be licking her lips at the other end , and she lowered her voice still more . Odd , these characters who get cozy and confidential on a phone in this age of wire-tapping !  --  You made it up with your gigolo , Isobel ?  --  Ha-ha . Just you come here for lunch , Mom , and we 'll have a real mother and daughter heart-to-heart talk ... . She gave a long asthmatic sigh , and hung up :  --  Sounds more like my girl , I declare . As I was emptying the last can of crabmeat to heat it and spread it on the toasted stale bread ( the last food there was in the house ) I heard a knock on the door , which I hesitated to open . But it was only Louisa , she too in a housecoat , and looking radiant :  --  Let bygones be bygones ! We know perfectly well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggnogs all the same  |p233this  evening . Ah , Christmas eve ! Is n't it delightful , this old world forgets to hate once a year ? Almost gives one hope , does n't it ? She attempted to stretch her neck inside the door , for she smelled the seafood hotting up , and I was famous for the dainty condiments I put into it.  --  Bachelor girl dinner , ducky ? Or is this an assignation that little old Louisa knows nothing about ?  --  I 'm expecting my mother for lunch.  --  Well , now that 's a new wrinkle in your propaganda ! Anyhow , see you this evening over eggnogs . Meg sends her love . She 's out cold with some vodka Dick Dobbs gave her for Xmas . Louisa retired rather gracefully after I 'd bribed her with the lickings of a teensy spoonful of my entree . As I was setting the coffee table for my last lunch in the little house , a young man came to tear out the phone ; and I saw , as I suspected , with regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been his double , for all telephone men , all dry goods delivery boys , all male nurses look alike , the new ministers of a new world . I wished I had a drink to give him , but there was only the bottle of chilling Chablis I was hoarding for my Mom . He disconnected the phone and picked up the cold black apparatus , brandishing it as though it was a gun :  --  Madam will regret this move , I believe . The telephone is absolutely essential to modern American life , and Madam will find herself completely cut off from the world of the twentieth century .. . My hands , one of which held a toasting fork , were akimbo on the flanks of my housecoat :  --  Would you be willing to pay my telephone bill for another month ?  --  Well , that requires forethought and hindthought . If Madam would condescend to sip a beer with me tonight at Keeney 's Tavern . . .  |  --  Unfortunately , dear sir , I am invited for eggnogs ... . Tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He speaks often of Madam . Muttersabout his broken heart . Apropos , does Madam know that Roy is married ? Not to the right girl , of course.  --  There are no right girls in this world.  --  But thinking makes it so , as the swan of Avon once said . The telephone man put away the dreadful little apparatus in a box , like a baby in its crib , leaving to me , as a signal of hope , the wires and the connections still in the den , taped up with wax . I said , in a sort of desperation :  --  Ask Roy why he never comes to see me. -O Madam , this life is full of infinite possibilities , but the impossibilities are even more infinite . One takes one 's choice of outrages ... . He was even profounder and more obscene than Roy . All people who work in electronics get to be that way . I returned to my simmering crabmeat , for which I 'd prepared a piquant sauce , the kind that David once declared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on my Mom . And as I opened the last can of onion soup and dumped it in the last clean pot , I heard Mom 's big feet and hoarse breathing outside my door on the landing . I opened and kissed her on the cheek ; she had on a new hat and was carrying a shopping reticule . To my surprise she kissed me on the mouth , with a heavy wet sound , announcing :  --  I been up to Meg and Louisa 's for a shot of vodka . After all , the vigil of Christmas , anything goes , do n't it ? Them girls ai n't half bad . All your old crowd was there ... .  --  You never liked them before ... . -O , my darlin daughter ! As one comes down the social scale , one learns not to be too fussy . . . .  --  What a charming hat !  --  It ai n't charming , but Mrs Murray bought it for me.  --  Mrs Murray ! ?  |  --  Yes , dearie . ' We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I helped her off with her galoshes , which were runny with the first filthy snow of the year . But she did n't miss a thing of what was lacking in the little house :  --  Movin , dearie ? Or bein moved ? Looks like a barn here . Your young gentleman up and leftya , did n't he ? Your father never left me : I had a ring on my finger , and did him in bit by bit . That 's the way it should be , my girl . . . certain insects have the right idea ... . I shrugged , seated her in the last chair left in the parlor by the movers , and went into the kitchen to serve up the onion soup . The coffee table , if I do say so myself , was daintily set with the last of our silver , and linen only slightly soiled.  --  I could do with another vodka , came my mother 's voice .  --  We considered it a liqueur too vulgar to have in our house.  --  Ho-ho ! Meanin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how nice can you get ? She lumbered restlessly into the kitchen . I saw that the gas was failing ; any moment now it too would be shut off , and this evening perhaps the electricity . My Mom took it all in :  --  Listen , Isobel , I lovcdya once , and I suppose I still loveya . Poundin a typewriter ai n't weakened my arm none , my lady . . . . Now I know a sobsister on the Daily News . All ya have to do is talk to her . Tell her ya story . It would make a sensation . Who knows ? Other papers would copy the story , and we could splash you and ya fancy pants young man all over the nation , with pictures , of course . This sobsister(she 's sleepin with my mocky undertaker ) would give us one grand to start with . We might even end up in Hollywood . Gosh , I 'd love to pose as a movie star 's mother or somethin , and be seen with my beauooootiful daughter on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . O , I readp236Winchell , my darlin daughter ! What made this country great was publicity . Not saying anything , I carried the onion soup , the croutons , and the grated cheese to the coffee table . I think I was experiencing for the second time in my life those scruples of finicky horror that David was forever talking about . My mother went on :  --  Rich Society Pianist Abandons Poor Beauty . I can see it on the front page now ... . I sat down beside her on the divan ; the lunch was too low for us :  --  God , Mom , you 're worse than I am . It was probably I who seduced him . But I can truthfully say I never blackmailedhim . .. . My mother lit into her soup with vast sucking sounds , like a sow . In what she called company ' she gave herself great airs with her napkin , dabbing at her mouth . But she had no time for etiquette now :  --  Shutya trap , Isobel . Which came first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crabmeat , stealing also from my plate , and making little moans of pleasure :  --  Dearie , there are only two things ya learned to do in this life . And one of them is knowin how to cook ... .  --  And the other I loved to do . . . with him . You see , I fell in love with him ... .  --  Only rich folks can afford to fall in love . I thought ya sucked in that simple truth with my milk . . . . The second gift ya have ( which might of landedya in Hollywood ) wo n't last very ' long . Instead it seesya , on Christmas eve , bein shoved out of a house ya lived in less than a year . Ya had five aces upya sleeve , and ya flushed all of em down the little girls ' toilet . . . . Now about this deal with the tabloids . . . I served her coffee , and with the brewing of it , the gas went out forever . I 'd learned a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper classes do , and the sunset of the gas in my range represented another sunset for me . It would have broken my heart to try the lights and to find that there was no more electricity . My mother wiped her mouth and picked her teeth , making a show of gentility by doing it behind her hand , unlike my father the policeman , who loved a toothpick better than a second dessert.  --  By the bye , I 've received a letter from your twin , Freddie , from Philadelphia. -O , rawlly ? He 's a murderer like all the rest of us Joys . And to think that David was so generous as not even to press charges against him ... .  --  He was defendin ya honor , dearie , like the old kings of Ulster . . . . Ya never realized how stupid ya great flame was . ... Listen , Isobel , Freddie 's got himself another job , readin gasmeters in Philly , and he plans to be home with his poor old Mom for Christmas eve ... .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her lunch and began to wander aimlessly , it seemed , about the wasted apartment . She began putting things into her reticule : the silver cigarette lighters Harry Korchinski had given us at our housewarming , little jiggers for cognac washed with solid gold inside ( just like a chalice ) other knickknacks of considerable value  --  and a whole coffee service of embossed silver.  --  But Mom ! You 're stealing David 's stuff.  --  Hush ya mouth . He stole the best thing you ever had , did n't he ? . . . Now come on home with me for Christmas and make peace with ya brother . I 'm poor , but I 've got a tree and a turkey . I took a deep breath :  --  Well , I suppose I 'll have to accept your gracious invitation . Because , you see , I 'm going to have a baby , and as a good grandmother to be , you must take care of me. . . .  |p238She  hissed like an elderly tabby , and I felt a blinding bash across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had stolen all the marmalade . I found myself lying on the rugless floor ( where Mr Kubelik had lain for me a year ago ) and staring stupidly up at my Mom ; I felt the blood running from my teeth . Almost immediately she was pulling me to my feet and flailing her reticule of loot :  --  There are bitches and bitches . But the worst of all is a generous bitch . . . . After ya have ya brat , I 'm gettin ya a job as second cook to Hizzonor the mayor. 2No , I had n't known my mother 's house so well since I was a child  --  the way kids prowl out every corner from cellar to attic , like newly acquired domesticating beasts . But it was n't anything like the little house that David and I had taken and furnished . I will say that it was immaculate ; my Mom kept it decent with ammonia and soap and elbow grease . It was what we poor would call decent or passable living quarters . Its whitewashed walls still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he was still alive and in his prime , and there were camouflaged dents in the dadoes , where Freddie and I had kicked our prison when we were little . But even then we had our own rooms and our own beds ; Mom had a horror of being called Shanty Irish . My Morn still slept all alone in a double bed in the cell to which she had been brought as a bride . It was a house I had n't been in much these last five years  --  only a sort of closet to hang my mink stole  --  if I had one . I remember my awakenings that January , really the secondJanuary of my life . Mom went to bed every evening at ten because she had to get up at seven to go to work at Mr Goodman 's Funeral Parlor . But I would sit up till two or three ( as in the days of my glory ) , smoking cigarettes and sipping from a gallon jug of cheap sauterne . O , I admitp239sometimes my hand would reach for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dick , or Harry , or even David at his mother 's house  --  yet I never did . Sometimes I 'd put a nickel in the juke box in our parlor , the volume very low , and play a showtune like Mary Martin singing My Funny Valentine , ' arising from my chair to sing and dance to the rhythm of it . Sometimes I took off all my clothes ( like for Roy , when he wanted to photograph me ) and swayed , the glass in my hand . My Mom was kinder to me than I 'd expected : she gave me money for sauterne and cigarettes , though she refused to buy me liquor . Close to dawn I 'd go to bed because there was nothing else to do . It was a job getting to sleep , that slow spiraling into annihilation when your head is swimming ; and I 'd move around grunting in my frigid little bed , more hurt than I can say to find no one else , a particular special one , beside me , to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've slept with someone for almost a year , it becomes as natural as eating , and you feel less than half yourself sleeping alone . But waking at seven in the morning , after a surface and spastic sleep , was even more frightful . I 'd light a cigarette , and all the accumulated mucus of the evening would boil in my stomach , and I 'd begin hacking . And such coughs ! They seemed to tear out my guts and my liver , and something else of me , which cradled something living , something of David 's  --  rocked in the vise of my spasms . That first cigarette of the morning for a heavy smoker like myself is pure Calvary ; they ought to make a documentary film of my torment and distribute it for projection to every local branch of the WCTU and the anti-nicotine ladies ' clubs . For I 'd cough and cough , with a cigarette like a baneful little torch in my mouth , and often with the racking ( which was like a sob of the body ) my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mom with a cup of coffee for me ( just like David used to do when I had him trained ) ; she blinking in her stained kimono , and her breath as she bent over me smelling like Dick Dobbs 's antique shop.  --  Drink this , dearie . Ya ought a quit smokin an drinkin . It 's bad for a girl when she 's got a roast in the oven ... . I 'd drink the coffee , which was strong and good  --  why is it only the poor and the Italians know how to make coffee ?  --  and some of my coughing and cigarette asthma would decrease , enough for me to light another . Then my Mom  --  she did it every dawn in a combination of rage , jealousy , and grandmaternal curiosity  --  would strip off my bed clothing and look at my belly :  --  And how 's my grandson doin ?  --  Aliver than me , I 'll bet ... . She loved to put her big fat hand there to feel its movement , her wedding ring against my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the intimacy that men think they know , but that only two women feel with each other , in spite of their clawing and gossip . My mother was proud of me , in spite of herself , in those days :  --  Isobel , this is the second or third compliment I ever paidya . Ya gon na be a darn good breeder , just like I was . I could get up and cook corned beef an cabbage for ya Pa three hours after the midwife got through with me ... . Then she went back to her own room , dressed for work , came back , and kissed me on the forehead :  --  Lovey , there 's always the telephone if ya need me . But do n't you get up before noon , if ya heed my advice . And if ya feel like it , shell those peas in the earthen crock in the kitchen before I get home from work tonight . . . .  --  You 're awfully good to me , Mom. -O , I 'm not such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got an elegant job lined up forya . Then you can pay me $1O a week for board and room for you and my grandson , and we 'll go on livin here like the crazy threesome we alwaysp241was . And we 'll go to the restaurant for ravioli every Saturday night , and after that , to a movie or a radio give-away show . If ya brat is cute , like you and his father , who knows he might win a beauty contest , and we 'd all end up in Hollywood , and he 'd be another Sabu ? .. . After she went out in the cold to her typewriter , I smoked another cigarette or two , and fell into a sweet warm nap . I had already resolved what I should do . Around noon I got up , washed , dressed , and shelled the peas . Then because I was feeling downright affectionate toward Mom , I put the potroast in the oven and basted it . Tonight it would be tender and juicy , and maybe Mom would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money I found on leaving David 's and my little house . Now that I had made my grand and tearing decision , I could afford two bottles of Old Granddad . It was a shiny January afternoon , precisely like that one , a year ago , when I left David 's mother 's house , convinced that a new winter , spring , and summer were dawning all about me . A year ago ! And me five years older , or ten , and carrying a fruit I never counted on bearing , because I 'd heard it ruins your looks . I thought of these things even as the peas podded through my fingers in my Mom 's kitchen , reminding me in their shape of something else , which was the cause of all my woe . I took the subway into town from East Boston , and got off at the station near Fruit Street Alley . Walking a little heavily , and ( I noticed ) leaning a trifle backward like an Alps climber , I passed by Mr Kubelik 's block of flats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , past the frozen fountain . Meg and Louisa were at work at their department stores . And the apartment beneath theirs  --  God , had I once lived there like a bride ?  --  had all its windows covered with Bon Ami paste for washing . So , no takers yet ? Perhaps prospective tenants , introduced by Carmen Sp242O'Brien , felt that my ex-little house was haunted . But I glimpsed Mrs Kubelik in her window , working on her bank account . And Massimo rushed out to greet me , in corduroy riding breeches , still not old enough to go to school :  --  Gim me moneys.  --  I 've got only a five-dollar bill.  --  Gim me five dollars . . . . I 'll buy tonic and hamburgers for both of us ... . I saw also the back of Mrs Gross , doing her housework and trying to watch television at the same time . Old Carmelacame out into the snow with a gift for me  --  pickles in vinegar and a hot roll . She was probably the last Sicilian immigrant to bake her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Carmela , take a tip from me . You should learn English . You ought to be ashamed of yourself after fifty years ... .  --  You make-a da keed ? You and your man ? Bene , bene.  --  Yes , I make-a . da keed . All by myself.  --  Bene , bene . Everybody in Girgenti make-a da keed . I shook her dry old Italian hand and walked away , always looking back on Fruit Street Alley ; I saw the head of CarmenS O'Brien bent over her desk , sound asleep when there was no chicken to kite . And I walked along under the El until I came to the pavilions of the General Hospital by the river . It was where my pop had died after being beaten up in Bowdoin Square by drunken sailors , and where David had spent several weeks after Freddie had all but killed him . From the receptionist , a pert Alabaman named Beverly , I gave the only name I knew in that streamlined establishment . The goodlooking young intern received me in his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathrooms . Even in my salad days I 'd have sensed I could never have made time with him : he was three times chillier than David . But he remembered me :  |  --  Ah , Miss Joy ! Welcome to our deep freeze ! Visiting another of your friends beaten up with a rubber hose ? I sat down opposite him and crossed my knees , even though I was trembling from something other than the cold :  --  Doctor , I am a divorcee once known as Mrs David O Murray . The fleetingest shadow crossed his face  --  it was a beautiful and ascetic face because he wanted to love , and , instead of becoming a priest , had made himself a surgeon.  --  To me and to the century you are one Miss Joy . And the surname is appropriate . . . . By the way , I came three times to call on Mr Murray , but the landlord told me you had both moved , and rather summarily at that . I was , to put it mildly , disappointed . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , canny one ! He offered me a grateful cigarette , since my Mom could n't possibly afford to keep me in the number of cork-tipped ones I smoked.  --  I should advise you , doctor , not to try to get in touch with Mr Murray . I , for example , have been too much in touch with hint Shall we say that he 's a fire that burns , and then extinguishes itself after having destroyed a whole forest of virgin fir and pine ? I 'd never heard myself give out with such rhetoric . The young doctor arose from his desk and paced his microscopic office.  --  Miss joy , it is not given to my type of mentality to understand such flights of phony poesy ... . -O , do n't you , doctor ? And I flung open my coat . He took one look , and a blush of tremendous regret , of which I did n't believe him capable , curtained his face . He sat down again ( really , handsome men can be so devastating-looking ! ) and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it that we never comprehend thatp244people we love , or once have loved , are capable of arousing that same passion in others ? )  --  I beg you to button your coat , Miss Joy.  --  Pardon me ! I had n't imagined that a doctor was ever embarrassed about such things ... .  --  I am literally stupefied , the young intern said . ( Then ham ; repeated what I 'd just thought . ) ' We never want to share , do we , Miss Joy ?  --  Listen , doctor , you must help me ... .  --  I know all too well to what sort of help you 're referring , Miss Joy . . . . I 'm sorry , I ca n't do it . I do n't even desire to do it . I am not a Catholic , but I have an almost religious feeling for the unborn child of that extraordinary young man . And besides I took an oath after medical school . Though I am already very cynical of my own chosen profession , still , within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nobilityto which I can achieve ... . I stood up , with something of the old flaming , swirling Isobel of a year ago : -O , you 're all alike ! You all talk in abstracts and highfalutinterms . But there 's nothing filthy that you wo n't do , when you come to it , if the candle burns low , on a velvet couch in the right circumstances . Confess , doctor , that you 're burning up with jealousy of me , Mister MD ... .  --  No . You just never should have existed , that 's all.  --  Will you do what I ask ? Who knows but what I might die ? Lots of girls have before me . At least it would be more antiseptic and according to Hoyle than at the hands of some filthy old woman.  --  Miss Joy , I beg you to go away . You 're not even temptingme . And he put his face in his hands . Who would have expected that this beautiful too clean automaton in a white tunic would have been capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least you 'd have his child.  |  --  Miss Joy , get out of this hospital , or I 'll have an orderly show you out. -O , what airs ! I 'll get someone else , I swear it . He did n't even look up at me from his laced fingers :  --  There 's always someone else . The world is wide . But not wide enough for you and me ... . I went out again into the winter sunlight , which was like the whip of his scorn . Yet I began to laugh as I looked at the Charles River , for I was dwelling on one word , incorruptibility . David had it and the intern had it ; and it meant merely that they lived in separate frigidaires , where no one would ever go for a snack or a cheese sandwich . There was nothing to be had from them . For if this world were full of incorruptibles , no one would speak to anyone else . And there 'd be no life , no fun , no anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for in life we live with worms  --  not in death , as is popularly supposed . Outside the hospital my coughing returned , and with it a dredging in my stomach I 'd noticed for the last month , as though Old Mother Nature were attempting to disgorge my insides , which were now entirely the nursery of my child and David 's . I went into a delicatessen , blocking my mouth with my hand against the upsurge of my breakfast ; I was all but running to get near the fountain of my heart 's desire , and I thought ( we think of little things when a crisis is rending us ) of Freddie 's saying as a kid :  --  when ya got ta go , ya got ta go ... . Gagging , I asked a pimply girl behind the cash register :  --  Poddon , where is the ladies ' room ?  --  Our rest room facilities are only for clients . . . .  --  Then for God 's sake make me a malted milk and a ham sandwich . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she waved me , and I was no sooner inside with the door bolted against pryers than I was assailed by that Niagara which had beenp246taunting me every morning for a month . I wished that David or my Mom were there to hold my forehead . The heaving and the dry retching , as though my own poor little soul was issuing forth ! In my straining , real tears issued forth , and through my throat everything poured in reverse , even to the last malicious drop of bile in my stomach . After vomiting I sat down on the only available seat and dried my eyes ; my hair was matted with sweat and my tongue tasted of alum . While washing my face I observed that my aim was n't as good as it once was in shooting galleries at Luna Park ; there was a mess to clean up like a sick cat 's , which I did as best I could with the paper wash towels  --  nothing like a crisp paper towel to make you feel at home . That word puke has more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I went out after fifteen minutes of recomposing my dignity , and consumed my sandwich and malted milk , wondering if they 'd stay down , though I 'd heard , through Tom Bernstein , of guests at Roman orgies tickling their throats that they might wolf down further courses and more Trinac -- rian wine , which strikes me as something like taking your pleasure in sex and not wanting to pay for the consequences . As I paid the check out of my five dollars , the cashier said , wrinkling her nose :  --  I 'll have you know that the management does n't approve of their facilities being used for such purposes . I ought to report you for disturbing the peace. =My dear , do n't think I 've been drinking , I said sassily , leaving no tip , as I would have at Pierre 's . I felt a little better , at least a little purged ; and I walked on to the office of the West End Realty Company . Carmen S O'Brien woke up from her doze and pretended to look around for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a year ago : -O , Mrs Murray , what an honor , upon my honor ! Mrp247Kubelik , and I might add my little self , were so hurt when you did n't renew your lease !  --  We are living on the Hill . In a more spacious and elegantapartment . Her lynx eyes narrowed :  --  O rawlly ? I had n't heard your name from any of the other agents , and I know them all , as business friends . Who is your agent now ?  --  Mr Murray 's mother is a woman of property . She has several houses. -O , how nice ! That keeps it all in the family , does n't it ? I always say you ca n't take it with you , but you almost can with real estate , which is like the Czar 's crown jewels ... . By the way , Mrs Murray ( she reached into a drawer of her desk ) , we have a teensy little bill for you , but you left no forwarding address , and Mr Kubelik , regrettably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I begged him not to , for the thing might have got into the papers . It seems , ha-ha , you owe him fifteen dollars for fumigating the apartment with DDT after you left . . . . I hate to say this to folks of quality such as you , but it appears , ha-ha , that the place was alive with cockroaches . But in these hard times fifteen dollars is fifteen dollars , now , is n't it ? I was feeling more than a little faint and dizzy after my session at the delicatessen :  --  My dear Mrs O'Brien , I beg you not to lose your lunch over fifteen dollars . My husband will drop by later and settle it ... .  --  Far be it from me ever to have had the slightest doubt of your financial probity , my dear ! And to what do I owe the honor of this little visit ? My secretary Mitzi is out to her usual two hour lunch , and we can have a woman-to-woman talk . I took a long breath , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a businesswoman , but also a mother . I need your help . I 'm in an awful jam ... . She toyed with her desk set and her two telephones :  --  It is n't the policy of this office to lend money , my dear.  --  I mean a real jam , I said , lowering my voice for her nonexistentsecretary . ( She 'd known from the moment I entered her closet of an office , but now she saw it was time to wise up. )  --  My dear , should I congratulate you ? Mercy ! What we gentlewomen call an interesting condition ' ! Well , well , well ! You want the address of the best obstetrician in town , do n't you , dear ? Why naturally ! My advice to you is , do it in style , and do n't stint yourself !  --  I do n't want that at all , Mrs O'Brien ... .  --  Perhaps an inexpensive hygienic midwife ? Some secondgenerationItalians prefer them ... .  --  Listen to me , Mrs O'Brien . A young artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too soon in their career , can they ? She arose abruptly and paced her office , tampering with her astrakhan hat :  --  My dear , I understand only too well . But I ca n't possibly do what you ask ... .  --  Even if my doctor says that childbirth may kill me ?  --  You and I are both Catholics , my dear.  --  Hold your tongue , Mrs O'Brien ! Was t Catholic what you and Mister Tom Bernstein were doing two years ago ? He tells me you could n't wait to close your office , and sometimes you did it on the desk , with the shades drawn , and an out-to-lunch sign hung on the door . . . . Mrs O'Brien , give me the address I want . Her face twitching , she sat down at her desk :  --  Olivia knows it too . . . . And if you croak ? There are police in this town !  |  --  I 'd never open my mouth ... . Without looking at me or at what she wrote , she tore a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; and passed it to me , staring frozenly out into the sunny snow.  --  And now I 'll thank you never to set foot in this office again.  --  I 'm surprised you did n't ask me ten percent . All was in order . When my mother was out slaving at Mr Goodman 's , I used her phone  --  she charged me fifteen cents for every call I made  --  to contact the name Carmen S had given me in her agony . All was in order . I was to be met by a receptionist , ' a Negro with a carnation in his buttonhole , on Huntington Avenue at 11:30 on Saturday evening . A fine color combination , I thought , and would he be any relation to Olivia ? But before this fabulous appointment , in a sense the last night of my life , I had a thing or two to do . I 'd never listened to the famous symphony orchestra of our city ; in fact I 'd never heard an orchestra , outside of records , play anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestra , pride of the dowagers and the emasculated students , was performing a sinfonia concertante for organ and orchestra by a young American composer . And since I was , once upon a time , Mrs David O Murray ( in wedlock or out of it , or what have you ) I felt obliged out of sheer family loyalty to attend the premeeeer , though the thought of sitting in Symphony Hall with the elite , I may say , filled me with what is known as trepidation . But the hall , as usual , was sold out in subscription to those old ladies who are the fixture and despair of our fair metropolis , and I did n't have the money for a ticket anyhow ( I was saving it for something else that Saturday night ) and I would n't dream of scroungingp250three dollars and eighty cents out of my Mom , who said you heard the only music worth hearing at High Mass in Saint Mother Cabrini 's . Yet eight o'clock of that Saturday evening in February found me in the snow outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies in ratty fur coats , to whom I would n't have told the time , even in my best days , for they were n't the sort who hung out elegantly in a bar , reading The New Yorker and sipping a green creme de menthe . They were ladies on furlough from the neighboring dance halls , who at eight of a Saturday evening were reasonablydisengaged and inclined toward a mercenary flirtation , since they were at their best after midnight . Certainly they were n't going to the concert , but they came to watch the rich enter , for in our city the patrons of the orchestra considerthemselves something out of little old Athens , Greece . Cadillacs began to draw up , and out stepped in mink , lorgnettes , and durable overshoes , the driedup little old ladies I 've just spoken of , all Protestant Yankees , the kind who run our city and our state , all clipping their coupons from the Old Colony Trust , all living in overheated apartments , almost all followers of Mary Baker Glover Eddy , all getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them wore hearing aids on their boozes . Their chauffeurs were Negro ( the final irony of the War between the States ) and they 'd known each other on the North Shore for a hundredyears . Shivering in the cold of my green coat , I listened to their greetings , each alike and each different , the shrill bark of elderly Pekinese disputing a place before the fire :  --  Bertha dear ! Hot chocolate and fudge cake at Schrafft 's after the music !  --  Yes , indeedy , Emma ! And how in heaven did you forget my two tables of canasta last Tuesday ? Well , they were the people David wrote his music for , but the life that was in me stirred inside my coat , and was n't  |p251kee|ping  me very warm . That life , that life . A few hours more , and it would n't beat any longer in slow pregnant music , and I 'd no longer feel that I was two or maybe three , and I 'd be liberated of a weight I never asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long cigarette holder at brilliant parties  --  and I could walk again without leaning backward on my heels , and a bittersweet feeling as though I were an oven of new bread a-baking . Between the arriving limousines and the taxis from Pierre 's , I saw faces that I knew too well , so well . My crowd never used to frequent symphony concerts because they were too reactionary , but tonight , by God , they were turning out ; they knew a composer on the program , just like being buddybuddywith Beethoven when he was a pimpled urchin . They drew up in Olivia 's car  --  she possessed a mere Buick  --  and do you know that she had a Negro chauffeur ; who 's picking the fleas off whom ? The crowd were all wearing berets to show that they were existentialist or something , and they certainly were n't in evening dress , except for Louisa , who figured that her Socialism could tolerate a touch of elegance . Lousia kissed me rather coldly , and she knew only too well that she had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Ducky , we 're going to hear living music at last ! Down with the classics !  --  And we know that you were the inspiration , said Harry Korchinski softly in my ear.  --  Ho-ho , Dick Dobbs said , and if any boogie-woogie gets snuck in . . .  --  You 're putting on weight , Meg said . It becomes you ... .  --  Izzy , Toni Bernstein said , kissing me contemptuously . My paper has given me a box . I 'm sorry there 's no room for you in it ... .  --  What do you think I am , a scrounger ? I 've got an orchestraseat . Compliments of the young maestro himself . . .  |p252Olivia  was dismissing her car and chauffeur , which were blacker than she was :  --  Honey , you 're a goddam liar . But if you care to come for domestic champagne and curried shrimp at my place after the concert .. . And they skipped in together , the six of them , arm in arm . The other ladies from the dance halls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not doin so good , honey ?  --  I 'm younger than any of you ! I could n't resist taunting back.  --  Ha-ha , dearie ! The proof of the pudding .. . The arrivals were thinning out now , and from the doors ajar I heard the orchestra on stage tuning , a milling like a hundred grasshoppers in rut . The late arrivals bore a sparklingbusy air in the February night , as though they 'd left groaning tables and were taking a cointreau of culture after dessert . I was about to turn away and walk in the snow until my appointment when a yellow taxi drew up , and out got three figures , all in evening dress . I pulled up my collar and sank into the shadows , even though something within me reared like a little colt , for it 's a wise child that knows its own father.  --  My lamb , said Mrs Murray to her son , I never knew you to be late to music before ... .  --  What do I care for Beethoven 's Fifth ? .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even when he loved me and loved me , and caused me to have what I must lose , for both our goods , this very night.  --  He 's at a higher altitude than he was even during the rehearsals , said Mary Desmond . O God , was n't it I who once used that same tone of possession , when I decreed the rules for our little house ? And was n't I too obeyed and kissed once , even as now I was obeying other rules outside the formulas they knew ? Yes , there wasp253that tone of proprietorship between all three of them , and I was the little match girl waiting in the cold . He saw me , I know , and turned his face away . Mary Desmond noticed nothing , as becomes a novice in a nunnery ; she was spiriting him into Symphony Hall , as a wife spurs on her husband to higher excelsiors , be he secretary of state , rising young lawyer , or arriving musician . But like all old women , who notice everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toad , Mrs Murray saw me , and was brazen enough in her triumph to shake my hand :  --  Our dear Miss Joy ! How nice to see you again ! A lot of water has passed under the bridge , has n't it ? Shall we see you at the intermission ? It 's a great night for all of us ... .  --  I 'm sitting with the proletariat in the gallery . One hears so much better there , and the public is more informed ... . Then they went in , and I was left in the snow with the sound of the trolleys , and even the naughty saucy ladies began to drift off to newer sights and other markets.  --  Come along with us , Barbara Frietchie , and stop flying your flag at half mast.  --  I 'm waiting for my young man.  --  Ha-ha ! That 's what we all say when we 're beginning to slip . Then on a last bet I went around to the stage door . All my life I 've dreamed of queening it at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fillip of fate . I might have been Dietrich or Mary Martin if I 'd played my cards right , and stayed away from longhairs . Oscar , the doorkeeper at Symphony Hall , was a cop when my dad was pounding his beat . Why had n't I thought of it previously , me , wanting to enter through the front door with the elegant Republicans ? Now Oscar was on the pension my Pop had n't lived to enjoy . He just could n't retire , loving to see instrumentalists do him homage as concierge , and great pianists and lady violoncellists in the flesh.  |  --  How 's ya mom , Isobel ? Been meanin to drop by and drink a cup of tea with her.  --  Alive and kicking . I 've gone back to live with her , Oscar .  --  That 's right . A pretty girl like you should live with her Mom until she treads the way to Gretna Green.  --  Look , Oscar , I want to hear the music tonight . Can I ? Please say I can ... . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage door I heard the knocking of Beethoven 's Fifth.  --  It 's against the rules , Isobel . But for you I 'd break them . And the old man , smelling of overalls and his rancid pipe , gave me a program and let me pass . I fumbled about backstage , with the music ever louder in gusts of rage . I had a horror of ending on the stage with the orchestra , all alone in my green coat and little hat , looking like the tenth , and pregnant , Muse . At last I found a flight of stairs leading to a catwalk , and I mounted them in the roaring darkness , with the music practically drowning me . And I had wanted to go on the stage and sing in a supperclub ! No one had ever told me  --  not even Tom Bernstein , with his second-string drama critic airs  --  what it 's like to be a backstage to a great illusion , all peeling tinsel and stinky canvas , and forever the taste of dust in the mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this altitude that I was n't going to make an entrance in the middle of the fiddling and bumping orchestra . I was looking out on the auditorium through a plate glass window , and the sound of the music had changed from a hundred throats to the tinny single one of a loudspeaker . I saw everyone in the hall , and the orchestra bowing away , as though they were on a television screen . And in front of me a pretty young man , another Roy of the thousands , twiddling at dials and following a score.  --  Young woman , this is a radio control room , not a powder closet . Kindly get out the way you came.  |  --  Please , ca n't I hear the music now that I 've barged in ? He distracted his eye from the oscillating needles on the dials to wink at me :  --  Only if you 'll tell me what you 're doing after the production.  --  I 'll tell you later if you 'll let me stay . For later I would n't be with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twilight sleep I might wake . I sat down in a metal chair next to him , and every so often when he was n't twiddling his instruments , he tried to put an arm around my waist , and I fought that hand delicately but insistently.  --  Nervous , honey ? The control window has black glass . One way . We can see them , but they ca n't see us if we choose to have a little clean fun . You could even take off your clothes if you like , and none of those three thousand out there would be any the wiser ... .  --  Later , later .. . I was already in a trance , I suppose , it seemed like a dream to hear the Beethoven Fifth mechanically reproduced , as from a disc , yet with the players so near to me . Nor did I realize the ultimates of music until the evening , the last of my old life . O , David had told me when we were happy about fate rapping on the door and V for Victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for the first time , and I was almost happy watching Dr Koussevitzky and the burnished gleam of the wood of the strings . I understood my David 's passion and his one great love , which was neither man nor woman , but a glorious arithmetic of sound in time and space . And he 'd said that no other art could touch it , because it was outside us human beings , and its exponents were cruel , cruel , cruel , and outside life itself . After the symphony the radio engineer wanted to play , but I stalled him off , and he offered me a cigarette and black coffee . While he stepped out of the booth for a moment , warning me not to touch anything , I read my program notes ,  |p256like  any great lady in the boxes , with her fan and poodle . After a character named Ludwig van Beethoven ( 1770-1827 ) I came to David O Murray ( 1922- ) . The parenthesis was n't even closed yet ! And then the program said starkly , not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in D-minor . The program notes , when they talked of David 's piece , were a howl . There were two pages on tonality and recapitulation and Neapolitan sixths , which I have always imagined were a new way of having sex . After informing myself , like the great old ladies , on the music I was shortly to hear , I looked out into the auditorium through the black glass and picked out all manner of interestingparticulars in the audience . Mrs Murray , fanning herself with her program , and gabbing in her removed prissy way with Miss Mary Desmond , whose eyes and cheeks were burninglike a tubercular 's . David 's seat was unoccupied  --  where was he ? had he gone looking for little me ? And in their box I articulated all the crowd : Louisa with her head in her hand , a pose she was fond of when she listened to serious music ' ; Meg toying slightly drunkenly with her binoculars , rented for the occasion ; Olivia delighted to be the only Negress in the audience  --  though when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bernstein making notes in the marginof his program , such as hot , " schnazzy , " corny , ' which he would later rehearse with the crowd at Olivia 's party , over drinks , hating everything . Harry Korchinski ( poor old dear ) look unhappy , as though he wished himself at the American Ballet Theater . And Dick Dobbs was just plain fast asleep . The radio engineer returned to his monitor cell ; the lights in his control panel lit up with reds and greens , like my Mom 's last Christmas tree ; the tuning of the orchestra came to us through the loudspeaker . He said , attempting to stroke my last pair of nylons :  --  I see that the next piece is by a young American composerof our very own town , fancy !  |  --  It 's what I came to hear , I said , tearing at the hair on his wrist . The murmur of the audience over the loudspeaker subsided , and the rustling of the strings over the one obsessed note of the oboe subsided . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out , leading David by the hand . The orchestra got to their feet , and so did some of the audience . I felt both proud and frightened . That Mary Desmond was standing and applauding like crazy , and Mrs Murray was pounding her hands like a washerwoman and poking at her new hat . But my crowd , in their box , were n't standing , though they were clapping and laughing . I wanted to claw them from my invisible vantage point . Then my David took his seat at the organ console , gracefully swinging the tails of his evening coat over the bench . Through the microphones filtered a ghastly velvety silence , with one or two coughs ; then old Dr Koussevitzky , who in public pretended to be a sweet weary old man , but was really a holy terror , I 'd heard , with the orchestra , smiled at my David , and brought down his baton . Then all my world and the little child within me seemed to explode in joy and terror . O yes , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what was once our little house , but I 'd never imagined how it would sound for large orchestra and organ . David had said once it was like Vivaldi in 1952 , with none of the meretriciousnessof Stravinsky . But it was all David , and a David such as I 'd never known , or maybe never troubled to know . The music spoke with his voice , but in a voice in which he 'd never spoken to me . My small experience told me it was beautiful music , strange music , very new music . It was my David , carried to a pitch of intensity I had n't bothered to seek in him  --  that I knew only when he was content within my arms . I think there was a lot of me in it too , what I had given and what I had n't given . There was the crystal cold of the snow when we walked in it thirteeen months ago , andp258there was the cruel rage of David , and the nibbly warmth of me in those rare occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first movement , allegro ma non troppo , I sensed through the microphones an uncanny tension from the audience , a gnawing silence ; and I saw the stares of three thousand eyes on that slim figure at the organ , which I had known so well , O , so well , but without white tie and tails . In the second movement , a largo for strings and organ , I began to hear murmurs , and old ladies began walking out to their Cadillacs . It was too stern for them.  --  Nothing like this since Le Sacre de Printemps , my young engineer muttered . During the allegro vivace , David 's mother and Miss Desmondclasped and unclasped their hands , which they were mutually holding . The sinfonia concertante ended in enormousnoise , over a braying from the organ . For almost a minute there was silence , like wolves , after nuzzling , preparing to tear one another to pieces ; then applause , boos , whistles , and tearing waves of laughter , like drunks deriding the world . When Dr Koussevitzky took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bow , my boy looked like a goodlookinglamb brought to the slaughter . From the waist he made a low bow , his long arms dangling down to his knees , still gripping the hand of the conductor . And at that moment a ripe tomato flew out of a box , ricocheted off David 's pale forehead , and messed up his white shirt with something like a bloodstain . The laughter and the booing came to me through the loudspeaker ; the musicians packed up their instruments and hastily quit the stage . I thought I was at a football stadium , not in Symphony Hall . So I fled from the radio control booth.  --  Hey , pretty , where are you going ? Wait a minute forthe commercial . This is broadcast by Breakfast Foods . . . .  --  I 'll wait for you outside on Huntington Avenue . . . . In that womblike dark ( I still heard the realer laughterp259from the wings ) I found my way , somehow , down to the stage door , and I gave Oscar a daughterish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupendous . It had real style.  --  Hey , Isobel , dear , where you goin ? Have a cuppa cawfee with me after I put the lights out ... .  --  I 'll wait for you on Huntington Avenue , Oscar ... . But I 'd wait for no one  --  my hour , my hour had struck . In the snow outside the taxis and the Cadillacs and the trolleys were loading up . The old ladies , arbiters of our taste , were still tittering over the new American music  --  not gustily , like European audiences David had described to me , but like old sows , who have lain on , or eaten their young , like the impotent old against the spermy new.  --  Poor , poor , poor David O Murray ! said a dowager in kolinsky to her side-kick.  --  Poor , poor , poor you ! I cried right in her face . ( For I was n't afraid any longer . ) They all went away , as anybody does from life or from a party ; shortly there were only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I alone on a Saturday evening in February , with Symphony Hall standing behind me like a huge ice chest . Under a street lamp I heard a whistle , and I saw an old buck with his collar turned up over a green scarf , like my coat ( what is the color of hope ? ) ; and , as though fanning himself , he kept opening and shutting his coat like an accordion , so that I could see the carnation in his buttonhole . He looked like Walt Disney 's idea of an old Negro.  --  I believe I have a date with you , mister.  --  Sister , let me tell you you have a date with eternity . Once I was a Seventh Day Adventist Baptist minister on Columbus Avenue , but my poor little brick church and my melodeon went into bankruptcy . These days people turn to the Church of Rome , or to nothing . Reading the Bible does n't satisfy this generation of vipers . . . . And so now Ip260have become a species of midwife . But my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job is to take me to Madam Yolanda 's ... .  --  In fifteen minutes Madam will be ready for your patronage . She has troublesome clients this evening . And you know what the law is ... .  --  My God , brother , the law ! I 've always lived outside it , so why should I be afraid of it now ? The law is for lawyers , cardsharks , and politicians . The little old Negro flagged a cab , graciously helping me in . He gave an address not far from the temple of Symphony Hall , and I nestled back on the cushions , like one who sleeps on a mattress before his execution . He seemed almost like my Pop , bringing me with candy and bribes to the dentist . I half expected him to hold my hand ; I was almost tempted to push my clammy one into his black one , which I knew would be pink on the underside.  --  Are you afraid , sister ?  --  Not at all , brother . I merely want to get the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While we were stopped at a traffic light , he took a little case out of his overcoat pocket . It might have contained the silver flute of the Boston Symphony Orchestra , but instead , life being what it is , it had a hypodermic needle and some little vials , dancing as stars , yet far more pointed.  --  I advise you to take it now , sister . Numbness , like ripeness , is all ... .  --  Thanks , butch , my vices are all minor . I 'll take it later , at Madam Yolanda 's . On Columbus Avenue the taxi driver stopped before a tenement , out of which rode the brass of hot New Orleans jazz , which is considered so chic ; there was a blinking mauve sign that read Madam Yolanda . ' In and out passed Negroesand their girls with brilliantined kinky tresses , andp261many whites who were slumming of a Saturday evening  --  better Harlem than watching television between antiseptic walls.  --  But you must be mistaken , driver . This is a dance hall.  --  All life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisest doctrine in the world after those of Jesus Christ , whom nobody heeds ... . My old guide helped me out ; I paid our driver , who refused a tip and winked at me :  --  Shall I pick the little lady up later ? This part of town 's dangerous on a Saturday night . Why didn'tya choose Chinatown ? Smells much less .. .  --  Ha-ha . I 've been picked up once too often . My little black father took my arm and led me up a staircase . The hot jazz got louder , and so did the screams of Saturday night ecstasy . On the landing at the entrance to Madam 's night club , a slim young Negro in an evening gown and a blond little Eva wig was offering a bottle of gin and a cold chicken sandwich to his lover , a smart Irish cop , who resembled my father. - O , Loretta , you must take some nourishment , said the boy.  --  Angela , there 's only one nourishment I need , the policemansaid. -O , get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later we 'll have a cup of hot chocolate , and I 'll make the whipped cream myself . Wo n't that be funnnn ? Assisted by my little ex-minister who did n't want me to see such sights , I checked my hat and coat with an elegant Negress who was perusing Ebony.  --  She wo n't be leaving tonight , Leora , said my guide . So you can store her wraps in the annex.  --  Only quality folks speak of wraps , said the dreamy Negress . We walked across the dance floor under a revolving ball  |p262of  light that cast specks of fleeing color on the locked dancers : black with black , and black with white , and other whites sitting at tables and drinking and gloating ; it was like the dance pavilions of the 20 's ( people were even jigging the Charleston ! ) ; yet I thought it had some relation to the salons of Meg and Louisa.  --  Locusts and wild honey , said my little Negro ( and I could n't understand why ) . We arrived at a baize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just like in Boris Karloff movies . It closed again behind us . We were in a majestically lighted office , all chrome and Swedish modern ( was it so that I wished to decorate our little house ? ) , and at a kidney desk of blond maple , pressing buttons and smiling , was seated a Negress even more arrogant and cultured than Olivia , surveying me through a pince-nez.  --  Are you the new ballerina from Stockholm ? said Madam Yolanda . Because my corps de ballet is goofing off on me . We need some cool Nordic talent in this boite de nuit .. .  --  Do n't let her intimidate you , whispered my little guide.  --  I was sent to you , madam , by our mutual friends CarmenS O'Brien and Olivia ... .  --  A lady of color , the last , but what a woman , what a woman ! What she has n't done for our burning problem ! Turned herself inside out , like a noble squid . Would you like a drink first , my dear ?  --  She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even refused the needle in the taxi . Madam Yolanda took my hand in her icy one ; her topazespressed on me :  --  Are we quite sure we want to go through with this , my dear ? I advise you not to , from the swelling bottom of my heart . It may make you nervous , hysterical even , for the rest of your life . . . .  --  I have always been hysterical , madam.  --  A real realist , said my little minister.  |  --  Of course you realize that we ca n't be liable for anything , my dear ? If , as the phrase goes , you should turn in your chips in our esteemed clinic , your pretty corpse might be found floating out by Minot 's Light ... .  --  Madam , I 've thought this all out for weeks ... . To the surprise of my nightmare she drew me into her arms ( Chanel Number 5 ) and kissed me on the forehead ; she also smelled of cinnamon , in a motherly , nursy way . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she also kissed away. - O , you 're a real lovey , you are . Perhaps after this you will do as I have done , and renounce the so-called stronger sex . I really wanted to call myself Madam Sappho , but I discovered there 's a chain of brothels on the Italian peninsula by that selfsame name . Disgusting . . . Come with me , my dear ; there 's nothing to sign , no formalities . You are putting two lives on the table ; you need only lie back and take it , as you have done ( alas ! ) too often in the past . Mournfully the little old Negro took my hand :  --  I leave you , sister . God grant we shall meet on the sunnier shore of Jordan . He went , and I was alone with Madam Yolanda , who was languidly caressing me , a little like him who had got me to this pass :  --  Is it asking too much , my dear , to request that you turn your pocketbook inside out ?  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me never to underwritea bill of goods before delivery ... .  --  My dear , you 're offending me and the clinic . We are not pickpockets . Hence we should hate to have to go through your effects . . . afterwards . . . . The glance she gave me , which I could n't return , was a lizard one , yet completely devoid of hatred , of anything , really . Perhaps it was curiosity and compassion , and something else of her own private world . So I piled on her desk all the greenbacks in my possession , all the various moneys I'dp264stolen from David in a year , and stored in vases in the little house  --  against a rainy day. - O , my dear , I 'm so sorry ! It 's really not enough to insure against the risks my charity clinic runs ... .  --  Well now , rawlly ! We 're not exactly at the Mayos ' in Rochester , are we ? A poor girl gets in trouble , as you say in your nice-nellie lingo , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have sworn that Madam Yolanda was a Mother Superior out of drag , so gently did she chide me , never letting go of my hand ) : -O , my dear , we do things that the Mayo Clinic ca n't do . We are here to help you , and in this world you must pay for help . The cost of milk and eggs is forever spiraling , and the cost of love is the dearest price God demands . In fact poets tell us that the price of love is incalculable . And you 'd have to pay much more dearly if we did n't minister to you . . . . But then you 're a friend of Olivia 's ... .  --  I 'll sing torch songs out there in your cabaret , if I ever live through this.  --  We 'd love to engage you for a week , my dear . You have in fact a je ne sais quoi of the music hall manner . Gracie Fields , a little less earthy . Come .. . And scooping up my dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thick door of cork and steel wool ; and from the fact that the hot jazz was smothered completely , I gathered it was soundproof . There was an odor of chloroform and sorrow , and for the first time in my life I was frightened :  --  One could be buried alive here.  --  You may say that again , my dear . Tell me , do you wish a ward or a private room ? I 'm confident that our dear sweet Olivia will make up the trifling difference.  --  Please show me the ward . . . . She opened another door , and out came an air colder than than February , laden with smells I could n't place , but seemedp265like the fetid stink from an abscessed tooth . I heard too a music unlike that from Madam 's night club  --  a chorus of sighing and weeping , and once in a while a groan . All the voices in that blackness were women's.  --  This is the snake pit , my dear . You do n't want that , after seeing Olivia de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in you ... . And finally in that instant of the anteroom to hell , I knew what I was doing , and all that I had been mulling over for a month was the essence of evil , far eviler than I had ever been , or would be . But that if I went through with my contemplatedact , I would be lost forever . O , I had been wrong and deluded , perhaps more than a little malicious ; but I had n't known what I was doing . Now I knew , and I saw it as clearly as a star ; and what was waiting within me to be born moved , and gave me the right . I knew at last the meaning of damnation , that final icy renunciation , which one repents forever.  --  No , madam , thank you . I want neither a ward nor a private room . Open the door and let me go home , that 's all I ask.  --  My dear , I have blundered fearfully , accepting you on face value ! You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all make mistakes . . . . Deborah ! She clapped her hands with a pretty gesture of distaste ; there appeared a huge Negress , dressed like a sociey dentist , with a smile as toothy and mammyish as Hattie McDaniel 's in the movies.  --  Deborah , show the guest to number five . There are fresh flowers in it . I picked them myself , during my meanderingsin the country . It was then that I began to scream , and I ran toward the soundproof door . Madam Yolanda disappeared into nowhere ; and while I was pounding and kicking at the portal , the huge Negress caught me about the waist and picked mep266up as though I was a mouse . Indeed I bit her and scratched her , but I never felt a vise more potent , or a demeanor more calm and soothing.  --  Honey , do n't hurt yourself . You ca n't hurt old Deborah . She 's the mammy of all African polar bears . And we do n't wan na crush your fruit , do we now ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a closet , with a naked light bulb glowing , and a vase of violets , and what looked like a small suitcase on a surgical table . More important , there was waiting another Negress , who assisted in stripping me and tying me to a table built for massages in the gyms of high school girls who play at basketball . The room was n't dirty , but it smelled of must and camphor , and of infinite pain and regret . But I knew that what I smelled was waiting for me , like a murderer at the threshold.  --  I want to be free , free , free ! You understand , you butch-ers ?  --  You 'll be free , honey . Freer than a newborn babe . Then Deborah opened the valise , and I saw the glinting of steel inside , like a hardware store lit up for Christmas ; and the older Negress began to croon Summertime , ' and a rubber mask descended on my chilly face while I was still fighting against the leather thongs that held me to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like an incubus of armpits and suffocation . The last thing I remember was the old Negress counting :  --  Eighteen , nineteen , twenty .. . and Deborah arriving at the strophe :  --  Fish are jumpin an the cotton is high . . . Then I fell away into nothing , and my bonds became light as cotton batting , and I heard myself laughing , chortling , rather , under the mask as the ether bore me off into the sickly sweetness of its kingdom of night  --  sweeter than candy , thanp267love , sweeter than the sweetest of little girls in the nursery rime : And she had a little curlRight in the middle of her foreheadWhen she was good , she was very very good .. . And yet I climbed back out of that abyss , and the chantingand laughter of the Negresses was gone ; everything was gone except me . I was lying ( unbound ) in the little bed in that selfsame closet ; the massage table and its straps were gone ; gone the little valise with the satin lining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violets in my drinking cup . I tried to sit up underneath the sheets , but I had n't the strength . Everything had been sapped out of me ; I was weaker than a child  --  O , that word ! So I sank back in bed and gazed at the nude light bulb , which vibrated in my eyeballs . I was also aware of a sound like after rain , a dripping . And the dripping had something to do with a loss in my own body , as though an issue of strength and womanliness had gone out of me forever . There was an infinite sense of loss , and a dull pain , as though some part of me had been retched away with tenacious coughing . But I felt lighter , amputated , and not too uncomfortable . I rapped on the wall ; nobody came . I was neither hungry nor thirsty ; I had no desire for anything ; there was only the sensation that my young and slight body had been turned inside out like a gauntlet , and been found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to think about . To reassuremyself , I repeated my name over and over again -- Isobel Joy , and sometimes , Mrs David O Murray  --  and I laughed and laughed , and little giggling cramps came . The Persian blinds were drawn : I did n't know what time of day it was , nor how long I 'd been here . Because , like a metronome , it was drip , drip , drip from me . I remember
