In jukeboxes across the big , muddy , thawing Alaskan tundra last week , a top pop was Alaska , the Forty-Ninth Star , sung by Anchorage Entertainer-Bartender Freddie Beardon on the new Igloo label ( made in Anchorage ) . And it came close to capturing the confidence and cockiness of Alaskans ( We have riches untold-there 's oil , fish and gold ) , hustling toward the greatest summer ever . Some northern high lights : <P> Land-office business in April was up almost 200% over April 1958 . <P> Tourism is ballooning , with the season scarcely at hand ; in 1959 's first four months , Alaskan clocked 3,419 vehicles and 8,418 people pouring through Tok <P> Junction on the Alaska Highway ; a year earlier , for the same period , the tally was 2,433 vehicles , 5,725 people . Hotels are . doing better than ever ; Anchorage 's Westward Hotel and Traveler 's Inn are booked through September . <P> Airline business between Seattle and Alaska is up 15% over last year , and Wien Alaska Airlines has collected more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest ever . <P> Most publicized new arrivals in Alaska are the " Fifty-Niners , " an eager motorcade of 37 pioneers who left Detroit last March to make their homes in the new state . Beset by breakdowns and inept leadership ( " Thirty minutes after we left Detroit we were lost , " says a newsman who accompanied the expedition ) , the group has since had tough going . But vivid reporting of the Fifty-Niners ' trials has deterred none of a second contingent from Michigan : some 550 men , women and children have registered at $25 a head , will set out in a 100-car train later this month .
