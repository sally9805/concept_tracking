I 'D Do IT AGAIN ( 372 pp. ) - James Michael Curley-Prentice-Hall ( $4.95 ) . <P> In The Last Hurrah , Author Edwin O'Connor 's thinly disguised 1956 novel-biography of Boston 's former perennial mayor , one of the bedside visitors says unctuously : " Knowing what he knows now , if he had it all to do over again , there 's not the slightest doubt but that he 'd do it all very , very differently . " Whereupon the dying politico opens a " challenging eye and croaks : " The hell I would ! " <P> In his autobiography , James Michael Curley , 82 , echoes his defiance . His own story is at once a better and a poorer book than O'Connor's-better because Curley 's self-portrait is more revealing , human and tragic ; poorer because , whatever else he may be , Curley is not a writer . His suit-caseful of anecdotes , memoranda , unchecked recollection and trivia was turned down by two publishers before Prentice-Hall hired Author John Henry Cutler , a Jack-of-all-writing , to bring some order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some lifetime ! James Curley was born in a Boston slum to immigrant Irish parents who worked their lives away in a desperate effort to stay even-his father as a day laborer , his mother as a scrub woman . Young James tried in vain to dent the world of business as a newsboy and a drugstore errand boy , earning $2.50 a week " for hours that were short , if you consider eternity . " <P> The Martyr . Politics , he quickly saw , was the only way to escape the treadmill of poverty . Tall , handsome , quick-witted and hardfisted , he had already learned the politician 's first rule , " Work harder than anybody else , " and he was an eager organizer of picnics , outings , minstrel shows and church suppers . Anyone who was sick or needy in Boston 's 17th ward could count on a comforting visit from " Sympathy Jim . " He had a big voice that ranged from a resonant roar to a tearful quaver . Over nearly 50 years Curley captured a series of local and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four times mayor of Boston , once governor of Massachusetts . <P> In all his campaigns , Curley liked to play the martyr . Whenever the " evil " forces that opposed him proved somnolent , Curley was ready to give them a helping hand . In campaigning for the governorship in 1924 , he was opposed by the Ku Klux Klan , and fiery crosses burned on hills when he spoke in rural areas . What his listeners did not know was that Curley 's henchmen put up and lit most of the crosses . He sent fake Protestant spokes men to campaign in Roman Catholic neighborhoods for an opponent , and fake Roman Catholic agitators to do the same in Protestant districts . <P> After he served one of two jail terms ( the first for taking a civil-service examination for someone else , the second for using the mails to defraud ) , Curley turned to advantage what would have ruined most other politicians . He planted hecklers in his audiences to bait him on his prison record , and that gave him a chance to tell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that civil-service exam only for the noble purpose of helping out an unlettered constituent .
