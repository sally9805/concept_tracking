How should a newspaper handle an irresponsible charge made by a public figure ? Most newspapers , clinging to the old-fashioned fetish of " objectivity , " print the charge as straight news , leave it to the reader to interpret . Even when the paper follows up its story with a denial from the person maligned , the denial seldom catches up with the charge . For this reason , more and more editors feel that the old rules for handling such stories are not good enough ( TIME , May 4 ) . <P> Last week , when Indiana 's Republican Senator William E. Jenner charged that Fair Dealers " shamefully " sent American troops to Korea where " they were supposed to be defeated " by the Communists ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , the pro-Eisenhower New York World-Telegram and Sun tried a different way of handling the story . The Telly thought Jenner 's charge was Page One news , but in a rare editorial note preceding the news story , it also warned its readers to beware : " We print the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator . It should be pointed out , however , that Sen. William E. Jenner offered no facts to substantiate his irresponsible charge . " <P> The Associated Press also thought it time to sound a " note of warning on political reporting . " Said A.P . in its weekly official Log : " Politics are rough and will get rougher before November-so we take this opportunity to warn against misuse of verbs and adjectives . Remember : There never was a verb better than ' said ' . . . We 've had phrases like ' stinging attack , ' ' stinging rebuke ' and the verb ' noted , ' which connotes truth . The prize of them all ( not A.P. ) was this lead : ' Canton , Ohio- Senator McCarthy disclosed today the Democratic Party was the " party of treason . " ' * Which re-emphasizes : There never was a verb better than ' said . ' " <P> <P> - In the New York Times . . The Times received a United Press story which said " McCarthy claimed , " and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Times 's deep " chagrin , " it was misread in the composing room , set as " disclosed , " and ran thus in subsequent editions .
