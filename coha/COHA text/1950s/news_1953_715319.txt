President Eisenhower signed Congressional joint resolution in- , I creasing the loan guarantee authority of the Federal Housing Administration for home improve- , merit purposes by $500,000,000 . The President 's action will have the effect of spilling out the backlog of 390,000 home improvement loans already anroved in banks throughout the country and waiting for the additional authority . Many thousands of additional applications are now expected by housing officials . The measure , unanimously passed by Congress Feb. 26 , increased from $1,250,000,000 to $1,750,000 , - 000 the ceiling on the F.H.A. 's authority to insure the loans . The President signed the bill without commeht , but a White House spokesman remarked that " this is one of the few programs of the Government that makes money . " ? - The resolution amends Title I of the National Housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have averaged $600 each , and the Government guarantees them . When the limit of the $1,250.000,000 authorization was reached last September , the F. H. A. was able to continue making a limited number of guarantees to the extent of the amortizations of loans , which then were running at the rate of $75,000,000 a month . Home owners are now paying back the loans at the rate of $100 , - 000.000 a month . Edgar C. , assistant to Walter L. Greene , F. H. A. Commissioner , said that loan applications were being approved by the banks at the rate of 2,000,000 a year , Since the Title I program was started in 1934 , 14,300,000 loans have been made . Mr. ' tosh computed that , at the average of 3.7 persons a family , more than 50,000,000 persons had been helped to maintain better homes by the program . The " father " of the program is now a member of the President 's staff . He is Roger Steffan , a onetime grocery clerk who retired as a vice president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the White House . The Prediction True In 1934 , Mr. Steffan told Congress that the Government would not lose money if it established the home improvement loan guarantee program . The law was passed , Mr. Steffan was persuaded to serve as director of modernization credit from July 1 , 1934 , tol Dec. 15 , 1934 , and he traveled around the country to popularize the program among financial institutions and home owners . Mr. Steffan 's prediction that the , program would not lose money , proved true . The banks get $5 per $100 loaned and out of this they pay three-quarters of 1 per cent , or 75 cents , to the F. H. A. A charge of $5 per $100 loaned figures out to an interest rate of 9.7 per cent . If a person borrowed $100 and paid it back in a lump sum a year later at a cost of $5 , the interest rate would be 5 per ' cent . But a borrower of $100 under the F. H. A. program re ceives $95 and immediately begins paying back on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the full $100 for a full year , and the effect is a percentage rate of 9.7 . The cost without F. H. A. insurance is $6 to $100 per $100 . Having started with $8,333,314 appropriated by Congress , the Title I program now has $27,002,343 of capital and earned reserve and has been paying all its administrative costs . Before July 1 it will give back the $8,333,314 to the Treasury . The President also signed a bill for the convenience of members of Congress . The members were limited to 150 minutes a month of long-distance telephone calls and 1,000 words of telegrams a month . If they did not use up their quota in one month they could not apply the unused portion to the succeeding months . This handicapped the Senators and Representatives , who are busiest in the opening month . The bill ended the monthly limit but long-distance retained the annual limit of 1,800 telephone minutes and 12,000 telegram words .
