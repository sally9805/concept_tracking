Before dozing off for a final nap a few hours before the big race one day last week , British Miler Derek Ibbotson had a happy premonition . " It 's going to be interesting tonight , " he predicted . " I think the time will be 3 : 50-something . " <P> Like Ibbotson , the crowd of 30,000 that jammed London 's White City Stadium expected great things in the International Invitation Mile , an added attraction of a London v. New York Track and Field Meet . The entries included three of the world 's best middle-distance runners : Czechoslovakia 's Stanislav Jungwirth , who had just set a world record for the 1,500 meters ( 3:38.1 ) ; Ireland 's Ron Delany , the 1,500-meter Olympic champ ; and , of course . Ibbotson. the 25-year-old electrical engineer from Yorkshire , who twice had broken four minutes . <P> At the gun , Britain 's pace-setting Mike Blagrove led the field into the first lap on the dead sprint . In third place was Ibbotson , his chest stuck out like a bantam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , running like a mechanical toy . The time for the first quarter-mile : 0:55.3 , just 9.5 sec. slower than the world record . " When I heard that time , " said Ibbotson later , " I felt sick . " At the half-mile mark . the time was a phenomenal 1:55.8 . Then Blagrove faded . When the bell clanged at the start of the final quarter-mile lap , the watches clicked at 3:00.0 . <P> Ibbotson opened up . For one wavering second , he hung by Front Runner Jungwirth 's shoulder before blasting by the slim , blond Czech . Back in the pack , Delany frantically started a last-lap kick that started the crowd bellowing with delight . Delany sailed toward the front , but Ibbotson streaked across the line 10 yds. in the lead . His time : 3:57.2 , smashing the old 3:58 world record set by Australia 's John Landy in 1954 . In the first four-man finish under four minutes , Delany was clocked at 3:58.8 , Jungwirth at 3:59.1 and England 's Ken Wood in <P> 3:59.3 . <P> Victor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of milk , said the race had gone according to plan . " I wanted a fast time because that 's the only way to beat Delany , since he 's a fast finisher . " Gasped Delany : " A fabulous race . I shall dream about it for years . "
