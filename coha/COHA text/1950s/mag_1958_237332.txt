From a tense week of legal march and countermarch , political charge and countercharge , the U.S. emerged one big step behind its starting point . Plain for the world to see and ponder was the sorry possibility that Little Rock 's Central High School , integrated last year in a costly , painful victory for law and morality , might reopen next week lily-white . <P> " The Time Has Not Come . " The week 's legal maneuvering began in St. Louis , where the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals by a 6-to-1 vote ringingly struck down Arkansas District Judge Harry J. Lemley 's decision postponing integration in Little Rock until early 1961 ( TIME , June 30 ) . Arkansan Lemley had based his cooling-off decision on the truism that " popular opposition to integration " had led to " serious violence " in Little Rock . <P> But the essential issue , said the appellate court 's majority opinion , written by Judge Marion C. Matthes , was " whether overt public resistance , including mob protest , constitutes sufficient cause to nullify an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Circuit Court gave a stern answer : " The time has not yet come in these United States when an order of a federal court must be whittled away , watered down or shamefully withdrawn in the face of violent and unlawful acts of individual citizens . " <P> Yet just three days after rendering its decision , the St. Louis court brought a temporary legal stalemate by granting to Little Rock 's harried school board a 30-day stay in executing the court 's integration order so that it could be appealed to the Supreme Court of the U.S. In a hurried move to settle the matter before Arkansas ' schools open , the Supreme Court scheduled one of its rare special sessions for Thursday of this week . <P> " Most Serious Problem . " The political battle was stalemated , too . At his press conference last week , President Eisenhower made it clear that , if necessary , he would again send troops to Little Rock to squelch violent defiance of federal court orders . Each state , he said , is duty bound to keep mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined by a court decree . . . My feelings are exactly as they were a year ago . " At the same time , the President again declined to bring the moral influence of his office to bear on the integration issue . In a remarkable self-evaluation of his influence , he said that he would not want to " weaken public opinion " by expressing his personal views on desegregation . <P> Arkansas ' Governor Orval Faubus , just nominated ( and thus elected ) for his third term , had no such qualms . " Compliance , " sneered Faubus , " can not be obtained by invoking the sacred name of the Constitution , or by the use of the once-magic name of Eisenhower . " At week 's end he called a special session of the Arkansas legislature , asked it to pass a new set of anti-integration laws-in Southern anticipation of a final Supreme Court order to reintegrate Central High .
