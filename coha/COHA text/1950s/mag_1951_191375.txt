After a day and a half of closed-door sessions , House and Senate conferees last week agreed on an excess profits tax bill intended to produce $3.3 billion in revenue-slightly more than either the House or Senate separately had approved . The bill was quickly passed by the Senate , will probably be passed by the House and sent to the President within a few days . Major provisions : <P> An increase in the regular corporation rate from 45% to 47% . <P> A tax of 77% on excess profits computed either on a company 's capital investment or average profits in its three best years between 1946-49 . Most companies will probably choose the profit base , and pay 77% on everything over 85% of average profits in the three years . <P> Total taxes were limited to 62% of a corporation 's total earnings . <P> The excess profits tax will be retroactive to July 1 , 1950 , but the higher surtax rate will apply only to taxable years beginning after June 30 , 1950 . Since 75% of all corporations figure their taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the 47% surtax rate until after Jan. 1 . <P> In some ways , the new tax will be more painful than the 95% excess profits tax of World War II , since the regular tax rate then was only 40% . But in other ways , the new bill is more lenient . For growing companies and such industries as television and aircraft-whose 1946-49 profit base is low-there are special allowances to lessen the tax bite .
