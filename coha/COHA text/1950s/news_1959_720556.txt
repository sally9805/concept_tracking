txt Mayor Wagner yesterday ' barred Louis I. Pokrass , former business associate of Frank Costello and other racketeers in a television company , from taking any part in the proposed midHarlem slum redevelopment . This was the second time in two days that the Mayor had exercised personal responsibility for administration of the city 's vast Title I program . On Wednesday he had ordered the Committee on Slum Clearance , of which Robert Moses is chairman , to blacklist from all future work Melvin E. Kessler , an architect who had been an investor in the defunct Manhattantown project . In putting Mr. Pokrass on the blacklist , the Mayor negated the action of the Slum Clearance Committee , which had designated a group headed by Mr. Pokrass as sponsors in 1957 . The mid-Harlem project is dormant because no Federal money is now available . Mayor Ruled in 1957 In blacklisting Mr. Kessler , the Mayor had reversed the policy of ? the committee , which had continued to permit S. J. Kessler &; Sons , of which Melvin Kessler is a member , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Mayor had said two years ago that no one connected with Manhattantown should receive Title I work again . William Lebwohl , Slum Clearance director , said yesterday he had been unaware of the Mayor 's 1957 statement . Mr. Moses expressed doubt of the Mayor 's power to keep the Kessler concern out of Title I work . " I know of no legal power to direct the sponsors of projects not to employ the Kessler company , " Mr. Moses said in a statement . Architect on City List The Slum Clearance chairman said that he did not know Melvin Kessler personally and had never recommended him to a sponsor , but that he understood him to be " a reputable practitioner on the approved city list for design and- inspection . " Mayor Wagner discussed they Pokrass case over the telephone with Thomas J. Shanahan , vice chairman of the Slum Clearance Committee . He questioned him about a memorandum found in the committee files that showed that on Feb. 20 , 1957 , Mr. Shanahan had information about " a delicate situation " involving Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night , the Mayor said that Mr. Shanahan had told him he " did not know Mr. Pokrass . " It was learned that Deputy Mayor Paul T. O'Keefe had obtained the files of the committee , including the Shanahan memo , // and would study them for the Mayor . The Mayor said Mr. Shanahan had told him there was nothing secret about the memo . Mr. Shanahan , who is president of the Federation Bank ' and Trust Company , told the Mayor that his bank had made loans to construction concerns , including those that work on Title I projects . Mr. Shanahan also told him that " to think anybody could buy me by deposits " was " unthinkable , " Mr. Wagner said . When it was disclosed on Wednesday that racketeers , including Costello , had been associated with Mr. Pokrass in the Consolidated Television Company , the Mayor said he was " dissatisfied " that the Slum Clearance Committee had made no check on Mr. Pokrass ' background before designating him in March , 1957. for sponsorship of the Harlem project . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unaware of anything unsavory in Mr. Pokrass ' background . Disclosures by Rivals However , Charles Buchanan , who headed a rival group that sought sponsorship of the project , disclosed that he and his associates had been directed by the Slum Clearance Committee in January , 1957 , to try to work out a partnership with the Pokrass syndicate for the project sponsorship . A check of the committee 's records showed that Mr. Shanahan , in a memorandum dated Feb. 20 , 1957 , reported a meeting that had been held by representatives of the rival groups and that the Buchanan group had rejected a partnership because of " a delicate situation " involving Mr. Pokrass ' back-ground Asked about this memorandum of Mr. Shanahan as he was leaving City Hall for lunch , the Mayor said he would call on Mr. Shanahan for an explanation . " I want to get the confidential memo , " the Mayor said . " There is no question that a person like this Mr. Pokrass should be a sponsor . He will not be a sponsor . " As for Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a little more intelligently when , I see the memo . " " You 've got to give a person who is accused of something a chance to answer , " the Mayor added . Mr. Moses , in his statement about Mr. Kessler , said " the amount of Title I work he has done has been grossly exaggerated . " " For example , " he went on , " nearly a dozen architects are connected with the Performing Arts Center at Lincoln Square . We have no control over their selection and want none . " As to architects taking stock or other interest as distin- ' guished from straight percentage or other fees in buildings they design  --  this is common practice today . It results in net ' savings to them. , The biggest firms do it . " Whether this represents the best professional practice is a matter which I am not competent to discuss , and certainly not the critics of Title I who do n't even know the practice exists . " Mr. Moses in a letter to the Mayor said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervision of the committee 's architects , as follows : West Park , $13,000 ; New York University-Bellevue , $13,000 , and Lincoln Square , $11,000 . The chairman said that Mr. Kessler also had subcontract work on other housing plans ' as follows : Battery Park , $7,000 ; Gramercy Park , $8,500 ; Riverside-Amsterdam , $10,000 . Stock Holdings Cited " So fa as we know , " Mr. Moses said in the letter , " no one in the Kessler firm has any owner or stock interest in any of the projects on which they are working , except that at West Park one of the Kesslers had a small stock interest and was a member of the board of directors . " Representative John V. Lindsay , New York Republican , said that the disclosure that the Pokrass group had been favored by the committee- for the Harlem Project despite Mr. Pokrass ' background increased the necessity for a Congressional investigation of the Title I I program and its administration here . In Washington , four Republican Congressmen joined in a call for an investigation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , William B. Widnall of New Jersey , Perkins Bass of New Hampshire and Edward Derwinski of Illinois . All are members of the housing subcommittee of the House Banking and Currency Committee . In a joint statement , they said that the charges of windfalls and conflicts of interest in New York " are of such serious nature as to make imperative an immediate investigation . " They added that " there is no place in , the program for dealing with pals or shady - lane characters on a shady basis . '
