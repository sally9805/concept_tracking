The Kentucky court of appeals last week handed down a decision that was enough to give pause to used-car dealers . The court ruled , in effect , that a used-car dealer must tell his customer about defects in a car that " make it a menace to the public , " or else be liable for any damage the car may cause . <P> The case involved Gaidry Motors , of Lexington , which sold a used car to William Hensley . He drove it 14 blocks , and as he stepped on the brakes approaching an intersection , the brakes grabbed and locked . The car skidded wildly into a curb and struck a pedestrian , Albert Brannon , crushing his left leg . He sued Gaidry Motors . <P> A leak in the grease cell of a rear wheel had caused the brakes to lock , the court said , and Gaidry Motors knew about the leak , because the man who sold them the car told them about it . Thus , Gaidry Motors should have warned Hensley . In awarding $11,489.95 to Brannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a better position . . . than his average customer to discover what defects might exist in any particular car ... It is not too harsh a rule to require these dealers to use reasonable care in inspecting used cars before resale to discover these defects . "
