txt - - The . real argument- inside the government In.Washington over suspension of H-bomb testing is very different from the public political argument between Adlai E. Stevenson and President Eisenhower . In the political arena the debate revolves around two points : One is the humanitarian question of the degree of genetic danger from continued testing . Mr. Stevenson says the danger is real even now . President Eisenhower says it still is negligible . The other question is that of detection . Mr. Stevenson says the United States can detect any large explosion set off by the Soviets . President Eisenhower and the government white paper say this is not necessarily so . A A A Backstage in Washington the argument is on cold , hard , practical military considerations . Those who favor seeking a ban , or a moratorium , on large-scale tests ( by agreement with other possessors of H-bombs ) base their position on the following line of argu-ment : The United States has set off many more H-bombs than the Soviet Union . The numbers were not made public in the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . However , the relative numbers are usually referred to as 21 to 3 . Thus the United States has a long lead over the Soviets in knowledge obtained from tests to date . This advantage will ' be a diminishing quaatity as the Soviets increase the number Of . their tests and the variety of weapons they set off in their tests . If there is no ban or freeze , the time will come when the present United States lead in knowledge will be very , much narrowed . Therefore , it is argued , ' it would be to the military advantage of the United States to freeze the testing while this country is ahead . But this line of argument runs up against an obstacle . While the United States haF tested about all the big , super H-bombs it is interested in , it has just begun the development of the small types which would be used in intercontinental ballistics missiles . No one seriously proposes to end the testing of the smaller weapons until the . time has been reached when suitable warheads for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been reached . So there is more or less agreement that it would be militarily desirable to get a freeze on testing the big weapons  --  provided the freeze did not interfere with testing the little ones . But here comes the crux of the difficulty . Where is the line to be drawn between permissible and banned tests ? In theory you could just arbitrarily say no more tests of H-bombs with a destructive capacity beyond a quarter megaton . But detection devices are not sufficiently accurate or reliable to determine whether a Soviet explosion exceeded a quarter megaton . The Kremlin might agree to the quarter-megaton limit , , set off a half megaton , and then claim that , it was only a qaurter ? , ancithe United.States could n't be sure the , poviets were ' telling the truth : If the means of detection could be improved and if the experts could decide on the line between those sizes no longer needing further experimentation , the government would ' probably be able to come to agreement within itself on ' a formula for a freeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time being , the existence of the public political argument has frozen the technical argument behind the scenes . Once Mr. Stevenson proposed the ban on large H-bombs , the government strategists who favored a limited ireeze realized that further discussion and consideration would have to wait until after the elections . But this does not mean that the idea of a limited freeze has been abandoned permanently . There is a strong argument for a limited freeze which would give the United States the advantage . The trouble is that no one has yet been able to work out a formula which satisfies the many and conflicting interests in the various branches of the Defense Department and Atomic Energy Coinmission . But the possibility exists of seizing on the many Soviet protestations of desire for an H-bomb freeze to obtain the carefully f tailored type of freeze which would leave the United States with more of its existing lead than would be possible if the tests should go on indefinitely .                    @
