The building boom since World War II has raised its own kind of scar on the U.S. landscape : the freshly bulldozed plain overgrown with contractors ' shacks and self-conscious new homes , but bare of almost all its original vegetation . Only a few trees escape the bulldozers of the new " development " architects , and they are usually covered with handy red signs reading : " This way to the model home . " <P> Conservation experts and tree lovers have looked on grimly , but generally in silence . But last week , after a lady in St. Louis complained about the loss of 100 bulldozed elms near her property , Fred Meyer , tree expert of the Missouri Botanical Garden , let out a long-overdue squawk to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch . <P> " This incident has brought to a head the ire I feel every time I drive by one of these new ' scorched-earth ' housing projects , " he wrote . " This bulldozing practice often involves several acres of beautiful and otherwise very valuable woodland which the prospective home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home surroundings . Once their job is completed , the contractors and their gangs quickly disperse to some other desert-making campaign . But what about the poor homeowners-the people who are going to live in those houses ? The best they can do is to plant sapling elms and maples and wait 20 years . " <P> After his letter appeared , Dendrologist Meyer got an encouraging response from people who sympathized with his protest . Concurred the Post-Dispatch : " A house built on a sun-baked scar looks uncomfortably hot in summer and barren and uncared-for at any season . Many times , its builder has destroyed what is of far more value than what has been created . "
