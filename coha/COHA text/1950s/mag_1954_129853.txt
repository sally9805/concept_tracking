The woods are fun ... Our country 's extensive woodland areas have always been a source of pleasure for millions of Americans . Roughly half of our population takes to the woods some time each year to enjoy a wide variety of leisure activities . Some hunt , others take pack trips to escape city life , still others just settle for an enjoyable walk or picnic in pleasant surroundings . Our woods have become more and more of a refuge from the workaday world where men and women of all ages can relax and have fun . // ... if you plan properly If you 're going into the woods this fall , some advance planning will make your trip more enjoyable . Proper preparations can help you avoid discomfort , exhaustion or injury . Do n't be too ambitious when you choose a place to go to in the woods . Let 's not play Daniel Boone and tackle a rugged wilderness right away . Boone was used to that kind of life , you might not be . If you 're not yet an experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , where trails are marked , campsites are provided and the terrain is not too difficult . You 'll have more fun and fewer bruises . // Know the land ... Before you pack up and go , find out about the place you 're going to . There is plenty of literature available on most state and federal lands . For state land , contact the state conservation agency . For federal land , write the Agriculture or Interior Department , Washington , D.C. // Your inquiries should cover trails ( what condition are they in ? ) , water supply ( is drinking water safe or must it be boiled ? ) , fire regulations ( will you need a permit to build a fire ? ) , campsites ( how well are they furnished ? ) and natural hazards ( snow , rock slides , animals and poisonous plants ) . // ... dress accordingly ... You do n't have to buy an expensive wardrobe . Just use old clothes , but make sure they are still sturdy , that they fit well and give you ample @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for maximum protection against scratches , bites and bruises . And even if there 's nary a cloud in the sky when you enter the woods , take a raincoat or poncho with you . Many recommend a windproof and water-repellent feather-weight parka ( about $11 ) . A good soaking can be very uncomfortable . In cold weather , you 'll keep warm better if you wear two layers of light clothes rather than one heavy layer . Make sure you check to see if there is an open game season in the area at the time . If so , wear something red to protect yourself from hunters . // ... and be good to your feet Take care of your feet . They 're your means of transportation , so be good to them . Wear light wool socks for maximum absorption of perspiration . If your feet are tender and blister easily from friction , wear two pairs . Your shoes should be rugged and able to withstand rough going . Wear rubber soles and heels for good gripping . // Travel light Do n't overload yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quickly . A knife , matches , first-aid kit and food are about the only real necessities . If you 're in wild country with no marked trails , an ax and compass are also recommended . You can take either a sheath knife or a jackknife with utility blades . They cost $1.50 to $21 . For matches , make sure you have a waterproof container ( 95 ? ) . Your first-aid kit can be bought for $1.50 and does n't have to be a portable hospital . Adhesive bandages , gauze , tape , burn ointment and disinfectant will do nicely . // For food , concentrate on nourishing things like meat , chocolate and cheese , together with thirst-quenchers like lettuce and tomatoes . Many experienced woodsmen recommend a lunch of chocolate ( which now comes in bars that wo n't melt in hot weather ) , lettuce leaves , a slice of cheese , a handful of raisins and an apple . This pocket-sized meal fulfills all energy needs . // Check out When you reach the jumping-off point , check the latest conditions with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him know you 're in the area , in case you get lost . It 's best to stick to the trails , and it 's useful as well as fun to make a rough map of prominent landmarks in the area so that you can get your bearings at all times . Whenever possible do your hiking with someone else . This " buddy system " can save your life in the event of serious mishap as your partner can go for help . Try to resist the temptations of hacking at trees and shrubs to blaze a trail with a knife or ax . Most trees will die eventually if their bark is injured . Carry a piece of chalk and mark trees as you go . It 's effective and not harmful . // Hit the road Now that you 're all set , try to get an early start . The morning hours are best for hiking , especially in the summer when the noonday sun is very warm . Keep up a steady pace with a comfortable gait , walking with toes pointed straight ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tread lightly on your heels , then push up off your toes for maximum comfort in your stride . If you 're hiking in a group , travel single file . About eight to a group is maximum size for a hiking party , with one of the best hikers bringing up the rear . Watch for holes , overhanging branches and other hazards , and warn the person following you . Pace yourself according to the distance you plan to travel . If you walk along a highway , always face the traffic . // Camping out If you 're going to camp out be particularly careful about fires . When building one , clear a five-foot circle of anything that will burn . If the forest floor is covered with several layers of leaves , get some rocks and build your fire on them . Always be sure to have enough sand or water on hand to extinguish your fire even before you build it . Before leaving , douse your fire with water , stir it , then cover it with sand and wait until you 're sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be boiled , keep it boiling for at least five minutes to remove all impurities . Then pour the pure water from one clean container to another several times to restore air and remove the flat taste . // Your surroundings You 'll enjoy identifying trees , plants and flowers along your route . Bird life in the woods is infinitely varied and fascinating , but you 'll need a sharp eye to spot many birds against their protective background . The rocks will tell you tales of what the area was like millions of years ago . Inexpensive guidebooks ( 25 ? ) will help you in all of these studies . You 'll probably see many animals . Look at them all you please , but leave them alone . Some may get cantankerous if you bother them . // Snakes ... Anyone walking in strange country should check carefully on the snakes native to the area . Poisonous snakes are to be found in most parts of the country , but this is no reason to avoid the woods . Just be careful in stepping over logs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared , special kits are available ( up to $5 ) for treating snake bite . Get to know what all snakes look like . Then you 'll be able to identify the poisonous ones and give them a wide berth . // ... and snake bite Remember , most snakes are scared to death of you . Usually they bite only and snake bite if provoked , to defend themselves . A poisonous snake bite will usually leave two large punctures in the flesh . These rapidly become dark , producing immediate and severe pain . Send for help immediately and keep the victim immobile and calm to prevent the spread of the poison . Apply a tourniquet a few inches above the fang marks , make small X-shaped cuts in each fang mark a quarter inch long and a quarter inch deep , then apply suction to remove the poison . Suck the poison out and spit it away .
