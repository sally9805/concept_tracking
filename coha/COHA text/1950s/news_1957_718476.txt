txt The Eisenhower Administration put before a generally receptive , though troubled , Congress today its proposed manifesto against any Communist aggression in the Middle East . There was every indication that the Democratic Eighty-fifth Congress at length would grant the military force needed if the President considers one necessary to meet a Soviet or Sovietsupported military lunge in that area . Also sought , and also likely to be granted , is a special $400 , - 000,000 program of economic aid to the Middle East . Secretary of State Dulles took to the Capitol a draft of a proposed resolution proclaiming the intentions of the Administration concerning the Middle East . Summary by Senators The Senate Committee on Foreign Relations issued a summary of Mr. Dulles ' talks with its members . It said : " The Secretary viewed the resolution as a deterrent to aggression and as a positive action on behalf . of peace . Without the resolution , he thought the danger of war would be increased . " He stressed that this was purely a preliminary discussion and that the committee would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter thoroughly during further consideration of the problem . " Mr. Dulles took the resolution first before a meeting of the Democratic and Republican leaders in the House of Representatives , the senior members of that chamber 's Foreign Affairs and other committees , and others in the top echelons of both parties . Rayburn 's Position Given No final decision on the text was made , it was disclosed later by Representative Sam Rayburn of Texas , the House Speaker . Mr. Rayburn 's position was that the draft of the text was the responsibility ultimately of the Congressional committees on foreign affairs and that these bodies could be counted upon to make all the necessary inquiry and draw up the proper document with Administration advice . Mr. Rayburn was prepared to // have the President come to Congress on Friday to deliver a message outlining his plans . Whether the President would do , this , or defer it , remained to be seen . After - leaving the House side , Mr. ' Dulles met for two hours and a half- tonight with the Republican and Democratic leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His first consultation on the subject with the committee produced significant changes in emphasis , though not in sub stance , of the . Administrations plan . The White House announcement yesterday had not , mentifined the ' United Nations . But the committee 's communique , issued with Mr. Dulles ' approval , stressed that any action by the United States would " hate to be consonant " with the United Na%ions Charter " and with ac tions or recommendations of the United Nations . " The retiring chairman , Senator Walter F. George , Democrat of Georgia , reported that several members had suggested that obligations to the United Nations be emphasized . However , he said the fact remained that the United States would not " necessarily " be limited by any prior recommendation of the United Nations in moving against aggression . Aimed at Only Overt Acts . What is being sought by the President , he said , is authority to meet only " overt " armed aggression beyond Communist subversion . The United States , he said , would move only against agression by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " agent " of communism . Syria , he said under questioning , is not now regarded as such an " agent , " in spite of Communist influence there . The committee summary observed that- the Administration 's thinking was " based on the premise that there is a highly dangerous situation in the Middle East ? and that unless the United States moves to bolster the free nations of the area the Soviet Union ' may well move to expand ? its-own influence . " The intention was to reach a gentlemen 's agreement with the Senate ; if not an explicit agreement , on every word of the resolution , before it reaches Capitol Hill . While the Administration mainly seeks the-support of Congres for possible use of military force in. the ' Middle East  --  conditioned upon a request for United States assistance from any victim of Soviet-inspired assault ? Mr. Dulles also emphasized the value of the new program of economic aid in stabilizing conditions . The Secretary 's consultation with the House leaders was said , by informants representing both ' parties to have produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good many questions , ? however , remained . The prospective new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , Representative Thomas S. Gordon , Democrat of Illinois , told reporters that he intended to hold " full " hearings and would invite as witnesses former Presidents Herbert Hoover and Harry Truman and former Democratic Secretaries of State ' James F. Byrnes and Dean Acheson . Mr. Gordon , whose elevation to the chairmanship will not be official until tomorrow when ? the new Congress is organized , spoke of the probability that hearings would run to the end of this month . Long Hearings Doubtful Powerful Democrats in the House , however , may be expected not to look with favor on so prolonged a proceeding . The fundamental situation among the controlling Democrats in Congress is this : Many ( indeed , many Republicans , too ) are greatly troubled at what they consider to be the Administration 's sudden proclamation of a grave Middle Eastern crisis that had ' not previously been known to exist . The Democrats had been deeply anxious to inquire into the policy which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two months ago taking a line that the United Nations was the place for the solution of Middle Eastern problems and that any involvement of United States forces was out of the question . Nevertheless these Democrats  --  or all except a few  --  are not prepared to appear to be obstructing the President now that the issue has been dramatized before the world by the Administration . Javits Endorsee Plan A strong endorsement of President Eisenhower 's new Middle Eastern policy was made yesterday by Attorney General Jacob K. Javits . Mr. Javits , who will assume his seat in the United States Senate next Wednesday said that he had long advocated such a policy . He spoke at a reception given in his honor at the WaldorfAstoria Hotel by the American Zionist Committee for Public Affairs . The President 's plan , Mr , Javits said , if properly implemented can be " the beginning of reassurance to the world that World War III will not ' start in the Middle East crisis ; to Israel that it will not again be submitted to the intolerable threats to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom el Suez ; Canal operations from- - be. ing tied ' ' to Egyptian political control .
