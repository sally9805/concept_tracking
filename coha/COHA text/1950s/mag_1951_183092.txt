Royal Wedding ( MGM ) illustrates what is wrong with most splashy Techni-colored cinemusicals-and how entertaining they can sometimes be in spite of it . <P> The film lacks the pace and style of a good Broadway show ( or of MGM 's own On the Town ) . Its songs &; dances serve merely as interludes in the kind of plot that cinemagoers know too well . But within these tired limits , the movie offers some amusing comedy , expert staging of individual numbers , bright lyrics by Alan Jay ( Brigadoon ) Lerner and , best of all , Fred Astaire who , at 51 , has never danced with greater skill or ingenuity . <P> Ironically , Royal Wedding 's plot seems no less a banal fiction for patterning itself loosely on the true story of how the famed dance team of Adele &; Fred Astaire broke up . The movie 's Astaire and his sister-partner ( Jane Powell ) are musicomedy favorites who dabble in an occasional romance , but shun matrimony on the theory that they owe themselves exclusively to their joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , romance pairs Jane with a young peer ( Peter Lawford ) and Fred with a chorus girl ( competently played by Winston Churchill 's daughter , Sarah ) . <P> Lyricist Lerner 's script touches up the story with such humorous byplay as a sly spoof of etiquette in a London pub on the eve of the royal wedding . It also gives Comedian Keenan Wynn a chance to shine in the double role of a brash , slang-spewing Broadway agent and the Oxford-accented twin . <P> Despite Actress Powell 's willing energy , Astaire 's best dancing partner turns out to be a clothes tree . Picking it up as a rehearsal prop , he uses it to create a little masterpiece of grace , timing and inventiveness . He scores again in two other numbers that take imaginative advantage of the screen 's technical magic . In one , he hoofs all over a room 's ceiling and walls ; in the other , he and Partner Powell work the lurching of an ocean liner into their shipboard act . Their best number together , matching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rowdy comic song with a title that sets some kind of record : How Can You Believe Me When I Say That I Love You When You Know I 've Been a Liar All My Life ? <P> The Groom Wore Spurs ( Fidelity ; Universal-International ) tries to poke fun at a singing cowboy movie star ( Jack Carson ) who is a bit of a stinker , fears horses and can not sing . Though the idea seems worth a farce , it is clumsily turned , geared to a creaky romance ( involving Ginger Rogers as a lawyer ) and powered by melodramatic nonsense . The joke proves to be not so much on western heroes as on Hollywood farceurs . <P> Fourteen Hours ( 20th Century-Fox ) . A suicidal young man named John Warde stood the U.S. on its ear 13 years ago when he perched all day on the 17th-floor ledge of Manhattan 's Gotham Hotel before going over the edge . Inspired by Joel Sayre 's New Yorker account , " The Man on the Ledge , " skillful moviemakers have turned one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-documentary drama that bids firmly for 1951 film honors.
