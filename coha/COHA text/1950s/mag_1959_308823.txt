The skinny , green-eyed guy with the hurt , hesitant frown looked like a loser - the kind of character who can never quite cope with life 's ludicrous little defeats . Wherever he slouched in front of an audience-last month on the bare bandstand of a Chicago nightclub , this week before the unforgiving cameras of Ed Sullivan 's TV show-it seemed hardly probable that sad-sack Monologuist Shelley Berman could deliver . <P> Shelley scarcely seems to try . He merely offers solemn , almost sorrowful comments on some of the irritating incongruities of modern life . Take air travel , says Shelley , with the carefully controlled tension of a man who has already taken altogether too much . " I never have the slightest doubt about my safety in a plane until I walk into an airport terminal and realize that there is a thriving industry in this building selling life insurance policies . . . What they do by this power of suggestion is that they plant the seed of doubts into an already chicken human being . " <P> " In Here , Slob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diffidence , a perfection of timing-suggests that everyone in the audience shares his feeling . And as simply as that , Shelley puts Mister Kelly 's Chicago nightclub or Mr. Sullivan 's fans in his pocket . <P> " Going further with that power of suggestion , " Shelley continues , " you recall the little slot behind the seat in front of you ? There 's one item in this little slot which is the most ominous item in the whole damn plane . It 's a little , innocent-looking white bag . There are instructions on the back in three different languages , French , Italian and Hebrew . And all they 're saying , freely translated , is Tn here , slob . In here . ' " <P> From that uneasy airplane flight to the occasion " when you get that subtle secret message that says , ' Go ! ' and you plunge , and it 's a passionate kiss , and it 's off center , and you wind up with the tip of her nose in the corner of your mouth , " Shelley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxieties and embarrassments . He has been recording them for as long as he can remember . <P> " I 've Got Money . " Born and brought up in Chicago , Shelley , 32 , says that even in his early days he played to the crowd . " As I grew older , I became more proficient at being a showoff . I was a pretty good loudmouth . I was the guy at parties . You know-that clod who determines the mood of the gathering . My whole act is confession . Every word I say , I 'm admitting something . " <P> Shelley is willing to confess that the act he originally planned for himself was never meant for the likes of The Ed Sullivan Show . When he was discharged from the Navy as an asthmatic in 1943 , he was 17 , and he entered Chicago 's Goodman Theater to study acting . " I was pretty damn good , " he confesses further , but he would end up working at a Daytona Beach , Fla. hotel . ( " I ran around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bothered . " )
