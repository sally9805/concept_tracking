In his middle age , a Belgian painter named James Ensor once complained that he was " infected with respectability . " It bothered him , he said , that well-bred young ladies who used to turn their backs on him " now smile at me with all their teeth . " But if Ensor became respectable , it was the age that had changed , not Ensor . He kept on painting some of the most ghoulishly disagreeable canvases of modern times-and heard himself hailed as Belgium 's greatest 20th-century artist . Last week , two years after his death at 89 , Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art put on a retrospective show of his work . <P> Actually , there were two Ensors-the young man who painted some mild early pieces of impressionism , and the mature craftsman of disagreeableness . The Museum of Modern Art arranged its exhibit so that visitors would see the mild stuff first . But the early Ensors , e.g. , pleasant home-town scenes such as Ostend Rooftops and Afternoon at Ostend , quickly gave place to the later ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banquet of the Starved , a macabre dumb-show entitled Masks Confronting Death . His most famous picture , Entry of Christ into Brussels in 1889 ( TIME , May 15,1950 ) , was there too . It portrayed Christ as a tiny figure at the top of a pyramid of grinning masks , so shocked Ensor 's contemporaries that it was not displayed in public until 1929 , 41 years after it was painted . It was still unpleasant . <P> Ensor 's story is the story of an artist rebuffed who turned misanthrope . " All rules , all canons of art , " he said in his mature misanthropy , " vomit death . " He dressed his subjects in leering masks , pitted them in futile struggles against each other . Even his own family was not proof against his scorn . In The Artist 's Mother in Death , he stretched his mother 's gaunt , grey-faced corpse ironically alongside a menacing array of medicine bottles . Although he never left Belgium , Ensor 's pictures helped set off detonations all over Europe . " I indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I look at my drawings of 1877 I find cubist angles , futurist explosions , impressionist flakings , dada knights and constructivist structures . " Some Ensor followers : Swiss Paul Klee , Russian Marc Chagall , Belgian Paul Delvaux . <P> The respectability Ensor professed to fear finally overtook him , and he yielded without a struggle . In 1929 King Albert made him a baron . Before his death in 1949 , he saw his paintings hung in most of Belgium 's museums . In Ostend , a tablet was placed on the wall of his house , a street was named for him , and a statue was erected . Artist Ensor unveiled the statue himself .
