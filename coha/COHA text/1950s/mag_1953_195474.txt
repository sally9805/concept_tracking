The generation of Russians taught by Pravda that Stalin was the greatest agriculturalist , philologist , geneticist , political scientist and military commander was told last week , just as categorically : " No matter how experienced leaders are , no matter what knowledge and talents they possess , they can not succeed in replacing the whole collective . The most important principle is that decisions should be based on the experience of many , should be the fruit of collective creation . " <P> <P> When this principle is violated , certain leaders begin " to conduct themselves like autocrats . . . as if they alone knew everything , as if only they can say anything relevant and forceful , and as if it is the task of others only to support their opinion . In such an environment , there is created favorable ground for lack of principle , for alien morals , for toadyism and servility . " <P> Having so crisply and accurately described Stalin 's reign , Pravda added that of course it did n't mean Stalin : " The circumstances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in certain degree were justified . " But , it continued , " leaders can not take a critical statement aimed at them as a personal offense . " <P> At the very least , Pravda 's little sermon represents 1 ) a step in the unmaking of the Stalin legend , 2 ) one more indication that Russia is not now ruled by one man , i.e. , Malenkov , but by a directorate . In New York , the Daily Worker , which has been having the devil 's own time trying to find a party line to follow , significantly hedged its bet last week . After an initial hesitation , the Worker had firmly called the new regime " the Malenkov government . " Last week , in a classically awkward phrase , it urged Eisenhower to meet with " heads of the Soviet state like Malenkov. "
