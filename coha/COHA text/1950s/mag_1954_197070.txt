A politician once said that between elections Hoosiers firmly believe in a four-party system : two Republican and two Democratic . For the past 18 months Indiana 's two Republican parties have been illustrating the proposition by engaging in a bitter political war . Last week , in the wake of primaries that shifted control of the party organization , there were few signs of a truce . <P> Ever since June 1952 , when Lawyer George North Craig of Brazil , Ind . went after the nomination for governor , Indiana 's two Senators , Bill Jenner and Homer Capehart , have opposed him . Craig , onetime national commander of the American Legion , won the nomination , and five months later was elected by the biggest landslide in Indiana history . <P> Craig , a blunt , direct-spoken politician who was governor at 43 , did not bury the hatchet . In dispensing state patronage and favors , he ignored followers of Capehart and Jenner . In late December , before the governor had even taken office , Jenner warned : " George Craig will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Craig encountered stronger resistance . A rebellious state senate , presided over by a Jenner man ( and with a 4-to-i G.O.P. majority ) , took Craig 's ambitious program and gave it a severe hacking . <P> Craig retaliated by using his patronage power , which was infinitely stronger than the federal patronage leverage available to Jenner and Capehart . Since practically no state employees enjoy job tenure in Indiana , the patronage-poor Senators were soon complaining that Craig was buying allegiance to his side with jobs . <P> Last January they counterattacked . In a swift and skillful political coup , while Craig was keeping a speaking engagement in Topeka , Kans .. they ousted Noland Wright , pro-Craig chairman of the Republican state committee , and installed 32-year-old Paul Cyr , an O.S.S. veteran of World War II , handpicked by Jenner and Capehart . <P> But Cyr could not run his machine without fuel-and the Senators could not supply him with enough jobs . In this month 's party primaries Craig won control of the state committee and replaced Cyr with a Craig man , Alvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much bad grace as they could muster . Said the Senators : " We see no further good to be gained by having fine , loyal Republicans further threatened , coerced , browbeaten and tortured . Therefore , we are recommending to all our loyal friends that the Republican banner in Indiana fly under the leadership of George Craig . . . and men of his ilk . "
