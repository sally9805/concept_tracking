Black topsoil , rolling 350 miles west and south of Buenos Aires , has nourished Argentina 's agricultural past ; but for its heavy-industrial future , Argentina is looking toward continent's-end Patagonia . Outwardly , Patagonia seems little more than 300,000 sq . mi. of wasteland lashed by 60-m.p.h. antarctic winds , blinded by spinning dust devils , cursed by endless drought that is relieved by only 5 in. of rain a year . Its 500,000 inhabitants earn a rugged living by running 18 million sheep and 1,500,000 goats on scrub grass . <P> Yet hostile Patagonia hides riches that can make the difference between boom and bust for Argentina 's dollar-short wheat-beef economy . With a new " Operation Patagonia " and with massive infusions of foreign capital , President Arturo Frondizi has high hopes of unlocking the treasure house . He has already kicked off Operation Patagonia with a series of projects . One is a $149 million El Chocn hydroelectric project on the Limay River by a 27-firm British-French-Italian combine to provide 650,000 kw of power , irrigate 250,000 acres of parched croplands . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron ore found twelve years ago south of the Negro River . The government has also approved plans by Houston 's Butadiene &; Chemical Corp . to invest $40 million for three big petrochemical plants for synthetic rubber , carbon black and butadiene gas near Comodoro Rivadavia , plus another $17 million for an aviation-gasoline plant . <P> Power , iron and petrochemicals are only a few of the possibilities from a land that Charles Darwin once dismissed as " without habitation , without water , without mountains . " Beneath the dry plains rest oil deposits that promise at least the possibility of Argentine self-sufficiency . Already 1,952 wells are pumping , but oilmen say there are major untapped pools underground . Standard Oil Co . ( N.J. ) has 1,184,000 acres in promising country north of the Limay River , will soon drill its first well , has begun work on a 14-in. pipeline to Bahia Blanca . <P> Coal deposits at El Turbio are estimated at 400 million tons , enough to supply Argentina for two centuries . Frondizi 's government coal monopoly has signed a $42 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 250,000-ton output . And prospectors from Argentina 's Atomic Energy Commission have found rich uranium deposits . <P> In the remote provinces , where wolves once roamed , 25,000 new settlers have arrived since June 1958 to practice what Frondizi preaches : " The fundamentals for national achievement are petroleum , coal , electricity , heavy chemicals . These mean liberty , democracy , self-determination and well-being . "
