txt The nation 's defense budget is being increased by roughly a billion dollars . What does it get for it ? And who gets it ? The tentative decision to up defense costs to about 35.5 billion dollars was taken at the recent White House conferences between the President , his top aides , and congressional leaders . It would be wrong to conclude that the United States is going to get a lot of new equipment as a result of this billion dollars that has been tacked on the defense budget . It also would be wrong to conclude that the billion-dollar increase is entirely a direct result of the - collapse of the Geneva spirit  --  that Soviet intransigeance has pushed up American military expenses . The billion-dollar increase in defense spending is roughly going for the following things : Costs Cut Output More pay for defense personnel , including pay raises voted during the past session of Congress : Higher costs of weapons , due to increased cost of material and labor .  - -  OLcourse there will be some increase in such items as new weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States is not going to get a billion dollars more in defense as a result of this billion-dollar increase in the defense budget . It is rather going to get roughly the same defense at a billion dollars more in cost . Rising prices raise the cost of weapons and equipment . Wage increases in industry raise the cost of the military hardware ordered . Also the newest weapons  --  supersonic planes , guided missiles . and electronic devices ? get more intricate and complex by the hour . And as they get more complicated they get more costly . That is natural  --  but it is expensive . All Wanted More Estimates vary , but according to most reports circulating in the capital the Air Force gets the lion 's share of this billion-dollar increase  --  possibly $700 , - 000,000 . That would raise its budget to $17,200,000,00 . The Navy is expected to get roughly $200,000,000 of the billion-dollar increase , raising its total to $9 , - 700,000,000 . The Army would pick up an additional $100,000 , - 000 , raising its total to $8,600 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the services got as much as each felt it needed . The Air Force wanted more money for modernization of fighters and fighter bombers . The Navy wanted a full billion dollars . to speed up fleet modernization . The Army 's increase practically amounts to a decrease  --  what with increased costs and everything . The reason rests on the premise that the United States is now operating on ? namely , that some stockpiling of artillery , tanks , ammunition , etc. , is good and necessary , but that a lot of stockpiling is unwise . The theory is that if there is a next war it presumably will be short  --  but hardly sweet . Nuclear weapons should settle a war rather quickly . But if ; they did not , then production lines could be started up again for the long haul . Not all the high brass accept this thesis  --  but the decision appears to have bedn taken by the civilian bosses . And so army procurement is taking a beating in these revised figures . Also army manpower is being cut back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 18 regimental combat teams ( the equivalent of six more divisions ) there will be 19 divisions and 11 regimental combat teams . And of these 19 divisions only 12 will be kept at combat strength . Democrats Back Move It is actually the Democrats , who now control Congress , who have been most concerned over the defense reductions as advanced and practiced by the Eisenhower administration . Therefore the congressional support for more defense spending ? although not entirely on party lines , finds the Democrats strongly supporting the proposed billion-dollar increase ? in fact , pressing for more defense . In other words , the proposed billion-dollar increase does not primarily reflect the post-Geneva world situation , nor does it satisfy the Democratic insistence for more security  --  particularly in air defense . It is not United States reaction to Soviet action at Geneva or in the Middle East . All it is , in effect , is a. revising of last summer 's figures to bring them in line with current costs . It is a bookkeeping project , a financial readjustment  --  not the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased Soviet menace .
