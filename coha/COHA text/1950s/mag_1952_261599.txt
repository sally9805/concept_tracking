Backstage at Denver 's Coliseum one night last week , Dwight Eisenhower ran a hand over his bald head . " I want to be sure everything is on straight , " he quipped . Then , as Colorado 's Governor Dan Thornton boomed out an introduction , blue velvet curtains opened and the green Chevrolet convertible in which Ike sat rolled out on to the floor of the arena , made a half circle and came to a stop . Stepping briskly up the steps to the podium , Eisenhower began a speech which foreshadowed the kind of presidential campaign he hopes to make . <P> Changing Trains . Addressing himself primarily to the Eisenhower clubs which were rallying throughout the country in honor of " Eisenhower Day , " Ike made a ringing appeal to America 's youth whose support he believes essential to a revitalized Republican Party . " The meaning and satisfaction of your lives , " said he , " are bound up with America 's future . . . All that I have to say tonight is based on my strong conviction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes and aspirations into effective political action , the better it will be for all of us ... <P> " Countless Americans want to change political trains . . . You young people both in and out of these Eisenhower clubs are helping to get that train ready and on the right track . It is a Republican train on a Republican track . " <P> His lip curled in contempt , Ike lambasted the governmental corruption uncovered during Harry Truman 's Administration . " We have had corruption before , " he declared , " but never before has it reached such epidemic proportions . . . In little more than twelve months of this year and last , 117 persons in the Bureau of Internal Revenue alone were fired for dishonesty or other improper activities . " That number does not include those who were allowed to resign " because of ill health . " Laughter rolled through the crowd of 11,000 and , for the only time during the speech , Ike smiled . <P> Black Monuments . Without naming either F.D.R. or Harry Truman , Eisenhower by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist threat , both at home &; abroad . " We have been too ready for too long to trust a godless dictatorship , " he said grimly . " Think of the places that stand as black monuments to this misplaced trust . Our loss of China , a divided and almost naked Germany , the enslaved countries of the Baltic and the Balkans , the long and bloody struggle in Greece . " That morning , Ike had said goodbye to his son , Infantry Major John Eisenhower , who is soon to leave for service in Korea . " Today , " he said , " the consequences of this misplaced trust come home to everyone of us in the war in Korea . " A sense of identification with the people as well as the policies of the U.S. , a dynamic tone , long missing from Republican speeches , sounded in Ike 's final words : " For many years , I have been a commander of American youth . In the cause of America 's youth , I am now theirs to command . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
