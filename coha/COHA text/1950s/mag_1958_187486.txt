Jazz once meant improvised music . Now jazzmen have taken to improvising musical instruments . Some of the weirdest recorded jazz sounds currently around come from a " gooped up " harpsichord and a clavichord caught by a closeup microphone . They are the products of two men from different sides of the musical tracks : 48-year-old Texan Red Camp , who supports himself by giving piano lessons in Corpus Christi , and Manhattan 's Bruce Prince-Joseph , 32 , the pianist , harpsichordist and organist of the New York Philharmonic . <P> Jazzman Camp wields his gallused , honky-tonk style on an Emory Cook record called The New Clavichord . The old-fashioned clavichord has a gentle tinkle , but partly through the recording technique , Camp gives such numbers as Wing and a Prayer and Cocktails for Two an ice-edged , splintered sound full of white fire and ghostly glimmer . In Slow Slow Blues he etches some wonderfully spidery lines . The sound is not for everybody , but Camp is convinced : " It brings out the contrapuntal lines . It lends itself to blues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acid , Pianist Prince-Joseph , in his album Anything Goes ( RCA Camden ) , coaxes surprisingly sensuous sonorities out of his pedal harpsichord . His album achieves a fusion of styles that he refuses to label either jazz or classical . In I Could Have Danced All Night , for instance , he starts with a theme from Rodolfo 's aria , Che gelida manina from La Bohme , develops the second chorus as a Mozart sonatina , cuts loose briefly with a sample of stride harpsichord , returns to Bohme in the coda . The album should send hi-fi bugs skittering , but no sound on it is as fascinating as the musical imagination that puts them together . <P> Other jazz records : <P> John Coltrane with the Red Garland Trio ( Prestige ) . Tenor Saxophonist Coltrane swings his raucous solos like a truncheon in such numbers as Trancing In and Bass Blues , but the honors here go to Pianist Garland , whose lean , light-fingered attack and delicate sense of mood never falter . <P> The Cooker ( Lee Morgan , trumpet ; Pepper Adams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chambers , bass ; " Philly " Joe Jones , drums ; Blue Note ) . A talented group cooks up some minor frenzies , e.g. , A Night in Tunisia , Heavy Dipper , with unabashed spontaneity and irresistible drive . The prize sound is Gillespie Protg Morgan 's trumpet , which speaks hard and clear even when it is going like sixty . <P> Great Ideas of Western Mann ( Herbie Mann 's Californians ; Riverside ) . Flutist Mann abandons his favorite instrument for one of the least likely of solo instruments-the bass clarinet . The fudge-thick sound has a wistful , funky charm , but often Soloist Mann evokes a fat man in a conga line . <P> Swedish Modern Jazz ( Arne Domnerus and His Group ; RCA Camden ) . The Swedes swing lightly and flexibly through Topsy Theme , Gone With the Wind and other numbers with the air of men with their hearts in their horns , but in their cooler moments ( Relax , Blue Moon ) they sometimes seem about to fade off the record . Alto Saxophonist Domnerus wanders through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benny Carter 's books .
