Emperor Hirohito , Son of Heaven , last week took his first airplane ride . Dressed in light blue with a red polka-dot tie , he sat diffidently through the flight in a curtained-off compartment opposite his little , moonfaced Empress Nagako and pored studiously over an airline map , nodding from time to time as a stewardess announced the landmarks passing below . <P> He was returning from his first visit since the war to Japan 's northernmost islands of Hokkaido and Honshu . Two hours and one minute after taking off , the Emperor stepped again on terra firma at Tokyo , looking much less nervous than he had before . Crowds of his smiling subjects greeted him with banzais , while news photographers , perched on ladders high above the Emperor 's head , told him when to take off and put on his straw skimmer hat . <P> The gentle smile that flickered over Hirohito 's bespectacled face gave no indication that he was anything but pleased at the democratic display . The celestial mystique that Japan 's U.S. - dictated Constitution sought to destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18-day tour was dramatic proof of the change . Too Human . Some Japanese conservatives today would like to restore the old imperial symbolism and put Hirohito behind a bamboo screen like his great-grandfather Komei , who used to sit hidden , with only his bony knees and frail legs showing when he conferred with members of the state council . But the fact is that Hirohito himself , a constitutional mon arch without real power , has become far too human to be easily raised again to semidivine status . In the years since the war , he has grown paunchier , more stooped , and greyer at the temples . His walk more than ever resembles that of a duck . But the huge crowds who gathered to greet him with paper flags , banzais and sometimes tears in Hokkaido were not the awed , head-lowering crowds before the war . They offered Hirohito something they had never offered his ancestors-plain affection . <P> At Sapporo , the Emperor watched a schoolroom full of crippled children struggling painfully to their feet to greet him , and he bowed deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Kushiro he ate the plain buckwheat noodles and mackerel of the local villagers . When his glasses needed wiping , he handed his straw hat to his Empress , who held it obediently . <P> Too Poor . Since Japan 's imperial palace burned down in 1945 , Hirohito and Nagako have lived on the palace grounds in an unimpressive , unpretentious 14-room house that began its life as an airraid shelter . Each day they breakfast on oatmeal , toast and bacon , have chicken or steak for lunch and only consent to Japanese dishes at supper . The Emperor 's favorite food is persimmons , and he keeps careful track of every persimmon that enters the palace lest someone make away with it . A teetotaler who hates tea , Hirohito cheers himself with lukewarm water when guests are imbibing stronger drink .
