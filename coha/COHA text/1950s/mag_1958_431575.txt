 | How Good Is Russia 's Everyday Technology ? @# HOW much of the brilliant technical skill that Russia showed in launching its earth satellites has been put to work for its own people ? Do they have many of the mass-produced appliances that make life easier for us ? What are their everyday tools and machinery like ? Bringing back firsthand answers to these questions was one of my assignments on a three-week auto trip through the USSR . I talked to Russians in cities from Brest to Yalta . I was in Zaporozhe when Sputnik gave the free world a kick in its complacency the first Russian reactions expressed to me were beaming pride , but no crowing ) . In jam-packed state stores everywhere I watched Russians jostle each other to buy such things as vacuum cleaners , TV sets , toys and electric kettles . hew of the things I studied would sell in competition with ours . Many had the shabby look of rummage-sale goods : some were downright crude . Soviet manufacture is a curious blend of competence and carelessness . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be hasty copies of our own or German designs . But the meaningful thing , I was convinced , is not that Soviet tools or typewriters are poorer than ours ; it 's that they are in the shops at all . " Overtake America " is a slogan blazoned from posters and road signs everywhere . This drive has gone beyond propaganda ; the Russian people have bought it as their hope for the good things of life . " If there is no war , " I was told repeatedly , " our system will outproduce yours in 15 years . " I left Russia convinced that we would be wrong to shrug off this boast . It is wishful thinking on our part to picture the Communist world as a backward culture straining a handful of skilled scientists to push through its ICBM and satellite programs . Instead , the Soviets have a tightly planned . enormously accelerated technology that is crowding hard on our heels . Ivan the peasant has already swapped his pitchfork for a turret lathe . Tomorrow he may run an automation keyboard from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Late starter though he is , Ivan --  I learned in one lesson ? is no slouch as a mechanic . The hose attachment for a ferry can I carried would n't clamp on . A good-natured Russian garageman diagnosed the trouble at once : The special , odd-@#  | shaped gasket in the cap was too thick . It raised the clamping lugs too high to slide under the locking clips . " Could you bend up the clips a bit , or file a little off the lugs ? " I asked . He shook his head . " Nyet , gospodin , " he said and trotted off . When he came back he handed me the hose attachment and pointed inside the cap . There , neatly cut from thinner material to a perfect fit , was a specially tailored gasket . Bending , filing or other cobbling plainly shocked him . Paradoxical contrasts often strike a visitor to the Soviet Union . The telephones are handsome instruments Western Electric would n't be ashamed of , and yet light switches often work only the third time around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fine main highways , the network of high-tension lines , the heavy machine tools on display in Moscow . But the plumbing is uncertain and convulsive , when it works at all , and such simple things as locks , latches and building hardware are often erratic or poorly made . There need be no mystery about these shortcomings . Soviet planners put first things first ( Sputniks , for example ) , and there is no private enterprise to jump in at the sight of a possible market . After decades of consumer shortages the Russians are plainly goods-hungry . Every store I visited in a dozen cities was @# @# packed with shoppers . The things they can buy are , by our standards , limited in kind and quality . Often the stores are sol out of popular items ; there are supposed to be four sizes of refrigerators , for example . I saw none . But by Russian standards . things have never been better . Whenever before could Boris buy himself an electric shaver ? Today he has a choice of two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 210 rubles . Prices are high even at the special tourist rate of 10 rubles to the dollar . At the official rate of four to one they become exorbitant-that rotary shaver would cost $52 . Perhaps the most realistic comparison is in terms of a worker 's earnings . The average Soviet wage is less than 800 rubles a month , or about 30 rubles a day . So Boris works seven days for his electric shaver . How can people pay such high prices Goods have been unavailable for so long that many families have built up sizeable cash reserves ( there are plenty of savings banks in the USSR ) . Since the Soviet economy is still one of scarcity , there is more cash than merchandise . This is the Communist form of inflation . It is perhaps one reason why the government last year froze ( in effect , canceled ) the lottery bonds in which workers had been compelled to put one month 's wages a year . When you go shopping in the USSR  | you instantly feel the difference between the Communist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no price cutting , no discounting . Store managers a reduce an item only if it stubbornly : uses to sell , and then only with the permission of the Ministry of Trade . Nobody pressures you into buying an inferior article ; the trouble is that you may not be able to find a better one . I bought a carpenter 's plane for 30 rubles-the only other one available was identical but smaller . Its sole plate is aluminum ? soft and easily nicked . There is no cap iron to turn the shavings ; the blade bevel is flat-ground ; there is no fine adjustin photo at right ) compresses richer charge , forces it past a valve into tiny firing chamber behind plug . Fired by spark , it jets into main cylinder , igniting lean mixture there . Russians say the engine uses 20 percent less fuel . ment for either depth of cut or blade alignment . But the edge is sharp and the plane , carefully set , will do its job ? it 's an adequate but primitive tool . Shopping is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably stepped on a few myself ) before managing to get up to the sales counters . Once you 've caught the attention of the harried salesgirl , she 'll dig up what you ask for ? assuming it 's in stock ? and put it out on the counter for you to examine ( is it from fear of lightfingered comrades that most goods are warily locked up ? ) . Washing machines . In an appliance store I watched a pretty blonde demon-@# e strate a Soviet washing machine to housewife . It had a cylindrical tub al , . 11/2 feet in diameter and 21/2 feet high . fore the wide-eyed housewife , the sal girl showed how the lid hinged back make a splash tray for a hand-crank wringer . Inside , a stamped , finned agita tumbled the clothes at a leisurely pa Its cleaning action was clearly less en getic than ours , and the three-pou clothes capacity was small . But the hou wife was plainly interested despite 750-ruble price . Later , in Kharkov , I sa a slightly bigger machine for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing or automatic cycling ; nor did I see a clothes dryers . Television is beginning to boom in R sia . Moscow now has two stations and v see the antennas sprouting from grasthatched cottages for miles around t city . Many other cities have at least o transmitter on part-time schedules . A two-channel receiver with a sma ( eight-inch ) picture tube sells for 800 rubles . Magnifying lenses are often sold with these sets . A three-channel set with a 12-inch screen comes to 1,900 rubles . If you shoot the works you can have a five-channel job with a 15-inch tube and a phono plug-in for 2,600 rubles ? say $650 , or more than three months of working days . All these are table models , in plain but pleasing wooden cabinets . Picture quality seemed quite as good as that on my own 21-inch RCA at home . The transmitted image is scanned by 600 lines , of which the maximum received is about 450 lines ( our standard is 525 lines , of which we may get as many as 480 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that listeners have a choice of foreign as well as USSR programs . ) I admired a portable in a handsome red plastic case at 340 rubles ; it used either house current or batteries and had excellent pickup on its internal antenna . All my inquiries about transistor radios , however , drew a complete blank . Home radios are sometimes elaborate . A well-styled table model with a six-band chassis and tuning eye was shown for 715 rubles . For 1,200 rubles you are welcome to an elaborate radio-phonograph in a high-grade furniture cabinet . The Russian preoccupation with tuning eyes may make  | sense ; perhaps because of overlapping distant stations and good sensitivity , the sets tried were n't simple to tune . Phonographs come in all sizes . At the bottom of the heap I found a tricky little d-up job with an acoustic reproducer , whole works folding up to about the size of a book . Price : 100 rubles . Electric ord players , with motor , pickup and plifier , start at 350 rubles . Records , incidentally , come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our 10-inch size . The unbreakable plastic ones are both inexpene and well made , with a remarkably low ise level . The record shops are jumping with customers . While U.S. jazz tunes are wned on by the authorities , the kids seem as well posted on them as if they listened to the Hit Parade . Electric power in the USSR is supplied at 127 and 220 volts , 50 cycles . A Russian who shares his apartment with others ? as most do ? can bay an electric meter of his very own to measure his part of the bill . The meter , widely sold , costs him about 170 rubles ; he will probably wire it in himself . The wiring , by the way , would give Underwriters ' Laboratories the fidgets . Sometimes it is exposed knob-and-tube , of a sort we have n't used for a generation . Other times it 's a twisted pair strung casually along walls and ceilings on small stand-off insulators . Plugs , like those elsewhere in Europe , have round rather than flat prongs . Curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a point of buying some new switches . They had generously big wipe contacts , promising long life , but the phosphor bronze seemed less lively than ours . One neat little plastic canopy switch had not only big wipe contacts and ample current rating for its size ( 2.5 amps at 220 volts ) but also the refinement of tiny clamp-screw sockets for the wires instead of the pigtail leads common to ours . I suspect the capricious hotel switches simply reflect careless maintenance . A rather small tank-type vacuum cleaner can be had for 400 rubles , and a more modern drum-type job comes to 650 . An electric motor and foot rheostat to power a sewing machine was tagged at 177 rubles . Although natural gas is piped to Mos-  | cow from 300 miles away , both kern and electricity are extensively used f cooking . A one-burner hot plate costs o 24 rubles ; a handsome electric kettlesembling our whistle kettles ? costs a 60 rubles . ( It was one of the few produ I saw that could conceivably have fou a market at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pans , mainly cast rather than fab cated . Flashlights were out of stock where% I asked for them , though there were plen of batteries ? the kind common in Euro with three cells assembled into a unit a spring terminals emerging from one e I finally managed to buy one flashlight hand-powered , battery-less job ? and lat took it apart . Like so much else in Russ ' it was paradoxical . The generator flywh was well balanced and the drive clut ingenious . But all shafts run in unbushed holes , and the light 's reflector was sloppily plated . For his 34 rubles , Boris gets a lig that works fairly well but could wo much better . Do it yourself seems to be as much part of Russian life as of our own , but a simpler level . Nowhere did I see a power tools , circular saws or even elect drills . ( No doubt these were made , but f industrial use rather than for sale in sta stores . ) The one rather surprising exception was a tiny watchmaker 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was tool to delight a modelmaker . Russian hardware stores bear little resemblance to our well-stocked and gadgetfilled shops . One in Moscow had two small , neat display windows . Inside , all merchandise was out of reach , in glass-topped counters or on wall shelves . There were no displays or display cards ? just price tags Milling customers competed for the attention of the four salespeople , three of them girls . A young man tended a counter of locks , padlocks and door hardware ? products that seemed to me heavily styled and poorly finished , but eminently serviceable . In other glass-topped counters were woodworking , automotive and machinist 's tools , including taps , reamers and micrometers . While many items were stocked . there was little choice among individual ones . Screwdrivers and chisels had poorly  | ground tips and edges , and crude handles . Often Ivan does n't get a ready-to-use tool gets something he can grind , file and polish into a tool . Finish is skimped on many Soviet artiPackaging is also sketchy , with flimsy boxes and childlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no rivals ? ) There are some exceptions ? cigarettes , film and phonograph records ? but most things are finished and packaged with no eye for appearance . Often your purchases are casually wrapped in paper like a few pounds of hamburger . In GUM , a huge Moscow department store , I encountered vestiges of salesman'hip when a salesgirl pointed out that a deuxe alarm clock at 75 rubles was really ? ? tter than a bigger one at 55 . She was , ht , too ; it 's a handsome , skillfully made , ) ck , equivalent to a good Swiss or Ger:an one . ( Incidentally , while there are plenty of clocks on sale in Russia , the rist watches worn by foreigners still have n , same mysterious lure that they did World War II . It is a common experience to be asked by a covetous comrade trade your wrist watch for 500 or even 100 rubles . ) The photo shops I visited had plenty of still and stereo cameras , many of them reflecting East German designs . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a colornegative type of color film . Enlargers , projectors and photoelectric exposure meters are available . The Leningrad meter I bought is sensitive even in dim light , is nicely designed , and gives readings identical with those of a high-quality American meter . There are curious gaps in the line-up of Russian consumer goods . I saw plenty of mechanical pencils and fountain pens ? but no ball-point pens , which are , as a consequence , highly prized . I could n't buy a pencil sharpener , but I was impressed by the variety and quality of drafting instruments . Fluorescent lamps are rare , except in commercial installations , but there 's a profusion of incandescent lamps of all kinds . Unprepared for the concept of Comrade Santa Claus , I was startled to find strings of Christmas-tree lights . The answer here , though , was simple : The lights are manufactured for celebrating New Year 's . END @#
