THE POST REPORTS ON The Changing Midwest What new forces are altering the lives of Americans in the once-isolated midlands ? Here are the results of a reporter 's special assignment to find out what 's happening to Main Street . PART I Rushville , Indiana  --  a small town , a farm town , on the gently rolling Midwest plain , America 's heartland . On a Saturday noun last summer the shady side of Main Street was crowded , women in cotton dresses carrying shopping bags , two men gabbing in front of a clothing store , and teen-age girls skipping in and out of the Louis Ice Cream Shop , where pop was still a nickel . A constant stream of cars moved along Main Street  --  a truck filled with lowing calves , a dusty new sedan with an old farmer at the wheel , three lads in a convertible , their tires squealing as they raced away from the stop light . Moving  --  everybody was restlessly moving . To the casual glance , Haydon 's Hardware Store seemed like any other old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Rushville itself , its exterior concealed unexpected changes : young Richard Haydon sells not only hardware but Chinese rugs and exotic gifts . " My wife and I spent six weeks in Honolulu last winter , " he says , " and we brought back a lot of lovely ivories and jewelry and batik place mats . " On the hill north of the two-block business district stood the old houses , some of them enormous , with great round towers and spires and stained-glass windows , built years ago by retired farmers . Beyond lay the new subdivisions of ranch houses . A corner of the tiny lobby of the Durbin Hotel was called the Willkic Lounge , and pictures of Wendell Willkie campaigning in mo adorned the ! walls ; for NVillkie , who married a Rushville ' girl , had opened his campaign for the presidency from this hotel . At eight e.m . the sun was striking the clock ' tower of the massive stone courthouse . The stores were open tonight , Saturday night ; the sidewalks were crowded ; the town looked busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nut shopping or socializing , as in the past . A hanker said , " Rushville is no longer a Saturday-night shopping town . The farmer has a car , or Iwo cars , and he can send his wife to town any day of the week . The old days are gone . " The Changing Midwest of the best horse regions in the country . Now I dotall if there 's a dorsal horses left doing faun work . " Why the trend to bigger farms ? " Be , you 've got to have machinery . and iivnsive , and if your farm is small , your costs are too high . Twelve years ago , one than with a team and his tools could take cure of eighty acres , Today , with machinery , you eau take care of one hundred sixty . " Had all this forced many farmers of the farm ? " Some have left , They sell the farm , keep the house and a few acres for themselves , and go to work in factories , Some with small farms work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm . Some men work the farms while their wives work in town . About twenty-five per cent of farmers ' wives are working out  --  teaching , nursing , clerking . " What has happened to the family farm ? " We still have family farms . They 're a little larger , that 's all . " Land here was worth $350 an acre , even $500 . A third of the farms were owned by wealthy city men and rented to tenants . Farming was big business . " If a man is going to he on his own farm , he 'd have seventy to eighty-five thousand dollars tied up in land and buildings and machinery and lisestock. " said Spoiler . " I know of a farmer here , back in 1933 he aot started with two hundred fifty dollars cash . Today that would n't even make a down payment on a tractor . " He picked up a clip board and went out and got into his truck , parked by the courthouse lawn , to make sonic calls around the county . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store in town and I S7 acres out in the country , Newton L. Halterman , a tall , spare man of siNtysix , one of the best farmers hereabouts , twice international corn king . " Some of this came back , " Halterman said , gesturing at some bags of seed corn . " It rained the farmers out the first time and it 's too late to plant now . It 's bad enough around here , but northwest and on over into Illinois it 's  --  oh , my  --  it 's bad . They 've really had rain over there . " Were farmers prosperous this year ? " No . Hogs are $20.35 , not too bad , but the price of everything the farmer buys has gone up too high . Four years ago a little eighteen-inch tile cost thirty-five cents . Now they charge you eighty-live . It 's the little items satin ' you up . Costs will never go down till there 's a major depression . Maybe it 's already starting , " and he told how hard a salesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were farmers talking about these summer days ? " Prices and costs and taxes . " Were they interested in other national affairs or foreign affairs ? " Not much , " Halterman said . " You hear some say they do n't like the giveaway programs , " ? that is , foreign aid . Had President Eisenhower lost any popularity ? - Oh , my land , yes . He 's lost some with me , " he said laughing . " Not him personally , but some around him . " He paused , gestured . " It 's so big any more and so complicated the President has to be a figurehead . He ca n't really know what 's going on . " Halterman had been born and raised in Rush County . He had two boys , the elder in the seed business with him , the younger going to Purdue . " A young fellow ca n't hardly get started farming nowadays unless his father helps him , it costs so much , The boys at Purdue do n't pay any attention to the measurements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether she 's a **28;1091;TOOLONG girl or a six-hundred-and ( Continued front Page 19 ) forty-acre girl . It 's their only chance to get started farming , " In his pickup truck , Spuller headed out of town . leaving the main highway and running down a gravel road across the smiling countryside , a windmill beside a white burn , cattle standing in a creek , tall pines and cedars standing before an old frame house spiked with lightning rods , it red-brick church ? " Campbellite Church , " they call it here . Men in overalls were fishing on the riverbank among the weeds . Hollyhocks grew by a mailbox , and sheep walked by a stream ; a wild canary flew up in front of the truck , flashing yellow in the sun . Spuller turned into a farm lane . Across a liekl he could see a green tractor raising a cloud of dust . He waved , and the man on the tractor waved back  --  he 'd he coming in soon . Spuller said , " He 's a tenant farmer . Marion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty more up the road . I do n't see how he does it . " Liggett drove his tractor up to the fence and stopped . He was a husky young fellow of thirty-two in a white T shirt and blue jeans . He had been horn at Lawrenceburg , down on the Ohio River ; his father had passed this way , going to the state fair , " When dad saw this land , he said if you ca n't make it in Rush County , you ca n't make it anywhere . I started housekeeping ten years ago October . Went in debt four thousand five hundred dollars . f was out of debt in five years . " Now he was worth 525,000 in stock and machinery . He owned no land  --  if he sold out for 525,000 , he could only buy about eighty acres and could n't make a living . He was better of renting . In a good year he could probably net 52500 above living expenses . Squinting into the sun , he said , " I tell my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and he laughed , his white teeth flashing . " If I modernize on the farm with something that saves me labor , I aim to get something for Lois . I got her an automatic washer , dryer , ironer . I have a clean shirt and pants every day . We 've got a freezer and a TV . We 're doing all right . " What did he hear farmers talking about ? " Well , this farm program 's pretty unsettled right now . We had a corn referendum , and some fel Irm S just wrote on their ballots that they did n't want any program of any kind . The fellows that arc going into the soil bank are older ; it 's a modified form of social security , really . " Did he hear much talk of national politics ? " No . " How about international affairs ? " The money being spent over there We do n't think 's been doing any good , " he said . " But you do n't hear a lot about it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would expand the farmer 's market . Talk of the 1-1-bomb ? " Not much any more , except this rainy weather  --  they blame it on the bomb , " and he went back to talking about farming . " This land can produce a lot of food and keep on doing it , but you take like petroleum and minerals , there 's an end to that . When the mine 's dug out , its done . But you can keep on raising corn . There 'll be someone else farming this land after you 're gone . " One day six months later , when the fields were brown and farmers were dug in for the winter , Halterman and Liggett came to town and stopped at the county agent 's office , where the price of hogs has been posted on a blackboard daily since 1918 . How had they made out in 1957 ? Both grinned . Halterman said , " We 've got a great deal more money in the bank this year than last , " Hogs were down to 517.25 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I started housekeeping ten years ago , and this is the first tome I 've had money in the bank and been out of debt . I always run two litters of hogs , January and July , and it took all my spring hogs to pay my spring bills , but this year I caught up with my bills and as my fall hogs come in I quit runnin ' and caught my breath a little . " Not all farmers were as well off . Halterman said , " A lot of the younger tenants are still in pretty bad trouble  --  the ones that started since the war  --  started big . borrowed money and bought a lot of equipment . " Halterman was still worrying about the high prices of things he had to buy . And Liggett said he 'd like to have a new car  --  his was seven years old  --  but he 'd make do with the old one . Spoiler nodded . " There for a while everybody was trying to keep up , buying new stuff , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their money . " What were people talking about ? Liggett said , " What they 're going to plant next year . " How about national affairs ? Halterman said , " There 's some talk on the farm program . Not good , not complimentary . " What about national affairs other than agriculture ? Halterman said . " Well , there 's been a lot of excitement around the country about this integration , but you did n't hear it discussed much around here because +. t.e.N 12 been integrated for years and think nothing about it . " In the 1920 's the Ku-Klux Klan had been strong in Rushville , but today about 300 Negroes dwell there in peace . The forebears of some had arrived on the Underground Railroad in Civil War days . Schools and swimming pools were integrated . What had been the reaction here to the trouble at Little Rock ? Halterman said . " What few 1 talked to did n't like it . There 's a lot of States ' - righters around here . " Liggett said , " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they do n't want it forced on ' cm . " Halterman said , " It 's made more propaganda for Russia than the Russians ' moon . " What about the satellite , anyway ? Liggett said , " At ' first there was just jokes about it . Like the joke about the drunk lookin ' at the moon and a guy telling him , ' Do n't worry , buddy , that 's one of ours . ' But a lot of times a fella can kind of hide his real thoughts with a joke . 1 believe that it 's more than a laughing matter . We 've always taken this America first for granted , but the Russians showed us there 's a little competition . " Spoiler said , " It 's beyond me . " Had they heard talk of war ? No ; still , war seemed a remote possibility . Liggett said , " These firecrackers that goes off in the Near East and other places has their day and then they disappear , You take Syria and Turkey  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at an old sow , long as she 's raising Cain with me , snortin ' and gruntin ' . I 'm not scared , but that old sow over in the corner that 's not sayin ' nothing , that 's the one I 'm worried about . It 's the same with Turkey and Syria . " Any interest in national politics ? " No , " Halterman said , " it 's kind of a standstill . " Had Sputnik undermined Eisenhower 's popularity further ? Liggett said , " Not as much as his sickness has overcome . Every time he takes a spell like that he kind of gains back all he 's lost . " Were people concerned about the President 's health ? Liggett said , " I took sonic hogs up to Indianapolis the day after Thanksgiving . Last year they jumped a dollar that day , but this year they did n't , and I tigtme his health does have a lot to do with the economy of the nation . " Was there talk of Eisenhower 's successor ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late November . " Now , " Liggett said . " we all wonder who 's going to take Ins place . Nixon is naturally going to carry a lot of pormlarity . On the Democratic side there are several fellas pretty well on art equal footing . " and he mentioned Governor Clement . of Tennessee , and Senator Kennedy , of Massachusetts . Were people basically contented and undisturbed , as they had been last summer ? " Well , there is some talk of layoffs at the furniture factory . But maybe these defense contracts will pick things up . The satellite and all the rest has n't really disturbed people . You see , ' Fifty-seven was a pretty good year around here , so people are not concerned , You take when you have a good year financially , a lot of the gripes about other things disappear . " Halterman said uneasily . " I 'll tell you one thing that worries people was the last cutback in defense  --  that has caused some unemployment in Indiana . " Spuller said , " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months than in recent years . " Were people here rather indifferent to national or foreign affairs other than agriculture ? Liggett , smiling , said , " I 'll tell you . You 're tired w hen evening comes and you pick up the paper and read national affairs and you just ca n't get enthused . You do n't care who 's fightin ' who , just so you can go to bed peaceful . But you see that the price of nitrogen is coming down  --  now there 's news ! " ? and he laughed , and in a moment he and Halterman and Spoiler , comfortable on their creaking chairs in the county agent 's ancient office , were talking again about hog and fertilizer prices and their plans for farming next year . The Kiwanis Club met at six P.M. in the back room of a restaurant on the courthouse square . About Forty men in business suits ranged themselves behind chairs at a u-shaped table , sang one stanza of America , recited the Pledge of Allegiance , bowed their heads during an invocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessmen , plus two or three farmers , a couple of retired farmers and a minister . A Rushville saying has it that the Lions have all the fun , the Rotarians own the town , and the Kiwanians run it . After dinner , the chairman said that Kiwanis had sent three girls and two boys to a state-wide junior-leader confer . ence at Greencastle and they were here to report . They were , indeed  --  scrubbed teen-agers sitting at the table  --  and in turn they related what they had learned at the conference . One recalled . " We heard a saying . ' There 's only one place where success comes before work , and that 's in the dictionary . ' and I thought that was a good thing to remember . " One remembered a speech on Youth 's Great Decisions . A girl with a pony tail said they had discussed many subjects , including what is the proper age for going steady . The Kiwanians laughed comfortably . The teen-agers were remarkably unabashed in front of the middle-aged audience , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl with the pony tail summed things up , then said , " And we thank Kiwanis for sending us . " The men applauded . There was something rather touching about the proceedings  --  the attention given , the kids ' confident assumption that attention would be given , the simple good humor and calm confidence of it all Afterward , the vice president invited questions , and a farmer , a grandfather , said . " Yeh , I want to know how old you 're supposed to be before you go steady , " It brought down the house . Since the end of the war , other Indiana towns have grown mightily , Rushville has not . Why ? Vance Waggoner , the city attorney , a heavy man with long silver hair , sitting in his office on Ihe courthouse square , said , " This community is still agricultural , and it has its substance in the thinking of retired farmers . The Chamber of Commerce keeps trying to bring industry in , but the trend of the thinking is , ' We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : no question about it , " About 1000 own were living in Rushville and going to work in factories at Indianapolis , Connersville , Shelbyville , New Castle , The practice started during the NS ar  --  Rusht Ole had no defense plants ; other places did . Rush , . ille people enjoyed saying , " We 're a little healthier than these industrial towns , do n't have the terrific ups and downs . In the depression . even , we managed to get by . We did n't apply for WPA projects . We built our swimming pool ourselves , " Waggoner said , " It wo n't be many years till everything is built solidly all the way to Indianapolis . Another decade will tell whether this community stagnates till the development of metropolitan Indianapolis catches up with it , or whether it does something on its own . Rush County has n't grown in sixty years . " None of this meant the town was dying . " There 's civic spirit here . A while back we built a hospital , and we raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a group of younger people , the Junior Chamber of Commerce , idea-a-minute fellows  --  they constantly want to change things . But they have n't got very far . " What were people talking about ? " This is what the late lamented F.D.R. called an isolationist town . We do n't call ourselves that . There 's no talk of foreign affairs around here . but the people are probably doing a lot more thinking than talking . " Did they think themselves prosperous ? He laughed . " They do n't think they 're prosperous , that 's for sure . " Did they , then , talk about the high cost of living ? " No , they do n't . This is n't a boom , but it 's far from a depression . " How were business conditions ? Rushville retailers were being hurt by a big new shopping center between Rushville and burgeoning Indianapolis . And farmors , less prosperous than a few years ago , were n't buying . " It 's a little drag in business , " said Pres. M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The livestock market 's a little better , but it 's still rather rough in agriculture . " Not all factory workers were in clover either . " Layoffs , " said Havens , " And they 're used to overtime pay  --  they 're all set up on credit on an overtime-pay basis , We have a consumer-loan department here , but it 's small , We do n't want to expand it too greatly . If you get too much debt and have a depression , it 'll hurt . I went through one and that 's enough . " he said earnestly . " The latest thing 's the stock-market drop . It 's hard to tell what it means . There 's not enough unemployment for me to get really scared . But people today are worried about inflation and depression , think . " Did he hear talk about the Russian satellite ? " No , not a lot . Matter of fact , nobody around here 's been scared about it . " He laughed nervously . " Just a case of one nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . " In his little office over the tire station off Main Street , Rushville 's first full-time mayor , William Morgan , a stocky. crewcut man of forty-eight , born in Rushville , formerly an auto salesman and tilling-station operator . was worrying about the tight over whether the city-owned power company should be sold or expanded . " That 's all f think about day and night . " He seemed to feel that the fight to preserve the light plant was a battle against the encroachment of giant outside utilities . Had the town changed much in recent years ? " No , not much . it 's composed of many retired farmers -- wonderful people . but they take to change very slowly . I 'm thinking of putting in some one-way streets , and I know that for the first twenty-one days they 'll scream their heads off . " Ile laughed ; then leaning forward , said , " I believe in this community . 1 was raised here ; lived here practically every minute of my life ; just think the world and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ? " A very large percentage of our families have been established families for many generations . We have n't had any foreign element come in , like a factory town has , to upset our tranquillity . Then , good churches and schools . We 're building a new high school now . Then , in a community this size , everyone knows everyone else 's business , but as long as you keep your nose clean , it do n't hurt to have everyone know your business . " Did he hear talk of national affairs ? " I hear a lot of comment about giving taxpayers ' money to foreign countries , Then . of course , segregation is ? We are very fortunate here , the colored people in our town , I suppose ninety per cent of them are old , established families , and we have no trouble with them whatsoever . Of course , people say we do n't know what they have to put up with in Little Rock . About the troops , it seems in Indiana people are divided fifty-fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Little Rock as were against it . But there has n't been too much talk about it here , There has been a lot of conversation about the satellite , " and he laughed a little . " But people seem to think we can retaliate With what we have just as well as they can . " Had the Russian Sputniks hurt Eisenhower 's popularity ? " No . There are a few people who , for political reasons , would try to use things like that . " Were people concerned about war ? " No . They do n't see too much connection between the satellite and war . People here are contented  --  they have been interested primarily in Thanksgiving and Christmas . " Then the public temper , one of contentment , had not changed much since last sun I lc thought not . Were people concerned about the President 's health ? " Yes , they think he should take better cart of himself ' . People read about his going to the airport to meet this king , I think of Morocco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  they think he should let someone else do that . " Whitt did people think of Nixon ? " The trend is that they would n't have the confidence in him they have in Eisenhower , " Had Eisenhower lost popularity before Sputnik ? " 1 feel that he did , I believe that man is just what you call a downright good man all the way through , l think he may get persecuted , but 1 think goodness will prevail , that 's the way I feel about Eisenhower . 1 do hear quite a bit of comment that the continued rise of the cost of living is going to fall hack in our faces  --  hut those that say this have got plenty of money . The average person that works for wages , a good honest person trying to keep out of serious debt , is just looking forward to Saturday night and meeting his neighbors . Which I think is more healthy than making comments about how there 'll he a depression . If enough of us think about it , there 'll be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Bank , of which he is president , Philip Willkie , son of Wendell , was sitting in a rocking chair . looking out over the courthouse square . It was a gray . wintry day . snow clouds scudding above the courthouse spires , a few leaves swirling across the lawn . Willkie was a broad-faced , quick-moving , stocky man of thirty-eight . His office contained spindly furniture that had belonged to his gieatgrandfather , who had practiced law here . On a table was a suitcase plastered with steamship labels . Philip Willkie had been born in Rushville and in 1947 had come back here from New York to live . Sonic thought he had returned , as his father had , to establish a political base . He was elected three times to the Indiana Legislature . In 1954 he ran for judge and lost . He had been mentioned as a candidate to succeed Sen , William Jenner in 1958 . With his internationalist views and tendency toward " modern Republicanism , " he would provide a sharp contrast to Jenner. but Willkie said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the community . Some people disliked him  --  he was well-to-do and the son of a famous father , he was brusque , and , with his dark business suits and wide-ranging mind , he seemed , in a shirt-sleeved farm town , alien . Had Rushville changed much since the war ? Willkie , rocking by the window , said , " I think there 's been a tremendous change . Half the population commutes to jobs in industry . This used to he a retired-farmers ' town . Now it 's a suburban mill town . " He was overstating the case , but he had a point . " There is a profound economic change going on . We look over the management of the bank three years ago and we 've built a million-dollar consumer-credit department in the last two years  --  young couples buying refrigerators , vacuum cleaners , furniture , cars , That 's industrial-worker buying . " The Midwest was in the midst of a Treat economic boom , The SI . Lawrence Seaway would provide new thrust . Industrialization had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least here in Rushville , but it 's here . below the surface . Now , politically " ? he got up and walked rapidly around his desk ? " politically all the surface manifestations are very conservative , Foreign aid is basically unpopular . Yet I question whether there are n't some things under the surlace . These people have ita ? eled , I do n't say they 've become internationalist , but where ales ' ye been does rellee in their political viewpoint . I 'm not sold that the people here are as isolationist as the newspapers would have you believe . There 's a feeling of disinterest rather than an ' anti ' feeling . The same thing on domestic issues , There was a good deal of interest in I ink : Rock . This region talks pro-Southern , but treats the Negro as an equal . The only real prejudice I know of around here is against wealth and privilege . " The impact of the Ncw Deal and two World Wars has had a lasting effect . We had to empty the wastebasket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ envelopes from Government checks were so overflowing  --  Soil Bank , Social Security , pensions , and so on , " He paused . musing . " Now is a dead lime in politics . If you think back to the days when the Supreme Court packing plan was up , lend-lease , the old New Deal fights  --  there 's no interest now like there was then . And Sputnik  --  at first nobody was taking it seriously , But after a while they began to . " Were they concerned about the President 's health ? " I 've talked To a good many people , but I do n't feel that people are alarmed about it . 1 do n't think the people have got the idea yet that he might not be here for the rest of his term . " What do the local professional politicians say ? What issues are paramount today ? The Republican county chairman , Richard Phillips , slouched in an easy chair before a television set at home , said . " The state gross-income tax  --  it was raised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the Republican legislature passed it this year , and only God knows what the outcome will he . There are union men in every town these days , but the union ca n't deliver its vote . " What of national issues ? " ' Course , we 're very much isolationist here . We 're much against foreign aid . Dulles has never been too popular in our section of the country . I personally was for Bob Taft and would be still if he were alive . I 'd be for Herbert Hoover if he were still alive . " I He is. t " You 've got this war scare  --  the most that I hear is it 's got to the point where if Russia makes one more step , either we stop them or they stop us . The people were n't concerned about what you call Sputnik One , but after Sputnik Two , and after the scientists and military men brought out that we were behind , the people were more aware of the gravity of the situation . " Would people approve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go along with that , There 's a little less opposition to foreign aid than there used to be . ' Course . I 'm still an isolationist . " Did he hear talk of the H-bomb ? " It tics in with the weather . People are not worried about it . " His wile put in , " We just think it causes tornadoes and rain . " Phillips , a sporty-looking man with gray crew-cut hair , had been county clerk for eight years ; now his wife had the job . Had Eisenhower lost popularity ? " Yes . He 's a lame duck , Then Me international situation , the fear of war , and Russia 's outstripped us  --  there 's been a lot of indecision in Washington in the last few months . But he 's still popular with the public . " Was there any talk of his successor ? " Only since he was sick in November . " Who was favored to succeed him in 1960 ? " Right here the most popular would be Nixon . Among the fighting Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Knowland . " What of desegregation ? " You heard a lot about Little Rock at the time , both sides  --  that Eisenhower wits wrong and right for sending troops in . It hurt Eisenhower . I think it was a political move to keep the colored vote  --  which he 'll never keep . Right here it wo n't have any political effect at all . We always keep the Second Precinct " ? where Negroes live ? " in a presidential election . And the white Republicans here believe in State rights , but they believe in integration more . But I 'll tell you a new issue  --  people are scared to death of Wall Street , They just ca n't forget ' Twenty-nine . You lay off ten per cent of the workers in Indiana for three months , and that 's the end of the Republican Party . " Nowadays Phillips worked in Indianapolis for the state , a patronage job . " I do n't believe in Civil Service whatsoever . We used to have the police and lire and street department ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentive out of politics , " His sentiments were widely shared in Indiana . Last year the Democratic candidate for governor was quoted as promising that if after election he found a job which a Democrat could not fill , he 'd abolish it . Phillips said , " Right now it 's a low time in politics , no interest . If you want to really have a scramble , just let hog prices drop three or four dollars . Thai 's what hurts tit . " Times change . The I.Iks club was still the biggest social center in town , but old-fashioned celebrations on Memorial Day and Fourth of July had all but disappeared . The County Fair was still the biggest event of the year , but midget auto racing had replaced harness racing . The town 's social life revolved around the clubs , especially in the winter . One woman said , " There are about three hundred fifty organizations in this county  --  service clubs , church circles , farm clubs , everything . " Everybody was mobile . People thought nothing of driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How does it all look to an old-timer ? Chase Maury , seventy-five years old , born on a Rush County farm , was a small , white-haired . vigorous man sitting in the living room of his snug house on Main Street . He owned a 300-acre farm and ran a mortgage-and-insurance business in town . Could n't a man get by on eighty acres today if he was willing to go back to the horse-and-buggy days ? " You could n't make a living , " he said . " You 've got to have volume . I used to think if I had a thousand-dollar income it was a good living . Now it takes a thousand dollars a month to keep you going Overalls are four dollars . and they used to be fifty cents . You could n't take a horse and buggy to town today  --  you 'd get killed . Times have just gone apast us , It 's a different age , " and he bobbed his white head . " I 've had a good life . I had two daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Indianapolis . " We lost the older daughter . The other girl 's married and has two children . She 's a teacher here . Her husband and I operate the farm . He may quit soon . He 's a city hoy . I 'm seventy-five and I 'm going to quit it . I do n't want to go out and fool around that darn old farm . " His eyes twinkled  --  he did n't mean it . " I 'm in the insurance business and loan business . I have n't retired . Maybe I should , but  --  if you want to die , just quit . " His wife , who had been in the dining room , went upstairs . Watching her , he said , " I lost my wife four , use years ago . Married my sister-in-law . She 's a nice woman . She 's going to fly to Boston . Just think , she 'll leave Indianapolis at four and get to Boston at ten . " He was silent a moment . " Rushville 's been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around here , " and he named several proudly . " And we got some good lawyers , " and he named them too . " This land will go to a thousand dollars an acre in forty or fifty years . It 's getting in the hands of a few people . and people that 'll hold it , We 're eventually getting like England  --  the land 'll be in the hands of the older families . We used to just farm half-hazard , but you ca n't do that any more . It 's just like any other business . Some man'lt take a peanut roaster and get rich . And some man 'll do it and starve to death . It 's nearly all up to the individual , after all . " He was the only person in Rushville who volunteered this sentiment , once so common in Indiana and indeed in America . " I 'm kind of proud of this town . I do n't like Chicago . Chicago 's too big for me . New York 's worse , I was over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just exist . I 've been to California a couple of times . Going to New Orleans in October . Been to Florida , four , five times . I like Miami . But in two or three weeks I get all of it I want . I prefer the small town myself . It 's just where you grew up ; it 's what you like . "
