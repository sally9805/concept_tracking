A dynamite blast that geysered water of the Detroit River 150 ft. in the air signaled a new era in Great Lakes shipping last week . It set off a $23 million project that will deepen Amherstburg Channel in the Detroit River near Lake Erie to a minimum depth of 27 ft. ( from 21 ft. ) , enable the waterway to take deep-draft ocean-going ships of up to 10,000 tons and shallow-draft lake ships of 25,000 tons- almost double the present capacity . This is the first part of a five-year dredging program to open the upper Midwest to the globe-girdling ships that will use the new St. Lawrence Seaway . Said Army Secretary Wilber M. Brucker : " The final assault is being begun upon the barriers to the free flow of waterborne trade among the ports of the Great Lakes and those of the seven seas . " <P> Private contractors , working under the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers , will carve out a standard 27-ft. waterway in the 130 miles of channels linking the western Great Lakes . This week the Army will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deepening of a channel in the St. Mary 's River near the Soo Locks . Later , a work force of 800 to 1,000 will dredge the Straits of Mackinac channel between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron , deepen the channels in the St. Clair River , Lake St. Clair and the Detroit River . Total cost to the Federal Government : $136 million , more than has been spent on the Great Lakes connecting channels in the past 130 years . <P> Each inch of draft carved from connecting channels will permit large lake ships to carry about 100 more tons of cargo . This will bring bigger , faster , more modern ships onto the world 's busiest inland waterway , clip the Duluth-Cleveland voyage from seven days to five , cut lake shipping costs by 15 to 18 a ton , save shippers $10 million a year . It will also unlock the lakes for large-scale foreign trade . Some shippingmen predict that by 1965 Great Lakes-overseas traffic will go up tenfold , and the U.S. St. Lawrence Seaway Development Corp . optimistically forecasts that the seaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Help for Harbors . Readying for the surge in trade that will be generated by the deeper seaway and connecting channels , U.S. and Canadian lakeside ports are expected to spend about $50 million for improvement by the end of 1960 . Chicago alone is putting $24 million into its Lake Calumet Harbor Development , has already added a mile-long dock , two grain elevators ( total capacity : 13 million bu. ) , three modern cargo sheds ( capacity : 300,000 sq . ft. ) , ten miles of railroad and five miles of access roads . Milwaukee is investing $11.2 million . Among its projects : a $5,500,000 steel pier that will jut 1,020 ft. into Lake Michigan and a $1,300,000 pier in the outer harbor . Duluth , working with $10 million allotted by the Minnesota legislature , will build eleven slips for deep-draft ships , expects to spend $30 million in all by 1965 . Cleveland is budgeting $5,000,000 for new piers and the roadways and utilities that will serve them . But shippers complain that some lakeside ports are still in the doldrums .
