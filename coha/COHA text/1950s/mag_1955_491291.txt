MUST have been quite a card when I first won a job in baseball 's big leagues as a Boston Red Sox rookie in 1952 . I was a ripe subject for sports writers and col  --  umnists . I gagged up one thing after another , and almost everybody but the men on the field thought I was a riot . I made life miserable for the umpires with absurd and violent protests over routine decisions . I plagued Lou Boudreau , the Red Sox manager at that time , for chances to play every day , and on the days he kept me on the bench I stormed and screamed , and once even cried like a baby . I mocked my teammates and got into fist fights with friends and foes alike . The puz.zled Red Sox people could n't figure out how to calm me down . They liked the way I played ball , but not the way I behaved . Finally , in desperation , they sent me to their Sout hero Association farm club at Birmingham , Alabama , where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't help . During the twenty days I played there , I acted up so badly that I was suspended four times . After the fourth ban  --  ishment , I flew back to Boston on my own and checked in with the Red Sox . By this time , they W ' o PARTS realized I was sick , and , with my consent , they sent me to a private sanitarium for observation . I went berserk as soon as I got there , and ended up in a mental institution , The odd thing about all these antics is that I do n't remember any of them . From the moment I walked into the lobby of the Sarasota Terrace Hotel in Sarasota , Florida , to report to the Red Sox special training camp on the morning of Jan  --  uary 15 , 1952 , until the moment I came to my senses in the violent room of the Westborough State Hospital in Massachusetts the following August , my memory is almost an absolute blank . I do have a clear recollection of the birth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , outside of that , there are only a few hazy impressions . It was as if seven mont he had been cropped right out of my life . But 1 pulled out of it . I was sound and healthy by the spring of 1953 . Baseball men and sports writers alike began calling me the finest fielding outfielder in the business that year , and I was named the outstanding sophomore ballplayer in the American League . Today I face the future with confidence , for I know that I have recovered 17 completely , just as if I had recovered completely from pneumonia or chicken pox or a broken leg . It is for this reason that I am telling my story . I want the world to know that people like me , who have returned from the half-world of mental obliv  --  ion , are not forever contaminated . We have been sick . The best way to help us get well and stay well is to treat us like human beings ? as I 've been treated . There is no better therapy than under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for which I thank God every day of my life . But in order that I and others like me may be fully under  --  stood , I must tell my story from the beginning , for the source of my sickness goes back far beyond the day I blacked out in Sarasota . I was horn in Waterbury , Connecticut , on No  --  vember 14 , 1929 . My father was a house painter . I had a much older brother , but he died when I was young , so I was brought up as an only child . We were an ordinary working-class family , neither rich nor poor . We lived in the second-floor-rear apart  --  ment at 683 East . Main Street . Not far away was the parochial school where I got my primary edu  --  cation , and the Catholic church where I received my spiritual training . One of my first memories is playing catch with my father in the big yard in back of our home . He was a semipro ballplayer , a frustrated professional . He was determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began grooming me as soon as I was old enough to hold a ball in my hand . He allowed me to do only that which would be helpful to me as a ballplayer . I could play basketball because it was a good , safe body builder , and beneficial in the development of the quick reactions needed for baseball . I could run on the track team if I liked , for running is a basic requirement in baseball . But I was forbidden to play football , for that is a contact game in which I might get hurt and he ruined for baseball . My father gave me long talks on the evils of drinking , smoking and gambling . Any of the three could hurt me for baseball , I have abstained from them all to this day . My father was the big influence of my early life . 14e had to be . My mother was sick  --  desperately sick ? during the ten years that began when I was seven years old . My whole boyhood was blighted by her illness . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was preparing supper when I got home in the evening , it would n't be necessary for us to exchange a word . I knew that meant my mother had gone away again . " Gone away " was a vague term which , to me , meant only that she was not in the house for months at a time . For a long while I had no idea what was wrong with her . Later I learned that she suffered from a mental condition which made it necessary for her to go to a sanitarium from time to time . When mho was away , I worried over how long she 'd be gone . When she was home , I worried over the pos  --  sibility of her having to go away again . I was a worrier by nature . I worried about my schoolwork , and about my friends ' liking me , and about what we were going to have for dinner , and about whether or not I 'd ever be big enough to play major-league baseball . I worried just as much about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what might happen in two hours . As long as r can remember , I always had a fear of the unknown . Every year , when it was time for me to move from one grade in school to the next , I was afraid to face the change . I was afraid to travel , to meet new people , to try new foods . Only while I was taking part in sports , particularly baseball and basketball , did I feel mentally relaxed . A Bundle of Nerves and Excess Energy B Y the time I entered Leavenworth High School in 1943 , just short of my fourteenth birthday , I was a little bundle of nerves and excess energy . It was impossible for me to slay still long enough to read a book or sit through a movie . No matter what I did or how exhausted I became doing it , I bad to keep going . I might run dry physically , but my nerves kept pushing me to do more . I drew on every ounce of reserve every day . Bill Tracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , tried to slow me down , but it was an impossible job . He finally gave me my head on the basketball court and the baseball diamond , and during the football season he let me hold the first-down stakes so I could be close to the action . No matter what I did , no matter what sport was involved , I was always shrieking at the top of my lungs . Day after day , I came home hoarse from the howling . It was particularly bad during the base  --  ball season . I was the center fielder , so I had a long way to yell . I tried to run everything from out there . I yelled to the other fielders where to play hitters , and I yelled to the pitcher what to throw , and I yelled to the umpire what to call . I was pretty ob  --  noxious , but I could n't help myself . The kids who understood me were my friends . The kids who did n't disliked me i ' tensely . From my sophomore year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . It took hours for me to fall asleepbut when I succeeded , I slept soundly enough . Every morning I bounced out of bed , eager to get back on the merry-go-round . No matter how much of my  --  self I had squeezed out one day , I always seemed to have a rich new supply to squeeze out the next . Sometime around my junior year in high school I began to get headaches . They came periodically at first . I thought it was my sinus . Then I noticed the headaches were worse after I had given my throat an unusually rough workout . As they became more frequent , I began telling myself not to yell so much , because I figured the screaming was causing the trouble . I 'd try to quiet down , but it was hopeless . I came to accept the headaches as part of my daily existence . I did n't dare mention them to any  --  one , because I was afraid it would mean I would have to rest . If I rested I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . So I suffered the head  --  aches in silence . They stayed with me right up to the time I lost touch with the world in 1952 . I have n't had one since my recovery . Yet even with the headaches , I was happy in high school . Most of all , I was happy because I was a po  --  tential big-league ballplayer . Scouts began asking Bill Tracy about me when 1 was fifteen years old , and it was n't long before they were sounding out my father . He was coy with everyone , partly because it was good business to be coy and partly because I had a chance for a scholarship at Duke University . There I could play for Jack Coombs , the old Phila  --  delphia Athletics pitcher and one of the smartest college baseball coaches . My father thought it would be a good thing for me to go to college first , since I was scheduled to graduate from high school at the tender age of seventeen . But those plans went out the window in March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the EVENING PIM ' THEY CALLED ME CRAZY-AND I WAS ! and stayed in shape by refereeing bas  --  ketball games a few nights no week . But t he compulsion to keep moving all the time was somewhat less intense . As the time for spring training ap  --  proached , f began getting jumpy again . The old fear of the unknown was still with me . My instructions were to report In the Red Sox 's Louisville farm club , which was training Hi Bradenton , Florida . The prospect pre  --  sented me with a whole new set of worries . Suppose I did n't make the grade ? How could I face my parents and my friends ? And how should I act in Bradenton ? How should I dress ? What should I say to the newspapermen ? How should I react to the other guys ? Should I call the coaches by their first names or should I call them - Mister " ? And what if they overlooked me ? How could I attract attention ? That seemed more important than any  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many youngsters in the Bradenton training camp . Some must be at least as good as 1 , and what if most were better ? What if I ended up way down with some Class C or D club ? What if I could n't even qualify for that ? By the time 1 arrived at . Bradenton in March of 1948 , I was taut and nerv  --  ous and scared . But two things tended to relax me the first day I was in camp . One was the sight of the other rookies , most of whom looked just as nervous . The other was my success at the plate the first time I stepped into the hat  --  ter 's box . I hit a pitch over the center fielder 's head , a long belt which every  --  body in the hall park noticed . After that , I was all right . As the days progressed , the coaches gave me more and more attention . They did n't have to work on my fielding . I was a natural ball hawk . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was green as grass . Eventually , I was sent to another Red Sox farm-club base at Cocoa , Flor  --  ida , where I was assigned to the Scran  --  ton club in the Class A Eastern League . 1 was satisfied , for most of the other boys went to clubs in leagues of lower classificat ion . I had a good year at Scranton , where my manager was Mike Ryba , now a St. Louis Cardinals ' coach . He was a friendly , easygoing man with many years of baseball experience behind him , and he was good to me . I was happy during that 1948 season in Scranton . Most important of all , I was happy because I met Mary Teevan , the first and only girt who ever inter  --  ested me . Mary was not only attractive but she seemed to have an instinctive understanding of the complexities of my nature . She was my kind of per  --  son  --  a member of my faith , a child of working-class parents , a product of a medium-sized city . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she listened , the more I talked . I had never before had anyone in whom I could confide so completely . Just talking to her helped me unwind . Before the season was over , we were discussing the futufe , and we had an understanding by the lime I left for home . I went hack to work for the silver company in Meriden during the winter of 1948-49 , but just , to make sure that Mary would n't forget me , I bought a secondhand car and commuted 1w Iween Waterbury and Scranton every other weekend . I would stay there un  --  til Sunday evening , then drive all night LO Meriden and get into the plant . on Monday morning without any sleep . It was not a recommended routine for a boy suffering from nervous tension , but , oddly enough , I was more relaxed that winter than I ever thought . I could be without baseball . I spent the next two seasons with h the Louisville Colonels , the highest-rank  --  mg Red Sox farm club . Ryba was pro  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a couple of times dur  --  ing the 1949 season , arid we were mar  --  ried in Scranton on October twenty-second of that year . We moved in with my folks , and I went back to work at the silver plant again . We were happy , and the future looked wonderful . But it turned out to he a tough winter . A month before I went to spring training , Mary had a miscarriage . For a few days she was so sick that I was afraid I would lose her . She recovered in time to go to Braden  --  ton with me in 1950 , and we had a good spring , but right in the middle of the season , she got terribly sick again in Louisville . By this time I was so upset that I developed some kind of stomach ail  --  ment . I rode out a storm of stomach miseries until Mary was well again . It helped when the Red Sox called me up in September for a closer look at me . I spent most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a pleasant frame of mind . " Next year , " I told Mary , " we 'll be up here for good . " We were expecting a baby when I left to report to the Red Sox in 1951 . I was deeply concerned . But I did n't have to wait long for good news . Our first child , Eileen , was horn on March fifth . Relieved of that worry , I concen  --  trated on trying to make the hall club . The expanse of outfield is tremen  --  dous at . Payne Field , where the Red Sox trained , and I must have covered about three quarters of it going after fly halls . Dominic DiMaggio , after watching me for a few days , came over one day and said , " Kid , you 're the best center fielder in the American League right now . " I I banked him and strutted off , glow  --  ing all over with pride . The man I most admired as a fielder , the man beside whom I had wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid me the supreme compliment ! What more could I ask ? Plenty , as it turned out . Steve O'Neill , the Red Sox manager , was looking for power , not finesse . He was impressed with my fielding , but not with my hitting . I was always a slow starter at the plate , and that year was no exception . I went to Boston , but had no chance to play . After sitting on the Red Sox bench for a week , I asked O'Neill to farm me out . I preferred playing in the minors to riding the bench in the majors . Back in Louisville , the situation had changed . They , too , were looking for strength at the plate , not grace in the outfield . I found myself fighting for a minor-league job that I had easily won before . I hatted .310 in the first seven  --  teen games of the season , and thought I was doing all right , but I was taken out of the tine-up and Karl Olson was put in my place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby , and that meant new obliga  --  tions . I could n't manage much longer on a minor-league salary . But how could I move up to the top from the Louisville bench ? I went to Ed Doherty , the president of the Louisville club , who had always treated me well . I asked to be sent where I could play every day . Doherty arranged for me to go to the Birmingham Barons . The Southern Association is Class AA , one grade be ( Continued on Page - 16 ) It THE SATURI ) %1 ' EVEN INC ( Cantina I Page 42 ) low t he American Association , but raat enough so that a man can jump di  --  rectly from there to the majors . Red Marion was the Birmingham manager , and he put me right into action . I hit the ball so hard that I nearly won the league batting championship with a .346 average , finishing second behind Babe Barna , of Nashville . I belted fifteen home runs and drove in eighty-three runs . My work in the out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  sists , and might have had more if opposing base runners had not stopped taking chances on my throwing arm . In August , Johnny Murphy , the Red Sox farm director , dropped around and watched is few games . He pulled me aside one day and said , " You handle ground halls well , and you 've got a good arm . Why do n't you fool around in the infield a little before games ? " The suggestion made no particular impression on me . I knew that a good many outfielders improved their han  --  dling of ground halls by working with the infielders during practice , and I thought that was why Murphy wanted me to do it . The Barons finished second , and then we won both I he Southern Asso  --  ciation playoffs and the Dixie Series . I was sitting on top of the world . But back in Scranton , where we lived that next winter with Mary 's family , since my parents did n't have room for all three of us in Waterbury , I was faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Red Sox would pay me $6000 if I made the cluh , and I would need every cent of it to support my parents and my family , particularly since we were expecting our second baby in the spring . In other years I had been able to supplement my earnings with the win  --  ter job in Meriden . But now we were n't living near Meriden , and I could n't find a job in Scranton , although I hunted high and low . As the days went by and it became more and more obvi  --  ous that I was n't going to make con  --  nections , I began to get panicky . With nothing to do , I started mop  --  ing around the house . I knew I could n't keep that up , so I began going to the Scranton Catholic Youth Center gym  --  nasium to work out . That helped , be  --  cause it gave me a place to go every day , and it kept me in shape . I man  --  aged to work off some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  pletely dwarfed everything else . I was idly leafing through the December twelfth issue of The Sporting News , baseball 's bible , looking for the weekly dispatch about the Red Sox . It proved to be a discussion of Vern Stephens , the club 's shortstop , who had been hav  --  ing trouble with his hip . I was inter  --  ested only because everything about the Red Sox interested me . But sud  --  denly my own name seemed to leap up from the printed page and crack me right across the face . This is what I read : One planned move is the converting of Jimmy Piersatt. minor-league outfield sensa  --  tion with Birmingham last season . into a shortstop . Pierson will be the chief target of the Red Sox brass at the special training camp which opens in Sarasota , January 15 . I stared , unbelieving , and then made myself read on : " We may be able to turn him into a top  --  notch shortstop. " manager Boudreau said . " The kid has great natural instinct on ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special training session . The manager him  --  self will decide whether the youngster has a future at shortstop . " If he does . " Boudreau said . - farm him out a year . I 'd never take him up as a short  --  stop right off . " It was impossible ! I was n't a short  --  stop . I was an outfielder . They could n't be planning to shift me now ! Why , it could ruin me . Ruin me ? Maybe that 's what they intended . They knew I could n't be a big-league shortstop . Had n't Boudreau said that he would farm me out a year if I looked as if I could make it ? That meant I was damned if I did and damned if I did n't . If I looked good as a shortstop , I 'd go to the minors . If I looked bad , I 'd go to the minors any  --  way . Why , the Red Sox did n't want me at all . " They 're trying to get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over . " This is a brush-off . Well , I 'll fool ' em . I wo n't show up for their lousy special training camp . " And over and over , she argued , " It 's not a brush-off . It 's a compliment . Shortstop 's one of the toughest posi  --  tions on the ball club . " But I refused to he convinced . As the days went by and the inner turmoil increased in intensity , I drew further and further away from reality . I could n't face people . I was a pariah , a failure , neither sought after nor wanted , and everyone knew I was n't wanted . I ducked into alleys , walked across streets , stepped into doorways or even detoured around city blocks to avoid meeting people I knew . I stopped going to the gym and be  --  gan haunting the movie houses . Each
