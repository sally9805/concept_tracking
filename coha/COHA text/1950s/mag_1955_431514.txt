THERE is a great deal of talk these days about the irrationality of modern man . Some tell us it proves that the Old Adam , who was apparently a lunatic , has revolted against the strain of being civilized . Others blame it on centuries of bad toilet training , whose consequences are suddenly catching up with us . " We are entering , " Dr. Robert Lindner has recently concluded , " an era that will be dominated by primitive emotional appeals . " He went on to suggest that psychiatry might help postpone this fate , but the A'ezr York Times headlined his remarks : " Dark Ages Near , Society Warned . " Whatever the diagnosis , there seems to be a general agreement that modern man is suffering from some sort of mass softening of the brain . I wish to enter a dissent . I do n't think we are so crazy . It seems to me that on a simple quantitative basis the amount of rationality in the world far outweighs the irrationality . Taking everything into account , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crops are harvested , the mails delivered , and income taxes paid ; they are . even computed . In the course of their daily jobs , traffic cops , telephone operators , garage mechanics , bank tellers , and sales people solve problems of a fair degree of complexity . And most of us not only get through our daily jobs but bring up and educate our children , stay only moderately in the red , and manage to keep out of jail while doing so . All of these activities require ingenuity , foresight , imagination , the ability to derive conclusions logically from premises , the capacity to distinguish fact from fantasy , and , most of all , a sense of proportion . When we consider the wars , depressions , inflated currencies , and deflated egos in which our society has recently been specializing , the remarkable fact is not the increase in the number of neuroses but their comparative mildness . The relative balance most men and women have managed to keep in their personal affairs ( luring these last lunatic decades is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all , I think it can be said that we are not doing so badly . A N D IT should be said . For , while it seems depressing to say that we are all crazy , it is really a consoling and lazy-making notion . It is plain , of course , that we do live in a period that may fairly be called an age of unreason . And the notion that this collective unreason goes back to the illness of individuals , that it is mainly a medical problem , saves us from thinking about the difficult and risky communal choices that we really have to make if we are going to deal with unreason in any large-scale way . Where does the irrationality around us show itself ? It shows in the statistics ? or what may merely be more accurate statistics ? of personal neurosis , of juvenile delinquency , of drug addiction . But it shows itself most plainly in our large-scale impersonal activities . Increasingly these have come to seem the special province of emotions we used to find only in tales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in had melodrama ? hysteria , tears out of proportion to their ostensible causes , obsessions with some one issue at the expense of all others , and an obvious growing inability to draw the line between the probable and the improbable . We seem to live in an age when people who can not be carried away by anything in their personal lives are transported out of themselves by public affairs . If Emily Bronte were to write Wuthering Heights today , Heathcliff would have to have been disappointed in politics to make his emotional state  | seem plausible . And if Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde were a contemporary novel , Mr. Hyde would turn out to be a courier for a spy ring . There have been periods before ? for example , in the Middle Ages ? when lunacy ran through communities like a plague and men and women went collectively berserk . But the symptoms of our modern bouts of collective insanity are not the same . In these earlier periods individuals fell in trances , or spoke gibberish , or had fits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite . Men who fall into trances make threehour speeches ; those who speak gibberish get it printed in the newspapers , where it looks like grammatical ? or almost grammatical ? English ; and those who have fits have them on television . The men who participate in modern organized madness are not individually insane in a medical or legal sense . Those who take part in race riots in Illinois or California go home and pick up their lives , and five minutes afterwards can not he distinguished from anybody else . Their unreason is limited to certain public and political things , and in their own personal lives they may be no more irresponsible than the rest of us . COMFORTABLE AND FAMILIAR THE GREAT problem today is how so much public insanity can come from so much private sanity . Why do the sobriety and competence which so many exhibit in their individual workaday lives ? the housewife who plans her meals like a trained dietitian , the baseball fan who uses statistics so expertly in making predictions ? why do such traits not show themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If collective irrationality does not come from unbalanced individuals , where does it come from ? It comes , I think , from something in the way our lives are socially organized . In the course of their daily round most people work out a set of precepts and rules , expectations of what is normal , and techniques for doing what they want to do , which go by the name of " common sense . " This common sense is the distillation of ordinary experience . It is frequently vague and inarticulate ; it is sometimes inconsistent . But as a vehicle for getting men and women through the daily run of things , from their homes to their jobs to their personal relations , it is their main support in life . It is comfortable , it can be used almost intuitively , and so long as it stays in the area for which it was built it fits most needs . Common sense , moreover , is not just a collection of cold ideas . It carries with it all the comfort of the familiar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and native idiom . It is associated with most of the things that are intimate and precious ? with our earliest memories , with our habitual routines , with our most permanent commitments . As a result , we do not like to give it up . We prefer to use it even when it does not fit . Y E T there is now a gap between the ordinary experience of ordinary people in their daily lives and the events that break in on them from the outside world of government and international affairs . And this gap has become steadily harder to bridge . The ordinary rules and judgments by which we get around successfully in our private lives just do n't apply to public events . And when common sense leaves us in the lurch , we find ourselves without intellectual defenses , fusing fantasy with fact , and confusing the impossible with the possible . We fall back on ways of thinking we would effortlessly reject when we are fixing a car or buying a house or playing bridge ? on animistic styles of thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in occult forces or in superhuman human beings . Many men and women , for example , have tried to interpret the Communist revolution in China in the terms they would employ to explain a fire in the basement : they look for carelessness or criminal negligence or blame it on a few incendiaries . Such analogies with the small-scale events of daily life are not wholly misleading . If they were they might not do so much damage , for fewer people would believe them . But they are just misleading enough . And when they are acted on they can give the outsider ( if he operates on different assumptions ) the impression of watching moonstruck men moving about in a world of their own imagination . An increasing number of people in Europe , for this reason , are thoroughly perplexed by the American emphasis on internal subversion ; they seem to have concluded that we are all off our rockers . What leads to this impression , of course , is the obvious fact that we are the richest country in the world , with the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow-travelers per capita than any other nation . Here again , it is the radical dissimilarity of public events with the ordinary round of men 's  | experience which discourages us from using what common sense we have . Our present obsession with the danger of internal Communists has not happened in spite of the fact that we have so few Communists . It has happened precisely because of that fact . We do not take Communists in stride as Europeans do because , in America , they are strange , unknown people who are clearly cut off from the mainstream of national life . The average Frenchman is likely to know at least one Communist personally ; and most Frenchmen , as a result , have been able to judge from direct contact just how dull of intellect , boring in manner , and clumsy in action the normal run of Communists are . We , on the other hand , do not have the Frenchman 's advantages . And so we continue to treat Communists as men apart , whose qualities elude the categories we normally apply in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Communists supernatural powers to undermine our lives . We are not crazy . But on this issue we act crazy . SENSE , COMMON AND OTHERWISE THERE are a number of reasons why the gap between public and private reason is so hard to bridge . The first is the simple difficulty of getting reliable information . Common sense , after all , can not work in the void . It has to start from what it can take to be facts . A free press , offering a multiplicity of views and opinions , is vastly preferable to a controlled press that offers only one . But unfortunately , competing misinterpretations do not always cancel one another out , leaving the bare facts bathed in a pure white light for all to see . Ten small lies may be preferable to One Big Lie , but they are not exactly the royal road to truth . And a good many people have the common sense to see this . Of course , there are newspapers , commentators , and other agencies of information in countries like Britain and America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obtained . But in all too many circumstances a man of common sense is still justified in deciding simply not to believe anything he hears . And even when he thinks he can believe what he hears , it is still possible for this information to leave him cold . He may find it impossible to exercise his common sense upon it . What in the experience of most of us , for example , prepares us to appraise the significance of new proposals for the international control of currencies ? A man 's common sense is checked and chastened , and it grows in flexibility and wisdom , when he can see results directly , and measure them against his expectations . But today the private individual is often far removed from the consequences of his public actions . He does not know what these consequences are , or he does not have to pay attention to them . They are diluted and lost by distance . A businessman who lobbies for a tariff will never see , or he will not know that he sees , the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make war on his account . Much of what goes by the name of wickedness in the world is not wickedness at all , but the result of the fact that the " criminal " is so far removed from the scene of his " crime . " There is a deeper reason for unreason , therefore , in the increasing specialization of modern societies . When Aristotle , in his Politics , analyzed the natural history of politics , he moved by easy stages from the problems of domestic economy through the problems of the village to the problems of the city-state . The assumption was that the same language , the same general style of reasoning , and the same fundamental community of experience persisted as men moved from their private domains to public ones . It is plain that some such assumption has been at the basis of most theories of liberal and democratic government . The relevance of common sense to public problems ; the possibility of checking the narrowness of expert knowledge against the wider experience of ordinary men ; the existence of some basic community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions on which vigorous democratic politics have usually been thought to depend . B U T to an increasing extent men and women of all classes are now involved in exacting technical routines which absorb their energies and shut them in behind a set of exclusive experiences and habits . On the one hand , specialization insulates the ordinary man 's experience from the experience of other ordinary men . On the other , it makes his private knowledge and practical abilities increasingly irrelevant to public problems . We are now getting less and less of what might be called " common common sense , " and more and more different kinds of common sense that are barely on speaking terms with one another . So we look back wistfully on the superior  | political wisdom of the Founding Fathers , forgetting that their national politics were in fact a fairly short extension of their domestic affairs . A Jefferson or a Franklin was required to know less about his specialized interests because , quite simply , there was so much less to be known ; as a result , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things . Even more important , the decisions the Fathers made , and the issues involved , could in some sense be judged by the other educated men of their day . In contrast , we today have innumerable men who are distinguished specialists in their own fields ? physical scientists , industrial engineers , military men ? who suddenly find themselves pushed to the center of public life , where they are called upon to make decisions involving ultimate public issues which hitherto have appeared only on the hazy and remote horizons of their lives . A MATTER OF MORALS TO S A Y that contemporary irrationality is thus a by-product of the way our world has changed since the Enlightenment may sound discouraging ; for , obviously , we could not hope to restore in usable form the conditions of the eighteenth century , even if we wanted to . But to assume that our troubles arise from individual instability would be even more discouraging . There is at least a mildly cheerful note , it seems to me , in concluding that our current bouts with irrationality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning power of the individual human animal . Our lunacies are not personal but political ? political in context , political in language , political in origin . And they therefore offer the possibility of political solution , of dealing with them on the large scale that their ubiquity and urgency require . What we seek is not the nostalgic restoration of some " lost " sense of innocence and order which , retrospectively , the Founding Fathers seem to have enjoyed . What we need is to achieve , in our own terms , the equivalent of something they did indeed possess ? which was a public intelligence , the kind of shared reaction to common experiences which enables the community to respond relevantly to its problems , or ? more simply ? to extend its private common sense to its public affairs . In this the Fathers had the advantage of us , it is true , in having a set of formal and somewhat arbitrary moral rules and hierarchies at their command . Achieving their kind of public intelligence is today attended with numerous difficulties , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of remembering that it has never been wholly easy , in any time or place . For , at the political level , a particularly sharp and bewildering divergence must always take place between the private and public intelligence . It arises over the question of morality . The morals of common sense are personal morals . They are relevant to the sort of smallscale , face-to-face actions whose unintended or unknown consequences are limited , and in which , as a result , a man 's conscious intention ? his good or ill will ? is of crucial importance . Common-sense morality grows out of circumstances in which individuals can be treated with due regard to the differences between them , can have exceptions made in their favor , and can be held personally responsible for what takes place . Since it is grounded in the particular , commonsense morality can deal with good and evil without becoming lost in abstractions . It can deal , above all , with motives . But the direct application of common-sense morality to public affairs has disastrous results . When one must deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which no man can clearly foresee the end , then it is no longer appropriate to apply the simple , categorical value judgments of daily private life . To be preoccupied with motives , or to insist on attributing ideological purity and civic virtue to only one political faction , is fatal alike to the practicing politician and the observing citizen . Public affairs can be neither conducted nor understood in terms of individual moral intentions . In fact , if any single factor can be said to have poisoned the wellsprings of the American political intelligence , it has been this kind of misapplied and at times extravagantly single-minded concern with motives .  | The same disability attends the rules and standards of personal morality when they are employed in international politics , They not only fail to apply , but the attempt to force-fit them may produce unintentionally immoral effects . We do not ordinarily go around stealing our neighbors ' mail . But this is standard operating procedure , and long accepted as such , in international diplomacy . One can not make diplomacy better merely by asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only useless to appeal to the better nature of diplomats ; it is irrelevant . Of course , to say that human ideals have nothing to do with politics would be false in fact and misguided in principle . Communities in which political action takes place hold certain moral views , and when government diverges too widely from these views it contributes to a general moral breakdown . But , though the final test of public conduct is the difference it makes in the private lives of individuals , this does not mean that the behavior of nations can be interpreted by the principles we apply to individual conduct , or controlled by attempts at moral persuasion . A man who tries to do so today , when politics have become large-scale and impersonal , is apt to end with the empty feeling that the world he lives in is morally absurd . His common sense may all too easily evaporate into empty platitudes about the need for moral regeneration , or ( and sometimes in addition ) lead him to endorse a cynical and supposedly " realistic " separation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public intelligence is therefore a problem mainly of confidence and appropriateness . We possess , as a collection of individuals , more common sense than we seem able to draw on as a group . The enlarging of our private intelligence to a publicly meaningful . size , in any traditional way , is obstructed by the unique extent and variety of the group we compose . Our loss of confidence in common sense is in good part the outcome of misapplying it , or asking of it functions it can not satisfy . Where the application is suited to the situation , we have every proof that individual common sense can be widely and successfully brought to bear . Again and again in recent years ? on the battlefield , to choose familiar examples , or in temporary housing developments since the war ? quite ordinary people have demonstrated under the pressure of common emergencies the degree to which they can take charge of their own affairs , develop publicly useful skills , and act with sober independence and imagination . But these reserves of reasoning power and co-operative ingenuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose to act , they could make a difference . We would have much to gain if such situations turned up , not simply in an emergency , but in the normal course of events . There is , in short , a germ of truth in the old notion that only those with property should vote , because they alone will vote responsibly . What is wrong with it is only the narrowness of the notion of " property . " If we think of " property " as the concrete interests over which an individual has real power , and of increasing the ways in which such " property " can be more broadly diffused , we might recover a responsible and politically oriented common sense . Tocqueville 's recommendation for making large-scale democracy work is still sound : public decisions reached by consultation at the local level and enforced by local agencies with real powers . This is what the TVA tried to do twenty years ago , and it succeeded in tapping the human , as well as the natural , resources of a depressed area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it suggests the direction in which we should turn . The " problem " of political irrationality invites us to seek many such " solutions , " and to look more discerningly for communal rationality in-the-large from sources we may hitherto have thought too small . But whatever approach we take , one thing is plain . There are no justifications for the current adventures in wholesale despair ? for loss of faith in democracy , for snobbishness about the " common man , " or for the increasingly fashionable notion that belief in rational methods of social conduct rests on an excessively optimistic view of human nature . The problem of why we are crazy is a political problem ? a problem of re-arranging the ways in which social power is now exercised . It needs the social inventiveness , the willingness to make choices , and the courage to take the risks that go with imaginative action . It does not need medicine , magic , or moonshine about the end of Rational Man . Perhaps if we spent less time in being fascinated by the spectacle of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use ? and could clearly better use ? the common sense we have , we might find that there is still plenty of reason to believe in human reason .  |
