 | HENRY J. BRUCE , a British naval diver , met his octopus off Gibraltar . Forty feet down , he stooped to pick up a pair of overalls on the bottom . The overalls rose and danced . When octopus arms thrust out and the suckers gripped him , Bruce was terrified . But not too terrified to forget his knife . It worked . A stroke between the eyes -- the standard thrust prescribed for divers ? destroyed the animal 's brain . The tentacles relaxed . So did Bruce ? after he had himself hauled up . Bruce 's story is typical . It shows what happens almost every time a man encounters an octopus : ? The octopus scares the daylights out of him . ? The man is almost always unscathed . A streetcar full of passengers once met an octopus ? right in the car . The car was on a supposedly quiet run , in one of Britain 's Channel Island towns , when the cephalopod was spotted . He was taking a seat in the car . What was worse , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap of a passenger . The passenger screamed and dissolved into hysteria . One man aboard was not terrified . Dr. Alan Stephenson , a marine zoologist , owned the octopus . He had been carrying it in a wicker basket . He retrieved the animal and laid it back inside . Fear of the octopus is needless . That is the unanimous conclusion today of teuthologists ( octopus scientists ) . " In my opinion , they 're virtually harmless , " says Kenneth Norris , curator of Marineland of the Pacific . " I do n't know of an authentic case of a man killed by an octopus , " James W. Atz , associate curator of New York City 's new aquarium told me . There you have it : In spite of everything you 've heard or read , there has never been a single proven instance of an octopus killing a man . Atz has one word he says describes the cephalopod best : timid . Why , if the octopus is the world 's biggest false alarm , does it cling to its position as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berrill of McGill University , Montreal , believes one reason is that it looks like a nest full of snakes . " Snake shape , " he says . " Men are allergic to that shape . " Then there 's another reason for octopus scares , Berrill explains : " Tall tales . Tall tales that are mostly untrue . " In 1866 the tallest and most untrue tale of all gave the modern world its concept of the octopus . Victor Hugo , in a novel , drew on his vivid imagination rather than on scientific facts : " No horror can equal the sudden apparition of the devilfish , that Medusa with its eight serpents . " " A glutinous mass endowed with a malignant will . " And so on , for 20 pages . Hugo 's book , Toilers of the Sea , was a smash hit . Thousands read it . Famous French restaurants served with special sauces the creature that Hugo had described as " a monstrous embodiment of disease " with " gangrened and scabrous flesh . " Paris milliners created an octopus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing replicas of the creature Hugo called slimy and loathsome . Hugo won some praise from teuthologists because , by his Frankenstein prose , he did something no other man has ever done . He made the octopus popular . But  | l teuthologists , who today are working to restore the octopus ' popularity , had second thoughts about Hugo when they realized how untrue his tall tales were . " He who writes these lines , has seen with his own eyes at Sark ( in the Channel Islands ) an octopus swimming and pursuing a bather , " Hugo wrote . If Hugo saw that , teuthologists say , he is the only man who ever did . " This is the most obvious misconception , " says Kenneth Norris of Marineland . " They 're very retiring , shy creatures . For a swimmer , the danger of being attacked by an octopus in American waters , on any coast , is about as great as the danger of being blown up by an exploding pumpkin in a cornfield . " An expert 's testimony . Norris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) trips a year around California coastal islands , sometimes skin-diving , would give anything if only the octopuses would come after him . Instead , they run away into @# crevices in rocks or in shell beds or in burrows on the sea floor . They are extremely clever at hiding : They often build their own homes by moving and stacking rocks and shells and excavating the sea bed by means of their ability to jet water . Then they go inside and close the door by hauling a rock or shell after them . If they ca n't take shelter , they hide by changing to any of an incredible spectrum 84 POPULAR SCIENCE of colors to match almost anything around ? yellow , brown , white , maroon . gray , pink , striped or dotted ? even blue . green or transparent to blend with the water . In extreme cases , they squirt their ink . Brown or purple , it hangs briefly in the water in the startling silhouette of an octopus to let the real quarry escape . As the octopus usually eludes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . He lowers to the bottom an octopus doghouse . This is a cave-like coffin with an opening that . he hopes , an octopus will climb into . If one does , he has difficulty , on the deck of his boat , in getting the timid creature out . It usually wo n't come voluntarily . Norris tosses in a starfish . The starfish has claws on its back , and pinches the cephalopod . which then emerges . Norris puts the octopus in a tank of iced sea water for the short trip to the Marineland aquarium . Octopuses are escapists . Even after capture , they keep running away from men . For 30 years , this habit of theirs has plagued Christopher W. Coates , head of the New York City aquarium . The octopus that rode the street car shows one way they do it . Possessing no skull and no bones , an octopus is almost all muscle and flesh . He has an incredible ability : He can flatten himself almost to the thinness of a sheet of paper and slither through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus had oozed out of the wicker basket under the tightly closed top . Coates has had octopuses escape from nailed-shut cigar boxes and from cages of A-inch wire mesh . In tanks , aboard ship , he had something else happen : They got seasick . Like you , an octopus when seasick wants to die . Unlike you , the cephalopod often does . They 're hard to fool , too . Even in the aquarium tanks , Coates 's timid octopuses continued to hide ? this time from the public either in the rocks in their tanks , or by protective coloration . People saw the sign " octopus " and nothing else . Coates received protests . He knew octopuses , nocturnal , normally are active only at night . To get them to move instead by day , when the crowds were on hand , he darkened their tanks , left on @#  | only a blue light . This did not fool a single octopus . Like the critter aboard the streetcar climbing into a lap , and like all octopuses , Coates 's began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swim with ease . In New York City they climbed right out of their aquarium tanks into the nearby bay . Thinking he had none left , Coates drained the tanks . He found six , beneath some coral . They had hidden ? even from him . Octopuses prefer sea food . Victor Hugo said the octopus drank human blood and ate human flesh . This is plain nonsense . What the octopus eats is mostly crabs . It also consumes fish , crustaceans , worms , scallops , mussels , clams , other octopuses and , in emergency ? often just before death ? parts of its own armlike tentacles . In turn , it is eaten mainly by large eels ( Moray and conger ) ; by whales , seals and sharks ; and by men , especially in Asia , Africa and the Mediterranean region . It has a flavor like shellfish , " says Ken Norris . " Very good . But it 's a problem to dislodge the sucker disks from the roof of my mouth . " Octopus meat can be tough . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , " said another scientist . Natives have learned to beat the octopus to tenderize it . In Hawaii , old washing machines are used for the purpose . Hugo made it out that his octopus , a resident of the Channel Islands , was a huge monster capable of drowning a man . Actually , a few cephalopods around there sometimes have arms 21/2 feet long , weigh maybe 20 pounds . On our North Pacific coast , 50- or 60-pounders , with sevenfool ; arms , are fairly common . The biggest Norris ever caught was an 85-pounder with 9 1/2-foot tentacles . In the South Pacific the arms stretch out to a length of 14 feet but they get mighty thin and stringy . Even there , a 200-pound cephalopod would be a giant . Many octopuses are tiny : The tentacles of some adults never exceed an inch in length . Hugo had his beast try to gouge out a man 's eyes with its tough beak . Every octopus has a beak but , Kenneth Norris Retiring and shy , they are extremely clever at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even as you and I. reports , the large ones do n't bite humans . " I 've handled quite a lot , especially the big ones , for the last eight years , " he says . " They 've never bitten me . " It 's the tiny ones that bite . " A. little bitty one in the Gulf of California , " says Norris . " Inch-and-a-half arms . He 's the one that fights . He bites . He has an anticoagulant in his saliva . You keep bleeding , It hurts like the deuce . " Hugo said the octopus could crush a man , like a boa constrictor , and also choke him . In spite of the pressure you feel when the arms enwrap you , this is more balderdash . The octopus neither squashes nor throttles . The only wounds on record , from any octopus , besides the bites of small ones , are occasional red marks , with the skin rarely broken , where the suckers have gripped . Teuthologists agree with Hugo on one detail : The grip of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 ; actually , most have 240 on an arm , or 1,920 altogether . The suction cups are better than those on your windshield because they can curve around and adhere to a round surface like your arm . They are , says a U. S. naturalist , one of the most efficient systems among animals for capturing prey , better by far than claws or teeth , and inferior only to the hand of man with its opposable thumb . But the grip is not unbreakable . Caught by a South Pacific big one , a diving U. S. scientist bent his legs , thrust up from the bottom , and by himself jerked the octopus loose from its anchorage , and brought it up with him . Murray A. Newman , curator of the Vancouver Public Aquarium , says that his skin divers work this way as routine . They go out and try to persuade octopuses to wrap  | around their bodies so they can bring ' em up . Newman himself has proved how wrong Victor Hugo was in labeling the octopus the terror of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because you can train an octopus , which can learn . and can remember what it learns . For perhaps the most amazing thing science has discovered about the cephalopod is its brain : Connected to a marvelous nervous system , and to eyes as good as , and in structure almost identical with your own , the brain makes the octopus one of the keenest-witted creatures in the sea and certainly the smartest of all animals without backbones . The high I. Q. of the octopus is what permits Murray Newman to teach his pets to show the public how harmless they are . Describing one of them , Newman writes : " When the octopus sees his keeper above his tank , he blushes with excitement and stretches his arms up toward the surface . The tendril-like tips curl up over the side of the tank and will wrap around a finger as delicately as a baby 's hand . " And Cecil Brosseau , of the Point Defiance Aquarium in Tacoma , proves the tameness of the supposedly fierce octopus by having his octopuses take herring from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturalist : " They have , missed the status of brainy intelligence . of which man is the foremost example . only by a very narrow margin . There is good evidence that at one time the forefathers of the present octopuses very nearly ruled the world . Had they been able to pass the barrier of the edge of the ocean . . . there might have been no limit to the amazing forms which might have peopled the earth . "
