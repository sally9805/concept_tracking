To U.S. airlines , harassed by passengers who fail to show up for reservations , Spain is an airline paradise . Iberia , the Spanish government 's airline , has more passengers than it can handle . Almost every seat on every flight is filled ; often the only way to wangle a ride is by a special letter of introduction to the pilot . <P> Last week Iberia proudly announced its gross for 1954 : $12,500,000 , an alltime record . With more planes gross income could have been twice as much . Said one Iberia executive : " It 's just gotten too big for us . We have to refuse hundreds of people every day . " Potholes &; Safety Belts . The reason for Iberia 's booming business is simply that flying is the best way to get around in Spain . By rail , the 312-mile trip to Barcelona from Madrid takes all day , costs $9.50 on a rattletrap train . Highway travel is just as bad-over narrow , potholed , mountainous roads . But in one of Iberia 's 32 British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Barcelona trip takes less than two hours , costs only $11.50 . <P> The line has grown so fast that it has little time or inclination for the frills U.S. airlines use to tempt passengers . <P> The planes that fly its routes to six Spanish cities and to 28 others stretching across four continents are plainly decorated , sometimes even dirty . Often on domestic runs , Iberia has no stewardesses . <P> " The Spanish temperament defies authority , " said one resigned official . " We used to have a flight attendant check the seat belts , but our passengers were infuriated . Now we just leave them alone . " <P> Across the Atlantic . Iberia has not always flown in such balmy weather . Starting in 1927 with four noisy , German-made , trimotor planes , it made not a single peseta until 1946 . After several reorganizations , the original airline went under , after serving the Loyalist cause during the Spanish civil war . Its successor was started in 1937 by Franco , who needed a transport service , and asked Germany 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Britain and the U.S. warned Spain to cancel its agreement with Germany or lose its gasoline supplies , Franco nationalized the company , has since bought up the stock from private investors . <P> Today , under President Jesus Rubio Paz , who started as a pilot in 1937 , Iberia is beginning to expand into the transatlantic market . Last August the line inaugurated its first U.S.-Madrid flight with three nonstop Lockheed Super-Constellations , bought entirely with its own profits . Says President Paz , whose three new Super-Connies are named the Pinta , Nia , and Santa Maria , after Columbus ' tiny fleet : " Our crossings will build a sort of aerial bridge , subtle and invisible , on the common ground of friendship .
