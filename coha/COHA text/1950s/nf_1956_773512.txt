txt // discretionary control over programming . Again and again members of the Senate subcommittee pinpointed the issue : Senator McFarland : Would the effect of your language be to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from refusing to renew a license , no matter how poor the programs may have been over that station ? Mr. Miller : If it is merely a matter of poor programming , it would ; yes . The Chairman Senator Wallace H. White : I would like to have your view as to whether , in reaching a conclusion as to the public service or the want of public service being rendered , the regulatory body has a right to look at the programs and has any control whatsoever over the programs sent out . Mr. Miller : I think it has not . The Chairman : So you would say that the quality of the program has nothing to do with the question of whether a public service is being rendered or is not being rendered . Mr. Miller : I do .. . The Chairman : ... Why , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of the program is the outstanding factor in determining whether the station is performing a public service or is not . The Chairman : You deny the right of the Government , I take it , from what I have heard of your statement , to look at the station program record of the station , in order to determine one of the considerations which would lead to a determination of whether that station should be relicensed or not ? Mr. Stanton President of CBS : That is correct , Senator . That is my position . Mr. Trammell President of NBC : . . . I do not believe that you would want to put into a Government agency the right to review the programs of the broadcaster .. The Chairman : ... so long as we have in the law that basic conception that an applicant has no absolute right to a license but must establish to the satisfaction of the Commission that he is serving a public interest or meeting a public necessity or a public convenience , something which seems to me basic in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be any judgment as to whether a station is serving a public interest or not unless there is a chance to view and review the programs which a station has been passing out ... 10 Put in the terms we have been using here , the broadcasters ' argument was that economic incentives , as modified by the broadcasters ' own evaluation of public opinion , provide a sufficient control over the program service , and that any additional control exerted by the FCC is unnecessary , unwise , and legally unjustifiable . Legislators on the Subcommittee challenged this view , holding in effect that an independent evaluation of public opinion should be made by an agency that had no financial interest in the outcome ? i.e. , the FCC. // THE " QUANTITATIVE THEORY " OF CONTROL How can the contention be justified that the broadcaster himself can adequately appraise public opinion and voluntarily submit to its dictates ? The argument runs as follows : The commercial value of broadcasting depends on its ability to reach an audience ; members of the audience are free to tune in or out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This process is likened to democracy in action : tuning in a program is equivalent to a vote for that program ; if a program receives but few votes it can not survive , and a more popular candidate wins the election . Broadcasters , to put it another way , give the public what it wants , and the public makes its wants known through its tuning behavior . Typical examples at the network and local levels are the following : The thenpresident of NBC , Niles Trammell , is quoted as saying some years ago : " The broadcasting of any radio program which a substantial proportion of the available audience wants to listen to at the time it goes on the air is an example of broadcasting in the public interest . " ' The president of a small District of Columbia station , whose license renewal was recently approved over the dissent of three commissioners , declared that the " best answer " to allegations of objectionable advertising practices on his station was the fact that its audience had increased in size.12 For convenience we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It regards programs merely as a means to an end , not as an end in themselves . The advertiser is essentially indifferent to program content , as long as the program attracts audiences . He would be just as happy to sponsor Lucia di Lammermoor as Ma Perkins if grand opera could sell as much detergent as soap opera . The index of success is a quantitative one ? the number of " votes . " The implications of this theory of program control are worth exploring in detail . To begin with , it is axiomatic that broadcasting should serve all the people ( the basis for this assertion appears in Chapter 21 ) . Yet no program has ever proved universally popular . Only a very few ? a fraction of 1 per cent of the total ? attract even as much as a majority of the available audience . Most of the time group differences limit the audience of any given program to a relatively small minority of the total population . As has so often been pointed out , " the audience " or " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operationally . Each program automatically selects a fraction of the potential audience . The service as a whole reaches an aggregation of minority publics . The quantitative approach to programming is almost bound to leave out some of these minority publics which are either too // small , too hard to please , too scattered , or too stubborn to be economically worth while . In answer to this the proponent of the quantitative theory is likely to resort to the political analogy . In an election somebody has to lose ; the majority rules . This analogy , however , overlooks the fact that even in a democracy elections do not decide everything ; once elected , the people 's representatives are expected to use responsible judgment on the issues that come before them . The losing side does not lose its rights . The non-voter is not penalized for his failure to vote . A system which makes the will of the majority the only standard and sacrifices the rights and interests of minorities is the opposite of a democratic system . To continue the political analogy , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience " votes " in terms of set-tuning gives the voter no opportunity to select candidates . He is offered a plebiscite , a " yes " or " no " vote on the programs offered . Possibly entirely different programs would please him even better , but the quantitative theory of control provides him no opportunity to learn about possible options . The economic motive unalloyed does not , as we have pointed out , favor taking chances on untried programs . The alleged democratic character of the quantitative theory is completely exploded when we consider that the quantity actually sought is only indirectly large numbers of listener-viewer " votes . " Advertisers are ultimately interested in the number of sales resulting from their advertising , and if large numbers of sales can be obtained from audiences of small numbers , audience size is no longer the only quantity that counts . It happens that audience size and quantity of response usually parallel each other . But some programs deliberately and with foreknowledge sacrifice audience size for the sake of sales volume . This is the rationale of much per-inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it automatically eliminates most of the audience and holds only the least discriminating minority . This minority , by virtue of its lack of discrimination , is characteristically most susceptible to high-pressure salesmanship and therefore makes a high purchasing response despite its small size . " GIVING THE PUBLIC WHAT IT WANTS " Formulation of the quantitative theory of program control in terms of ' " giving the public what it wants " raises several interesting questions : ( I ) k what the public wants necessarily what it should get ? ( 2 ) Is it in face possible to determine , by the available methods , what the public wants ? ( : i ) Is what the public now wants ( or has wanted ) necessarily the best guide to what it may want in the future ? ( 4 ) Is any " giving " actually involved ? ' ' The theory that ally kind of program is justified if it commands a large // audience has been specifically rejected in other areas of economic activity . The fact that many people will buy a product or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or service in the eyes of society . Pure food and drug laws and narcotics and gambling laws are familiar examples to the contrary . Mr. Neville Miller NAB President : With the economic competition which we have in this country and which we hope will continue to exist , that is the controlling force . The Chairman Senator Burton K. Wheeler : Now , if you say the economic thing should be controlling . . . most of the people of the country like to gamble , we will say , and the radio people say because of that fact they listen to our gambling programs . Supposing that a great many people like things that border on the obscene . Should radio companies put on that kind of a program ? If they are going to be governed simply by the economics of the thing , that is what would happen.14 How does one determine what the public wants ? In Chapter 16 we discussed at some length the expensive and elaborate machinery of measurement and evaluation employed by the industry . Because so much money and ingenuity go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the broadcaster just what the public wants often goes unchallenged . But let us recall that most of this research measures nothing more than tuning behavior ? an overt response that can have infinite shades of meaning . That each individual who turns on a set to a given program actually rants that program in any psychologically significant sense is clearly an unwarranted assumption . A person may merely tolerate that program as the least of several evils . He may accept whatever comes first to hand , without even considering what alternatives are actually available . His reaction could be anything from intense pleasure to intense irritation , but as long as his set is turned on he is classified as " wanting " that program ? wanting it , moreover , in preference to every other program available at the same time . Not infrequently one hears the assertion that programs are literally controlled by the audience , that the switching off or on of receivers by some magic translates itself automatically into program fare . Even if we accept the current relatively crude research procedures as reliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate , so rapid , and so universally employed as to provide such robot-like control . Indeed , such a gross oversimplification is palpably absurd , since if station operators knew how to conduct programming with such precision no station would be likely to fail for hick of an audience , and an office boy could serve as program director . The facts that sonic stations do fail and that creative program directors command high salaries argue that operators are far from having unerring knowledge of audiencc wants . // What do people want ? Essentially , that which they already have or see ) thers enjoying . The social deviant , the exception , the genius , may want something different , but , as was pointed out in Chapter 6 , invention does Not automatically lead to innovation . New wants are created by the corn ) ined efforts of inventors and innovators to overcome social inertia . Had the world been ruled by plebiscites among the mass of people ( who are Neither inventors nor innovators ) , we should still be in the Stone Age ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the phrase " giving the public what it wants " denies the obvious Ind highly relevant fact that commercial broadcasting is not a matter of giving " but a matter of selling . If any giving is involved , it is the giving ) f licenses to use the public 's radio frequencies for commercial purposes , for which no charge is made . A broadcaster who insists , as some still do , that he is giving a service to the public simply does not face the facts , which are ( 1 ) that he is using public property for which the public is entitled to a return as a matter of legal right and ( 2 ) that he is using a medium which lepends on the public 's direct investment in receivers and payment of maintenance and operating costs ( see Table 23 ) . We have gone to some length in this analysis of the quantitative theory of program control because it is so persistently used and because it so completely beclouds the issues involved . Since the quantitative theory patently foes not account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what actually does happen . Those who exercise economic control ) f the program service learn through experience with the medium and its Nublics to measure the climate of public opinion at the moment . They have No certain knowledge of public needs , tastes , or tolerance limits . Every program decision is a guess . Those whose decisions are guided entirely h ' quantitative considerations regard the public with contempt as a de-human.zed mass . If the public consists of these hypothetical creatures , the broad raster is relieved of any responsibility for its welfare . He is justified in taking he easiest way to a large audience ? or to a highly susceptible small midi rote ? irrespective of the kind of programming that results or the kind of effects produced . On the other hand , the alternative point of view concedes that a human being is a thing of value and that a public consists of human beings fit whose welfare the broadcaster has a degree of responsibility . On this : heory the broadcaster will temper purely quantitative considerations with some thought of the outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a business and can not be divorced from business motivat .. s long as broadcasting is conducted competitively for gain it can not re , ' onably be expected to behave as though it were conducted as a non-profit ervice . A balance must be struck somewhere between the extremes of complete 14 Supra , p. 247. // irresponsibility toward the public welfare and complete irresponsibility toward commercial obligations . One function of the law is to help to define the nature and degree of public responsibility which the public interest must regard as minimal . Unfortunately , the law brings with it a burden of bureaucracy and a threat to freedom which may penalize the responsible along with the irresponsible . This fact accounts for the resistance that is offered to government encroachments by even highly ethical and responsible representatives of the industry . CHANGING INDUSTRY OUTLOOK In recent years , however , a good deal of evidence has appeared to suggest that the broadcasting industry as a whole has been withdrawing somewhat from the extreme opposition to government controls expressed in the S. 1333 hearings in 1947 . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the excesses due to the quantitative theory may be a proper subject for legal sanctions . The following statement by NBC vice-president ( and former FCC commissioner ) Charles R. Denny is symptomatic : In planning our programs , we start with the conviction that broadcasting can not do its job by meeting the lowest common denominator of taste .. . We do not feel that the popularity of a program justifies departures from high standards of taste . If the program is popular despite such departures from taste , we feel it would be even more popular if it conformed to proper standards of taste . Over and above that , we feel that broadcasting should provide for the cultivation of taste and the stimulation of interest , not for a few people , but for all of the people . We believe that if we offer the people opportunities to develop their tastes and broaden their interests , they will respond . And one of the ways we reach them is through their common interest in being entertained.rs And lest this be taken as mere window-dressing for the sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBC has actually done something to implement these ideas in both radio and television programs . Another example is provided by J. L. Van Volkenburg , President of CBS Television : In the familiar debate between giving people what . they want and giving them what we think they ought to have , we take the position of The American Library Association , which was stated at a recent convention : " It is inevitable in the give and take of the democratic process that the political , the moral , or the aesthetic concepts of an individual or group will occasionally collide with those of another individual or group . In a free society , each // individual is free to determine for himself what he wishes to read , and each group is free to determine what it will recommend to its freely associated members . But no group has the right to take the law into its own hands , and to impose its own concepts of politics or morality or aesthetics upon other members of a democratic society . " The most constructive solution to the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns of taste.17 Another clue to the changed outlook of the industry is the contrast between the points of view implied by the radio code and the television code . " The latter indicates a much more sophisticated concept of the social role of the medium and also the explicit acceptance of a higher degree of responsibility by the industry . The tendency of the television networks to reassert their control over programming ( discussed in Chapters 15 and 17 ) is concrete evidence of change . This shift in attitude can be ascribed to a number of possible causes . Of course the process is still going on , and we can not yet get a reliable perspective . With the fading of the New Deal the FCC may have grown less inclined to what Justin Miller called " ideological forays " against the industry , more inclined to consider the business interests of broadcasters . However , there has been no noticeable retreat on the part of more recent appointees to the Commission under the Republican administration from the principles and practices of the Commission under the previous administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little frightened ? by the tremendous impact of television . The effect of the Kefauver crime hearings , the Army-McCarthy hearings , and other such events could not have failed to impress the industry with a sense of newfound power . New television licensees , of course , have experienced nc previous regulatory conditions with which to compare present conditions . It must be borne in mind that television started after the FCC had developed a philosophy and a machinery of regulation . By and large new licensees seem to have approached the programming promises they made in applications with less of the cynicism which characterized many radio applications of earlier days , when many applicants apparently regarded the licensing procedure as a meaningless ritual . The change may be partly due to the fact that competitive applicants have been quick to expose unrealistic pinposals , empty promises , and meaningless window-dressing . The public 's intense interest , probably coupled with an improved understanding of its own rights , has made both industry and audience more conscious of program standards : insofar as television represents a new instrument of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It can be argued that tale vision is a more effective medium for some kinds of desirable programs // which could not be so well handled by radio ; greater program scope of television enhances its importance as a medium . This apparent shift in attitude on the part of the industry does not mean either that the industry is any the more prone to accept enlargement of the government 's sphere of control or that the government has sought such an enlargement . It means rather an easier , less contentious atmosphere , with the three agencies of control ? economic , legal , and social ? finding a more stable equilibrium . The Law of Broadcasting Underlying the whole law is recognition of the rapidly fluctuating factors characteristic of the evolution of broadcasting and of the corresponding requirement that the administrative process possess sufficient flexibility to adjust itself to these factors . ? JUSTICE FELIX FRANKFURTER Historically , as we saw in tracing the origin of regulation in Chapter 8 , government intervention in radio affairs arose from the necessity of allocating frequencies in an orderly fashion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the need to ensure efficient use of the frequencies for human benefit . In the United States there is no single agency for over-all frequency management . Authority is divided between the President and the Federal Communications Commission . The former has control over allocation of all government stations ; the FCC 's jurisdiction is confined to private stations , in accordance with Section 305 of the Communications Act of 1934 , which specifically exempts government stations from licensing requirements . This divided authority is regarded as antiquated , and should eventually give way to a single coordinated frequency-management government agency.l At present coordination depends on the Interdepartmental Radio Advisory Committee ( IRAC ) , on which the FCC is represented but which it can not actually control ( Figure 33 ) . Frequency allocation and other technical matters are also affected by international agreements , notably the International Telecommunications Union ( ITU ) and the North American Regional Broadcast Agreement ( NARBA ) . The ITU held its first international conference in Madrid in 1932 . Broadcasting in the United States is most affected by caption Suurovi Nurury A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1949 ) , L. 39. // NARBA , which was first negotiated in Havana in 1937 . On the basis of NARBA , 777 American broadcast stations changed channels in 1941 , primarily to create clear channels for Mexico ( see channel classifications , Table 3 ) . " NARBA occupies a unique place in international telecommunications law : It is the greatest limitation upon the age-old principle of national sovereignty over the use of radio frequencies of any international agreement ever formulated . " " WHERE THE LAW IS FOUND Though a new field of jurisprudence , broadcasting has already accumulated a considerable body of case law and has become a field of legal specialization . The organic law of radio is found in the Communications Act of 1934 , the enactment of which was described in Chapter 8 . It is a federal law , duly passed by the houses of Congress and signed by the President . Congress itself , however , operates within a framework of constitutional law , so that ultimately the Communications Act may be said to derive from the organic law of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis of the commerce clause of the Constitution ( Section 8 ) , which gives the federal government jurisdiction over " Commerce with foreign Nations , among the several States , and with the Indian tribes . " Another major constitutional provision which directly affects the law of radio is the First Amendment , containing the guarantee of freedom of speech and press . Several other constitutional questions have arisen in the course of administering the Communications Act , such as the lawful delegation of legislative powers , taking of private property for public use , due process of law , and state versus federal jurisdiction . The Communications Act is , for the most part , couched in general terms . Specific applications are made by the Federal Communications Commission , which is created by the Act for that purpose . The Commission is the agent through which the government operates in exercising control over communication by radio . In practice , broadcasters generally encounter the law in the form of the FCC Rules and Regulations . Every regulation promulgated by the FCC must , of course , have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ derives its authority ; therefore the Rules and Regulations have the full force of federal law , even though not directly enacted by Congress . Not infrequently the FCC must make decisions in disputes among those who come before it . These decisions , though not in quite the same category as court decisions ( since the FCC is not actually a judicial tribunal ) , tend to establish precedents and to provide a commentary by the FCC on the Coinnwnications Act and its own regulations . // The legality of both the rule-making and the decision-making of the FCC may be challenged in the courts . Appeal may he made to establish whether the Commission acted within the limits placed on it by the Communications Act and other applicable federal laws . Such right of appeal is , of course , a basic concept of American government ; no official or group of officials may exercise unlimited power or undefined discretion . It will be recalled that the absence of limitation on the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce in the Radio Act of 1912 brought about its downfall ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid this pitfall in writing the Radio Act of 1927 . Court decisions ? whether supporting or reversing the FCC ? contribute to the corpus of radio law by establishing legal precedents . Those few disputes which reach the Supreme Court become the leading cases.4 Radio regulation is the province of federal law ; hence stations can not he subjected to both federal and state controls in matters covered by the Communications Act . This does not remove stations entirely from state jurisdiction , however ; for example , libel and slander are matters of state rather than federal law . Similarly , the Communications Act does not interfere with the application of relevant federal laws that are not a part of the Act . Copyright , obscenity , labor , and lottery laws are relevant instances . To summarize , we may find the law of broadcasting embodied in the Communications Act of 1934 , although the Act is subject to the Federal Constitution as the paramount authority . The Communications Act creates the FCC as the specific agent of government control of radio . We may find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the FCC . Other federal and state laws also apply to radio insofar as they deal with matters that are not regulated by the Communications Act . Finally , we may find interpretations of all these laws in the decisions of the FCC and of the courts . GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT The body of our domestic radio law , the Communications Act of 1934 , contains about a hundred sections , grouped into six " titles " : ( 1 ) general provisions , ( 2 ) common carriers , ( 3 ) radio ( in two parts , the first general , the second concerning shipboard radio ) , ( 4 ) procedure and administration , ( 5 ) penalties , and ( 6 ) miscellaneous . Section numbers conform to these groupings ; for example , sections dealing with radio are numbered in the 300 's . We are primarily concerned here with the general provisions which set up the Federal Communications Commission , the first part of the radio provisions , and some of the provisions related to administration and procedure . The present chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the material in terms of the seven principles previously men- // tioned in Chapter 8 . The practical application of these principles and the controversies which arise will be considered in succeeding chapters . The purpose of the Act is set forth as follows : For the purpose of regulating interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio so as to make available , so far as possible , to all the people of the United States a rapid , efficient , Nation-wide , and world-wide wire and radio communication service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges , for the purpose of the national defense , for the purpose of promoting safety of life and property through the use of wire and radio communication , and for the purpose of securing a more effective execution of this policy by centralizing authority heretofore granted by law to several agencies and by granting additional authority with respect to interstate and foreign commerce in wire and radio communication , there is hereby created a commission to be known as the " Federal Communications Commission , " which shall be constituted as hereinafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this Act ( Sec. 1 ) . This first section reminds us that the purpose of repealing the Radio Act of 1927 and substituting the present Act was the centralization of authority ; the 1934 legislation reenacted the 1927 radio laws with only minor changes . It should be noted that the jurisdiction of the FCC is defined as ( 1 ) both wire and radio communications , insofar as they are ( 2 ) either interstate or foreign . PROVISION FOR THE FCC Section 1 provides for a commission to execute and enforce the Act . Section 4 describes the commission . Its seven members are appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate , one member being designated by the President as chairman . Commissioners must be citizens , may not have a financial interest in any type of communications business , must devote full time to the job , and are paid $15,000 a year . ' No more than four of the seven commissioners may be of the same political party . We perceive in these provisions that Congress sought to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The term of seven years , contrasted with the presidential term of four years , makes it impossible for an incoming President to change the personnel of the Commission abruptly ( the terms of the commissioners are staggered so that only one expires each year ) . On the other hand , the President can to some extent implement his administration 's policies through exercising his right to appoint the chairman . // The Commission is empowered to " perform any and all acts , make such rules and regulations , and issue such orders , not inconsistent with this Act , as may be necessary in the execution of its functions " Sec. 4 ( i ) . Elsewhere , throughout the Act , the Commission is given various instructions , most of which are couched in general terms . A few matters , are not left to the discretion of the Commission ; for example , the Act specifically requires that broadcast licenses may be granted for periods of no longer than three years Sec. 307 ( d ) , but even here the Commission may use its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Act give the Commission wide latitude for using its judgment on the basis of the particular set of facts it may be dealing with at the time . Nevertheless , since the Act would have met the same fate as the Radio Act of 1912 if the Commission had been given unqualified discretion , it was essential somehow to limit the Commission 's powers in every case . Congress met this problem ( wherever it did not wish to tie the Commission 's hands with a specific , hard-and-fast directive ) by introducing the matter with the phrase " if public convenience , interest , or necessity requires . . .. " For example : Any station license or construction permit may be modified by the Commission either for a limited time or for the duration of the term thereof , if in the judgment of the Commission such action will promote the public interest , convenience , and necessity , or the provisions of this Act or of any treaty ratified by the United States will be more fully complied with Sec. 316 ( a ) . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vital power ) even though no specific provision of the Act requires such modification , leaving to the Commission the determination of the " public interest , convenience , or necessity . " " OWNERSHIP " OF RADIO FREQUENCIES All the powers of the Commission , as indeed the effectiveness of the Act itself , revolve around the licensing power. ? This in turn derives from the fundamental assertion of the Communications Act ? that electromagnetic frequencies used for communication can not be privately " owned " : It is the purpose of this Act , among other things , to maintain the control of the United States over all the channels of interstate and foreign radio transmission ; and to provide for the use of such channels , but not the ownership thereof , by persons for limited periods of time , under licenses granted by // Federal authority , and no such license shall be construed to create any right beyond the terms , conditions , and periods of the license . No person shall use or operate any apparatus for the transmission of energy or communications or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordance with this Act and with a license in that behalf granted under the provisions of this Act ( Sec. 301 ) . Congress was so emphatic on this point that it required that a licensee sign a waiver " of any claim to the use of any particular frequency or of the ether as against the regulatory power of the United States because of the previous use of the same " ( Sec. 304 ) . Furthermore , although the FCC may determine the form of the licenses it issues , one thing a license must include is the condition that it " shall not vest in the licensee any right to operate the station nor any right in the use of the frequencies designated in the license beyond the term thereof nor in any other manner than authorized therein " Sec. 309 ( d ) ( 1 ) . This emphasis reflects the experience of the period prior to 1927 , when regulation broke down because the law did not give the government unequivocal control of the broadcast frequencies . Congress foresaw , moreover , that the introduction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of frequencies had conferred a kind of squatter 's right on pioneer broadcasters . The licensing power is further safeguarded by the provision that a license can not even be issued until after a station has been constructed and tested ; it can then be determined empirically that its signal does in fact conform to the requirements of the license . Hence the first step toward acquiring a broadcast license is to obtain a Construction Permit ( CP ) . The application for a CP requires a recital of all the information which will be required in the license itself . Upon the completion of any station for the construction . . . of which a permit has been granted , and upon it being made to appear to the Commission that all the terms , conditions , and obligations set forth in the application and permit have been fully met , and that no cause or circumstance arising or first corning to the knowledge of the Commission since the granting of the permit would , in the judgment of the Commission , make the operation of such station against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lawful holder of said permit for the operation of said station . . Sec. 319 ( c ) . Thus Congress made plain its intention of taking no chances on any misinterpretation : the radio frequencies are public property and accordingly must be operated in the public interest . The government may decide not only who shall be licensed to use this property in the first place but whether a licensee shall be entitled to continue to use it after the first grant is made , for license renewals are not automatic but are subject to the discretion of ' the FCC I Sec. 307 ( d ) j ; moreover , a license can be revoked before the expiration of its term ( Sec. 312 ) . This circumstance places broadcasting in // a unique situation ; it is less free of government control than non-licensed businesses , yet more free than public utilities or common carriers . Despite the care with which Congress spelled out its intention , the constitutionality of the licensing power has been challenged a number of times in the courts . Revoking licenses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government use and taking property without due process of law , in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution . But the courts have consistently upheld the power of the government to control the frequencies : That the Congress had the power to give this authority to delete stations , in view of the limited radio facilities available and the confusion that would result from interferences , is not open to question . Those who operated broadcasting stations had no right superior to the exercise of this power of regulation . They necessarily made their investments and their contracts in the light of , and subject to , this paramount authority . This Court has had frequent occasion to observe that the power of Congress in the regulation of interstate commerce is not fettered by the necessity of maintaining existing arrangements which would conflict with the execution of its policy , as such a restriction would place the regulation in the hands of private individuals and withdraw from the control of Congress so much of the field as they might choose by prophetic discernment to bring within the range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on the use of this public property , the radio frequencies , loses all claim to security . It is only when a conflict of interest occurs , when the broadcaster 's private interest conflicts with the public interest in the effective use of the electromagnetic spectrum , that the private interest must give way . The classic instance of this kind of conflict is the resistance of an existing licensee to the addition of another station in his area , on the grounds that there is not enough business to support two stations . This question was adjudicated by the Supreme Court in one of the most frequently cited of all broadcast cases , the Sanders Brothers Case : Plainly it is not the purpose of the Act to protect a licensee against competition but to protect the public . Congress intended to leave competition in the business of broadcasting where it found it , to permit a licensee who was not interfering electrically with other broadcasters to survive or succumb according to his ability to make his programs attractive to the public.9 Another constitutional question raised by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) interstate and ( 2 ) commerce . It must qualify in both these respects in order to be subject to federal control under the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution . These questions were settled relatively early by the courts : // It does not seem to be open to question that radio transmission and reception among the states are interstate commerce . To be sure it is a new species of commerce . Nothing visible and tangible is transported . . . The joint action of the transmitter owned by one person and the receiver owned by another is essential to the result . But that result is the transmission of intelligence , ideas , and entertainment . It is intercourse and that intercourse is commerce ... The suggestion that broadcasting which is not for profit is not commerce may be put aside as imposing an unwarranted limitation upon the power of Congress . ' ? Broadcasting may be regarded as interstate in scope , even though the intended service area of a given station lies entirely within a state , for there is no way of controlling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Davis Amendment abundantly proved , it is impossible to stop radio waves at state lines . " BROADCASTING IS UNIQUE " In Chapter 7 we saw how broadcasting made a radical departure from previous forms of communication enterprise . Its peculiar and separate character is recognized in the Communications Act by three definitions : " Radio communication " or " communication by radio " means the transmission by radio of writing , signs , signals , pictures , and sounds of all kinds , including all instrumentalities , facilities , apparatus , and services ... incidental to such transmissions Sec. 3 ( b ) . " Common carrier " or " carrier " means any person engaged as a common carrier for hire , in interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio or in interstate or foreign radio transmission of energy , except where reference is made to common carriers not subject to this Act ; but a person engaged in radio broadcasting shall not , insofar as such person is so engaged , be deemed a common carrier Sec. 3 ( h ) . " Broadcasting " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public , directly or by the intermediary of relay stations Sec. 3 ( o ) . Preliminarily , it should be observed that the legal definition includes television as well as sound transmission under the term " broadcasting . " The most significant element in this series of definitions , however , is the fact that broadcasting is singled out for exclusion from the category " common carrier . " This distinction is vital . The common-carrier concept ( which extends to transportation systems such as railroads as well as to communication systems ) applies to business enterprises of such character that public policy requires their services to be made available to all on a basis of equality . // The Interstate Commerce Act provides that it shall be unlawful for a carrier subject to that Act to give " any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage " to one user of a carrier over another , or to subject any user to " any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage " ( Chapter I , Sec. 3 1 of the Act ) . This means , among other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pay-telephone and no one questions what we say when we place a call ; all customers pay the same price for a railroad ticket for the same class of service , and all are entitled to buy a ticket as long as space remains . In short , a carrier is supposed to concern itself not with the nature of the traffic it carries but merely with supplying the facilities for carrying ? always assuming lawful kinds of traffic , of course . Carriers occupy a position of limited monopoly , since public policy forbids duplication of services where deterioration of service might result . One can not build a railroad , start a busline , inaugurate an air route , or install a telephone system for public hire without a license , from either a state or a federal agency , depending on whether the proposed service is intrastate or interstate in scope . Such a license carries with it some protection from competition , in return for which the business of the licensee is closely supervised by the licensing agency . AT &T,; for example , can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; an interstate rail line can not alter its service schedule without the permission of the Interstate Commerce Commission . Let us consider what would have been the consequences of applying the common-carrier concept to broadcasting . The licensee would have had to accept all buyers of time on a first-come-first-served basis . The licensee could not concern himself with what the purchasers of time did with that time , so long as nothing unlawful was done . The result would be programming chaos ; the licensee would have no control whatever over what was said or shown on his facilities , and hence could not be held responsible for the character of the broadcasting service rendered . All this would completely reverse the primary emphasis of broadcasting , which is on the interests of the recipients of the messages , not the senders . This emphasis is appropriate because the senders are using a facility ( i.e. , the electromagnetic spectrum ) belonging to the recipients . Those who directly profit economically through the broadcasting service ? the advertisers and licensees ? do so only in consideration of a service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often finds this secondary position of the private economic interests of the licensee difficult to accept ; Ile simply can not see how voluntary investment and risk-taking can fail to entitle him to freedom in his quest for profits . As long as a licensee clings to this point of view he remains at odds with the basic philosophy of the Communications Act . No broadcast application which explicitly placed the interest of the licensee ahead of that of the public would receive serious consideration // One further point needs to be emphasized in connection with the definition of broadcasting . It is a form of communication intended to be received by the public . This phrase automatically excludes from broadcasting all forms of communication which , though perhaps receivable by the public , are aimed at specific recipients . On this basis direct communication to individuals in the audience by broadcast performers is forbidden . Such a communication is a common-carrier use of broadcasting and hence a violation of the law . The FCC does not make an issue of the casual " hellos , " waves of the hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , there have been cases where direct communications have been more substantial . For example , a station received license renewal only after discontinuing programs of direct personal advice by an astrologer and a " spiritual psychologist . " The Commission remarked that their practices involved the transmission of point-to-point or individual messages that could not reasonably be said to have any general interest for the public . Broadcasting is by definition and essential characteristics a service for the general public . The use of a broadcast station for point-to-point delivery of messages is inconsistent with the terms of the station license and the regulations under which licenses are issued.11 An illustration of the practical significance of the definition of broadcasting is provided by the case of " functional " FM operation , i.e. , the providing of special programs for stores , busses , and other locations ( see p. 149 ) . The FCC found this type of service to be non-broadcast in character , and has provided a special class of license to permit FM stations to offer this service , a Subsidiary Communications Authorization. ... in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests of the industrial , mercantile , transportation , or other subscribers and is not primarily intended for reception by the general public , functional FM must be characterized predominantly non-broadcast in nature . The fact that a large portion of these transmissions ? including most of the program material ? may he received by the general public on home receivers as an incidental byproduct of the primary intent of the transmissions does not change this rationale . " Since transmissions under a Subsidiary Communications Authorization are not broadcasting , they come under the protection of Section 605 of the Communications Act , which forbids the unauthorized divulgence or publication of communications subject to the Act . Broadcasting is , necessarily , made an exception to this rule . The applicability of Section 605 to flinc- // tional FM stations , however , empowers the stations to prevent unauthorized persons from installing receivers to take advantage of their service . As long as the service was " broadcasting " they could not prevent this form of piracy . EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF SERVICE It follows from the principle of public ownership of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are entitled to service . Section 1 of the Act , it will be recalled , speaks of " all the people of the United States . " With more specific reference to broadcasting : In considering applications for licenses , and modifications and renewals thereof , when and insofar as there is demand for the same , the Commission shall make such distribution of licenses , frequencies , hours of operation , and of power among the several States and communities as to provide a fair , efficient , and equitable distribution of radio service to each of the same Sec. 307 ( b ) 1 . It will be recalled that the original attempt to equalize distribution of service mathematically proved impracticable ( Chapter 8 ) . Section 307 ( b ) leaves the matter to the judgment of the FCC on a case-to-case basis . Since the Commission is limited by the element of " demand " ( from would-be licensees ) , it can not arrive at an ideal distribution of facilities . The demand will naturally tend to exceed the supply in areas of highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , been successful to some extent in arriving at a compromise between the two kinds of distribution of facilities implied by demand on the one hand and by equity on the other . By setting up nation-wide allocation tables of FM and television channels in advance of authorizing the services , the Commission prevented inequalities which would undoubtedly have arisen if allocations had been governed by random economic demands . The Commission 's authority to make such advance allocation tables has been sustained in the courts.13 " Fair , efficient , and equitable distribution of radio service " has been interpreted to mean more than simply providing a local program service for the benefit of set owners . Both the FRC and the FCC have considered that an important aspect of radio " service " is providing local access to broadcast facilities for the benefit of originators of communications as well as for the benefit of receivers of communications . This interpretation has been supported by the Supreme Court : " Fairness to communities is furthered by a recognition of local needs for a community radio mouthpiece. " 14 This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for advertising , for local candidates to appeal for political support , for local publicservice agencies to promote their objectives , for representatives of local // controversial issues to air their points of view , for local governments to inform the electorate , for local educational and cultural institutions to broaden their community service , for local newsmen to report on community happenings , for local talent to have an outlet , and so on . In short , a station serves its area as a means of community self-expression , giving it a broadcast voice as well as a broadcast ear . LIMITATIONS ON ELIGIBILITY OF LICENSEES Under the principle of public ownership of frequencies , the Act establishes that no private individual can own a frequency allocation . Furthermore , even temporary , licensed use of a frequency allocation is not open to all comers . Licensees must meet certain criteria of eligibility : All applications for station licenses , or modifications or renewals thereof , shall set forth such facts as the Commission by regulation may prescribe as to citizenship , character , and financial , technical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the ownership and location of the proposed station . . . the frequencies and the power desired to be used ; the hours of the day or other periods of time during which it is proposed to operate the station ; the purposes for which the station is to be used ; and such other information as it may require . . . Sec. 308 ( b ) ) . Of these the citizenship qualification is the most specific , since Sec. 310 ( a ) goes on to deny licenses to aliens . An applicant 's financial qualifications can be expressed quantitatively ; he is expected to have enough money at his disposal not only to build a proposed station but to operate it at a loss for a time . Character qualifications can hardly be measured quantitatively . They are revealed by past and present conduct ; on the negative side , for example , prior conviction of a crime or misrepresentation of facts to the Commission would be very damaging . Technical qualifications include knowledge and understanding of the law of broadcasting , of station operations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to be a lawyer , a program director , or an engineer ; but he should show that he has expert counsel in those matters in which he is not himself an expert . If a broadcast license is revoked by a court for violation of anti-monopoly laws the FCC must comply with the court decree ( Sec. 311 ) . Congress was particularly sensitive to the possibility of monopoly in the communications field , having ample precedent to consider . In fact , Section 311 originally also forbade the licensing of persons who had been found guilty of monopoly or unfair competition in the field of radio communication or manufacturing . This part of the Section was repealed in 1952 because of its " double jeopardy " character . Another section permits the revocation of licenses held by a person found guilty of violating antitrust laws in addition to other perniltMs provided by the antitrust laws themselves ( Sec. 313 ) . // THE APPLICABILITY OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT Aware of broadcasting 's significance as a means of public enlightenment , Congress emphasized that in adopting legislation to govern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection against government interference with freedom of the press that is provided by the First Amendment to the Constitution : Nothing in this Act shall be understood or construed to give the Commission the power of censorship over the radio communications or signals transmitted by any radio station , and no regulation or condition shall be promulgated or fixed by the Commission which shall interfere with the right of free speech by means of radio communication ( Sec. 326 ) . Very little else in the Act makes specific reference to the content of the program service . Section 317 requires that commercial matter be announced as paid for and attributed to the source . This rule is intended to prevent anonymous propaganda or advertising in disguise , and is analogous to the publishing practice of printing the word " advertisement " above matter which might otherwise be mistaken as part of the publication 's editorial content . Practically all regular commercial advertising , of course , identifies the sponsor automatically . No formal announcement that matter is paid for is required unless the material might otherwise be misinterpreted as station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view perhaps the most vital function of broadcasting is as an instrument of information and persuasion in connection with the election of public officials . Congress would not be likely to overlook this factor ; accordingly , it made a special provision for candidates for public office : ( a ) If any licensee shall permit any person who is a legally qualified candidate for any public office to use a broadcasting station , he shall afford equal opportunities to all other such candidates for that office in the use of such broadcasting station : Provided , That such licensee shall have no power of censorship over the material broadcast under the provisions of this section . No obligation is hereby imposed upon any licensee to allow the use of its station by any such candidate . ( b ) The charges made for the use of any broadcasting station for any of the purposes set forth in this section shall not exceed the charges made for comparable use of such station for other purposes . ( c ) The Commission shall prescribe appropriate rules and regulations to carry out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be noted that this provision applies only to candidates while they are candidates , not to political officials once they are elected . Moreover , it applies only to the candidates themselves , not to oilier person 's speaking in their behalf . Section 315 imposes no obligation on the licensee // to make his facilities available to candidates in the first place , but once he opens the door to one he must keep it open for other candidates for the same office . Paragraph ( b ) is an amendment adopted in 1952 ; it reflects the fact that many stations had made a practice of charging higher rates to candidates than to commercial advertisers . Section 315 has been one of the most troublesome provisions of the Communications Act , not only because of the inherently controversial nature of politics but also because of a conflict of laws . In prohibiting the licensee from censoring speeches of political candidates , Congress had in mind the possibility that the intention of the law could be circumvented by licensees who wished to favor one candidate simply by emasculating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defamation come under state jurisdiction ; hence the licensee is prohibited under the Federal law from avoiding the commission of what may be an actionable wrong under state law.16 Nothing further in the Act refers directly to programs.76 The layman generally supposes that the Communications Act contains a great deal of regulation concerning programming on which , in fact , the Act is completely silent . It says nothing about sustaining programs , unethical advertising , controversial issues , religion , public-service programs , and the many other program matters which arc associated with the notion of government regulation . Indirectly , however , the Act gives the Commission much latitude in program matters . From the beginning the Commission has assumed that this latitude permits consideration of the character of the program service provided by licensees . This assumption may seem to run directly counter to Section 326 , which explicitly withholds the power of censorship from the Commission . The Commission will not , to be sure , substitute its judgment for that of the licensee by approving or disapproving in advance any program that may be proposed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. , " prior restraint . " The Commission will , however , consider the over-all program service of the licensee . The courts have repeatedly upheld this procedure . Even aside from the question of prior restraint , however , the law assumes that the licensee , with his intimate knowledge of local conditions and needs , is far better qualified than distant bureaucrats to determine what is in the public interest for his locality.17 // An important consequence of the prohibition of censorship , and of the previously outlined principles embodied in the Communications Act , is that unqualified responsibility is placed on the licensee . Neither the FCC nor the courts , neither the purchaser of time nor his agents , can relieve the licensee of his personal responsibility to maintain control of his station and its program service . The government , not the licensee , is prohibited from censoring . To prohibit the licensee from controlling program content would transform broadcasting into a common carrier . That , as we have pointed out , would completely subvert the intention of the Communications Act . Licensee responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a station without permission , and the purchaser must apply for the license and must satisfy all the criteria of an applicant for an original license ( Sec. 310b ) . By the same token , a licensee may not legally turn over the management of a station to another or sell time to a time broker for resale . DISCRETIONARY POWERS OF GOVERNMENT Congress was well aware of the impossibility of writing a really definitive or comprehensive law to govern radio . It therefore left all but a few fundamental matters open to the application of the discretion of the moment . The FCC was created as an arm of Congress to exercise this discretion , and the standard of " public interest , convenience , and necessity " was set up as the limiting factor . With respect to the licensing power the following instructions appear : The Commission , if public convenience , interest , or necessity will be served thereby , subject to the limitations of this Act , shall grant to any applicant therefor a station license provided for by this act Sec. 307 ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application therefor , a renewal of such license may be granted from time to time for a term of not to exceed three years in the case of broadcasting licenses , and not to exceed five years in the case of other licenses , if the Commission finds that public interest , convenience , and necessity would be served thereby . . . Sec. 307 ( d ) . If upon examination of any application for construction permit , license , or modification or renewal thereof the Commission shall find that public interest , convenience , and necessity would be served by the granting thereof , it shall grant such application Sec. 309 ( a ) . No construction permit or station license , or any rights thereunder , shall be transferred , assigned , or disposed of ' in any manner , voluntarily or involuntarily , directly or indirectly , or by transfer of control of any corporation holding such permit or license , to any person except upon application to the // Commission and upon finding by the Commission that the public interest , convenience , and necessity will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any station license or construction permit may be modified by the Commission either for a limited time or for the duration of the term thereof , if in the judgment of the Commission such action will promote the public interest , convenience , and necessity ... Sec. 316 ( a ) . ... changes in the frequencies , authorized power , or in the times of operation , of any station , shall not be made without the consent of the station licensee unless , after a public hearing , the Commission shall determine that such changes will promote public convenience or interest or will serve public necessity . . . Sec. 303 ( f ) .18 Thus the Commission must consult the public interest , convenience , and necessity in making every major decision about licensing . Section 303 of the Act lists a number of rather specific powers of the FCC , including the power to : ( a ) classify stations , ( b ) prescribe the nature of the service to be rendered , ( c ) assign frequencies , ( d ) determine station location , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( f ) prevent interference , ( g ) study new uses for radio and provide for experimental uses of frequencies , ( i ) make special regulations for network stations , ( j ) require the keeping of records , ( 1 ) prescribe qualifications for station operators and issue them licenses , ( o ) designate call letters , and ( p ) publish necessary information . This entire list , however , is preceded by the admonition to do these things " as public convenience , interest or necessity requires . " All this gives the Commission wide latitude , since very few significant provisions fail to leave the door open for the exercise of its discretion . The phrase " public interest , convenience , and necessity , " or any variant thereof , therefore takes on critical importance ; in effect , it determines the practical results of the application of the generalities contained in the law . The function of the public-interest concept has been well summarized in a court decision : The Congress of the United States , which has plenary power to regulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative agent , because it is desired to have the regulatory work done by technically trained experts , skilled and experienced in the technical duties of radio regulation . The Congress defined the scope of the authority of its agent or , as is sometimes said , it established the standard according to which the agent should act . The broad scope of authority , or standard of action , established by the Communications Act is that public interest , convenience and necessity must be served . Within that framework the administrative agent is free to exercise its expert judgment ; it can not act unconstitutionally , for neither could its principal , the Congress , and the stream can not rise higher than the source ; it must proceed within the scope of the authority granted to it , that is to say , // it must observe the standard established ; and it can not act arbitrarily or capriciously . . . The doctrine is that the act of the administrative agent is the act of Congress itself ; as long as the agent stays within the boundaries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . It would be difficult , if not impossible , to formulate a precise and comprehensive definition of the term " public interest , convenience , or necessity " , and it has been said often and properly by the courts that the facts of each case must be examined and must govern its determination . " As the Court remarked , the Commission may not act arbitrarily or capriciously in its decisions or rule-making . In the first place , it can not take any important action involving opposing interests without first holding a hearing and considering the points of view of the persons involved . If the Commission decides not to grant a license request , it must advise the applicant and others concerned of its objections ; the applicant then has an opportunity to reply , and if the Commission still decides against the applicant , it must set the matter for hearing , " specifying with particularity the matters and things in issue " ( Sec. 309 b ) . If the Commission proposes to change a station 's power , frequency , or time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Sec. 303 f ) . On the other hand , if the Commission grants an application without a hearing , the grant is subject for thirty days to protest from " any party in interest " ; if the protest shows the protestant to be a real party in interest raising specific issues , the Commission must hold a hearing on the matter and postpone the effective date of its decision ( Sec. 309 c ) . ' 0 After hearings are held , the hearing officers ( either Commissioners or hearing examiners delegated for the purpose ) must file an initial decision . Exceptions may then be filed by the parties involved , pointing out objections to the conclusions reached in the decision . If requested , the Commission must then consider oral arguments on the exceptions before issuing a final decision or order ( Sec. 409 b ) . If the Commission wishes to revoke a license or issue a cease-and-desist order , it must first invite the licensee to appear at a hearing to show cause why such action should not be taken ( Sec. 312 c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Administrative Procedures Act , which applies in general to agencies of the federal government . Finally , a " person aggrieved or whose interests are adversely affected " by a decision or order which grows out of a hearing may also petition for a rehearing , although the Commission may use its own discretion in granting such requests ( Sec. 405 ) . // These safeguards ensure that persons affected by a Commission action have ample opportunity to be heard ; they can not be subjected to summary or arbitrary decisions . Although the FCC is only quasi-judicial ( i.e. , is not strictly speaking a court of law ) , its procedures must conform in general to judicial standards and it must , of course , observe the safeguards provided by the Constitution . On occasion judges have reminded the FCC of these obligations : ... it will be helpful to spell out the process which a commission properly follows in reaching a decision . The process necessarily includes at least four parts : ( 1 ) Evidence must be taken and weighed , both as to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this evidence a determination of facts of a basic or underlying nature must be reached ; ( 3 ) from these basic facts the ultimate facts , usually in the language of statute , are to be inferred , or not , as the case may be ; ( 4 ) from this finding the decision will follow by the application of the statutory criterion . Administrative orders , quasi-judicial in character , are void , if a hearing was denied , if that granted was inadequate or manifestly unfair , if the finding is contrary to the indisputable character of the evidence , or if the facts found do not as a matter of law support the order made . The commission may not capriciously make findings by administrative fiat . Such authority , however beneficently exercised in one case , could be injuriously exercised in another , is inconsistent with rational justice , and comes within the Constitution 's condemnation of all arbitrary exercise of power.21 THE RIGHT OF APPEAL Even after all the safeguards of hearings , rehearings , initial decision , exceptions , and oral arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules or decisions still has a further recourse . Section 402 provides for appeals to the courts to enjoin , set aside , annul , or suspend Commission actions . Most appeals go to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia , which is open to : ( 1 ) a person whose application for a CP or license has been denied ; ( 2 ) a person whose application for renewal or modification has been denied ; ( 3 ) a person whose application for transfer of ownership of CP or license has been denied ; ( 4 ) a person whose CP has been modified or revoked ; ( 5 ) " any other person who is aggrieved or whose interests are adversely affected by any order of the Commission " granting or denying an application ; ( 6 ) a person who has received a cease-and-desist order ; or ( 7 ) an operator whose license has been suspended . If the Court of Appeals fails to satisfy a litigant , he can petition the Supreme Court of the United States to review the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not bound to accept the case if in // its opinion no substantial Federal question is involved . In such a case the decision of the lower court becomes final . All the materials developed at hearings and the other procedures prior to an appeal become part of the record for consideration by the courts . Generally speaking , the courts have taken the position that they should not substitute their judgment for that of the FCC , which is the body set up by Congress for the purpose of bringing expert judgment to bear on regulatory problems . The court usually confines its actions to determining whether the Commission has followed proper procedure , whether it has acted within its lawful powers , and whether it has been arbitrary or capricious in its conclusions . As Supreme Court Justice Frankfurter has said , Congress has charged the courts with the responsibility of saying whether the Commission has fairly exercised its discretion within the vaguish , penumbral bounds expressed by the standard of " public interest . " It is our responsibility to say whether the Commission has been guided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the disciplined feel of the expert , to bear on applications for licenses in the public interest.22 72 FCC v. N ( 'A ( ' rnnmurdrufions , Ins. , : 1.1H I. ti 8 ( i ; i1 I ) 1 ( IU n. i ) . 22 Administration of the Law Congress ... did not frustrate the purposes for which the Communications Act of 1934 was brought into being by attempting an itemized catalogue of the specific manifestations of the general problems for the solution of which it was establishing a regulatory agency . ? JUSTICE FELIX FRANKFURTER The FCC is one of nine independent regulatory commissions of the federal government . Other examples are the Interstate Commerce Commission ( the first , set up in 1887 ) and the Federal Trade Commission . These agencies supervise private activities in commerce , utilities , transportation , labor , finance , and communication ? dynamic fields of enterprise over which Congress could not maintain effective supervision without administrative intermediaries . A relatively new , hybrid governmental organization results , one which blurs the traditional lines of demarcation between the legislative , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function of the FCC is executive : the carrying out of laws enacted by the legislative branch . Insofar as it makes rules and regulations , which have the force of law , the FCC also has a legislative function ; and insofar as it makes decisions in controversies it has a quasi-judicial function . This mixed responsibility is reflected in the method of setting up the Commission . It comes into existence at the instance of Congress , which created the FCC and defined its scope of operation . On the other hand , it serves as an arm of the executive branch . The American system of checks and balances is well exemplified here , for although the President appoints the commissioners his choice must be approved by the Senate . Approval is not automatic . Not infrequently the Senate holds extensive hearings on appointments by way of reminding appointees of their responsibility to Congress . ' Moreover , Congress constantly looks over the shoulder of the // Commission . It is one of the most often investigated of all government agencies . Every major question that comes before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interstate Commerce Committee , the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee , a special Select Committee , and occasionally one of the other standing committees of Congress . Finally Congress can always have the last word in the long run , since it approves the FCC budget and has the power to change the Communications Act itself . THE ORGANIZATION AND THE WORKLOAD OF THE FCC Broadcasting itself is the concern of only one of the dozen bureaus and offices of the FCC ( Fig. 34 ) , the largest of which is the Field Engineering and Monitoring Bureau . Over a thousand employees are needed to staff not only the Washington headquarters but also 24 district offices and 18 monitoring stations . Decisions concerning licenses are at the core of the Commission 's work , but it has many other important functions , among them participation in international conferences , commenting or testifying on domestic legislative proposals , investigating interference complaints , detecting and locating illegal stations , inspecting stations , conducting technical research , and approving new communications-equipment models . Although common-carrier and safety and special radio services involve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Table 2 ) , the work of the Broadcast Bureau is the most complex and difficult . Nonbroadcast problems do not often involve highly controversial questions and highly competitive , mutually exclusive applications , nor do they involve the general public to the same extent as broadcasting . Broadcasting is everybody 's business , so everybody wants to tell the FCC how to regulate it . THE RULES AND REGULATIONS The origin of the FCC Rules and Regulations has been previously described ( Chapter 8 ) . They convert the generalities of the Communications Act into applicable form . Each service is governed by a separate part of the rules , and other parts cover administrative procedures , organization of the Commission , delegations of authority , and the like . Broadcast services are covered by Part 3 , which includes subparts for standard broadcast , FM , noncommercial FM , television , and international broadcast stations . New rules are first issued in the form of proposals , so that interested parties may have an opportunity to comment . On complex matters ( such , for example , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearings or fact-gathering investigations may be conducted . When // finally adopted , rules must be published in the Federal Register in order to go into official effect . Examples comparing the way the Communications Act treats a topic with the way the FCC rules enlarge upon it will serve to clarify the relationship between the two . The Communications Act provides as follows : All matter broadcast by any radio station for which service , money , or any other valuable consideration is directly or indirectly paid , or promised to or charged or accepted by , the station so broadcasting , from any person , shall , at the time the same is so broadcast , be announced as paid for or furnished , as the case may be , by such person ( Sec. 317 ) . The Rules and Regulations governing television ( for example ) expand this brief statement to : ? 3.654 . Sponsored programs , announcement . ( a ) In the case of each program for the broadcasting of which money , services , or other valuable consideration is either directly or indirectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any television broadcast station , the station broadcasting such program shall make , or cause to be made , an appropriate announcement that the program is sponsored , paid for , or furnished , either in whole or in part . ( b ) In the case of any political program or any program involving the discussion of public controversial issues for which any films , records , transcriptions , talent , scripts , or other material or services of any kind are furnished , either directly or indirectly , to a station as an inducement to the broadcasting of such program , an announcement shall be made both at the beginning and conclusion of such program on which such material or services are used that such films , records , transcriptions , talent , scripts , or other material or services have been furnished to such station in connection with the broadcasting of such program : Provided , however , That only one such announcement need be made in the case of any such program of 5 minutes ' duration or less , which announcement may be made either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c ) The announcement required by this section shall fully and fairly disclose the true identity of the person or persons by whom or in whose behalf such payment is made or promised , or from whom or in whose behalf such services or other valuable consideration is received , or by whom the material or services referred to in paragraph ( b ) of this section are furnished . Where an agent or other person contracts or otherwise makes arrangements with a station on behalf of another , and such fact is known to the station , the announcement shall disclose the identity of the person or persons in whose behalf such agent is acting instead of the name of such agent . ( d ) I n the case of any program , other than a program advertising commercial products or services , which is sponsored , paid for or furnished , either in whale or in part , or for which material or services referred to in paragraph ( h ) of this section are furnished , by a corporation , committee , association or other unincorporated group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of such corporation , committee , acssociation or other unincoporated group . In each such case the station shall require that a list ni the // chief executive officers or members of the executive committee or of the board of directors of the corporation , committee , association or other unincorporated group shall be made available for public inspection at one of the television broadcast stations carrying the program . ( e ) In the case of programs advertising commercial products or services , an announcement stating the sponsor 's corporate or trade name or the name of the sponsor 's product , shall be deemed sufficient for the purposes of this section and only one such announcement need be made at any time during the course of the program . In the foregoing example , the rules clarify and expand a mandatory provision of the Act , with due recognition of several practical questions which arise in the application of the provision . The next example illustrates more extensive improvisation by the FCC on a permissive , rather than mandatory , provision of the Act . The Communications Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Act , the Commission from time to time , as public convenience , interest , or necessity requires shall ? ( j ) Have authority to make general rules and regulations requiring stations to keep such records of programs , transmissions of energy , communications , or signals as it may deem desirable . This leaves the Commission with the option of requiring anything from no records at all to as detailed and extensive records as it may " deem desirable . " In practice the Commission has concluded that it needs two types of records : one covering the technical operation of transmitters , the other covering the content of programming . 0.663 . Logs ; maintenance of . The licensee or permittee of each television station shall maintain program and operating logs and shall require entries to be made as follows : ( a ) In the program log : ( 1 ) An entry of the time each station identification announcement ( call letters and location ) is made . ( 2 ) An entry briefly describing each program broadcast , such as " music , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with the name or title thereof and the sponsor 's name , with the time of the beginning and ending of the complete program . If a mechanical reproduction , either visual or aural , is used , the entry shall show the exact nature thereof and the time it is announced as a mechanical reproduction . If a speech is made by a political candidate , the name and political affiliations of such speaker shall be entered . ( 3 ) An entry showing that each sponsored program broadcast has been announced as sponsored , paid for , or furnished by the sponsor ; or that the broadcast is under the auspices of a nonprofit educational organization other than the licensee or permittee. ( 4 ) An entry showing , for each program of network origin , the name of the network originating the program . // ( b ) In the operating log : ( 1 ) An entry of the time the station begins to supply power to the antenna , and the time it stops . ( 2 ) An entry of the time the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each interruption to the carrier wave , its cause , and duration . ( 4 ) An entry of the following each 30 minutes : ( i ) Operating constants of last radio stage of the aural transmitter ( total plate current and plate voltage ) . ( ii ) Transmission line meter readings for both transmitters . ( iii ) Frequency monitor readings.2 O O O O O A further section provides rules on how long logs must be retained ( two years ) , who must keep them ( persons having actual knowledge of the facts ) , the form of logs ( " suitable " ) , how logs may be corrected ( only by original keeper ) , and the use of rough logs ( must be kept on file ) . A final example will illustrate a rule for which there is no specific authority in the Act but which is generally authorized under Sec. 303 ( r ) , which empowers the Commission to make " such rules and regulations and prescribe such restrictions and conditions . . . as may be necessary to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No specific mention is made in the Act concerning station identification announcements ; yet it is desirable to be able readily to identify the source of all radio signals . Accordingly , the Commission 's rules include such provisions as these : ? 3.652 . Station identification . ( a ) A licensee of a television broadcast station shall make station identification announcement ( call letters and location ) at the beginning and ending of each time of operation and during the operation on the hour . The announcement at the beginning and ending of each time of operation shall be by both aural and visual means . Other announcements may be by either aural or visual means . ( b ) Identification announcements during operation need not be made when to make such announcement would interrupt a single consecutive speech , play , religious service , symphony concert , or any type of production . In such cases , the identification announcement shall be made at the first interruption of the entertainment continuity and at the conclusion thereof . MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE APPLICATIONS It will be helpful to an understanding of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of view of a license applicant . In most cases nowadays an application for a new license is likely to be contested by one or more rival applicants . Such mutually exclusive applications provide the most revealing test of the FCC 's interpretation of public interest , convenience , and necessity , for each applicant usually meets the statutory requirements for a license ; therefore the Commission must fall back on the // issue of which will best serve the public interest to find a basis of differentiation . The specific statutory requirements are relatively simple : a licensee must be a citizen of the United States , and must have suitable " character , " financial , and technical qualifications.5 Most applicants are equally able to meet these requirements . That is , each will be a citizen and have a good character , enough money to build a station and operate it at a loss for a reasonable length of time , competent engineering advice on all technical requirements , and experienced program personnel capable of planning a diversified service . At this point the applicant ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior decisions of the FCC for either refinements of these grounds or additional grounds on which to claim superiority . A survey of the FCC 's first year of decisions , for example , reveals that it considered the following facts favorably : 1 . Commercial support for the station was shown to be probable ( 1 FCC 267 ) . 2 . Local talent and program material were shown to be available ( 1 FCC 259 ) 3 . Previous experience in broadcasting indicated applicant was able to render a meritorious service ( 1 FCC 253 ) . 4 . Applicant had engaged an experienced staff ( 1 FCC 244 ) . 5 . Programs proposed were suited to local needs and would constitute a complete and diversified service ( 1 FCC 212 ) . Over the years such refinements as these have become well established as criteria of selection . These elements of fine differentiation are usually found in ( 1 ) the character of the program service proposed ( together with the assurances that proposals will really be carried out ) ; and in ( 2 ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the local community to be served . PROGRAM CRITERIA As to the program service , the Commission stresses the need for a " balanced " or " well-rounded " service , with emphasis on local needs . The meaning of " balanced " in this context has been defined by the Commission in the Blue Book . ' According to this interpretation , a responsible broadcast service // should include ( 1 ) sustaining programs , ( 2 ) local live programs , ( 3 ) discussions of public issues . At the same time , programming should avoid advertising excesses , both quantitative ( e.g. , the piling up of commercials ) and qualitative ( commercial exploitation of patriotic feelings , commercials of doubtful taste concerning bodily functions , commercials which propagandize on social issues instead of selling goods and services ) According to the Blue Book , sustaining programs are essential for several reasons : Some types of desirable programs are not appropriate for commercial sponsorship : significant minorities should be served and yet may not be attractive advertising targets : non-profit organizations should have an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programming ( advertisers being notoriously averse to risking untried program formulas ) . But perhaps the most significant role of sustaining programs is what the FCC called their " balance-wheel function . " This often-misunderstood concept merely takes into account the fact that purely commercial considerations tend to limit program choice . It does not assume that commercial programs are necessarily crass , vulgar , and lacking in public-interest value or that sustaining programs are , by the same token , necessarily uplifting and impeccably artistic . This would he a patently absurd conclusion . The balance-wheel function of sustaining programs simply means that commercial criteria of choice should not be the only criteria , irrespective of the kind of programs which may result from commercial motivations . Conceivably every sponsor might want classical music , in which case counterbalancing sustaining programs might be designed to serve those who are interested in popular music , folk music , or no music at all.F Local live programs derive their importance , in the FCC 's view , from the Communications Act requirement of equitable distribution of service . // " Service " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broadcast signal to receivers in a community but also the availability of a broadcast station for the local self-expression of a community . The FCC emphasizes the use of local facilities as well as reception from local facilities . Discussions of public issues , the third major aspect of public service mentioned in the Blue Book , reflect the Commission 's concern that broadcasting should be utilized as a medium for disseminating ideas and opinions as well as facts and entertainment . This concern has its roots , of course , in the libertarian philosophy of communication discussed in Chapter 20 . Licensees are expected not merely to accept programs dealing with public issues but to seek out such programs actively . Another clue to the Commission 's concept of program balance can be inferred from the content categories used in application forms for construction permits and license renewals . Proposed or actual programs must be classified as follows : 1 . Entertainment ( programs intended primarily as entertainment , such as music , drama , variety , comedy , quiz , breakfast , children 's ) 2 . Religious ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 3 . Agricultural ( farm or market reports and other information addressed directly to the agricultural population ) 4 . Educational ( programs prepared by or in behalf of educational organizations , exclusive of discussion programs ) 5 . News ( including commentaries ) 6 . Discussion ( including forum , panel , and round-table programs ) 7 . Talks ( conversation programs not previously classified ; includes sports ) 8 . Miscellaneous . This breakdown has several points of interest : ( 1 ) The FCC 's choice of non-entertainment categories reveals the types of program it considers to be important for appraisal of programming balance ; ( 2 ) no distinction is made between commercial and sustaining programs ; ( 3 ) educational programs are so defined as to require participation by educational organizations ; and ( 4 ) no norms for relative amounts of each program type are suggested . Another tabulation requires a breakdown of total programming into the following categories : figure Again , it should be noted that this analysis does not reveal the extent to which any particular type of program is commercialized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type must be broadcast . In none of the q anti- i // tative tests of programming is the licensee told to meet a predetermined standard . The criterion in each case is what is " reasonable " under the circumstances . A rural station which supplies the only daytime service to its community , for example , might reasonably be expected to offer a very different kind of programming from that of a station which is one of fifteen or twenty operating in a metropolitan area . The program analyses called for by the FCC do not include a category identified as " public service " programs ; nor do they invidiously separate programs of any given content-category into sustaining sheep and commercial goats . The term " public service " is used ambiguously in the industry ; it is sometimes applied to all types of non-entertainment programs , sometimes to all non-commercial programs , sometimes to only some of each type . In any case the phrase is unfortunate , for it implies that only some programs are intended to serve the public . Programs of pure entertainment surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do programs of pure information , instruction , or uplift in theirs . The legitimate and valuable recreational function of broadcasting has been relegated , by implication , to an inferior position . In any event , our hypothetical applicant should submit a proposed program schedule with due regard to over-all balance and to serving local interests . He can further bolster his case by including assurances that these proposals actually reflect the needs of the community in which he plans to operate and actually have a chance of realization . Appropriate evidence might include surveys of community needs and resources ; letters showing that local talent , community leaders , educational authorities , and others have agreed to cooperate ; specific formats , descriptions , and budgets for the proposed programs . OWNERSHIP CRITERIA Emphasis on availability of local broadcast facilities for reception and for use naturally leads to consideration of certain ownership factors . For example , an applicant has an advantage if he can demonstrate that he has participated actively and personally in the life of the community ; a past history of service in charitable drives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects argues that he will be likely to understand and serve the needs of the locality . Similarly , an applicant who can show that he is going to participate directly and personally in station management has an advantage over one who plans merely to sit back and collect profits earned by hired hands . Integration of ownership and management tends to assure the Commission that the professed objectives of the owner will be carried out conscientiously in clay-to-day operation . If the applicant is a corporation it is advantageous to show that the stockholders are local residents and represent diversified interests in the community . Local ownership integrated with management // suggests that the licensee will have a real , personal stake in the community he proposes to serve and therefore will be more willing and better able to render a genuine public service to that particular community than owners for whom the station is simply an impersonal investment . Another aspect of ownership involves the question of monopoly . There is no prospect of any single owner 's establishing a national monopoly in broadcasting , since the FCC can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , from ownership and control of syndicating agencies ( e.g. , networks ) rather than ownership of stations . Of course each station license grants the licensee a local monopoly on a particular channel ; where the local economy can support only one station or where only one broadcast channel is available for allocation , the licensee obtains a complete local monopoly . This is a " natural " monopoly situation ; the FCC forestalls the artificial creation of these situations through the " duopoly " rule , which prevents a single licensee from controlling more than one station in any given service area . The monopoly issue becomes more complex when the applicant for a broadcast license is already the owner of other communications media . The owner of the only daily newspaper in a community would be at a great disadvantage in a competitive hearing for the only broadcasting channel allocated to that community . If he applied for one of several available channels his newspaper monopoly would still be a point against him , but its significance would depend on his other qualifications and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this arises from the doctrine of " diversification of control of the mass media , " which is derived from the libertarian theory . Diversification of control does not , however , override all other considerations . Experience in broadcasting or in newspaper operation can be cited to the advantage of an applicant ; a good record of public service is better than no record at all . // Our hypothetical applicant 's first formal step would he to submit an application for a Construction Permit . The application ( Form 301 ) requires a recital of the facilities applied for , the qualifications of the applicant , proposed financing , proposed programming , and engineering data . Although the form itself is relatively brief , the supporting exhibits may reach formidable proportions . Television applications not uncommonly grow to a stack of documents four or five feet high , since the applicant who faces cross examination from rival applicants can expect to be quizzed in the minutest detail . He must show that every inch of his studios has been // properly designed , every iota of necessary equipment listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , equipment , personnel , and content material . Once the hearing stage has been reached , it is too late to correct mistakes ; the application must stand or fall on its merits . Opposing legal , engineering , and program experts study it from every possible angle , seeking even the smallest oversight which may serve to embarrass a witness on the stand . Both the applicant himself and the key personnel he may have already engaged are subjected to searching examination . The applicant , in particular , must expect that any flaw in his character or past conduct may be produced to support the contention that he is not the one best fitted to operate in the public interest , convenience , and necessity . In short , the broadcast applicant in a competitive hearing must be prepared to have his whole life laid hare , his character examined , his financial position analyzed , his motives appraised , his plans minutely dissected , his technical competence challenged . If our hypothetical applicant survives the hearings , the initial decision , the exceptions , the oral argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rehearing or a court appeal on the decision ) , he is ready to begin construction . He pays no license fee , either for the CP or the station license , ' but the costs of preparing an application and participating in all the proceedings connected with a competitive hearing run to many thousands of dollars . In fact , the amount of money and time consumed in hearings has been investigated by Congress , and a number of steps have been taken to simplify the proceedings.10 Nevertheless , an applicant must still be prepared to risk a very considerable outlay for legal and engineering consultants ' fees , preparing and duplicating elaborate exhibits , purchasing transcripts of hearings , and transporting and maintaining witnesses in Washington . He must also be prepared to face delays which may run into years.15 The would-he licensee ( or applicant for a change in an existing license ) may have to face competition from still another source . An existing licensee who can claim that his interests would be adversely affected by a decision or rule of the FCC may appeal the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic injury , has already been mentioned in connection with the Sanders Brothers case in Chapter 21 . In this case the Supreme Court ruled that the Commission has to consider the economic injury that // the granting of a new license might cause to a current licensee only insofar as public interest , convenience , and necessity may be involved . Another type of injury that an existing station may anticipate from a new station is loss of coverage due to signal interference . The issue involved in such a circumstance has produced more litigation and legal quibbling than any other single issue in broadcasting law . The classic example , the KOA case , resulted in seventeen judges ' writing ten different opinions , of which five were on one side and five on the other . KOA is a Class I-A clear-channel station in Denver that was once owned by NBC . The Commission , by a bare majority , proposed to grant a modification of license for WHDH on the same channel in Boston , changing it from one kilowatt daytime to five kilowatts unlimited time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide separation of the two stations , because it represented an encroachment on the clear-channel principle . The Commission was finally allowed to make the change , and subsequently granted WHDH fifty kilowatts.12 KEEPING A LICENSE Assuming our imaginary applicant has surmounted all obstacles and finally become a full-fledged broadcast licensee , what must he do to keep his hard-won privilege ? Fundamentally , of course , he must operate in the public interest , convenience , and necessity . More specifically , he must abide by the operating rules of the FCC , submit required periodic reports on ownership , finances , and programming , and remember to apply for a renewal of license every three years . In 1952 an amendment to the Communications Act gave the FCC a new method of dealing with violations by licensees , the cease-and-desist order ( Sec. 312 b ) . Before that time the Commission 's only way of penalizing a station had been to jeopardize the license itself , by either a revocation or a renewal proceeding . This meant , in effect , that there was no punishment available short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invoke this penalty : ... we go through long hearings , but when you get right down to it the penalty is so severe that the Commission is not inclined to do anything about it . The upshot of it is that ultimately they try to get the thing straightened out and let it go right ahead , and I do n't know whether that is a healthy thing.13 The record of the Commission shows that there are very few revocations and very few denials of licenses since it does not wish to impose this harsh remedy . // The Commission is of the opinion that the Broadcasting industry believes it can get away with almost anything because the Commission will not revoke their licenses or deny an application for renewal.14 The cease-and-desist order provides an intermediate step . Such more substantial penalties as fines or temporary suspensions of operations are not feasible , since they would tend to penalize the public ( in terms of deterioration or loss of program service ) as much as the broadcaster . It seems likely , however , that the Commission will continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cease-and-desist orders ( like revocations ) can issue only for specific violations , whereas renewals can be set for hearing on the general question of whether public interest , convenience , or necessity would be served by renewal . Information or evidence on which the FCC might set a renewal application for hearing could come from ( 1 ) citations for infractions of the rules or ( 2 ) the logs of the station , which may reveal violations of the law or suggest failure to operate in the public interest . In addition , ( 3 ) the program and financial reports of the station , which the FCC requires to be filed regularly , may contain similar revelations ; ( 4 ) complaints may have been lodged against the station by individuals or organizations ; or ( 5 ) the licensee may have been found guilty of . some kind of unlawful conduct that is not under the immediate jurisdiction of the FCC but diminishes his ability to operate in the public interest . The FCC does not itself monitor programs to evaluate their content . The chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such its unauthorized radiations or signals , or failure to maintain assigned frequency and prescribed signal characteristics . Inspections of stations also are primarily concerned with compliance with technical rules . Questions of program content usually come to the attention of the Commission as the result of complaints or local legal actions incidental to programming . Audience members may either write directly to the FCC or seek action through their Congressmen . Many complaints can be classified as crank letters and given routine answers ; others can be handled informally by correspondence between the FCC and the station involved ; if complaints seem substantial and serious , they can lead to punitive action . ' ' Section 309 of the Act requires the Commission first to notify the licensee of the reasons for questioning renewal and then to consider the licensee 's reply to this notice . If the reply does not satisfy the Commission , it may then set the matter for // hearing , at which the burden of proof is upon the applicant ( rather than upon the Commission , as in revocation proceedings ) . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promising to mend his ways , whereupon the Commission has granted renewal . This procedure has been criticized because the licensee , in order not to risk losing his license altogether , tends to accept the Commission 's ruling without submitting it to a court test . Thus , conceivably , the licensee 's legal rights could be lost by default . As long as the licensee knuckles under and agrees to change his ways he tacitly admits he was wrong and therefore has no grounds for appeal . Only when he refuses to change his ways and invites the FCC to deny license renewal does the licensee have a case . Most licensees do not want to undertake the expense of an appeal to the courts at the risk of losing their cases and with them their licenses . Probably the most notable instance of this sort of " judicial legislation " by the FCC is the Mayflower case . A Boston station , WAAB , owned by the Yankee Network , adopted a policy of " editorializing , " i.e. , expressing views on political candidacies and other controversial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This practice is to be distinguished from expression of such views by commentators ; it corresponds to editorializing in newspapers , where the editorials represent the views of the publisher . The Commission took the view that such editorializing was not in the public interest , holding that " a truly free radio can not be used to advocate the causes of the licensee . It can not be used to support the candidacies of his friends . It can not be devoted to the support of principles he happens to regard most favorably . In brief , the broadcaster can not be an advocate . " " ' The Yankee Network submitted affidavits showing that it had discontinued its editorializing practices and would never revive them in the future , in consideration of which the Commission renewed the license . This established that the FCC had the power to prevent a licensee from editorializing . That " the broadcaster can not be an advocate " became , in effect , the law without ever having been challenged . The decision caused so much resentment throughout the industry that the Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licensee , provided that the licensee allows opposing points of view an opportunity to be expressed . " T LOSING A LICENSE Renewal has been denied only in rather extreme cases , usually those in volving specific violations rather than failures in the " vagueish " area of // public interest , convenience , and necessity . The following examples of decisions made after renewal hearings illustrate the difference : RENEWAL GRANTED Inspector found transmitter being operated by unlicensed operator ( 2 FCC 51 ) . Station discontinued objectionable programs in one of which analyses of dreams and advice on love , marriage , business , and various other subjects were given ; technical flaws had been due to transmitter repairs ; evidence of failure to identify transcriptions according to rule was conflicting ( 4 FCC 125 ) . Broadcast of alleged lottery advertising discontinued after few days ( 4 FCC 186 ) . Station had been cited a number of times for violation of technical rules and failure to keep log properly ; it had briefly carried a program by an astrologer ( 7 FCC 219 ) . RENEWAL DENIED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one by a marriage broker , technical equipment was in very poor repair , management 's financial affairs were in very poor condition , station had engaged in unethical business practice ( 2 FCC 209 ) . Station 's service had been interrupted owing to faulty equipment ; time brokerage was permitted ; misrepresentation in advertising was condoned ( 4 FCC 521 ) . Licensee transferred control of station in violation of law , made false representations to the Commission , was not financially qualified to continue operation ( 8 FCC 434 ) . Out-and-out revocation of the license under Section 312 of the Communications Act is rare . This section specifies the grounds for revocation as : ( 1 ) false statements in an application , ( 2 ) " conditions coming to the attention of the Commission which would warrant it in'refusing to grant a license or permit on an original application " ; ( 3 ) " wilful or repeated failure to operate substantially as set forth in the license , " ( 4 ) similar violation of the Act , Rules and Regulations , or treaties ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these grounds are , they do not encompass everything the Commission has included under " public interest , convenience , and necessity . " Moreover , Section 312 places the burden of proof on the Commission . I-fence licenses have more frequently been jeopardized and actually lost under Section 307 , which provides for renewal of licenses . TRANSFERRING A LICENSE In the event that our imaginary licensee decides to withdraw from the hroadcasting hnsiness , an interesting question arises : Since the licensee does not own the license , how can he sell it . Of course he may own the technical equipment , buildings , and land necessary to the operation of the // station , but all this property greatly enhances in value by virtue of its use in a broadcasting business . The station as a going concern is worth much more than the aggregate value of its individual parts . The actual sale prices of stations often amount to ten and even twenty and more times the value of the inventory of the physical property involved . Part of the difference may be chargeable to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the value of the license itself , or , more accurately , the right to use a particular broadcast channel which the license confers . In a large market with a limited number of VHF television channels , the right to use a particular channel may be worth literally millions of dollars . The fact that licenses have cash value on the market , even though they do not represent " ownership " of a broadcast channel , has led to applications for CP 's and erection of stations as pure business speculations . This " trafficking in licenses " presents a problem to the FCC , for although it is not illegal it directly contravenes the theory of the Communications Act . The Act assumes that a man who applies for a broadcast license does so with the thought of rendering a public service ; it makes no acknowledgment of the fact that a man might build a station for the sake of a quick and profitable sale , with no real intention of serving the public . Nor does it contemplate that broadcast stations might become mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problem was pointed up by a hearing on the transfer of WLW , Cincinnati , to the Aviation Corporation ( Aveo ) . WLW was licensed to Crosley Corporation , an old-line electronics manufacturing concern . Avco , a large holding company with many subsidiaries , was buying the Croslev Corporation , and the broadcast properties of Crosley were mere incidentals in the $22,000,000 transaction . The transfer was approved by a hare majority of the FCC , which took occasion to remark that more than 50 per cent of the existing licensees at that time ( 1945 ) had been selected not by the Commission but by transferors . The FCC minority dissent pointed out that Avco 's officers demonstrated serene and unblushing ignorance of the most elementary facts about broadcasting , the Communications Act , and the obligations they were proposing to undertake ; the Commissioners added that even an applicant for the lowest grade of operator 's license has to pass a test to show that he understands his duties and responsibilities under the Act . Programming is the essence of broadcasting and yet not a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the kind of program service which would be rendered , the availability of program talent and sources , the needs of the people in WLW 's service area , or even about the type of program service being rendered under the previous management . They did not even know how much they were paying for the broadcasting facilities being purchased . " // This case led to the adoption by the FCC of the " Ave() rule , " which required that stations offered for sale be advertised and competing bids solicited , so that the FCC could choose the best qualified applicant . In the four years of the Avco Rule relatively few competing bids were entered and usually the original purchaser was approved anyway . In 1949 the Commission repealed the rule . It now requires filing of application for transfer sixty days in advance of the proposed transfer date.19 Such extreme cases as the Avco transfer can be more readily prevented by the Commission under a 1952 amendment to Sec. 310 ( b ) of the Communications Act . Previously the licensee had merely to secure written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide whether public interest would be served by the proposed transfer . The amended section requires the same action on an application for transfer as on an original application for a license . This amendment prevents the consequence complained of by the majority in the Ave() decision ? the choice of licensees by transferors instead of by the Commission . CONSISTENCY IN FCC DECISIONS Applicants and their lawyers wish the FCC would be more consistent in its interpretations and hence more predictable in its decisions . In his analysis of broadcast law Harry P. Warner reverts again and again to the same theme ? " irreconcilable conflict in the decisions on this topic . , " " patent inconsistency throughout the decisions on this topic . , " " Commission 's decisions are in hopeless confusion . . . " 20 He concludes : The standard of performance of the FCC in dealing with the social , economic and political phases of broadcasting does not measure up to the Commission 's expertise on technical matters . This can be attributed for the most part to the broad gaps in statute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , convenience and necessity , and the failure of Congress to provide definite policies which can be interpreted and applied by the Commission.21 The failure of Congress to fill in gaps and provide policies can only be interpreted as deliberate , for Congress has amended the Communications Act many times yet has never chosen either to define public interest , convenience , and necessity or to inhibit the Commission with more rigid policies . The Commission , in turn , has been reluctant to set up hard-and-fast standards . To do so would almost certainly hamper the development of the media of communication in the long run . A standard which is reasonable // and appropriate here today might he unreasonable or inappropriate either elsewhere today or here tomorrow ; therefore the Commission has proceeded largely on a case-by-case basis . Take newspaper ownership and the doctrine of diversification of massmedia control as an example . What weight should the fact of newspaper ownership have in a comparative hearing ? Should it count for or against an applicant ? Study of the hearings in which newspaper ownership has been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ownership was the controlling factor , in others an incidental factor ; in some cases it counted against the applicant , in others for the applicant . These apparent inconsistencies arise because , as one Commission Chairman has said , " to get at the question of what public interest is , you must have before you a set of facts in a particular case ; because all of the aspects of the public interest that may have arisen in a particular case before the Commission will probably not arise in any other single case . " 22 This case-by-case method seems the most workable one available in a dynamic field such as that governed by the FCC . It is not a method which appeals to the legal mind . However , the FCC , though quasi-judicial in function , is not a court of law ; it is not bound to the same extent as a court by the rule of stare decisis , which constrains courts to harmonize new decisions with those that went before . However , the Commission 's freedom from the restraints of formal consistency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraints of fact and logic . The Court of Appeals has described the essentials for a legally valid decision in a comparative hearing as follows : ( 1 ) The bases or reasons for the final conclusion must be clearly stated . ( 2 ) That conclusion must be a rational result from the findings of ultimate facts , and those findings must be sufficient in number and substance to support the conclusions . ( 3 ) The ultimate facts as found must appear as rational inferences from the findings of basic facts . ( 4 ) The findings of the basic facts must be supported by substantial evidence . ( 5 ) Findings must be made in respect to every difference , except those which are frivolous or wholly unsubstantial , between the applicants indicated by the evidence and advanced by one of the parties as effective . ( 6 ) The final conclusion must be upon a composite consideration of the findings as to the several differences , pro and con each applicant . " HOW IMPARTIAL IS THE FCC ? It will be recalled that the Communications Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any political party to a bare majority of // the Commissioners and by prohibiting Commissioners from having any financial interest in the industry which they regulate . Nevertheless , any political appointee whose decisions affect the disposal of privileges worth many millions of dollars can not escape a multitude of pressures : ... in their own interest as well as in the interest of their constituents , Congressmen themselves form a pressure group , or rather a number of small but intensive pressure groups , influencing , cajoling , threatening , or entreating the regulatory Commission which they have created.24 Congressmen are themselves under constant pressure not only to enlarge the scope of the Communications Act by converting public opinion into law but also to influence specific decisions of the Commission . The broadcasting industry is probably less grateful than it should be for the fact that the Commission has on the whole steadfastly advised against the statutory enlargement of government power , which could easily lead to much more rigid controls than those improvised by the FCC on the basis of existing legislation . The chairman of the House Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio regulation , has asserted that if the Communications Act were to come before Congress today as a new piece of legislation , Congress would be likely to impose far more restrictive regulations on the industry than it did in 1934 . " An intensive study of the political connections of Commissioners and licensees that was made before the era of television failed to uncover evidence of political favoritism : Most of the criticism levelled against the present Commission has been founded on the charge that political considerations have motivated its actions . A study of the actual record does not appear to sustain this charge ... Neither party , despite its most energetic efforts when out of office , has been able to uncover any concrete evidence of narrow partisanship in the Commission 's decisions . . . Even after twelve years of the New Deal , a check of the political sympathies of station owners reveals that the most powerful stations are about equally divided between Republicans and Democrats . " ' More recently the pressures and temptations have mounted because the value of television channels is so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Democratic to a Republican administration in 1952 led to a shift in the balance of power in the Commission . Presumably a Republican-controlled Commission would tend to favor business interests more than one controlled by Democrats . Yet in 1954 a Republican appointee to // the Commission , Robert E. Lee , gave the industry " one of the soundest governmental spankings broadcasters could recall . " 27 AN APPRAISAL The most vociferous criticism of the Commission has naturally come from those whose financial interests have been adversely affected by its decisions . Ironically , a disinterested study of the history of the FRC and the FCC leads to the conclusion that , from an idealistic point of view , their major weakness has been a tendency to compromise principle by making practical concessions to vested economic interests . This compromise began at the very outset , when the FRC failed to wipe the slate clean and start afresh , as it was entitled to do under the Radio Act of 1927 . This would have meant arbitrarily putting hundreds of stations off the air and redistributing the service equitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the expense of many of the pioneer broadcasters , who , though having no legal right to retain their advantageous position , had a certain moral right by virtue of their priority . The FRC chose to avoid taking drastic measures , with the result that the clear-channel problem has plagued the Commission ever since . There have been many subsequent instances in which the Commission recognized desirable policies in principle but temporized in their application . In every case the striking departures from declared policy have occurred with respect to policies which , if rigorously enforced , might reduce somewhat the profitability of broadcast operation . It is highly unlikely that commissioners have permitted this consideration to enter into decisions in individual cases . It is rather the belief of the writer that at the root of the difficulty is the milieu in which the Commission operates . The Commission is brought into contact largely with the industry it regulates and very little with representatives of the listening public , whose interests it has declared to be synonymous with the public interest in the broadcasting field . At a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offer argument ? regularly , forcefully , and with a show of massed strength . The industrial giants in this field have , moreover , shown marked ability and determination to organize pressure on Capitol Hill , on the Commission , in the press , and over the radio whenever it has appeared to them that a proposed or promulgated Commission policy would affect their interests adversely . Groups that represent listeners are rare , and those that do arise have become impotent with impressive regularity . Under these circumstances it would be remarkable if there were not a disposition on the part of the Commission to overlook , in concrete cases , what common sense dictates as constituting the public interest in the abstract . Perspective is likely to become distorted . The listener is likely to seem as abstract as the principles which announce his rights . " // In appraising the work of the FRC and the FCC we must bear in mind , on the other hand , the extraordinary complexity and difficulty of the tasks they faced . Here was an attempt to entrust to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting the problem of the disparity between technical advance and its social control that has so consistently plagued modern man . Until the establishment of the Atomic Energy Commission , the Communications Commission 's program constituted our only significant venture of this kind . ' Under the circumstances some mistakes were inevitable , errors in judgment unavoidable , injustices likely . Taking the long view of the whole development of broadcasting under the FRC and the FCC , an objective appraiser must conclude that the results in terms of the general public interest have been on the whole good . To be sure , the advantage of hindsight enables us now to see mistakes . If the Commission had had foreknowledge of the outcome would it willingly have created the muddled television post-freeze allocation plan ? Now that we know the results it is easy to find fault ; but a reading of the numerous hearings and reports which led up to the plan reveals such conflicting testimony , such evidence of intense and contradictory pressures on the Commission , that the wonder is that we have a reasonably workable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been all too easy for the Commission to yield to the impatient clamor of ill-informed Congressmen and self-seeking industrialists and to saddle the country with an inflexible set of regulations and inferior technical standards . 23 Regulation : Enemy of Freedom Most of the significant controversies surrounding the regulation of broadcasting involve in one way or another the principle of free speech and press . Interference with this fundamental liberty is interdicted by the First Amendment to the Constitution : Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble , and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances . ' Generally regarded as the most precious article of the American Bill of Rights , the First Amendment occupies a preferred position which gives it " a sanctity and a sanction not permitting dubious intrusions . " As justice Holmes put it , " . . . if there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought ? not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought we hate . " 3 THE THEORY OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT Justice Douglas , in an eloquently argued dissent , has recently restated the rationale of the First Amendment : Free speech has occupied an exalted position because of the high service it has given our society . Its protection is essential to the very existence of a democracy . The airing of ideas releases pressures which otherwise might become destructive . When ideas compete in the market for acceptance , full and free discussion exposes the false and they gain few adherents . Full and free discussion even of ideas we hate encourages the testing of our own prejudices and preconceptions . Full and free discussion keeps a society The First Amendment restricts only the federal government , but the Fourteenth Amendment extends the prohibitions of the federal Constitution to the state governments . In addition , all the state constitutions contain provisions similar to those of the First Amendment . // from becoming stagnant and unprepared for the stresses and strains that work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has indeed been the first article of our faith . We have founded our political system on it . It has been the safeguard of every religious , political , philosophical , economic , and racial group amongst us . We have counted on it to keep us from embracing what is cheap and false ; we have trusted the common sense of our people to choose the doctrine true to our genius and to reject the rest . This has been the one single outstanding tenet that has made our institutions the symbol of freedom and equality . We have deemed it more costly to liberty to suppress a despised minority than to let them vent their spleen . We have above all else feared the political censor . We have wanted a land where our people can he exposed to all the diverse creeds and cultures of the world.4 No writer in the libertarian tradition has been more persuasive than the English philosopher John Stuart Mill . " If all mankind minus one , " he wrote , " were of one opinion , and only one person were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justified in silencing that one person , than he , if he had the power , would be justified in silencing mankind . " He goes on : ... the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is , that it is robbing the human race ; posterity as well as the existing generation ; those who dissent from the opinion , still more than those who hold it . If the opinion is right , they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth : if wrong , they lose , what is almost as great a benefit , the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth , produced by its collision with error . ' Living up to this ideal is not easy : no one has difficulty in recognizing the importance of freedom for himself , but it requires an unusual measure of self-restraint and tolerance always to grant the importance of that same freedom to those with whom we violently disagree . " The last acquisition of civilized man , " Justice Learned Hand has remarked , " is forbearance in judgment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will . " " We tend to assume that we have already arrived at our destination , to " think that new truths may have been desirable once , but that we have had enough of them now . " 4 Our natural egocentricity ( not to speak of ethnocentricity ) persuades us that we in our time and our place have reached the pinnacle . From this conviction arises the presumption that it is necessary to maintain the status quo at all costs and the fatal delusion that it is possible to attain total security . But , as Justice Holmes has said , " all life is an experiment " : ... when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths , they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free // trade in ideas ? that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market , and that truth is the only ground upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rate is the theory of the constitution . It is an experiment , as all life is an ex-periments CENSORABLE FORMS OF EXPRESSION The constitutional prohibition on censorship leaves room for no exceptions : " Congress shall make no law . . . " The admonition is absolute . Yet it can not be taken with complete literalness , for some modes of expression are properly subject to penalty , notably obscenity , defamation , and treason . This paradox is resolved by considering that the benefits of free speech can be realized only in an organized society . " The hermit is free to sing , but not to sing in a chorus or an opera . " It follows that the use of freedom to destroy the conditions necessary to its enjoyment is self-defeating . Words which have this destructive effect are not exempt from punishment : " The very utterance of such words is considered to inflict a present injury upon listeners , readers , or those defamed , or else to render highly probable an immediate breach of the peace . This is a very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to cause a future danger to the State . " Y0 Let us take the case of obscenity . It is presumed to have an immediate and harmful effect on society . Legally defined , obscenity means " tending to stir sex impulses or lead to sexually impure and lustful thoughts . " l The test is that of the effect on a normal , reasonable man . In a given instance opinions could differ , but the courts have held that obscenity is not unconstitutionally vague and that its suppression is proper exercise of the police powers of the government . Nevertheless , the subjectivity of the concept of obscenity leaves a loophole for the unwarranted censorship of literature and art . The supporters of individual liberties fight a constant battle against those who profess to find obscenity in the nudity in paintings by the masters and in the realism of literary classics . ' " An important decision in this connection was made in 1933 in the case of James Joyce 's Ulysses . It established the principle that a literary work must be judged as a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ; Without this safeguard the censor can take a word , phrase , sentence , or passage out of context , declare it obscene , and suppress the // whole work . A similar technique is often used to condemn books as subversive or Communistic on the basis of isolated passages torn out of context . Like obscenity , speech which is grossly defamatory or likely to lead to an immediate breach of the peace is legally preventable because of the immediate and lasting harm it can cause . If there were no way of punishing slander or libel , no man would be safe from false defamations which could easily cause loss of job and social standing . If there were no way for the state to protect itself , seditious utterances could precipitate riots and revolution . These examples of admittedly proper and necessary exceptions to the First Amendment might lead to the conclusion that the distinction between the kinds of speech it protects and the kinds it does not protect hinges on whether or not a given utterance will cause harm to others . In other words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as he caused no injury to other persons ; he would be subject to punishment only for saying anything which hurt others . THE RIGHT TO DEFAME This test , however , oversimplifies the problem . Indeed , it tends to abolish freedom of speech at the very times when it may be most necessary . One of the most effective ways of ascertaining whether or not genuine freedom of speech exists is to criticize those in power ? if necessary , to criticize them harshly and vociferously . Is an office-holder believed to be dishonest , incompetent , ignorant , lazy , unprincipled ? If so , there must be an opportunity for publicly exposing him . Even if the accusations are false , there should at least be an opportunity to bring them into the light and test them . It is significant that the first act of a dictator on seizing power is forcibly to suppress freedom of the opposition to criticize his regime . The right to censure is inseparable from a democratic system . In fact , one commentator goes so far as to assert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defame . " ' Those who closely identify their interests with the status quo usually interpret any criticism of the status quo as an injury . History is replete with examples of ideas which when first introduced seemed to those in power intolerably wrong , radical , subversive , or impious ? in short , dangerously injurious ; yet in the course of time these same ideas have turned out to be none of these things and have come , indeed , to be accepted with perfect equanimity . These are the occasions , says Mill , on which the men of one generation commit those dreadful mistakes which excite the astonishment and horror of posterity . It is among such that we find the instances memorable in history , when the arm of the law has been employed to root out the best men and the noblest doctrines ; with deplorable success as to the non , though some of the doctrines have survived to be ( as // if in mockery ) invoked in defence of similar conduct towards those who dissent from them , or from their received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not enough merely to tolerate those ideas which at the moment seem safe and harmless and to suppress those which seem dangerous and harmful . This theory of the First Amendment could only defeat its real purpose . Freedom of speech is not an unloaded gun ; it must aim at securing results , and those results may well be painful to the target . If a malicious or unwarranted injury occurs , laws such as those of slander or libel provide redress ; but this remedy must follow after , not come before to prevent the very utterance ; and if truth can be proved the injury is warranted . THE " CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER " TEST Two methods have been proposed for distinguishing forms of speech protected by the First Amendment from those not so protected . One is based on the consequences of speech , the other on the content of speech . The former theory , developed explicitly by Holmes and Brandeis in a series of notable Supreme Court cases which followed the first World War , is the " clear and present danger " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holmes in 1919 . The case involved a wartime attempt to obstruct the military draft by means of a circular intended to incite direct resistance . Said Holmes : We admit that in many places and in ordinary times the defendants in saying all that was said in the circular would have been within their constitutional rights . But the character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done . . . The question in every case is whether the words used are used in such circumstances and are of such a nature as to create a clear and present danger that they will bring about the substantive evils that Congress has a right to prevent . It is a question of proximity and degree . " In subsequent cases Holmes and Brandeis elaborated on this principle , emphasizing repeatedly that in order to justify suppression a danger must be both very apparent and very immediate . In 1927 Brandeis expressed it this way : Those who won our independence by revolution were not cowards . They did not fear political change . They did not exalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-reliant men , with confidence in the power of free and fearless reasoning applied through the processes of popular government , no danger flowing from speech can be deemed clear and present , unless the incidence of the evil apprehended is so imminent that it may befall before there is opportunity/ for full discussion . If there be time to expose through // discussion the falsehood and fallacies , to avert the evil by the processes of education , the remedy to be applied is more speech , not enforced silence.17 The " clear and present danger " theory gained ground until after World War II . The security-conscious , fear-ridden atmosphere of the subsequent " cold war " period , however , was not hospitable to this interpretation of the First Amendment . Many Americans grew less confident of the outcome of full discussion , more apprehensive that evil would befall before discussion could take place . An important Supreme Court decision in 1951 seems to retreat from the Holmes-Brandeis position . In the Dennis case the Court upheld the Smith Anti-Subversive Act , under which Communist party leaders in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous dissents to the majority opinion . The Dennis case brought into sharp focus the outstanding political problem of our times ? that of how Democracy can combat Communism without sacrificing the very things sought to be preserved . The freedom-of-speech issue in this case was whether the accused could be found guilty on the basis of things said which did not represent a clear and present danger to the country , as this phrase had been generally understood , but instead an indirect and relatively remote danger . Justice Douglas remarked that the tendency of the majority opinion was to make freedom of speech turn not on what is said , but on the intent with which it is said . Once we start down that road we enter territory dangerous to the liberties of every citizen . " 19 Justice Black said flatly : " No matter how it is worded , this is a virulent form of prior censorship of speech and press , which I believe the First Amendment forbids . . . the only way to affirm these convictions is to repudiate directly or indirectly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice Douglas used the occasion to restate the underlying libertarian concepts quoted earlier in this chapter . It might be argued , in opposition to justice Black , that the majority decision in the Dennis case represents not so much a repudiation of the clearand-present-danger test as a new conception of how " clear " and how " present " the danger has to be . This , at any event , points up a theoretical weakness of the Holmes test : its susceptibility to varying interpretations . Moreover , it admits that under some circumstances no utterance would be exempt from government censorship , despite the unequivocal wording of the First Amendment . The purist position on freedom of speech , on the other hand , insists that there must be some areas which are inviolable , some forms of speech which , no matter what the circumstances , are inherently and inalienably free . // THE INALIENABLE RIGHT TO SPEAK This position is skillfully upheld by Alexander Meiklejohn in a series of lectures on free speech in relation to self-government.21 Meiklejohn makes a distinction between those forms of speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve the needs of a self-governing society . The former he included under the " liberty " mentioned in the Fifth Amendment rather than in the First . The Fifth Amendment prohibits the government from depriving any person of life , liberty , or property without due process of law ( the " due process " clause ) ; " liberty " in this context has been interpreted to include the liberties enumerated in the First Amendment . The Supreme Court has said : The difference between the two amendments is an emphatic one and readily apparent . Deprivation of a liberty not embraced by the First Amendment , as for example the liberty of contract , is qualified by the phrase " without due process of law " ; but those liberties enumerated in the First Amendment are guaranteed without qualification , the object and effect of which is to put them in a category apart and make them incapable of abridgement by any process of law.22 Meiklejohn contends that speech which serves private ends can be legally censored in accordance with due process ; only that speech which serves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The latter is the kind of utterance which has to do with the individual 's functions as a citizen . When the First Amendment says " Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech , " it means that the government may pass a law abridging some forms of speech but the freedom implied can not be abridged under any circumstances . In Meiklejohn 's view there are two sets of civil liberties , only one of which is abridgeable by due process of law ; the other is beyond the reach of the law , belonging to those " inalienable rights " of life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness of which the Declaration of Independence speaks . Like the Holmes doctrine , the doctrine of Meiklejohn stands or falls in practical applications on a question of definition . In the one case someone must say of a specific publication , speech , or other communication : how clear and how present is the danger it presents to the community ? In the other case , given that same communication , someone must say : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area of private , alienable , permissive rights or to the area of public , inalienable , transcendent rights ? Either test will work satisfactorily some of the time ; neither will work to everyone 's satisfaction all of the time . // That some forms of speech do not rise in importance to the level of deserving the protection of the First Amendment has been judicially noted . Advertising matter , for example , being intended entirely for the private profit of the advertiser , has been held to be a form of expression not entitled to protection from censorship under the First Amendment . An interesting case in point established that an advertiser using an illegal advertisement could not claim immunity through the device of printing the advertisement in conjunction with a discussion of a public issue which of itself would be protected by the First Amendment.2a WHAT IS INCLUDED IN " THE PRESS " ? On the other hand , this does not mean that the only communications protected by the First Amendment are serious discussions of social or political issues . The modern mass media have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors of the Constitution . At first there was doubt whether motion pictures , for example , should be considered a form of " the press " and therefore entitled to the protection of the First Amendment . In a significant decision made in 1915 , the Supreme Court upheld an Ohio court in excluding motion pictures from the concept of " the press . " The Ohio court held motion pictures to be mere " spectacles , " saying : It can not be put out of view that the exhibition . of moving pictures is a business pure and simple , originated and conducted for profit , like other spectacles , not to be regarded , nor intended to be regarded by the Ohio constitution , we think , as part of the press of the country or as organs of public opinion.24 The opinion of the court is understandable , considering that it was written at a time when motion pictures were in their infancy . Significantly , however , this litigation coincided with the release of the first motion picture to deal with a social question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left motion pictures vulnerable to government censorship . Attempts to enact federal film-censorship laws failed , but a number of states and many municipalities adopted local censorship measures , the earliest of which was the Pennsylvania law of 1908.22 In 1952 , however , in the Miracle case , the Supreme Court reversed its position of // 1915 . The Miracle is an Italian film which many Catholics in this country found offensive ( although the Catholic church did not ban the film in Italy ) . It was banned in New York under a statute permitting censorship by the state on the grounds of sacrilege . The Supreme Court ruled against that part of the statute , holding : " It is not the business of government in our nation to suppress real or imagined attacks upon a particular religious doctrine , whether they appear in publications , speeches , or motion pictures . " 26 Although the Miracle case was decided on the narrow grounds of the adequacy of " sacrilege " as a basis for censorship and did not therefore rule out existing state and local censorship laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established that motion pictures are to be included under the term " press " in the First Amendment , thereby putting future attacks on film censorship laws on a sound constitutional footing . It was shortly followed by Supreme Court reversals of instances of censorship based on " immorality , " " harmfulness , " and " contribution to racial misunderstanding . " 27 By now it is generally established that all the modern media of communication are to be understood as " the press " as that term is used in the First Amendment . Moreover , the fact that mere entertainment or fiction can be instrumental in conveying ideas has been judicially noted : We do not accede to appellee 's suggestion that the constitutional protection for a free press applies only to the exposition of ideas . The line between the informing and the entertaining is too elusive for the protection of that basic right . Everyone is familiar with instances of propaganda through fiction . What is one man 's amusement , teaches another 's doctrine . Though we can see nothing of any possible value to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the protection of free speech as the best of literature.28 As this decision indicates , a publication or utterance does not have to demonstrate an intrinsic value to society in order to qualify for the protection of the First Amendment . The same doctrine has been applied specifically to broadcasting : the " fact that radio and television giveaway ' programs might have little possible value to society does not deprive the producers of such programs of their constitutional protections of free speech . " 29 In other words , it is the principle of free speech , not merely particular instances of speech , which is protected . // This doctrine results in a situation very familiar in our jurisprudence : not infrequently the guilty go free because we place primary emphasis on protection of the innocent . The presumption of innocence necessarily places all the devices of due process of law ( the right of public trial , protection from self-incrimination , etc. ) at the disposal of the guilty as well . To do otherwise , however , would require presumption of guilt . Similarly , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communications would defeat the purpose of the First Amendment , which is to leave that judgment to each individual recipient of communications . In the Near case the Supreme Court upheld the right of publication of a scandalmongering Minneapolis newspaper which most people would probably agree was hardly deserving , aside from the question of principle , of the protection of the First Amendment . But the Court said that " the fact that the liberty of the press may be abused by miscreant purveyors of scandal does not make any the less necessary the immunity of the press from previous restraints in dealing with official misconduct , " and quoted the well-known words of Madison : Some degree of abuse is inseparable from the proper use of everything , and in no instance is this more true than in that of the press . It has accordingly been decided by the practice of the States , that it is better to leave a few of its noxious branches to their luxurious growth , than by pruning them away , to injure the vigour of those yielding the proper ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contents of communications ( outside the recognized areas of illegal utterance such as obscenity ) points up the weakness of the Meiklejohn theory of the First Amendment . Some forms of communications ( like commercial advertising ) are admittedly private in character and some ( like speeches in a political campaign ) are obviously public . But in the wide middle ground between such extremes it is often impossible to make clear-cut distinctions . Whoever set himself the task of making such distinctions ? the consequence of which would be either to expose utterances to legal censorship or to protect them from such censorship ? would himself become a censor . BROADCASTING DISTINGUISHED FROM " THE PRESS " Turning now to specific consideration of broadcasting in relation to the theory of the First Amendment , let us recall that this medium is explicitly brought within the ambit of the Amendment in the Communications Act itself ( Chapter 21 ) . According to the interpretation of the Amendment discussed in the foregoing pages , this fact should mean that the government as Near v. Minnesota , 283 U.S. ( 697 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things , that a " Jewish gangster was in control of gambling , bootlegging and racketeering in TlinneapcIis , and that law enforcing officers and agencies were not energetically *perforning their duties " ( p. 704 ) . // ( i.e. , the FCC ) is positively forbidden to interfere with the freedom of broadcasters to say anything they like over their stations , with very few exceptions . These exceptions permit the government ( as long as it does not act arbitrarily or capriciously ) to prevent or to modify the broadcasting of ( 1 ) certain specific types of intrinsically injurious material such as obscenity ; ( 2 ) materials presenting a clear and present danger to the state ; and ( 3 ) materials of a purely private nature , i.e. , advertising matter . In actual practice , government regulation goes a long way beyond these limits . As the previous chapters have indicated , the FCC asserts the right to review the whole program service of stations and to take that service into consideration when deciding on license renewals . Moreover , the FCC sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reference to specific types of programs and to the balance among the various types . The FCC 's contention that it avoids censorship because it avoids prior restraint does not hold water , for the Supreme Court has pointed out that post-publication penalties can censor just as effectively as prior restraint . The threat of punishment ( in this case , loss of license ) can hamper freedom of speech almost as rigorously as the censor 's blue pencil . " Immunity from prior restraint . . . can not be deemed to exhaust the conception of the liberty guaranteed by state and federal constitutions. " 31 Government regulation of broadcast programming under the FRC and FCC , had it been applied to newspapers instead of broadcast stations , could never have been successfully defended in the courts . It would certainly have been found unconstitutional at many points . As Caldwell has suggested , broadcasters have lost their licenses for programs far less intemperate and scandalous than the articles in the Minneapolis newspaper which was granted a cloak of immunity by the Supreme Court in the Near case.3 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Commission 's right to control various important aspects of broadcast programming . On the one hand broadcasting is recognized as a form of " the press " that is protected from government interference by the First Amendment ; on the other hand the government interferes with the freedom of the broadcaster to say what he chooses . This contradiction becomes understandable only when it is recognized that the inclusion of broadcasting in the phrase " the press " can not be taken quite literally . For want of another word " press " must do , but this does not mean that broadcasting really is exactly like the press . To be sure , broadcasters have long argued that as far as the First Amendment is concerned they are literally the same thing ( see Chapter 20 ) . The fact remains , however , that broadcasting is inherently different from the printed media and always will be ; mere words can not erase the differences . These distinguishing characteristics of broadcasting have been discussed // hitherto . It will suffice merely to recapitulate them here , together with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectrum ( Chapter 21 ) ; therefore all the people are entitled to a broadcasting service . ( 2 ) There is a limited number of channels available in the spectrum ( Chapter 2 ) ; therefore not everyone who wants to can operate a broadcast station where he wants to , and some basis of choice among applicants is necessary . ; a ( 3 ) The public makes a huge investment in the medium itself ( Chapter 19 ) ; therefore the public as well as the licensee has a property interest to be considered . ( 4 ) Broadcasting is a home medium ; therefore it must observe certain restraints not expected of a medium which is not so intimately a part of home life . ( 5 ) Broadcasting is more accessible to children than any other medium ; therefore it must observe certain restraints not required of other media . " THE ORIGIN OF THE CONCEPT OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST Clearly , broadcasting has special social responsibility , not quite like that of any other medium . This responsibility is implied in the Communications Act by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Neither the term nor the concept originated with broadcasting legislation , however . The term was borrowed from public-utilities law ? a fact which explains the words " convenience " and " necessity . " It is easy to find literal applications of these words in the public-utilities field : a water supply for fighting fires is a public necessity ; considerations of public convenience may dictate the route a transportation line should take . In the field of broadcasting the phrase is taken as a whole for its general implications , but the word " interest " applies most aptly to the broadcasting situation. ; ' The concept of the public interest cropped up almost from the very be- // ginning of discussions of the nature of broadcasting . At the First Radio Conference , in 1922 , Herbert Hoover remarked that " . . . this large mass of subscribers need protection as to the noises which fill their instruments i.e. , radio receivers . " 36 Two years later Hoover testified at a Congressional hearing : Radio communication is not to be considered as merely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or for entertainment of the curious . It is a public concern impressed with the public trust and to be considered primarily from the standpoint of public interest to the same extent and upon the basis of the same general principles as our other public utilities.37 At the Fourth Conference , in 1925 , the National Association of Broadcasters presented a resolution recommending that a law should be enacted making public " convenience and necessity " the basis of choice among competing applications ; a Committee on Operating Regulations mentioned " public interest " as a guide.U6 At that conference Hoover remarked : " We can surely agree that no one can raise a cry of deprivation of free speech if he is compelled to prove that there is something more than naked commercial selfishness in his purpose . " 85 The legislative history of the Radio Act of 1927 makes it apparent that Congress adopted essentially the same point of view . In answer to the NAB 's later contention that the Commission was created merely to regulate technical aspects rather than program aspects of broadcasting , Senator Burton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee that considered the matter at that time , and I do not agree with you that that was the entire idea , just to regulate the physical aspects of radio broadcasting stations . That was not the intention of the Senate . I went through all those hearings at that time , sat as a member of the committee , and it was not the intention of the committee , nor of the Senate , just to regulate these physical things . ' m From the outset the FRC assumed that its supervisory duty definitely included consideration of program service . In its 1929 Annual Report the FRC said : Many programs are still of doubtful value . Offensive sales talks are too common . The attitude of the listening public will tend ultimately to cause the correction of such defects . // The radio act specifies that the commission shall exercise no censorship over programs . Nevertheless , the kind of service rendered by a station must be a means of appraising its relative standing and must be considered by the commission in making assignments.41 JUDICIAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appraisal of programming is not a prohibited form of censorship ? has been converted over the years to a judicially accepted fact . Some examples of the specific requirements of the Commission concerning programming which have been challenged as violations of the First Amendment but upheld in the courts will illustrate . Requirement of balance between commercial and sustaining time . Bay State Beacon , Inc. , lost in a competitive hearing for a Brockton , Mass. , radio channel because , among other things , it proposed to devote less time to sustaining programs than the successful applicant . Bay State proposed to make 80 per cent of its time available for regular commercial sponsorship , 15 per cent for " institutional sponsorship " ( public service agencies charged at half-rates ) , and only 5 per cent for sustaining programs.42 Requirement that licensee affirmatively seek out discussions of controversial public issues . Johnston Broadcasting Company and a rival applicant for a radio channel in Birmingham , Ala. , were substantially equal except that Johnston did not show that " an affirmative effort " to encourage programs dealing with controversial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for " positive action " on this score . Johnston lost primarily on this ground.43 On appeal the Commission was sustained on this point ( though reversed on other grounds ) . The court remarked that ... in a comparative consideration , it is well recognized that comparative service to the listening public is the vital element , and programs are the essence of that service . So , while the Commission can not prescribe any type of program ( except for prohibitions against obscenity , profanity , etc. ) , it can make a comparison on the basis of public interest and , therefore , of public service . Such a comparison of proposals is not a form of censorship within the meaning of the statute.44 Requirement that programming be tailored to the local community . Allen T. Simmons ( WADC ) and another station each applied for a mutually exclusive change to a more desirable frequency and higher power . The Simmons application was rejected because it proposed to carry nothing but network programs from 8 A.M. to 11 P.M. This , said the Commission , // ... is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the duty and responsibility of a broadcast station licensee to determine for itself the nature and character of a program service which will best meet the needs of listeners in its area , but is an abdication to an organization which makes no pretense to scheduling its programs with the particular needs and desires of any one service area in mind.45 Requirement that certain network business practices affecting programs must be changed . This followed from the FCC 's investigation of chain broadcasting , which has been previously cited in several different connections , notably in Chapter 15 . The Supreme Court decision affirming the right of the FCC to regulate contracts between networks and affiliates is the leading case in point and therefore is quoted at length : The Regulations , even if valid in all other respects , must fall because they abridge , say the appellants , their right of free speech . If that be so , it would follow that every person whose application for a license to operate a station is denied by the Commission is thereby denied his constitutional right of free speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use the limited facilities of radio . Unlike other modes of expression , radio inherently is not available to all . That is its unique characteristic , and that is why , unlike other modes of expression , it is subject to governmental regulation . Because it can not be used by all , some who wish to use it must be denied . But Congress did not authorize the Commission to choose among applicants upon the basis of their political , economic or social views , or upon any other capricious basis . If it did , or if the Commission by these regulations proposed a choice among applicants upon some such basis , the issue before us would be wholly different . The question here is simply whether the Commission , by announcing that it will refuse licenses to persons who engage in specified network practices ( a basis for choice which we hold is comprehended within the statutory criterion of " public interest " ) , is thereby denying such persons the constitutional right of free speech . The right of free speech does not include , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a license . The licensing system established by Congress in the Communications Act of 1934 was a proper exercise of its power over commerce . The standard it provided for the licensing of stations was the " public interest , convenience or necessity . " Denial of a station license on that ground , if valid under the Act , is not a denial of free speech.46 The Network case requires further comment , because in it the Supreme Court settled a number of important controversial questions about the regulation of broadcasting but in doing so raised a new problem ? the significance of the phrase " the composition of the traffic " as used by the Court in its decision : The Communications Act itself establishes that the Commission 's powers are not limited to the engineering and technical aspects of regulation of radio // communication . Yet we are asked to regard the Commission as a kind of traffic officer , policing the wave lengths to prevent stations from interfering with each other . But the Act does not restrict the Commission merely to supervision of the traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the composition of that traffic . The facilities of radio are not large enough to accommodate all who wish to use them . Methods must be devised for choosing from among the many who apply . And since Congress itself could not do this , it committed the task to the commission.47 The issue hinges on the meaning of the word " traffic . " It has been widely interpreted to mean " programs , " in which case the Court seems to be saying that the FCC has the responsibility of determining what programs shall be broadcast . This proposition so obviously conflicts with the First Amendment that it seems doubtful that such an interpretation can have been intended by the Supreme Court . A more acceptable interpretation is that " traffic , " in the context , means " stations , " or more accurately " licensees " : the FCC has the responsibility not only of regulating the signals from stations to prevent interference but also of determining who shall be licensed . Commission Chairman Fly put it : " the traffic officer simply guides and controls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licensing authority determines what cars shall compose the traffic , or what cars shall be permitted upon the highways . " 48 Giving the Commission the right to determine who shall be licensed admittedly means that it can exercise an indirect control over programs in general , but does not mean that it can directly censor programs . This type of indirect control seems to have been accepted by the courts as a legitimate form of governmental restriction of freedom of speech in broadcasting . TWO CRUCIAL PUBLIC INTEREST CASES In most cases , as we have already pointed out , when the Commission cites a given program or practice as contrary to the public interest , the station involved voluntarily changes the program or practice and continues in operation . Two cases in which the programs of stations were so extreme as to be directly responsible for loss of licenses may be regarded as particularly significant tests of the Commission 's powers . In both these cases the Corn-
