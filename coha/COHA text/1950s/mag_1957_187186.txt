IN the first half of the 20th century , German art was crushed and twisted by two wars and artistically ignorant totalitarianism . Some of Germany 's artists succumbed to Hitler 's demands , some lost their lives or their minds , many fled to the rest of Europe and the U.S. Today German art is rising out of its ruins , and bringing with it new appreciation of the fact that Germany played a major role in developing what is now the dominant artistic mood : expressionism . <P> The German resurgence is coming to a peak in the U.S. this fall . In Manhattan this week the Museum of Modern Art will open the largest German modern art show to be seen in the U.S. in more than 25 years-178 paintings , sculptures and prints . Next week Boston 's Museum of Fine Arts will open its " European Masters of Our Time " exhibition , including 44 works by modern Germans . Three handsome and scholarly monographs on German 20th century art are now rolling off the presses. * Significantly , the artists most praised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler . <P> A Green Pear Is a Green Pear . The first movement to make expressionism its own was formed by exuberant architectural students turned artists in Dresden in 1905 who called themselves Die Brcke ( The Bridge ) in the confident expectation that they would " attract all the revolutionary and surging elements . " With the " audacious idea of renewing German art " the Bridge group-Ernst Kirchner , Erich Heckel , Karl Schmidt-Rottluff , Fritz Bleyl and later Max Pechstein-set up their studio in an empty shoe store . <P> Recalls Heckel : " We had no patience with the impressionists , who saw the pear in the bowl as having a hundred different shades of green . For us it was a green pear-bang-in a red bowl . We wanted to shock the person who looked at the picture . Looking at one of Kirchners women-on-the-street pictures , he should feel an erotic sensation , or repulsion , in any case some strong nervous response . Looking at one of Schmidt-Rottluffs monumental , somber compositions , he was supposed to feel touched , moved , overwhelmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work among the Bridge group was one of them for only a year and a half : Emil Nolde , a grim north German , who came equipped with " tempests of color . ' ' Driven by what he called an " irresistible desire for a representation of the deepest spirituality , religion and fervor , ' ' Nolde turned to the Gospels , in his Christ Among the Children ( see color page ) created a new and powerful religious art that not only turns its back on the wrung-out humanism of the Renaissance but achieves in its glowing children and astonished disciples a thick religious fervor the equal of Rouault.
