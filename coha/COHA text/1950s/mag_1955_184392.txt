In three evenings a group of American ambassadors scored a triumph for the U.S. that diplomats or dollars have rarely matched . The language was international , and the Americans spoke it eloquently . The successful envoys : the 102 members of the touring Philadelphia Orchestra and Conductor Eugene Ormandy . When Budapest-born , U.S.-naturalized Ormandy and his musicians finished their series of Paris concerts last week , they had a fistful of rave reviews . <P> The Philadelphia , now on its first continental tour , will play in more than a dozen other cities from Lisbon to Helsinki .
