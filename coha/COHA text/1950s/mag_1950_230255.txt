The year 1950 , midpoint of the century , is also the 100th anniversary of the landing of the English sparrows in the U.S. Finicky ornithologists regard the immigrants as neither sparrows nor even especially English . They are weaver finches , originally from Africa , and have made a great success in life by attaching themselves , like the dog , the bedbug and the rat , to the fortunes of man . They colonized Europe long ago , swarming in its cities paved with nutritious refuse . In 1850 they reached Brooklyn . <P> Like other U.S. cities , Brooklyn in those days was plagued by bugs . The shy and decorative native birds did not like city life . As U.S. cities expanded , the birds retired to rural refuges , leaving the shade trees and flower gardens defenseless against insects . Officials of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences discussed the problem at length , finally sent to England for an urban bird : the English sparrow . <P> Promised Land . The first successful colony was established in Greenwood Cemetery , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparrows quickly became well-adjusted Brooklynites , and they found the city a sparrow 's paradise . The streets were strewn with the stable midden of the horse- &-buggy; age , and under each bright streetlight was a discus of dead bugs . <P> The sparrows never had it so good . They applied themselves to multiplication , and soon overflowed Brooklyn . Riding in empty grain cars along the newbuilt railroads , they pioneered the West . By 1886 they had occupied all of the U.S. <P> Soon there were cries of anguish from U.S. bird lovers . The violent , aggressive English sparrows were too successful . Wherever the sparrows came , bluebirds and wrens got out . Audubon Society members reported heartrending sights of native birds being pursued , insulted and pecked by sparrows . <P> Inverse Commuters . The aroused Audubon Society , a dangerous adversary , considered the English sparrow Bird Enemy No. 1 , outranking the feral cat and the small boy with an air rifle . Pamphlets blackened the sparrow 's name . Said Biologist Ned Dearborn of the U.S. Biological Survey : " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is cunning , destructive and filthy . " <P> But by the 19205 the sparrow hosts were already declining , anyhow ; the early years of the century had been their Golden Age . Their downfall was not the Audubon Society , but the automobile . As horses grew scarcer &; scarcer , sparrows grew scarcer too . Now they survive in cities mostly on the leavings of pigeons . <P> In some smaller U.S. cities , sparrows are still plentiful . There they have solved their food problem by a kind of inverse commuting . True to their urban traditions , they build their nests in town . In the mornings they fly out to the country to forage in grainfields and barnyards . Then back they commute , full-fed , for the brawling social life in town .
