At the Newark ( N.J. ) News ( circ. 257,000 ) one day last week , Editor Lloyd M. Felmly studied some advance proofs of the comic strip , Rex Morgan , M.D. , and came to a sharp decision . He killed the strip , in its place ran an explanation : future sequences " dealt with an attempted mercy killing and had no place on this comic page . " <P> The Newark News was not the only paper that was disturbed by Rex Morgan , M.D. , although it was the only one that threw it out . From Canada the Hamilton , Ont . Spectator dashed off a query to the syndicate ; so did the staid Providence , R.I. Bulletin . <P> The strip worried them because it depicted a hospital nurse who had decided to engineer a mercy killing of her sick father . She had put an overdose of narcotics in a hypodermic so that her father 's nurse , thinking she was giving a normal dose , would inject it and kill him . Was Dr. Morgan in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present the pros &; cons of euthanasia . But the syndicate added comfortingly : Dr. Morgan would not forget his Hippocratic Oath . <P> Mystery Man . Actually , none of the 235 papers ( combined circ. 27 million ) which print Rex Morgan should have been surprised at his new adventure . In the 2 years since the strip first appeared , Rex Morgan 's concern with the problems of medical life has prompted him to take up questions that old-fashioned cartoonists and some editors might well think " had no place " on a comic page . But for its sharp and accurate commentary on medical problems , Rex Morgan , M.D. has won the admiration of medical men across the land . <P> The big reason for its success among physicians is that the originator of Rex Morgan is a doctor himself who uses the pen name " Dal Curtis . " His identity is kept a secret by Publishers Syndicate because Curtis , now 40 , is practicing in an Eastern city and he fears his fellow doctors would n't like the idea of his comic-stripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy , Curtis wanted to be a cartoonist , later changed his mind and attended medical school . <P> <P> After his practice was well established , he turned to cartooning again , now sends his rough sketches and continuity to Chicago Artists Marvin Bradley and Frank Edgington to polish up . Bradley and Edgington collaborate in their detailed and realistic pictures of hospital life . Says Edgington , apropos of the endless hospital scenes : " I 'm about the world 's greatest expert on the drawing of beds . " <P> The idea for Rex Morgan 's current sequence came from a Roman Catholic priest . He suggested to Presbyterian Curtis a few months ago that people do not know enough about euthanasia or what the real issues are . Curtis decided to enlighten his readers as he has before on cancer quacks , police and psychology . All have brought a flood of mail from medical men . The letter that Curtis prizes most came from Dr. Charles S. Cameron , medical and scientific director of the American Cancer Society Inc . Wrote Dr. Cameron : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendering the public ? "
