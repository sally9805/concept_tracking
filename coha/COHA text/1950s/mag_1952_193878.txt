Shortly after midnight on June 30 , a couple of young sailors from H.M.S. Belfast , on shore leave in Kobe , grabbed a Japanese cabby by the neck , robbed him of $5 and adjourned to a bar . They were caught , drinks in hand , and last week each was sentenced to 2 years at hard labor . It was the first sentence pronounced on foreigners since Japan regained her independence last April . The judge was careful to point out that the British tars got only half the minimum prescribed by Japanese law for assault and robbery . <P> But to London , fed up with failures and humiliations , this was too much . At the very moment of the arrest , Great Britain had been one of the U.N . nations negotiating with Japan to secure for U.N . troops the same privileges ( including trial by their own courts ) that Tokyo has given the U.S. security forces in Japan . The Foreign Office called the 30-month sentence " excessive and unjustifiable . " Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden was off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niece of Winston Churchill was announced . He rushed back to London , a fact by itself enough to send newsboys into the streets shouting " extra . " Mr. Eden summoned the Japanese ambassador and handed him a stiff note demanding that Japan hand over the two sailors . <P> Japan , fed up with six years of bowing before the occupiers , was also sensitive . The Japanese public applauded the sentence . The newspaper Yomiuri warned : " We hope the Japanese government , whose weak-kneed diplomacy was criticized in connection with the U.S. . . . agreement , will retain to the last their firm stand in the U.N . forces agreement . " <P> In London , the drunken sailors became " our boys . " In a savage little cartoon , Lord Beaverbrook 's London Evening Standard revived memories of vicious Japs in World War II . <P> Things were getting out of hand , and the U.S. stepped in . Ambassador Robert Murphy , backing the British , took up the $5 crisis with Premier Yoshida.         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
