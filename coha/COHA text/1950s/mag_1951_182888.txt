In most U.S. cities , the last place to find steady crowds right through the Christmas shopping season is the public library . In Atlanta , things were different this December , and with reason . A few days after Thanksgiving , the city threw open its enlarged and vigorously modernized main building ; the customers crowded in all month to borrow books , or just to browse , at a rate that astonished old library hands . In what was supposed to be an " off month , " there were hardly enough seats to go round . <P> A good deal of the credit for all this bustle belonged to Atlanta 's new librarian . Two years ago , when Atlantans voted 1,700,000 to expand their 48-year-old Carnegie Library and its string of branches , the city gave the top job to fast-moving , chain-smoking John Carl Settlemayer , 38 , onetime director of the Lincoln , Neb. library . <P> Canary &; Lime . Settlemayer knew what he wanted to do . He had been interested in libraries since he got a job , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My primary job , " Settlemayer says , " was to shelve books . But my secondary job was to go next door and get the firemen to put out kids who made any noise . " Instead of putting people out , Librarian Settlemayer figured that he should be bringing them in - and the more the merrier . <P> In Atlanta , one of his first moves was to have the old building cleaned of half a century 's grime and soot . Then he repainted the inside in fresh new colors : eggshell white , canary yellow , lime green . He had the heavy , forbidding front doors taken down , put in glass doors that opened by electric eye . In the main circulation room , he set up a Recordak machine to charge books in &; out photographically in a fraction of the time it used to take . <P> Look &; Listen . Settlemayer borrowed merchandising ideas from retail stores ( " Sure we are selling ; we 're selling reading " ) . When he learned that supermarkets find it hard to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelves accordingly . He insists that new books be displayed in the publisher 's fresh jackets , is replacing worn-out classics with bright new editions . " We even put magazines in the racks in their own covers . We do n't want them in the old ' library ' bindings . " <P> In every room-from the browsing room ( " Just what the name implies , " says a Settlemayer sign . " Look around . . . " ) , to the reference room ( " Answers questions on anything and everything , from quizzes to theses and back again " ) - he has installed brilliant lighting and brightly upholstered chairs . He has even had Muzak pumped in to " relax " his readers . Book circulation has more than doubled since Thanksgiving , and , once the " off season " ends , Librarian Settlemayer expects it to treble . He is still not satisfied . <P> Last week , like a salesman planning a new line of goods , Settlemayer set down a whole new list of New Year 's resolutions . He wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children . He also has ideas about installing television , so that Atlantans without sets of their own can watch it without having to go to a beer parlor . Said Librarian Settlernayer : " I 'd like to have as my slogan for this library : ' Where Friends Meet . ' "
