EACH side made important concessions . The Communists suffered their first setbacK at the truce table even before the agenda was adopted in July 1951 . The enemy wanted to discuss withdrawal of all " foreign " ( U.N . and Chinese ) troops from Korea . The U.N . negotiators refused , and the matter was left off the agenda for possible solution at a post-truce political conference . The second defeat of the Communists was the breaking down of their demand for a truce line on the 38th parallel . The third-and greatest-was their failure to win repatriation of prisoners unwilling to return to Communist control . The U.N. , in turn , failed to 1 ) get a trustworthy inspection system ( i.e. , one that would tie up the Reds as tightly as the allies originally hoped ) ; 2 ) win immediate liberation of anti-Communist prisoners ; 3 ) block construction of airfields in North Korea during the armistice . <P> Highlights of the agreement : <P> Article I. " A Military Demarcation Line shall be fixed and both sides shall withdraw two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demilitarized Zone between the opposing forces . " A truce line . and buffer zone were fixed once before , in November 1951 . They had to be redrawn last week , after the ground-gaining Communist attacks of last fortnight . At truce time , 2,350 square miles of former North Korean territory are still left in U.N . hands , while the Communists get 850 square miles south of the 38th parallel-a net gain of 1,500 for the allies . <P> Article II A. All fighting stops promptly within twelve hours of the armistice signing . Within 72 hours , all troops and equipment of both sides are withdrawn from the 2-mile-wide buffer zone . Within ten days allied forces withdraw from islands north of the 38th parallel . Rotation of 35,000 troops a month is permitted each side , but the level of existing forces must not be raised . Aircraft , tanks , artillery pieces , etc. which are worn out , damaged or destroyed during the truce may be replaced piece-by-piece . <P> Article II B. A Military Armistice Commission , composed of five U.N . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each side must be generals or admirals , is established . M.A.C . supervises the carrying out of the armistice terms , and polices the buffer zone . <P> Article II C. A Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission is established . It is composed of one officer each from Sweden , Switzerland , Poland and Czechoslovakia . The N.N.S.C. will have 20 neutral-nations inspection teams , and will watch five Communist " ports of entry " ( Sinuiju , Chongjin , Hungnam . Manpo , Sinanju ) and five U.N . centers ( Inchon , Taegu , Pusan , Kangnung , Kunsan ) .
