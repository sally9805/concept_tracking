In the harsh heat of Cairo International Airport last year , a Chinese-American traveler idly watched a scrawny Egyptian newsboy . The boy got nowhere with his tabloid sheet . But when Richard C. Kao of Los Angeles saw the boy snatch a piece of bread from a restaurant table , Kao decided that he wanted a newspaper . He offered a 5 note , his smallest bill . The boy quickly fetched the change . Counting it , Kao discovered that he had got his paper free . It was simple enough , the boy explained . The slender man " with the kind face " had only a 5 note ; he must be broke . The paper was free . <P> By last week , bright , shiny-eyed Abdel Rasik Hefny , 15 , had seen his thoughtful gesture blossom amazingly . An orphan , and sole support of a younger brother , Abdel was earning 75 a day on good days . He is now a delighted student at one of suburban Cairo 's finest private schools ; he is aiming for a Swiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to realizing a dream that seemed fantastic last year : " To become an educated man and help my people . " <P> By no means rich , polite Bachelor Richard Kao , 30 , is a sort of industrial scholar . He has a Ph.D . in economics ( University of Illinois ) and another under way in mathematics at U.C.L.A. An alumnus of Santa Monica 's famed nonprofit Rand Corp. , he now works for a similar " think palace , " the Planning Research Corp . in Los Angeles . To a man of Kao 's training , Newsboy Abdel 's quick mind was obvious . " His goal is good , " mused Kao . " He wants to be an educated man . " <P> When Kao got back home last year , he wrote Abdel advising him to find a school and get to work at his studies . Abdel picked out the Protestant-supported American Mission School for Boys , and Kao arranged to get him admitted this fall . Kao flew back to Cairo this summer , laid out Abdel 's four-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and French , two of German , four years of science ( including theoretical physics ) , four years of math ( including calculus ) . " I did not lead the boy to think that everything was now taken care of , " says Kao in his careful tones . " His report cards are mailed to me . He has what I guess you would call a fellowship . It will be renewed each year , so long as he earns it . " <P> The cost to Kao is about $700 a year . " This is really very little , " he says . " In fact , it cost me nothing . I teach a course at U.C.L.A. one night a week , and my income from that is enough to cover the boy 's education . " Kao finds it strange that this should interest anyone . " Really , I do not understand why anyone should question why someone helps someone else . If you are capable , you help . That 's all . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
