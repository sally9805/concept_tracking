Last week 's space-age notes : <P> Three engines burning furiously , an Air Force Atlas missile shot into the sky on a successful but limited ( 3,000 miles ) test flight . It was the third fully powered ( 360,000-lb. thrust ) flight for the 6,000-mile-plus ICBM . In preparation : a full-range shot , early this fall . <P> The Navy gave the full story on what happened to a Vanguard satellite that got lost in the skies on its way to orbit last May . The Vanguard , the Navy explained , was supposed to have climbed to 300-400 miles , then gone into its orbit . Instead , the second-stage engine failed to cut off , kept the Vanguard going up instead of letting it turn parallel to the earth 's surface . When the third stage fired at the wrong angle , the rocket just kept on going-straight up to 2,200 miles . The Navy 's reading of Cape Canaveral instruments showed that the satellite landed near the west coast of South Africa , 7,500 miles from Florida-if , that is , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth 's atmosphere . <P> The Soviets , famed for their spaceborne dog Laika , said they rocketed two more dogs 280 miles up somewhere over European Russia , recovered the animals-alive . The hermetically sealed passengers were both female , the Russians added , named Belyanka ( Whitey ) and Pestraya ( Spot ) . Total weight of the rocket and dogs : 3,700 Ibs.
