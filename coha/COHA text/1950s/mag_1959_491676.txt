With him here is pretty Jean Peters . returned Brazzi to stardom  --  this time in the U.S. RO S SANO 'S REVENGE That smoldering Italian star of the movie South Pacific , Rossano Brazzi , finally made it to the top after Hollywood once rejected him . This is how he got even . By ROBERT JOHNSON Six years ago Rossano Brazzi was a failure . Demoralized and debt-ridden , without honor in his native Italy and all but unknown in America , the man who today ranks as Hollywood 's leading romantic lover seemed at thirty-five to have skidded past the point of no return . No one then could have guessed that Brazzi ? the name rhymes with Patsy ? would rise from the rubble of his shattered career to star in such films as Summertime and South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life had been marked by an unbroken series of triumphs . Nothing he attempted had ever thwarted him . At seventeen , on a bet , he had boxed his way to the amateur featherweight championship of his country ? " Not because I was so good , " he says , " but mainly because I was very strong and the other people , they were very lousy . " At nineteen , he had earned his law degree from the University of Florence . At twenty-five , he was one of Italy 's most popular movie stars ? " I been box-office all my life , " he states . And during the war he served ably as one of three leaders of the anti-Fascist Underground in Rome . Perhaps , indeed , Brazzi 's trouble was that after the war he had no place to go but down . In any event by 1953 he had reached bottom . A humiliating assault on Hollywood five years earlier had been followed by the gradual loss ofhis popularity even with the once-devoted Italian public ; and in a desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand at producing . This turned out to be the greatest disaster of his life . Generous and trusting by nature , Brazzi has never been able to say " No " to anyone ? " If my husband were a woman , " his wife says , " he would always be pregnant " ? and he casually delegated authority to people with no more business sense than himself  --  which is to say , none . The result was that he wound up his career as a producer without a lira to his name . Worse , he discovered that he owed various creditors the equivalent of over 8,2no , one . Today he could pay off such an amount with the income from a single picture , but , at the time , his price had dwindled to little over $10,000 . With no other means of settling accounts , he began a frantic and self-defeating round of borrowing money at exorbitant rates of interest , first to pay the debts from his producing venture and then , at still higher rates , to satisfy the demands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to make money , he appeared in one hastily produced picture after another , with the predictable result that the remnants of his popularity swiftly disintegrated . Even more damaging for a man who has nothing to sell but himself was thegrowth in Brazzi 's once-robust ego of a malignant inferiority complex . Then , just as the bitter waters of despair were closing over him for what might well have been the last time , he was thrown a lifeline from the very place he blamed most for his predicament  --  Hollywood . With a courage supported by nothing more tangible than faith and friendship , Jean Negulesco , a director Brazzi had met in this country on his first visit , offered him a part in a forthcoming picture . Negulesco risked his reputation in doing so : the producers had specifically asked him to get another Italian actor for the part  --  Vittorio Gassman . Negulesco took it upon himself to say that Gassman was n't free , would n't be for years . On that basis the studio accepted Brazzi . " There are six roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect anything important . " But Brazzi was overjoyed . The picture was Three Coins in the Fountain , released in 1954. , and Brazzi , as a love-smitten young Italian , played the third male lead , behind Clifton Webb and Louis Jourdan . In truth the part was small , but the picture did well and it introduced Brazzi to the American public as an attractive new romantic personality . Then , as now , Brazzi 's looks fitted him admirably for the part . A trim I70 pounds today , with hips and ( Continued on Page 69 ) fsnliary a I wilt scarcely prominent enough to support a belt , he stands a couple of inches under six feet and looks shorter because of his wide shoulders , large head and big , strong features . " In California , " he says , ' 1 feel like a midget , but I am really quite tall  --  tall for un Italian , " Under casually groomed , slightly wavy dark hair , now gray over the ears , he has lively blue eyes and an expressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over the years a certain youthful prettiness had hardened into what Anna Magnani , the fiery Italian actress , calls " a handsomeness far more attractive than his previous beauty . " Brazzi 's looks , in fact , arc the kind that men can admire as well as women , according to Joshua Logan , who directed him in South Pacific . " Watching Brazzi , " Logan explains , " a man can feel , ' There , but for a few pounds , go I , ' " Combined with an aura of strength , of virile masculinity and of self-assurance which emanates from him to a distance of several feet , Brazzi has what Logan calls " an enormous tenderness . " And it is this rare combination of strong face and gentle manner that both Logan and Jean Negulesco consider the key to Brazzi 's enormous appeal for women . " Rossano , " says Negulesco , " is the kind of man that every woman  --  even happily married  --  would like to meet on a trip , for a fleeting romance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exert this catnip attraction is his own obvious and wholly unabashed interest in the opposite sex . " I see a beautiful woman , " he says , " and I like to watch her , and it 's just because this is my nature . I like women . I do n't say , you know , that I want to sleep with them . I never been too much of a coureirr  --  of a chaser , you know . " Despite this disclaimer , however , rumors of illicit romances with many of his leading ladies have for years buzzed about Brazzi tike flies around a sugar bowl . In some quarters  --  and particularly within the movie industry itself  --  such stories are given considerable credence . Indeed one close associate of the actor recently ex- Pla ned that he feels sure Brazzi 's success as a great lover on the screen stems directly from his " successes in life with the ladies . " Brazzi 's wife Lydia , a plump and jolly blonde , scoffs at these stories . " I may die the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the fact is that she has always accompanied her husband wherever he goes  --  and at his insistence . Lydia Brazzi is Rossano 's perpetual morale booster . As a family friend remarks , " There is such joy , optimism , and humor about this woman that everybody must love her . It is impossible to be near her and remain sad . They are truly a happy couple , with a positive resurgent joy at being alive and having one another . " Their only regret is that they have no children . " I tell you just in two words , " Brazzi says . " I 've been married nineteen years and I figure since then I went out alone , without my wife , three or four times  --  and just for business . I do n't say I am a saint , but thank God , you know , I did n't have any opportunity to fall in love with somebody else . This kind of tragedy , sickness that every married man can have , you know  --  I did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of opinion which explains the stories of Brazzi 's romantic entanglements as fictions actually invented by the actor himself . His object , the argument runs , was to lend a sort of paradoxical respectability to his role as a screen lover , a role he has always regarded as faintly shameful for an actor of any real ability . Even feeling that way , however , Brazzi makes no secret of the fact that he originally accepted  --  even encouraged  --  typecasting in the part , with a cold calculation worthy of his countryman Niccolb Machiavelli . After Three Coins in the Fountain he was not yet in a position to pick and choose . One success did not make a new career and he was still low man on a very slippery pole . All he had going for him then was his acclaim for the part in Three Coins , and he resolved to make the most of it . " They said , you know , ' Great Lover ' ? this kind of thing , " he explains , " And I say O.K. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazzi like this . " It was a gamble , he knew . " Is the most difficult role there is in the world , " he says . " There is nothing more funny than a man to say to a woman , you know , he likes her , he loves her  --  all these kind of things . You know , you can be so ridiculous . " But after the earlier fiasco in America , he figured he had a score to settle with Hollywood . And he decided that playing the Great Lover was probably the shortest course to his goal  --  namely , to appear in enough movies here to build a public following that would force the studios to meet him on his own terms . As he puts it , " My revenge in a little sense was to be established . " With his tenth and latest picture for the American market  --  Count Your Blessings , in which he stars with Deborah Kerr and Maurice Chevalier  --  Brazzi feels he has finally reached that point . " From now on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a picture that I do n't read the final script , Then if I make mistakes , it 's my mistakes . " That about sums up Brazzi 's definition of the word " established . " Winning the right to approve the script is important to him because he thinks that nothing can more completely hobble art actor than an inferior screen play . As a case in point , he cites his film , A Certain Smile , released last July . Taken from a novel by the young French existentialist Francoise Sagan , the picture concerns a moody college girl 's romantic adventure with a married Lothario of mature years . But the script , Brazzi contends , handled the affair so gingerly that " the love of these two people down there in the south of France , it does n't come out . " The result , he feels , was to leave him looking slightly ludicrous . This galls him . " I can make a lousy performance too , " he concedes , " but I do n't think my performance was lousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producer after first seeing the script : " 1 said , you know , ' This is a man down there ; show something . ' " He shrugs . " You can make worse pictures too " he says , " but if the story could have been a little different , my performance would have been hundred times better , " Brazzi takes his acting seriously , as befits a God-given talent . For he firmly believes that the basic quality an actor must possess ? " the way to feel things " ? has to be born in him . " in a picture , " he says , " you have a story and a role  --  a man who is not you . You must be able to transfer this character inside to you and adjust to it . This talent , some people has it ; some other people do n't . " In the latter class Brazzi unhesitatingly places those whom Hollywood has labeled " stars " because of some outstanding trait of personality or physical development . " A ' star , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the war , you know , the public started to like big things  --  you know , Jayne Mansfield , Marilyn Monroe . But a star only means popularity ; it does n't mean anything . So many stars are lousy . They do n't even know what acting is . They do n't even know anything . Actor , you know , is the best  --  professional acting . " Actually , he thinks that Marilyn Monroe has made the almost unprecedented metamorphosis from star to actress . " Very unusual , " Brazzi says ; " I admire her . She must have been working very hard . " He also thinks that Brigitte Bardot may someday , possibly , become an actress too . " But up to this moment , she 's a phenomenon , a personality , " he says . " I went to see a picture of hers in Paris and , you know , people were talking about her naked  --  all these kind of things . And really if I were her , I would n't show myself , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If Brazzi himself has avoided the stigma of stardom  --  in this sense  --  it is because of his long devotion to the actors ' muse . " 1 was a ham since I was live years old , " he says . At that age , his specialty was reciting poetry to his father 's friends when they dropped in of an evening . These performances took place in Florence , to which city the family had moved from Bologna when Rossano was a baby . Adelmo Brazzi , the father , owned a factory which turned out leather goods ; and Rossano and his younger brother and , later , a baby sister were brought up in at least modest affluence . When still not yet in his teens , Rossano first tasted the heady wine of ovation in a school operetta ? " I was the lead , of course " ? which proved so successful that , instead of the contemplated two days ' run in a local theater , the show was toured around the countryside for nearly three months . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I remember I was taking this very serious . " All through school , indeed , and on into his years at the university in Florence , he devoted a large part of his extracurricular energy to theatricals . In 1937 , after he received his degree , his father sent him to serve an apprenticeship with an older lawyer in Rome . Rossano was delighted  --  although not , perhaps , for just the reason his father would have preferred : Rome was the country 's theatrical center . During the next two years the fledgling attorney spent a small part of his time preparing briefs and a far greater part rehearsing stage productions with a repertory company he had joined . And in 1939 he was approached by Scalera , one of the leading Italian movie companies , with the offer of a three-year contract . Up to this moment Brazzi had never really considered film work ; his interest had lain entirely in the stage . And now for the first time he realized that he must make a choice that would determine the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he really wanted to devote his life to acting . " I was trained , you know , to be a serious person , " he says , meaning a lawyer , " and I knew already a little bit how phony it is , how fragile  --  all the life of an actor . " Also , he was now engaged to be married to a former schoolmate at the university , Lydia Bertolini , and the choice no longer involved himself alone . It was a decision not lightly to be undertaken , and Brazzi made it on a very practical basis . When he calculated that it would take him ten years as a lawyer to make as much money as he was now offered for one year in pictures , the choice seemed less difficult . Scalera lost no time in putting him to work , and in his first picture  --  The Trial and Death of Socrates  --  Brazzi once again attracted favorable notice . " I was a new face , " he deprecates , " not ugly , not a hunchback  --  these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made twenty-four more pictures , establishing himself principally as a kind of Latin Douglas Fairbanks  --  frequently complete to the mustache . He jumped horses through windows , swung from chandeliers , leaped from balconies and fenced until his wrist wilted . " No more duels , " he says now . " I had it . " Interspersed among these costume horse-operas were a few films that he re membeis with greater artistic satisfaction , most notably a screen version of Ayn Rand 's novel We , the Living . " This , " he says , " is still my best picture that I 've ever done . " But he was such sure-fire box-office as a swashbuckler that the studio rarely let him be sidetracked into parts requiring any real subtlety of characterization . Actually , Brazzi did not waste much worry over this . He was enjoying himself too much and keeping too busy . " You know , " he says , " to make a movie you have to work hard  --  very , very hard , I tell you . You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the work rewarded him richly . By the time film production in war-racked Italy came to a virtual halt in 1942 , the year Brazzi turned twenty-five , he was among the highest-paid stars in his country . The end of movie-making came at an opportune moment for Brazzi . Some months earlier he had been asked by the resistance forces if he would help obtain food for the people they had managed to spirit away from the SS executioners . All through the country food was in short supply , and of course the wards of the Underground had no legitimate sources . Many of them were close to starvation . Probably few men in Italy were better equipped to help than Brazzi . For one thing , he had money  --  and food could still be bought on the black market . For another , he could get sonic assistance through the Vatican ; as nephew of the Archbishop of Bari  --  now Marcello Cardinal Mimmi of Naples  --  Brazzi was a Papal Guard . Finally , since he was one of the actors who had been exempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he was considered by the Fascists to be above politics and at least passively loyal . But Brazzi found the cloak-and-dagger business very much to his taste . With the aid of the local resistance group , which he was presently asked to help lead , he not only succeeded in procuring food but started to assist in hiding Roman Jews who were known to be in danger . Here and there about the city , in the homes of friends , one or two at a time , the Underground farmed out its pathetic charges . And presently Brazzi began to capitalize on his knowledge of the nearby Cinecitta movie studio , which had been converted into a concentration camp . Night after dark night he helped smuggle out three or four inmates  --  many of them American , British and French prisoners of war . But each prisoner freed , each Jew saved from the executioner , meant one more mouth to feed , until finally the total reached nearly 2000 . And with each month the city 's food shortage grew more acute . Yet , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because people were starving . " Day after day , by car , by truck , by bicycle , Brazzi and his group brought food to the scattered hiding places . And every trip , every day , carried the risk of discovery and summary death . " If they find somebody that you hide in a house , you know , " Brazzi says , " they did n't make a trial , They just kill you . " Seven days before the liberation of Rome , Brazzi was arrested by the German SS . Perhaps somebody had talked ; to this day he does n't know . Fortunately for him , he was turned over to the Italian authorities and , says Brazzi , " I made a little bit of an acting . I said , you know , ' I been helping ererybody  --  could have been Fascist , could have been anybody . Because we are arrived to a certain point now that Italy is such in a mess , and I think we really forgot that , after all , we arc here all Italians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " Whether his interrogator was impressed by Brazzi 's eloquence or merely mindful of the Allies ' near approach , he ordered the actor jailed rather than shot . A week later , Brazzi 's guards vanished and he walked out free . For him  --  and for Rome  --  the war was over ; andwithin a few months the movie industry managed to struggle back to its feet . Brazzi started work on Italy 's first postwar picture , and once again life seemed to stretch before him smooth and inviting . What he failed to suspect , however , was that the horror and tragedy of the war so recently fought across their land had worked a profound change in the outlook of his countrymen . While Brazzi continued to serve up the heroics as before , a whole new school of movie-making came into being . It called itself Realism , and in that name many fine pictures were made  --  pictures like Open City and Paisan . Beside these harrowing little stories of personal heroism amid national suffering and humiliation , Brazzi 's acrobatic confections began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance in a remake of an old Rudolph Valentino movie , The Eagle , failed to halt more than temporarily the defection of his public . But then a wonderful thing happened . In 1948 the great David 0 . Selznick , discoverer of such European stars as Ingrid Bergman and Louis Jourdan , saw a composite film of some of Brazzi 's pictures and offered him a seven-year contract  --  one year , that is. plus options . ' ' I thought him an extraordinarily photogenic type , " 1 , Selznick says , " and a potentially important leading man for American films . " With his wife and a quantity of personal belongings , Brazzi voyaged to the United States , studying English on the way . In America he confidently expected to recoup the losses he-had suffered at home . Looking back now through jaundice-colored glasses , however , Brazzi remembers the ensuing period as " the worst year of my life . " Because Selznick was not , at the moment , making any pictures of his own , he lent the actor out to M-G-M @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make of Little Women with a group of youngsters including June Allyson and Elizabeth Taylor . Brazzi was cast  --  or rather , he insists , miscast  --  in a role he recalls with a shudder as that of a paunchy piano teacher . He could read almost no English at the time and , " 1 tell you , " he says , " I was not able to understand the script . I was able to speak , you know , simple things and to study by heart , but 1 did n't know what was going on in the script , you know . I thought it was a romantic part . " His disabusement came with the first application of make-up  --  whiskers , eyeglasses and a false belly . Brazzi was appalled . " I said , you know , ( Continued on Page 72 ) 72 ( Continued from Page 70 ) am Rossano Brazzi  --  from Selznick , ' and I thought they made a mistake , that they took me for somebody else . " Actually , Selznick says , he thought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , it was a role in which Paul Lukas had scored a considerable success in the original film production starring Katharine Hepburn . In the second . it was the only work the producer had succeeded in landing for his discovery . Unfortunately , according to Selznick , " Brazzi 's accent was extraordinarily bad  --  I am afraid he sounded like a Neapolitan comedian . " The result was that the producer 's efforts to lend Brazzi out to other studios had met with no success whatever until he persuaded LeRoy to use the actor in Little Women . In any case , Brazzi 's recollection of the role is understandable ; the critics were almost unanimous in finding his performance stiff , humorless and incredible . After this the actor could not get back to Italy fast enough . As he recalls it , Selznick tried to prevent his leaving , and there was a bit of a row , but the producer finally had to give in . " Because 1 was allergic to English , " Brazzi explains , " I could not speak the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wants to do these kind of things , he can do it . " Selznick remembers the matter somewhat differently . " It is a complete and unadulterated falsehood that I ever had the slightest altercation with Brazzi , " he says . " The plain facts of the matter are that , in consequence of my going out of ' production , and in consequence of his difficulty in overcoming his accent , I decided not to pick up my option . " Brazzi fled back to Italy , his ego smarting . But the failure in America was only a prelude to what his personal managers call his " destruction as a star in Italy . " Returning to the same sort of role in which he had once been so successful  --  a retreat which no psychologist would have trouble explaining  --  Srazzi succeeded only in quenching the embers of his popularity . Then , aslwe have seen , came the disastrous attempt at producing , the period of spiraling indebtedness , and at last the second chance at Hollywood in Three Coins . After this modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barefoot Contessa , with Ava Gardner and the late Humphrey Bogart , but it was only with his next film , in 1955 , that the actor really registered as an important new leading man . This was Summertime , in which he played the married , lower-middle-aged merchant of Venice with whom spinster-tourist Katharine Hepburn fails in love . Many fans still consider this Brazzi 's best part . " Was a romance , " he says , " but , you know , light  --  between laughter and tears . This is very good today . The public loves it . " Indeed the public did . Almost literally overnight , Brazzi found himself besieged with offers . Of these , the most important was an invitation from Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II , composer and librettist of the stage musical South Pacific , to audition for the role of Emile De Becque in the show 's film version . Brazzi , although out of practice , had studied operatic singing while in his teens ? " Oh , God , " he says , " I done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a favorable impression . If necessary , it was decided , a professional singer 's voice could be dubbed in on the sound track in places where Brazzi 's lacked the necessary fullness . This , in fact , is what was actually done : part of Dc Becque 's singing is in Brazil 's voice , a larger part is that of opera basso Georgio Tozzi . But even more important than the voice  --  at least from the point of view of Joshua Logan , the director  --  were Brazzi 's looks and manner . " For Emile Dc Becque , " Logan says , " we wanted a man of sophistication , a man of culture and refinement , and yet an outdoor man who could look like a planter  --  strong enough to have killed a man . Brazil had those qualities . " In 1955 , however , actual production of the film still lay more than two years in the future , and Brazzi marked time in four lesser movies . These were an English picture called Loser Takes All , with Glynis Johns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Esther Costello , with Joan Crawford ; and Legend of the Lost , with John Wayne and Sophia Loren ? " I think that very , very soon Sophia will be really on top in this country , " Brazzi says . " She is a very hard-studying girl . " None of these films can be called resoundingly successful . Following Legend of the Lost , however , Brazzi went to work on South Pacific . He was fascinated with his role as the South Seas planter Emile De Becque . " A man with a past , " he says , " with problems  --  two kids , you know , they arc colored  --  wife who died ; he loved her . And he finds a new little thing over there , nurse Nellie Forbush , that is . But honest , straight ; wants to marry her , That 's a character I like very much  --  a man , you know , really sculptured in rock . t would love to play Emile Dc Bccquc without the music . " The music , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Brazzi wanted to do all the singing himself . " But , " says Logan , " Dick and Oscar felt that his voice did not have the fullness for this score . The songs were created for an opera singer . " Even beyond this , however , Brazil argued that the romantic numbers  --  Some Enchanted Evening , for example  --  should be kept quiet and intimate , the words almost talked rather than bellowed in a big operatic voice . " What they missed in the picture , " he says , " was the intimacy of the story of the two people . " Since the others disagreed , Brazzi did not labor the point . " But if they did as 1 POST said , " he maintains , " I think it would have been better . " Logan , although adamant on the subject , sympathized with the actor . " It was a little struggle with his own ego , " he says . " It 's difficult to feel it 's exactly your own role with this dubbing . " Quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Brazzi acted the songs brilliantly . " He can convince you by his emotions , by his eyes , by the attitude of his body , that he believes the words , " says Logan . " I think he is a far better actor than he has been allowed to show . " Certainly , as we have seen , Brazil feels he was prevented from showing much ability in A Certain Smile , his next film after South Pacific . The picture came and went in the nation 's theaters with truly dizzying speed ; and even in Europe , where Brazzi thought it might do better  --  Maurice Chevalier found it a " modem classic , beautifully told " ? the public resolutely ignored its existence , A far more felicitous vehicle for Brazzi in Europe , he now feels sure , is the forthcoming screen version of Nancy Mitford 's frivolous novel , The Blessing .

This is something new for Brazzi , and he found the change of pace both rewarding and challenging . As a man whose own sense of humor  --  reinforced . perhaps , by a slight self-consciousness about being known as the Great Lover  --  is apt to take the form of burlesquing his screen roles , Brazil quickly discovered that , if he did not consciously underplay his part in the picture , he was likely to appear hammy . " When you play the comedy , " he says , " you have to believe it . Otherwise it becomes so phony  --  a caricature . " Nevertheless both he and Jean Negulesco , who directed the film for M-G-M , feel that in comedy Brazil has struck a vein he can mine perfectly for years . But with South Pacific still going strong nearly a year after its first release , and with Count Your Blessings not yet in distribution , Brazzi is in no hurry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds a script too tempting to pass up , he would prefer to relax at home for a while . Home , for the Brazzis , is Rome . Much as they enjoy the climate of Los Angeles  --  smog excepted  --  they have no intention of transplanting themselves to America . They rent a furnished house , preferably in Beverly Hills , whenever Rossano is working on a picture here ; but in Rome they own a newly finished penthouse apartment which they have only just moved into . Brazil wants a chance now to try out the gadgets he has had installed there  --  the stereophonic hi-fi , for instance , and a small movie theater . This is not to say that he expects to be absent from the business of film making for long . Although he thinks he may retire from acting in another ten years or so  --  possibly to try his fine Italian hand at directing  --  he has been reading new scripts for some weeks now .

Not to the world and not to yourself . do n't say , you know , that you are the greatest . I do n't say that you are the lousiest . But you are a professional actor . " Brazzi regards that attainment as quite enough to ask of life .
