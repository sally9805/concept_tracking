The word of the week in Sweden was religionsfrihetslag ; it meant a new measure of religious freedom for Swedes . <P> Ever since a young nobleman named Gustav Vasa fought his way to the throne in the 16th century and broke with Rome , Sweden has been overwhelmingly Lutheran . For most of that time it has had a Lutheran state church with the kind of brassbound temporal authority that Protestants are often pointing fingers at the Roman Catholics for . The king of Sweden and all his ministers had te be members of the Church of Sweden , * all citizens had to pay taxes for its support , and no one could leave it officially except to join another Christian church . Roman Catholics were forbidden to set up monasteries or convents . <P> By the law that went into effect this week after seven years of deliberation , the king , the minister of ecclesiastical affairs and education , state church officials and professors of practical theology still have to be Lutherans . But anyone else may drop out and join any church he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Catholics may organize monasteries and convents if they wish to . Citizens who do not belong to the state church will now get a 40% exemption from the obligatory church tax . <P> The non-state churches expect no stampede to their ranks . " It will be a trickle , not a landslide , " said Methodist Bishop Theodor Arvidson . <P> <P> *Which nominally covers about 98% of Sweden 's 7,000,000 population . Of the 300,000 ' ' dissenting " Baptists , Methodists , Pentecostals , Roman Catholics and others , many are still counted as members of the state church .
