Early in 1950 , the London Economist 's Geoffrey Crowther , a footloose editor with a nose for news , made his annual inspection trip of U.S. industry . " I came here expecting to see a boom , " he said , " but nothing I had read prepared me for this . The very air smells of boom . For the firsttime , the U.S. is beginning to smell like 1929 again . " <P> There was certainly a lot of 1929 's heady , champagne flavor about the U.S. in 1950 , right down to the biggest bull market in 20 years . Gold-Digger Lorelei Lee was a reigning musical-comedy queen ; F. Scott Fitzgerald had not only been enthusiastically revived , but was the hero of a novel that led the bestseller lists . Nightclubs were jammed , theater tickets occasionally went for $50 apiece , and useless luxuries-men 's garters trimmed in 14-carat gold , mink scarves for three-year-olds , diamond-studded car keys-were salable items again . In an offhand manner , a Houston oilman sent a new Cadillac to Europe to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructions to " throw the old body away . " <P> But these were only the wasteful surface symptoms of a boom which had a diamond-hard foundation based on production and efficiency . The U.S. had worked so hard , produced so much and expanded so fast in 1950 that it had met its most serious challenge : the creation of a strong and flexible economy thoroughly capable of switching over to full-scale rearmament . In the fight against Communist slavery , this was a more important fact than the intervention in Korea or the Brussels conference . <P> <P> In 1950 , by pouring out the greatest abundance of goods in history , the U.S. fashioned gigantic new standards to measure its new industrial might : <P> The automakers , who had scarcely expected to match 1949-8 record-smashing production of 6,500,000 trucks and cars , rolled out about 8,000,000 units , at a rate of 15 a minute-about five times more than the rest of the world combined . <P> In the greatest housing boom in history , builders started 2 new houses a minute . The 1,360,000 begun during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to house a population as big as Chicago 's . <P> All year long , in the sky over Pittsburgh , Youngstown and a dozen other steel towns , there was a pillar of smoke by day and the glow of fires by night , as the mills worked at capacity . They ladled out 97 million tons of the metal , almost 10 million more than in the peak year of World War II , and twice as much as all the steel mills in the rest of the world . <P> The U.S. productive machine popped out more than 7,000,000 television sets , almost triple 1949 ; 7,212,000 electric irons , 4,525,000 electric toasters , 4,212,000 washing machines , 1,830,000 ranges , 890,000 home freezers , more than 1,000,000 Hopalong Cassidy suits , and enough nylon stockings to give every woman in the U.S. eleven pairs .
