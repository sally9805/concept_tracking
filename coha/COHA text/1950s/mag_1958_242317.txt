Businessmen are often confused by the contradictory actions of the U.S. trustbusters . Last week they had even more reason for confusion . The Federal Trade Commission ruled last month that a merger would not tend automatically to create a monopoly even though it gave 45.6% of the household steel-wool market to one company , Brillo Manufacturing Co . But last week the Justice Department sued to break a deal that would give 21% of the detergent market to Lever Bros . Co . <P> The U.S. wants Lever to give up its right to make All , a detergent that Lever acquired from Monsanto a year ago . Lever argued that adding All 's 5% of the U.S. market to other Lever detergents ( Surf , Breeze , Wisk , etc. ) , which hold 16% , bolstered Lever in its battle against giant Procter &; Gamble , which has 55% of all U.S. detergent sales . But the trustbusters held that All should not have been sold to any of the soap industry 's Big Three-Procter &; Gamble , Colgate-Palmolive or Lever . Said Justice Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition , not the competitor ; to support the process , no matter who gets hurt or who benefits . " <P> No one doubted that Lever would be hurt as a competitor if the U.S. wins its case . But many businessmen wondered just how a Government victory would help protect competition .
