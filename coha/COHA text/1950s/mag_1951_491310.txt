THE Internal Security Act of 1950 , sometimes called the McCarran Act or the anticommunist law , is one of the most controversial and least-understood laws in the history of the republic . Yet it is of high importance that Americans understand it , since it involves ( 1 ) our national safety and ( 2 ) our individual liberties . Its advocates say this law helps protect our safety and does not endanger our liberties . Its critics say that it does not protect our safety , and does endanger our liberties . There are wise and patriotic men on both sides of the argument . The law is there for all to read . Yet one side says " Good , " the other says " Bad . " Public understanding of the law was further obscured by an accident of timing . The final debates on the bill and the split between Congress and the President , which would normally have had top billing in the newspapers and on the radio , were overshadowed by the news from Korea . That was the week of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the anticommunist bill were drowned out , for the public , by anticommunist gunfire . On September twentieth the law was passed overwhelmingly by the House and the Senate . Two days later President Truman vetoed it . His veto message , 5000 words long , detailed and fervent , was one of the most emphatic ever written by a President . He said the law " would not hurt the communists . Instead , it would help them . . . it would actually weaken our existing internal security measures . . . . It would make a mockery of our Bill of Rights and of our claims to stand for freedom in the world . . . give aid and comfort to those who would destroy us . .. this legislation would be a terrible mistake . " And he gave his reasons at length . His veto was applauded by many influential newspapers , by numerous churchmen and distinguished liberals , and by the heads of the AFL and CIO  --  who usually swing great weight with Congress . Nevertheless the House and Senate promptly overrode Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Democratically con. - trolled Congress , was able to muster only ten senators and forty-eight representatives  --  a bit over 10 per cent of each house  --  to support his veto . How explain this vast rift , this astonishing divergence ? Critics of the law say : " Congress had the election jitters . In its hysteria it was willing to vote for any law , even a bad one , just to prove its anticommunist sentiments . " But in the Senate only one third of the members were up for re-election , including Southerners who I had no perceptible opposition . Among senators who favored the bill  --  though they had no immediate election problem  --  were such able and nonhysterical Republicans as Saltonstall , Margaret Chase Smith and Vandenberg ; among the Democrats who broke with the President were Tom Connally , Truman 's faithful right arm in foreign relations , and liberals such as Sparkman , of Alabama , and O'Mahoney , of Wyoming . How about the House ? Back in the spring of 1948 , with no election jitters in sight , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which contained many features of the present anticommunist law . Election jitters may have somewhat hurried and swelled the vote this September ; they do not " explain " that vote , or explain it away . Advocates of the law have quite a different explanation for the Congress-President rift . " Truman , " they say , " is soft on communism . " They cite this unfortunate cracks about red herrings and Uncle Moe . They overlook the fact that Truman made the top decisions which , through the Marshall Plan and European rearmament , blocked communist expansion in the West . They forget that it was Truman who made the hard and fateful decision to send American troops to the defense of South Korea against communist aggression . Aspersions on the sincerity or patriotism of the President and Congress get us nowhere . This law is something new under the sun . It is a complex law , designed to deal with a devilishly complex danger ? Russian-controlled communist infiltration in the United States. , No man on earth is wise enough to predict just how this law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 opinion . Sometimes these differences struggle painfully within the mind of an individual . Consider the case of Sen. Paul Douglas , of Illinois . He is one of the most-respected men in the Senate , for his learning , his practical sense and his integrity . He is a hardheaded liberal . During the war he enlisted , at the age of fifty , as a private in the marines . He rose through the ranks , via combat , to lieutenant colonel . He was twice wounded , and decorated for heroism in action . At first Mr. Douglas was opposed to the bill , but at one stage of its progress  --  September twelfth  --  he became persuaded that its values outweighed its defects . He voted for it . When the bill came back from conference his doubts returned . He spent sleepless hours of prayerful indecision . During the feverish all-night senatorial session of September 22-23 , he was one of the ten who battled to uphold the President 's veto . Was this just opportunistic wobbling ? I do n't think anyone who knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas in that Senate debate , tears in his eyes and choking with emotion as he stated his position , could feel the sincerity , the desperate difficulty , of his decision . If a student of government such as Douglas could be so torn by inner conflict , it is natural that other men should disagree . My feeling is that the rift between the President and Congress , and their respective supporters , is an honest difference . It is also extremely bitter , and therein lies trouble . If this bitterness is allowed to fester and ferment , it will becloud enforcement of the law , confuse fair judgment of its results and make impossible any intelligent attempt to amend or improve it . This law is too important to be made the prey of personal pride , stubbornness or pique . The President , the executive departments and Congress must make a continuing effort at better understanding . If they ca n't agree , they can at least narrow down the area of their disagreement , define it clearly and mark it factually . The President should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contained at least two errors of fact and several doubtful opinions , dogmatically expressed . Legislators , on the other hand , should think twice before accusing the President and the executive departments of " sabotage " every time there is a mess-up in enforcement . There are bound to be snafus under this elaborate new law . Some may be the fault of the enforcers ; others may he the fault of obscurities or defects in the law which should be faced and corrected . The full devious genius of the communists will be working to make a monkey of the law ; there is no need to help them along by gratuitous squabbles between Capitol Hill and the White House . And now , if the reader will just brew a pot of strong coffee and apply a cold towel to the brow , we will take a cautious glance at the law itself  --  the Internal Security Act of 1950 . It is about 25,000 words in length , and full of such lively nuggets as this : Sec. 20 . The Act of June 8 , 1938 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amended , is hereby further amended as follows : ( a ) Strike out the word " and " at . the end of section 1 ( c ) ( 3 ) , insert the word " and " at the end of section 1 ( c ) ( 4 ) , and add the following paragraph immediately after section 1 ( c ) ( 4 ) : . . . Fortunately , Sec. 20 is one of the less-controversial sections of the law . Do n't give it another thought . I brought it up simply to show that this law is hard reading , even for lawyers and skilled legislators . Why on earth , you may ask , did n't Congress write a brief , clear , simple law to control communist infiltration ? Try and do it . The communists are past masters of the art of wrapping themselves in the United States Constitution which they hope eventually to destroy . They dodge happily ? pending the revolution  --  behind the clauses protecting freedom of speech and assembly , the guarantees against self-incrimination and bills of attainder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of law . The problem is to strike at communist conspiracy without tearing the fabric of the Constitution which protects us all . Freedom for discussion , for criticism , for new ideas , has been the very lifeblood of our system , the source of our vitality and strength . This problem , one of t he toughest nuts Congress ever had to crack , has become obviously urgent only in the last three or four years . There has been a Communist Party in America since World War I , but for many years most Americans did not take the commies seriously , regarding them as just another bunch of wild-eyed crackpots , a nuisance , but not a danger to the country . Maybe they sympathized with Russia ; so what ? Backward , sprawling Russia , far away across the oceans , could not hurt the U.S.A. The Hitler-Stalin pact , when American commu ' nists switched with slavish haste to follow the Moscow line , was a jolt . This switch did not look like " sympathy , " but like direct , control from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1940 , making it a crime to advocate the overthrow of the Government by force and violence . Before the Smith Act could get a tryout against the communists , however , we were fighting on Stalin 's side against Hitler . The Russians were our allies and Americans eased up toward communists in this country . The latter played sweet . They even dissolved their party , reorganizing it as the Communist Political Association , with loud cheers for Washington , Jefferson and Lincoln . Their new cloak of respectability enabled them to infiltrate more smoothly into the Government , the unions and various benevolent groups of right-thinkers and do-gooders . It was in 1947 that Uncle Sam began to wake up to communism , like a man in the movies doing a slow-motion double-take . The man thinks he has a harmless baby hear cub by his chair ; gradually he becomes aware that the fierce mother bear has crept up behind him and is breathing down his neck . Meanwhile the bear cub , with surprising strength , grips him by the ankle and is ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans had believed that . Russia would ( 1 ) reciprocate the friendliness we had shown her during the war , and ( 2 ) devote her energies to peaceful reconstruction . Instead she continued to maintain and build the strongest army in the world ; took over the countries of Eastern Europe by terror and subversion ; reached out for China ; stepped up her infiltration of Western Europe ; militantly reactivated the Communist Party in America ; and screamed unending invective against the U.S.A. She blocked the plan for international atomic control and inspection , and frantically built atomic plants of her own ; she industriously copied planes ? B-29 's stolen from us d uring the war ? cepa bleof dropping bombs on American cities . This increase in Russian power and aggressiveness automatically changed the complexion of the communist problem in America . As long as Russia was powerless to hurt America , the fact that she had 60,000 devotees in this country of 150,000,000 inhabitants might be rated as a remote danger . A Russia capable of overrunning all Europe and dropping bombs and paratroopers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning , her 60,000 devotees might decisively cripple America:8 defenses . Thus communists in America , who had earlier been ranked as a remote danger , began to be regarded as " a clear and present danger . " The words are important because , when a man 's activities become what judges call " a clear and present danger " to America , he begins to lose the protection of the Bill of Rights . The tolerant smile of the Constitution is withdrawn , and the culprit hears instead the ominous rumble of those majestic words of the Preamble : " We , the people of the United States , in order to . . . provide for the common defense . . . ? " It was in 1947 that the House of Representatives began to consider the communist infiltration of America " a clear and present danger " which must be met by new laws " for the common defense . " The House thus initiated the long legislative struggle which finally produced the Internal Security Act of 1950 . It was clear from the beginning that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the need ofkeeping within the letter and spirit of the Constitution . Secondly there was the problem of coping , through legal forms , with persons who  --  by their creed according to Lenin  --  use lies , stealth and deception as standiird operating procedure . They are not simple " toilers . " Most American communists are warped or rebellious intellectuals from the middle classes . Among their leaders and their lawyers there are men of twisted brilliance . If you confront them with a loose law , they will not merely evade it , they may even turn it to their own advantage as a propaganda weapon . Two approaches to the problem were considered by the House Committee on Un-American Activities . One was to " outlaw " the Communist Party , forbid and punish all communist activity as treasonable . The other was to expose the party by requiring it to make full public " disclosure " of its finances , officers , members , fronts and propaganda . Extensive hearings were held , with all shades of opinion invited , including the communists themselves  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " poisonous project , " " vile atrocity " and " monstrous conspiracy . " The " outlaw " idea seemed simple and direct , but it presented both constitutional and practical difficulties . J. Edgar Hoover , head of the FBI , who knows his communists , feared that it might , do more harm than good . By driving the commies underground , it would make harder the task of keeping tab on their conspiratorial plans . Gov . Tom Dewey opposed outlawing . Many other countries had tried it without success . Canada passed such a law , and later gave it up as worse than useless . The knouts of the czar in Imperial Russia , the concentration camps of Hitler in Germany , had failed to extirpate communism in those countries . The " disclosure " idea was that communists , like microbes and maggots , can not thrive in the sunlight . Some lawyers , such as Morris Ernst , of New York , believed that disclosure could be forced via the tax and postage laws , plus a law like New York 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commies could be allowed to operate freely , with the certainty that their movement would wither under the common sense of the American people . This disclosure idea appealed to Congress , but , assuming the commies were brought out into the open , how freely could we afford to let them operate ? Could we let them have passports , thus permitting them to trot off to Moscow , every orifice stuffed with microfilm , for cozy visits with the Politburo ? Could we let them work in the Government ? Could we let them work in key defense plants ? The Congress said no , no , no and a few more no 's . A bill combining disclosure with various controls , prohibitions and penalties was first shaped up as the Mundt Bill . It grew into the Mundt-Nixon Bill , which passed the House in May of ' 48 by a vote of 319 to 58 . Moving over to the Senate , the bill was developed further into the Mundt-Ferguson Bill . More hearings were held . The bill was pawed over by eminent constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Senate Judiciary Committee . It emerged finally as the first seventeen sections ? the most controversial part  --  of the new Internal Security Act of 1950 . The process took over thirty months . Whatever you may think of these first seventeen sections , it is not fair to say that they are " panicky , hurried " legislation . Bit THE SATURDAY EVENING POST Januar , 13 , 1931 Meanwhile other legislators and officials were devising additional means of attack on communist infiltration : bills to tighten up the laws on espionage and sabotage ; to shut off the immigration or naturalization of communist and other subversive aliens , and to make their deportation easier ; and a bill to lock up dangerous subversives in time of war . Some of these were approved or suggested by President Truman or the Justice Department , others were opposed by them . At the last moment all were somewhat hastily tinkered together into the so-called " omnibus bill " ? the Internal Security Act . Hence the charges that the law is " a catchall , a grab bag , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill retort that all parts of the law are aimed at the same target  --  the communist conspiracy . Why not attack on all fronts ? The first seventeen sections , however , remain the most disputed and novel part of the law . This part is also the most fascinating , if you have the patience to wade through it . Hidden beneath its legalisms there is the excitement of a gladiatorial show . In ancient Rome there was one type of gladiator called a net fighter treliaritts ) . He was forbidden to use sword , shield , ax , spear or armor . He went into the arena carrying only a large net and a trident . Thus weirdly equipped , be fought for his life against a fully armed opponent . The net fighter was at first greeted with derision , but if he was skillful enough he won in the long run . He circled his opponent tirelessly , wore him down and finally entangled him in the net , where he lay thrashing helplessly . Congress , restrained by the Constitution from using direct-action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the net fighter . The law starts out by declaring that " Nothing in this Act shall be construed . in any way to limit or infringe upon freedom of the press or of speech as guaranteed by the Constitution . " It then explains the necessity for legislation . " Congress hereby finds that ( 1 ) there exists a world Communist movement ... The movement , is described in detail : its methods of deceit and infiltration ; its objective of world domination ; its results , totalitarian tyranny in each country it takes over . The law never mentions Russia by name . It just says , " The direction and control of the world Communist movement is vested in and exercised by the Communist dictatorship of a foreign country . " Which foreign country ? The spires of the Kremlin loom clearly through the legal verbiage . Congress then finds that this world communist movement and its thousands of adherents in this country present " a clear and present danger to the security of the United States . " Therefore it must enact legislation " to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its net , closes a hole . The Smith Act , mentioned earlier , makes it a crime to advocate overthrow of the Government by violence . But in 1948 the communists in Czechoslovakia showed that they had techniques for taking over a country without using open violence . Therefore the new law , in Section 4 ( a ) , makes it a crime , punishable by up to ten years in jail and a fine up to $10,000 , for any person knowingly to conspire " to perform any act which would substantially contribute to the establishment within the United States of a totalitarian dictatorship ... control of which is to he vested . . . in any foreign gov ernment . Pmoideri however , That this subsection shall not apply to the proposal of a constitutional amendment . " Under this section a man may work for any sort of constitutional amendment he pleases , however daffy , drastic or radical ; he can scream from the housetops for a dictatorship , if it is to be a strictly American dictatorship , with no foreign strings attached . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for foreign control over America , he treads in the shadow of prison . But just exactly what is meant by " substantially contribute " ? A criminal law must be definite . Some lawyers think this section is invalid because of vagueness , Some labor leaders who are sincerely anticommunist fear this section . Suppose there is a legitimate strike . Commie leaders  --  as they often do  --  join in and begin whooping things up . Might not Section 4 ( a ) be used to break the strike , and jail loyal labor leaders as well as the commie troublemakers ? Advocates of the law say this would be impossible ; the courts can be trusted to draw the line of criminality sensibly as each case may arise . Even if this Section 4 ( a ) should be held invalid , there would remain the big net : the registration-disclosure provisions . They provide that all communist organizations and individuals shall register with the Attorney General or face heavy punishments . Sounds simple ? But first the law must define the registrants , and then establish fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The law divides communist organizations into two classes : " Communist-action organizations " and " Communist-front organizations . " The definitions are complicated by the refusal of Congress to use that nasty word " Russia , " but they boil down to this : a Communist-action organization is pure communist in leadership and membership , and is " substantially directed , dominated or controlled " from communist headquarters in Russia . Here Congress obviously had in mind the American Communist Party , including its various sections , branches and fractions . A communist-front organization , on the other hand , is mixed . Some , or even a majority , of its members and nominal leaders may be noncommunists . They may be sympathetic " fellow travelers " or they may be quite innocent dupes , quite high-minded dopes . Frequently they are rich and generous . They take a naive pleasure in seeing their names on letterheads and on imposing lists of sponsors . But the front has other members who are communists . They do the real work of the organization . They occupy such strategic positions as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rig the meetings , frame the suave  --  communist line  --  resolutions and run the benevolent fund-raising drives which funnel part of the proceeds back to the Communist Party . By definition of the law , a communist-front organization is one which is substantially controlled by a communist-action organization and is thus primarily operated to give support to the world communist movement . The front is a valuable propaganda device ; it provides respectability and money which could be obtained in no other way . The communists use it , in various forms , in every country which they in filtrate . The fronts operate under pretty names like American League for Peace and Democracy , Congress of American Women and League of American Writers . Both communist-action and communist-front organizations are required to register , giving name , address , all officers during the past twelve months , and a detailed financial accounting . Then comes a difference : the communist-action organization must go one hard step further . It must register every person who has been a member at any time during the twelve months preceding registration . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to upwards of 50,000 persons . Failure to register and willful false statements or omissions in registration are punishable by fine and imprisonment , up to five years and $10 , ? 000 . And note this : each day of failure to register , each willfully false statement of a name or a fact " shall constitute a separate offense . " A man who wants to defy this law can easily make himself liable to a few hundred years in the clink . When the net finally closes in , it cuts deep . But the net does not close suddenly or capriciously . There are elaborate safeguards for the innocent . There are so many safeguards , in fact , that it may be years before any communist is forced to make the choice between registering or going to jail . President Truman fears that the initial legal proceedings may take two to four years , followed perhaps by " an endless chase " as the communists dodge from one subterfuge to another . Advocates of the law predict much quicker results , but even they admit there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The law requires all communist organizations  --  action and front  --  to register within thirty days . That period expired last October twenty-third . No communists registered . Nobody expected them to . The communist leaders have long vowed that they would not register . In the hearings on the bill William Z. Foster , then president of the American Communist Party , so testified : Mr. Foster : We are not going to register . Senator Donnell : No matter whether the Supreme Court orders you to or not ? Mr. Foster : No matter who tells us .... We are not going to register . The law does not impose any immediate punishments for failure to register . First it is necessary to prove that the Communist Party is in fact " a Communist-action organization " as defined by the law . In other words , that the party is foreign-controlled , obediently follows the Moscow line , operates in part on a concealed and secret basis , communicates covertly with the Kremlin , and gives its primary allegiance to Russia rather than to the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The truth must be determined by due process of law . So the law sets up a board , called the Subversive Activities Control Board , to hear and try the facts . The board has five members , appointed by the President , by and with the advice and consent of the Senate . Of the five members , no more than three can belong to the same political party . When the Attorney General believes that an organization or individual should register , he goes to the board with a petition , setting forth his version of the facts and asking that the board order registration . Thereupon the board holds hearings . The hearings are public . Each side " shall have the right to present its case with the assistance of counsel , to offer oral or documentary evidence , to submit rebuttal evidence , and to conduct such cross-examination as may be required for a full and true disclosure of the facts . " As this is written , the first petition , and by all odds the most important  --  that against the Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board . The petition traces in about 5000 words the history of the party in America since 1919 , pointing out how it has followed every twist of the Moscow line . The Government lawyers who drew this petition , and who will present the first case before either the board or a special examiner appointed by the board , are experienced in communist tactics . As you study the law you realize that the entire registration net hangs on this first case against the Communist Party . Unless and until there is " a final order of the board , " identifying the party as " a Communist-action organization , " and ordering it to register  --  until that rather distant day nothing much can happen . Until then no obligation falls on any individual communist to register . Until then no final action can be taken against communist fronts , since these by definition are groups " controlled by a Communist-action organization , " and you ca n't pin down the front without first pinning down the action group . Thus the enforcement of the law resembles the famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabbit . " The rabbit in this case is the Communist Party , a wily and longwinded animal . When the registration provisions were first shaped up , back in ' 48 , it was thought that the public hearings might take a few Weeks . Since then the communists have shown their genius for delay . They dragged out the Harry Bridges trial for almost five months ; in the New York trial of the eleven communist leaders , they and their lawyers protracted the proceedings to nearly nine months with their objections , objurgations , screams and repetition . They almost gave Judge Medina a nervous breakdown . If the communists use similar tactics before the board , it is impossible to guess how long the hearings may last . The board does not have , as Medina had , the power to punish for contempt of court . But the board does have ? tucked away in Section 13 ( d ) ( 2 ) ? a curious and ingenious little weapon of its own . " Where ... a party or counsel is guilty of misbehavior which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excluded from further participation in the hearing . " That little sentence is full of dynamite , and I imagine the communist lawyers are studying it far into the night in their Union Square warrens . Properly used , it could expedite the hearings . Used unreasonably or ruthlessly , it might give the communists a basis for appeal . When the hearings are over , the board if it finds that the Communist Party is " a Communist-action organization " ) will " order " the party to register . But this is not a final order . It has no teeth , no prison breath . The communists still have sixty days to carry their case to the United States Court of Appeals . This court not only ponders the constitutional questions hut re-surveys the entire factual record . It may even send the case back to the board for further hearings . The findings of the board , as to facts , are conclusive only " if supported by the preponderance of the evidence . " Suppose the Court of Appeals , at last , affirms the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order . The communists have another breathing spell , while the case is being reviewed by the Supreme Court . That takes time also . But when and if the Supreme Court speaks , and allows the order of the hoard to stand , then in ten days it becomes " a final order of the board . " When and if there is a final order , the Communist Party and its members will be in a really hot spot . Whatever they do , they are in trouble . Suppose they just step up and register . It is not merely that this would cost them the privilege of passports , of Government employment , of working in certain defense plants  --  these privileges have already been whittled away by executive order . What hurts is this : by registering , the communists would openly brand themselves as a Russian-controlled outfit . Their literature and broadcasts would have to be labeled as coming from a communist source . Their respectable fronts and innocent dupes would drop away . Their secret financing would be exposed . Their membership would dwindle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suppose they openly refuse to obey a final order to register ? Then their liabilities to imprisonment ? as mentioned above -- would mount with appalling speed . Confronted with these harsh alternatives , the communists may decide neither to register nor to defy , but to evade . Shortly before the final order comes down from the Supreme Court , the communists may announce that the Communist Party is dissolved . Then , after a bit , they might form a new organization , called " The 1000 American Patriotic Society for Amending the Constitution . " If such a group had the same membership and leadership as the old Communist Party , the courts could peer through the transparent fiction and apply the final order to the new group . But if the communist evasive tactics were sufficiently ingenious and elusive , the law might be in trouble . Suppose the communist leaders all bring forth affidavits of resignation , witnessed before a notary twelve months prior to the final order ? Suppose they do n't form one new organization , but filter out into a variety of groups , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another ? Then the long legal proceedings might have to start all over again . Communist individuals might have to be pinned down one by one , 5ach with his own final order . This is the " endless chase " foreseen by Mr. Truman and other critics of the law . They say the thousands of cases would put an impossible burden on the Justice Department , clog the courts and cost untold millions of dollars . Worst of all , say the critics , when you begin proceeding against cells and individuals , there is almost no way of proving communist membership except by persons who have attended the communist secret meetings . In other words , by plants and undercover men working for the FBI and the United States counterintelligence agencies . Once these men have been used on the witness stand , their future value as undercover men is gone . It is hard , almost impossible , to replace such men , as the communists become ever more suspicious of newcomers . " It could only result , " says Mr. Truman , " in destroying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and thus give aid and comfort to the very communists whom the bill is supposed to control . " Backers of the law argue that in the first big case against the Communist Party the Government can rely largely on the undercover men already used as witnesses in the trial before Judge Medina ; and each of these witnesses could then be used against large numbers of individual communists . For example , Angela Calomiris , the brilliant girl photographer who masqueraded as a communist for seven years , can personally identify many hundreds of New York communists , most of them with her own photographic proof . It is admitted that the Attorney General and the FBI will have to weigh most seriously the question of how many additional undercover men they can afford to " expend " in enforcing the new law . Some hackers of the law admit that it may possibly result in endless litigation , in " an endless chase . " Even so , they say , it will keep the communists on the run , on the defensive ; it will keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for other mischief . It will turn the war of nerves against them . As for the long-drawn-out hearings , they will provide the public a continuing education in the true nature of the communist conspiracy . Critics of the law fear that it may subtly undermine freedom of speech . Men will become fearful of advocating even mild reforms ; they will not dare join any progressive group lest it be tainted . Backers of the law retort that you can be as radical as you please , so long as you are loyal to the United Stated ; that it is only proper , in times like these , that indiscriminate joiners stop , look and listen before they affiliate with any group which may be controlled by communists . I do not have enough space here to cover all parts of the law or give all the arguments pro and con . I have touched on the main issues and a few of the techniques of that dogged old net fighter , the Congress . In the long months or years before the first " final order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public , the courts and the Congress to decide whether this is a good law or whether the anticommunist net will have to be repaired or entirely rewoven.
