In the rarefied atmosphere of championship sports , few contests are more exacting or more dramatic than that classic of classics in the pageantry of the horse-show world , the international jumping competition . Framed in the ornate trappings of tradition , demanding the precision of a ballerina and the power of a pole vaulter , it is a trial which combines artistry and athletics in their highest degree , a field reserved by stern selection for a heroic few . Twice yearly , in Harrisburg , Pa. this week and in New York 's Madison Square Garden from November 5 to 12 , the U.S. plays host to those who have attained this perfection  --  and always present is the man who in 20 years of jumping has made himself the dean of competitors in this small elite , Brigadier General Humberto Mariles of Mexico . On the opening day at Harrisburg , when the teams from Canada , Ireland , England , Chile , Argentina , Mexico and the U.S. lined up in formal parade , Mariles was again there , resplendent in white jacket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a man , who rides like a lightning-crowned Jove. // The crowds know Mariles and love him . They know him from countless victories at Harrisburg and in the Garden , as well as from some spectacular defeats . They know him as an Olympic champion in 1948 and as a gallant loser four years later when a possible victory at Helsinki escaped him by an agonizing quarter of a point . They know him for his enthusiasm , his color , his blunt and forceful speech , which more than once has got him into political trouble at home . But most of all they know him as the indomitable competitor  --  the man who rode here in 1955 despite the crippling pain of a fractured vertebra at the base of his spine , the man who , win or lose , has always ridden out his course until the final obstacle is cleared . // This is the Mariles of legend , who has made the horse-show ring his world . Few know him out of it , or can even imagine what his life is like out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at home . Yet his is a rich life too , a life of children , horses , dogs , a wife as energetic as himself , a large and lively equestrian domain outside Mexico City , a life of teaching pupils old and young , of crises large and small , of strenuous activity and ebullient relaxation  --  the life of a dedicated and forceful man . In the course of a recent visit to Mexico , I spent a fortnight following the general on his daily rounds . It is a strenuous life  --  not only the general , but his wife and his children spend most of their time on horseback  --  but it is an experience , an experience in living . // The life of General Mariles is centered in the western outskirts of Mexico City . Here , where the crowded dual lanes of Highway 15 lead out from Chapultepec Park toward Toluca and distant Guadalajara , are the sprawling grounds of the National Equestrian Association , a sort of super riding club which the general oversees . Behind an ancient , high wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many horses . Across the road , in buildings considerably more imposing , are a dormitory for foreign visitors and students ( it used to house the general 's crack cavalry officers ) and a casino complete with restaurant , bar , lounge , billiard and ping-pong rooms . Near the gateway to the road is the general 's office , a small building where formerly he presided as an officer over cavalry affairs , now as a civilian over a civilian school . // But the most imposing part of the equestrian plant is its most important section : a huge ring forming a polo field , containing almost every conceivable type of obstacle that a horse could encounter in a show ring . It is complete with a grandstand and lights for night riding . On its outside perimeter are solid fences of all sorts and sizes , and beyond them still another outside course runs over rough terrain . A smaller ring , also well equipped with solid fences , rounds out an establishment that would set any horseman 's heart to skipping. // Some 10 minutes away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's home , a modern , one-story house and garden . Workmen were busy on it when we arrived near noon of a hot and sunny day , putting up a new roof , adding a wing . Already the general had put in the equivalent of a full day 's work for any average man  --  a couple of hours of methodical schooling of his horses over varied courses in the early morning , a brisk but thorough inspection tour of other horses in the stalls , a fast 45 minutes in his office dealing with correspondence , visitors , accounts and future schedules , a quick trip back to the course for more schooling with Chihuahua II , his current favorite mount . Now he was relaxing before lunch , thrown back in his chair , feet spread before him , oblivious to workmen , children , servants and all the other tumult of his lively home . // " When you are young , " he said , " as I was when I first came to the U.S. , you ride with your heart . Then around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43 , almost 44 . I have been riding for 30 years . Perhaps soon I should retire . The French have a saying . " He paused , searching for the translation . " It goes something like this : ' A man only begins to understand riding when it is time for him to stop . ' That is true  --  but , " he continued , " I am also sure that once a horseman stops competing , he stops learning . It is the end of the book . " // For Mariles , the book began when he was 12  --  and its first page was a story of rebellion . The son of an army colonel , he joined some students in his native state of Chihuahua in a strike against the government which had closed the schools preparatory to a reorganization of the nation 's school system . Mariles ' padre found his son 's protest against organized authority not only contrary to his own beliefs but downright dangerous in those revolutionary times , and he hustled young Humberto off to the army for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general recalled , " I hated it . I had never before been away from my mother and every night I cried . Then I started working with the horses . When my father , thinking I had probably learned my lesson , came to take me home , I would n't leave . I knew by then that I wanted to stay with the army and be with horses for the rest of my life . " // The general paused and glanced at the trophies that ranged the walls from floor to ceiling . " Things were very different then , " he continued . " There was little formal instruction . Then , in 1926 , in my first year with the army , General Amaro , the war secretary , decided that the standards of the cavalry should be improved . He sent officers to Europe to study for a year or two in all the well-known centers of riding- Italy , France , Spain , Germany . " He waved his hand at the trophies from all these countries on the walls around . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , naturally , each officer came back with a different set of ideas . Wherever I went in the next few years I was told something different  --  it was an equestrian Tower of Babel ! // " And look what happened ! " he continued in exasperation . " The three Mexican riders on the Prix des Nations team who were sent to the Olympics in Los Angeles in 1932  --  well , two of them were out at the first fence and the third went out at the second ! The whole world was laughing at Mexico ! I do n't care where you send your men to learn , but they must all learn one single set of principles , one doctrine , even if it comes from China ! " He waved his fist in eloquent determination . // The door burst open and a Weimaraner ran in , energetically wagging its rear end . " This is Henry , " the general explained . " He was given to me by a friend in Harrisburg . Si ? ntese ! " he ordered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's knee . " Well , " Mariles went on , " in 1936 , when General Avila Camacho was Undersecretary of War , he sent me along to Berlin as an Olympic observer . I decided that a composite of the various styles , based mainly on the Polish and German , would be best suited to Mexico . General Camacho thought I was right . Many others thought I was crazy . But Camacho never doubted me , and when in 1940 he became President , he ordered me , yes , ordered me put in charge of Mexican riding . " // By that time Mariles was already making a name for himself in the international horse-show world . His first appearance in New York , in 1939 , for example , turned out to be a moment with dramatic consequences not only for international riding but for Mariles himself . " I was only a captain in the cavalry then , " he recalled , " and I had been working with a little horse named Resorte . He was almost a pony , so small " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was so scrubby-looking that my commanding officer refused to let me bring him to New York . He was afraid it would be bad for Mexican prestige . As an army officer , I had to follow his orders ; as a horseman , I thought differently . I smuggled Resorte onto the train along with the other horses . // " When I got to New York , there was a telegram for me from my commander . He was very angry ; he warned me that I would answer to him for my disobedience when I returned . For me , this New York jumping was a matter of win or be court-martialed . " A happy grin spread slowly over the general 's face as he savored once more the tension of that ride . " The first event in my New York horse show was the Bowman Cup . There were 46 horses entered ; 43 competed . Resorte was the only one to make the course without a fault . The next day I had another telegram from my commander . This time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the general went on . " A story grew up about how I found this horse , a sort of legend  --  how he came out of the herd one day and put his head against my cheek . " He smiled . " Very nice , and I probably told it once myself . But to tell the truth , he did come out of the herd , but not to kiss me . He came because I got so mad at his bad behavior that I threw a rock at him . I hit him , too  --  and he jumped right over the corral fence . That fence was 6 feet high , and I knew I had a jumper . // " Resorte died just a few months ago  --  he was 31 years old . He was a great horse . " The door opened and Alicia Mariles , the general 's vivacious , dark-haired wife , came in with a pre-lunch-eon cocktail . A horsemanship teacher , too , she was still in her riding clothes . He waved a greeting to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on , inspired by a sudden idea . " A good horse is more difficult to find than a good wife ! I am a fortunate man . I have had both "  --  he smiled at Mrs. Mariles  --  " and besides little Resorte I have had Arete , who had only one eye , and now Chihuahua II . So many riders , you know , never get to ride even one great horse . Not even one ! " He waved a forefinger. // " Arete was killed jumping , " he continued . " But Chihuahua II  --  he is still young , and he is the best of all . You know why he is so good ? It is because he is a coward . He hates to hurt himself . He took 67 fences at Harrisburg last year before he touched one ! " // It was time for lunch now , a fact which was announced by the lively entry of the general 's three daughters , Vicky , aged 15 , Alicia , the 11-year-old who is nicknamed La Gorda ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their 17-year-old brother , Humberto , was away at military school ) . The general followed them into the dining room . There was an expectant wait as he strode to the head of the table and took his seat . With that , activity commenced . // Henry the Weimaraner , banned from the room by Patty , pushed the door open tentatively , spied his master and bounded to the safety of his side . Patty , with a scolding look at Henry , hurried up to fill the general 's glass with milk . The general fed Henry a banana . " I 'm not eating much , " he explained . " I never do before I ride . " He bit on a tortilla . " The Mexicans , " he went on , " are almost the only ones of the international teams who do not eat before they ride . " La Gorda and Vicky left their places to fetch from the sideboard some scale-model obstacles they planned to use as a centerpiece for the forthcoming Equestrian Ball . The general studied them critically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he picked up his thought again , " get indigestion for a different reason . " A maid appeared with a tray which was set down in the center of the table . The general fed Henry a tortilla . " They have read so much , " he went on , " about so many different styles that they can not digest it all . " Patty brought her father a platter of poached eggs . He kissed her on the cheek . Henry put a paw on the table and was roundly denounced for his bad manners . Conversation flew . The general mopped up his eggs with another tortilla . " Down , Henry ! " he shouted . Outside , sudden thunder rolled . // " Good Lord ! " Mrs. Mariles gasped . " What is going to happen to the ceilings ? We have no roof .... " The general calmly continued his dissertation on the American situation . " In no other country , " he said , " are there so many fine horses  --  the best in the world  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to make money that they will not spare the time and effort to train the horses and riders .... " Thunder crashed again , followed by the snare-drum tattoo of a downpour . A servant rushed by , carrying a pail and mop . " It is raining into the bathroom ! " she cried . Mrs. Mariles exclaimed in despair and , pushing back from the table , issued rapid commands . The general and the children scurried about the room snatching trophies from the walls . Plink , plonk ! The drops were already falling in the dining room . Plink , poing , ping ! They fell into the silver cups and bowls . The general stared in exasperation at the widening cracks in the ceiling . There was a crash of thunder , then a crash of plaster as a spot gave way . Lunch was over . // Politically , the strongest friend Humberto Mariles ever had was Avila Camacho , the man who , as Undersecretary of War , recognized Mariles ' abilities and subsequently , as President , saw his judgment confirmed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under Camacho , Mariles founded the equestrian school for army officers , whose international success was climaxed by the great Olympic victory of 1948 in England . That victory made Mariles a national hero . When Miguel Alem ? n became President in 1946 , Mariles continued to enjoy the benefits of favor in high places ; as an admirer and close friend , Alem ? n , too , gave him virtually free rein . But under President Ruiz Cortines , elected in 1952 , things have been different . No horseman , Cortines had little interest in the development of Mexican equestrianism , which was Mariles ' passion . As long as Avila Camacho was alive , however , the general was still assured of an influential voice in high official quarters . Then , one day in October 1955 , Avila Camacho died . // In less than a year , Mariles ' laboriously constructed equestrian empire crumbled and disappeared . The army jumping team was disbanded . Mariles himself was transferred from the cavalry to a meaningless job . Mexico went unrepresented in the 1956 Olympics in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the general was able to bring a scratch team , mounted on his own personal horses , to Harrisburg , New York and Toronto last year ( SI , Nov. 12,1956 ) . This year , too , the general remained in a military limbo , but he managed to stay in Mexico City and on horseback . And as technical director of the civilian-run National Equestrian Association , he won a quite different kind of recognition in his chosen field . By this summer , his children 's classes were drawing pupils to the riding club near Chapultepec from all over the country . // It was with one of these classes , later that day , that we were riding home , following an afternoon on the outside course of the school . // " I prefer to work with children now , " the general was saying . " They are not afraid and they learn so much faster . " He dropped to the rear as the group strung out in the rough terrain approaching the highway . " There is no fox hunting here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hounds , jumping anything that comes along . Instead , we organize cross-country rides " ( opposite ) . // Suddenly his attention was attracted by one of the club members riding in the nearby ring . " No ! No ! " he roared , " not that way ! " Abandoning his children 's class , he galloped alongside the boy . " What makes you think you are a horseman ? See ! " He motioned to his back . " Watch me  --  like this ! " He moved his horse into a slow gallop , slowly circling the rider . " Now make yourself heavy in the saddle as you approach the fence ... take the movement in your thighs , in the small of your back ... in your shoulders ... urge the horse with your legs , not with a whip . No wonder he refused ! " He changed his horse 's direction and sent him toward the fence . " Now ! " he shouted , " arch your back , lift your chin  --  you are light in the saddle ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See ? Now you try it . " The boy circled his horse around and put him over the fence . " Again ! " shouted Mariles . " Another time ! Again ! " After some 10 successful jumps Mariles allowed horse and rider to stop . " Let him walk a bit , " he grunted . " Next time , your horse will know that fence and you will know how to make him take it . " He rode back to his class . // The riders , relaxed and chatting , were just starting through a gap in a hedge , the horses with ears pricked in eager anticipation of the barn . Mariles ' daughter La Gorda was in the midst of them , happy as the rest at a good day 's work well done . Suddenly her horse , 14 de Agosta , in an access of playfulness , whinnied , tucked his head between his legs and bucked . La Gorda was thrown downhill , hard . // The general was by her side in an instant . Before his horse had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kneeling . " Move your arms , Gordita ! " he commanded gently . The child raised them up and down . " Now your legs ! " She bent one , then the other . " Now sit up ! " La Gorda rose and buried her head , sobbing , against her father 's shoulder . The general patted her back consolingly . Patty , her youngest sister and another member of the class , slid off her horse and put her arm around her . " ? Te duele mucho ? " she inquired . " Does it hurt badly ? " La Gorda nodded and rubbed her head . Patty stepped back to examine her older sister critically . " She 's not hurt ! " she announced . The general clucked reprovingly. // " I think maybe her pride hurts her more than her head , " he said . " This is the third time this horse has thrown her . " La Gorda began to cry again . " My head ! " she sobbed , rubbing her forehead . Patty again looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back ! " she said . La Gorda sobbed louder . " We will take her to the clinic , " said the general . // Phone calls were made , cars summoned . Vicky , back from the barns , also arrived . She , too , stared at her sister suspiciously but put her arm around her nonetheless and cushioned her head against her shoulder as they drove . The little procession entered the hospital , was ushered past roomfuls of waiting patients and into the X-ray cubicle . // La Gorda climbed to the table and loosened her waist-length hair . Her sisters started carefully picking the grass and straw from the thick blonde tresses while the general patted her shoulder consolingly . " She is n't hurt ! " said Patty again . " She just wants a Lambretta motor scooter like Vicky 's ! " La Gorda burst out sobbing again . // " There , there , " said the general . " Did the horse really hurt you ? " La Gorda nodded vehemently and whispered into her father 's ear . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // " I told you , " said Patty triumphantly . " She wants a Lambretta like Vicky 's . " " We 'll see , " said the general , with a smile . The doctor came in . Crisp and jaunty , he shook hands with the general and the children , then went to work with his equipment . // Ten minutes later , he was back . The general still stood quietly stroking La Gorda 's hair as she continued to sob weakly . The doctor waved the X-ray plates . " Absolutely nothing here ! " he announced happily . " She is only in a mild state of shock . Let her rest a few days to make sure  --  but nothing seems wrong . " Mariles clapped the doctor on the back . The doctor produced a framed photograph . " See , mi general , I used to ride too . " He handed the picture to the general . Mariles studied it . " You were very good , " he said graciously . " Your legs are just a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " // A gentle snore came from the couch . La Gorda , exhausted , had fallen asleep . The doctor winked at the general . " She was not hurt , " he said . " I thought not , " agreed Mariles , " but one has to be sure . She has not yet learned that a fall is no tragedy . I remember my last fall  --  Chihuahua put me down in Toronto at the Royal Winter Fair . I was circling the ring with the trophy I had just won when they turned the spotlight on us . Chihuahua thought it was something to jump , so he jumped . Was I surprised ! There I was , sitting on the tanbark , still holding that big , silver bowl ! " He walked over to the sleeping La Gorda and shook her gently by the shoulder . She woke up and buried her head against his chest , sobbing again . " There , there , " said the general . La Gorda raised her head and whispered lengthily in his ear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right  --  we 'll get you one too . " // Last spring the Mexican Equestrian Federation , the actual official representative of the nation at the International Equestrian Federation congress , decided to hold five tests of its own to select a Mexican non-army team . In an atmosphere of some tension , alert for any signs of unfavorable government reaction , the trials were held . Mariles entered , won and was appointed captain of the team . // With an entire summer to practice in , the general was ebullient about the prospects for putting on a worthy show north of the border this fall . He showed his confidence when , later that evening , he arrived with his family at the club casino , laden down with movie projection equipment and reels of film , to show and explain some of the victories of former years . " You may learn a good deal about jumping from these films , " he said . " I always have . And I have shown them many times to the members of my team this past summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we will do well . Anyway , " he added defiantly with a gesture that included all forms of higher authority which sought to keep him out of competition , " we will show them ! They may have the power , but I have the heart , and they can not break it ! " // The screen was set up , the first reel threaded in , the lights dimmed . " Now , " said the general , " we will look at what we have here . I study these films . I learn my mistakes and I analyze the different styles of riding . I changed my ideas on balance after watching movies of my daughter Vicky riding when she was 5 years old . " He clicked the projector 's switch . Nothing happened . He jiggled some wires and peered at the interior . He flicked the switch ; again . Nothing happened . Mariles turned away from the machine in disgust . " Wait , Humberto ! called his wife . She inspected the projector and pushed at a plug . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mariles explained , his good humor restored , " was taken in Rome in 1948 . Ha ! " he shouted , " There goes Raimondo D'Inzeo . Look at his elbows  --  now remember and watch how much better he is four years later  --  he became one of Europe 's great riders . But that year when I was in Rome one of the officers told me that I was the only one that really rode in the Italian style . " // The film whirred on as riders from assorted countries appeared . " Now this is me on Arete , " he continued . " Watch my legs  --  my stirrup is longer  --  the center of balance different . This way I can use my legs to help the horse , both on the take-off and landing . " The film ended with a Mariles victory . " The saddle , " he said as he readied the next reel , " is extremely important . In fact , I have designed my own saddle , and now people are writing to me from all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My saddle is short from pommel to cantle , and deep . This way one has the most contact with the thighs  --  and therefore better balance and security . " // Now the family settled deeper into their chairs , obviously expectant . They knew what was coming  --  the film of the general 's Olympic victory in 1948 . " Here first is a Chilean , " Mariles announced . " They believe that the rider 's body should be parallel with the horse 's neck . That is why they always fall off when there is any trouble . They are not deep in the saddle , so it is not a secure seat . " Several other riders made the course , drawing praise or criticism from the general . " Ha ! Here come the Russians ! " he exclaimed . " The Americans would like this film ... all three riders fall off . " There was a silence while the Russians made their appearance and fell off . " Now , " said the general , " here I come .... " His family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final outcome . // " See , " Mariles continued , leaning forward earnestly , " I headed for the center of that obstacle . It looks bad , but if you aimed there it was n't . Many riders did not realize that . Now this next one  --  it is harder than it looks  --  parallel bars always are . Now here comes the last one . " It was a brick wall , 6 feet high . Arete skimmed over . There was a general expulsion of breath . The film 's remaining footage was devoted to the pomp and circumstance that come with a great triumph . // Mariles was equally eager to show a film in which he was not the hero , but the reel taken at Helsinki was run in an atmosphere of anticlimax . " Now there goes Llewellyn , " explained the general , completely absorbed . " He is England 's best rider . He won . I do not care for his style , however . " He watched several more round the course . " Now here is Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer the way she rides ; in fact , she is among the world 's best 10 riders . " A Russian rider appeared . " See , they have improved , but they still have a long way to go .... Now , here I am on Petrolero . Watch ! " he announced objectively . " In a few seconds you will see where I lost the Olympics . " // Petrolero was obviously making a good round . He leaped the penultimate obstacle , rounded a turn  --  and slipped . Mariles slowed the film . " See ! It was the easiest fence on the course but I could n't get him back in stride . " In slow motion , after the horse had landed , the bar comes tumbling down . The family sighed . // But the general , keeping the film in slow motion , was already absorbed in the next horse . " Now look , " he continued . " Watch the horses when they jump . See how they change stride and get both hind feet on the ground to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many riders  --  even experienced horsemen  --  do not know this . They think a jump is just a part of the gallop stride . Now see how they land  --  always one foot only on the ground first . Then a split second later the other foot lands . That is why a rider must be balanced and ready to help a horse here . " // The film flickered to an end and Alicia Mariles snapped on the lights . " It is enough for tonight , I think , " she said . " We have many more  --  Spain , Argentina , France , the U.S. , the Pan-American Games . We learn so much from these . " Mariles stretched and patted Vicky on the head . " Yes , " he agreed , " soon Vicky will be ready  --  I have written Prince Bernhard , the president of the F ? d ? ration Equestre Internationale , and have asked permission for Vicky to compete before she is 18 . He has given his permission , and next year , with good luck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the team in the Garden . Then I will retire and she must try to better my record . " // He rose slowly from his chair and began packing up the projector , screen and reels . " You will see , " he said . " I know that this year we are facing the toughest competition we have had since the 1952 Olympics . But we may even have some surprises this year . Maybe we do n't always win , but we never disgrace the country . Once you are among the top 10 , winning and losing are part of the breaks of the game . But when they disbanded the team , " he went on , his voice rising in anger , " that was not part of the game ! " He pounded one fist into another . " And then we raised the money ourselves to send a team to the Olympics and they would not let us go ! They made us give it back . " A flash of his former anger returned . " People said I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me form my old team again . Apologize ? Why should I bow ? If I am going to be kicked in the tail , " said General Humberto Mariles with a growl , " it will be when I am standing up straight , not when I am bending over ! "
