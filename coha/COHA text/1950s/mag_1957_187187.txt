Almost everything has been tried for controlling the sex of unborn children , including the drinking by the woman ( while an abbot prays ) of thrice-blessed wine mixed with lion 's blood by an alchemist . The New York Daily News in its salad days even had a sex-control editor . But nothing worked . Parents who wanted boys got girls , and vice versa . <P> One of these days , science may come to the rescue . Geneticist Manuel Gordon of Michigan State University has succeeded in partially controlling the sex of unborn rabbits . His system depends on the fact that when a mammalian ovum is fertilized , the sex of the individual into which it will develop is determined by the sperm that does the fertilizing . Half the sperm cells have X chromosomes , which produce females . The other half have Y chromosomes , which produce males . So a way to start to control sex might be to separate the sperm cells into X and Y fractions before insemination . <P> To do this is quite a trick , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California in Berkeley . The two kinds of rabbit sperm cells look exactly alike , but there is nevertheless a slight difference between them . Dr. Gordon believes that the protein that coats them may not be identical . At any rate , the X and Y sperms behave differently when a gentle electric current is passed through a solution in which they are suspended . Under favorable circumstances , the X ( female ) sperms move toward the positive anode , and the Y ( male ) sperms move toward the negative cathode . <P> When the two kinds of sperm have separated as completely as possible , Dr. Gordon collects them and uses them to inseminate female rabbits . When left to themselves , rabbits produce about half males , half females , but the rabbits that Dr. Gordon inseminated with X sperm produced 80% females . His success in producing males was not quite so good , but in all seven cases where all the rabbits in a litter were of the same sex , that sex was the one Dr. Gordon intended . <P> Try it on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says Dr. Gordon : " Premature .
