Ten years ago , a gangling ball boy named Dick Savitt thought he was wasting his time fooling around on the courts of the Berkeley Tennis Club in Orange , NJ . He really wanted to be a big-league baseball player . Somehow it never worked out that way . Last week , some 3,000 miles from Yankee Stadium , Dick Savitt was still sidetracked from baseball , still up to his ears in tennis , but scarcely wasting his time . He was busy on the famed center court at Wimbledon , playing in the final round of the All-England championship . <P> It had taken him the whole ten years to get there . Playing between chores as a ball boy did not give Savitt ( rhymes with have it ) anywhere near as much practice time as the youngsters in the year-round California tennis foundries . At Cornell , where he majored in economics and became captain of the tennis team , winters are rugged ; Savitt 's tennis developed slowly , not nearly as fast as his heavyweight boxer 's body ( 6 ft. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junior year ( 1949 ) , slow-footed Dick Savitt won the Eastern Intercollegiates , mainly by overpowering his opponents , and was ranked 16th nationally . <P> Eager to Learn . Last year , as his footwork began to catch up with his booming power , Dick fought his way to the semifinals of the Nationals at Forest Hills . U.S. Champion Art Larsen stopped him cold , but Savitt was tagged as a comer , and ranked sixth . Last winter , Savitt went on a barnstorming trip to Australia.There he began to reach peak form , partly under the tutelage of Veteran Adrian Quist . Says Quist : " He was ceaselessly eager to learn and profited promptly from every fragment of advice . " Savitt crowned his tour by winning the Australian Championship. * In the four-set final , Savitt whipped young ( 22 ) Ken McGregor , who had clinched the Davis Cup last fall . <P> After that , Savitt began to brood about his game , went into a bad slump as he toured from Cairo to the Riviera , playing in minor European tournaments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drobny , 32 , beat him six out of seven times . In the recent French championships , against Drobny , Savitt was leading 4-2 in the deciding set when he blew up over a petty error and lost the match . <P> Ready to Score . But last week at Wimbledon , Savitt was at the top of his form , with everything under control . He swept Art Larsen in straight sets , 6-1 , 6-4 , 6-4 . In the semifinals he met his old nemesis , Herb Flam , who had beaten him twelve times ( but not this time , though the match went to five sets ) . In the finals , Savitt met Australia 's McGregor again . Savitt knew how to play McGregor : keep him away from the net , but avoid lobs , which McGregor usually kills with savage precision . <P> London 's Wimbledon gallery , the most knowing and courteous of tennis audiences , understandably tended to cheer for the Empire player from Down Under . But they had little to cheer about . Savitt 's flat , deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often left McGregor flatfooted . Savitt won in straight sets , 6-4 , 6-4 , 6-4-the shortest final ( 61 min. ) in memory . Only after the final point , in which McGregor sprawled helplessly after a whipping backhand down the line , did Savitt yank the emotional safety valve . Throwing his racket high in the air , he exploded in a fierce yell of triumph : " Yes-s-s ! " <P>
