In Colorado 's deep-slashed Las Animas River canyon two ancient locomotives were fired up until the safety valves were blowing under a full head of steam . Five cars were hooked on to one engine , two on to the other ; in addition , the locomotives carried 300 sticks of dynamite garnished with 30 Ibs. of black powder . Portentously , rom about a fifth of a mile apart , the panting engines began to roll slowly toward each other on the same narrow-gauge track . The engineers in the cabs pushed the throttles open , then jumped clear as the trains picked up speed . A few seconds later the canyon rocks reverberated with a thunderous blast as the iron horses collided headon . Scrap iron hurtled against the wooden barricades which protected the five cameras grinding away from different angles . Farther off , 300 railroad and film people cheered . As any small boy could understand , there may be something richly satisfying in the spectacle of two monsters bashing hell out of each other . <P> Thus , last week , the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climax of Paramount 's old-time rail saga called The Denver and Rio Grande . The D. &; R.G. itself donated the equipment , due for scrapping . Producer Nat Holt staged the wreck as a fictional incident of the railroad 's struggle with the Atchison , Topeka &; Santa Fe some 70 years ago , to push the first railway track through Colorado 's Royal Gorge . Producer Holt had only one misgiving about his $165,000 real thing : " It looks so good , people will probably think it was staged with miniatures. "
