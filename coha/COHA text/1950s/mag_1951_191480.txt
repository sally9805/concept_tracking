Britain recognized Red China more than a year ago . Red China has not yet recognized Britain . <P> Britain has opposed sanctions against Red China . Last week the House of Commons heard how Red China applies sanctions against Britain . <P> Conservative M.P . Fitzroy ( Escape to Adventure ) MacLean asked the government about the " closing " of His Majesty 's consulate at Tihwa , capital of Sinkiang , where China 's far west meets Russia and India . Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs Ernest Davies read from a report from H.M. 's consul general at Tihwa , George Fox Holmes : <P> " Search of all personnel and premises at Tihwa consulate took place on 4th and 5th December , 1950 . . . <P> " Thirty armed Red Chinese police took over , first searching both men and women after the removal of their outer clothing , then each room separately . This process lasted for 37 hours without letup , interspersed with interrogation , false accusations , and constant surveillance even to the extent of ladies being accompanied into bathrooms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before midnight on 5th-6th December the police departed , after obtaining ... signatures to the effect that ... we had been courteously treated throughout . . . Guards were left in the house and all consular personnel placed under house arrest . <P> " On 8th and 11th December , I was interrogated at length on ... Foreign Office . . . telegrams to me ; source of financial supplies ; reason for maintaining the attitude that I had the right to protect American property ... I was only allowed to return to the consulate after I claimed exhaustion had brought on a heart attack-my pulse being 140 per minute . " On 27th December I was called to the Central Police Office where an expulsion order was read to me only once in the following terms : I was guilty of espionage crimes against the Chinese and Russian people ... I , together with my family and staff , must leave China within five days . Only sufficient luggage for our immediate personal needs might be carried . . . <P> " We arrived in Peking on 30th December . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a whole day , we were taken to a filthy Chinese hotel for the night . At no time were we allowed to get in touch with H.M. 's charge d'affaires at Peking . On 31st December , we went by train to Tientsin under escort , were placed in the Rich hotel and not allowed to leave the bedroom or talk with anyone . . . We were then put on board the S.S. Heinrich Jessen for Hong Kong . " <P> Explained Minister Davies to M.P . MacLean : " Alleged charges of espionage . . . were quite incorrect and unjustified , and we are protesting to Peking against the expulsion . "
