If Guatemala 's anemic anti-Communist opposition still nursed the faint hope that President Jacobo Arbenz might become fed up with his Red allies and disavow them , that hope was blacked out last week by the most forthright pro-Communist declaration the President has ever uttered . In a 2 hour report to Congress on the state of the nation , Arbenz called the Communists " progressive democratic forces " and " the very wellspring of our regime . " He said that to turn against the Reds and repress them , as " certain landowner groups and agents of foreign monopolies " have urged , " would be ... suicide for Guatemala 's democratic revolutionary movement . " <P> As fruits of the Communists ' fertilizing friendship , Arbenz cited his . program of agrarian reform , " progress in reducing our dependence on foreign companies , " happily shrinking foreign investments , a new " freedom in international policy " and " to top it all , " the formation of a Communist Party , organized since his inaugural three years ago . Standing shoulder to shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they presumably wanted him to say about the conference in Caracas . " It is entirely up to Guatemala to decide what form of democracy she must have . . . The real issue at the Inter American Conference should be the common Latin American problem of economic betterment , so that we will not continue to be the objects of monopolistic investment and the sources of raw materials , selling cheap and buying dear from one of the countries of the American community . " <P> The bluntness of Arbenz ' speech left Guatemala 's opposition press in a state of mild shock . Impacto commented that in a nutshell the President 's speech amounted to : " Yes , gentlemen , organized Communism does exist in Guatemala ! So what ? "
