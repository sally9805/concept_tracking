Anna Christie ( by Eugene O'Neill ) seems to stumble after 30 years . It opens well , with one of O'Neill 's sharpest first acts , but it is not one of his good plays . Nor , even though it is due to move from the City Center to Broadway , is the present production any help : it stresses both the play 's age and the playwright 's streaks of adolescence . <P> Seldom was O'Neill more vividly theater-minded than at the start of Anna , where his bleary old barge captain excitedly awaits the daughter he has n't seen since her childhood ; and Anna slouches in at last , a tired tramp . But having beautifully set the table , O'Neill brings on chunks of the crudest realistic black bread , cups of the rawest romantic wine . After father meets daughter , Boy-in a sense-Meets Girl . Loving a wild Irish stoker . Anna must alienate him by confessing her past . But there is , if no assurance of happiness , at least a rather muddled happy ending . <P> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move at conflicting levels . Hence , after windy , uninspired love passages , O'Neill keeps writing harsh scenes that the play itself does not seem ready for . Anna is as much betrayed by the story as by Life . Both her washed-up father , cursing dat ole davil sea as a way of exonerating himself , and her lover , who should either be less Irish or more poetic , are hollow men who precipitate farce and even bathos . <P> Art Smith and Kevin McCarthy merely bang away at the two male roles . And Celeste Holm-a fine comedienne who is miscast-quietly fails in the role to which Pauline Lord , in 1921 , tremulously brought something of the tragic sense of life .
