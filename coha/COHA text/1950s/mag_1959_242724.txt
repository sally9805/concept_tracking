" This man may transform the medieval French retail trade along 20th century lines . " So said a high French government official last week of Edouard Leclerc , a young ( 32 ) , socially minded and devout Frenchman who is sparking a revolution in French food-selling practices . Leclerc , who started out by studying to be a Roman Catholic priest , changed his mind , and decided that he could help the poor more by donning a grocer 's apron and bringing down the cost of living . Nine years ago , with $40 , he opened a stall behind his house in Landerneau , near Brest , offering staple groceries only 8% above cost . Today some 30 Leclerc-sponsored groceries are operating in Brittany , Normandy and central France , and the movement is spreading over the nation . Recently , a rumor that a Leclerc store was about to be opened in Tours dropped food prices 20% . <P> Friends at Court . France has long needed an apostle in the grocery business . With 300,000 food stores , enough to serve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the French people are forced to pay among the highest food markups in the world . When Leclerc began offering 20% off on staple groceries , with up to 70% off on chocolates , razor blades and other specialties , his Landerneau competitors went to war to protect their entrenched position . They first spread false rumors that he was a tool of the church , French labor unions or the French employers ' federation . As customers continued to crowd his store , increasing his sales from $26,000 to $700,000 a year , his competitors sent anonymous letters to authorities charging that he was cheating on taxes , underpaying his help . Revenue agents established that he owed no taxes , was paying high wages . <P> His enemies figured out other ways to attack him . Wholesalers who had previously helped him asked him to take his business elsewhere . Said one : " I like your business , M. Leclerc , but every time I sell you 1,000,000 francs worth of goods , I lose 30 million in canceled orders elsewhere . " When things looked black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Economic Minister Antoine Pinay and other high officials saw in his crusade a way to raise French living standards without causing an inflationary wage increase , which they knew would only be soaked up in higher prices . The De Gaulle government used its emergency powers to pass a law making it a six-month jail offense for a wholesaler to discriminate against a retailer . <P> Oysters Leclerc . Last September authorities in Grenoble ( pop . 140,000 ) invited Benefactor Leclerc to open a store there to force down food prices , among the highest in France . Within a month the Leclerc store was doing a monthly business of $60,000 , improving the diet of Grenoble families with such unaccustomed luxuries as imported fresh oysters at 42 a dozen , against the usual price of $1.43 . Promptly , competitors encircled Leclerc 's store with six new cut-price outlets , dropped his volume to $24,000 a month . Said Leclerc : " I did not come here to make money but to bring down prices . Grenoble families are saving $160,000 a year through new lower prices . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he will teach his selling methods free . His only requirement : they must agree to hold to his policy of low overhead , minimum profit .
