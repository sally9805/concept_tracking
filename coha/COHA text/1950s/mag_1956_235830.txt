Trapeze ( Hecht-Lancaster ; United Artists ) . Less than a century after Phineas Taylor Barnum raised it high , the Big Top is folding all over the U.S. ( TIME , May 28 ) , and the Daring Young Man on the Flying Trapeze may soon pass into history with the flagpole sitter and the Human Fly . Trapeze is an attempt by Producer-Actor Burt Lancaster-who got his start in show business as an acrobat-to give the sons of the leotard what may prove to be their last fling in the big time . <P> Like every circus worthy of the name , Trapeze offers plenty of exciting sideshows , and the favorite distraction is sure to be Gina Lollobrigida , who keeps drifting across the screen in pretty , scant costumes . Gina is a lowly trampolinist who wants to fly high , and she keeps trying to climb the rigging with the " catcher " ( Lancaster ) in the aerial act , but Burt will not give her a tumble . He does all his catching on the high bar with Tony Curtis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Gina keeps pitching those curves , and pretty soon both Burt and Tony are grabbing at everything in sight . <P> The script , in short , is just a barrel of soggy tanbark , but there are plenty of comic spangles scattered through it-e.g. , the midget who is wakened every morning by the kiss of a giraffe , and the snake merchant who spends the better part of the picture polishing a lady python . <P> Invitation to the Dance ( MGM ) is the first feature-length ballet film that ever came out of Hollywood . It is also one of the few times since the movies found voice that the moviegoer has been offered a picture without dialogue . Indeed , the absence of what passes for human speech in most movie scripts will probably attract more customers to this show than the presence of well-known dancers ( Igor Youskevitch , Tamara Toumanova , Claire Sombert , Diana Adams , Belita , Carol Haney , Tommy Rail ) , who do not get much chance to strut their stuff . <P> The trouble seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art before the coarse . Gene Kelly spent more than three years in the production of this picture , and he had been thinking about it for a decade before shooting started . He devised the choreography , commissioned the music , directed the dancers and the camera , and he dances a leading part in each of the picture 's three episodes . Yet when it came to a showdown with his studio bosses , Showman Kelly was forced to play for the quick cash and let the enduring credit go . In the first of his danced playlets , however , Kelly manages to reach something not too far from the Diaghilevel , and that one effort should persuade the ballet enthusiast as well as the movie fan to accept his invitation to the dance . <P> Circus is a simple , romantic ballet , set to some suitable music by France 's Jacques Ibert , laid in a village square of placardized baroque , and dressed in costumes that suggest the saltimbanques of Picasso . It is pretty and sweet , but not too sweet . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggy white costume to open the program of a teatro circo , an Italian traveling circus . With the stilted gestures of mimetic tradition , he tells of his hopeless love for the leading lady of the troupe ( Sombert ) , hopeless because she loves the daring aerialist ( Youskevitch ) .
