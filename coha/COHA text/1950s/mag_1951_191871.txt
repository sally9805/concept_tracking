West Berlin police arrested them on charges of being members of the East zone 's Bereitschaften , the heavily armed shock troops the Russians were illegally organizing in the East zone ( TIME , June 12 ) . At their trial , two of the men turned state 's evidence . One of them , 21-year-old Heinz Nocht , gave Western intelligence a detailed picture of the new East German army , amply equipped by the Russians with Nazi weapons .
