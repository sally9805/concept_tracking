( See Cover ) <P> The country was not yet preparing for Armageddon ; it was merely trying to win a dirty , small-bore war in Korea . As of last week , before the President sent his message to Congress , even this effort was on a minor scale . For obvious reasons there was no thundering of a war machine : no thundering war machine existed . <P> Navy and Air Force lifted some of their World War II equipment out of mothballs . Aircraft companies began stripping plastic covers off old Corsairs , Hellcats , Bearcats , B-26s , B-29s . The Independence class carrier Bataan had been reactivated , modernization of the old ( 1942 ) Essex was stepped up to a round-the-clock operation . <P> These sounds across the nation were only an industrial murmur . The most reverberating martial noises came from the West Coast . For several days last week , vehicles rolled along Route 101 from the Marines ' Camp Pendleton to the Navy 's station at San Diego . Forty-five-ton Pershing tanks lumbered across the beach and into LCTs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack transports . <P> Transports were combat-loaded , i.e. , " backwards , " kitchen gear put aboard first because it probably would be needed last ; assault vehicles loaded last so they would be on top and could be spewed out onto the grey ships . On the quay stood a few tight knots of women . The men were the ist Provisional Marine Brigade , well-trained and well-equipped but fewer than 5,000 strong . Their commander told them : " There will be casualties among you . " At week 's end , heavily convoyed , the expedition departed . <P> Great Hopes . From West Coast ports sailed two carriers laden with planes . Farther westward , occasional warships crept into Pearl Harbor , vanished into the reaches of the Pacific . Through Hawaii flowed the other , inevitable , steady stream of war-commercial airliners out of the Far East carrying hundreds of civilian evacuees . Two airborne arrivals flew directly on to Washington . They were Generals J. Lawton Collins and Hoyt S. Vandenberg , chiefs of the nation 's ground and air forces , fresh from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sherman , was in Washington consulting with Congressmen . The day after the Korean Reds breached the 24th Division 's line along the Kum River ( see WAR IN ASIA ) , Collins and Vandenberg landed in Washington with this word for reporters : " Our troops are doing damn well and everything will come out all right . " <P> This was everyone 's great hope . But in the third week of the " police action " in Korea , with the policeman still being roughed up by the thugs he had gone to arrest , the details of just how the military expected to bring such hopes to realization were far from clear . <P> Nor was it clear just what had happened . Aside from the obvious fact that they were outnumbered , why were U.S. troops being pushed around in Korea ? Why were n't there more troops ? Why , after spending $50 billions in four years , was the U.S. so badly prepared ? Why was the machine so inadequate ? And now , how long would " this thing " last ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won - how much money , how many tanks , how many planes , how many men ?
