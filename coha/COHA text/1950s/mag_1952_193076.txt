With the Government 's blessing , New York 's tabloid News pulled the handle this week on what it called " the biggest jackpot in history . " The News began printing the names of thousands of New Yorkers to whom the Government owes nearly $5,000,000 in old income-tax refunds . <P> The News was carrying the names as a " public service , " but it was also a smart circulation stunt . The paper hit on the idea while getting together a series on income taxes a fortnight ago . When it heard about the unclaimed lode in a single district ( Manhattan 's Third ) , it sold the U.S. Treasury the idea of printing the names as an experiment in getting the refunds paid . The city desk assigned a special staff to compile lists of taxpayers owed $100 or more . The News expects to run the lists ( totaling about 6,000 names ) for almost two weeks . ( Its sister papers , the Washington Times-Herald and the Chicago Tribune , began printing their own lists . ) <P> The News plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any paper , thus hoped to find 1,500,000 taxpayers who are entitled to more than $44 million in refunds .
