Two weeks ago , ECAdministrator Paul Hoffman set out for Europe with the avowed intention of seeking some tangible : 1 ) abolition of double pricing ( one price for domestic consumption , another for exports ) ; 2 ) a new monetary clearing plan to provide Western Europe with a common payments system ; 3 ) appointment of an OEEC super-boss who could operate on the highest levels and get things done . His candidate for the job : Belgium 's ex-Premier Paul-Henri Spaak . When the meeting in Paris ' Chateau de la Muette broke up last week , Hoffman had suffered a grinding disappointment . <P> Chief opponent to Hoffman 's program was Britain 's Sir Stafford Cripps . Double pricing , said Cripps , could not be eliminated at this time . For example , with British general elections then only three weeks off , the Labor government was in no position to raise domestic coal prices . As to the European payments scheme , Cripps would have to study its impact on " the future of the sterling area . " When Spaak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cripps replied with a chilling no because Spaak had attacked Britain 's go-slow attitude towards European economic integration . The Netherlands ' handsome , beefy Dirk Uipko Stikker was chosen instead . <P> Once managing director of the famed Heineken Brewery Co. , 53-year-old Stikker made a name for himself as leader of Holland 's " Foundation of Labor , " a labor-management outfit which is largely credited with the country 's fine postwar record for industrial harmony . As OEEC " political conciliator , " his powers and duties are vaguely defined . " In the jargon of the organization , " Stikker quipped , " I might call myself a multilateral diplomatist . " <P> Back in Washington , an associate asked Hoffman how he made out in Paris . " You know that expression , Veni , Vidi , Vici ? " he answered . " Well , I made the first two .
