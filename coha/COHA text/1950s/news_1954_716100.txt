txt The Army , after weeks of hesitation , started tonight to present its side of the . tangled Peress case , Two high officials cited Army records to show that eight months ago Brig . Gen. Charles F. Craig , then Commanding General of Camp Kilmer , N. J. , had tagged Maj. Irving Peress a security risk and recommended his separation from the service . Approximately six months later Senator Joseph R. McCarthy made his accusation against the major and criticized the Army 's handling of the case . The Army officials argued that the Army had no feasible legal alternative but to grant Major Peress an honorable discharge . The officials also acknowledged that the Army had ignored Senator McCarthy 's request last Feb. 1 that the discharge proceedings be halted and the major held in uniform for trial by courtmartial . He became a civilian the following ; day . In laying some of its cards on the table for the first time , the Army admitted that certain aspects of the Peress case had bele poorly handled and that its procedures had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken were grounded in law , or Defense Department directives in force at the time , some of which have since been changed . The officials asserted that Dr. Peress , a Queens , N. Y. , dentist , had applied for and received a captain 's commission in the Army Reserve before his induction under the doctors draft law in October , 1952 . The chronology of his subsequent career , as presented today was this : OCT. ** filled out a regular loyalty questionnaire , claiming " Federal constitutional privilege " in declining to answer questions about his political beliefs and associations . The regular Defense Department Form 98-A that he used provides for such a reply in cases where the applicant might incriminate himself by answering directly . At that time Army policy was to require that the form be filled out only after the commission had been granted . NOV. ** Army revised that policy to require Mat loyalty forms be completed before commissions were granted . JAN. 3 , 1953 - Called to active duty , Dr. Peress reported to the Army Medical Center at Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His refusal to answer loyalty questions was unnoticed , the form he filled out not having been processed because of the normal delay in Army paperwork . JAN. ** was ordered to Fort Lewis , Wash. , for shipment to the Far East . FEBRUARY  --  His papers finally being processed , the Major 's loyalty reservations were noted and an investigation by the Intelligence Branch was started at First Army headquarters in New York . Because Dr .. Peress in the interim had been ordered to the West Coast , his file was sent on to the Sixth Army in San Francisco . The officer meanwhile , had applied for a compassionate transfer to the New York area on the ground that his wife and child were under psychiatric treatment and he was urgently needed at home . This being attested by two physicians and verified by - thae American Red Cross , his name was removed from the Far East shipment . MARCH 16 ? The transfer granted , Dr. Peress was assigned to Camp Kilmer for duty as a dentist . His personal file later followed him back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumed . JUNE , ** investigation was completed . On receiving an adverse report from the ? First Army , the Commanding General at Camp Kilmer recommended that he be separated from the service . Standard procedure requires that such cases be referred to the Army personnel board for evaluation . This was done and the board sent to Dr. Peress an interrogatary , citing the evidence against him and offering him an opportunity to reply . In filling out the interrogatory , the dentist again claimed " Federal constitutional privilege . " OCT. 23 , ** Peress was promoted to the rank of Major , in accordance with the law requiring adjustments in the grade of medical and dental officers to take into account their age and experience . This step the Army regarded as routine and , as far , as can be learned , the security aspects of the case were not taken into consideration at the time . NOVEMBER  --  The case went to the Army Department for action . The Army had three possible courses before it : ( 1 ) To seek a dishonorable discharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of officers that would consider his discharge " under conditions other than honorable " or ( 3 ) to take advantage of the regular procedures for a current reduction in force . It chose the later course , , for the following reasons : A dishonorable discharge , in the case of an . officer , can be issued only upon the approved sentence of a court-martial . A study of the legal precedents convinced tire Army that it had no evidence on which to prosecute successfully . It knew of no " overt act " during the Major 's Army career on which to base charges . It had lost a previous case involving an officer who had invoked the Fifth Amendment when questioned on loyalty matters . The Army rejected the second course because a " good defense counsel " could have drawn out the proceedings for six to twelve months and thus prolonged Major Peress ' service in the Army . It chose the third course as the swiftest and least complicated . DEC. 30 , ** decision was made to discharge him honorably , although Major Peress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term . The officer was notified that he could have ninety days in which to " process out " of the Army , the same period ' allowed to others terminated under the reductionin-force procedure . He had the option , and later exercised it , of choosing to leave the Army and forfeit his reserve commission in advance of the final deadline , March 31 , 1954 . JAN. ** McCarthy called Major Peress before a closed session of his investigating subcommittee in New York . The ' officer invoked the Fifth Amendment in declining to answer questions on his political activities and beliefs . FEB. ** dentist asked to be discharged immediately . His ' request was relayed from Camp Kilmer to the Pentagon , presumably by telephone or teletype , even as a letter was received from Senator McCarthy request- ' ing that he be held in uniform for trial by court-martial on the charge of " conduct unbecoming ' an officer . " ? Brig . Gen. Ralph W. Zwicker , new Commanding General of Camp Kilmer , had been authorized a month earlier to discharge Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision " was taken to . put no obstacle in the way of the discharge , despite Senator McCarthy 's request . FEB. ** Peress was honorably discharged . Robert T. Stevens , the Army Secretary , was in the Far East at the time . After his return he wrote to Senator McCarthy expressing his " regret that this case was handled as it was during my absence , " and adding : " An officer shoyd not get an honorable discharge from the service if he refuses to answer questions properly put to him by a Congressional committee . " Since his return Mr. Stevens has ordered several changes in Army procedures and regulations to avoid a recurrence . He has ordered , the officials disclosed , that no man shall be promoted while he is under investigation .
