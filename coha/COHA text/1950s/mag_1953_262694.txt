Wetherby exhibited truly remarkable restraint last week in the face of provocation calculated to send him and his state 's entire electorate into at least the milder manifestations of apoplexy : the Vicksburg Chamber of Commerce not only claimed that the mint julep was originated in Mississippi , but that Kentuckians never heard of it until both the recipe and the mint had been transplanted there by a bourbon-drinking boatman . But though Kentucky 's governor spoke softly , he did not fail to slip Mississippi a mickey . <P> " I thought , " said he , " that we were at peace , Kentucky with the mint julep and Mississippi with the planter 's punch . Kentucky has never questioned Mississippi 's glorious heritage as the originator of planter 's punch . That drink is not without merits , either .
