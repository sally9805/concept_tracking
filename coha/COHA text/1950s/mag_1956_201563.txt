The case for the Administration 's farm program as detailed by President Eisenhower in Peoria : <P> <P> FOR almost ten years , as farmers ' costs have gone up , year after year , farm prices have gone down . There are two exceptions when prices went up . One was the tragic year when the Korean battlefields provided the kind of market that no one wants . The other is this year . And this year there is no war . <P> Now what mainly caused that long , discouraging decline ? One thing only : political expediency in Washington , D.C. . . . And what were the results ? For one , Uncle Sam himself took up farming . Synthetic farmers behind Washington desks started telling farmers all over again what crops to plant , how much to grow ... the prices to charge . You know , farming looks mighty easy when your plow is a pencil and you 're a thousand miles from the cornfield . . . The value of the Government stockpile of farm surpluses climbed to $9 billion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it going to the farmers and with farmers helping to pay the bill . And these surpluses , by holding down farm prices , last year cost farm people some $2 billion . <P> Head-On Attack . I 'd say we have come pretty far in 45 months . . . We freed peacetime agriculture from programs designed for war . We eliminated Stirling wartime controls . We attacked the menacing surpluses-head-on . We regained many of the lost markets . We helped the lowest-income people in agriculture . We brought social security for the first time to operators of family farms . We refunded to farmers the $60 million-a-year federal tax on farm gasoline . We started the great St. Lawrence Seaway project-the 30-year dream of Midwestern farm families . . . And we turned prices back up-without a war . <P> I have two things to say about this beginning . First , the old price-depressing Democratic farm program stayed in effect right up to harvest last year . . . Eighty-five per cent of the price decline after the Korean war inflation came while rigid price supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mess that they themselves left behind . <P> Second , recent developments prove that the clean-up part of our job is well on its way . . . Part of that assurance comes from our new soil bank . . . This year the soil bank is retiring over 12 million acres and earning 500,000 farmers more than $260 million . When next year it retires 40 million to 50 million acres , overproduction will start coming under control . That means better times for every farmer . <P> Parity in the Market Place . Full income parity is a full share in our country 's good times . In a free agriculture , farmers can attain that kind of parity only in the market place . That 's what I spoke for at Kasson four years ago : the attainment of that full share for the farmer . . . That 's what I have been working for . I shall keep on working for it . And the facts show good progress .                @ @ @ @ @
