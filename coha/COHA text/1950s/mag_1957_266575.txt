Shortly after 10 o'clock one morning last week , a frail man in a light grey suit stepped out of a Soviet-built IL-14 transport onto the tarmac of Belgrade 's Zemun Airport . Dutifully , the visitor surrendered himself to a welcoming bearhug from his stocky , sun-bronzed host , accepted bouquets from four dewy-eyed young Pioneers , and acknowledged the salute of a snappy , blue-uniformed honor guard . Then Poland 's Wladyslaw Gomulka and Yugoslavia 's Marshal Josip Broz Tito headed off across the Yugoslav capital in a motorcade whose first three cars were a Rolls-Royce , a ZIS and a Cadillac . <P> Tito and Gomulka had not seen each other since March , 1946 . A year later , the satraps of the Soviet empire held a secret Cominform organization meeting in a sanatorium near Wroclaw , Poland . At that meeting , Tito and his aides vigorously berated Gomulka for talking too much about a separate " Polish road to socialism . " Barely a year later , Tito was the archrenegade of the Communist world . And before long , Gomulka , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as secretary-general of the Polish Communist Party and put under house arrest . <P> Dress Optional .

From the crowds that cheered Gomulka through Belgrade came shouts of " Welcome to Poland 's Tito ! " Catering to the simple tastes of his guest , pomp-loving Marshal Tito even abated somewhat the imperial splendor of his parties . ( " Comrades who do not have a dinner jacket will be welcome in a dark suit . " ) They adjourned to the Adriatic island of Brioni , where Tito lives it up in one of Mussolini 's old playgrounds . <P> With a nervous eye on Moscow ( whose press gave the meeting minimal coverage ) , the two " nationalist Communists " said nothing aloud to offend the Russians . Gomulka was careful to pay thanks to " the heroic Soviet army " for Poland 's liberation from the Nazis , and to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yet the fact of their meeting was evidence of more cracks in the once monolithic unity of Kremlin Communism . <P> <P> To get off on the right foot , Tito characteristically hit on a diplomatic device that cost him nothing at all . At a luncheon for Gomulka , Tito blandly wound up a lengthy toast with the statement that he considered " the present Polish-German frontier on the Oder and the Neisse the only lasting solution .
