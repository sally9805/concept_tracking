txt Boston 's well-advertised airraid test today was considered by civil defense leaders as a success in indicating that citizens Greater Boston ( Civil Defense Region 5 ) are trained in their reaction to a warbling siren blast . The test showed , too , that in this type of " safe " raid , present teams of regular and - auxiliary police are capable of handling traffic . clearing the streets for emergency service vehicles , and in directing pedestrians marked shelter areas . How well an unscheduled test can and will be carried out and how responsive motorists and traffic would be to police and wardens if air-borne danger were reported at hand remain unanswered questions . Also tested today was the network of sirens and whistles now installed in the 42 cities and towns in the region . As in earlier raid tests , it was noticed that many persons took advantage of prior knowledge of the " raid " and avoided being caught by sirens on the streets . Still others apparently left autos at home to avoid being caught without a parking place when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come . Now with at least one question answered ? that Greater Boston citizens do know what to do when they are " alerted " ; that they should seek shelter and keep streets clear  --  civil defense leaders are free now to ask more searching queries . How many citizens . they may ask , know how to attack a small fire caused by bombing ? How many can administer first aid ? How many know where to contact defense leaders after an all clear has sounded , so that available manpower  --  and woman power  --  can be harnessed as a team ?
