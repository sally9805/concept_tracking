txt Will the Asian peoples and those of other underdeveloped regions sink under spreading Communist waters ? Is United States policy hamstrung by alliance with colonial powers , shortsighted , and inadequate ? These hard questions are being asked in Washington after the Indochina setback and as British Prime : Minister Sir Winston Churchill and Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden land there . And with a French Indochinese settlement on undesirable terms possible despite ** of United States aid , more Americans are ready to believe former Ambassador to India Chester Bowles when he says there is little the United States has done light in Asia . He said it again June 24 at the reunion of the Nieman Fellows at Harvard University , and went on to lay out it hat he thinks American attitudes and policies should be . It is an approach that somehow would divorce the United States from the colonialism , past and pres , ent , of its indispensable Western European allies . Keyed to Self-Help Economic and technical aid bases the Bowles formula for success in Asia  --  aid distributed not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &victual; self-respect and a sense of national pride . The Soviet Union and its manipulators gate strong indications recently they are embarking on a large Communist " Point Four " operation of aid to ha% e-not nations . Mr , Bowles forecasts this will be well along in a few years and that if the United States does not gn e mole attention to this type of program Americans will wake up one day to discover thatagain ? to their vast amazement a match has been stolen on the West in Asia , The Sot lets now have entered a $30,000,000,000 three-ttiir ex-passion of their industrial facilities . At the end of that time , asks Mr. Bowles , wo n't it be easy for them to shunt $2,000 , - 000,000 or $3,000,000,000 of the product into such neutral countries as India . Burma , Ceylon , and Indonesia " And , he asks , why not South America too ? Bullets Overemphasized ? He reminds the American people that the $2,000,000,000 of Indochina aid that " went down the drain " is probably more than all the money spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1949 . His thesis : Americans have depended too much on armies and bullets in Asia . He took Indochina as a classic example of the failure of an American policy tied to an active , diehard colonialism . Three lessons were drawn by Mr. Bowles from the fiasco in Indochina . Lesson Colonialism does not wink any more . Lesson 2 ? Military might alone does not work any more . ( He reminds Americans that millions of tons of American military equipment and ammunition sent to the French and Vietnam last y ear compared to 12,000 tons of Communist Chinese aid to Vietminh . Yet the Vietminh ate on the verge of a decisive victory in Indochina . Lesson 3 : India and the other uncommitted nations of Asia now see more clearly than before that communism is an expansive , aggressive , power-hungry force . d Urgent  --  Now But he cautioned , in effect , fear of Communist imperialism in Asia is not enough . " Real support now " is needed for the third-bloc nations . Support , that is , in the form of community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The giving , he is sure after 18 months in India and Asia and in close contact with their people , must be unobtrusive , modest in spirit , in a genuine mood of interest in these peoples as people  --  dealing with them as equals always . Unless this is done soon in this way , it is Mr. Bowles ' opinion that " it may cost us our civilization . " By this he means that if India , for example , should go under the global balance of power would drastically and perhaps hopelessly shift . He asked , would Africa and South America be far behind ? Nippon Trade Accented Japan , he believes , may swing heavily toward trade and friendship with Communist China unless there is a massive revival of its trade , or a massive program of aid . Indonesia with its 80,000,000 people Is also in a marginal state , in his opinion , and is being largely ignored by the United States , going eight months recently without a United States ambassador and other key diplomatic contact men , This message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent to a nonpartisan way , often criticizing the former Democratic administration too , is deeply felt . He reminds Americans their heritage and their instincts are basically " in tune with the times , " that they soon must find some way of divorcing themselves from the bad taste left by the West for almost 300 ' years in the mouths of Asia .
