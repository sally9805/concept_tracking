In the 1930s and 1940s , Rufus Stanley ( " The Coach " ) Woodward of the New York Herald Tribune , one of the burliest ( 230 Lbs. ) sports writers and editors in the business , won a reputation as one of the best . When not engaged in playful mayhem-one favorite game of his was to sit across the table from some Spartan friend , trading shin kicks and guzzling highballs to numb the pain-he was busy beefing up the Trib 's sports section , with a canny eye for talent . It was Coach Woodward who hired Sports Columnist Red Smith away from the Philadelphia Record in 1945 . " I was also an awful popoff , " said Woodward . <P> After Owner-Editor Ogden Reid died in 1947 , popping off went out of style at the Trib . Classmates of Whitelaw Reid ( Yale ' 36 ) , Ogden 's son , began showing up on the payroll-even on Woodward 's staff . In 1948 , during an economy wave , the management suggested that Woodward trim off a few sports hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Red Smith and me . " Not long after that , Whitelaw Reid found a name for the trim list : Rufus Stanley Woodward . The new sports editor was Robert Cooke ( Yale ' 36 ) . <P> Last year , when John Hay Whitney , U.S. Ambassador to the Court of St. James 's , took control of the Trib , the management began to take a different approach to hiring , firing and promotion . Fortnight ago , with enthusiastic staff approval , Day City Editor Richard West ( Harvard ' 29 ) , a veteran Trib hand who had been passed over for promotion three times , was moved up to the city editor 's slot . Last week Executive Editor George Cornish-the same man who fired Woodward for " Whitey " Reid in 1948-fired Sports Editor Cooke . His successor : Rufus Stanley Woodward ( Amherst ' 17 ) . After leaving the Trib in ' 48 , Woodward had drifted through a series of jobs , freelanced a bit , wound up as sports editor of the Newark Star-Ledger . Aging ( 63 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ) , the Coach found the sudden vindication almost too much to take-and maybe a little late . " I just feel sort of sunk , " he said , getting ready to go back . " It 's been a long , long eleven years , and I 'm wrung out like an old sock . "
