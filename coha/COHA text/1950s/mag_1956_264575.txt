What do surgeons say during an operation ? In the Hollywood version their speech is tense , clipped . A new recording by Folkways Records of an actual operation in an eastern U.S. hospital shows that , in reality , surgeons sound like expert mechanics bent over a balky V8 . Thus : <P> An older surgeon is supervising a young surgeon in an operation to remove a cyst from a small boy 's neck . He keeps repeating phrases like " spread and cut " or " stay close to the object you 're removing " to impress operative technique on his charge . " What are you scared of ? " he needles the young surgeon . " This is lots of fun . " <P> When the novice hesitates to make the kind of sharp , precise cuts that the body can heal most easily , the old one remarks caustically : " Now we 're back to pecking and scratching . " When something seems to go wrong , he cries bluntly : " Grab the damn thing-with something-not with the scissors ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old one rumbles : " Now you 're cooking . " <P> The old one wonders why a certain anesthetic is not used more often , and the young one chuckles : " It causes bleeding . So do we . " Suddenly , the senior surgeon explodes : " Can we get that damn light a little better ? It 's not satisfactory . . . Holy suffering Moses ! Now it 's all dark ! " <P> The boy with the cyst made a perfect recovery , left the hospital in three days .
