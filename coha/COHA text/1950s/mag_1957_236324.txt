Britain 's 30-day war in the Oman desert sputtered to an end last week with the destruction of the last remaining mud-walled rebel forts , and the flight into the mountains of the rebel Imam of Oman himself , his rascally brother Talib and their only remaining ally of any note , one Sheikh Suleiman bin Himyar , who styles himself " Lord of the Green Mountains . " The rest of the Imam 's tatterdemalion forces fled off to fend for themselves . Total casualties among the forces of the British and the Sultan of Muscat and Oman since the counteroffensive began : one dead , three wounded , seven cases of heat prostration . Rebel casualties were unknown , but probably amounted to not more than 40 or 50 killed and wounded . <P> " The operation has been successful , " declared British Brigadier J.A.R . Robertson . " We have reinstated the Sultan 's forces . Political control is developing . " To make sure that the right kind of " political control ' ' continues to develop . Britain will maintain an airstrip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops . <P> In Bahrein , British army spokesmen quoted captured Omani rebel troops as saying that 400 of the Imam 's recruits had been trained for seven months near Dammam in Saudi Arabia . British officers on the spot identified captured rebel grenades as U.S.-made , implied strongly that they , like the recruits , came from Saudi Arabia . Also picked up in the rubble : two British naval cannon dated 1646 . The U.S.-made grenades , along with the rebel prisoners ' admission that they were trained in Saudi Arabia , may be used to counter Arab charges of " aggression " by Britain if the Arabs try to put the issue on the U.N . ' s agenda .
