txt Dear Boss : Have you seen anything of a man named Adlai E. Steven-son ? I am supposed to be covering him , but he has got away from me . In the past three days he has been campaigning in thred-Siates , and I have often been in the saute state  --  wl th him . He is a man with a prominent nose , a rather dumpy figure , and a big , ? bright smile . He is an ? agreeable fellow to have around , because he makes entertaining comments . But he is n't around very much so far as newspapermen go . The last time I saw him he was in the gym of Davis and Elkins College of Elkins , W.Va. , with a beauty queen and a lot of other people . He was making a nonpolitical speech on conservation , and nobody could figure out quite why . He seemed to be at a loss , too . After that he got away . I and some 90 other members of the press , photographers , and staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but we never did catch up , because you see , Boss . he was flying . We think he was flying for New York . He was supposed to address a rally at 116th Third Avenue in New York at 9:30 p.m. , and Harlem 20 minutes later . Could you tell me if he made it ? We did n't . This is going to be hard to explain , Boss , but I will try . I guess I had better go back a bit and take a deep breath . WelL  --  you remember , we all started out.merrily across New Jersey in a motorcade . It was only last Tuesday , but it seems months ago . Crowds were disappointing , but at least we were always within a mile or two of the candidate and occasionally right up with him . That was true the ( first night at Jersey City , where Mayor John V. Kenny , inheritor of the Hague " I-Am-the-Law " machine , who appears to have stepped out of " The Last Hurrah , " put on a rally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky was clear . I want you to fix your attention on that , please . I 've Seen Everything Now ' Well , this Kenny show was something to see . He wears a pearl stickpin , and is not the kind of gentleman I would want to run against , Boss , for anything . There is a certain glint in his eye . He is quite articulate , too . He addressed his followers from the platform of Public School No. 12 like a tribal leader . He said Hudson County has the best " rough-and-tumble political workers in the country , " and warned precinct captains that he wanted no nonsense come Election Day . He was interested in results , not explanations , and he expected them to " deliver . " " Well , " observed Mr. Stevenson when he was introduced , " I think I 've seen everything now . " It was next day that somebody stole our train . This is ? really going to be hard to explain . I will take another deep breath . Practically anything can happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mr. Stevenson . Islo n't  --  mean the Stevenson mimeograph machine that wo n't print the letter " 0 " and the letter " D. " And I do n't mean the Republican baby that always seemed to cry at the outdoor rallies . What I mean is that stealing a train is ' another matter . You see , we boarded this train that Tueiday night in Jersey City , and , oh , it was good to get back onto an old-fashioned campaign train again after all this airnlAnes hedgehopping and motorcadincr . Well , it took us out into the Poconos sorricwhere that first night , and stopped and gave us a wonderful sleep ; and when I woke up next morning there was a field and a bush . all aflame just outside the window of Car 8 . Roomette I. The sky was blue , too . Fix your attention on that . Our mistake was to leave the train that morning to motorcade into Sunbury , Pa. , while the engineer switched it around somehow by another route . Sunbury is a lovely old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , built in 1865 , all covered with Eisenhower banners . But when we walked to the old-fashioned station , where the tracks run right down Main Street , with shops on either side , there was no train . What Happened to ** Train ? The neighbors all closed in around Adlai , and the affair got folksy . But , somehow , after half an hour or so of that on a tight schedule , you get to wondering . What had happened to a 15-car special train  --  the one with the private car at the end that used to carry Woodrow Wilson ? Adlai kept up a brave smile , but it is awkward to stand trying to look composed on a public platform when you are an important man . When the engineer showed up , he said he had been " delayed . " He even denied that the train had been stolen . Well , that night , Oct. 3 , was the first time we lost our man . He gbt away . He decided to make a quick detour into Pittsburgh by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard it , Boss . I did n't . You see , we stayed on the train and somehow had to from Johnstown , Pa. , to Elkins , W.Va. , that night . So while he was speaking we were traveling . All the reporters who were supposed to be covering him were off somewhere in the mountains . The train 's television could n't get him . The radio could n't get him save at the end ( and never when we went under bridges ) . Oh , you have no idea at all , Boss , what it is to try to cover Mr. Stevenson ! This is getting to be longer than I expected ; but next morning in West Virginia it was raining . Did 1 tell you to fix your attention on the weather ? Well , the first thing I knew , he hats got away from us . He was on a special plane for . Pittsburgh . He was trying to reach New York in time for those speeches . No more planes for anybody . Have you ever been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In practically no time at all ( if you . do n't count . a couple , of hours-of repiriMg and ? teeth-gnashing ) , the 90-of us-were following Mr. Stevenson to Pittsburgh at a 20-mile-an-hour clip in three old buses . The foliage was lovely . We did n't look at it . The wire service men were the most unhappy . They are net ? suppos2d to let a candidate out of , sight . We had a Western Union man on board , bilt no place for columnists and assorted journalists to throw off copy . " You got raincoats for your carrier pigeons , Dave ? " we asked . ( When anything goes wrong you blame Western Union . ) " You going to send smoke signals ? " Too Wet for Smoke Signals " Ca n't send up smoke signals , " replied Dave Rush judiciously . " Leaves are too wet . " Well , that 's the story . Three big " Stevenson-Kefauver press " buses wallowing through the night , behind a police car , suddenly pouring out all their passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them and , on board , eating candy bars , popcorn , and gumdrops , at a quarter-in-the-slot place , washed down with milk from containers which somebody providentially discovered . Have you seen a man named Adlai E. Stevenson ? ? Here I am at the Pittsburgh Airport , and they are turning off the lights . They may or may not get me onto that next flight to Washington . As I said before , almost anything can happen on a campaign trip . As I sit writing this , I have a feeling that more of them happen to the Stevenson campaigning trips than to most . Respectfully , R. L. S.
