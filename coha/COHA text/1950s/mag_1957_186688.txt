When courtly Antonio Segni was named Premier of Italy in July 1955 , Roman wags , who did not expect his government to survive the summer , promptly dubbed it " the seaside Cabinet . " Last week when Summer Premier Segni finally handed in his resignation , he had been head of Italy 's government for 22 months-longer than any Premier since Alcide de Gasperi . <P> When Segni took office , the four-party coalition which had dominated Italy since 1953 was falling apart . Wispy-white-maned Antonio Segni , who looks like a Shakespearean bit-player on short rations , seemed the last man in the world to repair it . To everyone 's surprise , he promptly staged one of the most skillful displays of dosaggio ( division of offices among rival factions ) in postwar Italian history , not only revived the coalition but even managed to push through Parliament a series of overdue measures . <P> Ironically , the ultimate causes of Christian Democrat Segni 's downfall were de-stalinization and Russian brutality in Hungary . As the strength of the Italian Communist Party waned under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four center parties-the obvious need for " democratic solidarity " against Communism . Two months ago , convinced that the time had come to look out for its own interests in next year 's general election , the tiny Republican Party withdrew its support from the government . The Vice Premier Giuseppe Saragat , who controls a pivotal 19 seats in the Chamber of Deputies , found himself losing control of his Social Democratic Party to young firebrands who wanted the Social Democrats to pull out of the government and rejoin the Red-tainted Socialist Party of Stalin Prizewinner Pietro Nenni . <P> Saragat , a staunch antiCommunist , who is not satisfied that Nenni has really broken with Moscow , managed to resist the pressure until last week . Then , seizing on the behind-scenes maneuvers of Italy 's President Giovanni Gronchi ( who not long ago outraged the Segni Cabinet by proposing to send a neutralist letter to Ike ) , Saragat suddenly charged that within the Christian Democratic Party itself there were forces guilty of " silent hostility " to Segni 's pro-Western foreign policy . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Democrats have kept the faith . Now we must withdraw . " Left with only 275 out of 587 Deputies , Segni had little choice but to resign . <P> " I would like to return to my students , " said old Professor Segni with a broad smile . For the moment , President Gronchi and resigned Premier Segni ( who may be asked to serve again ) were too busy welcoming French President Ren Coty to Rome to give any attention to forming a new government . Though Coty 's state visit caught them in a Cabinet crisis , Italians were not embarrassed . " After all , " said a Roman politician , " Coty is a Frenchman . He will understand .
