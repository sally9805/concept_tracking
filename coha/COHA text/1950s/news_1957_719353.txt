txt Representative Mills of the House Ways and Means Committee is a man who likes to mix a bit of sweet with his bitters . So while he was soberly telling us we can forget about tax cuts - next year because of increased Goverrunent spending , he added that the Treasury will soon be running a surplus because of increased Government spending . If you have trouble grasping this last idea it 's only because you do n't think cheerful thoughts . What cheers Mr. Mills is the realization that every time the Government spends a dollar , it hikes its tax revenue at the same time . Ergo , the more it spends the more it collects . Let 's say the Government spends 51()0 more in wages to a clerk in the Pentagon . The clerk pays taxes on this ; a minimum ' of about S20 . The clerk takes the remaining S80 and pays the butcher or the grocer , who in turn pays part of it back to the Government in taxes . And so on . In feet , if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax-man takes a bit , the Government may end up getting half of it back . Now it 's obvious that if the Treasury gets $50 in this fashion , it has $50 in tax revenue that it would n't have had if the Government had n't spent theding Thoughts money in the first place . Ergo , just as Mr. Mills suggests , the more the Government spends the more the Government collects . Adding all this up , Mr. Mills told the American Tax Foundation that expanding Federal expenses for the defense program could very well produce an " impressive " surplus in the Federal budget during the next few years . Mr. Mills agreed that the surplus would be temporary because of the sad fact that to get this additional $50 in revenue the Government would have to pay out $100 . This would leave the Government $50 in the hole , and the problem would be where to get the other S50 to make up the S100 it paid out to get the extra S50 of revenue . But we have the answer for that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . From this the Treasury gets back $100 , which is just what it needed . If by now your head is beginning to swim a bit . do n't blame it on the Congressman . The basic idea was thought up long ago by some learned politicaleconomists who embodied it in a formal theory . This theory is that the Government can spend us all into prosperity and end up with a balanced budget besides ? if the money can just be ground out fast enough by the mills of the spenders .
