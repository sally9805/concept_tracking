In the chancy movie business , a producer without distribution is like a camera without film . Ever since it was set up in 1919 by Mary Pickford , Charlie Chaplin , Douglas Fairbanks and D. W. Griffith , United Artists has been a distributing outlet for independent moviemakers . It permitted them to break away from the domination of the big studios and take a chance making their own movies . <P> In later years , United Artists came upon hard times chiefly because Owners Pickford and Chaplin could not agree on how it should be run . On top of that , the postwar movie slump killed off many independents , and few exhibitors wanted the small number of third-rate movies U.A. could get . By 1950 the debt ridden company was losing $70,000 a week , and seemed ready to fall into bankruptcy . <P> Hard Bargain . As a last resort , Partners Pickford and Chaplin turned to a lawyer named Arthur Krim , now 42 , whose New York firm of Phillips , Nizer , Benjamin &; Krim specialized in movie litigation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review , graduated ( Phi Beta Kappa ) at the top of his class in 1932 , and gone immediately into law practice During World War II , Krim , commissioned a lieutenant colonel , served as assistant to Under Secretary of War Robert Patterson . At war 's end , Krim was named president of Railroader Robert R. Young 's Eagle Lion Films , Inc. , a film producer , left when it began it fade away , and went back to his New York law firm . <P> When United Artists finally came to him in February of 1951 , Krim drove a hard bargain . His terms : he would pay no money for control of the company ( though Mary Pickford said it was worth $5,400,000 ) ; if the company should show a profit in any one of the next three years , Krim 's control would be extended up to ten years , and half the stock would go to him and Law Partner Robert Benjamin . <P> To get the company on its feet , Krim got a $3,750,000 loan from Walter E. Heller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares of U.A. stock , which he used to lure a crack management team from other studios . He also began buying up all the movies available ( e.g. , Eagle Lion 's library of 200 films , including The Red Shoes ) , and guaranteed exhibitors 36 pictures a year . <P> Hard Cash . Within ten months the company was turning a profit . Krim and Benjamin thus got half the stock , and Krim the right to vote 100% of the stock until 1961 . Last year , through such moneymakers as The African Queen and High Noon , United Artists ' profits climbed fast . Last week pictures distributed by United Artists got 17 nominations for Academy Awards . United Artists is also a front runner in the three-dimensional race , having bought Arch Oboler 's B'wana Devil for $1,750,000 . The picture has already grossed about $1,000,000 in only 15 showings . On a take of 30-70% , depending on the movie , Krim expects United Artists ' 1952 gross profits to hit the $30-million mark .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
