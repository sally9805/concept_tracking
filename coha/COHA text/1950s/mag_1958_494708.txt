Today 's " One-Third of a Nation " by HELEN HILL MILLER FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT , in his second inaugural , made a national issue of the fact that a third of the nation was " ill-housed , ill-clad , ill-nourished . " That was 21 years ago , and much has changed in America . We have had two decades of rapid economic growth . Yet there is always a lowest third . Who belongs to the lower third today ? Where do they live ? What do they live on ? How great is the likelihood that they , like many of their predecessors of the 1930 's , will soon move up the income scale ? Before making comparisons between 1958 and 1937 , several warnings must be thoughtfully read . There are the effects of inflation to consider : the family that had $500 in the latter thirties had about the same purchasing power as the family with $2,000 now . Because the only statistics we have give income per family , we must consider changes in the number of persons in the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here we find that the numbers have gone down and the ages have gone up in recent years . There is a third cautionary factor ? population growth . In 1935-36 there were in this country 38.2 million families or unattached individuals who lived as consumer units ; but by 1957 there were 53.5 million , so that the same fraction of the populations of the two periods represents quite different numbers of people . Yet , keeping in mind these variations , it is possible to compare the least-privileged " third of the nation " then and now . Let 's first take the population as a whole . A comparison of total income in the two periods presents a striking contrast . A generation ago , among the consuming units in the country , the income most commonly received was less than $1,000 , and more than 75 percent of all units had incomes under $2,000 . By the dose of World War H , only about 30 percent of all units received less than $2,000 a year ; by 1947 , the most commonly received income was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached $4,500-$5,000 . The time is close when a third of the nation will be in the group whose incomes are $5,000 or better . In 1935-36 , if one charted the distribution of income , it looked like a broad-based pyramid ; today , it has the outlines of a Christmas tree . Table I ( page 14 ) shows the trend . This superficially dazzling improvement loses some of its brilliance , however , when the effect of intervening inflation on the price level is taken into account , and when recently increased dollar incomes are reduced to their real purchasing power as compared to that of 1935-36 . Even if only the postwar period is included , the reduction is sharp . On the surface , the fact that the number of families who did not have more than $2,000 dropped by more than a million between 1948-1954 looks promising . But the consumer price level went up 12 percent in this same interval . Thus , if 1954 incomes are deflated to show their purchasing power in 1948 dollars , it appears that the number of families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1954 as in 1948-9.6 million in ' 48 and 9.4 million in ' 54 ? and the number of unattached individuals in the low bracket actually rose by more than half a million in the interval . In the chart on page 15 , we can see how the distribution curve of family income has swayed upward over the decade . But , the big boom took place in the upper incomes . On the lower rungs of the ladder , considerable numbers of people were clearly unable to keep up with their climbing fellow-citizens . And so we find that , despite the rave notices given to the recent performance of the American economy , 14 percent of consumer units in 1957 still had incomes under $2,000 . Who are these people , and why did they get left behind ? Not one , but several reasons have kept families tied to the lowest rungs of the income ladder , or have caused families with previously higher standards of living to slip down . ? There are , first of all , the farm operator families living on farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce an adequate income from agriculture by modern technology . In 1954 , more than half the farms of the nation sold less than 10 percent of the farm products marketed . Almost half a million farms , operated by men who made it their main occupation , sold their products for from $250 to $1,199 , with production costs to be paid out of these totals . The location of many of these farm families brings to mind FDR 's designation of the South as the Nation 's Economic Problem Number One . By 1954 , Southern income had gone a long way toward catching up with the national average-in 1927-29 the per capita income of the Southeast was only 52 percent of the national average while by 1953-55 it had reached 69 percent-but a difference still remains . 4Second , the lowest one-third of the nation includes many elderly couples , or elderly individuals living alone : those too old to work who live on pensions , social security , or public assistance at a standard continually depressed by inflation . In 1954 nearly one-third of the families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and 46 percent of the unrelated individuals were over 65 , as compared with only 10 percent of the families with incomes of $3,000 or more . The effect of retirement is visible when we see that less than half of the units in the lowest income fifth of the population received any wages and salaries , as compared with 80 percent in the other income groups . Of the 8.5 million substandard urban units in 1950 , 2.5 million were single women . 4Next , today 's " one-third of a nation " includes those in broken homes , lacking a normal breadwinner . About an eighth of low-income families in 1954 were headed by women between 21 and 64 years of age , many of whom could not go into the labor market because of family responsibilities or ill-health . Of families with incomes under $1,000 , 44 percent were headed by persons not in the labor force , as were 37 percent of the families in the $1,000-2,000 range ; this contrasts with only 8 percent of the families with incomes above $3,000. 4Also , the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or could n't take , educational opportunity . In the 2.5 million families-one in three of those with incomes under $2,000-whose head worked at a nonfarm job , 41 percent of the breadwinners worked as operatives ( semi-skilled factory workers ) or in service jobs ; the earnings of workers who had not gone beyond grade school were materially less than those who had attended high school . The disadvantage of age in the low-income group shows up again in the country 's over-all educational levels : among the heads of families in the 2534 year age bracket , some 13.5 percent had finished high school and 5.4 percent had gone to college , as compared to 3.3 percent with high school and 1.2 percent with college training among heads of families who were 65 or over . 4Then there are the racially disadvantaged groups . In 1950 , when about 9 percent of all urban households were non-white , 20 percent of the substandard households were non-white. ' - Finally , the least-privileged of 1957 include many who are not well . Estimates of the physically and mentally handicapped suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity to earn ; of these , some 2.9 million are aged 14-64 ; some 2.2 million are 65 and over . If these , then , are the main components of the low-income group , how good are the chances of today 's lowest third to improve their position and share more fully in the national prosperity ? My guess is that their chances are less good than were the chances of their predecessors - even though economic opportunity in the depression years was far more limited in proportion to available skills than it is today ; a generation ago , the elderly group in the population was smaller . However , interest in the low-income group has recently taken on a new dimension , and more attention is likely to be given in the future to helping today 's low-income people to reach higher standards . Looking back , we see that in the years 1933-41 , from the New Deal to the Four Freedoms , the opportunity to achieve freedom from want was nailed down as the birthright of every American . The fight against poverty , whose amelioration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the driving force of a national effort . From WPA and PWA to social security and public assistance , the country spelled out its new national purpose . Then with passage of the Full Employment Act of 1946 , low earnings began to be viewed as deleterious not only to the individual , but to the collectivity of which he is a part . The disadvantaged person began to be regarded as a disadvantage to the state . This fairly new attitude toward the lowest third of the nation is seen , for example , in the progress report of the Interdepartmental Committee on the Problem of Low Incomes of New York State , appointed two years ago by Governor Averell Harriman . " The continued existence , " says the report , of families and individuals with inadequate incomes during the periods when the standard of living of most families has been rising is one of the major challenges facing our American society . Families with chronically low incomes are not full participants in our economic life . They contribute little as producers , and as consumers their purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improve the ability of such individuals and families to obtain higher levels of earnings and to make a larger contribution to society will be more than returned over a period of time . Raising the economic levels of these lowest economic groups thus benefits not only the families and individuals concerned but the entire economy . Today we can not afford to limit our efforts to achieve maximum utilization of all our human resources . From a statewide household survey conducted in New York last year , this Committee has obtained up-to-the-minute data on low incomes in a state whose upstate areas include substandard farm land and declining industrial centers , and whose metropolitan congestion produces some of the worst urban squalor in America ? white , Negro and Puerto Rican . The Committee says that between 1949 and 1956 , the number of low-income families went down about a third , and the public assistance rate declined 20 percent . Between the years 1950 and 1956 , the average number of years of schooling completed by persons 25 years of age and older rose from 9.6 to 10.7 ; 69 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school as compared with 57 percent six years earlier . ( The relation of education to earning power is emphasized by the study 's finding that only 25 percent of the men in the lowest-paid labor and service occupations had finished high school , as compared with 75 percent of those in managerial and professional occupations . ) But the Committee had been charged by Governor Harriman not only with responsibility for collecting facts on the underprivileged of New York , but with proposing programs to speed the transition of the lowest-income class upward . It recommended : 1 . Training for the more than 200,000 children in families receiving public assistance to help them break the cycle of low income , and for the children of farm families in marginal areas so that they might be able to fit themselves for non-farm employment . 2 . Child guidance clinics and special vocational edu cation for children for whom current educational offerings are unsuitable , and aid for children who now drop out of school for economic reasons . 3 . Rehabilitation to enable handicapped persons and recipients of workmen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable older persons to undertake a greater degree of self-care. 4 . Guidance for disturbed families . 5 . Programs to diminish discrimination in employment of minority groups . Cooperative pilot projects with joint participation by all concerned state agencies are now under way in each of these five areas . Their justification , from the standpoint of the whole community , can be found in the Committee 's statement on the 4,500 persons rehabilitated in New York in the fiscal year 1956-57 . Fifteen percent of them had been receiving public assistance to a total of $827,500 a year . Before rehabilitation , the group 's earnings were about $2 million ; afterwards , they earned $113/4 million . In terms of income tax alone , the return to the government over the remainder of their working lives is estimated to be $10 for every $1 spent on rehabilitating them . But the findings of the recent studies just reviewed belie the assumption that no one is really poor any more . In addition , this is a period when economic and social interdependence on a cash basis has crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucket has been replaced by a water meter on which monthly bills are rendered , when the old wood stove is no longer fueled from the woodlot which has become a subdivision , when living on products-in-kind has been replaced for hundreds of thousands of people by living on products-for-cash . The existence of hundreds of thousands of poor people ? ill-housed , ill-clothed , ill-fed in today 's surroundings of greatly increased national prosperity ? is no less of a public issue , no less of a weakness in the American system because the upward movement of other incomes obscures the conditions in which they live .
