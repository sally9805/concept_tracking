WHERE there was only an unfinished attic a year ago , we now have three bedrooms and space for a bathroom . By doing the work ourselves , my husband and I saved nearly $1,500 , had a lot of fun , and learned plenty . This account of some of the things we discovered may help other couples who need more space . We realize better now than we did at the start that we were fortunate in having an architect 's help . When we finished the subflooring , for example , we did not have to stop and figure out what to do next ? we simply turned to his plans and plunged on . By then , we had learned the terminology of house construction : rafters are the slant- ing beams that support the roof , studs are vertical members supporting the partition walls , the horizontal pieces they stand on are sole plates , and the horizontal ones that are used to tie the studs together at the top are top plates . Collar beams are the horizontal members tying opposite rafters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof , sometimes farther down . Ours were barely head high , and this brought us up against the case of the missing collar beams . More were needed . When our house was put up , ten years ago , the builder had adequately braced the roof with collar beams tying together every other pair of rafters . But they were too far apart to support insulation and the wallboard ceiling properly . So we had to install the missing collar beams . For these , we used two-by-fours , which did not have to be cut precisely , because we nailed them against the sides , or faces , of the rafters . In the center and south rooms we lined the beams up by temporarily nailing lengths of wood across the existing  | beams and setting the new beam on these strips . In the north room the existing collar beams were only six feet from the floor . The architect , who is 6 ' 3 " , recommended raising them to 6 ' 6 " , but we are shorter folk and felt we could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new beams right on top of the old ones and nailed them to the rafters . This placed the new beams higher by the width of a two-by-four , or at a height of 6 ' 3% " from the floor . Then we removed the old beams and nailed them up between the new ones , using a temporary batten to line them up , as we had in the other rooms . We learn about nailing . Since we were going to use a lot of two-by-four lumber , we persuaded our dealer to give us the quantity discount even though we ordered only two or three hundred feet at a time . We used well over a thousand feet before we finished the job . At first we ordered 14 ' lengths , but later we found we wasted less by using 8 ' pieces . We used sixteen-penny nails for collar beams and sole plates , and tenpenny nails for all other framing . As an aid in proper nailing we recommend a pamphlet , " Techniques of House Nailing , " published by the Housing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Superintendent of Documents , Government Printing Office , Washington 25 , ' D. C. , for 15 cents . It not only tells what size nails to use , but how many and where to drive them . The secret of driving nails right is to get yourself in position to hit the nail squarely with a full hammer swing , even if this takes some preliminary gymnastics . We stood on planks placed across our sawhorses . Although these had to be moved a good deal . it was worth the trouble . The sawhorses and planks were all we needed . To this day we do n't own a stepladder . Blueprint on the floor . Once the collar beams were in , we were ready to transfer our architect 's plan to the floor boards . First we dropped a plumb line from the ridgepole at several points to find the center line of the house . With this marked on the floor , we measured from it according to the blueprint . This gave us the outline of the east and west walls . North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the house and the chimney at the middle . Next we placed the sole plates ( two-byfours ) on the lines we had drawn , and  | fastened them with sixteen-penny nails through the subfloor into the joists , whose location was already marked by the flooring nails . The sole plates were interrupted wherever the plan called for a door . Thus , when the plates were clown , we had an outline in two-by-fours of the rooms to come . The sole plates had to be measured carefully and cut square to make doorways the proper width , corners abut solidly . and doorway studs fit accurately . A friendly carpenter showed us how to saw square and true . Draw the line carefully , he said , and then look clown on it directly over the saw . By keeping both eyes open you will seem to see the line on each side of the saw , and can easily cut " between " what you see . We aligned the top plate for the center walls ( the only ones that did not run up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collar beams to the sole plate . To hold the top plate in place for nailing to the collar beams , we cut the two end studs of each wall and set them under it . Each of these and the intervening studs was cut individually to fit the spot where it went . This was necessary because even a slight difference in length caused trouble . If studs were too short they would n't stay in place while we nailed them ; if too long , they bowed and did not present a square face for the wallboard . In fastening studs to the top plate we learned about toenailing . It took practice to get the hang of driving a nail diagonally through an upright into a horizontal member . The hammer blows tend to shift the upright out of position , and at first one of us held while the other nailed . But this seemed inefficient , so we drove nails temporarily into the plates to hold the studs in place . In toenailing as in straight nailing , it is important to smack the nail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The most important ? and expensive ? lesson we learned in this part of our attic project was that studs must be 16 " on centers ( as measured from center to center ) . You ca n't get by with 15 " or 17 " , because insulation and walboard are designed for standard 16 " spacing . Our builder had not been overly careful about this , and neither were we at first . It cost us dearly both in time and money . We can testify now that it 's even worth the price of extra two-by-fours for double studs to maintain that vital 16 " spacing . A less serious error that we made was to forget nailing strips around the dormer and at the rafter ends . You ca n't nail wallboard to empty air , or to a member an inch away . A stud at the outer corner does you no good when you want to nail board on the inside of the wall . We remembered to build out the inside corners of the rooms as shown in the drawing , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was far too light . By the time we got around to installing the wallboard , we learned to use two-by-fours . But it was much harder to set them in after the insulation and part of the walls were up . With the end studs already in place for the center walls , we ran a string taut between them to line up ' the other studs , setting them squarely on the sole plate . We checked with a level to make sure the studs were vertical . For the walls that ran right up to the rafters , we first set the end studs on the sole plate and used the level to find  | the right point on the rafters at which to nail them . Double studs and a double header ( the horizontal crosspiece on top ) in each doorway are standard practice . The inside member of the double stud goes down to the subfloor and is nailed to the end of the sole plate , at the top it 's cut short to fit under the header . The second stud , outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs up past the header to the top plate or rafter . Ceiling grilles were installed in each room , and a trap door in the south room . Through this we can install and service an attic fan . For grilles we used hot-air registers , which can be closed in winter by turning a small wheel . The trap , which is 32 " ( the space between two rafters ) by 24 " , is made of two layers of plywood with rock-wool insulation between . It is hinged on the south wall and held up by a catch . Insulation cane next . While the wiring was being installed ? a center light and two wall double outlets in each room , plus lights in the closets and a two-way switch circuit for the stairway light ? we considered various types of insulation . We finally chose one made of three layers of aluminum foil , two light and one heavy , held together by a honeycomb of fire-resistant paper . It is small in bulk and relatively easy to install , The 1,600 sq . ft. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one containing a mere 80 sq . ft. of rock-wool bats . To put up our insulation , we unfolded one end of a 250 ' strip and , using a stapling gun rented from the dealer , attached one paper flap to the side of a rafter from the eaves to the collar beam , across the collar beam , and down the far eaves . Then we unfolded the strip all along its length , opening up the honeycomb so that it spanned the distance to the next rafter . Pulling it taut , we stapled it to the inside of this rafter , leaving an airtight sheet of aluminum foil facing the room , with a honeycomb of air spaces and two other reflective layers of foil above it . We forgot some of the instructions the salesman gave us , and the manufacturer 's instruction slip was in the bottom of the box . So , of course , we put in a few hundred feet backward before we realized our error . But we were assured that it would n't reduce insulation efficiency enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point , uneven spacing of rafters became bothersome . Wherever they were more than 16 " apart , we had to run the insulation across instead of along the rafters , overlapping the short sections 4 " at every joint . This method of installation cost us  | 25 percent more in material , and of course a lot of extra trouble . The 4 " overlap was necessary , however , around obstructions such as the ceiling grilles . Rooms lake shape . To finish the walls and ceiling , we chose plasterboard . Although it is harder to work with than some boards , it was the cheapest one available . Measuring the areas carefully , we tried to order lengths that would work out to best advantage with the least waste . We stored the plasterboard in our garage on blocks , moving sheets upstairs only as we used them . For the first time we were forced to call on friends and neighbors for help , as I could n't carry my end of the 4 ' by 8 ' lengths . One of these neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work and considerable money . Since the space behind the side walls was to be for closets and storage , the eaves would n't show . Nevertheless , we wanted to cover them to protect the aluminum insulation . Our friend suggested that corrugated cardboard from cartons , stapled to the rafters , would be adequate for this . We were able to cover nearly a third of the attic with such cardboard , saving just that much wallboard . Despite the careful measurements we had made before ordering wallboard , we had a lot of waste because our studs were n't on 16 " centers . Sometimes three studs spanned 34 " instead of 32 " , making us scrap as much as 14 " of a board 4 ' wide . Professionals lay plasterboard flat on sawhorses for cutting , but we preferred to stand it against a wall . Measuring the area to be covered , we marked off the board and scribed the lines with a chisel . ( We had to buy a new chisel later , for this wrecked the edge . The experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the scribed line , and we then cut through the backing paper with a knife . To lay out the angular cuts where the boards had to fit under the eaves , we measured the height from the floor at two points the width of the piece apart , marked them on the board , and drew a straight line between them . The necessary openings for electric switches , outlets , and fixtures were roughly located on the hoard and a small hole punched for each . Then , with the board loosely in place , we inserted a keyhole saw and cut around the box . Our dealer sold us Pi " galvanized shingle nails to hold the plasterboard in place . We spaced these 8 " apart on vertical surfaces , 6 " apart on ceiling and eaves areas . These overhead surfaces were the back-breaking part of the job . To get the plasterboard in position on the sloping ceilings , we nailed a batten across the ends of the collar beams and another at the top of the wall studs . A third batten was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ' " blocks . The board was then inserted between this third batten and the rafters , and moved about against the others until it was square . For boards that went directly overhead , a single batten nailed over spacing blocks proved adequate . Where we had to fit plasterboard around the ceiling grilles , we found it much quicker to cut two or three pieces , each fitting part way around , than to cut one piece to an exact fit . Along the edges of the wallboard , nails were driven in the shallow recess provided . The proper technique here is to hit nails enough to sink them a bit below the surface , but not so hard as to break the board . We had some broken edges and corners , but consoled ourselves with the thought that molding and patching plaster would conceal or repair them .  |
