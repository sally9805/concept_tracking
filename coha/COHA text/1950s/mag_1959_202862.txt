The layman who know ? s nothing about art but suspects that abstract painters are off their rockers won support last week from a Paris physician who has treated about 70 abstractionists in the last ten years . Not only are they sick , said Dr. Elie Bontzolakis in the weekly Arts , but " the more abstract , the sicker they are . " <P> No psychiatrist but a general practitioner , Crete-born Dr. Bontzolakis. 51 , divides abstractionists into two classes . By far the larger : the poseurs , attracted by snob appeal , laziness , money or mere lack of talent . These , he finds , are rarely neurotic . But about one-third of his patients are passionately sincere , and they have both emotional and physical symptoms . <P> Blood-Pressure Gauge . Most obvious , says Dr. Bontzolakis , is anxiety accompanied by nervous tension . This may range from irrational fear , when confronted with something as objective as a photograph , to chronic delirium or schizophrenia . Then he often finds local itching which he attributes to allergic reactions with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Bontzolakis ' patients , the higher the blood pressure , the greater the tendency to abstractionism . <P> Among several case histories , Dr. Bontzolakis described a man of 57 who complained of dizziness , headaches and leg cramps . He had an enlarged heart with irregular beat , blood pressure of 250/130 . Within six weeks , on reserpine , he improved ( no headaches , less dizziness ) and gave up abstractionism for expressionism . The doctor pushed the treatment : the heartbeat became regular , blood pressure dropped to 160/100 , and the leg pain got better . The patient switched again-to primitivism . Dr. Bontzolakis was delighted . But two years later the man returned in worse shape than before , with blood pressure up again . What had happened ? He had backslid through expressionism to abstractions , had quit his medicine , and was painting wilder canvases than ever . <P> Backs to the Wall . Many abstractionists go to Dr. Bontzolakis. not only because they are a franc a dozen in Paris but also because his wife paints ( as Colette Bonzo ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame Bontzolakis ' work is strictly representational-flowery examples hang in her husband 's office . <P> Dr. Bontzolakis is not alone in equating abstractionism with emotional disturbance . Arts quoted another Paris doctor : " In abstract art , the process of creation is ... the famous Rorschach test reversed . " Said another : " Abstract art translates a disturbance which is perhaps only the anguish of these painters backed against the wall . " <P> Dr. Bontzolakis makes no exception for greatness . Picasso , he says , " is obviously an arteriosclerotic afflicted with hypertension , " and has recently shown " the same aggressiveness as the abstractionists show when they attack a canvas .
