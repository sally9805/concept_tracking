For the second time in its 108 steady years , the New York Times this week made public its annual report . The figures for 1958 confirmed the point made by the report for 1957 ( TIME , May 5 ) , i.e. , that the Times is willing to make only a thin profit in the interest of producing a news-thick paper . On gross newspaper revenue of $85,576,162 in 1958 , the Times netted $166,052-less than one-fifth of 1% . For the handful of public stockholders ( some 200 ) , the picture was not quite as grey as that figure indicated . The Spruce Falls Power &; Paper Co . Ltd. , in which the Times holds a 42% interest , turned a tidy profit of $1,119,307 . Preferred shareholders earned an 8% return on their investment-1% better than in 1957-and the Times chalked up its 61st consecutive year in the black .
