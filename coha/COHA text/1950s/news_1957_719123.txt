txt The case of the J. Radley Metzger Co. , Inc. , and Local 485 of the International Union of Electrical Workers is important in labor-management relations , for it raises the issue of " sweetheart contracts " and how to get rid of them . In an injunction action before Supreme Court Justice William C. Hecht Jr. , Local 485 claimed the company made contracts with Local 229 of the United Textile Workers which in the last five and one-half years have not gained the company 's employes a cent in wages , that Local 229 never did represent the employes , that it is " controlled and dominated by corruption and racketeering and was brought into the plant at the company 's request . " All but one of the employes of the company , Puerto Ricans , are now said to be members of 485 . They have been picketing the plant in support of " clean unionism , " as their placards declare . They want to dislodge 229 and get the employer to make a legitimate contract with 485 . The company asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisting that under the Taft-Hartley Law the contract with 229 bars intervention by 485 . This was granted on a temporary basis yesterday . Should 485 's claims finally be established , they would disclose a typical sweetheart contract case . Anyway , the facts as given serve to illustrate what such contracts are and how they may be voided . There is nothing in the Federal labor laws or in the rulings of the National Labor Relations Board that " bars intervention " of a legitimate union in such a situation . Quite the opposite : the TaftHartley Law offers one way to attack the sweetheart contract evil . The law authorizes the N. L. R. B. to set aside any contract that ( 1 ) was made by a union that did not represent an uncoerced majority of ' the employes or ( 2 ) involves domination by the employer . It will then authorize the employer to cease recognizing the union and giving effect to the contract ? no matter when it was negotiated . This . would leave the way open for a legitimate union to negotiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation any individual or group can file an " unfair labor practice charge " with a regional office of the N. L. R. B. which the office is obliged to investigate . If the charges seem well founded and no settlement can be reached a formal " complaint " is issued and a public hearing is held in the city where the case arose . The trial examiner who hears the case makes a full report with recommendations to the board , on the basis of which the board makes its final decision . Board orders , however , are reviewable by the courts . This may seem to would-be complainants a tortuous way to get action . But board records show that last year no less than 89 per cent of the unfair labor practice charges were closed out by the regional offices without a public hearing or recourse to the board . Those who negotiate sweetheart contracts have every reason to fear the exposure involved in public hearings and to drop the agreements when they are detected by the regional staff . Incidentally , only 2.8 per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those who want to do away with sweetheart contracts would do well to get the help of the N. L. R. B. , and the board should do everything to handle their , complaints with the greatest possible speed .
