Eighteenth Century Venice was gay , decadent and lip-service pious . Its sophisticated proverb : " In the morning a bit of Mass , in the afternoon a little game , in the evening a woman . " Its most famous son : the amorous mountebank Casanova . Its most accomplished artist : industrious Giambattista Tiepolo , who painted exactly to his townsmen 's taste . <P> In proud retrospect this week , Venice is giving Tiepolo his due in the biggest roundup of Tiepolos in history : 112 canvases , 150 drawings and engravings , gathered from museums , churches and private collections from Helsinki to Kansas City . In addition , special " Tiepolo Tours " cart art lovers through Venetian palazzi , churches and nearby villas to see the painter 's magnificent frescoes , full of spiraling angels , cherubs and pretty ladies . <P> Clogged Lagoons . The golden heyday of Venetian painting ( Bellini , Titian , Tintoretto ) was long past when Tiepolo was born in 1696 . The Republic of Venice , its trade failing , its lagoons clogging with silt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiepolo , like the Venetian aristocracy , took the riches accumulated by the Renaissance , blew them on one last spectacular display . <P> He began his own talented display in his teens , at 26 was considered accomplished enough to decorate the walls of the palace of the reigning Doge Cornaro . Soon he had so many commissions for his theatrical representations of the Scriptures and his fancy-dress treatments of mythology that he could not keep up . <P> Gravity Defied . As his fame spread , he got offers from abroad . In 1736 , the Swedish Ambassador to Venice invited him to travel to Stockholm to decorate the royal palace , wrote home to King Frederick I : " He is full of spirit , very accommodating , and a painter of infinite fire . . . " But Stockholm did n't promise a big enough commission ; Tiepolo decided not to accommodate . He scattered his sprawling frescoes and altar pieces across northern Italy and Germany , brightened palace ceilings from Milan to Wrzburg with gravity-defying gods and goddesses posed dramatically on luminous , pink-edged clouds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he covered more feet of canvas and wall than any other first-rate painter of his day . <P> <P> At 66 , Tiepolo made his last long European journey ; he took his two painter-sons , Giandomenico and Lorenzo , and traveled to Madrid . There , on the vaulted ceilings of Carlos Ill 's royal palace , he painted his last great works , glorifying the Spanish monarchy . But the peak of his popularity had passed . The baroque style which he had exploited to its limits had gone out of fashion . When he died in Madrid in 1770 , at 74 , his last canvases , altar screens painted for the San Pasquale convent in Aranjuez , were carted off to the basement . It was more than 150 years before the last of them was brought back upstairs , hung in a place of honor in Madrid 's Prado .
