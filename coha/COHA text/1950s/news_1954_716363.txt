txt Ch ? of of the Caris News Bureau of The Christian Science Monitor unity already is being felt , despite the fact that the present situation for these Vietnamese nationalists could hardly look less promising , in view of Mr. Ho 's military power , the Geneva conference , and M. MendesFrance 's three-week deadline for getting a cease fire . These Vietnamese have contended over the past eight years that they could rally support if France would only give them genuine independence . Now that they have produced a proof of their contention the blame for failure falls squarely on the French ' Governments ' delaying tactics over that period . In face . of this , to get peace by breaking up Indochina and handing over a major piece to the Communist-led Vietminh would put France in a most undesirable light . Neutrality ' Trap Seen Mr. Diem has returned to Sal . gon , Vietnam , to find full con. firmation of this attitude among the Vietnamese nationalists in that city . An important element of this new anti-Communist group feel that the negotiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neutrality , " are really a trap because the Vietnamese nationalist armies have not yet attained sufficient strength to " neutralize " those of the Vietminh  --  and that this is the only " neutrality " which can be realistically discussed at this time . In the camp of the Paris " realists " ? which shows that what is real in ? Paris is not real in Saigon ? it is pointed out that the only hope is a division and that if France breaks up Vietnam it is only breaking up something which it put together itself . Falling back on history in this way , however , is more or , less considered a bit of sophistry . Experts recall , however , that Tonkin , Annam , and Cochin China were all part of the Annamese Empire , which France assimilated piece by piece . Even after 66 years under the French , Vietnam is still a real unity and is likely to suffer like any other national unity if it is broken up .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
