A field under tillage . A tree . Woman breaking the soil with a hoe . Little girl nursing a baby . At one corner a stick planted in the ground . The woman works rhythmically to the lullaby she is singing . After a few moments the baby cries , and the girl puts it on her back , rocks it to and fro , joining in the lullaby . MOTHER Get you gone ! What is wrong with that one ? GIRL It cries . MOTHER What is your work ! GIRL To look after the baby . MOTHER Why ca n't you keep it quiet , then ? GIRL It does not want to . How long have I been trying ! MOTHER Long ? What is wrong with you . . . with it ! GIRL It is hungry . MOTHER Get you gone ! So quickly , so early ? GIRL It is already old day . It ought to cry .

GIRL ( Running to examine the shadow cast by the stick . ) Look , mother , it is true it is late . The shadow has grown tall , tall to the fourth line . p. 3 MOTHER What do you say ! Can it be true . . . so early ! GIRL Must truth wait for time ? Truth is truth early or late . MOTHER You speak better than you know . Truth is a timeless bird that comes and goes when it pleases . But I speak of the shadow of time . Are you sure the shadow has reached the fourth line ? GIRL I say not so . It is the rush of the sun makes it so . MOTHER Wo ! So I fool with you , my children . You are right . ' T is already ripe day . How short is a long period of time , but how long the waiting and the suffering ! Bring it to me , my girl . ( The woman sits down and feeds and fondles the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) MOTHER Come to mother ! Ah ! my big man ! Peace , peace , my lord ! There , there , feed . Tokozile wo n't even wipe away your tears . To her you are a mere burden , a burden that is worse because it lives and speaks . How greedy you are ! You will suck me dry ! Do you feed through your feet ? If not , kick not . Ah ! one day battle will snatch you away from me , from my breast of love and protection ! Oh , grow not old my child ! Be mine forever . Grow not old for wars and maidens , sorrows and intrigues lurk in the path . Grow not old , my boy , grow not old ! Or must I have you deformed to save you from the deformities of life ? Ah ! grow not old ! p. 4 GIRL Look ! The girls from ilima ! They are of our village . MOTHER They must have finished early .

Or is it because of them or for them they fight ? MAIDEN Let us break a sod for mother before we pass on . REST Ya . ( They work , swaying and singing . ) MOTHER You finished early . How was the feasting ? ONE We feasted almost to re-shaping our figures ! Never will they lack helpers if they treat us so well . We neither toiled nor tired . Work smashed against us and vanished ! MOTHER True . It is not you who speak but your physique . ( Two girls stop and dance for a moment , and the others laugh . They all go out. ) p. 5 MOTHER Thank you .

Let me belch and take breath . p. 6 MOTHER Where from , where to , and of what district ? WARRIOR A messenger has no name nor place . He is impersonal , and is not responsible for his words and actions . Is the country not dead ! Do n't you know ? I go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the battle ? WARRIOR Yes . The subjects of the King have perished . The two princes , Cetshwayo and Mbuyazi ( they call him Mbulalazwe ) have been fighting for the throne . Mbuyazi , the swift and beautiful , has been defeated and his men scattered . I hear he has been slain for he has disappeared mysteriously . Ah ! Ndondakusuka ! Ndondakusuka ! The umbilical cord of the Race is broken ! MOTHER Do you say so ! How did the battle go ? WARRIOR ( Rises ; recites emotionally , as if not addressing the woman . ) ' T was dawn the battle fierce began ! The sun above shone bright and fair , Rejoicing in its new-found day . Blue skies stood calm and bright and still ! Spectators of the fight of bulls !

From these came song , from those deep yell ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then came the flood like freshet fierce ! As swarms of locusts dim the sun , Clashing their shields , rushing to fight , The men robbed day of splendour bright ! For wave on wave the warriors came , And breast ' gainst breat the people fought , As shield ' pon shield the blows were hurled , And spear to spear made deathly speech ! One warrior falls and cries , I die ! They hear him not  --  he is now dust ! One trips before that surging wave , They heed him not  --  his day is done ! The rolling wave laps up his soul ! As eddying waters make retreat , From heroes great men drew back slain , And flower of youth drooped down all torn ! Whole sods of grass flew from the soil , And earth was shook and dust rose scared ! For yell on yell swept down the field , Accompanied by demon songs , The blaze of spears , the clash of arms , Till warriors felt unfeeling pain ! There fell the flower of Zulu blood , For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell the pick of Zulu flower To whom the battle grim was song ! Fell they or fought or groaned  --  they sang ! Till dead were mounds and blood shone streams , And youth looked aged and age grew mild . Then wrinkled braves on both sides cried , If thus ourselves today we slay , Who will our Star next day defend ? The cry came late ; the crime was done . . . Wide strewn the purple fragrant flower Of Mother Earth , all seared and torn ! The birds chirped loud , the rivers sang , The grass waned green , the wind wept soft , Blue skies stood deep with mystery ! p. 7 MOTHER It must have been a terrible spectacle ! So the land will be ruled by Cetshwayo ? WARRIOR It is no longer a question . But I fear he will want to ascend the throne before the old Elephant descends . He burns with ambition . MOTHER That would burn the old King with his own log . Afraid to do his duty and choose his successor , he sends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ! WARRIOR Give me more water . You speak more eloquently than you know . The land has perished ! The last link with our true Greatness and our Being is severed . The gourds are broken . We shall remain ourselves though ourselves no more . Mbuyazi , the last link with the Great Heavens , Shaka , has gone . MOTHER You speak a puzzle . I hear not . WARRIOR If you hear not , you are deaf . If you understand not , you are obtuse . MOTHER Make me wise , O messenger ! WARRIOR This is the kind of news reported to those who know it and kept a secret to those who know it not . MOTHER Au ! What kind of news is this that is made known where it is known and kept untold where it is unknown ! Is it witch news ? p. 8 WARRIOR It is news that can not slip out without breaking , and never break out without an explosion . MOTHER Well , we . . . who are we to speak and comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is the great places , the great things and the great ones who count and grow . We , the lowly , remain remaining .

The great come and go . How great , they come and go ! We , the common people , like the soil and pain , remain remaining , ever ourselves though never ourselves !

A dangerous Bull-calf , he . A thirsty Bull-calf , wild . We know . We fear . Bayede ! MPANDE You fear the Bull-calf , cowards ! You tremble and you shake like weaklings ! You forget that I , the old Bull , still can stab ! Then know that I , though old and full , can yet be wild ! My neck is strong . My horns are sharp ! COUNCIL Bayede ! Thou art heaven ! p. 10 MPANDE The Bull-calf has power , the old Bull wisdom . COUNCIL Bayede ! We hear . MPANDE I have a plan that will shield us from trouble . I am old and want peace .

I am the mouth of the Bull-calf . He comes ! He 's here ! VOICES The plan ! The plan ! He comes at an ill moment . We are not ready . What shall we do ? Let him be detained at the gate ! A VOICE Stop him who dares ! MASIPULA Silence ! You would panic like fowls before a hawk ! Leave it to us . We know what to do . And here he comes . ( Cetshwayo 's warriors are heard singing the song of the victory at Ndondakusuka , the music ending in a thunderous Bayede ! Uyizulu ! Enter Cetshwayo accompanied by Dabulamanzi and Mnyamana. ) p. 11 COUNCIL Bayede ! BARD Behold the mighty Bull-calf wild and strong ! Behold the beauty of great Might and Mind !

As for the Swazi hordes  --  they make me laugh ! Behold New Light now rises from the East ! Boer , English , Swazi , all will burn and melt ! From our Old Reed breaks forth a mighty Song ! All might from thy great Might absorbs its might ! Where Beauty feeds on Truth sprout Love and Song ! Behold the mighty Bull-calf wild and strong ! The strong are right , the right are strong . Give praise ! CETSHWAYO I have come . MPANDE My son , therefore , my lord , we hear you . You know why we are met here . CETSHWAYO I will not talk when that white Christian spy is here . MASIPULA He means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside . ) MISSIONARY I will go if I am not wanted . ( Aside . ) Woe to us if Cetshwayo ascends the throne ! p. 12 MASIPULA We think you act wisely .

DUNN ( Aside . ) Belittle as you will , my day comes soon . HAMU ( Aside to Zibhebhu . ) This Cetshwayo is boastful and vain . ZIBHEBHU ( Aside . ) He disgusts me ! He forgets that we , too , are of royal blood . MASIPULA Now that we have got rid of the missionary who was a hindrance to our progress , let us carry on . MPANDE The Bull-calf has heard . We wait on his word . CETSHWAYO I do n't want to be crowned King by that white goat ! Whence these customs ; whose are they ? Did not Ndondakusuka make me King ? Thrones are won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My time has passed . You are the lord of the land . It is your safety we would secure . Let Masipula speak . MASIPULA Bayede ! The Past speaks . Custom lives and rules . Our Ancestors move among us . And that means this : it is customary for a mighty dead king to rise up and anoint a brave young one . When a young king is so nominated and anointed , it is a blessing and a sign of coming success . The spirit of a dead king can assume any shape or form . It has been revealed to us that the spirit of the mighty Shaka lives and would anoint you , O dauntless one ! Strangely but truly , the spirit of Shaka has entered the soul of Somtsewu . It urges him on . It ties him with us . He can not help himself . He finds bewitched interest in us . He is ourselves . And we think this good for our military safety and purpose . p. 13 COUNCIL It is great news ! The Ancestors live and speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear . I shall rise and go and prepare . ( He and his two men rise and go out . ) MASIPULA I think the council understands ? VOICES We do . It is a wonderful and mystical thing . MASIPULA Look ! The Bull-calf left none too soon . VOICES Ah ! ' T is Somtsewu ! MASIPULA ' T is he . But for the Lion 's wisdom , he would be coming to death , swift and cold ! The Bull-calf was ready to eat him up with the assagai . MPANDE Do n't say was . I know him . He still thinks and wants to do the same . Only he fears the spirits . We must be cautious . Here comes Somtsewu . Remember he is the spirit of Shaka . ( Enter Shepstone . ) COUNCIL Bayede ! ( Shepstone is amazed but feels flattered and elated to receive the royal salute hitherto accorded no white person . ) SOMTSEWU Eh ! ( As he salutes the people and a place is arranged for him , Dunn speaks ) p. 14 DUNN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Government , Mpande and the old tribal order , Cetshwayo a new revolutionary force , the chiefs who favoured Mbuyazi nursing their wounds against Cetshwayo , the Boers waiting sphinx-like beyond Natal , the missionaries and Cetshwayo 's bloodthirsty generals and regiments ! Great God , there must be an explosion soon . . . and it must blow up poor Dunn to some mighty position ! It must ! They think I am a fool . But it takes a philosopher or a poet to do what I do and be what I am . SHEPSTONE ( Now seated ; discovering Dunn . ) Dunn ! I do n't like it ! To have other white men with different aims in this game of handling Natives complicates matters . In fact it is dangerous . MASIPULA The chief from Natal has come . You all know why he has come . COUNCIL We know . We rejoice . SHEPSTONE I bring you tidings of the defeated people of Mbuyazi . They want peace and friendship . Even the grand old woman , Monase , asked me to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her personal attendants in the past . I have sent one of my messengers to convey these greetings to them . But to you men , I speak myself . ( There is a murmur among the men , and certain signs of restlessness invisible to one not initiated in these things. ) p. 15 MASIPULA You have sent a servant to the maidens ! SHEPSTONE Yes , I have . Have I done what is not done ? MASIPULA But the girls you speak of are in the young king 's harem ! SHEPSTONE I hear that is where they are . MASIPULA And you sent your messenger there ? SHEPSTONE Have I done wrong ? Here he comes . We shall hear . AN INDUNA ( Aside . ) You 'll hear more than he says , more than is audible ! ( Enter Shepstone 's servant , a Christian man from Natal . ) SERVANT Great ones ! I give praise ! I am back , white father . SHEPSTONE Did you see and convey to the girls the message ? SERVANT Yes , I did . MASIPULA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SERVANT Yes , thou great one . MASIPULA By Jama ! I do not know what to make of it ! SHEPSTONE I see that something is wrong . MASIPULA Servant , why teachest thou not thy master ? Art thou foreign to our customs and traditions , or art thou a servile servant ? p. 16 VOICES Hear ye ! See ! The Bull-calf comes with his men ! ( Song of the warriors heard . ) SHEPSTONE Did I not ask Cetshwayo to come with not more than six of his men . Behold he comes with a battalion of fully armed warriors , singing ! MPANDE Leave it to us . Not for the first time do we see things like these . SHEPSTONE I 'm sure it is so . ( Aside . ) Mighty tumultuous currents rush below these calm waters . AN INDUNA ( Aside to another . ) Somtsewu is a fool to raise the deadly ghosts of Ndondakusuka and bleed the fresh wounds of Queen Monase 's affair . ( Song of the warriors ends . ) MASIPULA ( To Mpande and Shepstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He comes with his favourites , Mnyamana and Dabulamanzi .

SHEPSTONE Au ! You are quiet , thou Great One . I speak in peace . ( The people sway uneasily and murmur inaudibly . They see what Shepstone does not : that , sitting apparently relaxed and unmoved , Cetshwayo , mad with anger , is on his haunches , and is poised and ready to pounce upon Shepstone if he repeats the salutation for the third time . Swift as a snake rises and strikes , Mpande rises and intervenes . ) MPANDE Custom lives and rules . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancestral spirits . Who goes against sacrosanct tradition defiles and kills himself . Hear me . It is one of our sacred laws that an honoured visitor , let alone one representing a foreign king , be treated with respect , patience and indulgence . Like a royal messenger who even in the midst of hostilities can safely convey a message to the enemy 's camp , an honoured guest must not be ill-treated . Today as we stand before the ancestral spirits , we must not forget this . Welcome Somtsewu , you in whom the past lives . Welcome you who art not thyself , but your exalted position . Somtsewu , you have brought us peaceful greetings , and it is for me to accept and reciprocate them . This I now do . We know why you have come . We are ready . p. 18 COUNCIL Msimude !

MASIPULA These are mighty and weighty words the Lion has spoken . ( In drawing back to allow the prancing bard sufficient room , the people have exposed Somtsewu 's servant who hitherto has been out of sight . Mnyamana and Cetshwayo exchange glances and whispers , and nod towards the man . ) CETSHWAYO ( Aside to Mnyamana . ) If custom forbids action against the master , it does not protect this dog . ( Aloud . ) Mfokazana , what did you want in the harem ? VOICES Uuuuuummmm ! BARD ( Aside . ) The spirit of woman hovers over the place . SHEPSTONE He went there to convey the greetings of the aged Monase . MPANDE We know why we are here . Let us do our work . SHEPSTONE I wait on your advice to begin . CETSHWAYO Mfokazana , what did you want there ? Perhaps you do not hear me . ( Without rising , moves a step or two towards the messenger who is seated a little way from him . The man shows signs of helpless fear. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly . ) I thought I had explained . Are the greetings of the old not a blessing ? BARD ( Aside . ) The mind of woman exercises these men . CETSHWAYO You are quiet . Now I am sure you do not hear me ! ( Moves forward as before . Mpande and Masipula are seen consulting one another , and then the indunas near them . They do this calmly and almost imperceptibly . ) BARD ( Aside . ) The hand of woman impels these actions , and controls these issues . SHEPSTONE Au ! He went there not as a man but as a message . If wrong has been done , not he , but I am responsible . BARD Woman is ready to open the gates of chaos . A COUNCILLOR ( Aside . ) Somtsewu is a fool ! 2ND COUNCILLOR The first time he was saved by the Lion . Now nothing will save him . 3RD COUNCILLOR One move by the Bull-calf . . . and all is lost ! ( Suddenly there is a shout of A snake ! A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people rise in commotion . Masipula quickly raises his arm , and speaks at the top of his voice. ) p. 20 MASIPULA Peace ! Peace ! Be seated . ' T is the spirit ! Do not move and shout so . ' Twill be annoyed and offended . And it will not stay , bless and speak to us . Let it pass on beyond our midst into the royal Hut . It lives and speaks . When this happens where a Council is met , it is a warning , a sign , a message reminding us of our sacred customs and great tradition . Now that you have seen this miracle for yourselves , what more need I say . The spirits will strike dead who disobeys . BARD ( Aside . ) They have discovered the snake , and all will be well now . A COUNCILLOR ( Aside to another . ) Was it a real python ? Where and when has it disappeared ? 2ND COUNCILLOR ( Aside . ) It would seem a clever trick of Masipula 's . SHEPSTONE ( Grasping what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has into his words . ) It is a sign . And I must speak frankly . It is plain some of you want to kill me and shed blood . It would be useless to do so . It would destroy you yourselves . There beyond the waters of the boundless ocean the great white Queen has thousands upon thousands of soldiers . If you kill me they will avenge my death . I am not afraid of being killed  --  warriors live to be killed . I fear what will happen to you . Every wave of the ocean will lash forth a thousand men . Your armies , great and brave as they are , will be mowed down and perish with cannon fire and worse . Not so the soldiers of the Queen . Like waves these men roar and charge , fall back , press on , ever toil , never die , can never be exterminated . I have come in peace . Why do you think of arms ? I have come to perform a sacred duty . Why do you refuse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave , wise , old Lion , tell me what to do . I have time for no more words . I must return to Mgungundlovu and report . King on my own , I am yet servant to you , the King .

Will you not come forward and receive our united blessings , praises and pledges of loyalty . We stand ready to see you crowned . What more ? Lion of Beauty and Strength , come . Come , battle-scarred and wound-adorned hero . ( There is a deep pause . ) CETSHWAYO Proceed . I accept the crown . ( Wild burst of excitement , thanks and praises . ) MASIPULA Peace ! Peace !

A great coronation chair is placed at the centre , and tribal mats are spread out as a path to the throne . Masipula calls the assembly to order . Shepstone , holding a brass and feather crown , goes up and stands to the right of the chair . Mpande , taking the coronation robe ( a huge tiger skin ) moves and stands to the left of the chair .

( They go out helter-skelter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my efforts ripe For execution . Long toiled I , long served , Served where I should have reaped , should have been served ; The journey has been long , the going thorny . Now feel I like a wanderer long from home , Returning back , who stands on distances Where like a magic glimmer home he Discerns . He thinks and feels , remembers , weeps ! Anticipations sweet and memories Commingling with strange fears and stranger doubts ; For when near home , come doubts if home is home Of rich your dreams and memories . A point Where one behind him looks and ' fore , afraid , Fearing the promised joys unknown , gloating O'er perils , evils , frights of dark his past ; Where grim past trails future pleasures turn ; And one becomes the buffer and the centre Of what was in the past and what might be ; And for a fleeting moment time and motion Cease . And , transfixed and mute , himself no longer , Oblivious to the present , lone he stands , And lives but memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roofs Of homes of my pent-up ambitions ; homes That from these distances seem hardly homes ; Dim calling gleams that mark my journey 's end .

Things past that present seem ! My thoughts already tread the longed-for distant shores . There all my soul ! Only my clayey sod Is in this place , the outward man alone . Deceive me not Ambition bitter-sweet Into precipitate wild actions wrong ! For still have I blood rivers deep to ford , Dark valleys walk . Ambitions great have made The way look endless . . . short ! and painful . . . sweet ! How far have I not come , how far to go To attain the prize .

I wonder if Mr Shepstone and the Government know about his evil genius and equally evil game . ( Discovering himself . ) Good day , friend Dunn . DUNN Ah ! Business all right ? THE MAN Yes . I have a fair consignment of guns . The growing tension between the Zulus and the European , and between Dutch and British , has removed our few Boer competitors from the field . We are safe and free . DUNN It is just when and why we must be cautious . I see two Zulus coming . Listen . Meet me at the usual spot tomorrow evening . I will direct where we must sell the guns . Cetshwayo and his followers must be given nothing . To entice them and make them dance to my tune , I 'll sell Hamu and Zibhebhu a few . The rest we must sell to neutral Natives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gain power . Now go before they come . Say ! Give me those two samples you have . Thank you . Goodbye . ( The man goes out . Dunn hides the guns behind a small bush , steals glances this way and that , listens attentively , and then disappears behind the same bush . Enter Zibhebhu and Hamu . ) DUNN ( Peering cautiously ; to himself . ) O villain within me play your part saintly ! ( Disappears. ) p. 31 HAMU Why should Cetshwayo who is no better than ourselves reign over all Zululand ! ZIBHEBHU Over me he will not rule . HAMU He was blown big by the battle of Ndondakusuka . ZIBHEBHU ' T is he will be Mbuyazi this time . He will be cut off . HAMU I will never forgive Cetshwayo for having cut off our last link with the mighty Shaka . ZIBHEBHU We all hate him for that , and he will pay for it . The great Zulu river now divides . But after a long journey the same streams  --  bigger , richer and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean of unity and greatness . DUNN ( Discovering himself . ) Sanibona makhosi ! HAMU ' T is Jantoni ! ZIBHEBHU Eavesdropping ! DUNN No . . . . HAMU He denies . ZIBHEBHU What does the villain want here , then ? DUNN It is I who am surprised to see you here , you Higher Ones . I am the worm that must wander about blindly. p. 32 ZIBHEBHU And blindly seek our company ? And be crushed to death , blind ? DUNN I crave and beg for snuff only . I forget to inquire after your health , my lords . HAMU ( Giving snuff . ) All is well . We still toddle on . DUNN Thank you , Thou Higher One . But from what I observe you seem troubled by your thoughts . ZIBHEBHU Who are you to ask or say that to us ! HAMU Let him speak freely that we may know . ZIBHEBHU What is Jantoni , Cetshwayo 's retainer , after all ! Is he not our enemy 's servant , a servant of the servant of evil ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plans . ZIBHEBHU ( Aloud . ) What can this dog of a white man do ? Indeed , I feel like eating him up with the assagai ! ( Threatens to stab Dunn . Hamu intervenes . ) HAMU Let words , not arms , speak . . . our position and authority , and not our hands and wrath . ZIBHEBHU I hear you . But things like Jantoni were born not only to die but to be destroyed . p. 33 HAMU At birth every person already has marked indelibly on the brow the sign of death . DUNN Would you kill your ally ? ZIBHEBHU The leaking mouth of a deceiver ! HAMU Our confederate ! How and in what ? Allies are for those with ambitions and designs . We have none . We are allies to all , and know not the meaning of the word ally , therefore . DUNN I serve where I am not happy . Those whom I love I dare not serve . HAMU Who do you love ? ZIBHEBHU Himself , of course ! DUNN You , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . HAMU What magic would Jantoni speak ? DUNN The magic of my country , England . There , not one man , but many , reign . Each lord is master in his place . The king is king because of the real rulers . They hold power , and the king is but the symbol of the unity and the common interests and origin of the people . That is England . ZIBHEBHU ( Sarcastic . ) If England changes not her thoughts and systems , she shall perish ! HAMU Curb your wrath , brother . What is it you say , Jantoni ? I do not understand your words . Yours is a strange tongue . p. 34 ZIBHEBHU It is the double-tongued hiss of the snakes they are . Their language preludes a fatal bite . HAMU Fear him not , Jantoni . Let us hear more of your tale . DUNN You are the true rulers of the land . You have whole tribes and warriors under you . The King , of course , is King and must remain so . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be independent . Why do n't you do as they in England do ! ZIBHEBHU What has England to do with us ? What has England done for us ? HAMU Ask rather what England has done to us , and what she can still do . Let Jantoni speak to me alone for a while . ZIBHEBHU Let him speak for ages for all I care ! ( Hamu and Dunn stand aside and exchange excited whispers while Zibhebhu takes snuff , sneezes and sings and sways . After a while Hamu goes over and whispers to Zibhebhu . The two then go back to Dunn . ) HAMU No , we hear your words . You speak . We will chew them fine . DUNN If and when you agree I shall advise Somtsewu to divide the land into such kingdomlets , and each of you will be absolute master in his place . HAMU I hope we can rely on his words ? p. 35 ZIBHEBHU I rely on my assagai to kill the dog if he deceives us . HAMU That means we agree , white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you walk straight in the path because if you stagger or fall out of the way the blades of grass will cut you down . Remain in peace . DUNN Oh ! I forget . Will you not accept a small gift from me ? ( He goes and gets the two guns from behind the bush , and hands them over to the two . ) DUNN Here it is . They are not easily obtainable . I shall try and bring you a few more if you want them . But I can get only a few . HAMU One is tempted to rely on you completely . We appreciate the fine gift . Get us as many more as you can . Remain in peace . ( Hamu and Zibhebhu go out . ) DUNN As I expected the fools have fallen into the trap I 've set for them . Now it only remains to bamboozle Shepstone and the Government , and the path will be open to ascend the Zulu throne which I will use to throw out Shepstone himself , and be the master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not listen . I will not be deterred . What ! Shall I be ruled over by savages . . . I , with generations of civilisation behind me ? I only claim what is my just position , what are my rights and rewards . Under them , I can only be troublesome , unfaithful , dangerous , and plot against these savages . Above them , I can be their just ruler , wise leader , and their benevolent father . I am above though below them . Damn my sexual cravings ! I know I am lascivious and gloat over their women . But still am I better than these savages mentally , culturally and racially . Ah ! But how attractive these women are ! Raw and fresh , wild and exotic ! Go down , conscience , down ! What ? My ambition to overthrow Shepstone ? Nonsense ! There is nothing immoral and unusual in that . It is the western game and way of life . Are we not Europeans , playing our dirty , sweet , old game of gain , greed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cheat these poor savages who are blind and gullible , not to rob the European who himself stands to rob . Ah ! One of my race of deceivers and liberators , of ruthless conquerors and just administrators , of callous exploiters and Christian gentlemen ! ( Enter a farmer. ) p. 36 FARMER I am sorry , Dunn . But we farmers mean to destroy the power of your Zulu friends . They  --  or to be more correct , their savage customs and their military power and system  --  are a real menace . DUNN You are mistaken . I am no friend of theirs . Like traders , administrators , missionaries and farmers , I live on them , and have my own interests . FARMER What do you mean ? We farmers are friends to all . We are the true pioneers who bear the brunt of the opening up of this dark continent . It is you and your friends who live on the Natives . DUNN Then why all this bitterness ? If I am bad I am at least honest and frank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of political intriguers , interlopers , adventurers and treasure hunters . When Mr Shepstone helped the Zulus in their kingship tangle , it was said that this would protect and improve the position of the Europeans and weaken Zulu military power . But we find the Natives grow more menacing , more of a mortal danger . DUNN But they complain that it is the white man who interferes with them in their own country ; who tries to impose his laws , system and Christian ways on them ; who wants to take away their land from them , and asks them to own it by right of purchase , and having purchased it , live on it by accepting the Europeans ' laws and sovereignty . p. 37 FARMER Why should niggers own land ? What do they know about land purchase , boundaries , tillage and values ? We want more land , but can not get it owing to the hostile attitude of Cetshwayo and his hordes . DUNN But the Government gives to every European farmer-settler who so desires , a piece of six thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair and generous . But for the first seven years farmers can not transfer or alienate these farms without the Government 's consent . Why can not they let us do what we like with our farms ? DUNN I understand it is to establish , stabilise and protect you . FARMER Are we nitwits to be protected ? We want no protection save from the warlike tendencies of the Zulus . DUNN Do you want slices of land from the exclusively Native territory of Zululand ? FARMER Our great trouble is water . A farm of six thousand acres and no adequate supply of water is desert land . Well-watered lands are held by Cetshwayo and can only be got by smashing his power and military organisation . DUNN You are a closer friend than I thought you were ! We both agree that Cetshwayo is the source of trouble , and that he must be destroyed or dethroned. p. 38 FARMER I am surprised and glad to find we think alike . If the Government does not want us to leave its boundaries and go into the interior or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the Boers , something must be done at once . DUNN If you and the other farmers promise to exert your influence on the Government to destroy Cetshwayo , I shall help by undermining his power , and by promoting and encouraging disputes among the chiefs and indunas . Go and preach the revolutionary doctrine to the farmers . Let them farm discontent , hate and revolution ! FARMER It needs no preaching . It is gospel already . Goodbye . We shall need your help . DUNN I shall call on you , now and again , to report . Good luck ! ( The farmer goes out . As Dunn looks at him with obvious triumph , a missionary comes in . ) MISSIONARY ( Aside . ) Here is this disgraceful white man turned Native , a piece of barren home soil on foreign ground , a shameful specimen of white civilisation , humiliated Britain in Natal , defeated Europe in Africa ! I detest him ! We who have deep roots at home , perish and die on foreign soil , but those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in places strange  --  the foreign becoming the native , the native forgotten , despised and lost ; adapting themselves with zest to things new and incongruous , abandoning with nauseating ease and without show of sad feelings old sanctions , philosophies , habits and ties . I detest him ! But I must hold my tongue and curb my feelings  --  for in foreign lands and among foreign people even the worst and lowliest of your race becomes your very brother and companion , appeasing for the moment your race hunger , helping you to find , express , reflect and be yourself . How patriotic we become in foreign lands ! How then we appreciate the depth , meaning , beauty and distinctiveness of our race , customs and country . We become the representatives of the race . I detest him ! But I believe he has more talent than all of us including Mr Shepstone . But his is an evil genius . The filibuster ! ( Aloud . ) Good day , Mr Dunn . p. 39 DUNN ( Turning round . ) Ah ! Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Him also I can use to further my plans . GRANT May I speak to you as one European to another ? DUNN Of course . ( Aside . ) Insolent ! What does he think I am ? GRANT Can not you use your position , influence and wisdom to prevent the frequent mass killings and orgies of witchcraft in Zululand ? One of my converts has just reported that a warrior of Cetshwayo 's has killed a man right here a few minutes back . The body is hidden . . . yes , it must be over there according to his instructions . DUNN I am not surprised . A tyrant reigns in Zululand . GRANT I knew it the day he was appointed . You will remember the treatment he gave me . . . asking me to leave the assembly ? DUNN I know . It was disgraceful . GRANT You and I have come to stay here . We must do something about it if only to safeguard the interests and life of our children . The root of the trouble is Cetshwayo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on earth as great as he . He blasphemes against Almighty God , belittles His servants and persecutes the converts . p. 40 DUNN Destroy his power and you will easily win over the people to Christianity . Draw the Government 's attention to the atrocities and the danger . I have made my own complaints and reports to Mr Shepstone . Knowing Zululand as I do , and being on intimate terms with the people as I am , I can be of great assistance to the Government if they support my terms and conditions . I 've told Shepstone so . If you support me by getting the other missionaries to make a strong protest , our joint action will be effective . GRANT Thank you . I 'll do so . Now let me find the body of the murdered man . DUNN Take my advice , Sir . Go back and organise a deputation to Mr Shepstone . Do not entangle yourself into unnecessary troubles by interfering with the body . It is taboo . They might want it for witchcraft purposes , and if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deadly . Come , let me accompany you across while we discuss one or two details . ( They go out . After a moment , Bafikile comes in , carrying a bundle of wood . ) BAFIKILE O madness of unuttered thought ! O tumult of great aims unwrought ! ( She puts down the bundle and rubs ointment on her limbs . ) The eyes of the young king are upon me . His feet run stealthily behind my own . I should rejoice , yet I rejoice not , for he comes to me with his hands tied . Only his heart and tongue are free . Having chosen his chief wife he now finds me chief in his heart . Must custom stale love or love , custom ? To what issues will this pursuit give birth ? Whisper it to me , O ye spirits ! Pity the land is in travail and man is wedded to arms and divorced from love . ( Moves about gracefully as she anoints and decorates herself , singing softly and sadly all the time . She also ties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunn unobserved . He speaks as she sings softly ) p. 41 DUNN How soothingly her voice seeps down like showers into my protoplasmic stream of love ! She 's dark and soft as night ! The bright deep stars of her sad eyes call forth to me . Her voice is melody itself ! Ah ! Beauty black ! The ever moving coils of dun her body charm and mesmerise me as a snake a frog , and grip and squeeze and break me python-like ! Her lips are petals that flower forth in smiles ! The heaving ocean that her deep breast is , with longing tosses me in strong waves . Her paps . . . the two poles of my extreme desire ! Sweet sable maid my passions soothe  --  and fire ! For beauty found perfection in your form . ( Shame ! white man , go ! ) This beauty and this glory my feet have paralysed , my strength sucked soft ! My eyes keep stealing furtively the beauty that has  --  blind sight !  --  already stolen them ! ( Away , Dunn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if thou'rt lost . ' T would be to fall twice once ! ) How suggestively , invitingly she moves ! Charmed maid transform my colour with your touch ! Her curves cut deep into my soul . Her motions rock to my mouth my heart ! I yearn . I choke ! Desire infiltrates deep down my soul . See how her body with sweet ointment glows ; which melts away my powers of resistance . Her glossy skin reflects her beauty pure , mirrors my dark desires , blinds me to Reason 's call . All slippery , she ! And my unbalanced Self towards her slides ! O immoral landslide ! Help ! I fall into Destruction of Desire ! ( He coughs out , and Bafikile discovers him. ) p. 42 DUNN Good day , maiden . BAFIKILE ( Moving away from him in utter disgust ; aside . ) This dog ! DUNN Are you too tired to speak ? BAFIKILE ( Furious . ) For you even to address me shames and humiliates me . ( She gathers her things and prepares to take up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear a burden . Help me to carry it as lightly as you do yours . My burden is love . BAFIKILE Pig ! Beast ! I have heard of your depravities and wanton ways . Because the King has given you wives you think you can get wives yourself by making love , forgetting that even the women you have were forced by custom and fear of death to live with you . A foolish dog given a bone tries to steal its master 's most precious preserves . ( Her anger has only helped to increase Dunn 's cravings . As she tries to go away , he attempts to stop her by force . She throws down the bundle , and they wrestle fiercely . Enter two warriors . ) THEY What is it ? What omen , this ? BAFIKILE Flog the dog that would outrage me ! ONE Strange fish this with surging warm blood uncontrollable !

Enter Zwana , suddenly stops , and scans an invisible object as a python stalks its would-be victim . Steals behind a tree . Enter a Christian convert . Like a tiger Zwana pounces upon and strangles him without uttering a word . The struggle is not long , and the convert 's body turns flaccid . ZWANA ( Dragging the body into the forest . ) So you told , truthful Christian ! Well , go and tell your heavenly Father , too ! ( Disappears into the forest . A slight pause . Sound of woman 's voice singing soft and low . Enter Bafikile ; moves to and fro picking up pieces of dry wood . She sees a flower , stops singing , and as soon breaks into another song . ) BAFIKILE Green forest flower , so pure , so bright ! And shedding virgin sweetness ! Your strange charm whence , your colours gay ? Your beauty brings me sadness !

At last they roll the ball ! Grasshopper you keep hopping here , And touching everywhere ; Grasshopper  --  Ha !  --  keep hopping there . . . It takes you to nowhere ! ( As she ties the bundle , Cetshwayo enters , espies her , and hides behind a tree . She lifts and puts the bundle upon her head , tests its balance , and as she starts to move away , Cetshwayo springs out and stands in her way . Each time he says Qoma ! he jumps about playfully before her , wielding his sticks . In speaking to him she addresses Cetshwayo by a pet respect name , her own invention , as it is taboo to speak his real name. ) p. 45 CETSHWAYO Qoma ! BAFIKILE Iya ! CETSHWAYO Qoma ! BAFIKILE Have ! CETSHWAYO ( Ceasing to be playful . ) Bafikile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CETSHWAYO I 'm glad to do something remarkable enough to cause surprise . But why are you surprised ? BAFIKILE Is this not you ? CETSHWAYO No . I am my ghost . BAFIKILE You speak truth . You are but a shadow of what you should be . CETSHWAYO No . My ghost is not I. I am I. What then ? BAFIKILE Have you not been appointed ruler over the land ? CETSHWAYO A greater domain is my heart . However , if I have ? BAFIKILE How can you , the chosen , behave as you do ?

CETSHWAYO That is greatness . Now you listen to me . Put down that bundle . BAFIKILE I wo n't . I am sent . I am in haste . CETSHWAYO You said I am king . BAFIKILE What then ? CETSHWAYO Obey . BAFIKILE You said you were not . CETSHWAYO Did I ? BAFIKILE I wo n't obey kings that are no kings . p. 47 CETSHWAYO This way you will . ( He tickles her . She laughs and sulks and protests by turns , but lets down the bundle . Sound of lowing cattle . ) BAFIKILE Listen ! CETSHWAYO It is the cattle returning home , and the voices of the herdsmen brave .

BAFIKILE ( Emotional and grave . ) We grew up together , Tabane . CETSHWAYO We did . But you are child to me . BAFIKILE Ah ! Call no woman , child . Women are deep . CETSHWAYO So that strong men may swim over them  --  not sink into them like weaklings . BAFIKILE I know things you do not know . Am I not the daughter of Ngcobo , the great seer-herbalist ?

BAFIKILE There is something uncanny and tragic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity and danger . CETSHWAYO I knew . BAFIKILE The Spirits told that I shall be required to marry a mighty king , but warned that this must not be allowed to take place before the king washes his assagais by waging war . They threatened that if this happened , there would be disaster in the land . The Spirits advised that the king washes his spears in some distant place , for nearer home lies a seemingly harmless but treacherous pool where the king 's armies must not wash their spears . CETSHWAYO This is strange . What you say is known , but it has ripened into a dark puzzle . BAFIKILE It is the shedding of blood I fear . Let these things not come to pass if they can only be accomplished by shedding blood . Blood stains the radiance of peace and love . CETSHWAYO There is one thing I know . . .

CETSHWAYO I speak of love not marriage . I speak of love not wives and husbands . For there can be marriage , husbands and wives without love , truth or joy . But love is all . BAFIKILE All I know is that love without marriage is incomplete . CETSHWAYO You mean you love me ? BAFIKILE I do . But it will serve no good purpose . CETSHWAYO Your father is a seer of renown . Against his vision and warnings I will not venture . But you , Beloved , I must win . BAFIKILE Weary not yourself about me , nor fret . The land is flowery with daughters of Man . Shed no blood for my sake . CETSHWAYO You do not understand . It is custom for a new king to wash his spears in battle . But to me it is more than custom . Like great Shaka I will fight to unite all the races into one strong nation . That is my task . My life and reign must be judged on that basis . And that is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not understand these things . Zulu name and fame must be universal . Let me sing praises to my idea . Zulu Might and Name will rule all names !

By custom slow , of nature sound , We Present test , and Future sound . Deep , measureless , see how we lie . . . Our hidden Mind above the sky !

To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ; to a woman 's heart name and fame and life are love . ( Cetshwayo recovers from his trance-like meditation , and comes back to her . ) CETSHWAYO I was under a fit of aspiration and emotion . Such things will happen . Wonder not nor be worried . BAFIKILE I am worried about what you said the other day about settling matters with the Boers . I am afraid . CETSHWAYO Afraid of what ? BAFIKILE Of the English . CETSHWAYO The English or the Boers ? BAFIKILE Both . CETSHWAYO Thou art raging mad . Man 's business unsexes you . Be where you belong and all will be well . BAFIKILE The Boers or the English . . . that is not the question . The question is , the white people or we . CETSHWAYO This madness maddens me ! BAFIKILE Did you not say the English take interest in the matter ? CETSHWAYO They do . Are they not our neighbours . Neighbours like to neighbour neighbours . It is right . p. 51 BAFIKILE It is not . ' Twill be right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CETSHWAYO Women and their dreams ! The English are on our side . It is the Boers who stand in the way . And he who stands in the path asks for trouble . BAFIKILE Trust no white person . They do not want us . It is all pretence . And that is the source of our troubles  --  and our hope . CETSHWAYO Talking , you say nothing . Stop talking and speak . I grow impatient . BAFIKILE Wait . I come . CETSHWAYO Go straight to it , then . Do not wander about . BAFIKILE I can not come to a point before I proceed towards it . You want me to arrive before I travel . What I want to say is that there is danger . CETSHWAYO Danger ? Where ? For whom ? BAFIKILE Blood speaks to blood . The English and the Boers may fraternise in the end , and both stand against us .

You would make the King a laughing stock among the people ! Have I not already heard that the King hesitates while the warrior-leaders are bold and impatient ! CETSHWAYO Repeat that ! NKOSIKAZI Do n't be angry with me . Be angry with her . She it is would make you the gossip of the people . People see and talk , imagine and create . CETSHWAYO Say they Cetshwayo is afraid ?

( He and Nkosikazi go out . ) BAFIKILE See what has happened ! My heart no longer bleeds  --  it is all blood . CETSHWAYO The path is long and rough . But I will wash my assagais and return to claim you . Now , give me a moment of joy . BAFIKILE You speak strange things . CETSHWAYO Strange things we have seen and heard before . Wherefore should we not embrace the strange in love ? THE VOICE Bayede ! ( Enter Mnyamana . ) CETSHWAYO Where is she ? MNYAMANA She is at the lower path waiting for me to escort her back . CETSHWAYO What news makes you keep a queen waiting , and disturb a king at feast ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thou King . The Lion has gone to join the blest ancestral hosts . Let me be the first to hail you . . . Bayede ! ( Bafikile and he kneel before Cetshwayo whose whole expression has changed . He stands erect , looks fierce and agitated , and stares before him as one in a trance . ) CETSHWAYO Ah ! Now ' t is I ! The Curtain Falls@@ Sheptone 's office in Pietermaritzburg . Sheptone 's chief clerk is filing documents and dispatches . Sir Bartle Frere is just leaving Shepstone 's office where the two men have obviously been discussing the problem of Cetshwayo . As he moves towards the door , Sir Frere , who is in uniform , speaks . FRERE Again I must ask you to think seriously about what Whitehall says . The matter is critical . Remember the final decision depends very largely on the advice you give me . ( He salutes involuntarily and strides out , Shepstone returning the salute as absentmindedly . ) SHEPSTONE ( Mumbling defiantly and sarcastically . ) He and Whitehall ! Telling me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and the Natives ? I know the Native  --  his customs , psychology , needs and weaknesses . ( He goes to his desk and examines some documents . Park , the clerk , steals questioning glances at him , now and again . Shepstone paces about as he reads or thinks . Enter a junior clerk . ) CLERK A dispatch for you , Sir . ( Exit . ) SHEPSTONE ( Reading . ) Ah ! The missionaries , too , want the overthrow of Cetshwayo . For once we see eye to eye with the blind idealists and heavenly simpletons . But how widely our reasons differ ! They complain of witchcraft , immoral orgies and murder . . . as if these things count when we Europeans deceive , plunder and murder daily for power ! I wonder what the Colenso fanatics think ? ( Re-enter junior clerk. ) p. 57 CLERK Another dispatch , Sir . ( Exit . ) SHEPSTONE ( Reading . ) From the farmers  --  men whose minds , like their labour , remain on the ground and never rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) PARK ( Aside . ) He means indispensable men whose minds and labour bring forth fruit and life  --  because they are always so near Nature and God . SHEPSTONE They too want Zulu power destroyed . ( Aside . ) I must be careful about that rogue , Dunn . I 'm afraid he runs with the hare and chases with the hounds . ( He goes to his desk , takes out a document , hands it over to Park , the chief clerk . ) SHEPSTONE Now , Park , you have had a chance to study this document before . Here is a copy to refresh your memory . I invite your frank criticism and whatever suggestions you have . I depend on your judgement . My policy , I think , is best . There is the policy of savage dictatorship practised by their ignorant chiefs ; there is that of total repression advocated by the Dutch ; finally , there is Sir George Grey 's policy of assimilation . I reject them all . My policy is to recognise Native custom and law in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Christianity and civilisation . I want to civilise the Natives along their own lines  --  not to make them artificial Europeans . p. 58 PARK It seems to me , Sir , your policy seeks to create two different civilisations and two conflicting states in one country at one and the same time . It seems impossible to me , Sir . It would be dangerous even if it were possible . You can not have two parallel lines that do not meet in human affairs where life is relative . Human influences , feelings , thoughts and actions seep and penetrate through the strongest walls . To my mind , Sir , there is no western and eastern , white or black , civilisation . Like God , these things have no plural , are one , and are for you , me , them , all . I mean the reality , not the confusing manifestations . If you want Natives to develop along their own lines , you will be forced to dictate what those lines must be , sooner or later . Else how can it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social and political institutions , and maintaining their race integrity . PARK It seems your policy seeks to distinguish races and not to recognise individuals . Yet it appears to me , Sir , that the genius , the soul , the aspirations and progress of a race depend largely and find the best outlet and the highest expression in the individual  --  in the most talented of its sons and daughters . You , Sir , are an example . You are shaping the future and the destiny of the British race in this country . SHEPSTONE But I have made provision for educated , progressive Natives . They will be exempted from the operation of Native law . p. 59 PARK Still I see difficulties . SHEPSTONE Where and in what way ? PARK Your policy might defeat its own ends , unless it is so amended , in the future , as to be repressive . As time goes on and more Natives become educated and civilised , the European will either be engulfed by the flood of educated Natives , or devise means to keep back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the educated , cultured and exempted Native . You want Natives to develop along their own lines . Yet even now you are compelled to dictate the lines . For the truth is that they are developing along their own lines at present . But you are against it . It does not suit you . Hence your policy . very foundations of Native law and custom . Your appointed Supreme Guardian is not only against the idea and custom of hereditary Chieftainship , but will have autocratic powers to make and enforce law . The African Chief is hereditary and is under the power of the tribal council . In the draft you intend creating many petty Chiefs who will have no real power but will be responsible to the Government . These Chiefs will be your police and puppets under a Native Affairs Department that will see that they never get absolute liberty and their full rights , or enter the centre of the maelstrom of progress . Thus your Native Affairs Department , set up ostensibly to protect and help the Natives will , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be sacrificed . Your codification of Native law will arrest the development of that law and Native ideas and customs . I have no doubt of your good intentions nor of the success of your policy under wise and moral administrators . What worries me is that unscrupulous legislators and administrators of tomorrow might abuse your policy for their own evil ends . p. 60 SHEPSTONE So you think there is little chance of the document making a good impression and of its being accepted ? PARK On the contrary , Sir , and for the very reasons or criticisms I have given , I think it will make a very good impression on the mind of the public and the Government , and will promptly be accepted . SHEPSTONE Confound you ! What do you mean ? PARK Because it is a most ingenious and effective instrument for maintaining white supremacy . It will give the Europeans the opportunity and excuse to protect and advance their own interests under the guise and pretext of being benevolent guardians of the Natives . The Natives themselves will praise it as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their racial integrity . Few will see through it ; and of those few , few will have the courage to stand up against it and its puppet chiefs because it will seem a betrayal of their race , and an unpatriotic fight against the recognition and preservation of their cultural and social heritage . Those who dare will be branded and rejected by both sides  --  the Europeans calling them agitators and aping idiots ; the Natives ostracising them as usurpers and deserters . Thus their opportunist leaders , thinking of their immediate personal gains and prestige , and not of the ultimate greater gain and progress of the race , will stand up for the system and for the Chiefs , supporting with specious and patriotic arguments the retainment of customs and usages that will help perpetuate their serfdom , or , at least , retard their progress . ( Enter a junior clerk who hands a dispatch to Shepstone , and goes out . Shepstone reads it , frowns and becomes visibly excited , and paces up and down the office . When he speaks next , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a serious discussion with Park. ) p. 61 SHEPSTONE I tell you the only thing is to precipitate war to overthrow Cetshwayo . The sparse European population is in constant danger of a Zulu invasion , and the only way to keep Natives under control is to smash the Zulu military power . PARK Sir , does n't the white man weaken his own position and expose himself to danger by his very craze to own great stretches of land that separate him not only from his European neighbours , but from the stream of civilisation , and plunge him in the maelstrom of Native culture ? SHEPSTONE ( Absentmindedly , reading dispatch . ) Y-yes , yes . Do you think so ? PARK I mean . . . it seems strange that in a sparsely populated country such as this there should be land hunger and land disputes . SHEPSTONE ( Stops reading dispatch , but keeps it in his hand . ) As I was saying  --  we must fight and destroy Cetshwayo . This is our only salvation . Already there is a widespread process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result of Cetshwayo 's foreign policy and his far-flung emissaries . The risings in the Cape , the exploits of Sekhukhune , the insubordination of Lobengula 's subjects , can all be traced back to Cetshwayo 's policy and plot . He wants to unite the various tribes into one strong nation that will be a menace to us. p. 62 PARK He must be an influential man and a wise diplomat to be able to . . . . SHEPSTONE Do n't call a savage a diplomat ! He must be taught a lesson ! PARK Can not treaties and friendly negotiations help settle these matters without recourse to hostilities ? SHEPSTONE Who wants treaties , agreements and consultation with Natives ? They must be made submissive and be taught and forced to obey the law  --  our law . PARK I understand , Sir . SHEPSTONE ( Earnest ; putting away the dispatch . ) No , you do n't . Listen . We want war . We must have war . We shall have war . The Home Government , the Colonial Secretary and others have tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why ? The defeat of Cetshwayo and the control of the Native population would mean a great source of wealth by means of taxation ; would provide an unfailing reservoir of labour ; appease the Transvaal Volksraad , pacify and win over the Boers , and settle once and for all the boundary disputes between black and white . Her Majesty 's Government refuses to give us more loans and subsidies , the Transvaal Boers are unable to raise money or pay enough taxes to run their Republic efficiently . The Republic is in danger of a Zulu invasion . Its defeat  --  and there is not the slightest doubt that Cetshwayo can wipe them out  --  would jeopardise our own position here . Vital issues are at stake . If civilisation and white supremacy are to be maintained in this country , the Natives must be demilitarised . It is not a question of ethics . It is one of arms and government . He who has power rules and dictates . ( They are so engrossed in their discussion that they have not noticed Miss Harriette Colenso who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to you in the name of justice and fair play , Mr Shepstone . SHEPSTONE W-what d-do you m-mean ? I mean how did you come in here ? HARRIETTE Through the door , of course ! ( Park chuckles silently . ) SHEPSTONE This is a private office , and it is not customary to have visitors come in unannounced . In fact it is not done . HARRIETTE Custom stales . Accustom yourself to forget custom sometimes . It seems to me Cetshwayo deserves our thanks and help . Is it not true that his armies have contributed to your diplomatic triumphs in negotiations with the Transvaal Republic ? SHEPSTONE How dare you , madam ! HARRIETTE Is it not just and fair to recognise these things ? SHEPSTONE These matters have nothing to do with justice and religion . These are questions of hard facts and political realism . This world is not governed by justice . If it were it would be heaven . But , even you , madam , see no angels here . HARRIETTE Do n't deceive yourself . I see many angels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven has no need of justice . It is the world that needs it . It is the injustices here that call for justice , just as heaven receives its meaning from hell . p. 64 SHEPSTONE Well , then , we must have hell if only to preserve and give meaning to heaven . And , believe me , there will be hell ! HARRIETTE You blame men when things go wrong . You make them the scapegoats . Yet it is not men , but things that are out of order . SHEPSTONE Madam , it only shows how ignorant you are of men and things ! The stars move in their orbits , the rivers in their course . Trees stand where they stood , and grass is still green . Birds and beasts obey their instincts , and Nature returns the same everlasting answer . It is men who are shiftless and muddled . A savage monarch , arrogant and infatuated with adulation and power , threatens our work , happiness and very existence . . . and you come and defend him ! My dear lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . HARRIETTE Pooh ! Pooh ! Have you no conscience , Mr Shepstone ? SHEPSTONE My conscience tells me conscience is nonsense ! HARRIETTE Oh ! Really , Mr Shepstone , this work has paralysed your feelings . You need a holiday to gain balance and regain your conscience . SHEPSTONE Conscience , madam , is the sum of our breeding and experiences . And your experiences and breeding are not mine ! Good afternoon ! HARRIETTE How dare you , Mr Shepstone !

SHEPSTONE ( Patting him paternally into a chair . ) Your wounds are healed . You will be avenged . Cetshwayo will perish ! The Curtain Falls@@ Cetshwayo in Council . Royal Bard sings praises . CETSHWAYO The Council is the eyes and ears , the mouth and hands of the land . The British Government has sent me a warning . They say I should disband the army , cease to kill even wizards , and . . . iya ! A fit of blood seizes me when I speak of these things ! From the day I ascended the throne the Europeans have been pestering me about this and that , here and there , day and night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bayede ! A king must wash his assagais . No king is king merely by sitting astride a throne . A king is king by fulfilling the offices and the demands of kingship . Since the King ascended the throne he has not washed the armies . They are dirty and corrupt with peace . I thought we all thought the Boers or the Swazis would provide an excellent washing pool for this purpose . NDABUKO Thou of heaven ! I have one word only to say . It is this : the warriors want a chance to fight and gain distinction ; to fight and win battles so that they may win cattle to win wives and thus win manhood , pleasure and prestige . That is my word . DABULAMANZI They keep on talking ! We  --  we want action before we speak . Come , my boys ! ( Enter two well-built warriors chosen by Dabulamanzi for their skill in the art of stick fighting . The assembly murmurs in praise , admiration and excitement. ) p. 67 DABULAMANZI All life is friction , Warm living action ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The two warriors fight desperately and with great skill as the people shout excitedly . ) A VOICE The glory of the land ! The meaning of our name ! DABULAMANZI Part ! ( The warriors obey sharply , and go out panting but happy . ) What does the white man say ! Tell me . He did not say we should disband the army ? Not that , surely . Have you not just seen for yourselves ? What ? Cease to do all this . . . this joy and glory ? The white man jokes . He is mad . Or is he being insolent and after trouble ? We fight because it is life to fight . We fight to gain health , wealth and strength . We fight to please and appease blest Ancestral Spirits . War is tradition . War is regeneration . It is liberation . ' T is war mothers the spark of manhood and great nations . ' T is war solves our many human problems . Who says we must not fight ? Come forth , coward , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What is peace ? Where is peace ? There is no peace in peace . Peace is war invisible . In battle singing warriors fall at the hands of great men and brave . In times of so-called peace noble souls grovel at , and are trodden by the feet of scoundrels . Peace gives the evil men their chance . They kill . They despoil . They corrupt . People are tired of the invisible but deadly blows of foes who operate in times of corroding peace . p. 68 CETSHWAYO ( Touched . ) It is enough . Go over and call the Government 's messenger . We will tell him . . . tell them ! ( An Induna goes out . ) ZWANA It is oppressive . No one knows which way the wind blows . DABULAMANZI I see , but what I see is dust-laden . I think the English will not attack us . The things they mention mean nothing . They have always been here . They have not been hatched today . Has the Government been blind all along ? Why should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somtsewu vow friendship with us ? Or does he stick close to us parasite-like to suck us to death ? Are we people who are no people ? ZWANA The white man knows us not ! Yet better so ! NDABUKO They know that to have no army would be to expose ourselves to destruction . They also know that we want to fight , not them , but the Boers or the Swazis . And who are the English to play protectors of nations ? ZWANA That is truth . ' T is the Boers we would attack . They ill-treat and enslave the people . They take sides in our disputes . They want our land and cattle . These English are a hindrance . They are omnipresent . Wherever you go , they trip your leg . They are grass that covers the whole land , and grass-knots in the path of other would-be conquerors . They would protect all . p. 69 MNYAMANA In that lies the danger . They would protect even our enemies against us . They would fight even friends in the name of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection that is destruction . They try to keep peace where there is no peace , and see trouble where there is none . In the end the English will be hated by all nations . By trying to be friends to all , they will be friend to none . They are more dangerous and subtle than the Boers . MDETA We stand midst a circle of fire . It narrows . MNYAMANA I do not like it ! I mean the way the missionaries , the Government and the Europeans who claim to know us do things . While we go about our business , they stir dust by discussing us . They argue about us without consulting us . MDETA I 've never been impressed by these men of the God of the chosen few . ZWANA You mean the men who speak of a King they know not , and who ask us to embrace what they themselves have not found ? NDABUKO They want to divide the nation . They wax loud about the killing of people , yet they destroy more souls and would even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) But the missionaries are on our side . I mean the Sobantus .

Zibhebhu , Somtsewu , Hamu , Jantoni . . . where do these men stand , men ? MDETA Your word is ours . Like others , Somtsewu is white . CETSHWAYO So are you all . . . all white before me here ! Behind me , black ! As black and fearful as caves unknown to Man since first he came . Now would I offer everything to know friends that are friends  --  and friends of my position only . Was e'er a man in such a position placed  --  to choose twixt friend and friend , and foe and foe ? To tell what 's good in bad , what bad in good ? Was e'er a man surrounded , plagued by enemies who are friends , friends that are foes ? Now am I told friends to distrust and foes befriend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here are no foes to fear except those within . Within this conflict looms an inner war . Helping the foe , another stands unseen . Within us , deadly , poised ! Cursed they surrounded thus ! MDETA ( Aside . ) Of whom does the Black One speak ? ZWANA ( Aside . ) Of himself to himself . How lonely he stands among us , it seems ! NDABUKO ( Aside . ) ' T is whispered the King was told by a seer not to wash the assagais in the English stream . The snag is , how can he attack the Boers or the Swazis without touching the flooded waters of the English river that completely surrounds his kraal ? p. 71 MNYAMANA My Lord , I speak what I see .

NDABUKO ( Aside to Zwana . ) The land is dead when Zulus speak thus ! MNYAMANA This is what I say . For nearly a generation now , our armies have had no strenuous battle practice except clashes among themselves . The Government is strong and will act if we move against the Boers or the Swazi . Let us not throw ourselves blindly into the blade of the enemy . Our ultimate struggle must be with the English . So let us deceive them by compromise while we prepare hard and relentlessly for that mighty final struggle . ( The words receive a mixed reception as the murmurs tell .

MESSENGER Bayede ! The Government sends word that the King disband the army forthwith ; that there be no shedding of blood ; that no life be taken without Her Majesty 's Government 's knowledge and consent ; that minor cases be punishable by loss of property , not by death ; that there be no condemnation without a fair trial . The Government says Her Majesty , the great white Queen , is alarmed to find that the King has not kept the promises he made when he was crowned . That is the message , Bayede . The document I have already handed over . CETSHWAYO Tell me , who is this king that I , the King , must obey ? Who is this king that would king kings ? I know of one only . . . ' t is he who speaks . There is one king of kings in this country . . . you stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I am all ears . CETSHWAYO You speak of promises . Did you ever hear of kings making promises to other than their own ? Kings act and leave the evil of promise to lesser men . To promise is to admit inability and uncertainty , to admit a greater authority . Thus promise defeats promise . I made no promises . ' T is the English who made rules and tried to impose them upon me . Our laws come down from generation to generation . Does the white man tell me to disobey the sacred laws of our great Ancestors ? Does Somtsewu in whom , it was said , the Past lives , understand these things , or is the English part of him trying to destroy the Zulu part ? What right has the white man to dictate to me in my own free country ? Do I go and dictate in their affairs , in their country ? I am bull here , and none other may come and bellow around . Try who dares . . . and he goes the way Mbuyazi went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The words of the King live and speak . CETSHWAYO If any would speak  --  here is the messenger . NDABUKO What is wrong with the Boers and the English ! They claim that King Dingana gave them land and that they defeated us . Now , both complain about the might of our armies , and seek protection from our warriors . They speak about land treaties they made in the past . But now they wrangle about land boundaries . Where is victory , and where agreement in all this ? Who ever heard of the selling of the nation 's lands ? Are these people tricksters and pretenders or are they foolish and blind ? ZWANA Who appointed the white man our customs to teach us ? They will have ceased to be our customs and ways when he can teach us these . Then , his teaching will be vain . We 'll not go back again .

Why do they give us so short a time to answer when they know full well these things can not be decided upon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are swollen and impassable , and that their own messenger will be delayed . Why was the message not delivered earlier ? Is this haste  --  this delay  --  a means to precipitate war ? Are the rumours not true that the white man has long been preparing for war and has actually mobilised his forces before ascertaining our views and position ? p. 74 DABULAMANZI Who is our ruler ? We are our rulers ! We seem to have rulers ruled , not ruling . If he wants to rule , let the white man try  --  if he can ! If it is our King they want to remain ruler , let them let him rule . What we do not want is this muddle and tragedy of living under uncrowned kings reigning , and recognised kings , muzzled . We are ruled by office kings , not enthroned ones . But stay ! Who is the white man to stand king over us ? Why is the King  --  and we his people  --  persecuted , hunted and insulted ? Did we mobilise our troops and customs against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it not the white man 's armies and evils that have been mobilised against us ? Who will work for the King if the army is disbanded ? The army is the servant . It is the scavenger . It is the bulwark , might and glory of the King . How can the King  --  any king  --  live without these services and servants ? Where will youth 's blood be cooled if not in these labours ? Must it be cooled by being warmed in the dissipating , viscid stream of sex , inactivity and lack of discipline ? To deprive a people of its military organisation is to cripple and enslave them . Where are the King 's lands ? The white man has stolen them  --  the land where the King 's cattle grazed , where the nation 's virgins would have been born . All we reap from the stolen land is evil and confusion . We reap but ghosts of our name and might . I , Dabulamanzi , can say this only . . . let the King let us cry , To battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle ! To battle ! BARD He makes them smile ; he makes them cry . A mover of men is he ! DABULAMANZI Here are no words needed . Everything calls for action . Therefore , I rise to thank the King for calling us together . He only is the risen spirit of Shaka . We thank thee , O King , for breathing into the lifeless body of the nation the fiery soul of Shaka . You will fight and conquer . You will call and we shall come . If our land has been taken , our power weakened , our existence threatened , the day for reckoning has come . We shall be avenged . Great things will happen . It is time to prepare and act .

DUNN Every able-bodied man is a trained warrior and . . . . CHELMSFORD Bah ! That does not worry me . What I mean is their willingness , determination and ability to fight . Mr Shepstone thinks they have no stomach to do so . And I notice that they have been retreating before us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what I know of them I would n't be over optimistic and make hurried conclusions . When they choose to , they can fight like lions . As to their retreat , every bush you find may be full of them , watching and planning . CHELMSFORD I will see to that . You can help us by showing us the best ways across rivers and bushes . And , where possible , let us know about their position and movements . DUNN I shall . ( With a sparkle in his eye and a mischievous smile . ) What a rapid advance you 've made ! No wonder they are not ready to meet you , yet . It seems the ultimatum was served when you were already on the march . I know the country and the distances well . CHELMSFORD ( Aside . ) The devil knows too much ! ( Aloud . ) You say , not ready to meet us , yet . Do you imply that they will soon be ? p. 80 DUNN Well , since you are here , they can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did not want to fight you , but the Dutch . CHELMSFORD I understand . We 'll make them fight  --  or surrender . Have you anything more to say ? DUNN Nothing  --  save to request time and permission to see to the safety of my home and dependants . CHELMSFORD ( Knowingly . ) Of course ! Of course ! I shall get you men to help you , if necessary . ( Enter a messenger who salutes . ) CHELMSFORD Your message ? MESSENGER A Boer farmer has come to see you , Sir . CHELMSFORD What does the fellow want ? Did he give you a message ? MESSENGER Well . . . yes . . . unofficially , Sir . He told us he has come to warn you to make laagers whenever and wherever you camp . CHELMSFORD A forward , insolent and garrulous fool ! Tell him to wait . ( Growling almost to himself . ) Telling me about my work ! MESSENGER Yes , Sir . ( Salutes and goes out. ) p. 81 CHELMSFORD I 've heard of your excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can not expect comparison . But come , let 's have one . ( Prepares drinks . ) DUNN You are generous . I am honoured . CHELMSFORD Not at all . It is a pleasure . ( As they start to drink , the trumpet sounds . They toast and then stand to attention . ) The Curtain Falls
