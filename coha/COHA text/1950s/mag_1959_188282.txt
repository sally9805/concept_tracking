ENDURANCE ( 282 pp. ) - Alfred Lanslnq - McGraw- Hill ( $5 ) . <P> <P> Britain 's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition in 1915 was as foolish in conception as it was heroic in outcome . Both ends of the scale were weighted by heavy-jawed Sir Ernest ( " The Boss ' ' ) Shackleton , who in 1909 had gone to within 97 miles of the South Pole . Shackleton had one trouble : he was a towering egotist . As an apprentice in the British merchant navy , he was termed " the most pigheaded , obstinate boy I have ever come across " by his first skipper . Born a middle-class Irishman , he burned to force his way to the top of Britain 's upper crust-and chose the polar route for the expedition . <P> Though knighted and lionized at 35 for his 1909 journey to Antarctica , Shackleton in 1914 was frantic because the great goals were disappearing . The North Pole had fallen to U.S. Explorer Robert E. Peary in 1909 , the South Pole to Norway 's Roald Amundsen in 1911 . Shackleton conceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sledging across the continent via the Pole to the Pacific . He called it " the largest and most striking of all journeys . " The Royal Geographical Society was cool to the idea-as well it might be . The feat was not achieved until 43 years later , when Britain 's Sir Vivian Fuchs last year took 99 days to travel the route , using heated tractors and reconnaissance airplanes . <P> No Prayer of Rescue . Yet Shackleton would not be dissuaded , and Alfred Lansing has crisply re-created one of the most audacious assaults that Antarctica ever defeated . Shackleton sailed from Buenos Aires in October 1914 , with 69 dogs , no radio transmitter , and a motley crew of 27 volunteers . He put his faith in Endurance , a barkentine ( 144 ft. long , 25 ft. wide ) with a reinforced hull and 350-h.p. auxiliary steam engine . Three months later Endurance was in the Weddell Sea , a vast , bowl-shaped scoop in the Atlantic coast of Antarctica , and there the ice packs began kneading her . <P> Shackleton never got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the vise of a null ice pack for ten months , Endurance drifted 1,000 miles northward off the Palmer Peninsula . Finally the party abandoned the crushed wreck and stood on the floe , some 300 miles from land . The men tried dragging boats across the ice in search of open water ; they had to quit after two miles . For five more months , they camped in the open , drifting , drifting . There was the sad rite of shooting the dogs , the terror of being dragged off the ice by vicious 1,100-Ib. sea leopards that could leap from the water and catch a running man . The expedition physicist scrawled in his tattered diary : " A bug on a single molecule of oxygen in a gale of wind would have about the same chance of predicting where he was likely to finish up .
