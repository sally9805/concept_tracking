Adolf Hitler called them the " Order of Good Blood , " and gave them for a symbol a grinning death's-head . In ten dreadful years , they butchered millions , making good their master 's boast that men should " grow sick at the sight of their black coats . " At Niirnberg , before the court of world opinion , they were forever condemned for crimes against humanity . Yet last week the SS ( full name : Schutzstaffel ) marched again , jack boots ringing on the cobblestones of the garrison town of Verden in lower Saxony . <P> Steel Helmets . The occasion seemed harmless : since SS troops are not eligible for veterans ' pensions , two former generals of SS combat divisions had formed an SS old soldiers society ; last week they held a rally in Verden 's soccer stadium . From all over Germany , even from South America , came more than 5,000 delegates . Welcomed by the Bur germeister , the SSmen made merry in Verden 's beer gardens . <P> Then came the rally . Hitler 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ramcke , 63 , was supposed to give a three-minute talk-for old times ' sake . Instead , he launched a savage attack on the " real war criminals " - the Western Allies . The criminals , Ramcke bellowed into a swelling torrent of applause , " are not the German front-line soldiers . . . They are those who made the Versailles Treaty . . . who shattered German cities . . . who dropped atomic bombs on Nagasaki . . . who are producing new atomic bombs . " <P> Black Lists . Hastily the rally 's organizers passed along notes to the speaker , urging him first to moderate his language , then to sit down . But Ramcke ground on like a Tiger tank . I am proud , he roared , to have been on the " black lists " of the Allies . " One day they will become the lists of honor . " At that the SSmen leaped to their feet , jack boots stamping . " Eisenhower Schweinehund " they chanted . <P> Next day , the air waves from Bonn dripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rally came a contrite disavowal of everything old Ramcke had said-but no explanation of the cheers Ramcke 's words had got . Konrad Adenauer 's government issued the understatement of the week : " Ramcke should realize that his remarks can not bolster Germany 's reputation in the world . "
