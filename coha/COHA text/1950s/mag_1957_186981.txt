A major force behind the weak civil rights bill passed by the Senate a fortnight ago was the support given it by leaders of such organizations as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Americans for Democratic Action ( TIME , Aug. 19 ) . A major reason for last week 's agreement on a stronger bill was the angry reaction of Negro leaders against the organizations ' capitulation . <P> Out of the White House early in the week came samples of messages from 21 prominent civil rights men , e.g. , U.N . Official Ralph Bunche , retired Baseball Star Jack Robinson and A. Philip Randolph , president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters , urging the Administration to stand pat for a strong bill . From such leading Negro newspapers as the Norfolk Journal and Guide and New York 's Amsterdam News came outspoken criticism of the N.A.A.C.P. leaders who had agreed to the weak bill . Said the Amsterdam News : " When we find the N.A.A.C.P. 's Secretary , Roy Wilkins , sleeping in the same political bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder about Mr. Wilkins . ' ' <P> In defense , the N.A.A.C.P. finally moved to shore up the strong-bill position of House Republican Leader Joe Martin . Wired N.A.A.C.P. Washington Director Clarence Mitchell to Martin : " Your efforts to obtain passage of a civil rights bill in the House have been and still are of great value and are deeply appreciated . . . We have never felt that the Senate bill was sufficiently strong . "
