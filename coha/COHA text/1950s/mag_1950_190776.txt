The U.S. was soundly pummeled during a meeting of the Institute of Pacific Relations which ended last week in Lucknow , India . The Asiatic members waded in with all the anti-American postwar squawks which are becoming more &; more popular in Asia , in part because so many Americans attach undue importance to what other nations think ( or say they think ) about the U.S. <P> For instance , many delegates complained that the U.S. had acted in Korea , but had not taken sides in the dispute between India and Pakistan over Kashmir . This was supposed to prove that the U.S. did not really care about Asia , but only intervened when its own ( or Russian ) interests were involved . <P> The usual American reaction to this sort of thing is to keep quiet and look vaguely guilty . One American at Lucknow did not feel that way about it . Robert North , of Stanford University , summed up his reactions to the Asiatic criticism of the West . Said he : <P> " If the West gives aid it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be denounced for its indifference ; if it establishes garrisons it will be attacked as expansionist ; if it keeps its troops at home it assures success of aggression in Asia ; if it expresses no political preferences it will be accused of siding with reaction and the status quo ; if it supports progressive forces it will be condemned for intervention . <P> " In other words , we are damned if we do and damned if we don't.
