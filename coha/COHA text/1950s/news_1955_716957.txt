txt BENSON CONSIDERS RISE OF 2 BILLIONS IN PRICE SUPPORTS Farm Surpluses May Force Request for New Funds to Increase ' Cushion ' STUDY BACKS HIGH PROPS House Unit Attacks Flexible System  --  Cites Retail Climb Despite Dairy Decline By WILLIAM M. BLAIR Soecfal to The New York Times . WASHINGTON , March 26 ? Farm surpluses may force the Administration to ask Congress for $2,000,000,000 more this year for price-support operations . Top aides of Ezra Taft Benson , Secretary of Agriculture , have been discussing this possibility as the amount of Federal funds invested in farm price supports nears new peaks . It was understood that the officials believed the cushion left in the $10,000,000,000 borrowing authority of the Commodity Credit Corporation might be too little to last through the fall because of the surplus increase . The Administration placed the blame for the build-up on the high rigid support prices . A flexible price support system , which will be in effect on 1955 crops , was won by the Administration after a bitter fight last year . As of now , officials estimate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer , This leaves only $1 , - 500,000,000 to take care of crops yet to come into Government storage under Federal support loans . ? Benson Is Concerned Secretary Benson has expressed concern privately . However , he hopes late spring and early summer surveys will show that , production adjustments are taking hold sufficiently to avoid raising the C. C. C. ceiling . Another increase in the C.C.C . authority would be the third since the Administration took office in 1953 . The first was from 56,750,000,000 to 58,500,000,000 . The second , to $10,000,000,000 , came last year . A. request for a further rise in price-support funds could have an important political effect in Congress . It conceivably could hold in line many farm-bloc Republicans and Northern Democrats who broke with highsupport advocates and voted for flexible price props . The possibility that C. C. C. would run out of money was ' posed as Representative Harold D. Cooley , chairman of the House of Representatives Agriculture Committee , made public a staff study for restoration of rigid price supports . It showed , the North Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmer and will not help the consumer . " The target of his statement was the flexible price-support system . It is geared to supply and demand with lower supports in time of high production and high supports in period of low production to encourage output . The variable supports range from 821/2 to 90 per cent of parity on corn , cotton , wheat , rice and peanuts . They replaced the mandatory 90 per cent level in effect for a decade on corn , wheat , cotton , rice , peanuts and // tobacco . The mandatory 90 per cent was retained . on tobacco . Parity is a Government formula designed to give the farmer a fair return for his production . The only measurable flexibile ity this year will be in wheat and corn . Wheat support will be at the legal floor of 82.32 per cent . Corn will be 87 per cent . The other " basic " crops probably will be 90 per cent because of ? severe production cutbacks under Federal controls . In 1956 , however , the flexible scale will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law . Mr. Cooley 's House committee has reported a bill that would renew . the rigid supports . In issuing the committee staff report oh the effect of recent declines in farm prices on over-all retail prices , he noted that farm prices had fallen 22 per cent from a high in February , 1951 , to the end of 1954 . In the same period , he said " the average of retail food costs remained unchanged , close to the post-war peak . " Labor Costs Cited The study showed that since 1947-49 prices received by farmers for dairy products had declined 8 per cent while retail prices on dairy products had risen 6 per cent . The farm price of food grains dropped 9 per cent while bakery products at retail climbed 22 per cent , and fruit and vegetable producers received 4 per cent less while consumers paid 12 per cent more , the report said . " An important reason for the upward trend in marketing costs over a period of years is the increased packaging between the farm gate and the consumer 's door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounted for a part of the farmto-table spread . Wage rates for workers in marketing farm food products increased from $1.23 an hour in 1947-49 to about $1.70 in 1954 , it said . Indilstrial workers now can buy more food with the earnings from one hour of labor " than in any earlier period in history , " the study said . It gave these examples : Bread , 6.4 pounds in 1929 and 10.4 pounds in 1954 ; round steak , 1.2 pounds in 1929 and two pounds in 1954 ; butter , one pound in 1929 and 2.5 pounds in 1954 ; milk , 3.9 quarts in 1929 and 7.8 quarts in 1954 ; potatoes , ' 17.1 pounds in 1929 and 35.2 pounds in 1954. ( hut of each dollar spent by the housewife for domestically produced food , 57 cents now goes for processing , marketing and transportation charges , the report said , while the farmer receives 43 cents . Of the farmer 's share , about 30 cents goes for tractors , trucks , plows , gasoline , fertilizer . and other supplies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents out of each consumer dollar for their work and investment , the report concluded .
