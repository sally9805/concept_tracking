Mao Tse-tung had called for honest criticism of his government and , lo , from Canton to Chungking there was criticism . The walls of Peking University blazed with multicolored placards pointedly demanding " What is more precious than individual liberty ? " , angrily proclaiming that " Graduate students know very little because they are allowed to study only Russian methods in physics lab . " Engineer Li Pei Ying of Tientsin declared : " Intellectuals live a life that is less peaceful than it was under Japanese or Kuomintang rule . " <P> Inevitably , some of the critics went beyond the bounds outlined by Chairman Mao in his now famous " secret " speeches ( TIME , May 27 et seq . ) . Chu An Ping , editor of the Kwangming Daily , which speaks for Red China 's eight tame " democratic " parties , had the temerity to suggest criticism of Mao himself : " People have raised many opinions against the junior monks , but no one has yet said anything about the old monks . " <P> Aging ( 69 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the tough , tight-fisted war lord of Yunnan province , took a crack at the most sacrosanct foreign idol of all . Said General Lung , now a vice chairman of Red China 's National Defense Council : " It is totally unfair for the People 's Republic of China to pay all the expenses of the Korean War . The U.S. has given up her claims for loans she granted to her allies during the first and second world wars , yet the Soviet Union insists that China must pay interest on Soviet loans . " He would like to know , Lung added , whether the U.S.S.R. intended to reimburse China for the " huge quantities of industrial equipment " which were carted out of Manchuria by Soviet troops after World War II . <P> Wrecking Praises . Four months ago when Mao insisted that the time had come to begin hothouse cultivation of " the hundred flowers " of criticism , the suspicion was that he was looking for noxious weeds to bare their heads to the party scythe . He had to wait awhile ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before China 's timid intellectuals found the courage to raise their voices . For his attack on Mao , Editor Chu An Ping was suspended from his party . General Lung 's co-workers publicly rebuked him for " slandering the Soviet Union with malice . " Critics could expect vigorous counter-criticism , but as yet there was-no evidence that they would suffer worse . The basic fact about their criticism is that the West 's knowledge of it comes solely from Communist sources : the official newspapers first trumpet the criticism then later reject it ; all is controlled . <P> Last week , in a kind of " State of the Union " speech to Red China 's dummy Parliament , Premier Chou En-lai insisted that the Communists have achieved " basic victory in our socialist revolution " - partly by executing " 16.8% of the counterrevolutionaries dealt with . " Nonetheless , Chou went on , there were " remnants of counter-revolutionaries still trying to engage in wrecking activities . " There were even people , he conceded , " who keep complaining because China 's living standards are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
