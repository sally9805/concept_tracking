In Lincoln-Mercury showrooms this week , well-heeled auto buyers inspected the new $10,238 Mark IV Continental limousine . Priced nearly $3,000 above the top of the 1957 line , a $7,500 convertible , the Continental includes as standard equipment $2,044 worth of accessories and usually optional equipment . These range from a $25 chrome curb-guard molding , up through electric doorlocks ( $59.15 for four doors ) to dual radios ( $152.70 apiece ) and dual air conditioners ( $440 apiece ) . When the retractable curved-glass partition between the front and back seats is up , passengers and chauffeur can listen to different radio programs in individually adjusted air conditioning . Like the original model T , the limousine comes in just one color , black .
