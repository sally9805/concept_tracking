BATTLE OF INDOCHINA <P> In Paris , General de Lattre de Tassigny read the news with pursed lips : the expected offensive had come ; 30,000 Viet Minh Communists were attacking the eastern end of the highway between Hanoi and the port of Haiphong . Already , the French had lost four small outposts along Route Coloniale No. 18 . <P> De Lattre wasted no time . With his government 's promise of 15,000 picked reinforcements soon to come , he boarded his Constellation for Indo-China . As he flew over India , the news from IndoChina was bad : the Reds had come close enough to cut the Haiphong water supply . De Lattre ordered his pilot to fly direct to Haiphong , but the same crachin mist which was giving cover to the Communists prevented the big Constellation from landing . De Lattre landed at Saigon , rode a light plane back to Haiphong , took charge of the battle . <P> His deputies had acted with praiseworthy caution while he was away . They had not committed the precious French mobile reserve to the defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the French had retreated slowly . <P> As soon as the mist cleared , De Lattre sent in his Hellcats and B-26s with bombs and napalm .

Four days later the French reopened Route Coloniale No. 18 . <P> Meanwhile , coming down the Sontay valley to the west were more Communists , this time threatening Hanoi .

After two days ' steady fighting , the French threw the Communists back with a loss of 500 dead , 1,500 wounded . In the recaptured territory the French found another French officer tortured to death . <P> The offensive had been a major defeat for Ho Chi Minh . On the Red radio , he told his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to their former guerrilla tactics .
