To those in charge of screening the annual 9,000 applicants for teaching jobs in Cincinnati 's public schools , the papers of the clean-cut , 38-year-old Negro seemed in perfect order . True enough , Henry Fordham seemed nervous when interviewed . He was , reported the board of interviewers , " not too coherent , " and he used " big words , often incorrectly . " But he did have a document to prove that he had a degree from Westminster College in Cochranville , Pa . He had-or so his papers indicated-taught in Newark , Del. , and he had testimonials from a John Wagner at Pennsylvania 's Lincoln University and from Professor Robert Hillyer of the University of Delaware . The board put him down as " slightly above average , " and when the 1955-56 term began , Henry Fordham found himself teaching mathematics in the Robert A. Taft High School . <P> His work was only passable , but the teacher-shy high school was delighted to have another math instructor . Fordham moved his family into a house in nearby Hamilton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westminster , landed a job in a Hamilton elementary school . For the Fordhams , the future seemed assured-until one day they applied for a small loan at the Household Finance Corp . <P> No Admittance . In the course of its routine investigation , the finance company wrote Westminster College in Cochran ville , Pa. to learn more about Fordham . Since there is no college of any sort at Cochranville , the letter ended up at the nearest Westminster , in New Wilmington , Pa . Yes , the college said , Henry Fordham had once applied for admission , " but we did n't admit him because of the poor quality of the work represented by his credits . " Fordham 's documents , complete with a most convincing seal , had nothing to do with that Westminster College . <P> From Newark , Del. , School Superintendent Wilmer E. Shue reported that Fordham " has never taught in our schools . " At Lincoln University , President Horace Mann Bond checked into the matter of the testimonial from John Wagner , declared that there was no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that name had ever been connected with the university . Professor Robert Hillyer of the University of Delaware , the Pulitzer Prize-winning poet , said that he had never heard of Henry Fordham . <P> Do It Yourself . Had the Cincinnati school system been dealing with any other sort of man , the case against Fordham might have ended there . But though found out , Fordham insisted that he had a legal right to his full year 's pay . His Westminster documents , he added , were not really forgeries , for he himself had created the college with seat at Cochranville , Pa. , and , had given himself and his wife degrees . To back up his argument , Fordham turned to the dictionary , where a college is defined as " a collection , body , or society of persons engaged in common pursuits . " He , his wife and three children , said Fordham , were obviously just that . <P> Last week the state board of education was planning proceedings to revoke the certificates of both Henry and his wife . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of their salaries . From a legal point of view , it seemed , it was just barely possible that a college could indeed be defined as a collection , body , or society of Fordhams " engaged in common pursuits .
