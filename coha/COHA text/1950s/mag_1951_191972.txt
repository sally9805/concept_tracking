Are syndicated newspaper columnists worth printing ? Before the American Society of Newspaper Editors in Washington last week , editors and columnists jumped into the ring to answer the question . Editor J. Donald Ferguson of the highly successful Milwaukee Journal ( circ. 324 , - 268 ) , who booted out all canned columns years ago , threw the first punch . <P> " Frankly , " said he , " I think the syndicated column is one of the biggest rackets ever put over on editors . . . We would n't trade one experienced reporter for all the syndicated columnists we could crowd on the editorial page of the Milwaukee Journal . " Any enterprising editor can get better facts and opinion from his own staff , he said , if he spends a little money to send them off to the spots where news is breaking . " A page of these syndicated columnists is a perfect reproduction of the yakety-yak that fills the room after the third or fourth dry Martini . " <P> Another trouble , said Ferguson , " is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150 editors . . . that he is endowed with prophetic powers ... If an editor throws him out ... or so much as changes a comma , the columnist immediately denounces him as trampling on the freedom of the press . " <P> Bell Syndicate 's Drew Pearson , introduced , in recognition of his libel docket , as " the only man . . . with more suits than Hart Schaffner &; Marx , " rolled with the attack . He realized , he said , that some " indefensible things " had been published by columnists , " and I myself have sinned . I 'd like to forget a number of things . " But alert columnists have kept the lid on graft , have " been able ... to give to newspapers some things which they would not otherwise get . " <P> But Pearson had a Sunday punch . The Milwaukee Journal itself , said he , knew all the facts in the celebrated case of White House Aide General Vaughan and the deepfreeze scandal ( TIME , July 4 , 1949 et seq. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it passed the story on to Congressmen to investigate . When Pearson picked up the trail in Washington , he risked libel and printed as much of the story as he could get . Said Pearson : " If Mr. Ferguson 's paper had published and not banned columns , they would have published the story of General Vaughan . " <P> Said Ferguson : " It is n't always because we 're afraid . We like to get all the facts before we print a story . " <P> The argument did not settle a question which deeply troubles the U.S. press . But it did throw a light into the heart of the matter . The columns , for all their faults , are good reader bait , and at their best , often give news and views that the mine-run newsman does not produce ; they will continue to be popular as long as editors rely on them for the work their staffs are unable to do . <P> <P> * Walter Winchell last week needled the Cincinnati Enquirer for disagreeing with him three years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editor Everett Boyd : " We 'll cut him or drop him any time we want to . We 're still running the Enquirer . . . We 've cut Pegler too , and he got mad at us . But he got over his mad . Winchell didn't. "
