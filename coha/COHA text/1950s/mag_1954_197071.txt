The U.S. Air Force , which has batted down many a flying-saucer report , has long wished ( in private ) that it could build one . By last week , the Air Force was prepared to invest heavily to make hallucination come true . Air Force men have inspected a Canadian mockup saucer , approved a more advanced design , and hope within three years to have a prototype that can take off straight up , hover in midair , and fly at mach 2.5 nearly 2,000 m.p.h. at sea level . Its designer : John C. M. Frost , 35 , a tall , shy Briton with a passion for flowers and flying saucers . <P> The Coanda Effect . Frost , who lives in Toronto with his wife and son , helped to design wartime gliders , later the Vampire jet and DH-108 tailless jet . As chief design engineer for special projects at A.V. Roe Canada . Ltd. ( part of Britain 's famed Hawker-Siddeley aircraft group ) , he worked on Canada 's first home-built jet fighter , the CF-100 . Meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he designed flying saucers-at least one 40-ft. mockup , with a flattened end and spindly undercarriage . This model , quickly nicknamed he " Praying Mantis , " was designed to take off at a 40 angle after a short run . <P> But Frost wanted a vertical take-off-which is quite a trick . Even such a powerful jet engine as Pratt &; Whitney 's J-57 , with about 10,000 Ibs. of thrust , can barely lift its own weight vertically . After countless wind-tunnel tests , Frost finally found what he thinks is a solution in an aerodynamic principle known as " the Coanda effect . " <P> Rumanian-born Henri Coanda , 68 , a successful inventor who lives in Paris , designed a primitive turbine-engine plane in 1909 and a scale-model saucer in 1947 . But his great contribution to the art of making flying saucers was the principle he discovered in 1937 : curving one side of a nozzle will deflect a jet blast to follow the curved side . <P> The Russians Ahead ? Around the Coanda effect , Avro 's Frost created a startling design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a squat jet engine in the middle and a bubble cockpit perched above . From the engine 's 35 burner tubes blasts would radiate to 180 exhaust ports all around the saucer 's edge . To apply the Coanda effect the pilot needs some kind of movable control over one lip of each exhaust . To take off he would set these controls to deflect the blasts downward . The downblasts carry along with them more air from above the plane than from below it . This decreases air pressure on the top , causing the saucer to rise . <P> If he rises as he is supposed to , the pilot would then reset the exhaust controls for normal jet flight . He could fly in any direction by choosing the appropriate set of burners in his circular power plant . So that he would always be facing forward , the cockpit would rotate automatically as the craft changed direction . <P> Fantastic as Frost 's saucer sounds , it may not be the first . The USAF 's willingness to spend money on saucer-plane experiments results from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U.S. in this field .
