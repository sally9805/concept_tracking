I think , iii. : 11 is pretty intolerable too have someiew just assume you are simple a nil transparent when you know all the complicated things that are going on inside you But a lot of women do have that feeling about their husbands . We like to think we are the complicated ones , and this traditional concept of woman , the elusive , the mysterious . the unattainable sex , often makes me chuckle Maybe we are all that to men or maybe some of us are to ' , Milt men . But men arc a good deal more elusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taken the trouble to look under the surlace , and any woman who has n't is missing most of the fun of living with a man . One of the Inas ( ohne characteristics most attractive to women really is the eternal yell for freedom . nicely and often comically balanced by an almost equal yen for comfort , for security , for the kind of love which forges bonds , tint there all the same , stirring and twitching. as the most faithful dog will stir and twitch in sleep when he dreams of chasing rabbits . it is a relative thing . of course . Some men want to chase rabbits all the time . Some only occasionally . Some get enough sense of freedom out of dreaming about chasing But it is a fart which most students of consider axiomatic that no man is wholly sold on being married  --  not all the time . It is a wide-open question whether any woman wholly likes being married all the time either . Maybe every woman should lake a long look inside and then answer that question silently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly the urge to soar , the impulse to beat one 's wings now and then against the bars of life , is an endearing and useful human characteristic . And it is probably safe to say that most men have more desire for freedom than most women . Su what do wives do about the male urge to soar ? How do we keep our husbands content with being married to us  --  content , in fact , with being married at all ? I low do we keep them from feeling trapped ? For a man who feels really trapped is not only a had husband , he is also a had life-insurance risk . %Veil , it seems obvious that the best way to keep a man from feeling trapped is simply not to trap him . Not trapping a husband involves leaving him free to do his job in his own way and to enjoy the hobbies that fill up the chinks in his personality . It also involves letting him fed free to enjoy other people . These pages may make a good many women nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vices our culture has glorified is virtoes , possessiveness has probably been most glorified . Husbands and wives can be downright smug about their possessiveness , as if the extent of ownership were an accurate measure of love . 1 do n't know whether men or women arc more possessive . Most people would say men . But if men arc more possessive , which I question , women are certainly more smug about it . These arc common wifely remarks to which friends often nod approval : " My husband ca n't move a step without me . " " He would n't dare do that without asking me . " " I 'd scratch his eyes out if he looked at another woman . " The popular notion that a good husband is his wile 's property and a good wife keeps her fences well mended should shock us a great deal more than it seems to , for what is possessiveness , when you get right down to it , but a desire to own someone , and what is owning someone but slavery ? " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger , wives to husbands , and children , sometimes , to parents . No matter who says it or under what circumstances , it is always true . No human being ever owns any other human bring . No matter what their relationship , no matter what legal , religious or emotional tics hold them to each other , they do not possess each orlicr I can not help commenting hereon the old-fashioned use of the verb " to possess " as a euphemism for sexual intercourse usually by a man with an unwilling woman , as if the act itself made her his . The old Biblical writers had a truer sense of values when they used the verb " to know . " People should not even want to possess each other . What is possessiveness based on , after all , but that craven and humiliating emotion , fear  --  fear that if we let our husbands out of our sight they wo n't come back ; fear they 'll have so much fun with their friends they 'll hate the thought of coining home ; fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their love for us will evaporate . This kind of fear , humiliating enough in itself , also reveals a humiliating lack of self-esteem . 1Vhat in the world is a possessive wife afraid of ? Marriage is a strong and sturdy institution . In spite of the divorce rate , most people like being married and stay married . Nlost people know that getting unmarried , is an unhappyexperience which is destructive to everyone . Men may dream of freedom . but they want to be happy more than they want io be free , and keeping a close eye on your husband is not exactly the best way to keep him happy . The funny papers have a way of putting the finger on contemporary social problems  --  and I wonder if that is why people say . see you in the funny paper " ?

Lots of husbands have such a good time with their %soca that they would rather go anywhere with them than without them , which is obviously the nicest possible way for a husband to feel , but it 's a good het that the wises of these ever-losing husbands arc not possessive women . is a good bet that , once at the comention , these husbands feel free to have a drink with their friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are nut like Dagwood , who has to ask Blondoe 's permission to Play poker . knowing that , more than likely , she 'll say . - No . " Why does n't Dagwood just go play poker anaway ? I often wonder . The fact that he does n't worries me . That song everybody was singing a few years ago . Do n't Fence Me In , was n't so popular just because it had a good tune . Men atrophy if they feel fenced tn . They need to know that if they want to go play poker with the boys or spend Saturday golfing or go lishing over a weekend , it is quite all right with their wives . Quite often the freer they feel to do man-things. the less they will want to . But they all need to feel free and most of them need occasional jaunts that are eacluswels male . It is easy to give them this if we know they need it so as to feel free , not just to get away from us . A great many women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get off with men friends still fall completely to pieces if the poor men show the slightest interest in any other women . These wives , I suspect , may be the ones responsible for that dreary contemporary phenomenon , the sexually segregated dinner party . Es cry evening , in suburban circles all over the , . . pt I t ( Continued from Page 331 country , husbands and wives get dressed and go out to dinner with other husbands and wises , The wises take great pains to look as pretty as pomible . They urge their husbands to look as well groomed and As dashing as possible . Then unit at the party , the wives talk to the wises and the husbands talk to the husbands all caenmg . Why do they do 11 ? Parties arc certainly not planned to be an extension of the office and the shopping expedition to the chain store . Yet , over and over again . that is the way they turn out . It seems possible to me that men have got in the habit of talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really prefer men talk as because they are afraid to talk to the women . They are afraid that if they seem to he having fun with any other woman . their wives sill he jealous and gist them a bad time after they get home . And this dreary situation becomes a vicious circle because all the women who would like to talk to men at parties arc also afraid of the jealous possessive wives . The minute they find themsches enjoying someone else 's busband they begin to feel nervous , So everyone plays safe and is bored and uncomfortable because 01 that great looming shadow of possessiveness , and everyone might as well have stayed home , for all the change and relaxation anyone gets . I know of a wife who one evening watched her husband gel deep in comersation with an attractive girl he had just met . After a short time , unable to bear it , she went over and joined them , and began telling the girl all about their children , which , not surprisingly , broke up the conversation . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . " That girl  --  was she awfully interesting ? " He shrugged . " Nothing special ; she was fun , " " But there is n't really any other woman you 'd rather talk to than me , is there ? " she persisted . At which point , her long-suffering husband had had it , and answered , " Frankly , my dear , hundreds , " It is a sad little story , for most likely that particular possessive wife simply sulked and decided her husband did n't lose her , and most likely that particular husband was a little slower to talk to an attractive girl at the next party . Yet the most fascinating woman in the world must realize , if she stops to think , that her conversation can be fascinating to her husband only if he has something to compare it with . What are panics for if not to charge your batteries so that each of you will bring something new home to the other ? ran into a lovely example of this when we stopped at a roadside restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited on us was so radiant that we could n't help commenting on it , " We really lived it up last night . " she said . " We danced , a whole gang of us , till three in the morning . My husband and I , " she grinned , " hardly danced together all closing after the first dance . There was one fellow who did a terrific samba , and all the girls were after him . " " What did your husband do while sou were sambaing ? " I asked . and she looked at meat if I 'd said something stupid . " 1-k was dancing with all the other girls , " she said . " He was having a real ball . " " What time did you have 10 come to work this morning ? " I asked . " Oh , nine , " she shrugged . " hut , you know , you just live from Saturday night to Saturday night . You do n't feel tired if you 've been having a good time . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she probably is . What makes other attractive women so frightening to the average wife ? Their charm does n't make the wife any less charming . and if a husband appreciates charm wherever he finds it , he is only showing he has good taste . A wife ca n't seriously think her husband may lease her because he talks to another woman . Marriages are not broken up that easily . I am even inclined to think that the myth of the home wrecker is just exactly that  --  a myth . I do n't believe any woman can break up a home that IS really happy ; When a marriage breaks up  --  even if another woman is involved ? . the other woman was a result , not a cause . The marriage really broke up because the husband and wife did n't understand each other and love each other enough . And one of the very best ways to keep on kwing each other is to feel free to have a good time with other people , I know a woman whose husband is a born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiringly user some other woman . " How do you stand it ? " a well-meaning friend asked the wife . " Does n't it make you jealous ? " " Why ? " she smiled . " He always goes home with me . " I r a husband and wife each come home from a party feeling attractive , they are bound to bring home a heightened awareness of how lucky they arc to live in a world where men and women can have fun together and transfer this awareness directly to each nther . It miry sound somewhat extreme to say that flirting at parties can strengthen Use bonds of marriage , but it can indeed , and sery often does . Husbands and wives need to see . now and then . how they look to other people . What a man says to you at a parts or what a woman says to sour husband helps each of you to find out your good points . It not only helps you feel attractive . it actually ' helps you be more attractive . Marriage too often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbands the more danger there is that we may make the cage smaller and smaller in our efforts to be close to them . There is a good deal 01-inevitable routine to marriage . We often feel . after a few years , that our husbands have come to live with us out of nothing but habit.:Well , husbands are just as likely to feel that their wives live with them out of habit . Every man needs to feel like a dominant , conquering , auras:toe man , and his wife ought to feel grateful to every woman who makes him feel that way , Every year a man grows older , what is more , he needs more acutely to be reassured about his charm . Women often get so wrapped up in their own fear of growing old that it never occurs to them their husbands may have the same fear . Men in their forties and fifties especially are apt to be literally haunted by the fear that any day now they may be finished as males . Yet even more than with women . the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hormonal . So anything which makes a man feel young and vital will actually tend io make him be young and vital . A woman who finds her forty- or fifty-year-old husband jitterbugging with a twenty-year-old , instead of saying acidly , " Do n't be an old fool , " ought to say  --  and feel too ? " Now there 's a kid who knows a man when she sees one . " Men vary as much in their need for freedom and conquest as they do in everything else , but just about all men want feminine attention , even if they are too shy to go out and demand it . I have known a woman to say to a charming friend right before her husband , " Tom is all tired out tonight and needs your soothing feminine influence . " And Tom beamed and the friend preened her feathers and sat right down and began to entertain Tom . Other husbands will have more 70 barnyard rooster in them . They 'll have to feel dominant and conquering , like that man who was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say comfortably , always goes home with me . " And some husbands  --  let 's face it  --  tease a good deal of tomcat in them . I am afraid Ise have to recognue that men differ in this way . It does no good to say of a man with tomcat tendencies : He should n't be that way , it 's wrong . The fact is he is that way . He probably ca n't help it . It may be a neurotic drise to prose himself , and you may be able to help him feel faseinating enough without looking for more reassurance in other women than es good for your marriage . You may be able to talk it out with him gently . But the chances arc you wo n't he able to change him much . If you can believe that he loses you in spite of this , and accept him stub undemanding , you may give him the security he needs to live with you to a happy old age . You may even , in the long run . get more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than you ever could if you tried to make him over . A very wise . lender woman I know has been married for a long time to an equally tender . if perhaps not so wise , man . l le is a passionate and Intense person , a. oh an almost insatiable need to reach out and prose himself in work . in play and , as it turned out , in love too . Soon after they were married , she found he was going to fall for other women from time to time . At first she thought she could n't stand it , and told him so frankly . Frankness. especially in this sort of thing . does n't always work , but ii worked speciaeularly for these two . He was just as frank . " You 're my real true love , " he said . " You always will be , but  --  and I ca n't es-plain it  --  these other wonderful girls give mc something else I just have to base to Do n't try to take it away from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to take anything away from you . " It is a 4 ; unous contrast to the all-toocommon , work-dominated husbands who arc not able to give their woes or an-body else misfiling . This man gate his wife more than most men ever do , but he could do it only by giving part of himself to other women . When someone once asked his wife how she put up with him , she smiled a warm and loving and oddly contented smile . " I suppose he 's a heel , " she said wonderingly . " but he 's sigh a magnificent heel . I could n't clip his wings . I think it stould kill him . " To say this extreme of letting a man he himself would n't work for most people is putting it mildly . Few marriages could survive such a pattern . Few wives could be this accepting of their husbands ' unconventional  --  and possibly neurotic  --  emotional needs . Many would say no wife should be this accepting . let this particular marriage . which would hate withered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wings , incredibly throve and grew stronger every year on the warmth and understanding and freedom they gave each other . During the last war , while the husband was away . the wife , not surprisingly . fell in love with another man and was prepared to get a divorce . But when she wrote and told her husband , he fought like a tiger to get lease to come home and Ste her . " You ca n't leave mc , " he said indignantly . " We 're married for better or worse . " " There have always been other women in your life . " she reminded him . " Ah , but I never thought of leaving you , " he argued . " I have never in ms life told another woman I loved her . " An absurd but somehow charming distinc tion which actually does have in it some of the basic stuff good marriages are made of . Fortunately for American wives , most husbands do not beat their wings as hard as all this . Most men are like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep in telling one of the women how fascinating he found her , smiled and said , " Do n't worn . I know by now you ca n't have your cake and eat it too . " Most men are going io he co in tent with acceptable o a:id ! wing-beating. but we must gist them that freedom if we want them to gross mellow and health ) as the sears go on . If our husbands like to make a fuss oscr other women at parties and we have decided it is good for them , what are we going to do at those parties ? It all depends on the sort of women we arc . We may hate just as much need to feel fascinating as they have . and we certainly have just as much nght to it . But it is n't essential to any marriage that a wife be a fe Male and try to compete with the prettiest girl in the room just to show she 's still got it . Offhand , I can think of at least use solid marriages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though the husbands have an obvious weakness for the seductive appnlch . All these wives arc charming and warm and losing . They are amused and relayed at their husbands ' lose of glamour . Maybe their husbands wish they would dress up more and turn on more charm  --  I do n't know ? hut most women want to look fascinating and sins because it makes them feel fascinating and sins , and I suspect these women are so sure of themselves and their husbands ' lose they have no need for overt glamour . I suspect these women do their ministering on a hundred different levels which make glamour unnecessary , and giving their husbands freedom to enjoy glamour where they find it Isom sine more facet of the ministering . Arc they ever jealous ' ! I do n't know . If they arc , they handle it , for it never shows . Flow can the rest of us handle our jealousy ? Well , lint of all , Ste can accept it as normal , but stop priding ourselves on it . It is normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jealousy is never a sign of lose : it is frankly a sign of hate . You hate the other woman  --  or it may be a man your hits . band is talking to , or a dog he is making a fuss titer . You hate whatever you are jealous of because it makes you feel deprived and inadequate . Women can be just as jealous of their husbands ' hobbies as of another woman . I know one wife who had taken a good look at all the things she was jealous of and admitted once , with a ears smile , that she was most jealous of her husband 's pipe . Real jealousy , however , like possessiveness , simply means you do n't trust yourself , and just taking that good look at it can often make it go away . Ask yourself , II ' hut mu I icalonA of ? Do 1 reulls thmk he Ides that n onion , or man , or dog , or hobby , or pipe better than he likes nor ? If this does n't make you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base to say to yourself , So truhnis. ! do n't have m thaw it . can simply lire with it . like a headache , till it goes away .

You may have to grit your tect and say to yourself , 1 can he better Ma ' his , and f bore to he . Jealousy will deur ? a lot near than my husband and my ma riage .

Even men who lose talking to other women often red if they find their wises absorbed other men . And jealousy is as had for man 's health as it is for his marriage . It can raise his blood pressure . It can up . his digestion and be a strain on his heart . So what should a wife do who has a jealous possessoc husband ? Should she take great pains never to smile at another man , in hopes of keeping her husband happy ? Well , almost certainly not , for almost certainly it wo n't keep him happy , since jealousy , once started , can feed on imaginary food . A really jealous husband will imagine his wife is smiling at of - men esen of she is n't . Probably the first step toward helping a jealous husband be more relaxed is to learn to understand his jealousy just as you might learn to understand your own . Realize he is jealous because he feels insecure .

Making more fuss over a jealous husband will do hint fur more good than never making a fuss over any other man . If that does n't seem to help , talk about it . " It bothered you to we me dancing with Jim Zilch , did n't it ? But %shy , , darling ? Men like me and I like them , and you love me because I 'm that sort of girl . But after all I chose you . I 'm yours . " Coping with jealousy in yourself or your husband takes time . It is n't easy , . ' but the effort pays off in a freedom which paradoxically can only bring you closer together . Some women may actually have to fight for their right to be themselves at parties , and if they do base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for their husbands ' sakes as for their own . Trying to placate a possessise husband is just a form of slavish submissiveness which is almost bound to make a woman hostile inside and may also end by tying her possessisc husband up in a web of anxiety and guilt . But we all hate to be careful that we are genuinely being ourselves and not tool unconsciously trying to make our husbands jealous . A wife who plays this little game may tell herself she is just trying to show him how she feels when he makes her jealous , but the chances are she is really testing to find out how much he loses her . It is n't a very good or reliable test , and it can be a very destructive one , as any deliberate cruelty is always destructite .
