txt TOKYO , Feb. ** Koreans fed up with communism have formed guerrilla bands with South Korean irregulars and have been carrying out a hit-and-run war behind the Communist lines in North Korea for the last twelve months . The United Nations Command permitted disclosure today of some details of the raids that have been disrupting the Communist forces and helping to prevent the Chinese and North Korean troops from mounting any new mass offensives , Sizable units organized along military lines , in addition to numerous roving groups not organized militarily , have been harassing the Communists , who like to broadcast over the Peiping and Pyongyang radios that the North Koreans are solidly behind the " People 's Government . " Guerrilla bands in North Korea , to put it most guardedly , are doing at least as much damage to the enemy as Communist raiders have been try-1 ing to do in South Korea . 1 Striking from the sea and cross ing by land , weaving their tiny Isampans through harbor minefields or crawling cautiously along rice paddy dikes , these well-armed teams have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convoys and raided enemy-occupied villages . It has cost lives and injuries . The risk of torture in case of capture is so great that each guerrilla usually saves the last bullet for himself . But the enemy has been forced to divert many badly needed troops in an attempt to ward off sudden guerrilla strikes . Ten months ago , a few weeks after the guerrillas had begun to operate behind the Communist lines , this correspondent persuaded a team to take him along on one of its forays and to allow him to talk with its chief , who was operating in Red-held hills on the outskirts // of a city that was , and still is , a Communist stronghold . For reasons of security , an account of that trip was held up Until today by the Supreme Command . This trip gives an idea of how the guerrillas still are operating against the Communists . We made the first direct contact with the guerrillas from the pagoda roof of an abandoned cottage in a small fishing village on a frierely shore . Our code name was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guerrilla crouched on the roof , word went across the wide stretch of water toward the enemy shore that the ' " rains have come . " An hour later , from the South Koreans in Communist territory came the answer that the coast Was clear . Our party , five in number , jumped into a high-prowed sampan , rifles on gunwales ready to fire and grenades checked in halters . Five fishermen heaved their giant oars . It was a hard pull of several hours , one of which was spent in a giant whirlpool . Sometimes three men were on one oar . Once , we stood still close to the enemy shore while enemy mines , planted two nights before , Ware cleared away . A moving shadow on the wet cliffs sharpened into the figure of a silent guerrilla , a Sduth Korean flag draped on the barrel of his rifle . Without a word the guerrilla party hurried-inland , hugging the rice dikes and tree clus- , ters for protection . A rendezvous in a fair-sized village was arranged . Men , women and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routines , although most of the buildings , around the square had been abana doned . The biggest building was a , former bank , or post office . In the , teller 's cage and the vault space , behind it the guerrilla chiefs and lieutenants sat down to thrash out the scheduled operations . This correspondent had smashed his spectacles in a scramble across the rocks and the broken glass had cut his eye . Word had been passed on ahead and a medical-aid man was waiting in the building with a well-stocked kit to give first aid . This group of guerrillas numbered several hundred and was led by a former major of the North Korean Army , who had been a professor and who had gotten his fill of communism . With his lieutenants , he studied a detailed map of the area , using the muzzle of his pistol to trace the expected enemy traffic out of a near-by city that served as a supply point for the Communist army . On the previous night this band had ambushed a twenty-vehicle convoy , killed several drivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The scene in the bank vault resembled a cloak-and-dagger thriller . The guerrillas wore bandoliers of bullets strung across their chests . Some sported brilliant-hued scarves . Their armament , most of it wrested from the foe , included Chinese and Japanese rifles , Russian pistols . Their leader was proud of his Russian binoculars . Among those in the conference were two youngsters , 12 and 14 . One carried a Russian tommy gun : He was a kind of mascot and was proud of his three " kills " with the gun . The parley over , the guerrilla chief explained that timing was the secret of effective guerrilla operations . He said the Reds had an efficient spy system and probably had spotted him in the village , where he first made arrangements to cross into Red territory . I , But , he added , it would be several hours before word could be , passed to the Communist cornMand , by which time " we would be in and out again , and the best they could do would be to check up on what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in laying an ambush " At the time of this visit behind the Communist lines , General of the Army Douglas just had been relieved of his command . I stopped several townsfolk and asked what they thought of it . Not a single person had ever heard of General . Even among the guerrillas only the chief recognized the name . Foe 's Spying Effective The enemy 's espionage was working well that day . While we were eating a solid meal of chicken stew , eggs , vegetable soup , rice , wine and tea in one of the farmhouses  --  the guerrillas pay for all the food they eat  --  two lieutenants dashed in with the warning that a company of North Korean troops had been sighted hurrying around lour flanks to cut us off from our waiting boat . The meal was left half-eaten as the guerrilla chief buckled on his pistol belt and we rushed into the ( courtyard . Orders went out fast , and in less than four minutes every guerrilla seemed to have vanished . Only the original party of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wide intervals and headed across the paddy fields toward the coast at a fast walk . The ' chief explained that it would be impossible for a white man to hide in Korean villages , and that it was necessary to make a dash for the boat . It was night again and the blackness gave some comfort . The guerrilla leader warned us to drop at any sound or movement on the way to the coast . His men were alert but unfrightened . They seemed willing to get into a scrap . A guerrilla sentry suddenly rose from a hole in the ground and flashed his torch ; the chief cracked him across the face and , kicked at the light . The leader told a quick story why it was necessary to beat the Reds to the boat . Ten days ago , . another small party of guerrillas had used the same route and had gotten into a fight on the way out . This time , however , we beat the North Korean pursuit . There was only scattered outpost fire , and we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a square-sailed junk  --  and return to friendly shores . One of the guerrilla parties was in action that night as we pulled away from the rocks . On the horizon behind us there was a sudden flare-up from the Communist stronghold , a target of repeated guerrilla forays . Even at that distance , the flash of the firing was reflected on the sail , which bellied out in the night wind . The clicking of the bamboo stays on the junk 's mast seemed much too loud .
