Owner of the restaurant : Socony Mobil Oil Co. , which installed a cafeteria and seven dining rooms in its Manhattan headquarters to give 2,400 employees bargain food at a sizable loss to itself every month . Operated by the Brass Rail Restaurant ( on a cost-plus fee basis ) , the dining rooms are graded according to rank , with white-collar workers in one room , various executive echelons in the others . All rooms are air-conditioned , have piped-in music , and are pleasantly decorated ( some in rosewood paneling , one with a pigskin leather floor ) .
