Nearly two years after the drastic devaluation of the peso ( TIME , April 26 , 1954 ) , Mexico 's economy looked handsome and husky . Last week the Nacional Financiera ( a government financial corporation similar to the U.S. Reconstruction Finance Corporation ) reported that private investment rose a huge 40% in 1955 and is expected to increase again in 1956 . Some other signs of the good times : <P> The trade deficit was cut from $163 million in 1954 to $118.7 million in 1955 ; at the end of 1955 there was a $66.7 million surplus on international payments , compared to a $41.1 million deficit in 1954 . <P> Overall production rose 10% in 1955 . Production of cotton , the nation 's No. i export commodity , rose 15% , with a bumper 2,000,000 bales . <P> With the nation 's dollar reserves at an alltime high of $410 million , the government submitted a record $528 million budget for 1956 with full confidence that it will be balanced for the second year in a row . <P> Although two good crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom , it would have been impossible without a revival of confidence in Mexican business circles . Chief architect of the confidence has been hardheaded Treasury Secretary Antonio Carrillo Flores , whose policy of reduced government intervention in business slowed down and then reversed the flight of capital that resulted from post-devaluation jitters in 1954 . Nobody knows better than Economist Carrillo Flores that there are still bad spots in the Mexican economy . Antiquated labor laws hamper development of the textile industry , for example , and Mexican agriculture is still too dependent on cotton . <P> Despite these danger signals , Carrillo Flores is confident that if the government does not impose further controls to stifle business growth , the economy will develop its own counter-inflationary forces . The latest reports suggest that he is right : in the last quarter of the year , the cost-of-living index and wholesale prices were held to a modest 1% rise .
