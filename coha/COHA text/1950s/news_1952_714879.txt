txt The Iranian public is being given to understand that the presence in the country of W. Alton Jones , president of the Cities Service Oil Company , may lead to the final defeat of the AngloIranian Oil Company in its conflict with the Iranian Government , and that Mr. Jones is primarily interested in having his American concern take over operation of the nationalized industry and distribute and sell its production . Statements to the contrary issued by the company in the United States receive very secondary consideration . In London , British diplomatic observers and oil . experts were inclined to optimism as a result of statements that Mr. Jones was in Iran more as an observer and adviser than as a business man , and that he was not seeking to take financial advantage of Britain 's dispute with Iran . Mr. Jones left Teheran early today for Abadan , having successfully avoided newspaper men . It was learned authoritatively that he had hoped to get away without having his presence here known to the London press . *Under the heading " Oil War Assumes.New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers , stated : . " If there is an agreement between the Iranian Government and the Jones mission , the Cities Service Company Will administer , Abadan-:refinery and Oil insallations on behalf of the Iranian Government . In effect , the Cities Service  --  Company will be an agent of Iran and will receive renumeration from oil revenues for its services . " " An intense rivalry may start soon between the Cities Service Company and the former Anglo Iranian Oil Company and their affiliateg , ! the paper continued . " The - Cities-  Service Company , which thus far has confined its operations to the United States and Mexico , may try to enter the European , Far East and Southeast Asia markets and thus the oil war may assume a new form . " Bakhtar Emruz , organ of Premier Mohammed Mossadegh 's National4Front stated : " Mr. Jones ' arrival here will have important repercussions on American foreign policy in regard to Iran . According to our reports the company has promised the Premier that if Iran is ready the company can operate the Abadan refinery with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch , and make arrangements for the distribution of oil in international markets . " The company has the means , such as tankers , and also the power to distribute oil . " Anglo-Iranian Setback Seen Emphasizing that the result of an agreement would be defeat of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and Britain , the paper stated : " In political circles the arrival of the mission , although said to be without prior knowledge of the State Department , is an outstanding instance of continued friction between the United States and Britain . Should the Cities Service Company assume the responsibility for resuming oil operations with the consent of the Iranian Government it must be conceded that the United States has at last been convinced that it can not have any agreement with Britain on Iran and prefers to adopt an independent course . " The paper did mention , however , the possibility that an agreement might be reached by which the American company would operate the oil industry here and undertake to meet British oil needs and provide compensation . The Cities Service Company declined . to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday , however , Burl S. Watson , executive vice president I of the company , declared that " Cities Service has no financial or other interests in the Middle East " and that Mr. Jones ' only motive in discussing the oil situation ? with Iranian officials " would be a desire to make any contribution he could toward a solution of a difficult world problem . " The British Embassy here had prior knowledge of Mr. Jones ' visit through the United States Embassy , which itself apparently went to great pains to conceal the fact of the visit . Mr. Jones and his party visited today a part of the Abadan instal- , lations , according to reports from , Abadan . The Iranian oil crisis began in the spring of 1951 when Teheran ! nationalized the facilities of the ' Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and ' ordered the officials and British employes of the concern to leave Iran . Since the last British technician left the Anglo-Iranian oil installations in October , 1951 , Iran 's oil industry has been at a virtual standstill . ?   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
