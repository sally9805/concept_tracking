<P> When austerity-minded President Arturo Frondizi predicted last January that " a lowering of the standard of living is inevitable , " the warning could hardly be heard for the sounds of high living . Over street fires , outdoor laborers at noonday broiled tender chunks of marbled beef that cost 8 a pound ; white-collar workers lunched in restaurants on 17 beefsteaks so large they overlapped the dinner plates . Sundays brought an outdoor churrasco ( barbecue ) that began with meaty ravioli , went on to beef broiled over a pit fire . <P> Now Argentina , intent on curing its economic ills , needs to cut beef consumption and restore it to its historic role as a foreign-exchange earner . One day Amalia Ferrer , wife of an insurance-company employee , said to her butcher : " Carlos , two kilos of beefsteak . " Carlos cut the thick slices , said : " Seventysix pesos the equivalent of 19 a pound . " Seora Ferrer protested : " But Don Carlos , only last Friday I paid 60 . " Sighed the butcher : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; soon it will be more . " The housewife settled for stew beef . <P> Giving up Comforts . In less than six months , Frondizi 's austerity has turned from vague phrase into dinner-table reality . Headlined Noticias Grficas : DISASTER HITS ARGENTINE TABLE . " Commodities that were never missing from tables of the most modest homes , " the paper said , " are now fast disappearing , such as wine , butter and the classic Argentine barbecue . How far can a meager family income go ? " <P> Since January the Buenos Aires ' cost-of-living index has soared from 1,610 to 2,665 ( from a base of 100 in January 1943 ) . Se Ferrer finds bread up from 4 to 8 a kilo , eggs from 14 to 47 a dozen , vegetables and fruits trebled in price . Husband Vittorino , 38 , no longer goes noontimes to a restaurant ; instead , he takes a sandwich and a bottle of bouillon to work . He has even given up his cheap , locally made cigarettes . His paycheck is fixed at 5,200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange market ) , but everything Vittorino Ferrer buys costs more : electricity and transportation to the office , 130% ; phone service , 180% ; his morning La Prensa , 100% . Rent , which has been frozen since 1949 , remains the single stable item . <P> Getting Results . Frondizi 's plan to force Argentina to live within its means - by removing price subsidies from food , freeing foreign trade , freeing the artificially pegged peso to find its real level-has ended what used to be one of the most comfortable ways of life in the world . With prices rising , beef consumption is down 40% , capital district retail sales 60% , attendance at movies 20% , attendance at soccer games and horse races 25% . Even the rate of marriages has fallen 13% because of higher costs of setting up a household . The need for dollars to buy U.S. capital goods to raise production has depressed the peso , which hit an alltime low of no a dollar a fortnight ago before climbing back to 86 . But the encouragement to export , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first four months of 1959 , Argentina earned $102 million more than it spent abroad-its first favorable trade balance in five years .
