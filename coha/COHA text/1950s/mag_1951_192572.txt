IVOR NOVELLO ( 306 pp. ) - Peter Noble - British Book Centre ( $3 ) . <P> " One morning . . . a most important gentleman came to our front door carrying a huge big box from Queen Victoria . . . There was a letter on top written in gold ink . . . He was all dressed in a beautiful uniform of red , and had on a blue hat with a white feather . When Mamsie hurried to open the big box she found it was all lined with red , white and blue cotton wool , and there in the very middle was ME . " <P> While most of his contemporaries were still thinking of themselves as bundles dropped by a passing stork , little Ivor Novello had already and all by himself imagined , in this glamorous **31;7976;TOOLONG , his first theatrical production . <P> In later years , right up until his death last March , Novello produced box after box of fluffy entertainment for the British public-and there in the middle of almost every show was Ivor . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for a while her Jack Barrymore too ; added to which he was one of the most successful song writers of his day , and a maker of light comedies second only to Noel Coward . <P> Ivor Novello , a biography by Peter Noble , British theater historian , does full , sometimes fulsome , credit to its flamboyant subject , and tells a success story as pat as any Novello melodrama . <P> A Song for History . Ivor Novello Davies was born in Cardiff , Wales , the son of David Davies , an accountant , and Clara Davies , a singing teacher . Little Ivor was early set down as a prodigy , at least by his doting mother , because , she said , he cried in perfect thirds . Mother was impatient for promise to become performance . " Darling , " she reminded him all through his boyhood , " do you realize that if you died tomorrow , it would not make the slightest difference to the world ? " <P> Ivor turned to song writing in his teens and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that made him both rich and famous : Keep the Home Fires Burning . It caught the ear of the marching men , and they sang it into history as one of the most popular songs of all time-to the distinct discomfiture of Novello 's regular publisher , who rejected it . <P> Ivor was a national idol overnight . His delicately handsome profile , photographed in a thousand lights , became somehow confused in the public mind with a patriotic poster , and to lonely wives and mothers he became a romantic surrogate for the men away at war . The movies invited him into their realms of gold and in he went . <P> The Call of the Blood , when it was shown in 1920 , puffed Ivor into a fullblown matinee craze , and The Rat , a melodrama which Ivor wrote , produced and starred in , made him a leading figure on the stage as well . Glamorous Night , the first Novello musical ( in which he also starred ) , was a huge hit . The Dancing Years , his fourth musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he was through , all beautifully decorated and loaded with the brisk tunes and languid ballads that Britons had learned to expect of him .
