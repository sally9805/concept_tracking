When Harlow H. ( " Red " ) Curtice moved into the No. 2 spot at General Motors four years ago , he quipped : " You never stand still in this business . You either go up or down . " Last week Curtice , who has never gone any way but up , became G.M. 's acting president as Charles Erwin Wilson prepared to become President-elect Eisenhower 's Secretary of Defense ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . <P> <P> Curtice , now 59 and sure to be Wilson 's successor , has been with G.M. all his business life .

Within a year , he was AC 's comptroller , the youngest executive ( at 21 ) in the industry . He got a reputation as a comer who could " pitch , catch and cover first base at the same time . " He learned finance , production and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35 , he was named AC 's president . <P> Four years later , in 1933 , he got the tough job of curing the sick Buick division .

With his knowledge of design and sales , Curtice put out a new series that caught on immediately , doubled Buick 's sales in one year . <P> By 1936 , Buick 's production had quadrupled . From the Depression low of 41,000 units , Buick hit a prewar high of 377,000 , fourth place in the entire industry , right behind lower-priced Ford , Chevrolet and Plymouth . When he left Buick to become G.M. 's executive vice president , Red Curtice took over design , public relations , distribution , engineering , research , personnel , employee relations , procurement and real estate for the entire corporation . <P> Curtice lives in Flint , commutes the 67 miles to Detroit almost every weekday by company plane . A man with a genuine liking for people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G.M. executive . He drinks and smokes sparingly , relaxes on rare fishing and hunting trips . But like most of G.M. 's top brass , he has only two real hobbies : making automobiles and talking about them .
