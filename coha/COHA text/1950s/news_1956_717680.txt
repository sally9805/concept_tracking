txt A justice department investigation has been started on an alleged attempt to bribe Sen. Case R. , S. D. to influence his vote on A Case left and Rogers the pending natural gas bill , it was disclosed today . This announcement came after an earlier decision by senate Republican and Demo ? cratic leaders to request a special senate inquiry to determine if there was " attempted bribery " in a cash donation of $2,500 for Case 's campaign fund from a supporter of the legislation . Acting Atty . Gen. William P. Rogers announced : " In order to determine whether there has been a violation of federal laws , the federal bureau of investigation , at my request , has interviewed Sen. Francis Case regarding the matter he discussed in the senate yesterday . Senators Agree on Probe I have also requested the FBI to conduct such other investigations as may be necessary to enable the department of justice to make this determination . " The decision on a senate inquiry , also , was announced by Democratic Leader Johnson Tex. after conferring with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridges N. H. of the senate Republican policy committee a n d Democratic Whip Clements Ky . . Case 's disclosure to the senate yesterday of a $2,500 campaign contribution from an outsider interested in his support of the natural gas bill threw a bombshell into the otherwise . dull proceedings . Case said he ordered the money returned and has decided to vote against the measure , altho he previously favored it . Wo n't Make Name Public After the justice department announcement , Case indicated that he had furnished the man 's name to the FBI as " a responsible agency . " He said he had talked to two FBI agents at the FBI 's request . He still declined to make public the campaign donor 's name . The money was in twenty-five $100 bills left with a friend of Case in South Dakota , the senator said . Case later conferred with Knowland and Bridges but told reporters , " I 'm not going to give the name " to the senate on Monday . He said such disclosure would " serve no purpose " other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident . He said he would not object to Johnson 's motion and " under all circumstances , I welcome an investigation by any properly constituted authority or officials that have responsi-bility in such matters . " Case repeated his statement of yesterday that the contribution was " a revelation of the stake somebody thought they had in the fate of the bill . " He brushed aside the comment of Sen. Fulbright D. , Ark. , sponsor of the bill , that the timing of Case 's speech was " inexcusable , " . by saying he acted as soon as he could . Senators were admittedly in a serious dilemma , and some said the bribe charge may defeat the bill . which otherwise was expected to pass by a few votes . Ends Rate Regulation The measure would end utility-type regulation of rates ovdr producers of natural gas and authorize the f e der al power commission to determine only a " reasonable market price " for gas entering interstate pipelines . Supporters claim production of natural gas is a highly competitive business which cannot. be regulated like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased rates to consumers . Fulbright summed up the situation : " As it stands now , anyone who votes for this bill is now suspected of having received such a campaign contribution . " Another senator described the incident as a " last minute dead cat " thrown into the natural gas debate . Act on Inquiry Tomorrow Johnson said the senate will be requested to approve the special inquiry on Monday unless Case meanwhile provides full particulars on the campaign contribution and identifies the donor . Johnson proposed a select committee of two Republicans and two Democrats to conduct the inquiry . He said he will offer the mo tion when the senate meets Monday . It could be approved by unanimous consent . If blocked then , Johnson said he will make the proposal again after the gas bill is voted up or down . A single objection could not block action then . Johnson said he plans to go ahead with voting on the bill Monday , as previously agreed , altho there were some suggestions that action be postponed until Case 's charge is explored . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this matter reflects upon the integrity of the senate itself , " Johnson said in a statement . " Unless the issue is resolved , it will haunt the senate for years to come  --  beclouding the outcome of the vote . " Johnson , who favors passage of the gas bill , declared that " the man 's name should be made public and if any at-tempted bribery was involved . the case should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law . " He said Case was requested " 11 times " yesterday to reveal the man 's name , but refused to do so . " A member of the senate has reported a set of circumstances which raise the inference that an improper attempt was made to influence the vote on a pending issue , " John , son continued . " An allegation of such weight must be tracked down to the very end . " No allegation has been made that any senator has acted improperly , but it must be made clear to any misguided individual that the United States senate is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee would have powers similar to that which investigated censure charges against Sen.
