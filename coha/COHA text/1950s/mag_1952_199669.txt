The New York Port Authority this week dedicated the world 's biggest , most modern airport control tower . The new $1,000,000 structure , rising 150 ft. above New York 's International Airport at Idlewild , on the Atlantic Ocean side of Long Island , is packed with electronic equipment : six radarscopes , ' 13 radio receivers , two transmitters and connections to ten more ' transmitters spotted around the airport . It is also equipped with the newest wrinkle in radar control : the A.S.D.E. ( Airport Surface Detection Equipment ) , which looks not up but down , and displays on its broad scope a living , moving map of every detail on the huge field ( 4,900 acres ) . <P> On A.S.D.E. the runways show up as black bands outlined by radar reflections from the knee-high grass that grows on their margins . Airplanes moving along them are not mere shapeless blobs ; they are sharply defined bright bars , and experienced radarmen can even tell one type of plane from another . A car or truck shows up as a smaller rectangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a bright dot . Any obstacle on a runway , such as a misguided truck or a disabled airplane , is spotted at a glance . <P> With A.S.D.E. , the International tower will be able to follow planes right up to the unloading point , avoid the danger of collision on the ground . The only complaint so far is that the new radar is a little too sharp-sighted . Recently a truck was sent out to investigate what looked like a dangerous obstacle . It proved to be a fringe of grass that had poked up a few inches through a crack in a runway .
