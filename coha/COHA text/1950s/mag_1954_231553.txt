Of all the characters in the history of U.S. drama , Colonel Nimrod Wildfire of Kentucky occupies a special place . He claimed to be " half horse , half alligator and a touch of the airth-quake . " He had " the prettiest sister , fastest horse , and ugliest dog in the deestrict . " He could " tote a steam boat up the Mississippi and over the Alleghany mountains . " His father could " whip the best man in old Kaintuck , and I can whip my father . " All in all , the colonel was a wow back in the 1830s-the literary prototype of the tall-talking frontiersman , the first introduction to the stage of native Western humor . But what had happened to the play that first made him famous ? Until last week , most scholars could point to that as a U.S. literary mystery . <P> Only a Memory . From 19th century diaries and newspaper notices , and old playbills , the play has long been known about . Its author was Novelist James Kirke ( Westward Ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on by famed Actor-Producer James H. Hackett under the title The Lion of the West . For London , Hackett had it rewritten as The Kentuckian , or a Trip to New York , and in the nation 's capital its subtitle became A Trip to Washington . A hit for more than 20 years , the play was never published . After Paulding and Hackett died , the memory of their great creation , Nimrod Wildfire , remained ; the play was apparently lost . <P> Last week , as the result of some diligent sleuthing by Professor James N. Tidwell of San Diego State College , the Stanford University Press was able to show the public The Lion of the West for the first time . Tidwell began his search for it in 1947 simply because he thought it might contain the origin of the phrase " up the salt river , " meaning " to defeat a man politically . " He collected everything he could on Actor Hackett 's tours . He scoured the libraries of the Allegheny region , checked with rare-book dealers . Finally a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London , it must have received the permission of the Lord Chamberlain . Tidwell had the Lord Chamberlain 's files searched , at last found the clue he was looking for . The place that the play turned up : the British Museum , where it was listed under the name of the author whom Hackett hired to adapt it for the London stage . <P> Pure Farce . Modern readers will find that The Lion holds up remarkably well . Its plot is pure farce , involving a phony British nobleman 's quest for the hand of an American heiress , a social-climbing American mother , and a visiting English lady named Mrs. Wollope , who like Mrs. Trollope is collecting data on the domestic manners of the Americans . In the course of the play , Colonel Wildfire helps rout the phony nobleman-and Mrs. Wollope as well . Sample dialogue : <P> Mrs. Wollope : . . . May I offer you a cup of tea ? <P> Wildfire : Much objected to you , madam . I never raise the steam with hot water - always go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man of spirit ! Are you stationed in New York , sir ? <P> Wildfire : Stationed-yes ! But do n't mean to stop long . Old Kaintuck 's the spot . There the world 's made upon a large scale . <P> Mrs. Wollope : A region of superior cultivation-in what branch of science do its gentlemen excel ?
