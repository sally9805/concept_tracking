As machines get more complicated , quick-acting and violent , they are more prone to self-destruction if something goes wrong . Some nuclear reactors , for instance , can turn into radioactive junk in a fraction of a second . To avoid such misadventures , most modern mechanical and electronic systems are equipped with built-in monitors that watch their operation and shut them down promptly at the first sign of trouble . But if a vacuum tube or relay in the monitor fails , the main machine is like a building whose night watchman has dropped dead . Trouble can start and get out of hand with no one to correct it or give the alarm . <P> In Control Engineering , W. G. Rowell of Scully Signal Co. and A. B. Van Rennes of M.I.T. describe a method that they have invented for " watching the watchman . " The monitor as usual watches all operations of the machine , but when everything is going well , it does not merely sit back and give a " safe " signal . Instead it gives a rapid alternation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , proving that the monitor is alert and on the job , the machine will shut itself off . If any part of the machine fails ( including its readiness to shut itself off if the monitor fails ) , the wide-awake monitor steps in and stops everything . <P> Rowell and Van Rennes believe that this basic principle of " exercising " the monitor to prove that it is still alert can be applied to anything from airplane controls to chemical factories . It will not keep them from failing , but it should make them " fail safe , " even when the electronic watchman has died on the job .
