txt Warned in a report from its Committee on Foreign Affairs that " the present rulers of the U. S. S. R. are obviously dedicated to the destruction of the United States , " the House cleared the way today for action on a military and economic foreign aid authorization of $7 , - 848,750,000 in the 1952 fiscal year . Already cut in committee by $651,250,000 from the $8,500,000. - 000 requested by the Administration , the measure faces atttempts at further reductions when debate begins tomorrow . As it now stands , the bill would authorize $6,013,000,000 for planes , tanks , guns and other military equipment and $1,835,750,000 for economic and technical assistance . Meanwhile , the House passed today by a vote of 352 to 5 the $5,768,700,000 military construction bill . The measure , authorizing construction at bases at home and abroad , is the largest of its kind ever sent to Congress in peace or war . It was added by the Senate Democratic Policy Committee to its " must " list , Paving the way for an uphill fight for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed no possibility of diverting the men in the Kremlin from their intention to destroy America " except by building strength which they know they can not overpower . " Milriatidd iNifid Breakdown " In addition to the fear of which they as dictators are always conscious , that their people may become less docile if they are infected with the hope of obtaining their freedom , the Soviet leaders accept the philosophy that Communist states and capitalist nations can not exist together in peace , " the committee reported . The omnibus authorization bill was ordered brought to the House floor tomorrow after a lively session of the Rules Committee during which one member , Repre // sentative Clarence J. Brown , Republican of Ohio , announced that he was " damned tired " of being asked to approve legislation without knowing what it contained . He complained that while vast amounts of money would be authorized for expenditure in Western Europe and other areas , there was no way for a member to learn from the bill what countries would get how much . Representative James P. Rich ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Affairs group , told Mr. Brown that " frankly , we 're not in a position to make that public . " He did not say ' that military security prevented its disclosure , and Representative Walter H. Judd , Republican of Minnesota , said that recipient governments might accept any such " breakdown " of figures as final and object to any changes . Past authorizations of economic foreign aid have not stipulated what amounts were to go to specific countries under the Marshall Plan , but neither was there any secret about tentative allocations of funds . In another spirited outburst , Representative John E. Lyle Jr. , Democrat of Texas and a Rules Committeeman , demanded to know for what reason " that gang of nogood Russian hoodlums " was invited to take part in negotiation of the Japanese peace treaty . After Representative Brown remarked sarcastically that the Russians had been " our glorious allies , " Chairman Richards commented that he did not think much of the Russians either but had no power to exclude them from the Japanese peace talks . Representative Lyle also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool statements " by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India in attempting to advise this cbuntry on the Japanese peace treaty . He asserted that Mr. Nehru apparently wanted to give Formosa to the Chinese Communists . In the end , however , the Rules Committee sent the omnibus bill to the floor of the House with the understanding that it be debated one whole day and then read for amendment . The committee did not attempt to restrict the amending process . In its report to the House , the Foreign Affairs Committee said this country faced the choice of continuing heavy aid to its allies for several more years or running ' the risk of standing alone and being overwhelmed . It defended its paring of both military and economic aid funds on the ground that not all of the money proposed by the Administration would be needed within a year . The committee also denied coiltons that a proposed new independent agency with its single administrator to carry out the Mutual Security Program would relegate the Secretary of State to a subordinate position . It said the measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter . The report spoke of a series of defense plans that were outlined to the committee in secret session and " which should deter Soviet aggression or defeat it if launched . " It spoke optimistically of the outcome of any war with Russia but cautioned that it would take time for American industrial might to reach its maximum and that , in any case , such a war would be long . In justification of its conclusion that the time probably available to the allied powers before a Russian attack warranted the proposed program , the committee reported : " 1 . Russia apparently fears our superiority in atomic warfare . The-Russian Army is ready and could get into action in a short time . It could undoubtedly overrun a considerable territory under present conditions . Nevertheless , the Soviet Government has to take into account the likelihood that the destruction of their major cities and industries would occur immediately . Furthermore , their lines of communication with Western Europe would run through peoples increasingly restless and hostile . " 2 . Russia respects and fears our industrial potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Russia . Nevertheless , the United States would be stronger two years hence than now and any war would be a long war . World War II was a severe blow to the Russian economy and the drain on her resources of maintaining such a large military establishment is onerous . " In a Senate address , meanwhile , Senator Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. , Republican of Massachusetts , sought to protect the Administration 's program against reductions when it reached that body . He said any substantial cut in the authorization requested would be undercutting General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower , Supreme Allied Commander in Europe , and quoted his Chief of Staff , Gen. Alfred M. Gruenther , to the same effect . Senator Lodge said the rearming of Western Germany was a key point in General Eisenhower 's program for the defense of Western Europe . He quoted General Gruenther as telling him in an interview recently : " We are convinced that there is no realistic defense of Western Europe , including Western Germany , without some form of German participation . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a divided Europe . " The presence of the bereitschaften a near-military force in the Eastern zone of Germany under Soviet control , backed by the Soviet satellite forces , presents a threat to the external security of Western Germany , which should be countered by the creation of German forces .
