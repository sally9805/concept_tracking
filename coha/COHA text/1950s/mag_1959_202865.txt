The first and best of American still-life painters was honored with his first one-man show , 134 years after his death in 1825 . The exhibition , at Manhattan 's Knoedler Galleries this week , afforded a 38-picture survey of Raphaelle Peale , the troubled son of a great father . <P> In an introduction to the catalogue , Historian Charles Coleman Sellers notes that Peale 's paintings " are of our own time more truly than of his . They have a peculiarly modern appeal in their very personal motivation and in their use of realism as an escape from reality . That other painters regarded still life as fit only for school work or amateurs may have encouraged him to take it as his own , to develop it with his wonderful virtuosity and to find in it a little province of personal supremacy , of surprises and satisfactions , of no money value but of solace and always of escape . The world in which he moved from place to place so laughingly had not been kind to Raphaelle Peale . " <P> Charles Willson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same expansive spirit as his good friend Thomas Jefferson . He raised his children to be geniuses , saw them more or less painfully sink to the level of ordinary men and women . Young Raphaelle found solace , as he sank , in parlor games , ventriloquism , a pretty shrew of a wife , his art , and the bottle . He turned restlessly to science . He patented a preservative for ships ' timbers and a system for heating houses , developed a " new theory of the universe " which attributed the movement of astral bodies in space to electrical attractions and repulsions . He was an immensely likable lush , and a wizard at the easel . But his pictures never sold well . They lacked extravagance and high polish ; for all but the quietest of dining rooms they spoke too softly of small delights . At the end , his wife was forced to take in boarders to support the family . As his last job before he died at 51 , Raphaelle Peale was reduced to writing " lovesick poems " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been bred within this painter , " says Sellers , " a call to the lofty and obscure and an artist 's sensitive pride . He had seen from within himself what held the sun and stars and planets in their courses , but could not find his way and purposes among the nearer things . He had to have , somewhere in the world , a place of perfection of his own , though it should be only the little one of laughter , of surprise , only the illusion of fruit upon a table rich with the juices of summer .
