Blowing directly into the mouth of a person who has stopped breathing is the oldest method of artificial respiration known to man ( and akin to the oldest technique of real respiration : the Lord 's wafting life into Adam 's nostrils ) . But distaste for touching a moribund victim has brought numerous alternatives , from rolling a man over a barrel to the Nielsen " back-pressure , arm-lift " method , which last year superseded the Schafer " prone-pressure " system in the manual of the American Red Cross ( TIME , Oct. 7 ) . <P> The newest method goes straight back to the oldest . Among the growing number of researchers who contend that nothing beats wafting breath with the lungs is a group from Baltimore City Hospitals and the universities of Maryland and Buffalo . They measured the exact volume of air that each method forced into the lungs of 16 volunteers , all anesthetized and paralyzed with a shot of a compound resembling curare . Summarizing 27 such experiments in the current New England Journal of Medicine , the researchers found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nielsen methods under field conditions could move enough air into a victim to maintain adequate oxygenation of his blood . Reason : a rescuer 's hands are not free to keep the victim 's chin up and ensure free air passage through his throat . <P> Completely successful by contrast was the mouth-to-mouth method , in which the victim is placed on his back , mouth cleared of all foreign matter , while the rescuer leans down from the side . The rescuer raises the chin of the patient with one hand , forcing open the jaw with his thumb , holds the nose with his other hand . He then blows hard and fast , inflating the victim 's lungs , stops when the chest rises so that the lungs can automatically deflate . The cycle is repeated at a rate of 20 inflations per minute until revival . For even more efficient operation ( and to spare the finicky rescuer from intimate contact with more messy victims such as drunks ) , a rubber blowpipe with an S curve has been devised to fit the throat , prevent air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who tried the tube for the first time , say the researchers , none failed to revive his victim . Conclusion : all lifeguards , policemen , firemen and other official rescuers should carry such a pocket-size tube .
