A slight Englishman with penetrating eyes and close-cropped , greying hair is hard at work this week lecturing and conducting a retreat at Hobart College in Geneva , N.Y . Few of Hobart 's students have ever before seen anything quite like Dom Gregory Dix . For one thing , he is a monk of the Benedictine order in the Church of England. * For another , he is a scholar who began specializing in military diplomacy and became one of the world 's leading experts on Christian liturgy . <P> Beautiful Fossil . At 23 Gregory Dix became a history don at Oxford , but after a couple of years the job began to bore him . When a friend told him that missionary teachers were needed to train African natives in the ministry , he volunteered . After three years , desperately ill of dysentery , he returned , " leaving a large part of my insides in Africa , " to face what seemed bound to be like a life of invalidism . He decided to devote his life to studying the origins of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now prior of Nashdom Abbey in Buckinghamshire . His 764-page Shape of the Liturgy won him an international reputation . <P> A persuasive , lucid speaker , Dom Gregory is lecturing on the primitive church at Hobart , as he will at numerous other U.S. universities and Episcopalian centers during the next six months . Wherever there is time for him to train assistants , he will also conduct a demonstration of the Mass as it was performed in approximately 200 A.D. Such Dix demonstrations aim to make Communion meaningful to Christians for whom it has been a beautiful but meaningless fossil of antique forms . <P> Ordinary People . At his demonstration Mass , Dom Gregory explains the primitive Communion as it was celebrated by a bishop , deacons , priests and congregation . Each member brought his own piece of bread and small portion of wine . The bishop and priests then consecrated all the bread and wine . At the end , the congregation filed by and took Communion under both forms , saving some of the bread to carry home so that they could take Communion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last Supper , " says Dom Gregory , " Jesus was performing the ordinary Jewish method of saying grace . He performed the usual four actions before supper and the usual three actions after . He took the bread , blessed it , broke it and gave it ; He took the cup of wine , blessed it and passed it around . But at this last supper , He told those with Him to do this accustomed thing with a slightly new meaning-'This is My Body which is for you . Do this for the recalling of me . ' <P> " This is the basic structure of the Eucharist . . . None of the devotional exercises which seem such an important part of our service were there . The congregation and priests of those days were perfectly ordinary people-they were n't picturesque-who slipped in secret through the streets in the early morning . Each brought a piece of bread and some wine ... <P> " Each individual offered himself-as Christ had offered Himself-and in Communion the individual got back his own life transformed into the life of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Church of England .
