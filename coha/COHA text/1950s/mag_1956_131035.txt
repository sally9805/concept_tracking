A few years ago , a tough competitor named James J. Nance deserted the electrical-appliance business to join the varsity of American industry in Detroit . He had n't been in the motor capital long when , understandably awed , he made a shrewd observation . " This is the most important business in the country , " said Nance , now president of Studebaker-Packard Corporation , " but for all its super-salesmanship , engineering know-how and manufacturing genius , it depends on the same kind of fickleness my wife shows when she buys a hat . " // Motordom 's fortunes , indeed , are geared to customer caprice . At the annual model change , Detroit 's yearly salute to planned obsolescence , the carmakers unveil their latest steel , glass , rubber , chrome and plastic creations with fantastic fanfare . A car is built to run well for years , but even before the customer 's proud grin of new ownership can evaporate , the industry toils to make him dissatisfied all over again . // Before Pearl Harbor , Detroit generally restricted its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the newest four-wheeled editions . But these days , the industry ca n't resist the delight of getting ahead of itself . Instead of keeping the cars of the future in their secret back rooms , auto men , wise to the ways of mass appetite whetting , now let the car-buying public in on their exciting plans . // The teasing news is spread by the experimental or idea vehicle , popularly known as the dream car . These dazzling futuristic buggies are crowd magnets in scores of auto shows , like General Motors ' multimillion-dollar Motorama which opens in Los Angeles March 3 for a nine-day run . They also are seen in big city dealer exhibitions , state fairs and in less ambitious traveling displays which often wind up in individual retail showrooms . Mercury division of the Ford Motor Company expects 2 million people to see its XM-Turnpike Cruiser ( opposite page ) , which early this month , after a number of auto show exhibitions , starts out on a seven-month , 15,000-mile coast-to-coast junket . It will be displayed in a $50,000 " Van-O-Rama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on either side . // Dream cars , outside of their obvious sales promotional and public relations value ( showmanship-conscious auto men say they would be worth the investment on this score alone ) , have accomplished many things . Not the least of these is to boost the morale of the automotive stylist , a relative newcomer to prominence in an industry long dominated by engineers , production experts , financial wizards and master salesmen . // Virgil M. Exner , the slim , silver-haired director of styling for Chrysler Corporation who is credited with the design that sparked Chrysler 's dramatic 1955 comeback , stresses this " inspirational value " to his staff . Exner also points out that having a futuristic car that can actually be seen , touched and even driven , not only conditions the public to expect progress but has " educational importance " in the stylist 's dealings with top management . // George W. Walker , the breezy , luxury-loving Ford vice-president in charge of styling , bubbles over with ideas , after permitting his visitors to recover from the shock of walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire floor of his otherwise nearly pure-white office . " Experimental cars , " says he , " are libraries for hot ideas . It 's important to have cars made up full-size so our people can see them in true perspective . Remember , a lot of the lowness we 're all after has to be a visual effect , because I do n't figure people ever are going to be willing to lie on their stomachs to drive a car . " // General Motors , which pioneered the dream car parade with its famed " Y Job " in 1938 ( it had fender extensions over the doors , electrically actuated convertible top and door windows , tail lamps recessed in rear fenders ) , emphasized the opportunity afforded by its experimental models to sample public opinion in advance of production . As Harley J. Earl , GM 's burly vice-president in charge of styling , put it : " There was a time when we in General Motors styling felt we had to hold back on some of our design ideas because the public was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars about the nation , however , we learned that the public 's thinking in automobile design was ahead of ours , not behind . More than 2 million persons see our experimental cars each year in the Motorama alone . They talk about them , they say what they like  --  and what they do n't like . And we listen , very carefully . " // Just how carefully GM listens is demonstrated by the 15 research specialists from its customer research department which this giant of the industry sends out to each Motorama showing . These experts conduct about 2,500 ten-minute interviews on dream cars in each city , forwarding the answer sheets each day directly to Detroit . // Serious as auto makers are about obtaining the public 's opinions , it ca n't honestly be said that the public designs the car of the future . But the dream car helps because , primarily , the customer 's power over styling is a negative one . The average motorist ca n't design an automobile , but he can apply a mighty veto , to which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear mute testimony . // " We do n't try to push the public , " says Ford 's Mr. Walker wisely , " we try to lead them . " // Ideally , an auto company likes to have about 36 months in which to give birth to a new automobile , from drawing board conception to production line . But the average period of gestation usually is a little more than two years . The industry , slowly but certainly , is heading for a two-year , rather than the usual three-year , model change-over , and the intervening facelifts  --  unless the law of supply and demand is repealed  --  will tend to become major ones , not mere lipstick jobs . Because the nation 's shortage of tool-and die-making facilities forces years-ahead planning for these changes , the current crop of dream cars reveals many features already undergoing tooling for actual production . // Exner says public reaction to most dream cars comes too late to alter " areas of major tooling already under way when the idea-car is shown . " But response to comfort features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate application to an upcoming production model , he says . // The Chrysler stylist , a former Studebaker man , says his company has a different idea-car approach . " Every car we 've built has been runnable and produceable , with one exception , " he says . " We do n't believe in the Buck Rogerish , splash type dream car . Our way of doing it has limited us in some ways , but we think it 's more practical even though our models cost more than the mock-up , pure show car . " // Chrysler , until recent years the most conservative car builder in the industry , may well be credited with the inadvertent creation of the first real modern-age dream car  --  the Chrysler and DeSoto Airflow . The Airflow popped out , in depression 1934 , on an unsuspecting public accustomed to shoe-box verve in its new car looks . The Airflow , sadly , was a commercial flop , far too radical for a country which likes careful evolution , not revolution , in its new automobiles . But it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the fenders , hood and radiator grille becoming nearly a single component . The trouble with the Airflow was that it was a production car too soon . It should have been a dream car first . // With a few notable exceptions ( Studebaker and Kaiser are prime examples ) the early postwar period was a time of major engineering rather than major styling advances . Automatic transmissions , high compression V-8 engines , power brakes and power steering were the talked-about features . But Cadillac 's then-controversial tail fins were making automotive news , and in 1951 GM 's LeSabre became one of the most influential experimental vehicles , heralding the panoramic windshield three years before it became a reality on 1954 GM production cars . The svelte LeSabre also had pronounced tail fins well before most of the industry started selling upswept rear ends . // Chevrolet 's Corvette was first shown as a dream car in 1953 and response was so favorable it was rushed into production . Ford 's Thunderbird never really was a dream car in the Corvette sense , but Ford did show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The purpose was not to sample public reaction , of course , but to steal sales from the Corvette . Cadillac is returning the favor by displaying its snazzy Brougham months before production so that would-be Continental buyers will have something to ponder . Chrysler still declines to enter this type of big league ploy contest , preferring to offer souped-up versions of its standard cars , like the Chrysler 300-B , to the high-performance fans . // Although styling has been the big noise in the array of experimental show cars , engineering has not been ignored , particularly in GM 's two Firebirds powered by gas turbine engines , which represent the next really major mechanical advance in automobiles . If metallurgical problems can be licked ( the big headache : not enough heat-resistant metals for volume output ) , Detroit will be ready to produce gas turbines for cars in five years . One way or another , you should be able to buy one in 10 years . // It is common knowledge that the 1957 models , due next fall , will mean another far-sweeping switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1956 dream cars reveals many clues about what Detroit has in store for the motorist . Among other features : a general lowering of cars , with eventual roof cutouts for easy access , and some startling rear-end treatments , including rear fenders that flare outward at a sharp angle . // " These so-called dream cars , " says George Walker , " are n't as futuristic as they look . Stick around for a year or two and we 'll prove it . "
