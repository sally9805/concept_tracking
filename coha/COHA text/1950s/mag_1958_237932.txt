Back in 1928 . Kansas City Chemist J. C. Patrick stirred up a gummy mess of sulphur , carbon and hydrogen in an attempt to find a better , cheaper antifreeze . What he got was not antifreeze but one of the first types of synthetic rubber . He named it Thiokol ( after the Greek for sulphur and glue ) , and with friends formed Thiokol Chemical Corp . As a rubbermaker , Thiokol did not go very far saleswise ( one reason : it smelled so foul that it was dubbed " synthetic halitosis " ) . But since the age of space , the company has rocketed because Thiokol is a chief component in most solid rocket fuels . Thiokol powered the second , third and fourth stages of Explorer I and III into orbit , supplies the propellant for a whole family of missiles . This week word leaked that Thiokol is the hottest candidate for the whopping contracts to produce the propulsion systems for the Army 's Pershing missile ( TIME , April 7 ) and the Air Force 's Bomarc , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thiokol sales have gone from $4,800,000 in 1951 to last year 's $31 million , which brought net profits of $1,452,000 ( but still far behind the $162 million sales of its chief competitor . General Tire &; Rubber Co. ' s Aerojet-General Corp . ) . Though Thiokol 's first-quarter sales are off a bit because some of its military contracts ran out and one plant was damaged by fire , Thiokol expects a 50% gain for all of calendar 1958 . Reason : solid fuels are far simpler and safer to handle than liquid fuels that require a maze of tanks , valves and pumps , and they show the greatest promise for powering missiles until the atom-powered engine comes along . <P> " We 'd Like to Try . " Thiokol got into missiles in the same way the rubber was invented-by accident . Its researchers had found a way to process solid Thiokol into a liquid , and during World War II the armed services used it as a sealant for aircraft-carrier decks , pipelines , and the wing tanks of planes ( the average commercial plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then in 1946 Caltech 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , working on a radically new solid rocket fuel , tried mixing an oxidizing agent with rubber . But it had trouble combining the oxidizer with solid rubber , tried liquid Thiokol by happenstance ( a Shell Oil Co. salesman recommended it to a Jet Propulsion lab technician ) . When Thiokol 's management found out what was going on , it decided to try producing Thiokol-based solid fuels . <P> President Joseph William Crosby , 61. a greying , jowly hustler who had joined the company as a salesman in 1936 and became boss in 1944 , " started ringing every Army doorbell we could find in Washington . We told them what we had , that we did n't know anything about rockets , but we 'd like to try . ' '
