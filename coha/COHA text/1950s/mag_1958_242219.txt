( See Cover ) <P> Where did you come from , baby dear ? <P> Out of the everywhere into the here . <P> Where did you get those eyes so blue ? <P> Out of the sky as I came through . <P> - George MacDonald <P> The origin of baby dear , and the reasons for " eyes so blue " are the concern of genetics , the comparatively young , fast-developing science of heredity that is trying to solve the mystery of life , as physics works at solving the mystery of matter . Genetics has already accounted scientifically for blue eyes ( even in a strictly dark-eyed family ) . It is working toward an explanation of how the first life appeared on earth . It is offering knowledge that may lead to the cure of cancer . And it came along just in time to warn against misuse of another young science : nuclear physics . The comparative " cleanness " ( low fallout ) of the test bombs that the U.S. was exploding in the Pacific last week was in large part a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young is the modern science of genetics that some of its grand old men are still alive , and some who gave it form are still only middleaged . Outstanding among them : Professor George Wells Beadle of Caltech , who did most to put modern genetics on its chemical basis . Geneticist Beadle is a mere 54 . In his working lifetime he has seen genetics grow from a small , rather baffled specialty into a central , exciting science that is drawing the rapt attention of chemists , physicists , mathematicians , even astronomers , as well as nearly every type of biologist . <P> Monk &; Peas . Genetics got its recognizable start , along with relativity , quantum theory and nuclear physics , during the scientific revolution of the early 1900s , but it had a strange , unpublicized start more than 40 years earlier when Gregor Mendel , an Augustinian monk and natural-history teacher in Brnn ( now Brno , Czechoslovakia ) , began experimenting with peas in the monastery garden . Mendel found that the parent plants transmitted their characteristics to their descendants in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , are crossed with white-flowered ones , all the seeds grow into plants with red flowers . But when these red hybrid plants are crossed with each other , one-fourth of their offspring bear white flowers . <P> Mendel concluded that the reproductive cells of peas contain factors ( now called genes ) of two kinds : dominant and recessive . The gene for red-floweredness is dominant ; the gene for white-floweredness is recessive . When red-and white-flowered plants are mated , the seeds produced get both genes , but the dominant red gene suppresses the recessive white gene . Result : red flowers in the first generation ( see diagram ) . <P> The white-flowered gene , though suppressed , is still in existence . When red hybrid flowers are mated together , each seed in the second generation has a one-in-four chance of inheriting nothing but white-flowered genes . It will then bear white flowers , just as if its parents were of pure , white-flowered stock. * The other three-fourths of the seeds will bear red flowers .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
