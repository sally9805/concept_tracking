( See Cover ) <P> In mid-October 1954 , the U.S. political scene is a multicolored landscape of issues and personalities , with the commanding figure of Dwight D. Eisenhower giving a national shading to the whole picture . The color and design of the campaign vary from state to state , but within the narrow borders of New Jersey there is a striking miniature of the national scene . At work there are nearly all the factors that bear on the elections of 1954 , highlighted by Jersey 's own style of politics . <P> In a sense , New Jersey is a Democratic state : it is heavily industrialized , has a substantial organized labor vote . In another sense , it is an Eisenhower Republican state : its suburban areas lying outside New York City and Philadelphia are populated largely by commuters-business and professional men . It has its McCarthy element , centered squarely in Democratic Hudson County ( Jersey City ) , where Frank ( " I Am the Law " ) Hague ( now retired ) built his machine . In recent years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although it is well-supplied with reformers . <P> While this complex set of circumstances is affecting the whole campaign in New Jersey , it is wound tightest around Clifford Case Jr. , a gaunt ( 6 ft , 158 Ibs. ) , intense , intelligent lawyer from Rahway ( pop . 21,000 ) , who is the Republican nominee for U.S. Senator . <P> Noisy Backfire . Carefully hand-picked as the candidate by G.O.P. leaders , Clifford Case , an Eisenhower Republican , nevertheless ran into trouble not long after the campaign began . A small , reactionary G.O.P. faction began trying to force Case off the ballot on the grounds that he was 1 ) a weak candidate , and 2 ) not a Republican . Led by James P. Selvage , a onetime ( 1933-38 ) pressagent for the National Association of Manufacturers , the anti-Case faction contended that the nominee was a dangerous left-winger , the darling of the C.I.O. and of the Americans for Democratic Action . <P> The movement reached its peak in a jingle attacking both Case and Democratic Senatorial Candidate Charles Howell . Sung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular relish by the fiery-eyed , thin-lipped women who belong to an organization called Pro-America ) , the ditty went : <P> A , D , A ; A , D , A. <P> They made them run . They made them run . <P> First they nominate Clifford Case , Then they throw Howell in the race . A , D , A ; A , D , A . . . <P> Have you ever seen such a race as this ? You can only vote for two socialists . . . A , D , A ... <P> In writing their lyrics , the anti-Case faction ignored the fact that the New Jersey A.D.A . ( which has found both Case and Howell " endorsable " ) , is a minuscule organization with no real political strength . But to the ultraconservative element of New Jersey , it was a handy bad word to tie to Cliff Case . From the start , the movement had no chance of getting Case off the ballot . No important leader of New Jersey Republicanism ever joined it . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hartley ( Taft-Hartley ) , but no one thought has-been Hartley would get many votes .
