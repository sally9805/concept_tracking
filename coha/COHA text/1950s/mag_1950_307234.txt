The Reds launched a nuisance offensive against Western Germany . For several days &; nights last week , some 30,000 Red agitators and members of Red youth organizations had been crossing from East Germany into the Western zones . Many carried forged documents showing they were " refugees . " Their task : to stage " blitz rallies " against the Western powers in West German cities , cause disorder , confusion and fear . The expense accounts of these Red traveling salesmen , reported Socialist Kurt Schumacher , were met from the proceeds of a vast coffee black market operated by the Russians in their occupation zone . <P> West Germany proved ready for the invasion . <P> As soon as the Reds ' plans became clear , border guards were reinforced to prevent further crossings . West Germany 's police force of about 100,000 was issued carbines , tear-gas bombs and steel helmets , got busy building roadblocks on the approaches to target cities , notably Hamburg , Cologne , Dsseldorf , Dortmund , Essen . Policemen careened through the streets , sirens screaming , arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British called their Fourth Guards Brigade back from maneuvers to stand by for disorders in the Ruhr . <P> In the face of this show of force-and dampened by driving rain-the Reds ' day of " National Resistance " collapsed . There were minor riots in most West German cities , but all were quickly dispersed . At Munich , 300 Red agitators tangled with five policemen at the city 's famed October festival at which 50,000 Germans had gathered to drink beer . Promptly , 200 German riot squadsmen rushed to the scene , arrested seven Communists-and everyone went back to his beer . That was the pattern in most of Western Germany . Police tirelessly quenched " peace bonfires , " confiscated leaflets and arrested another 1,000 Communists . In Dsseldorf , a few days before , the British had requisitioned the Communists ' brand-new , $500,000 headquarters building to house British troops ; when the Reds refused to move out , British troopers and German police moved in and took over the building in a room-to-room battle ( see cut ) . <P> The Communists were more successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noisy demonstration before they were stopped by police . Sixteen policemen were injured . <P> The young West German republic had made a heartening display of nerve . Like their " Youth Rally " in Berlin last Whitsun , the Communists ' " resistance day " was a sodden fizzle.
