For the man in Flint or Fresno who dreams of some day loading the wife and kids in the family sedan and steering a few weeks later across the big swinging bridge over the Panama Canal , prospects looked a little brighter last week . Rolling up its maps in Mexico City at the end of one of its occasional meetings , the directing committee of the Pan American Highway Congress released information showing that only 6% of the 3,200-mile Laredo-to-Panama stretch is still missing . Work is going ahead on two of the three main gaps , and Vice President Richard Nixon has called for a new U.S. effort to get the road done . The country-by-country rundown : <P> Guatemala has the most frustrating gap . Mexico 's fine paved stretch of the highway reaches the border at a different point from where Guatemala 's road net touches the Mexican border . At present a 164-mile , $35 railway-flatcar haul bridges the gap . With $1,425,000 granted last October by the U.S. Bureau of Public Roads , construction is getting started to connect the loose ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlos Castillo Armas with public works , backs a speedup ( with $20 million to $30 million in U.S. aid ) that will quickly close the gap and pave the rest of the highway-now mostly gravel-through that country . <P> Tiny El Salvador takes the traveler through rich coffee land on paved roads , and he crosses Honduras ' corridor to the Pacific on good gravel . Nicaragua 's part of the highway , looping here and there to touch at the various ranches of President Anastasio ( " Tacho " ) Somoza , is mostly macadam . <P> Costa Rica stops the driver at the border with a seven-mile gap near the scene of January 's revolutionary fighting , but work now going on should open this stretch to traffic by May 1 . At the other end of the Costa Rican sector , after a breathtaking mountain drive offering glimpses of two oceans , the highway dwindles into nothing more than 134 miles of lines on a surveyor 's map . Current construction : nil . <P> Panama , where a determined tourist can pick up the road after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the canal . Beyond lies the forbidding Darien country-400 miles of lofty jungles , wide rivers and spiny mountains not yet even surveyed . <P> The Darien breach is probably a job for another generation . But Nixon guessed that even closing the Central American gaps would take 15 to 25 years at the present rate . The speedup he recommended to Washington will-he hopes-finish the road to Panama in four years .
