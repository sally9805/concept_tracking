In these leveling times when British professional men clip their own boxwood and their wives push their own prams , London exhibits no district more decorous and decorative than St. John 's Wood . But in Queen Victoria 's gilded reign a century ago , this first of the city 's garden suburbs had another reputation . Then noble Britons liked to steal away from their confining Mayfair mansions and visit leafy little hideaways in St. John 's Wood . There George IV and Napoleon III kept their well-hidden mistresses ; beauteous Lily Langtry waited for Edward VII at 20 Wellington Road ; many less famous women lived in well-kept seclusion with nothing to do but listen for the diurnal rumble of their lovers ' carriage wheels as their carriages turned into the gravel drives . When Novelist George Eliot , famed for her indifference to marriage vows , went to live there , the Countess of Cork snapped : " Of course , poor dear . Where else could she go ? " <P> With a mixture of incredulity and nostalgic delight , Britons learned last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liaison of Edwardian style right into the welfare-state era . In a London court , one Jacqueline Gray , a 41-year-old onetime model , sued 81-year-old Sir Strati Ralli , Bt. ( family motto : " Keep to the straight path " ) for the return of jewelry worth $34,000 . Miss Gray charged that Sir Strati had taken the jewelry from her to have it insured , and had refused to return it . <P> Sheepishly , Sir Strati told the court that he had kept Jacqueline as his mistress for 16 years , tucking her away in an $84,000 Georgian house in St. John 's Wood , with her mother as chaperone . When he called ( always at noontime ) , Jacqueline sent her mother to the movies . Three years ago he found himself " getting a bit frail " and tried to break off the liaison . Jacqueline objected ; there were telephone calls , and a somewhat ruffled Sir Strati had to confess to his wife to prevent Jacqueline 's turning up while a birthday party for his grandchildren was in progress . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why should I ? I never visited her in the evening , and you do n't wear jewelry like that in the daytime . " The judge was sympathetic : " An allowance of 40 a week taxfree , with other bills paid , " he observed , " does not sound like a very mean allowance for the casual interviews they had . Miss Gray received 38,000 over the years , a fortune in itself . " <P> The jury not only ruled for Sir Strati , but , applying the newfangled idea of equal rights for women before the law in an oldfangled way , callously ordered Sir Strati 's ex-mistress to pay costs .
