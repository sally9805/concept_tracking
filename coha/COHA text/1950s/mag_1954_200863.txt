( See Cover ) <P> Into a large , cluttered Detroit studio one day 18 months ago strode a trim , lean man with the suave good looks of an ambassador and the cheery smile of a salesman . Around the room were barrels of clay and modeling tools ; on the walls were blueprints of cars yet to be born . Only a handful of people were allowed in the room ; few even knew its location . On a platform in the center stood the reason for the tight security . There for inspection by Harlow H. ( " Red " ) Curtice , president of General Motors Corp. , was the topmost secret of the greatest manufacturing corporation in the world-a full-sized , blue-and-ivory clay model of the Chevrolet for 1955 . <P> Red Curtice had followed the progress of the new Chevrolet from first sketches to drafting board to quarter-scale model to clay mockup with all the anxious looks a young father-to-be bestows upon his wife . Now he slowly circled the car , squinting at its lines and lightly touching its smooth surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the molding of the trunk , he shook his head . " That 's not good , " said Curtice . " You 'll see that it casts a shadow on the bottom half of the lid . That shadow makes the car look higher and narrower . What we want is a lower automobile that looks wider . " At the side of the car , Curtice stopped again . Why should the belt line ( i.e. , the line formed by the bottom of the windows ) be straight and unbroken ? When a designer explained that only the two-door models would have a racy dip in the belt line , Curtice suggested : " Do n't you think we might try it on a four-door type , too ? " As he left the room , molders set to work making the suggested changes . A few days later , Red Curtice was back to see the results . Said he : " That 's it ! " Those two words were the signal for G.M. 's Chevrolet division to spend some $300 million to turn the clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a new model in auto history . <P> The Opening Gun . The new Chevrolet - the first all-new model for 1955-was the opening gun in the 1955 battle of Detroit . For Chevvy 1955 will be a year of decision . This year Ford led Chevvy in sales for the first six months , and for the first time since 1935 stands a good chance to beat it out for the year . With his 1955 models , Red Curtice hopes to put Chevvy solidly ahead again . <P> For the entire auto industry , 1955 will also be a year of decision . The fight to sell cars will be the roughest in history . To get ready for it , the automen have spent $1.3 billion on the greatest number of model changes ever . Not only are Ford and Chevvy at each other 's throats , but Chrysler is out to get back the big share of the market that it lost to both of them this year . And for the smaller companies , 1955 may well answer a life-or-death question : Can they compete with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merge into a new giant ? <P> No matter who comes out on top , the consumer will benefit in the best free-enterprising tradition .
