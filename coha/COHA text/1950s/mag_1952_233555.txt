Gardner Cox , 46 , is a talented Massachusetts painter with a happy outlook and a common-sensical approach to art that New Englanders can admire . To earn a living , he paints commission portraits of famous figures and Boston 's citizens ; the rest of his time he spends experimenting with abstractions and searching for new ways to express himself . At Cape Cod 's new Mayo Hill Galleries last week , people got a chance to see how the portraiture and experiments had turned out . <P> It was hard to say which were more successful . Though there were only a few oil portraits in the show ( Cox has done such celebrities as Harvard President James B. Conant , Judge Learned Hand , Dean Acheson ) , it was plain that he is no mere bread &; butter portraitist . The pictures had a carefree , almost dashed-off look : lots of lively colors , some swift lines brushed in with a spare and sure touch . What they lacked in detail was made up in warmth and spontaneity . In a painting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party dress , Cox had added off to one side a quick sketch of her playing in the buff which deftly caught the uninhibited side of three-year-olds . Even in a portrait , says Cox , " you 're trying for something universal . " <P> The idea of universality pushes out most strongly in Cox 's abstractions . He paints what he calls " basics , " e.g. , canvases combining such forms as rocks and eggs , which offer contrast in texture . ( " Eggs , " he says , " have a softness and smoothness and at the same time a nervous feeling . " ) He is also fond of beach still lifes , in which he tries for harmonies of color , e.g. , the whites of clamshells , the browns of crabs . Each is an experiment in style and technique . In a painting called Dew , he set pastel droplets on a gauzelike spiderweb ; in another , he suspended a flowering atomic symbol over an enormous egg standing on an infinite plain . New England approves of Cox 's experiments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary art , has a Cox " basic , " and several pieces in his current exhibit have already been spoken for . <P> Last week Gardner Cox himself was hidden away on an island off the Maine coast , busy with portraits and abstractions , recording trials &; errors in his journal . His wife and four children were with him , and , when their father could pry them away from the sailboat races , they sat for more portraits . Fee : 60 an hour , with deductions of a cent a minute for wriggling .
