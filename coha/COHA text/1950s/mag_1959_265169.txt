It was the work of Efrem Zimbalist , onetime concert violinist and now head of Philadelphia 's Curtis Institute , who had given Kapell the score to study . For a time after the crash , Composer Zimbalist had no heart to return to the concerto , but eventually he rewrote it from memory .

Said he : " It will not take a long time now . This work will be admired at first and later loved . "
