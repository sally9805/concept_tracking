the snow plastering itself against our faces with a force that numbed us , but the snow was mixed with spindrift , so that it seemed twice as cold as anything could be . " Go to the left , " I told Swede . " I 'll go to the right . Chips can walk straight ahead . Let 's leave Neal here to shout to us in case we 're lost . Leave Chips 's hammer with Neal , too , so Chips wo n't lose it when he falls . Hunt for trees or bushes  --  any kind of shelter . Anything  --  anything at all . Even an old shed , or a pigpen , or an overhanging ledge . Or a fence or a clump of thick grass . Or a hill . If you can find a hill , we can get in its lee . That would be better than nothing . " We blundered off into the thick , roaring dark . The tumultuous sea seemed to thunder from every direction . The footing , in that darkness , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low irregular ledges , all slippery with a half-inch coat of ice . Rocks turned beneath my feet ; spilled me into pockets between them . The pockets had razor-like crushed seashellsat their bottoms . The naked rocks were worse than the seaweed-covered ones on which we had landed , for when I fell I had the feeling that a leg or an arm must break . These rocks , I thought , must lead to some sort of beach , or a marsh , or a field . Instead of that , my groping hands again felt seaweed . Either the coast had turned , or I had become confused and turned myself . I bore more sharply to the left , to escape that damnable seaweed that was even more slippery than ice , though more cushiony . After all this exertion , this fever of activity , this terror of the pelting snow and flying foam  --  yes , and of the un/ending menacing crashing of the sea  --  my mouth and throat were like leather . In desperation I chipped ice from one of the boulders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the faintest trace of saltiness . While I stood there , chipping more ice and crunching it to bits , I heard a thin piping ahead  --  a faint wailing or squeaking , dim amid all the uproar of the breakers . It might have been a sea bird : it might have been the screakingof one rock driven by a breaker against another . I held my breath and listened  --  and heard it again : a faint call . I crawled even more to my left , feeling for boulders , cutting my hands on barnacles , skirting ledges ; easing myselfhead first to the tops of rocks : then lowering myself feet first on the far side . On thus mounting a ledge I found myself looking down into a black cavity in which there was noise and movement and from which , as I balanced there , burst a desperate bellow , a prolonged " Hull000 ! " from many voices . " I 'm Whitworth , " I shouted into that black void . I heard Langman 's voice . " Whitworth makes nine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where 's Swede ? Where 's Chips ? Where 's Cooky Sipper ? " " I know where Neal is , " I said . " I 'll get him . I sent Swede to the left to hunt shelter when we got above highwatermark . I sent Chips straight out . " " Shout , " Langman said . " One , two , three : Hull0000 ! " I joined in their shout with all my heart and strength , realizing horribly , as I did so , that the faint sound I had heard a few short minutes before had been the concerted bellowing of eight men , yet that outcry had carried onlyp82a matter of ten paces because of the wailing of the northeasterand the terrifying unending noise of that savage ocean . There was a clatter and a cry of pain from the dark hollow . I heard Captain Dean 's voice . " I 've got Cooky Sipper ! How many 's here ? " " Nine , " Langman said . " Eleven with you and Cooky . " Swede 's voice came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind . " I 'm twelve . I 've lost my bearings ! Where 's the boy ? " " Thank God , " the captain said . " The boy 's back there a rod and a half . He said Whitworth told him to stay . He would n't come along with me . " I shouted to Swede that I 'd get him , and went lurching off into the teeth of the storm . The going seemed easier when I had a known goal . Maybe I 'd learned how to handlemyself more skillfully on those ice-covered rocks and ledges . As I went I called Neal 's name , and when at length I heard him answer , I had the first moment of mental peace I 'd had since Captain Dean brought down the loggerhead on Christopher Langman 's skull . When I reached him he sank to his knees and huddled down into himself . " I have n't moved , " he said . I could hardly understand his words , his voice was so shaken with cold . They came from him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Cooky , " he said . " The captain lost his coat . He cut his hands on the rocks . Where 's my father ? " " He 'll be all right , " I said . I hoped to God I was tellingp83the truth . " Everybody 's safe in a hole in the rocks . We 'll go there now . " " Did anybody find a house ? " Neal asked . Shudderingly he added , " Place to get warm ? " I did n't have the heart to answer . " You 'll have to crawl , Neal , " I said . " You 'll fall if you do n't . The rocks are icy . If you 're thirsty you can eat the ice . " He still held Chips 's hammer . I took it from him and with it pounded ice from a boulder . It came off in curved slabs about an inch thick . We bit into them as into slices of solid frosted bread . I could hear Neal crunch the ice . H. would stop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crunching again . When we got to the depression where Langman , CaptainDean and the other ten were huddled , I knocked more ice from a boulder and brought the slabs into the depression . When I told them that the ice was nearly fresh , Langmanprotested that it could n't be fresh : that it was nothing but frozen salt water and that those who ate it would lose their reason . " How much have you eaten ? " I asked . " I have n't eaten any , " Langman said . " I do n't have to ! It stands to reason it 's got to be salt . " " I 've eaten it , " I said . " So has Neal . It 's not salt . Did n't you hear me say it 's fresh  --  almost ? " " Yes , I heard you , " Langman said . " I heard another thing , too : heard Captain Dean say he did n't aim to run the ship ashore . Look at us now ! " Unseen hands fumbled at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crunching came from all around.  | " Has anybody got anything I can put on my head ? " Captain Dean asked . " When I came to get off , the ship had slipped . To get ashore I laid off my coat and wig and had to jump . I ca n't see my hands , but I think I tore off some fingernails on the rock . " Nobody answered . Swede called out , " Send Neal over here to me . " " I 'll come too , " I said . The men were huddled together in an irregular oval between two outcroppings of ledge . The outcroppings were perhaps three feet high  --  no shelter at all until one rose to his feet and got the full force of the wind , snow and spray in his face . No one stood up except from necessity , as when someonemoved a boulder from beneath him and hoisted it to the top of the ledge . To remove a boulder seemed to create more boulders . Underneath them was a hodgepodge of wet grit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find , Swede ? " I asked . " Same as Chips , " Swede said . " Nothing . Just rocks and ledge . Then more seaweed . " " I think this is an island , " Chips said . " When we get the spring tide --  " " Shut up ! " Swede shouted . " Do n't talk about things unless you 're sure of ' em ! Most of the hell in this world comes from loose talk ! " " Now look , " Captain Dean said hoarsely . " We ca n't go on this way , or we 'll freeze to death . My feet are numb already . I ca n't move or think as fast as I could before we went ashore . It took me quite a time to realize the mate was again implying that I ran the ship ashore on purpose . "  |p85The  captain 's voice was as mild as it could be in such a tumult . " That 's neither here nor there . I 'm still captain , and I still give orders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's necessary . Right now I 've got to do everything I can to see that there is a tomorrow for us . If we can last until daylight , and see where to put our feet , we 'll find a better shelter . We can be warm . We 'll be able to sleep . Maybe the ship will hold together . Maybe there 'll be part of her left . What we 've got to do is keep moving , two at a time , all night . " Langman spoke up at once . " I say No ! If anybody moves around over those ice-covered rocks , he 'll break a leg . " " Nobody 's asking anyone to do so , " Captain Dean said . " As near as I can tell from your voice , you 're opposite me . All right : get to your feet . I 'll get to my feet . All the rest start counting out loud . Count slow . Count to a hundred . While you count , the mate and I 'll stamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slap our arms across our chests . When the count is one hundred , the mate and I 'll help those beside us to stand up . The rest of us 'll count a hundred , while they stamp their feet and swing their arms , same as we did . " We had barely started when one of our number screamed horribly , and our rock hollow became a turmoil of flying arms and legs . " It 's Henry , " Captain Dean shouted . " Catch him and hold him ! " Never before had I heard or felt a man in the throes of epilepsy , and when at last Henry Dean was pinioned and lay gurgling and groaningbeneath us , I thought I had plumbed the depths of horror , and knew I could n't endure another night like this.  |p86All  that night I rose , hunched my shoulders to the drivingstorm , stamped my feet , swung my arms ; then pulled Neal to his feet and sank down to count to a hundred over and over again . It was like thunderous eternity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If I 'd been alone , I could n't have borne it . I knew if I stopped that agony of struggling up , facing the driving snow that blistered my face  --  that added to the wet weight of my clammy clothes  --  Neal might stop . The others might stop as well ; so I could n't stop . I could only hope and pray . My prayers were as formless as my hopes  --  Oh God Oh God Oh God Oh God , over and over . Deep within me , underneath the counting aloud and the praying , were other vagrant longings for warmth , for shelter , for an end to the deafening crashing of the waves : flashes of my father and his distress if he could know of our plight ; of how he would blame himself for it ; of how I , like a fool , had protested at being sent to Oxford ; of how I would never again find fault with anything providedI could be warm and dry and have friends about me ....  |p85The  time came , eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , I could see him dimly . Snow , mixed with rain , pelted us from the northeast , but the wet rocks on which we had ached and shivered through that long , long night were visible . All of us had ceased suddenly to be disembodiedvoices and were human beings once more  --  human but wild-eyed at the sights revealed to us by that pallid dawn . We were on an island , as all of us had feared since Chips Bullock had dared hazard that awful suspicion after huntingfor shelter the night before  --  an island , but what an island ! It lay low in the water , like the back of a whale . In a long-gone age it might have been a rounded mountaintop of solid rock , but one that a demonic force had smashed with giant hammers and made into a shattered travesty of flatness . On it there was n't a handful of soil , or a bush , or any growing thing . The sea was all around us , so close that from the hollow where we stood I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , south , east or west . Rimming the island was a border of blackness  --  the seaweed on which we had slithered and fallen the night before . Beyond the black weed the white breakers raced out of the north to spurt up in spray on the north side : then go galloping and bellowingdown the west and east sides of the island ; swingingaround to pound the south side with a sort of ferocious maelstrom of foam . Of the Nottingham there was n't a trace  --  not that we could see . Fourteen of us had spent the night in that rocky depression , and all but three of us were on our feet . Cooky Sipper lay on his face , shuddering and sobbing , great rackingsobs that were frightening . Two seamen , William Saver and Charles Graystock , just lay there with eyes closed . Their faces were greenish . " Please God , " Captain Dean said . " We ca n't have this ! You 're frightened before you need to be ! You 're better off right now than if you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here you 've got good ice to keep you from getting thirsty . You can have it without stealing it , as you tried to do on shipboard . This is no time to be frightened . " Chips Bullock 's hammer was fastened to his belt by a cord . Captain Dean took it from him . " I 'm going to knock ice off the rocks so to have a path to the place where we struck . All those who can walk come with me . I 'll need help with the things that have washed ashore . There must be something . " He was nearly wrong . No man would believe that a ship the size of the Nottingham could have vanished so completely and left so little behind , or that all that cheese and all that butter we had stowed so carefully , while wep89lay in the harbor of Killybegs , could have gone so completely to the bottom . She must have struck at dead low water , around nine o'clock at night . Thus high tide would have been around four o'clock in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the tide should now be half out ; and at the high-water mark there should have been heaps of material from the after cabin , from foc's'l and hold . We found four lengths of deck plank , six timbers from the quarter-deck , a length of tarred rope , three pieces of canvas ripped from their fastenings , a bolt of Irish linen purchased by Captain Dean in Killybegs , a cutlass , the handle of a stewpan , a caulking mallet . Scattered among the shaggy masses of seaweed were fragments of cheese , small , like little sponges . And strangely  --  until I rememberedChips Bullock 's workbag  --  there were as many spikes and nails in crevices beneath the seaweed as there were pieces of cheese . Offshore , caught on something and held in one position , was a floating tangle of yards , sails and cordage that rose sluggishly to the top of each comber that rolled in to break on the fingers of black rock pointing out from every side of the island . Captain Dean halted us just short of the seaweed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly hear him above the roar of the waves . " Langman , you and Mellen and Chips Bullock lay hold of the canvas , the planks and timbers and drag ' em back to the hole in the rocks . Take the tarred rope and set Cooky , Graystock and Saver to unraveling it . If they keep on being sick , drive ' em . We 've got to get ourselves under shelter tonight . "  |p90He  pulled at the waterlogged pieces of canvas , and with his pocket knife hacked off a small square . " Yes , " Langman said , " and while we 're doing that , you 'll eat the cheese . " " Mr. Langman , " Captain Dean said , " I realize you 're under something of a strain . Every scrap of cheese we find will be wrapped in this square of canvas and divided into equal portions . Make no mistake about that . On this island we 'll all share alike . " Captain Dean motioned to us to come close to him . " Rememberone thing above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to crawl on hands and knees than to risk falling . " His hands had been concealed beneath his long vest . He held them out to us so that we could see them , front and back . Every finger had been cut almost to the bone by barnacles . Four of his fingernails were torn off . The finger ends were raw but , perhaps because of the cold , were not bloody . " That 's what a fall can do to you , " the captain warned . " You ca n't afford to break an arm or a leg . Now spread out and hunt for those scraps of cheese . " He spoke heavily to Langman . " If you ca n't make Cooky and Saver and Graystock pick oakum , you and Mellen and White do it yourselves . There 's just a chance that we can get fire out of it somehow  --  if it 'll ever dry . " For the benefit of the rest of us he said , " I 've got a pistol and some wet powder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We crawled over that slippery brown seaweed like animalsnosing around a midden . We found fragments of cheese forced into and under the brown wet weed . Every piece of weed had to be lifted up to expose the rock hol/lows beneath . The coldness that went with handling that weed was unbearable . After two minutes of it , the pain in my hands forced me to hug myself until the sharp agony subsided . Tears ran down my cheeks , but there was nothing I could do about it . Acting on the captain 's orders , Neal went from one to another , with his square of canvas , collecting the fragments of cheese we pressed together in apple-sized pellets as boys make snowballs . After a search that seemed endless , we had picked up about as much as would have made three whole cheeses . Neal , making a final round , passed us the captain 's orders . " He says to go back to the hole and rest , " he told us . " We 'll hunt again at dead low tide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hollow in the rock . Perhaps something about the salt water in the wet seaweed had added to the pain in our feet , but so intense was that pain that our faces were contorted to the semblance of gargoyles  --  something not human . At the hollow , we found that Langman , Mellen and Chips had fixed two short planks over the ledges on either side , folded the ragged piece of sail across them , and weighted both sail and planks with boulders . There was room to lie flat beneath it , packed close together . Flimsy as it was , it partly screened us from the pelting snow and rain . It was n't much of a shelter , but it was a shelter ; and we crawled beneath it to lie inert . My brain , as numb as my hands , moved slowly . Captain Dean 's voice was calm and full . " We 've got to find some way to reach the canvas that 's afloat . We must have that cordage for making oakum . " To Langman he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Nothing , " Langman admitted . " By the time we rigged the shelter , we were so close to frozen we crawled under it . " " Now look , " Captain Dean urged , " we 've got to have oakum . We can lie on it . We can braid it into something to pull over our heads and faces . Maybe we can dry it so a flint and steel will work on it . " " Where 's that cheese ? " Langman asked . " All right , " the captain said . " We picked up twenty-six balls of it . I 'll cut ' em in even parts . We 'll eat half today and half tomorrow . " " Why should you cut ' em ? " Langman asked . " Why should you say how much we can have ? Since you ran us on this rock , I do n't trust you to do anything right . Anyway , you promised we could take a vote today on who 'd be captain . You should n't be captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was long silent . When he did speak , his voice was placid . " How long do you think it 'll take you to decide ? " " Not long , " Langman said , " especially if you go outside . It wo n't be a fair vote if you do n't . " Captain Dean seemed unruffled . " I suppose you 'd like my brother Henry to go outside , too . " " Yes , " Langman said , " if it 's going to be really fair , your brother should go . So should Whitworth . They 're all on your side . " There seemed to be no end to his effrontery . Swede spoke up . " That does n't sound reasonable , Langman . Why do n't you go out ? You 're voting for yourself , are n't you ? " " I have n't made up my mind yet , " Langman said . Swede laughed , but without humor . " I 've heard that be/fore ! When anybody says that , it means he 's made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're wasting time , " Captain Dean said . " I 'll go out , but my brother wo n't . Neither will Miles Whitworth . They 're entitled to vote on who they 'll obey . I 'll stay out long enough to cut seaweed for us to eat with the cheese . Seaweed ca n't hurt us , and it 'll make the cheese go fur-ther . " He backed out into the snow and the rain , leaving the canvas-wrapped balls of cheese in my hands . " Now , " Langman said , " we want to do this all fair and honest . I do n't care who 's made captain , but I know Cooky Sipper wants me to be . He said so just after we got the canvas up . So did Graystock and Saver . All three of ' em voted for me . " His voice sounded painfully virtuous . " Cooky has n't said a word since the captain helped him into this hole , " Swede said . " If you know what Cooky wants , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you I heard him , " Langman cried . " Mellen heard him , too . Did n't you , Mellen ? " Mellen agreed promptly . " Yes , I certainly did . I heard him say , I want Mr. Langman . ' " " Well , I did n't , " Chips Bullock said . " I did n't even see Langman talk to Cooky . When we were stretching the canvas , Langman said people as sick as Cooky and Graystockand Saver ought to have a separate hole in the rock , all to themselves . If I get sick , I do n't want to be put off in a hole in a rock with somebody that ca n't talk to me . I vote for Captain Dean . " " You 're an awful fool , Chips , " Langman said . " You know as well as I do he 's been trying to get us in troublep94ever since we left the Nore . First it was privateers and then there was this insurance money he was bound to get . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen the size of this island . We did n't pile up on it because of anything Captain Dean did . We had bad luck . If Captain Dean had been aiming for it , only a miracle would have brought us within a mile of it on a night like last night . " " Neal is youngest , " I said . " He ought to have first say in this voting . " " I vote for Captain Dean , " Neal answered quickly . Langman sat up straight , bumped his head against one of the crosspieces that supported the canvas and fell back again between his fellow conspirators , Mellen and White . " Neal says that because he 's the captain 's favorite , " he said in a shaking voice . " If a captain gets you into trouble , anybodyought to have sense enough to know he 'll never get you out of it . Probably the captain threatened young Neal with punishment unless he voted for him . I say his vote ought to be disallowed . " " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Why are you so dead set on discrediting my brother ? What do you hope to gain by it ? " " I do n't expect to gain anything by it , " Langman snapped . " I 've got a great respect for the truth , that 's all . If any British sea captain does the things your brother has done , he ought to be exposed so he ca n't make a nuisance of himself on the high seas . " " Langman , " Swede said , " you 're a hard man to argue with . Everything you say is wrong . You make a liar out of any person who tries to set you right . I vote for CaptainDean . " " I vote for Captain Dean , " I said . " That 's five . Whyp95does n't somebody try to get a word out of Saver , or Graystock , or Cooky ? " " I 'm ranking officer of this ship 's company until this vote is settled , " Langman said . " I refuse to let men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ! I told you they 've settled on me . I know Mellen and White are for me , and so I 'll vote for myself , and that makes six . " " Well , " I said , " that accounts for all but Christopher Gray and Harry Hallion . Gray 's a gunner and he scaled the guns with Swede . He must know Swede would n't be for Captain Dean if Mr. Langman 's charges are true . I know they are n't true , and so does Swede . " There 's another thing to be considered . We have no way of knowing where this island is , but it ca n't be far from Portsmouth , and Captain Dean has friends in Portsmouth . If anybody 's ever going to need friends , we are , when we get ashore . I ca n't imagine anything more unwise than cutting away from Captain Dean at a time like this . " And bear this in mind , too . He was willing to leave this shelter so we could vote , but Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? It does to me ! It proves the captain plays fair , but Mr. Langman. does n't . I 'm going to ask both Hallion and Gray to vote for Captain Dean . " Captain Dean 's boots clattered on the rocks outside , and he came crawling back among us with an armful of drippingrockweed clutched to his chest . " The wind 's dropping , " he said . " Inside half an hour the tide will be as low as it 'll go with this wind . " " You got no right coming in here like this , " Langman shouted . " We have n't finished voting . " " I vote for Captain Dean , " Gray said . " Me too , " Hallion said.  |p96I  told the captain that there had been seven for him and six against . " I 'm surprised , " Captain Dean said . " I only expected three against me . " " Mr. Langman voted Cooky Sipper , Graystock and Saver against you , " I said . The captain stared contemplatively at Langman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting the rockweedinto foot-long sections . The weed was brown and slippery , with little oval bulbs at intervals . " Here , " he said to Neal , " pass these around and I 'll cut the cheese . Take a bite of the cheese and right away bite off a piece of rockweed and chew them up together . " " You got no right to tell these people what to eat , " Langman said . " You never know what 's poison and what is n't . " " You do n't have to eat it if you do n't want to , " CaptainDean said . " It 's just a way of making the cheese go further . " He pressed the balls of cheese together to form a single cake , halved it and rewrapped one half in the piece of canvas . The other half he carefully divided into fourteen cubes while all of us rose on our elbows to watch him . He passed a cube to each of us who could stretch out his hand . Cooky Sipper , Graystock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portions till they ask for ' em , " Captain Dean said . Then he turned his head to look at Langman . " On second thought , " he said , " I ' 11 let Neal hold it for them . " The seaweed , slippery to the tongue , had something of the sea 's freshness about it , and when chewed with cheese it was n't bad . I could have eaten all the cheese that thep97captain had wrapped in his square of canvas . By itself , though , the weed was n't good , and when my little square of cheese was gone , I ate no more weed . On our second journey to the northern shore of the island , the captain , by the grace of God , found a coil of cordage wound around a boulder that could just be reached when a receding breaker went hissing and rattling back over the black seaweed . Twice the captain lowered himself toward that precious rope , only to come scramblingback among us as another breaker churned toward us . We tried forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seaweed , but that was no good . While the captain tried to untangle the rope from the boulder , a wave surged in ; and before we could pull him up over that damnable seaweed , he was soaked to his armpits . He shivered , slapped himself and stamped his feet . " Think of something , " the captain urged . " We 've got to have that cordage and canvas ! We 've got to reach it somehow . The next high tide may rip it loose ; it may go out on tomorrow 's low tide , when it 'll be too dark to see . If we wait twenty-four hours these breakers are sure to wash it away ! " Chips stepped forward to the captain 's side . " If we could get a running bowline on the cordage beyond the rock , " he said , " it might hold until we caught it . " " Running bowline ! " the captain said . He turned to stare speculatively at the rock around which the cordage was twined . A wave roared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boulder was set in a patch of crushed shells andp98pebbles , on which there was no weed . The cordage was jammed between the gravelly stuff and the boulder 's base . The captain motioned for Swede to come and stand beside him . I knew what they discussed , though I could n't hear a word they spoke because of the roaring of the breakers . In the end Swede nodded his head , and the captain sent Langman hurrying off . In no time he was back with the piece of rope out of which the oakum was to have been made . Five minutes later Swede and the captain , with Neal between them , were showing Neal the working of a runningbowline . When Neal stood there on the edge of the rock , with that fearful background of foam and roaring waves beyondhim , I could n't bear to look at him : yet I could n't bear not to . I knew we had to have that cordage : knew that somebody had to go for it , and I knew , too , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightest : in all likelihood he was the quickest . At a signal from the captain he slid down the weed in the wake of the receding wave . He put me in mind of an otter . He threw the rope before him and over the boulder as a boy throws a skipping rope : fell on his stomach over the boulder-top ; slipped the loose end of the rope under the cordage and through the noose . Just as a towering breaker curled before breaking , he darted back , the ropeendin his hand , no wetter than when he had jumped down . Swede , stretched far forward , grasped one of his wrists , the captain the other , and the two of them snapped Neal up over the face of the ledge . Whether that running bowline would grip the cordagep99tightly enough to let us haul in the floating yards and sails to which it was attached , we could n't know . The captain pulled it tight , then drew it gently toward him . The cordagerose up to the level of the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the captain in his pulling . When the bowline held , we all pulled , but still the cordage did n't come loose . Twice more Neal went down into that foaming hole to move the bowline higher on the cordage  --  and at last we had our hands on the tangled wet rope . The rest of that day was horrible beyond words . We hauled at that dripping cordage , fearful each moment that it would part from the floating timbers and sails to which it was attached . When we 'd taken in all the slack we could , we strained and struggled to bring the tangled mass closer to shore . The labor of hauling in that raft of junk seemed greater than mere men could undertake . The raft was attached to something  --  perhaps to a part of the sunken hull : perhaps to an anchor cable : perhaps to the stump of a mast , so that I had the feeling that we were trying to draw up a part of the ocean floor . Worse than that , it was dripping wet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northeaster becomes insupportablebecause of the violent aching in the hands . One can pull at it for a minute or two , but then he must stop and clutch his hands between his thighs in order to be free of that terrible aching . Equally bad was our dubious footing on the surface of that rock . As we gained ground on the cordage , we staggered , slipped , fell on the icy ledges , and still con/trived to move more and more of the cordage inshore : to find boulders around which to belay it , lest our gains be snatched from us by the voracious seas . For the first time , that day , we saw the flood tide march up to the high-water mark , to leave our poor island shrunk to a mere nothing , barely rising above the tops of the combers that swept at us and past us  --  though in the sweepingit helped us in our efforts to draw the sails and spars closer . In my pain and weariness and terror  --  and in that terror I was not alone  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If at flood tide the breakers crowded up so close to us , where would they be when December 's full moon and spring tide were upon us  --  and every shore has its spring tide twice a month , at new moon and full moon  --  tides far higher than ordinary tides : so high that they seem bent on submerging land that can not be submerged at any other time . And how could my tutors and professors at Oxford have pretended to find truth and beauty in the adventures of Ulysses ? Ulysses , confronted by such tribulations as those that surrounded us , could n't have helped himself  --  could only have turned to and been succored by a god or a goddess in the shape of somebody or other  --  perhaps by Minerva in the form of an eagle . If he had been in our dire straits , ever-dependable Mercury would have built for him a stout ship from newly cut lumber  --  yes , and seasoned it for him , too . Mercury would even have done it for him on Boon Island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have told him how to discovera great store of cheese . In the depths of his distress , Minerva would have appeared to comfort and encouragep101him  --  to restore to him the beauty of his youth ; Jupiter would have thundered from heaven , ordering the seas to subside ! But the unhappy truth was that nothing like the Odysseyhas ever been or ever will be . The troubles of Ulysses were brought upon him by his own stupidity and not , as Homer would have us believe , by the vindictiveness of Poseidon , that green-whiskered ruler of the vasty deep . The dreadful facts we faced on Boon Island taught me that Ulysses was a dilatory and philandering old fool ; and if he had been with us on our rock , he 'd have been exactly in our situation  --  despairing , helpless , hopeless , and perpetuallyon the verge of death.  |p102I  hoped that when the northeaster blew itself out , the sea would grow calm , but it did n't . When the wind swung , it backed into the northwest and west , meaning that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of driving snow and rain , but breakers still roared deafeninglyon the north and west . They pounded less on the south and east , but still they pounded , throwing off manes of white foam . The wind seemed colder than on the night we were wrecked . With the break of day I heard Captain Dean calling Neal to come outside . I went out , too , to find the captain staring off to the northwest . " Neal , " the captain said , " see if you can remember those maps you drew in the little book . " Neal said he remembered . " Can you recall the chief places you lettered on the maps , starting with Cape Porpoise ? " the captain asked . " Cape Porpoise , " Neal said , " Cape Arundel , Bald Head Cliff , Cape Neddick --  " " That 's it , " the captain cried . " Bald Head Cliff ! That'sp103where the waves shoot up , yonder , and this is Boon Island ! The last time I sailed east from Portsmouth , I sailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to starboard and Bald Head Cliff to larboard ! " As the eastern sky grew brighter we could see the high dark red rock face of Bald Head Cliff . Spouts of spray rose high against it . If we 'd gone ashore on Bald Head Cliff in a northeaster , instead of on Boon Island , the ship and every last one of us would have been battered to a pulp in a minute 's time . Captain Dean , cheered by the sight of the mainland , lay flat to crawl beneath the shelter and shout the good news to those within . " Listen , " he said . " I know where we are ! We 're on Boon Island ! Just south of us are the Isles of Shoals , where the Pepperrells and other Portsmouth people have fish stages . All winter there 's fishing off the Isles of Shoals . There 'll be fishing shallops passing us from every direction  --  Portsmouth , Kittery , York . If we set up something they can see , they 'll find us . They 'll take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go to work , we wo n't be able to set up anything . Your blood wo n't circulate . You 'll die . You 've got to come out and drag cordage and junk . " Nobody said a word . " Another thing , " Captain Dean said . " There 's seals off the south side of this island . I saw their heads in the water , following me and watching me , just after dawn , the way they always do . There 's ducks , thousands of ' em , swimming in big flocks off the south shore . " Seals have to rest somewhere . If I can catch one of ' em asleep around midnight , we 'll have enough to eat for a month . He 'll have fat that maybe we can set fire to . " " Where 's the rest of that cheese ? " Langman asked  | " Right here with Neal Butler , " Captain Dean said . " Those who want it must come out and get it . " He backed out himself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the exception of Cooky Sipper . Even Graystock and Saver came out , looking like corpses . The captain took the canvas-wrapped cheese from Neal . " Go for seaweed to eat with it , " he told Neal . " I 'll cut and pass out the cheese myself . " He gave each of us a little cube of cheese . When he came to Graystock and Saver , he went upwind of them and eyed them contemptuously . " You did n't eat your cheese yesterday , " the captain said . " It 's been saved for you , and I 'm giving you yesterday'sand today 's too . You do n't deserve either . You 've been letting the rest of us work for you , and by rights your rations ought to go to those who 've been doing the work . " " We were sick , and could n't work , " Graystock said . " You 're a liar , " Captain Dean said . " Cooky Sipper 's sick and ca n't stand up , but you 're no sicker than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all ! If you were n't , you 'd get up and move off to do what has to be done , same as the rest of us . You 've got to stay human , not be like helpless babies , or pigs that can be smelled a mile down-wind ! " The captain was furious , no doubt about it , but he held himself under control , which is n't easy when dealing with people like Graystock and Saver  --  or Langman . He gave them their little ration of cheese ; then turned back to the rest of us . " Up to now , " he told us harshly , " I have n't said anything about Saver and Graystock , but now I know where we are  --  now I 'm able to see the thingsp105God gives us , so we can help ourselves and help each other  --  I 'm going to say something . Yes , and about anyone who thinks he can do like Saver and Graystock . " " It 's your duty as captain , " Langman said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em . " Captain Dean rounded on him . " What do you think I am doing ? You ought to be called Wrong-end Langman ! I want Graystock and Saver to go to work and help save themselves , instead of refusing to work . They 're doing nothing but setting the rest of us an example in discouragementand despair . Nobody ever accomplished anything in this world without working day and night ; but most peopleare such damned fools that they do n't want to work at all , not at anything , just like Saver and Graystock . Give ' em a free hand and they wo n't even work to save their lives ! You know the most discouraging thing in the world , Langman ? It 's for a lot of hard-working people to have to look at and listen to those who 'd like to keep on living without doing anything at all . " " I suppose , " Langman said , " I was Wrong-end Langman when I said you wanted to run us ashore . " Captain Dean looked at him long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " do n't forget that you were No-lookout Langman before we struck . Just what is it that you 'd do , right now , if you had the say ? " " I 'd build a boat , " Langman said promptly . " With nothing but a hammer , a cutlass , a caulking malletand our pocket knives ? " Captain Dean asked . Langman glowered at him . " I 'll tell you exactly what we must do first of all , " CaptainDean said . " We have to locate the highest point on this rock able to hold a mast that wo n't blow down . Ap106mast that people on shore may be able to see if they ever come to the water 's edge to look for driftwood or seaweed , or if they ever put out for fish or lobsters . Then we have to build a tent around it . " Even before we do that we need oakum to lie on : oakum to protect our faces and hands and feet : oakum for caps and mittens and bellybands : oakum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : oakum to keep the rain from driving through the canvas . What 's more , we ca n't build a boat until we have oakum . The sort of boat we build will need all the oakum we can pick between dawn and dark for a year ! " So right now we 'll start to separate all the junk we pulled ashore yesterday . " While we do that , I want Chips Bullock and Swede Butler to pick the highest spot they can find  --  preferably a smooth piece of ledge that has a crack in it that will let us step a mast with a canvas flag on top  --  a big one , that can be seen six miles away . " I 'm putting Neal Butler in charge of making white oakum from the tangled cordage and black oakum from the tarred shrouds . He 's to take Hallion with him and Saver and Graystock and George White . " I want Mr. Langman with me  --  also Mr. Whitworth and Gray  --  Mellen and my brother Henry . We 'll free the yards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cordage that can be used to lash down the tent . " When the mast for the new tent is stepped , all usable things are to be brought close to the mast . " In addition to all these things , we 'll have to patrol this island at dawn each day , and at sundown , and again at high tide and low tide . I 'll take the first patrol with Georgep107White . Miles Whitworth will take the second patrol with Neal Butler . Mr. Langman 'll take the third patrol with Nicholas Mellen . Swede Butler will take the fourth patrol with Henry Dean . Chips Bullock will take the fifth patrol with Christopher Gray . " For the first time Langman seemed to have no objection to Captain Dean 's plans . " What about this shelter we 've been living in for the past three nights ? " " You mean last night , " Captain Dean said . " I 'll tell you what about it . We 'll floor it with oakum , and if any one of us falls so low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do  --  by going to the place I select as a head and taking his breeches down and otherwise behaving in a civilized and Christian manner  --  he 'll stay nights in this shelter until he 's fit to live with other humans . For that matter , we may all have to stay here one more night , until the oakum 's picked , the canvas separated from that pile of junk , and the cordage straightened so it can be used . " Meanwhile the cutlass and Chips 's hammer and the caulking mallet are to be used by those who do the separating . And I 'll be responsible for them . " Those who pick oakum will have to do it with their own pocket knives  --  and before the oakum-picking starts , I want Neal Butler to take Saver and Graystock to a pool of water on the south side of this island and see that they clean their breeches as well as they can be cleaned . Let it be a lesson to you  --  that I have to put a boy in charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ruin a furious ocean can wreak on a stout ship in an hour 's time is beyond the comprehension of those who have n't seen it . It wrenches spikes from wet wood . It knotsp108cordage into such intricacies as hangman 's knots , six-strand Matthew Walkers , double cat's-paws , three-bight Turk'sheads . It smashes a main yard in the slings , strips a stern post from an inner post as readily as a child twists off a doll 's foot . The first thing we freed from the mass of junk was the foretopsail yard for Chips and Swede to use as the center post of the tent . It was lodged in a frozen hoorah's-nest of canvas , rigging and ratlins that defied our knives almost as though it had been made of iron . Captain Dean constantly urged us to cut the tarred rope in eight-inch lengths . " If ever we 're able to make a fire , " he said , " we 'll probably have the tarred rope to thank for it ; and the lengths 'll have to be short or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half freed when Neal came stumbling to us . " Cooky 's dead , " he told the captain . The captain snapped his pocket knife shut , stared hard at Neal : then straightened up to look at the breakers , dirty green-white in the watery morning sunlight . " How do you know ? " he asked heavily . " I took him the first oakum we made , " Neal said . " I thought it might make him easier . His mouth was filled with phlegm . I tried to get it out , but could n't . " He stared at his hands and added , " His face was black . He must have choked to death . " " I see , " Captain Dean said . He examined his damaged fingers , stooped for a stone with which to pry open his knife again ; peered at the blade as though he found it strange : then caught up a rope-end and haggled off a fifteen-foot length . " Well , " he said slowly , " go back to your oakum pickers. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of Cooky . We 'll have to take him to the south shore and put him in the water . There 's just a possibility he might float to York and start someone looking for us . " To me he said , " Keep right on as you are . See the others do , too . " He gave me the hammer . " Could n't you take his coat for yourself ? " Neal asked . " Why yes , " Captain Dean said , " I think it would be all right to take his coat . " They stumbled off together across the icy rocks , and we went on freeing the foretopsail yard of its twisted accumulation of junk . I was sorry to see them go , because there were a few things that I should have said to Captain Dean . I wanted to speak about eating . This morning and yesterdaymorning each one of us had eaten as much seaweed as could be packed into a pint mug , and less than half that amount of cheese . Already my stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked there . Now the cheese was gone . The captain had spoken about going out at midnight in the hope of finding a seal asleep on the rocks , but I knew a little something about seals from watching them come up the Thames after whitebait . Neither Captain Dean nor anybody else was going to find a seal sleeping on ledges in this kind of weather , when a single wave could crush a seal against a rock as readily as it could crush a cheese . They slept while floating where waves only rocked them like a cradle . There was a thought hidden in all this , but it eluded me . My brain , like all the rest of me , was numb from cold andp110wet clothes , which felt as though nothing , not even heat , could ever dry them . Seals , I thought confusedly , ate anything . They 'd certainlyeat cheese , and I 'd heard that somewhere on the lower Thames a seal had killed a woman and eaten her . If that was so , then a seal would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it floated or sank  --  whether it was clothed or unclothed . Therefore there was no reason why Captain Dean should n't take Cooky 's coat for himself , and the rest of his clothes for those who needed them  --  and there was n't one of us who did n't need more clothes . I looked over my shoulder toward the patch of canvas under which we 'd sheltered . Captain Dean and George White were dragging Cooky 's body over the icy rocks and ledges . The rope was fastened around Cooky 's neck , and I was glad to see that the body was unclothed , so there apparently was no need for me to mention those confused thoughts of mine to the captain . There were some other things , though , that I had n't said , and it was hard for me to remember what they were . With our cheese gone , we would have nothing to eat , so if the captain wanted Cooky 's body to float ashore , it seemed to me , he 'd do better to leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If it were frozen , it would float , maybe , as a cake of ice floats . I wondered whether I was right , Only a little of an icebergshows above water . " What happens to a frozen body ? " I asked Langman . " What do you mean ? " Langman demanded . " I mean , would Cooky Sipper float if he were frozen ? " " Of course he would n't , " Langman said.  | " How do you know ? " I asked . " Did you ever see a frozen man in the water ? " " No , " Langman said , " but he 'd sink . " I felt fairly sure that Langman was wrong about this , as about everything else . An iceberg never sank , did it ? The captain and George White made hard work of getting Cooky to the seaweedy rock-fingers of the south shore . They would pull Cooky 's body forward until his head was almost at their ankles , then they 'd get themselvesacross another ten feet of ledges , flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull Cooky to them again . If I hurried , I told myself , I could reach them even now , before they put the body in the water . I felt Langman looking at me , a mocking twist on his thin , sallow face . That was a bad habit of his  --  staring fixedlyat those he disliked , apparently under the impression that the person at whom he stared was n't conscious of his stare  --  which of course was n't the case . That was like Langman . He was about as perceptive and sensitive as a pig . " What you got on your mind ? " Langman asked . " Why , nothing , " I said . " I 've got nothing on my mind . " He looked over his shoulder at the captain and Whitepulling and hauling at Cooky 's body . " Well , " I said , " this is n't clearing that foretopsail yard . " We had it cleared by midafternoon , soon after Swede and Chips came for it and for a square of canvas to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a ledge with a deep crack in it  --  one into which a spar could be pushed and shimmed into place with wedge-shaped rocks.  | " Once we get that spar in place , " Swede said to Langman , " it 'll outlast you . " Langman looked scornful . " If we do n't build a boat , it 'll outlast all of us . " Chips swung his head from side to side . " I wish I had my axe , " he said irrelevantly . " When we were cleaning that slot for the spar , we found slivers of rock . They 're shaped like splitting wedges . We can use ' em for chisels if they do n't splinter when pounded . " He and Swede carried away the foretopsail yard and the square of canvas ; but dark came down on us before we were able to unsnarl the sails that were wrapped with rigging as a fly is wrapped in a spider web . So we spent that night in the shelter in which Cooky had sobbed and moaned night after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights in that shelter ? Why no ! It was only two nights . I found it difficult to keep track . The first night we 'd spent in a crevice , without covering . The next two nights we 'd had a strip of canvas above us . Things were different with Cooky gone . Not better , perhaps , but quieter . Cooky had always groaned and sobbed ; and lying somewhere near him was another who moaned and groaned . It may have been Graystock . It may have been Saver . It could , God knows , have been almost any one of us . Now , with Cooky gone , there was a lot less sobbing.  |p113I  think our labors of the day before , and our depression because of the death of Cooky Sipper , would have kept us from even thinking of continuing our work on the tent on Thursday . The bitter northwest wind was more biting than that of the northeaster . I thought wryly of the winter chill of the Bodleian , often so penetrating that students insisted they could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect upon us forced us to do things we could n't otherwise have done . And that 's another thing my sojourn on Boon Island did for me : it made me impatient of a person who , because of fancied ill-health or discomfort , fails to execute a task or complete an undertaking . No man is worth his salt if , by such a failure , he inconveniences others . A man ca n't , I know , stay awake indefinitely , though I think he somehow contrives to sleep or to lose consciousnessin spite of pain or mental trouble . Yet I 'd have sworn I never slept on the night of the thirteenth . All night long my feet and legs either throbbed or burned or itched . Each one of those three ills seemed unendurable by itself , andp114certainly there was no respite from the constant movement of the men around me  --  an uneasy thrashing , as dogs thrash when wounded and in distress . When daylight came I could see as well as feel the reason for my ailing legs and feet . My legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a discoloring ridge of flesh puffed out above the boot tops . Captain Dean , examining his own legs , said there was no help for it : the boots would have to go . " It 's the wet , " he said , " and the cold that comes with this northwest wind . The only good thing about a northwestwind is that there 's a calm after it stops blowing  --  if it ever does . " He raised his voice to make it heard above the rumble and smashing of the breakers . " Sharpen your knives , everyone , " he said . " You 'll find whetstones under you . That 'll remind you there 's always something good to be said about anything or anyone . There 'll never be any shortage of rocks on this island ; none of ice , either . " Here 's what you 'll have to do  --  and save the stitching . We 'll need it to tie bandages . " He severed the top stitch of the seam that runs down the inner part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down as the ankle . From the ankle he cut straight down through the leather to the edge of the sole . From that cut he slid his knife blade around the heel , pressing the blade against the sole . He did the same to the forward part ; then folded the whole boot outward from his leg and foot . When he rolled up his long underwear , both foot and leg were shocking sights . The leg , puffed and blistered ,  |p115had  open sores where his underwear and wet breeches had rubbed . The toes were pallid . Some of the toenails came away when the boot was folded over ; but the toes did n't bleed : they just stayed that queer grayish white . The captain drew a sharp breath . " You 'll have to expect a little pain at first , " he said , " but that 's only the blood coming back into your legs . " The captain studied those nailless toes . Then he said slowly , " Before any of the rest of you start cutting off your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll have to make something to put on our feet so we can walk . " " Walk with feet like that one of yours ! " Langman cried . " I do n't have to answer that , do I ? " Captain Dean asked . " We 've got to walk . More cheese might come ashore . We must have more oakum . We must move out from this wet shelter into a tent . We must have a place where we can pick oakum under cover . We ca n't make oakum or raise a tent unless we go outside . To do that we 'll have to wash our legs in something warm that 'll clean ' em . " Langman groaned . " Something warm ! Where 'll you find anything warm around here ? Even if you found something , what would you put it in ? " " I 've watched everyone urinating about ten times a day , have n't I ? " Captain Dean asked . " I hated to see it wasted , but I could n't give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fire from the powder . Well , the powder 's as wet today as it was when we were wrecked , and I 've carried it next to my skin day and night . So now I 'll put the powder in a canvas bag . We 'll use the hornp116for the warm stuff you think we have n't got . Now take White and Miles with you and go for that oakum . And remember : do n't urinate till I tell you to . " He sawed delicately with his knife-blade at the stitches in his other boot top , and picked out the thread as carefullyas though his life depended upon it  --  and perhaps it did . I was shocked and frightened by that glimpse of the captain 's leg and foot , and by the stench that had come from it . I was sure my own feet and legs were no different ; and while it seemed impossible to walk at all on feet so painful , I not only knew that I could do it , but I was filled with a frenzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . Those who have never picked oakum  --  and few people do it except sailors when there 's nothing else to be done on shipboard , or those who live in prisons or poorhouses  --  find it tedious , hard on the hands and on the nerves , to separate those stiff strands of fiber that make up a rope : then , with finger-twistings and knife-points , to fluff out each strand so that it becomes again a flattened mat of hemp . But when oakum is needed to keep legs and feet from rotting , almost anyone works hard and quickly learns the knack of reducing a cable or a hawser to its original state of untwisted strands . At the captain 's direction we practiced first on him , cutting two six-foot lengths of linen from the bolt , and a short length to use as a sponge . Each six-foot strip was a bandage , down one side of the leg , across the foot , and up the other side of the leg.  |p117I  do n't know what we 'd have done without that bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream of what would have happened to me if we 'd had no linen to bind our legs . Each side of the bandage lapped twice around the leg ; but before the lapping was done , a poultice of oakum was set in place on the upper and lower part of the foot , from ankle to knee . Then the protruding linen was folded over the oakum , and narrow bands of linen held the whole in place . Over the outer linen was wrapped a square of canvas . Thus our feet and legs were cased in a quadruple bandage  --  asingle layer of linen , a layer of oakum , a quadruple layer of linen , and a canvas leggin . The captain had us slit the long legs of his underwear , and the legs of his breeches as well , and these were tied in place with the thread taken from his boots . Since all these bandages were so bulky as to make the boots useless , he cut off the boot tops and made each top into a sort of knee boot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tarred rope . We tried to economize on urine , but could n't . The powder horn , its thick end removed and its stopper pounded tight , held about a pint , and we had to have one and a half hornfuls for each two legs and feet . In this we were fortunate , for the entire company , fearful of losing feet or legs , was consumed with the need to urinate , and calls for the powder horn were constant . When we had finished with Captain Dean , he helped Neal and me to cut off our own boots and bandage our legs and feet . Before he turned back my first boot , he put his hand on my knee . " Do n't look at them , " he said . " They are n't as bad as they look , and you 'll gain nothing by seeingp118them . " There was no doubt in my mind that he was right , and I think that , by obeying him , both Neal and I saved ourselves from self-pity or despondency  --  states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to help him , Captain Dean sat the rest of the crew on the two ledges that had formed the wall of our shelter , and over their knees he laid the canvas beneath which we had slept . While we worked on them , they picked oakum , using the canvas as a table . Below the canvas the captain , Neal and I , on our padded knees , washed all those legs and feet with the warm contents of the powder horn . This washing was painful beyond belief , and the sailors howled and cursed as their legs and feet were sopped with urine . Nor could I blame them , for the toes of some of them broke off in our hands , and their blisters and abscesses , in some cases , were so deep that the bone showed through.  |p119Six  of us were able  --  perhaps " willing " is a better word  --  to crawl from beneath the canvas on the morning after we had bandaged our legs . All thirteen of us should have come out , for the tide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore , and our craving for something to put in our stomachs was almost overpowering . Those beside myself who dragged themselves into that cold dawn were Captain Dean , Neal Butler , Swede Butler , Langman and White  --  and God knows I probably could n't have done it if the captain had n't crawled out first , with Neal close behind him , and Swede close on Neal 's heels . What Neal could do , I told myself , I must do . Langman only came with us , I think , because of his overwhelming fear that one of us might find a scrap to eat and conceal it from him . White , I thought , came because he was a bos'n , and bos'ns regard themselves as being hardier than other seamen , and averse to being outdone by anyone . As we made our painful patrol of the high-water mark , we saw two seals playfully nosing at a floating object , andp120simultaneously Captain Dean came across a slender stick of wood that might have been a broom handle . The seals swam around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisked at it with their hind flippers , until the water shoaled . Then they abandoned it , and lay offshore , rising high in the water , puffing out their whiskers and watching us from staring round eyes . I would have given anything I ever hoped to own if I could have got my hands on one of those seals , though I well knew I could never have held him . When a breaker thrust their plaything against the rock , we found it to be two bones from salted beef , held together by the muscles of the joint . To add to this bit of good fortune , Captain Dean came across a lump of cheese the size of a child 's head , and Langman found a mussel from which grew scores of long streamers of thin kelp , which Langman insisted were good to eat . The mussel he discarded with an expression of distaste , before the captain could stop him . " A mussel is full of meat , " the captain protested . " Well , one mussel would n't have gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one came from . " When we returned to the canvas shelter with this treasure trove , the others came out , dreadful haggard objects . Each was given a streamer of kelp ; and all of them , as intent as an audience at a play , watched us smash those beef bones with rocks , and , with knife blades , extract a dab of marrow for each man . " We 'll eat all the cheese right now , " Captain Dean said . " We 'll lash that saucepan handle to the end of this broomstickwith spun yarn . Maybe , when the tide is right , we'llp121find enough mussels to give us a real meal  --  and can pry ' em off the rocks without losing our hands . " Then , " he went on , " we 'll all go to the flag mast and build the tent and pick more oakum for it . We ca n't spend another night in this rotten shelter . " The men , haggard , bearded , misshapen , just stared at him . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biting cold of the night just past . Three of them  --  Saver , Graystock and Mellen  --  crawled silently back beneath the canvas . Captain Dean stooped to peer after them . Then he gave up . After all , there 's no use driving those who have passed the limit of endurance . The size of the tent was determined by the area of the rounded ledge that held the center pole . The ledge was shaped roughly like a humped-up triangle , sliced from the side of an enormous hogshead . This triangle rose from a welter of boulders . It was narrow : then widened as a wedge of orange peel widens , to descend , still widening , and vanish among more boulders . Thus the tent of necessity was three-sided , like a pyramid . Its height was regulated by the distance between the rock and the lowest lashing of the canvas flag . Captain Dean helped us pick the corner posts for the tent . When they were set in place , Swede , Langman and Harry Hallion formed a living step ladder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mast . The rest of us dragged pieces of sail across the rocks , arranging them so they could be fastened to the corner posts with spun yarn.  |p122The  canvas at the base of each of the three sides was anchored by broken pieces of deck-planking . The planks were held down by boulders . The placing of the boulders was a source of great concern to Captain Dean . " If those timbers are n't properly secured , " he said , " the canvas is sure to blow down on us . Such things always happen on the coldest night , when you wo n't be able to see your hand in front of your face . " So outside the single row of boulders atop each plank , he made us lay another row of boulders . Then he insisted we lay a third row on top of this double row  --  big boulders , too large to be handled by one man . How , with my half frozen hands , I could have been of any help in the handling of them , I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so , I had to take a firm grip with my feet , and when I did , they felt as though I stood in nettles . Langman worked as hard as anyone , but he never stopped talking about the boat . As in the matter of privateers , he could n't drop a subject for a minute , once he was embarked on it . " If the full-moon spring tide rises above the top of this rock , " he said , " what good 's a tent going to do us ? Nothing will help us then but a boat . " " Look , " Captain Dean said , " I 've measured this rock . Right here where we 're standing , as near as I can figure , it 's fourteen feet above normal high-water mark . Accordingto my reckoning , the tide rise here is seven feet . I do n't believe any spring tide could be three times as high as a normal tide . " " It can be , " Langman said . " There 's some places only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty/eight feet . I 've heard Woodes Rogers say so when he was sailing to Newfoundland . " " I know those places , " Captain Dean said , " but that 's ' way north of here . The same thing 's true in England . You get some terrible high tides in the Severn estuary , but you never get any such tides on the Isle of Wight , which is n't far away , as the crow flies . And I 'll tell you another thing , Langman . This is the fifteenth of December , and according to my lights --  " " It 's the sixteenth , " Langman interrupted . " Tomorrow 's Sunday . " " No , " the captain said , " this is the fifteenth . Sunday is n't until day after tomorrow . " " I figured it out , " Langman said . " Tomorrow 's Sunday . " " We 've got to get this tent finished , " Captain Dean said , " and there 's no sense arguing over which day 's Sunday . The thing I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon to be due December 27th , a Wednesday . We must have had one spring tide already , because there should have been a new moon day before yesterday . " " The twenty-seventh would be a Thursday , " Langman said . " Well , whichever day of the week it is , " Captain Dean said , " it 's twelve days to spring tide , and if we do n't get this shelter done , and the tide does rise that extra fourteen feet , and we do have another onshore blow , and we do have to have a boat to save our lives , we ca n't have a boat unless we shelter ourselves during those twelve days betweennow and spring tide . The tent has to come first . " Those of us who worked on the tent were the captain ,  |p124Swede  Butler , Langman , Neal , Harry Hallion and George White . All the rest  --  Henry Dean , Christopher Gray , Nicholas Mellen , Saver , Graystock and Bullock  --  as soon as the sides were up took shelter within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saver and Graystock  --  looked as though nothing on earth could ever induce them to come out again . The others , under the urgings of Henry Dean , did their best to pick oakum ; but when they would n't work , and just lay or sat there , their eyes opaque like those of a fish , holding their hands to the pits of their stomach and crouching over them as if to send a little warmth into those numb extremities , there seemed to be nothing to be done about it . We could hear Henry beg them to get on with their picking . That was one of the advantages of the new shelter . We could n't sit up in the old shelter , and so had to go outdoors to pick oakum . In the tent we could stand up , if only three or four stood at a time . The rest could sit up . The day we finished the tent Henry Dean and Nicholas Mellen , fumbling around a little pile of junk we had n't yet untangled , came across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still fastened to a fragment of the yard , and when it was pried loose and unwound , it looked like a piece of soggy cowhide about eighteen inches wide and two feet long . When Henry Dean brought it back to the tent , even the men who seemed half dead sat up to look at it , and there was an instant demand that it be distributed for food . " Food ! " Henry Dean exclaimed . " You ca n't . . . " Then he stopped and said , " I 'll speak to my brother . "  |p125He  came out to where we were rolling boulders against the bottom of the canvas . " The men inside , " he told CaptainDean , " want this rawhide divided . They think they can eat it . I think it might hurt ' em instead of help ' em . " The captain felt it with speculative fingers . " No , " he said slowly . " It would n't hurt ' em . Food is what you think it is . A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to other critters . So do a lot of men . Probably you would n't care much about eating a mouse , but Chinese do and think they 're nice . They eat ' em , and like ' em . You divide this rawhide into thirteen pieces . Give one piece to each man , and make him chop his own into little pieces , just as fine as he can mince ' em . " Perhaps that rawhide did give everyone a little strength , for after each had eaten his share , those in the tent went back to picking oakum . When night came we not only had shelter over us , but we had a layer of oakum beneath us  --  a thin one , to be sure , but one that was n't wet . It was damp , yes ; but it was n't wet , and up to now we had been wet every night  --  wet , and cold with a cold that beggars description . Those who live beneath roofs , or in dry caves , with dry clothes next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exist surrounded by a tumult of breakers , in wet clothes , on sharp wet rocks , and in cold so intense that every boulder in sight is covered with a thick armor of ice . But we had a little more room than we 'd heretofore had , though we still lay tight against each other , belly to buttocksso to take advantage of the slight warmth that each of us , by the grace of God , contrived to hold within himself.  |p126The  world , I 've found , is full of people who can not realize that everything is hard work  --  everything . People turn to sailing , or to fishing , or to acting , or to painting , or to play writing  --  to any one of the thousand different occupations  --  with some sort of a vague idea that it 's easy work . Sometimeswork can be enthralling if it 's done as an avocation instead of out of dire necessity , but it 's hard work just the same . So I question that the building of our boat on Boon Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or chopping wood ; but I suspect that no work has ever been done under such adverse circumstances . The place we selected to build the boat was on the south side of the island , where ledge-fingers ran slopingly out toward the south . The ledges were less abrupt there than on the other three sides , and the surf less violent . It was on the south side , always , that the seals thrust their bullet heads from the water to watch us , and it was aggravating to see twenty or thirty of those round headsp127examining us from popeyes , and puffing out their whiskers at us , as if amazed by our presence on their island . Sometimes , surprisingly , even though the wind blew from the north , a huge swell would roll in toward that south side and there 'd be the watery shadows of ten or more seals floating in it , seemingly higher than we . Just before the wave broke , the seals would rise shoulder-high for a clearer look at us , then slip away , down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roar . I could n't imagine Boon Island without breakers hurrying toward its shores from every direction , as if to a boisterous and senseless rendezvous . The day had started inauspiciously because Langman , having determined that the day was Sunday instead of Saturday , had whispered sulkily with Mellen and White , during the night , and come to the conclusion that to work on Sunday was wrong . All of us , he told the captain , should observe Sunday with him and Mellen and White . I knew , as well as I knew my own name , that he was just being contrary . Captain Dean shook his head wearily . " Mr. Langman , " he said , " I have no intention of attempting to speak for God , but you evidently have a personal God that differs in some respects from mine . My God accepts those who worship Him , regardless of whether they worship on Greenwich time or on Cape Porpoise time . " " That 's blasphemy , " Langman said quickly . " What 's blasphemous about it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he likes , " Captain Dean said . " In good weather we 've always observed the Sabbath on my ships in a fitting manner , provided the weather made it possible for us to do so.  | " But if a storm happened to hit us on Sunday , we did anything necessary for the welfare of the ship . " You 've insisted for days that our lives may depend on this boat because the full-moon tide may force us off . " Very well , Mr. Langman . I think I can speak for God . I think I can say you 'll be forgiven for working on Sunday , just as God would forgive you for eating a seal on Friday , if you were a Catholic  --  and if we were so fortunateas to kill a seal . " So you 'll take your turn hauling plank , Mr. Langman , and so will Mellen and White , just as if it were Saturday , which it is . " " That 's more blasphemy , and it 's still Sunday , " Langmaninsisted . Swede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I wish he had . A smooth piece of ledge , sprinkled with boulders , lay just above the seaweed fringe . This ledge sloped easily toward the seaweed fringe and ended between two rock fingers . That rock was our shipyard , - our launching stage , our naval storehouse . Our only tools were our pocket knives , Chips 's hammer , the caulking mallet and the cutlass . Our only shipbuilding materials were the remnants of the Nottingham . With Chips 's hammer we had strained our muscles to draw nails and spikes from the few wet planks we had recovered , but we had failed so lamentably that our chief reliance for putting the boat together were the nails and spikes salvaged from Chips 's workbag.  |p129While  those of us able to walk dragged timbers , planks , canvas and cordage to the launching stage , the captain and Swede undertook to make the cutlass into a saw  --  a task that would never , I thought , be accomplished except by the direct intervention of Mercury , Minerva and another half-dozen Greek divinities like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Neither Mercury nor Minerva , however , had a helping hand in the transformation of the cutlass . Chips thought of the way it could be done , but was too weak to do anythingexcept advise us in our labors . He had come down with the same sort of sickness that had finished Cooky Sipper . Being a heavy man , the blisters and ulcers on his feet and legs were worse than ours , and he could n't stand upright . So he stayed in the tent , while Captain Dean and Swede worked beside him on the cutlass . His voice was weak and choked with phlegm , as Cooky 's had been , and he found difficulty in making himself heard above the everlasting slashing and crashing of the breakers . The captain and Swede brought sharp-edged rocks into the tent . While Swede held the blade of the cutlass at an angle against the sharp edge of a rock as a man holds the blade of a razor at an angle against his cheek , the captain would smash at the blade with a similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cutlass blade . They started with a nick at the hilt end , a nick at the point and a nick halfway between each of the three nicks . Then they subdivided each space between the nicks until the blade became a series of jagged saw teeth . Then Swede took one of those chisel-like rocks andp130Chips took another , and they rubbed and rubbed at each nick until both sides had beveled edges and the teeth were sharp . When they started I did n't believe they could do it . Since Boon Island , I believe the right sort of man can do anything . Even less than I believed a saw could be made from the cutlass did I believe that a seaworthy boat would emerge from the materials at hand , but we did build it , even though we had less with which to work than strolling players would need to build a stage in a barn . In spite of all our handicaps , we had something to hearten us , for on this day mussels in quantity  --  though little different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the western pools and indentations . Early in the afternoon , at low tide , Captain Dean and George White left the shipyard to patrol the island for scraps of wreckage and our daily repast of seaweed and ice . The captain carried his broomstick with the saucepan handle wrapped to the end by rope yarn and strips of linen . In cutting seaweed , they uncovered a pool in which a mussel was attached to the hard-packed mixture of shell and rock fragments that lay at the bottom of all such depressions . It was one of the big mottled sea mussels , unlike the clean blue ones that grow in beds on gravel spits near the mouths of rivers . This one was an old , old mussel , survivor of countless storms such as those through which we had passed  --  survivor , too , of the crashing blows of countless millions of breakers , exactly like those that had thunderedp131in our ears for six long days and nights  --  or was it five  --  or was it seven , as Langman said ? Even in the writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory . The days seemed endless : the nights were a torment of aching cold , of fear , of trepidation  --  ah , those nights , with the breakers thundering at our very shoulders ! Always , in the night , I had thoughts of eternity : of death , and of never ending punishment that might continue forever , forever , forever , forever . . . No wonder our companions cried aloud to God so frequently ! No wonder Langman thought Saturday was Sunday ! No wonder I must so often go back to the calendar I reconstructed with the help of Captain Dean and Neal Butler . Sometimes even the captain could n't remember , and both of us had to rely on Neal 's proficiency as a " quick study . " Old as the mussel looked , however , it was unquestionablya mussel , and a mussel is food , no matter how overgrownand thickened it is with pink and gray encrustations , with sprigs of seaweed . Captain Dean prodded at it with the stick to which the saucepan handle had been lashed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it grew , White snatched it from the water . So Captain Dean and White , crawling to other pools , raked the weed back from the edges . In the end they uncovered thirty-nine . A few were young and blue : mostly they were ugly , encrusted , ancient . The captain said he and White could have got more ifp132their hands could have stood it ; but the pain that results from repeatedly immersing hands in icy water , even when the immersion is momentary , is such as to agonize the most hardened sailorman . It ca n't be borne . When White and the captain returned , the captain held his hands behind his back , White doled the mussels into them one by one , and the captain passed them around , picking us at random , so that there was no way of telling who would get which mussel . There were three apiece , repulsive-looking , lumpy , with hard , mottled fungus growths upon them , and with a sort of beard attached to one end . We opened them by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blade around through the hinge . In spite of their looks , they seemed savory enough to us  --  once we had learned how to rid them of the infinitesimal pearls with which they were infested . The pearls could only be removed by squeezing them out ; by rubbing the meat between the tongue and the roof of the mouth . Certainly I have never wanted another mussel since those days , but they gave our seaweed a fishy juiciness wholly lacking when the seaweed was eaten alone . Langman , protesting that in all likelihood they were poisonous , for a time refused to eat them ; but when he saw Mellen and White swallowing them avidly , he ate them too , sneering at all of us . I think they must have given us a little strength , for after I had choked them down I returned more hopefully to my labors on that hopeless boat . For the bottom of the boat we stretched an oblong of canvas fiat on the sloping rock , weighting each corner withp133a boulder so it could n't blow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fastened together , but fastened in a way that would have sickened a savage from the heart of Africa . The ends of those planks were jagged . We had no way of rounding them off except by smashing them with a hammer , since the saw was too precious to waste on anythingtrivial ; so all that day was spent in getting ready to build rather than in building , and  --  seemingly most importantof all  --  in endless discussions as to who should go in the boat if ever it was finished.  |p134Even  Saver and Graystock , those lumps of men who would n't pick oakum unless they felt like it , and Chips Bullock , who was willing to work but could n't , wanted to be in that boat when she was launched , if she ever was launched . Probably this was because today , our first Sunday , the captain discovered , on the snow-covered fields of the mainland , moving specks that must have been people  --  churchgoers , in all likelihood . I think by that time we were all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hoping to catch the attention of those far-off specks  --  and surely there was n't a one of us who did n't know that we , all brown and gray , with grizzled beards and wrappings of oakum , could be no more apparent to those on shore than a seal would have been . But the sight of those moving specks upon that distant slope made each of us conscious of how near we were to bread and meat , to warmth and drink and other people , to houses and soft beds and dry clothes , to salves for ourp135festering feet and the sores on our knees and hands ; so even before the floor of the boat was completed , all but a few were urging that they be allowed to go ashore in her . Two exceptions were Swede and Neal . Swede did n't say it openly , but he was determined Neal must be saved , if anyone was . And equally apparent was Neal 's determinationnot to leave his father . I sympathized with Swede . If I had the say as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked Captain Dean first and Neal second : the captain because he was strongest and would have influence on shore : Neal because he was youngest and with the greatest possibilities . But I never would have picked Swede . His feet were so crippled that I considered him useless  --  which eventually taught me never to underrate a determined man , no matter how helpless he may seem . Even poor Chips Bullock argued his case to the captain in a faintly raucous voice , pleading that without his hammerand his nails and spikes , the boat would have been impossible . The captain said , " Yes , Chips . We 'll do the best we can . " Graystock and Saver , useless as they were , united in saying they deserved a place in the boat because of their physical condition , which was bad . Strangest of all the arguments was that of Harry Hallion , who said he thought he ought to go because he spoke Indian . " Indian ? " Captain Dean asked . " What kind of Indian ? " " Nova @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an Indian woman all one winter . " " Nova Scotia Indians are Micmacs , " Captain Dean pro/tested . " The Indians around here are a different breed . In the winter they live in the woods  --  and that 's one place we 're not going when we get ashore . " He never said " if we get ashore . " He always said " when we get ashore . " Becoming suddenly angry at all this pretense , the captainordered all those not working on the boat to return to the tent and pick more oakum  --  more oakum  --  more oakum . " There 'll be nobody go in this boat , " he shouted , " unlesswe can plug every hole with oakum . Right now she looks as though she 'd have more holes in her than she 'll have wood . " Repeatedly , that day , we stopped working on the boat and went to the tent to help in the picking of oakum  --  not only because of the intense cold , but to consult with Chips Bullock as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the floor boards . The glimpse we 'd had of those people on shore must have made each one of us , even the captain , worse than desperate ; for he took out a piece of black oakum from next to his skin . He let us feel the oakum . " Is it dry ? " he asked us . " Feel it ! " He passed it around . Swede and Neal and I said that to us it still felt damp ; but all the others , Langman included , pretended to find it dry . Langman was always wrong , and the captain knew it , but this time he wanted to take Langman 's opinion . So he took a pinch of gunpowder from the canvas pouch , produced his useless pistol and cocked it ; then did what he 'd already done a thousand times  --  put powder in the pan , wrapped the lock and the pan with the oakum , snapped the flint . . . snapped it : snapped it : snapped it , over and over.  |p137We  could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tantalizing odor of tarry scorching . There was even a faint hint of smoke . He kept on pulling the hammer back and snapping it ; pulling it back and snapping it . Then he passed it to Langman , who did the same . Then Langman passed it to me , and I tried and tried . All we got was a faint wisp of tarry-smelling smoke . Another thing I learned to dislike on Boon Island were the wiseacres who are forever saying , " Where there 's smoke there 's fire . " At Oxford I often heard Latin-speakingdons  --  the worst kind  --  throw that remark at each other . Flamma fumo est proxima . Where there 's smoke there 's fire . It 's not so ; but there 's no more use arguing with people who quote that saying than there would be in wrangling with the old Roman who is credited with first uttering it . The old Roman is dead : the others nearly so . " Where there 's smoke , there 's fire , " indeed ! I 'd have liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since this was Sunday , we held services in the tent . CaptainDean led us in a prayer that thanked God for His mercy in letting us stay alive ; that thanked Him for granting us ice to chew and mussels to eat ; that implored God to let us be seen from the mainland ; that begged Him to send a ship near this dreadful rock . All of us repeated his words in a hoarse and shivering chorus  --  all except Langman and White and Mellen , who , having decided the day was n't Sunday , refused to pray with us . I think , though , Langman was somehow helped by those Sunday services , in spite of being so certain that our Sun/day was the wrong one ; because when Neal and I made our last patrol of the day at dead low tide , around three o'clock in the afternoon , Langman came with us , and so did George White . They helped us in our daily search for mussels , so that we were able to bring back eight for each man.  |p139I  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to die for no sin of his own : then is half promised a reprievethat never arrives . Seven oars for seven men we 'd planned for the boat , and a longer steering oar . In order to make them we had to saw planks to the proper length : then split the planks with the sharpened rocks Chips Bullock had discovered . That was a labor undertaken by Neal and Swede and me while the captain and Langman planned the fastening of the boat 's sides . The cutlass-saw was the instrument we used to saw those planks ; and for incarnate devilishness that saw was perfectly designed to plague persons already plagued to the limit of endurance . The handle was too small to allow the use of both hands ; and the starting of a cut with those jagged teeth was a trial . All the wood was wet , and there seemed to be no way of holding the planks firm . We succeeded at last , after a fashion , by wedging one end of the plank beneath a boulderand forcing the opposite end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the plank , would haggle at it , always drawing the saw toward himself , until enough wood had been gnawed away to allow the plank to be broken . We called the different days of the week by the names of occurrences , and I thought for a time that this day would be called Oar Day  --  the day before having been our first Sunday , and the day before that Boat Day , and the day before that Tent Day , and the day before that The Day We Cut Off Our Boots , and the day before that Cooky Sipper 's Day . But our labors on the oars were dwarfed by a discovery made by the captain . At dead high tide , around ten o'clock , the captain raised a hoarse shout and pointed off to the south with his oakumwrappedhand . Beyond the breakers , beyond the round seal heads that watched us and watched us , were the sails of three vessels . They might have been fishermen or coasting schooners , but at least they were vessels  --  the first sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had felt sure that no fishermen would venture out of port at this season of the year , they were a sight that sent through me a choking surge of hope . They were moving straight out from shore , to the eastward , probably out of Portsmouth , the captain said : taking provisions to the Isles of Shoals , perhaps , or going for cargoes of salt cod . Again everyone crawled from the tent to see those three wonderful sails , and to wave their arms and halloo hoarsely . The three vessels looked to us to be about nine miles from us , but still we hallooed . No shout can be heard at a dis/tance of nine miles . All of us knew that . Perhaps our shouts were a form of prayer . When the sails , sliding gradually to the eastward , becamedim specks on the horizon , the oakum pickers crawled back to the tent . They looked like sick bears , and felt , if I could judge by my own feelings , even sicker than they looked . Neal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The task before us seemed insurmountable  --  as impossible , almost , as drilling a hole through a block of granite with a needle.  |p142Those  oars , I thought , were the most troublesome thing about the boat  --  though I suppose that each part of every enterprise always seems most difficult and most important to the one to whom it 's entrusted . Nonetheless , the oars seemed vital , for unless the wind was in the east , we could n't depend on our sail to carry us to the nearest land , which , if Captain Dean 's reckoning was correct , was six miles away . Even under favorable circumstances  --  better circumstances than the bitter ones we had so far encountered  --  we would be three hours , at least , rowing that clumsy boat to shore . And row we must , not only to get the boat across that turbulent stretch of water , but to keep ourselves moving so we would n't freeze . Yet the oars , split with rock-wedges from boards , were the same width from end to end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothed , so that men could use them effectively . The saw was useless to smooth those sharp edges . Our knives made no impression upon them , for thep143wet boards only roughened when we tried to bevel the corners . The best we could do , in the end , was to knock the ice from a ledge and rub each oar against the rock , working the oar around and around , rasping at it until we brought it to some faint semblance of smoothness . I could n't let myself think what such oars would do to the hands of those who paddled with them , even when the hands were padded with oakum . Tide was high at eleven ; so at daybreak , before we went to work on those devilish oars , Neal and I patrolled the island . The wind , for a change , was in the south and the seals had moved around to the north side . For a change , too , there were four gulls at high-water mark , wailing dolorously . One was eyeing something , first from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ; and as we made our way toward it , the gull picked up the something , flew straight up with it : then dropped it on the rocks , so that we knew it was a mussel . When we shouted and waved our arms , the gulls flew away , mewing . Neal picked up the mussel , broken by its fall , and divided it with me . As he chewed at that orange-colored meat , spitting out seed pearls as he did so , he moved from me to stare off to the westward , where low , shelving ledges made an easy descent to the rising waves . I followed the direction of his gaze , and my eyes caught what his had caught  --  a short stick , a trifle bent , standing up straight from those shelving ledges . There was something about the curve of that stick thatp144filled me with an almost insupportable excitement . I knew it could n't be what it vaguely resembled ! It could n't be ! Such things happen only in the Odyssey , and through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick as we hurried toward it as rapidly as our bandaged and aching feet would let us . Neal crawled out on the seaweed . I held his arm while he reached for the stick . It was exactly what it had looked like the moment we saw it . It was an axe helve , and on the end of it , yellowed with salt-water rust , was the axe head , with the honemarksstill showing on the still sharp blade ! It 's amazing how small a thing can make such a difference to so many people ! Without that axe we were almost helpless , though I think we were never wholly hopeless . With the axe , our spirits rose , our work no longer stood like an impenetrable wall before us . We shouted the news of the axe to Captain Dean and Langman : showed it to those in the tent , to raise their spirits . They passed it from hand to hand . " That 's mine , " Chips said . " The nails are mine , too . I ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He was the only one who did n't know how sick he was . " We 'll need that oakum tomorrow , " I reminded them . " If we have the right wind but should n't have enough oakum , we would n't dare to put her in the water . " Everyone , even Saver and Graystock , struggled to soften pieces of cordage , to separate the strands , to pick the hemp apart . We went back to the oars.  |p145With  Neal holding each board upright , wedged betweenrocks , the axe chipped smooth slivers from the corners of the planks . The portions to be gripped by the hands of the rowers became round . Neal and I exchanged places at intervals , for the sake of warmth ; but I think the thing that kept us warmest was the feeling of miraculous accomplishment.  |p146The  boat was shaped like a punt , with square ends and square sides , and we spent all day putting the final touches on her  --  if anything about that boat could be called final . She was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how high she 'd ride in the water when seven men were in her ; nor was there any way of knowing how our caulking would hold . All day long we drove oakum between the stern board and the sides : the bow boards and the sides . The floor boards had been laid on canvas ; and when they had been caulked as well as we could do it , the canvas was drawn up around the sides and ends like a shroud . We stretched canvas over her bow and stern , binding the canvas with cordage . " It might be , " Captain Dean said , " that if waves start slapping us , that canvas may help to keep out some of the spray . " Her height was a little increased by running a long strip of canvas around her , fastened to the stanchions ; but it was too low . It had to be , so that the men who knelt in the boat could use the oars as paddles.  |p147Remembering  now how that boat looked , I ca n't believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Today I would n't trust such a travesty of a craft to get me across the Isis at Oxford , but it 's easy to forget what a man will do when he 's faced on the one hand with certain death , and on the other hand with a chance to live . The easiest thing to say is that we were insane because of the things we 'd endured . Surely I was insane , because I was eager to go . I was even sorry for Swede and Chips , who were n't strong enough to do so , and for all the others who could n't for lack of space . Yet we were n't wholly demented , because we made half a dozen bailing scoops  --  a simple matter now that we had the axe , though without the axe it would have been beyond our powers . And we spent the last hours , right up to dark , in clearingseaweed-covered boulders from the narrow passagewaydown which the boat would have to be pushed in order to reach the sea . So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this strange boat down on such a boulder , we 'd have small chance of saving ourselves . We spent those hours , too , in cutting seaweed to floor the ledge on which the boat rested , and to cover all the interval down to the growing seaweed . Without that protection , the canvas shroud on which the floor boards had been laid would have been cut to ribbons on barnacles by the time we got her to the water . As we cut the seaweed , we ate as much of it as we couldstomach ; for the tide , high at noon , had shut us off fromthe mussel pools that were reachable only at low water . In the tent , that night , I may have slept a little , but onlya little , because of the excited discussions as to when thep148boat should be launched . Sometimes my hearing blurred , and there seemed to be breaks in the talk . This , I suppose , was sleep , for when my ears snapped open , someone , always , was talking . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour after noon , and low again at two hours after dark . What , then , was it best to do ? To start at dawn , when the ocean might be stillest ? No : there was the great stretch of seaweed to be crossed at low tide , and the danger of falling ! Yes , but over against that was the hazard of arriving at our destination when the tide was high , concealing perilous ledges and possibly covering beaches that might , at low tide , be reached even though the boat were swamped . To start at flood tide , then ? That would mean that the tide would be falling when we reached our destination , and that offshore currents might push us away . Ah yes , but beaches would be exposed  --  more safely approached . Offshore ledges would be revealed  --  more readily skirted . Some argued for starting on the half-risen tide in the morning . Langman in the beginning argued against all starting times that were proposed , and in the end argued for all of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that happened , and dodge the responsibilUty for anything bad . The world is full of people like that , but most of them have n't Langman 's malice.  |p149The  day , to the amazement and delight of all , was better for our purpose than any we had so far seen , though bitter cold . The sun rose red but unclouded , and there was a glassy sheen to the sea . On the north shore there were breakers , though not bad ones . On the south shore the swells came in from both directions , to gurgle , hiss and sigh along the brown seaweed-covered fingers of ledge , but for the most part they surged in without breaking to spend themselves in foam . The captain urged everyone from the tent at daybreak . " Tide 's dead low , " he shouted . " We 've got a lot to do today , so try to get enough mussels to last you through tomorrow . " I knew what he had in mind . He had n't liked the looks of that red sky in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hacking with our knives at those miserable mussels and chewing our hated seaweed , the captain said , almost diffidently , that he had been thinking about the boat and her launching . " I know we made seven oars , " he said , " but I 've comep150to the conclusion that seven is too many to pack into a boat that size and shape , even when she 's well built . It seems to me that two would be better than seven . " When he would have continued , his words were drowned by a roar of protest . The loudest roar came from Swede Butler , but Lang11 an 's was almost as loud . " If only two go , " Swede cried , " you would n't take Neal , and it was Neal found the axe ! Without the axe you 'd still be working on that boat ! If anybody deserves to go , Neal does . " " It was my axe to begin with , " Chips rasped . " I need medical help . " " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Swede said . " It belonged to all of us , same as a seagull would belong to all of us if we could catch one . " Langman shouted , " You need n't think I 'm going to sit here like a bump on a log while the captain goes ashore all alone to spread the news about how he did n't wreck us on Boon Island on purpose ! No , sir ! I 'm going in that boat if anyone does ! " Captain Dean looked sick . " I still think seven is too many . Would you be willing to try it with just me alone ? " " Oh no ! " Langman said . " I have n't forgotten how you hit me with the loggerhead the night we went ashore ! I would n't want anything like that to happen again . " The captain looked at him intently . " I hit you because you 'd stolen supplies that rightly belonged to all of us . You were mutinous ! You planned to take the ship for yourself and White and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who 'd believe such drivel ! Just to make sure you do n't slander innocent men without giving ' em a chance to answer , I insist on takingp151White and Mellen . They 'll have fair play or I 'll know the reason why . " " In that case , Captain , " Swede said , " you 'll have to take my boy , and you 'll have to go yourself , because you 're captain . You might as well take two more . You 'll have to do a lot of rowing , and the best men we 've got are none too strong . " " It 's too many , " the captain repeated . " But if that 's the way you want it , Mr. Langman , I 'll fill the boat . I 'll take my brother because he is my brother , and I 'll take Mr. Whitworth because I promised his father I 'd share and share alike with him . " A chorus of complaint went up from Saver and Graystock , that wholly worthless pair , from Chips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could hardly get to his feet , from Christopher Gray the gunner and Harry Hallion . We crawled from the tent as fast as we could , and for once were grateful for the ear-filling rumble of the breakers , which kept us from hearing the brainless clacking of those we left behind . It was decided that when we slid the boat into the water at dead high tide , the captain and Neal Butler should be in her , while the rest of us waded in to hold her firm until she was free and clear . Then the captain was to pull in Langman , whereupon the two of them would hoist in the other four , with Neal steadying the boat with the steering oar . Those we were leaving , barring Chips , who could n't stand , came to the launching-ledge and crouched there , five unkempt specimens of humanity , all haggard and hairy . I suppose none of us , with the exception of Neal ,  |p152looked  better ; but we could use our hands and feet , whereasthose we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the captain said , and his eyes wandered from man to man of those sorry five , " pray for courage , and do n't stop moving . If we can reach shore , you 'll have help and warmth and food and decent clothing . " He seemed to search his mind for something more to say , could n't find it and so laid hold of the bow of the boat and started her down the seaweed-strewn ledge toward the water . I imagined I knew how he felt  --  empty inside , wrung dry by cold , hunger and the prospect of that long row to the mainland in this cranky contraption of driftwood and old canvas . " Where 's the axe ? " Langman asked . " Where 's the ham-mer ? " Swede shook a fist at him . " You do n't need the axe and the hammer ! " he cried . " You 've got to leave us some-thing ! " White stumbled up with both tools and gave Langman the axe . " Captain Dean , " Swede shouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The captain spoke mildly to Langman . " You might as well leave them . " There was something snake-like about Langlnan 's face , in spite of his black beard . He lowered his head and faced Dean defiantly . " They could n't use ' em , even if we left ' em , " he said . " Even if there was anything to use ' em on ,  |p153their  hands wo n't hold ' em . They 've got the saw . When we reach land we may need those tools to build a better boat . " Nobody answered . We were too intent on the long swells rolling toward us  --  on waiting for the large one , the third wave , after which we might expect two rollers that would be less troublesome . The captain raised his hand and shouted , " Now ! " " Push her in , " Langman cried . He dropped the axe in the stern , bawled at the captain to get aboard , and signaled Neal to climb in as well . White tossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the thick layer of seaweedwe had spread beneath her . Her bow floated and rose up . With the canvas strip we had stretched above her sides , she had only eighteen inches freeboard . We waded in with her , up to our knees , up to our middles . The shock of the water on my feet and legs was indescribable , because pain can not be described . Captain Dean , looking seaward , waved his arms wildly . " Hold her ! " he screamed . " Back her ! " Ahead of the boat I saw a long swell moving in from the south . On its crest were the heads of a dozen seals , all staringdown at me . " Pull her back ! " Captain Dean cried . " Pull ! " The boat was sluggish and immovable in my hands , and the icy water around my middle drove the wind from me . I had no strength to pull . I felt her rising and rising . I caught her gunnel to rise with her . She turned sideways and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face . I saw Captain Dean and Nealp154slide down against the gunnel , with oars tumbling all around them . I made a despairing , fruitless clutch at the axe , caught among the oars . Then the wave broke , the boat turned over and above me , and I was buried in a choking smother of foam through which I struggled while icy thoughts darted like needles in my brain . This was the end of it ! Our precious axe was lost again ; the hammer as well ; all the oakum we had picked so endlessly ; all the oars that had tortured us ; all the planks and boards so painfully and hopefully pieced together ; the stanchions , the canvas , the nails and spikes so arduously assembled ! Everything was gone  --  everything but life itself.  |p155Our  clothes froze that night , though we lay close together . Probably we had thoughts , in spite of the shudderings that racked all of us when we crawled back to the tent after getting ourselves from the water . If I did have thoughts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Langman for putting the axe in the boat . Nor can I remember what I thought when Swede came in alone , after we were bedded in our nest of dank oakum . " She 's gone , " Swede said . " Lock , stock and barrel . I tried to hold her , but the tide pulled her out and the waves broke her into a tangle . She floated off to the south . " He hunted for Neal and wedged himself down beside him . " It 's started to snow , " Swede said . " Thick : from the south . You could n't have made it ! " He said no more . In that frigid tent there was silence that was almost tangible , like a fog . Even Captain Dean lay there , staring up at the peak of the tent , above whichp156hung the canvas flag that had failed us as utterly as had all our puny but excruciating efforts . With the coming of daylight Swede pulled himself to the tent flap . " The snow 's stopped , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " He looked helplessly from the tent , made an effort to get to his feet , fell to his hands and knees . " It 's got to be scraped off the tent , " he said . " Why has it ? " Langman asked . " Do n't Eskimos make houses out of snow ? I say leave the snow on the tent . It 'll protect us from wind . " Swede rolled over clumsily to look at Langman . " Langman , " he said , " you 're a whoreson , beetle-headed , flapear'dknave ! You 're against everyone and everything , and you keep right on telling lies to try to prove you 're right . If we leave the snow on the tent and get more snow , the canvas will split , or it 'll fall down on us . Snow 's heavy ! And you talk about Eskimos ! " " Eskimos do live under snow , " Langman said defensively . " Why do n't you tell the truth ? " Swede snapped . " They live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  yes , and tools . We 've got none ! It 's thanks to you that we 're without tools . " Captain Dean got heavily to his feet . " Now , now ! " he said . " We 've got to live together . And Swede 's right . We 'll have to scrape the snow off the tent . If we do , maybe those on shore will see the tent and the flag against the snow . " " I do n't believe it , " Swede said bitterly . " If those ashore had their eyes open , they 'd have seen this tent and flagpole  |p157long  before now . They 're probably like most of the farmers where I come from  --  spend half their lives walking around with their heads hanging and their mouths open . Well , I 'm going to make ' em see us ! " " I say with all this snow , we ought to stay in the tent , " Langman said . " We 're all half frozen . We 'll slip in the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Dean said . " That 's exactly why we ca n't stay in the tent . We 're more than half frozen , and unless we keep moving , we ' will freeze . " " If they want to freeze , " Swede said , " let ' em ! They 'd probably be more help to us dead than alive ! " He crawled out into the snow , glittering white on the boulders and ledges , and bright blue in the shadows . Neal went to the tent-flap to join his father . We heard them scratching at the snow to dislodge it from the sagging tent sides . Then they set off slowly toward the ledge where we had built the boat . Since the tide was low at eight in the morning , the captainand George White and Langman and Christopher Gray went to the north side for mussels . We had nine apiece that day , with seaweed in place of bread and sauce and dessert . I think the loss of the boat had shocked all of us : first into a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swede 's openly contemptuous attack on Langman may have had something to do with waking us from our lethargy . Certainly there was rancor in the mind of everyone able to think  --  even in the minds of Langman 's cronies , White and Mellen . In all their faces I saw sullen fury at Langman 's folly in putting the axe and the ham/finer in the boat , and at his insolent insistence that he did so to let us build a better boat when we got to land . We knew that was n't so : knew that his seizure of the tools was unreasoning hoggishness on Langman 's part , and there was hot resentment against Langman , and an irritationagainst everything . I think that was why there was a general outcry against the mussels on the ground that they were too cold , too tough , too bitter , impossible to swallow , too hard on the bowels . There was even more unrest when Swede and Neal crawled back . Swede had found the tattered remains of two hammocks . Neal dragged in one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his mussels . " Look at these hammocks , " Swede said proudly . " Just what we need for a raft ! " Captain Dean peered from Swede to Neal and back again . " Just eat your mussels , Swede , " he said . " You worked hard to save that boat . There 's plenty of time to discuss a raft . " " Oh no , there is n't , " Swede said . " I 've already lost the use of my feet , but I can still use my hands . I may lose them any minute . We 'll have to build the raft before I lose my hands too . " A groan went up from the circle of scarecrows huddled in the tent . " We 'd work ourselves to death , " White protested , " and have the same thing happen that happened to the boat . " " No , " Swede said . " It would n't be anything like the boat , because it would n't be overloaded , and I would n't launch it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swede , " Captain Dean said , " let 's talk this over some other time . "  | " Some other time  --  when my boy and all the rest of you are dead ? " Swede said politely . " No ! I 'm building a raft while I 've got my hands . If nobody else helps me , Neal will . " Harry Hallion spoke up . " He wo n't help you much when it comes to spiking her together . We used all our spikes on the boat . If there 's any left in the junk , he 'll never draw spikes without a hammer ! What 'll he use ? His teeth ? " " We 'll build it without spikes if we have to , " Swede said . " We 'll lace it together with cordage . " " On a raft , " Captain Dean said , " a part of you would be in water most of the time  --  all the time , maybe . The nearest land is six miles away . How long would you last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " Swede said , " but I prayed to God yesterdaywhile I was trying to hold the boat . I prayed again this morning . I prayed to Langman 's God , whose Sunday is Saturday , and to our God , whose Sunday is Sunday  --  to Langman 's God , who wants us to observe Christmas the day before Christmas , and to our God , who does n't care when we observe it , so long as we celebrate it with an understandingof what Christmas means . Both Gods told me what to do . They told me to build a raft . " I realized suddenly what Swede was saying . He was saying that God gave his only beloved son to save the world from itself . Now Swede , having communed with that God , was willing to give himself in order to save his only belovedson from a cruel and lingering death . He was not only willing to give himself : he had , in his mind , already done so.  |p160This  was the day of the seagull  --  a Langman Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day we started the raft . In making the boat we had deliberately ignored the foremastyard , not only because of its awkward length  --  twenty-four feet , a veritable tree  --  but also because it was so tangled and cluttered with the innumerable confusing attachments of such a spar that by general agreement it had been spurned by all  --  passed over after one look at the tattered shreds of canvas still clinging to it , and its wrappingsof frayed and frozen preventer stays , lanyards , bowlines , bridles , sheets , lifts , yard tackles . Just that yard alone was enough to turn me against ships , and I wondered why three-masted square-rigged vessels were ever made in the first place . I asked Captain Dean , as we dragged it to the spot chosen by Swede ; but he did n't know . " Probably , " he said , " we build square-riggers because nations like France and England have to fight wars every few years . To fight wars you have to have warships ; andp161warships have to carry a lot of men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schooner or a big brig , both easy to sail , there would n't be anything for sailors to do between fights , so they 'd make trouble like Langman  --  mutiny , probably , or die of boredom . To keep ' em busy you 've got to have a hundred sails for ' em to set or take in every half hour , and five or ten thousand sheets and lifts and tackles for ' em to haul on at five-minute intervals . " He cogitated : then added , " Maybe shipbuilders are like Langman . Maybe they get a foolish idea in their heads , and ca n't recognize a better one when it 's presented to ' em . " Swede and Neal had been at that spar since dawn , pounding the ice and snow from it and its attached junk . " I 've got it all figured out , " Swede told Captain Dean . " First we 'll sharpen up our knives and cut through each piece of cordage on the top side . Then we 'll roll the spar over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cordage free . All that cordage is slushed with tar , so the short pieces can be burned later , when you get fire . " When we got fire ! Ah , would that day ever come ! Captain Dean nodded . " If we start at the center when we strip the junk , two of us can start knifing a groove around the middle . We 'll hammer our knife-blades with rocks . Maybe we can cut an inch-deep groove all the way around . That 'll leave only a ten-inch cut to be made with the saw . " I suspected irony and glanced at him quickly , but he was serious enough . A ten-inch cut through that tree trunk of a spar ! And with a saw made by pounding a cutlass into jaggedness against the sharp edge of a ledge ! I tried to figure thep162amount of sawing we 'd have to do in order to make that yard into a pair of logs . If Langman had n't lost the axe , two men whose hands were n't frost-nipped might , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . But without the axe  --  with the saw alone : that miserable saw which would only cut when pulled backward  --  that was different ! Would two men make half an inch an hour ? Not through the thick part of the yard , they would n't . Perhaps when they were nearly finished , and the yard could be balanced on a boulder , so the blade would n't bind in the cut , they might make half an inch in an hour . Perhapsthey might . In any event , half an inch an hour was the best we could expect  --  and with ten inches to go , we 'd be twenty hours making the cut . But there were only nine hours of daylight in each day , provided there was no snow or rain : provided the wind was n't so piercing that working in it was impossible . And how many of us , afflicted with Burry sores and partly frozen hands and feet , were capable of using that saw at all ? " Clear away the junk in the center , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then I 'll start the groove . Neal can hold the knife . I ' 1l do the hammering . " In the face of Swede 's excitement , I banished my doubts about our ability to sever that detested spar . If Swede 's faith was so unconquerable , I could have faith too . I went to work on the twisted cordage . It resisted my knife-blade like strands of metal . " Take it a strand at a time , " the captain said . " Wrigglep163your knife-blade under a single strand : then drag the blade toward your stomach . " There were eight of us working at that spar , and we must have looked like hairy bears , nosing at a log in hungrycuriosity . Langman came from the tent to watch us . In his hand he held the saucepan handle we had salvaged in the distant past . " Get your knife and go to work , " Captain Dean said . " It 's Sunday , " Langman said . " Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What excuse will you have tomorrow for not working ? " " Tomorrow 's Christmas , " Langrnan said , almost indulgently . He seemed disappointed when the men on both sides of the spar made no reply . He had to have attention , Langmandid ; and he did n't care how he got it . He left us , slipping and sliding across the wet seaweed toward the mussel pools on the south shore . The tide was low . I hoped Langman 's respect for his private Sunday would n't prevent him from hunting food for the rest of us  --  though the mere thought of mussels almostmade me retch . Gradually we gained on the cordage and junk , half numbed by the clack , clack , clack of Swede 's rock as he rapped it against the back of the knife-blade that Neal clutched . Into that monotonous clacking , suddenly , intruded an uproar as startling as it was unexpected . Shrill through the noise of the breakers came a raucous screaming thatp164brought us up all standing . Against the dark background of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings that gyrated and flapped and rolled about . " It 's Langman , " Captain Dean said . " He 's caught a sea-gull ! " He had indeed , or the seagull had caught him , for the big bird was screaming , squalling , flapping its wings , beatingLangman 's head with giant pinions . I thought for a moment that the gull had lifted him from the rock . But the gull fell at last and Langman leaped upon it , and we saw he was beating it with the saucepan handle . At last the gull ceased to flap and flop , and lay still . The air above the man and the struggling bird had been alive with gulls , wheeling , squealing and wailing ; but when the bird was quiet , every last one of those gulls fell silent and winged off toward the mainland as if terror-stricken . Not one remained behind . There was something oppressive about the sudden departure of all those noisy creatures whose screams had shrilled through the roaring of breakers from dawn to dark each day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird across the icy ledges , and threw it down beside the spar . " There ! " Langman said . " There 's some food that 's better than mussels ! " He was proud of himself , and with good reason . We crowded around that enormous gull , fondling it , burying our fingers in its beautiful warm white breast , and sniffing its dusty clean smell . It was a black-back  --  snowy white on belly , head , neck and tail , but with black wings and a black saddle : largest of all gulls ; almost twice thep165size of ordinary large gulls with pale blue backs : nearly three times that of young gray ones . " I 'll skin him , " Langnian said importantly , " and we 'll eat him . I wish you could have seen how I got him . I cut enough seaweed to cover me , and then I raked up a mussel and put it on a flat place , right near the hole I 'd picked to squat in . Then I hung the seaweed all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that old gull came overhead , twisting his neck and squinting at that mussel from all sides , he looked as big as a goose ! Yes , sir ! Then he stuck out his feet and came down all sprawling , a regular ostrich , and I just put out my hand and grabbed him . That was the surprisedest gull that ever landed on this island ! " For a moment I almost liked Langman  --  almost forgot his effort to oust Captain Dean ; his almost certain plot to seize the Nottingham ; his insistence that Captain Dean had purposely wrecked the ship ; his stubborn refusal to admit the well-established fact of Sir Isaac Newton 's reflecting telescope ; his willingness  --  eagerness , even  --  to blacken CaptainDean 's reputation and by implication to damage the reputation of all who sided with the captain ; his persistence in observing the wrong Sunday . Yes , for a moment , but only for a moment , I forgot that persistence in wrongheadednessis the most dangerous of all human failings . Langman skinned that gull with loving care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and running the cut all the way down the center of the back to the tail . " We can make ear muffs with this , " he said as he worked . " We can fasten feather pads inside spun-yarn caps , so that those who go out on patrol can have better protection for their ears and noses . We can make a pair of feather-lined gauntlets and take turns wearing ' em . "  |p166I  was amazed to hear such helpful thoughts from Langman . Sometimes it 's hard to remember that the leopard never changes his spots : that the most hardened criminal has endeared himself to someone , but is no less dangerous . Langman peeled the wings back to the first joint , leaving all the wing-feathers attached to the skin . When the skinning was finished , he had a rude square of feathers almost three feet long and three feet wide . " How 'll we dry it ? " he asked Captain Dean . " Tie it around Neal before it freezes , " Captain Dean said . " His skin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the rest of us . " So that was what was done . Swede took the big black and white skin and went with Neal to the tent , to be out of the wind . The division of that bird 's body among thirteen men was n't easy , and I was glad Langman turned over the task to Captain Dean . First the captain gutted it , finding two six-inch tommy cod in its gullet . The intestines and the small fish he placed on a board to freeze , along with the thigh joints , the wing joints , the thick neck , the feet , and the skull . " We can chew ' em later , " he said . Then he laid off the breasts , still warm , and cut them into thirteen lengthwise strips , taking a little from the long , thick center strips to add to the thin side strips . The men watched the division with jealous eyes , each one certain , after the manner of hungry men , that his was the smallest portion . Chips Bullock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so the captain called for Neal to take Chips 's portion to him.  | " Make him eat it , " the captain told Neal . Langman was derisive . " I suppose , " he said , " you do n't trust any of the rest of us to take that to Chips . " " I do n't even trust myself , " the captain said . When a man 's hungry , he does n't waste time thinking how meat tastes . There 's blood in it , and a little hope and a little strength . He just chews at it until it dissolves and trickles down his throat . Then he 's angry and desperate because there is n't more.  |p168Langman  , inflamed by his success in capturing the seagull , was at us all Sunday to celebrate that day as Christmas . Swede , equally determined to keep on with the raft while the weather was endurable , spoke to him sharply . " What is it you want to celebrate , Langman ? " he demanded . " Do n't you remember what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sluts and beggars and cripples gathered in front of church doors , all mealymouthedand pious , and their eyes rolled up , hoping they looked as if they were talking to God ? Remember , Lang-man ? " Langman , his lip curled , eyed him sideways . " Well , I remember , " Swede said . " When the church doors were opened and the alms and doles were handed out , all their piety disappeared and they fought each other like cats and dogs , each trying to get -. he others ' alms away from ' em . They 'd go off down the street , cursing and fighting , and push their way into public houses and get roaring drunk on gin ! " " You 're against Christmas ! " Langman said angrily .  | " There you go , " Swede said , " twisting things around ! I 'm not going to have any first mate telling me how to celebrate the birth of Christ , or when to do it . You say today is Christmas , but you 're wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my own way . " Captain Dean turned to me . " Miles , you were in Christ Church . You must have heard talk about the celebrating of Christmas . " " Yes , sir , and my father and I often talked about it . He said it should be a festival for children and for the poor  --  not a time for people to cripple themselves financiallyby exchanging expensive gifts that most givers ca n't afford and most recipients do n't want . He said Christ would be the first one to pity those who ca n't decide which day to celebrate , and to laugh at those who , because of politics , say how it shall be celebrated . " " That 's blasphemy again ! " Langman cried . " No , it 's not , " I said . " Every don in Christ Church knows that the Puritans by act of Parliament forbade merrimentor religious services on Christmas . They said it was a heathen festival . Charles II revived feasting on Christmas . That 's politics . " " Anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's not so , " I told him . " I 've heard professors lectureon it . Some of the ancients said Christ 's birthday was May 2oth : others said April 19th : still others put it on the seventeenth of November . One man held out for the twenty-eighth of March . Then January 6th was celebratedas his birthday for hundreds of years . " " I say this is Christmas , " Langman persisted , " and the rest of my seagull should be divided for a feast . "  | " All right , " Captain Dean agreed . " Go ahead and divide it up . You 'd better give Swede at least half of the neck . He seems to be doing most of the work on the raft . " The junk was completely stripped from the spar that Sunday noon , and we took turns using the cutlass-saw . The saw did n't really cut the wood : it abraded it : chewed it : wore it away . By noontime Langman had divided the body of the gull and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ callingour Christmas dinner . " We ca n't distribute this by lot , " he explained , " becausesome are better able to eat than others , and if I passed it out by lot , the wrong man might get the wrong thing and not be able to eat it . So I 've taken Captain Dean at his word : I 've gone ahead and divided it up . " Now take Chips Bullock . He ca n't eat much , and he ca n't hardly chew at all , so I 've given him the heart and the liver . Then there 's Graystock and Saver . They claim they ca n't work or walk or do anything to help us , so I 've given each of them one of the fish we found in the craw . The captain gets the two wings . There 's not much meat on the wings , but there 's some , especially when they 're pounded on rocks . The same thing is true of the feet . You might not think there was much in seagulls ' feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pulp ; and they last longer than plain meat when you suck at them , so I 'm giving Christopher Gray the feet . " I figure there 's about as much in one of the thighs as there is in two wings , so I 'm giving Henry Dean one of the thighs and Harry 1-lallion the other.  | " Then there 's the back : that has n't got much on it , but the bone is thin and can easily be pounded ; so I 've divided it into two parts and White gets one part and Mellen gets the other . " There 's a good deal of nourishment in the skull and in the neck , so I 've split the skull in two and cut the neck into three parts , one of them a little larger than the other two . I 'm giving Swede half the skull and one of the small pieces of the neck . " Whitworth gets the other half of the skull and the other small piece of neck . Neal gets the large piece of neck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bone and gristle . " That seems fair , " Captain Dean admitted . " What 's left for you ? " " Well , " Langman said , " I may seem to have a little more than some of you , but I really have n't . I 'm taking the windpipe and the intestines . They 're frozen ; and when they 're pounded up together , they 'll probably be about the same thing , in the long run , as a piece of neck  --  especially when they 're mixed with seaweed . " By the grace of God , when that cutlass-saw had chewed its way half through the spar , we lifted it and banged it against the edge of a ledge . To our triumphant amazement it cracked and split ; so that when four of us took one end and four took the other , and we put our weight on it , it broke all the way across  --  jaggedly , it 's true ; but it broke . So when we crawled into the tent for the last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side by side on the flat ledge , ready to be joined together in a raft  --  though my half-frozen brain was incapable of knowing how it could ever be done.  |p173December  25th , MondayChristmas on Boon Island ! I write the words reluctantly because they deny each other . They 're unreal and do n't belong together . Christmasbelongs with warmth , with love , with good cheer , with feasting , with happiness , with gratitude for years past and years to come , with an understanding of the meaning of Christmas ... . There were spittings of snow and a northwest wind that drove snow-dust beneath the tent and through every crevice , no matter how solidly we packed oakum along the tent-bottom . Swede , when he went out at dawn to work on the raft , crawled back in again , baffled . " The wind 's so cold the whole sea 's smoking , " he said . " That wind cuts like a knife . Let 's see that seagull 's breast . " He fumbled at the oakum wrappings that Neal , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and when he pulled out the beautiful black and white skin , it had lost its stickiness . It was n't dry , but it was flexible , like parchment.  | " If we could cut this apart , " Swede told Captain Dean ,  --  we might make protectors for our ears and noses . Then some of us could stand this wind .  --  The captain took the skin from him , stretched it over his knees and stroked it . " It 's a shame to cut that breast , " Swede said . " We could make a whole helmet out of it . " " Only a helmet for one man , " the captain reminded him . " What would do us the most good , " Swede said , " is to cut it into pieces to fasten inside our oakum mittens so our hands wo n't get numb . Of course , we ought to have some for our ears and noses . " Taking the skin from the captain , Neal pressed it tight over his head . He was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard ; and his face , beneath that soft , white gull breast , with the black wings hanging down on either side , reminded me poignantly of how he had looked on the stage at Greenwich , reciting Colley Cibber 's epilogue to The Walking Statue . He lifted the gull breast from his head and studied it . " If you take off the large parts of each wing , " he said , " you could run spun yarn through them and tie one over each ear . They 'd be big enough to protect your ears and your cheeks , too . " Langman took the skin from him and examined the wings . " What about the ends of the wings ? " he asked . " Well , " Neal said , " you could cut off the stiff quills and weave the feathers in and out of our oakum ear muffs . You could weave ' em in on a slant . They 'd cover your ears a little , and stick out over your eyes and nose and mouth . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mittens . The beautiful white breast , after long discussion and the drawing of diagrams on the skin with the points of knives , we cut into strips long enough to pass from ear to ear across the nose . At the base of the breast were the tail feathers . Captain Dean looked up at Langman . " This tail does n't fit much of anywhere , " he said . " How about giving it to Neal for a Christmas present ? " Langman sneered , but nodded his head in acquiescence . All that Christmas morning we wove and patched our oakum headgear and mittens with those strips of seagull skin . There were enough to make five feather-lined helmetsthat would let five men work at one time in the teeth of that northwest wind . The captain took the first helmet we finished . When he had clumsily tied it on with spun yarn , he said abruptly , " Low tide 's about now . We 've got to eat something ! That something 's going to be seaweed , and we ca n't stay alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seaweed , and when he returned , four more helmets were finished . We choked down the seaweed . Then Swede crawled on his hands and knees to the captain , to Langman , to George White , to me . All he did was take us by the shoulders and look into our faces ; but that was enough to shame the four of us into following him out into that searingwind . We had no hammer : no spikes : no nails . We had to build that raft out of four lengths of plank that Swede and Neal had somehow worried from the junk the day before . All we had to fasten the planks to the spars was rope thatp176could be cut into desired lengths and slapped against ledges until , freed of ice , they were flexible . We must , the captain explained , do everything with cordage , so he showed us how to haul cordage into place , thread it beneath the two pieces of spar in such a way that the pieces were four feet apart ; then bring the ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus the spars were joined loosely by a series of rope loops . Into these loops we thrust the four lengths of planks . Spun yarn was knotted from side to side of the loop and between the planks to prevent the planks from folding against each other . Then each loop was tightened as is a tourniquet . With one man on each end of a loop , a stick was thrust through the slack and twisted and twisted , until the loop was as tight as it could be made . When any one of us reached the limit of his endurance , which was often , he told Swede , who went back to the tent with him , helped him relinquish his feathered headgearto another , who crawled reluctantly into that whistling , spume-laden blast . Swede was the only one who had faith in what we were doing . The rest of us were helping him rather than ourselves . By dark of that Christmas Day the planks were laced in place : the tourniquets that held the lacing were fastened so they could n't slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop , and went from one of us to the other , patting our backs and thanking us for the work we 'd done , I had a momentary thought that Christmas was truly Christmas , even on Boon Island.  |p177Our  lives depended on the weather , and if that northwest wind had blown another day , if for another twenty-four hours the combers , each one whitecapped , had raced at us and all around us , steaming and smoking , as the sea always does in frigid spells , I think our work would have been wasted and our hopes dashed . But on the day after our true Christmas , the weather moderated . I may seem to speak overmuch about the weather  --  about the hours of high tides and low tides ; about the spring tides that threatened our lives and the neap tides that let us go farther out on the seaweed-covered rock fingers in our search for mussels ; about the snow or sleet that might crush our tent ; about the offshore winds that bit into our bones , and the south winds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our existence to the distant beaches that we sometimes saw , always fogged by mist from breakers . Yet weather was our life , and so must be explained to those who see weather with different eyes ; and to one whop178has been exposed to the ocean and its winter furies , the words " the weather moderated " bring inexpressible relief  --  a surcease from agony , from despair , from dark depression .... Londoners  --  city dwellers  --  who despise sailors and countrymen , can never in their ignorance know the beauty of those words , just as they can never know , in their restricted world , the marvels that exist in the worlds of others , or appreciate the magic qualities of all the things they look upon as commonplace : the wonders of fire , of sweet water , of shelter . In Greenwich we listened in amazement to those Londonerswho longed for and acclaimed cloudless skies at times when countrymen were praying for rain and losing their crops and even their farms from drought ; who were perpetually being caught in thunderstorms because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a narrow strip of blue sky in the east ; to whom a tree was merely a tree , and they unable to distinguish between a pine , a fir , a spruce or a larch ; to whom a bird smaller than a pheasant was merely a bird , without a name , without a song ... . Ah ! Fortunate , fortunate city dwellers : fortunate that so many countrymen and seamen are inarticulate , unable to express their thoughts concerning those who dwell in cities and are so profoundly lacking in knowledge ! And so , to our joy , the weather moderated ! The wind , what there was of it , could n't make up its mind what to do . It blew gently from the east : then came fitfully from the west . Swede , working at the pile of junk for materials to strengthen his raft , nosed at those breezes like a weather/vane . He was afraid , and so were the rest of us , that the wind would back up  --  move to the west and south without first going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a storm or a blow , the wind backs up , unpleasant weather will soon return , just as some sort of evil follows the appearance of a ring around the sun or around the moon . We stepped a fence post of a mast on the raft and hung the two hammocks on it , to serve as a sort of double lugsail . We fastened three pieces of wood  --  oars , we called them , and were too weak to laugh at ourselves  --  to the spars . Then , because Swede insisted we must , we lashed bridles to both ends of the spars , with long rope-ends trailing from them . At noon the tide was lower than ever before , because of the full moon , and we brought in a treasure trove of mussels . We left half of them unopened . There was something about that raft that sickened those who worked on it . Only Swede grew constantly more cheerful . " There 's got to be two little pulpits built up at each end , " he told Captain Dean . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : then lace the piles in position . That 'll keep us out of the water . They ought to be big enough so we can kneel on them . " " Who 's we ? " Captain Dean asked . " You and who else ? " " I do n't know , " Swede said . " The Lord will provide . " The captain shook his head and let his eyes wanderaround the horizon as if in hopes of finding the somethingthat the Lord would provide . He studied the tall rusty faceof Bald Head Cliff , the long sands of York and so on to theopen sea beyond . Then he straightened , as if incredulous . " Why , " he said , " there 's a sail ! There 's two of ' ern ! " He raised his voice shouting , " Sail ! Sail ! "  |p180We  dropped our armfuls of cordage . We got ourselves to the highest part of the rock and stared longingly at those two far-off sails . They seemed to be sloops , but they were so distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading : whether they were inbound or outbound . We could hardly see their hulls , but our unreasoning longing to be rescued was so strong within us that we shouted and waved , waved and shouted  --  all of us but Swede . When we stopped our waving and our shouting and just followed the progress of those small pink sails , Swede laughed at us . " You think I have n't got a chance to reach shore on this raft , " he said , " yet you go shouting and waving at two sloops that are fifteen miles away if they 're an inch . You 'd never have seen ' em at all if the wind had n't blown from the northwest all day yesterday . There is n't one of you that can see a man when he 's over six miles away . There is n't one of you whose voice could be heard a mile away . If that 's the way you feel , every last one of you ought to be fighting for the chance to go on this raft with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , and that our behavior in shouting and waving at those two far-off sail showed we were close to panic . Yet the sight of those sail , and our shouting and our waving , had done something to our spirits so that when we had finished Swede 's cordage pulpits , and went to the tent to eat our seaweed and ice , we were more hopeful about Swede 's venture than we had hitherto been . When he stayed behind us , brooding over his raft and talking endlessly to Neal , he put me in mind of a bridegroom , garrulous over the inescapable fate awaiting him on the morrow.  |p181Love  , true love , is , I suppose , always intemperate , whether it 's the love of a man for a woman , a woman for a child , or a father for a son . Certainly Swede 's love for Neal was a consuming passion , and equally certainly Neal 's comprehensionof that love was unusual and beautiful . Even before sunup Swede had left the tent , and Neal with him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a buoyant quality to his voice . When I went outside , I found the wind , wambling and uncertain the day before , had dropped to a dead calm  --  and when I say calm , I 'm speaking only of the wind . The canvas on the tent pole hung flat against it ; but the sea  --  ah , that damnablesea ! There may be such a thing as a dead calm around Boon Island , but it must be in the summer . When we were on the island , the sea was perpetually heaving , surging , on every side , as if afflicted with waves of nausea . If the breakers came at us from the west , the island seemed to catch them and pull them around , billowing , on either side , as a woman , battered by wind , draws a cape around herself.  |p182But  the air , at least , was still and frost-laden . There was frost on the seaweed : ice on the naked boulders  --  spume-ice left by the northwest wind . I went over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lashing two oars to the sides with spun yarn . " I know the signs , " Swede said cheerfully . " That wind 's coming around . When the tide 's low at one o'clock , she 'll move in from the south . No doubt about it . " " How 're your feet ? " I asked . " Gone , " Swede said lightly . " Would n't you feel better if we cleaned them ? " I asked . Swede shook his head . " I do n't want to see ' em , " he said . " I do n't want anybody else to see ' em . They do n't hurt , and if you did something to ' em , they might start hurting again . " The captain and George White crawled from the tent just as the sun came up . Against its rising disk the rollers on the horizon were like the teeth of our cutlass-saw . " Well , Captain , " Swede said triumphantly , " this is the day ! Full moon ! Onshore wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oakum-swathed hands dragged at the spar that formed one side of this spider-web of a raft , laced together with cordage . The spar pulled free of the ice beneath it . It was too frail a support for my taste . The two hammocks , rigged as sails on its stump of a mast , hung limp and ineffective , like the folded wings of a sleeping bat . " I 've made up my mind to one thing , " Captain Dean said . " If this raft sets off , I wo n't be on it . " " That 's your privilege , " Swede said . " I wo n't be on it , " Captain Dean said , " because I'vep183weighed the chances , and the chances of getting ashore alive with this raft are n't as good as staying alive on this rock . I ought to forbid you to go . Yesterday we saw two sail heading east . They must have come out of the PiscataquaRiver , making toward the Isles of Shoals . I 'd say they 're probably running out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need fresh fish . If they run out of fish in Portsmouth , they 're bound to run out in York , too , or Cape Porpoise , or some such place . Boats ' 11 put out of those ports , just as they put out of Portsmouth . " Swede put his arm around Neal 's shoulders and spoke to Captain Dean . " Captain , I 'm leaving here at low tide . You 'll help me put her in over yonder , where those ledges point out to the west , wo n't you ? " I was watching Neal . His eyes seemed to be examining the lashings of that strange raft . They lifted suddenly , met mine and instantly dropped again . They looked hurt , like the eyes of a dog whose master is deserting him . " Help me get seaweed , Neal , " I said . He climbed obediently from the raft , and as he went , his father 's fist rapped him affectionately on the shoulder . We skirted the tent and started that hated circuit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been sent to us by the sea 's grace . " Neal , " I asked , " has your father ever told you he 'd like you to go with him on the raft ? " Neal shook his head . " He would n't let me . I said I 'd go , but he almost snapped my ears off . " " He 'll never make it , " I said . " Have you asked him not to go ? " " No , " Neal admitted . " He wants to go . He 's determined to go . "  | " Yes , " I said , " I can see that . " " He might make it , " Neal said , " if he had an onshore wind and a strong man to use the paddle . Anyway , nothing can stop him . " He hesitated ; then added , " I do n't want to stop him . " When I was silent , Neal added , " When he was in the Naval Hospital , he thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pulling his weight , and he was ashamed to be seen in the hospital uniform . On the Nottingham he pulled his weight . He was happy again . He was even happy on this island  --  until his feet froze . Then he could n't pull his weight any more . He thinks this raft 'll let him pull his weight . " " Not if he does n't get ashore , " I reminded him . " He does n't look at it that way , " Neal said . " He says everything 's in his favor . He says somebody may see him if he gets halfway to land . He says if he gets almost to land , somebody 's sure to see him . He says if he does n't get to land and the raft does , they 'll find the raft  --  and then they 'll find us . " " You would n't stop him if you could , would you ? " I asked . " No , I would n't , " Neal said . " If he let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never forgive himself . He knows he 's going to die , and so do I. I do n't want him to die unhappy . Once he 's on that raft , headed for shore , his mind will be at ease , no matter what happens . " There was n't anything I could say to that . Neal , when I 'd first encountered him in Greenwich , was a fine boy  --  the sort of boy anyone would be proud to have as a son or a brother ; but the things that had happened to him inp185five months had changed him from a boy into a man  --  a man who would be a credit to any society , to any country , no matter along what lines his life might be cast . Swede was right about the wind . At noon it moved in faintly , a little east of south , and the captain gave the word to drag the raft to the spot Swede had chosen . The dragging was n't easy , and we did it by inches . Swede counted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George 's Light Dragoons  --  " One , two , three , hup , "  --  and at the " hup " we 'd all lift together . By " all " I mean the captain and Neal on one side with Langman and me ; on the other side Gray , Hallion , Mellen and White . The others could n't lift , they said , but they had crawled from the tent to watch , all but poor Chips Bullock . Between every few lifts we crawled forward to move rocks from our path , and came back to lift again , sliding the raft forward three inches , five inches . The hardest part was finding footholds sufficiently secure to make lifting possible . At the water 's edge the captain stepped back from the raft . " Put her in , " Swede shouted . " She 's headed right for shore ! " " Yes , put her in , " George White said . " I 'm going with him . With this breeze I think we can make it . " Langman , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face so covered with whiskers , had a smug look . If one of his own men had n't been going with Swede , I was sure he would have protested bitterly . He never would have gone himself , and he would have done everything possible to prevent Swede from going alone.  | " If you 're determined to go , " the captain said , " I wo n't try to stop you , now that you 've gone this far --  " " Push her in , " Swede said . " But I want to urge you to wait one more day , or two days . " " What for ? " Swede demanded . " Get her in the water ! " There were murmurs from the oakum-draped figures sprawled on the rocks around us , their limbs at odd angles , like those of dead men . The captain fumbled in his clothes and with difficulty produced coins , which he gave to Swede . " These are all I saved , " he told Swede . " They may help you , one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swede . When you get to shore , have somebody light a fire on the beach . Have ' em light two fires . Have ' em do that before they do anything else . " " Two fires , " Swede said . He crawled aboard the raft and swept us with a glance that made my heart contract . " I know you wish us well , " he said . " I wish all of you well . " He steadied himself by grasping the spar on either side , and we ran the raft into the water . George White climbed over the stern , and we pushed as hard as we could . The raft moved heavily between two ledge-fingers , and her hammock-sail flapped . She almost stopped , settled down as a wave receded , then picked up way again . She moved out until she was parallel with the tips of the ledgefingers : then sluggishly swung broadside to the distant coast line . A slow surge moved her forward . The bow rose a little . The surge slid back and left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White struggled with the lashings of his oar . The free side of the raft slipped under water . The surge returned  |p187and  the raft tilted sharply . Then another surge moved down from the north side of the island , pressed against the submerged side , and the raft rolled over . A crying rose around us like the squalling of seagulls above a school of fish . The raft had spilled in deep water . I found myself on a ledge-finger near the wallowing contraption . Swede came to the surface , gasping , and swam easily to shore , holding a rope-end in his hand . Neal and Langman dragged him up on the seaweed . I saw the captain , at the end of another rock finger , reaching and clutching for a piece of wood  --  White 's rude oar . He caught it and pulled . White 's head emerged from the water . I thought he was dead . The captain dragged him up on the ledge , hoisted him to his feet and held him by the waist , doubled over . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung to the oar . Swede , clutching his rope-end , seemed able to say nothing but " Help me ! Help me ! " in a voice that quavered so the words were hardly distinguishable . Incapable of using his feet , he straddled a seaweed-coveredboulder , pulling at the rope-end until others came to help . Between us we got the overturned raft into the cove and ashore at the spot from which we had launched her . " Help turn her over , " Swede gasped . " Turn her right side up ! " " You ca n't make it , Swede , " the captain said . " White 's finished . He 's full of sea water . He 's sick ! " " I 'll go alone , " Swede said wildly . " Turn her over , Captain . I 've got to go ! " " You ca n't go , you fool , " Langman said . " It 'll be dark  |p188before  you get ashore . You 'll freeze in those wet clothes . It 's too late . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'll never get a brighter night than tonight  --  full moon , no clouds , onshore breeze , high tide at seven ! Make ' em turn it over , Captain ! " " Not if you 're going alone , " Captain Dean said . Swede , on his knees , caught the captain 's hand . " Do n't do it for me ! " he implored . " Do it for these others ! " He swung an oakum-swathed hand in a semicircle to include all those stooped , bearded , wild-looking creatures . I was afraid to look among them for Neal . Harry Hallion shuffled across the slippery seaweed to stand beside Swede and the captain . " I 'll go with him , " he told the captain . " I can swim . White could n't . If Swede feels the way he does , I think we can make it . " The captain eyed him dubiously . " Anything 's better than this , " Hallion said . " You 're wasting time . Get her turned over for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him drag the raft from the water and turn her right side up . Swede , half sobbing and half laughing , scuttled among our legs like a shaggy dog , wanting to help , trying to help , but only succeeding in getting in our way . She slid up easily on the seaweed , and we turned her gently for fear of smashing her . The mast and the hammock-sailswere gone , but the pulpits had n't been dislodged . " Push her in ! " Swede shouted , and there was a terrible urgency in his voice . " We do n't need a sail ! Get her in before the tide turns ! " He rolled himself onto the raft , rose to his knees , un/knotted the lashings of the oar still fastened to her side , and shook the oar at us like a spear . We slid her into the water , and as she left the ledge Hallion crawled in with White 's oar . A swell from the south raised her . Miraculously she slipped down it , toward the mouth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to the west and she cleared the mouth of the cove , Swede and Hallion thrashing the water with their makeshift oars . Behind me someone prayed , the same incoherent prayer that had risen so often to my own lips  --  Oh God Oh God Oh God Oh God .. . I felt sick all over at the smallness of that miserable raft , the cold immensity of that heaving ocean , the far far frosty distance over which the raft must float , the seeming pitifulness of those two human specks  --  yet who was to feel sick when those two specks were in truth , and unknown to themselves , great in spirit , and therefore happy ! There was distance and haziness between the raft and Boon Island when Swede turned , raised his oar and waved it . I looked for Neal . He was n't among those who knelt on ledges or clung to boulders , following the slow movement of the raft with straining eyes , urging it on , urging it on . Neal would , I knew , have felt that same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tent . Neal was sitting beside Chips Bullock , holding one of Chips 's hands in both of his . " He was alive when I came in , " Neal said . " He held out his hand to me and I took it . He did n't say anything , but his eyes asked . I told him about the raft . I think it made him feel better . "  |p190Chi|ps  's eyes were closed . His face was peaceful , and I was glad he was gone . He had n't died alone in a hole on the rock , with someone who could n't speak to him , as he had feared he might if Langman , on Election Day , had become our captain . There was coming and going in the tent . At dusk , the captain said , the raft seemed to be halfway to land . Sometimesit would go from sight : then rise again on a wave . Nobody talked about it . We were exhausted . Also around high tide time , the wind rose and howled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surf made speech next to impossible for exhausted men.  |p191God  only knows why so many of us are unable to tell the truth about occurrences . A man is said to blench at a distressingsight , when in reality his color changes not at all . A lady , supposedly , swoons or blushes at a word she has heard her father and her brothers use a thousand times , whereas the swoon or the blush occurs only in the imaginationof the lady herself , or in that of the narrator of the incident . If a writer dislikes wine , all drinkers are drunkards , staggering and revolting . Those of whom we approve have smiling countenances and warm hearts : those of whom we disapprove are hyenas in appearance and behavior . If two nations are engaged in a war , the one we dislike is a land of beasts , brutes and matricides ; whereas we , to them , are bullies , murderers and patricides . Each nation is fighting a righteous war , brought about by the intolerable knavery of the other . Too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers would have us write . Perhaps most of us are not only incapable of seeing things truly , but never do . I think that when Captain Dean called me from the tentp192at dawn on the day after Swede and Harry Hallion had gone floating off on the raft , and Chips Bullock had died , he knew what that day would bring forth , and I think he was struggling desperately to find the inner strength to face it . Captain Dean was what is known as civilized . He recognizedand detested the bad days that selfish and greedy men , civil war , French influences , gambling , bad laws and worse law enforcement had brought upon England . On Boon Island he had willingly done physical things that those beneath him had n't the moral strength to do . He had endured without anger the cowardice of Saver and Graystock : the helplessness of his own brother ; the malicious opposition of Langman , White and Mellen . He had venturedout into the black cold of midnight in the hope of catching a seal unaware . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuaded his unwilling crew to pick oakum for their own protection : almost paralyzed his hands to dredge up mussels for us ; and now I think he foresaw that a worse trial was upon him  --  one that would require him to ignore standards that civilization builds up within a decent man . As I crawled from the tent , Captain Dean stopped to speak to the men . " We 'll make the full circuit of the island , " he said . " Tide 's high at eight . When it starts to fall , I want Chips 's body on the ledge nearest the tent . White , that salt water you swallowed yesterday has n't hurt you . You 're still the strongest  --  you and Langman . Drag out Chips 's body . Put it on the ledge . When Mr. Whitworth and I come back , we 'll say a prayer over it and roll it in the water . " He followed me out . The tide was higher than we hadp193ever seen it . The breakers , pounding and bellowing , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Captain Dean said . " There have been spring tides that washed right over this island . There must have been . " He looked back at the tent . There was no sign of movementwithin its sagging sides . We made our slow circuit of the island , watching for floating objects or anything usable cast up by the sea . There was nothing in sight  --  nothing except the seals that reared head and shoulders from waves to follow our every movement with insatiable curiosity : little black and white sea-swallows , skittering from wave to wave with limp feet trailing , and everywhere an infinity of sea ducks , swimming in vast shoals ; chunky round black ones with white cheeks : little slender brown ones with bristly combs , diligently raising pointed beaks to heaven and genuflectingto each other  --  and all complacently ignoring us . Our rounds completed , the captain peered intently toward the distant mainland , then glanced disconsolately toward the tent . " They have n't done as I told ' em , " he said . " They have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , " Go in yourself , Miles . I ca n't allow them to disobey orders like this . " I went to the tent and pulled aside the flap . Earlier , when I had crawled out , they were lying down , huddled together , as motionless as Chips Bullock . Now only Chips lay there . The others , even Saver and Graystock , were sitting up . I sensed a feverish excitement . " Why did n't you take Chips out ? " I asked . " The captainsaid to put him on the ledge . "  | " We have n't the strength , " Langman said . " We 're weak from lack of food . " I looked from one to another . Neal crawled out from among them and stood beside me . " They want to eat him , " he said . " They 're afraid to ask the captain . They want you to do it . " " I never said any such thing ! " Langman said . " I 'd never eat a fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at low tide , " I reminded them . " Mussels ! " Henry Dean exclaimed . " I gag whenever I try to swallow one ! " " Look , Whitworth , " Graystock said , " those mussels make every last one of us sick ! The captain 'll do whatever you ask him to do . Ask him to let us have Chips . There 's no use wasting him , the way we wasted Cooky ! " Well , there was no use lying to myself . When the captainrolled Cooky into the sea , I 'd almost protested  --  almost , but I had n't quite dared . I had n't let myself formulateclearly in my mind that there was no good reason why we should n't have eaten him . I stood looking from them to the body of Chips Bullock . I had no feeling at all except pity for Captain Dean . When he came in among us I said , " Captain , these peoplewant to eat Chips Bullock . " " Not me ! " Langman said . " Captain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . Mr. Langman killed it , and Mr. Langman ate a mouthful of it , like the rest of us . He was glad to get it and so were we. , , " What 's that got to do with it ? " Langman asked sharply . " It 's got this to do with it , " I said . " Gulls are scaven/gers . They eat anything dead . The one we ate might have eaten part of Cooky Sipper . " " Everyone in England eats eels , " Christopher Gray said . " Eels eat anything that 's dead . " " You 'll never catch me eating the body of a fellow human , " Langman said . " My conscience would never let me rest . " " You 've already got more on your conscience than any one man should be called on to endure , " Captain Dean said . " Eating a man would be a sin , " Langman protested . " If I agreed to it , I 'd be forever damned . " " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my opinion it 's not as much of a sin as swearing to a lie that robs a man of his good name . You 've lied about the insurancemy brother and I carried on the Nottingham . You lied when you said I purposely ran the Nottingham ashore . I think you 're damned already . " Langman eyed the captain sourly . " Captain , " Christopher Gray said , " Hallion lived with Indians in Nova Scotia , and Hallion said that when one Indian killed another in battle , he ate the dead Indian'sheart . Hallion said Indians thought it gave ' em courage . " " We could use a few Indians ' hearts on Boon Island , " Captain Dean said . " I think all of us could ! We 've lost the only one who did n't need to eat an Indian 's heart . . . Swede Butler . " " Are you accusing us of cowardice ? " Langman asked . " Mr. Langman , " the captain said , " I ordered you and George White to drag Chips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did n't you do it ? "  | " I told Mr. Whitworth , " Langman said . " We 're too weak . " " If you 're too weak to do that , you 're weak from hunger . And if you 're hungry enough , you 'll eat anything . I know . Yesterday I tried , like a dog , to eat my own frozen excrement . I think you did n't move Chips because you secretlywanted to eat him but lacked the courage to say so . " " I 'll never eat a fellow human , " Langman repeated . " We 'll vote , " Captain Dean said . " We 'll vote whether or not we 'll eat this body . Neal , you 're youngest , but you wo n't vote until after all the others . " " I want to vote , " Neal said . " My father would have voted Yes , and that 's how I vote . " " Mr. Langman ? " asked the captain . " Never shall it be  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote No . Christopher Gray ? " " I vote Yes , " Gray said . " Captain , we 're almost dead from lack of meat . " " Henry Dean ? " the captain asked . " Yes , " his brother said . " Charles Graystock ? " the captain asked . " I 'm in no doubt about you or Saver . " " Yes ! " Graystock shouted . " And Saver ? " Saver said Yes in strong , firm tones . Nobody could have guessed , from the quality of their voices , that from the momentwe dropped from the Nottingham 's foremast onto the seaweed of Boon Island , those two had been the malingerers , resented by all , perpetual thorns in the captain 's flesh , refusing to work ; sullen , even , when fed with musselsgathered by others.  | " Now let 's see , " the captain said , " that 's five in favor of eating . That only leaves three to vote  --  Whitworth , George White , Nicholas Mellen . So there 's no need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What about you ? " Langman asked . The captain ignored him , and I knew why . The captain did n't want to vote Yes ; but if he had , Langman , at the first opportunity , would have taken oath that the eating of Chips Bullock had been done at the captain 's suggestion . He might even have implied that the captain killed Chips in order to eat him . That was the sort of person Langman was . Unfortunately there 'll always be Langmans in this world , to set people and nations against each other  --  to condemn the good and extol the bad  --  to spread sly rumors and spit on the truth . There was something horrible about the open excitement of Saver and Graystock when the captain agreed to the eating of Chips , but ironically I was not horrified by the inner relief I felt myself . I was even puzzled by the steadfast refusal , on the part of those who had most feverishly urged the eating , to help carry the body from the tent . When Neal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply aside . He wanted the others , the responsible ones , to do it ; but when he gave the necessary orders , they lay in their places like dogs that , even though whipped , refuse to carry out their masters ' orders . Their eyes rolled up at him , exactly like those of cowering dogs , and it was plain that no orders , no prayers , no punishment , would persuade them to take part in the act they 'd begged the captain to permit . In the end , Neal and I helped him drag out the body.  |p198He  had tried to do it alone , but it was too much for him . Even with our help it was almost too much for all three of us , so that when the body lay on the cold ledge , we were numb mentally and physically , and the captain took us back to the tent , where he lay with eyes closed , until the men again wailingly asked for meat . At half tide he roused himself , and instantly the men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't help . They just would n't help . We had the saw , made so laboriously from the cutlass , and we had our knives . We had nothing else except spun yarn , taken from the tent , and two squares of canvas , cut from the boulder-weighted slack we had left when the tent was built . " First , " the captain said , " I 'll make a bag of the clothes and put ' em in that rock crevice yonder . Then I 'll wrap the head in the clothes , and the feet and the hands and the skin  --  and the other things . And the bones . We 'll have to bone out the meat , so we can wrap it and cut it into equal pieces . We 'll put the clothes in a crevice with boulders piled over it . We 'll make a cross out of two pieces of wood and wedge it in the boulders . " His mention of the cross made us feel better . He hefted the cutlass-saw . " Now , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the north side of the island . See whether anything 's come ashore . Look at the mainland for signs of boats . I 've got things to do , and I 'm reconciled to doing them . To me , this is meat . " He touched Chips 's body with the tip of the saw ; thenp199continued , " Eventually it will be meat to both of you : something over which to say grace . Nothing more . Until then I 'll do what has to be done , but I 'll do it alone . You are n't reconciled yet ; and what I 'm doing , I 'm doing for your fathers ' sake as well as for your own . " When Neal and I hesitated , he impatiently waved us away . " I 'll need help in skinning and boning out , " he said . " When I 'm ready , I 'll wave and you can come back . " The labor of skinning a human body is beyond belief . Perhaps a surgeon would make nothing of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , with our scarred and half-frozen fingers and hands , it was next to impossible . When in exasperation I cursed my helplessness , Captain Dean urged me on . " We ca n't stop , " he said . " If we stop now and wait till tomorrow to finish , it may freeze so solid we ca n't do anything with it . " The skin was n't like a rabbit pelt or a deerskin , that can be raised a little at the neck and then pulled off cleanly from the whole body . This skin had adhesions , so that when it was raised at the neck , it had to be pared away from the flesh beneath by continuous slicing and slashing . Also , unlike an animal 's skin , it was tender in spots , so that it was forever ripping or being pierced by our knives . I thanked God we were no longer hampered by the gulls . If they had been about us , as they had been before Langman killed that progenitor of all gulls , they would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands and soar away , yelling in triumph . The tide was on the make before the meat had beenp200stripped from the leg bones and arm bones , and laid off from the ribs and back . All these were rolled by Neal in tight cylinders and tied with rope yarn . We wedged the bones into the crevice in such a way that no seal or gull could dislodge the boulders above them . Even then we were n't finished , for the rolls , the slabs of meat from belly and buttocks , the liver , the heart and the fat-encased kidneys had to be sunk in an even deeper crevice nearer the tent , covered with three feet of seaweed to guard against freezing , and the seaweed in turn topped by a double layer of boulders . We worked in silence , except when Neal brought the kidneys back to the captain , after washing them in salt water . " Keep those on top of everything , " the captain said . " That fat is just as good as mutton tallow . Maybe we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and depressed to the tent to feed those comrades who had lain there , sunk in helplessnessbecause of some frightened quirk of their disgustingbrains , Langman , White and Mellen , as able-bodied as any of us , refused to eat . " An insult , " Langman mumbled , " to the spirit of a friend . " " Langman , " Captain Dean said , " my duty by you is done . Eat or do n't eat , as you please . But my duty to the rest of us is not done , and if I hear any more talk out of you about this meat being anybody 's spirit , you 'll rue the day ! " " Are you threatening me ? " Langman asked . " Yes , I 'm threatening you , " Captain Dean said . " If you pour out your spleen on these others , I 'll protect them byp201stopping your mouth . This meat I 'm offering is nobody 's spirit . It 's beef . It was animated once by a soul and a spirit , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving only beef behind . " He threw up his hands in disgust at Langman 's mutterings , drew his knife and carefully divided the rolled meat into slices . " Listen carefully , " he said , before he handed out the slices . " We have enough beef for a week , if we 're careful . If Langman , White and Mellen do n't eat , we 'll have enough for a longer time . But this you must do : you must scrape the beef to a pulp , and with each piece of pulp you must chew seaweed . You must n't gulp it down . You must not gulp it down . " He handed around the meat , and the tent was filled with the soft sound of scraping and chewing , audible above the angry roaring of the breakers . I tried to remember what Captain Dean had said about being reconciled . I expected to be revolted by the meat and the seaweed , but I was n't . It was n't offensive . It was n't nauseating . It had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could think of was Langman , meatless , staring out from the darkness with hard and hating eyes , and once I thought I felt Chips Bullock behind me , a little stooped , his head lowered , laughing that silent , belly-shaking laugh of his at Langman , Mellen and White.  |p202Boon  Island taught me the danger of trusting those who at any time have lied about their reasons for doing things . It taught me , too , that no man should ever say , " I 'll never do this , " or " I 'll never do that , " or should ever affirm , " Nothing could persuade me to do this ; nothing could make me do that . " Never , Langman had sworn , would he eat human flesh . It was sinful , it was unlawful , it was repugnant to all the dictates of his conscience . He had implied that the eating of any human flesh was heinous , but that to eat the flesh of a friend was worse : was obscene , infamous , abominable  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specious argument was worthy of consideration . The wind had threatened us by backing up on Thursday . On Friday that threat materialized , Shortly after midnighta mixture of snow and rain from the southwest slatted against the tent ; driblets of water trickled down upon us , first from one spot and then from another . Even before daybreak the men , restless , were demandingmeat , The snow and the rain , they said , might damagep203it , freeze it , ruin it . It should be brought out and distributed . " You 'll get your meat , " Captain Dean assured them , " but I made up my mind to something yesterday , when able-bodied men lay here and would n't lift a hand to do the necessary work to provide the meat because they pretended to be too weak : then ate with the strength of wolves . This is what I decided . If they 've got the strength to eat meat , they had the strength , yesterday , to help me cut it up . They would n't do it ! I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody said anything . " So , " Captain Dean said , " let 's see where we stand . Swede is gone and Harry Hallion with him . Cooky Sipper is gone . Chips Bullock is gone . Mr. Langman 's conscience wo n't let him eat human flesh . Neither will White 's nor Mellen 's . " That leaves seven of us . All seven will draw a reasonableration of meat this morning , but each one of us must do something in return , and that 's pick enough oakum to thatch this tent . " That means Saver and Graystock will pick oakum or get no meat . It means my brother will pick oakum , even though he does have epileptic fits once in a while . It means I 'll pick oakum , Mr. Whitworth will pick oakum . So will Neal Butler and Christopher Gray . Is that understood ? " " Just give us the meat , " Graystock said . " That 's not enough , " Captain Dean said . " I want your promises , made in the hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must swear that if he eats meat , he 'll pick oakum as long as he can move his hands . Saver , do you solemnly swear you 'll pick oakum with the rest of us ? "  |p204Saver  said he did , as did Graystock and the other four of us . " All right , " Captain Dean said . " I expect every one of you to live up to your promises . If you do n't , I 'll take steps . " He went to the tent-flap , hit it with his fist to clear it of snow and ice and peered out into the storm . Langman got to his feet and moved close to the captain . " Captain , " he said , " we 've changed our minds about the beef . " The captain looked at him incredulously . " You mean to say you and White and Mellen changed your minds ? It 's not a sin to eat this beef ? " " No , " Langman said . " It 's not a sin to eat beef . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd made a mistake . " Captain Dean shook his head . " But only last night your consciences were bothering you ! How did you persuade your consciences to accept this as beef ? " " Why , " Langman said , " we just told our consciences it was beef . For a while our consciences would n't listen , but in the end they did . I almost woke you up in the middle of the night to tell you our consciences had stopped bothering us . " Well , I 'm glad to hear it , " Captain Dean said , " but there are two or three other little things that your conscienceswill have to consider before we admit you to our society . In the first place , you have to give us your word that you 'll pick oakum for thatching the tent . " " You have my word , " Langman said . " Now I 'll have to have White 's word , " the captain said , " and Mellen's. "  |p205Both  White and Mellen spoke up quickly . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are two other things , " he said . " One is the matter of Sunday . It 's of small moment to me what day of the week a man worships his God , but if he arbitrarily picks a Sunday that differs from the one we celebrate , he creates unrest , and we have all the unrest we need without creating more . Your Sunday , Langman , is an irritation . If you eat meat with the rest of us in spite of your yesterday 's conscience , you can persuadeyour conscience to accept our Sunday , too . " " All right , " Langman said . " But tomorrow 's Sunday just the same . " " Then you wo n't want any meat , " Captain Dean said . " Just a minute , " Langman said . " I did n't say I would n't worship on the day you do . " " For God 's sake , " Saver said . " Stop talking . Give us our meat ! " The captain looked as genial as a dirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how we felt , Saver , " he said , " when you and Graystock just lay there and let the rest of us do your work for you . " He turned back to Langman . " You had your chance yesterday . You were offered a fair share of all we had , and with no strings attached . But you made a show of yourself by refusing to take what we offered . You were n't honest about it . So if we give you meat now , you 'll have to pay a penalty for past dishonesty : you 'll have to be honest with us  --  if you can regard that as a penalty , which I do n't . " Langman was indignant . " I 've always been honest ! Did n't I divide that seagull with you ? "  | " That 's physical honesty , " Captain Dean said . " Almost everyone is physically honest . I 'm talking about mental honesty . Most of the men in this tent are both physically and mentally honest . I think even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indebted to you , and so they accept the things you tell ' em as being true , which they are n't . " " I do n't know what you 're talking about , " Langman said . " If you do n't , you 're weak-minded , " Captain Dean said , " and that 's the last thing I 'd accuse you of . You said repeatedly I ran the ship ashore purposely , and that 's the stupidest , silliest piece of mental dishonesty I ever heard . " Langman widened his eyes at the captain . " If that 's all that 's bothering you , " he said , " I 'll trade my opinion for the same amount of meat that everyone else gets . " " That is to say , " Captain Dean said , " you give me your word you wo n't repeat that outrageous lie , ever again . " " Why , of course , " Langman said , all mealy-mouthed . The captain pulled aside the tent-flap and went out into the snow . Langman looked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sardonic smile of his . I thought I knew the meaning of that offensive smile . Unless I misjudged Langman , no promise of his was worth anything at all . No matter what he promised , he 'd make a mental reservation that would free his twisted mind of the need to carry out his promise . Even if he were somehow prevented from making a mental reservation , that devious brain would invent a loopholethat would release him from his obligation . Statesmen , often , are like that , and so are men of busi/ness  --  which may explain why the English guard themselves so carefully against men of business as well as against some statesmen  --  usually the wrong ones . I think the captain , having brought Langman around to his way of thinking by a sort of justified blackmail , tried to make sure of his conquest by being kinder to him and Mellen and White than to the rest of us . He gave them slivers of liver , whereas the rest of us got along with slices of muscle , full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could say for it was that it was better than the rawhide we had chopped and swallowed so avidly . Tough as the meat was , there was n't one of us who could n't have eaten three times our allotment , and Langmaneven demanded more as a reward for picking oakum all day . " Look here , Langman , " Captain Dean said . " You undertook to pick oakum for the same amount of meat that the rest of us have . If I give you more , I 'll have to give more to everyone else . Then , before we know it , there wo n't be any for anyone . " Langman argued senselessly that he and Mellen and White were entitled to more because they had refused to eat the day before , when all the rest of us had eaten . " Whose fault was that ? " Captain Dean asked . " It was yours , " Langman said , " because you did n't tell us the meat was beef until we 'd made up our minds it was something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , " he said , " but you 're asking for too much , and it 's bad for you to eat too much . Not wicked : not sinful . No more sinfulp208than eating seaweed . But you refused your ration yesterdayand you 've had your ration for today . Now you can keep right on working . " He only left the tent to drag in more cordage for us to pick apart and make into oakum ; and while we made it , he wove it . By dark that Friday he had woven a thatch of oakum that covered the top of the tent and extended two-thirds down the southeastern side . So thanks to Chips Bullock and to Langman 's slippery conscience , we were not only fed , but were free , all night long , of the rivulets of icy water that had trickled down upon us all through that snowy , rainy day.  | " Have somebody light a fire  --  two fires  --  on the beach , " Captain Dean had told Swede before he set off on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could indeed have been called minds , were centered on hunting for smoke on the mainland . Because of Friday 's rain and snow , we could n't see Cape Neddick or the beaches ; but on Saturday the snow and rain stopped , and land was once more visible  --  a land of dark pines , long sands , forbidding cliffs , with no trace of smoke discernible anywhere . Neal was out of the tent at dawn , studying that shore line . We did what we could to buoy up his hopes  --  and ours , too . " Yesterday was so rainy , " Captain Dean said , " that there would n't have been dry wood on the beach . " Neal glanced at him , and the captain looked away . " They might have had to go far before they found a house , " I said . " Two or three days might pass before fires could be lit. "  |p210Neal  did n't reply . He just crept back into the tent and went to picking oakum . I do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances such as ours ; but I suspect they move more slowly , always  --  more and more slowly , until they scarcely move at all . If that were n't so  --  if their minds worked actively on their situations , their lives would be unendurable and they 'd die . While there was a possibility of seeing smoke , we seemed content to sit and pick oakum : to wait until the captain had finished carving more beef for us : to wait until the next time someone went to the tent-flap to scan the land for a wisp of smoke . We were like sleepers half awake , who mutter disjointed sentences , utter words that seem to a dreamer to be intelligible . Like those aroused from dreams , we resented attempts to make sense from our mumblings . Altercations broke out unexpectedly . When Langman gabbled something about " This day our daily bread , " Christopher Gray , the gunner , flew at him . " What you want to talk that way for ? " Gray demanded . " What way ? " Langman asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " That means that this day 's Sunday , but you know it ai n't . It 's Saturday . You promised the captain you 'd have the same Sunday as us . " " I never said today was Sunday , " Langman said . " You said , This day , ' " Gray repeated , " and This day ' means Sunday . " " I never did , " Langman said , " and if I did , This day ' does n't mean anything except this day . This day can be  |p211Gray  , enraged , lunged at him , and they thrashed ineffectuallyaround our odoriferous oakum floor . We caught Gray and set him upright . Forgetting Langman , he picked numbly at the hemp before him . The captain came in among us and gave us our slices of beef . " Any smoke ? " Henry Dean asked . " None that I could see , " the captain said . He looked apologetically at Neal . Langman sneered . " You would n't have seen it , even if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would know they never got ashore . " " Keep your mouth shut , " Captain Dean said . " That 's not part of our bargain , " Langman said . " First thing I know , you 'll tell me I ca n't have meat unless I stop hearing and seeing and smelling . " The captain groaned in disgust and collapsed heavily beside his coil of cordage , only to rise again when Mellen and White , without warning , belabored each other . The captain pulled them apart and sat between them . " What 's all this ? " he said . " Why waste your strength on each other ? " " Nobody can call me a liar , " Mellen said , " just because I recall one or two things that happened when I was with Woodes Rogers . " " I was there , " White protested . " He talked about how a beautiful woman cooked for him when we stopped in Brazil to give the ship a pair of boot tops . " " Well , she was ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fairy queen hell , " White said . " I saw ' em . They looked like cows and smelled like pigs , all of ' em ! "  |p212White  and Mellen cursed each other . The thought came to me that their dispositions had changed , and their voices , too . Their voices were breathless , squealing , like pigs struggling at a trough . I wondered whether the meat had done it , or the salty ice we chewed to quench our thirst , or the unending cold , or our inner fears of the eternity that had drawn so close . I pulled at Neal 's sleeve , and we went out on the rock . We looked all along the coast for smoke . Like the captain , we saw nothing . " Neal , " I said , " it might help these men if you recited parts of plays to them . " Neal shook his head . " Why not ? " I said . " It might keep them quiet . " " No , it would n't , " Neal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd laugh at any part of any play , because plays are n't worth believing . Nothing 's true except this . " He swept his arm from the tent toward the ocean and the mainland . There was n't much I could say . " Anyway , " Neal said , " I 've forgotten everything . I do n't want to remember , and I never will . I 'll only remember that my father hated the stage and wanted to keep me from it . I want to forget my name , even . I want it to be what it should be  --  Moses . That 's what my father and my mother named me . " If I 'd never gone near the theatre  --  if I had n't done what my father did n't want me to do  --  the Nottingham would n't have sailed when she did . She would n't have gone to Killybegs to take on butter and cheese . She 'd never have struck this island . It 's all my fault . " " Look , Neal , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can trace every bad thing in the world back to some little incident that nobody was to blame for . Instead of blaming yourself , blame the circumstances that brought that nasty little fop to Greenwich . Blame the thing that made him a fop in the first place . " Neal 's eyes had a hunted look . I think if there 'd been a hole on that barren rock into which he could have crawled , he 'd have crept there to get away from me , from Captain Dean , from his memories , from the eternal thundering of the breakers all around us . " I know how you feel , " I said , " and I 'm glad you do . My father was right , too , and I wish I could tell him so . I can hear him now  --  ' pint-sized clowns in tatters and tarnishedgold lace , making faces and laughing like hyenas at their damned dull witlessness . ' " Singularly , I thought of Sir Isaac Newton and his discovery of the reflecting telescope : of Langman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed at the truth . And ironically it came to me that there would be people like Langman who would say that there was no truth to this island or to the tribulations we 'd endured upon it : that our labors were nonsense . It came to me suddenly that when I left this island , if I ever did leave it , I wanted nothing to do with the Langmans of this world  --  nothing to do with those who derided the truth , and defiled it . We went back to the tent . The captain , carving pieces of fat from Chips Bullock 's kidneys , looked up at us sharply . " Any smoke ? " When we shook our heads , he sliced off a piece of the fat , laid it on a board and pounded it with the handle of his knife , spreading it into a thin sheet.  | " There , " he said . " That 's pretty near the same as the mutton tallow my grandmother used to make . Each one of you can have an equal amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as possible . " We 'll flatten it out , flatten it out , and when it 's as thin as we can make it , we 'll take off these oakum bindings and wash our feet and legs again , same as we did before . The fat ought to be good for deep sores . It 's bound to help those who 've lost toes . "  |p215If  a man , on the last day of any year , chooses honestly to consider his shortcomings , he must always be depressed ; and if any people anywhere ever had occasion to be downcaston the last day of that year , it was we on Boon Island . The sight of our legs and feet on the day before , when we applied the poultices of kidney fat to them , had frightenedus . They were worse  --  much worse  --  than they had been in the dim and dreadful past , when we cut off our boots and first swathed ourselves in oakum . The sores were deeper : the toes broke off more easily , though without pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his in the deep dark , and flung himself around the tent as though he had eight legs and eight arms , all made of steel . When we finally pinned him down , he twisted and turned in our hands with almost unbelievableviolence , and on top of that he groaned horribly , and there 's something catching  --  something poisonous  --  about groans . The whole night was a bad one and after Henry Deanp216had stopped thrashing and writhing , and had fallen into an epileptic 's heavy sleep , I lay staring upward , afraid of the dark , afraid of what must happen to my feet and legs if this cold continued  --  if we went on and on , being drenched daily by the salty spit from the breakers  --  if I lost the use of my hands and could no longer occupy myself in the brain-deadening task of picking oakum . In my thinking I groaned , realized too late what 1 was doing , tried to turn it into a cough , and produced a sort of squawk , like a crow with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my shoulder and heard Neal say , " Are you all right , Miles ? " " Of course , " I said . " Of course I 'm all right . Are you all right ? " " We 're all all right , " Captain Dean said . " Even my brother 's all right  --  or will be when he wakes . All of you felt how much strength he has . Just remember you 're all as strong as Henry if only you make up your minds to be . " He hesitated : then added , " I 've been thinking . I do n't believe we 've been praying right . We 've been praying as if we did n't know God at all  --  as if he was some sort of distant image , away up above the stars somewhere  --  an image with whiskers , like ours . " Well , he is n't an image . He 's real . And since we expect him to answer our prayers , he ca n't be far away . We believe he 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do n't ask him for that help in the same way we 'd ask our own fathers for help . " He hesitated again . " Would anyone like to speak to God ? If you ca n't find the words , I 'll speak for you , but I think you might feel better if you did your own speak-ing. "  | " I 'd like to speak to God , " Neal said . " I 'd like to speak about my father . God , I 'd like to have my father told that I know what he did for us . You must know what he did , God , and I hope you wo n't let it be wasted . " " What do you mean by that , Neal ? " the captain asked . " God knows , " Neal said . After a time the captain spoke again , conversationally , as if God were in the tent with us . " God , " he said , " you 've been kind to us , though some might think you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've saved us from the most horrible of all deaths : you 've given us work to do , so that we 've preserved our sanity : you saved us from disasterwhen you overturned the boat : you let the sea wash up the cordage from which we made clothing and shelter : you gave us seaweed to eat : you gave us Swede Butler to strengthen our courage . . . " Langman spoke up . " Do n't forget the seagull . " " Yes , God ; the seagull , " Captain Dean said . " The seagull helped us . All things considered , God , we 've done as well with these blessings as any equal number of men could be expected to do , and all we ask , God , is that you do n't withdraw your favor from us . " " Are n't you going to ask for a ship to take us off ? " Langman demanded . " Why do n't you ask him to send the seagulls back ? There has n't been one sighted since I killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded . The captain shook his head . " Ask for them yourselves if you think it 'll do any good , " he said . " If God feels we should be helped , I think he ought to be allowed to work it out in his own way . I do n't feel qualified to tell God what to do or how to do it . I would n't feel justified inp218asking him for more seagulls . He probably had a good reason for sending ' ern away from the island . " I could n't improve on what the captain had said , and the others were silent as well ; but I think we all felt better because of Neal 's and the captain 's talks with God . For the first time I felt about God as I 'd so often felt about my father : felt that he 'd do anything reasonable I asked him to do , and that if he should refuse , he 'd only do so for my own good . There were lines of light showing around the edges of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help him with the meat . Neal followed me . He did n't even look toward Cape Neddick or York . " Neal , " the captain said , " I want you to find another hole in the rock where we can store part of this meat . I want you to attend to moving half of it , and I do n't want to know where you put it . I do n't want anyone to know : not even Miles . " Neal nodded and moved away . Captain Dean watched him go , then turned to me . " Was it three days ago , Miles , " he asked , " or four days ago that Swede and Hallion put off ? I forget . Every day seems a year long . " " It was Wednesday , " I said . " Miles , " he said slowly , " I think Neal knows his father 's gone . " " I know he does , " I said . " I know it , too , and so do you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows more than we do . "  | " Yes , " I said , " I know that he thinks he knows , but that does n't necessarily mean he 's right . I hope he is n't . " When the captain did n't answer , I asked him what he meant by asking Neal to find another hole in the rock . " I do n't quite know , " the captain said . " I think this meat has made some of the men a little crazy . Have you noticed Saver 's and Graystock 's eyes when I pass around the meat ? " I said I had n't . " Well , " Captain Dean said , " I had a ferret when I was a boy . I 'd turn him loose in the stables , and he 'd kill rats . When he jumped on a rat , his eyes looked red . I do n't think they were red , but that 's how they looked . That 's how Saver 's and Graystock 's eyes look when they get their meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might crawl out of the tent any night . Being the sort of people they are , they would n't hesitate to steal what rightly belongs to all the rest of us , and they have n't enough brains between them to exercise restraint or common sense in their eating . They 'd eat until they dropped dead . " He watched Neal coming slowly back to us , picking his way over the icy ledges . The captain drew four large bundles of meat from beneath the seaweed and piled them in Neal 's arms . " Be sure they 're covered with three feet of seaweed , " he told Neal . When Neal was out of hearing , the captain asked , with seeming carelessness , " What is it Neal thinks happened to his father ? " " Well , " I said , " you know how I feel about Neal . From the moment I saw him , I 've thought of him as a brother  --  a younger brother . I would n't want you to think thatp220there 's anything odd about him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The captain sniffed . " I know hallucinations when I see ' em , Miles . The night the Nottingham was wrecked , I was sure none of us would last until morning . Then when morning came , I had a feeling . Not an hallucination . I do n't know how you get feelings , or where they come from ; but I had the feeling we were going to come safely out of this . I still have it , and I still think I 'm right . That 's no hallucination . Now what is it that Neal feels about his father ? " " Well , " I said , " he thinks he saw his father in a dream , or something like that . His father told him the raft had n't a chance of getting to shore with two men on it . He told Neal that since he was a good swimmer , he was going to get into the water and swim and push . He thought that if he did that , the raft might get to shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The captain nodded . " I see . " " Well , that 's what Neal thinks , Captain . He thinks his father swam as long as he could , and then just slipped off . " " I can think of worse ways to go , " the captain said.  |p221This  was the day we saw the smoke . Neal saw it first and was less affected by it than the rest of us . He left the tent early , no doubt to make sure that nothing or nobody had disturbed the place where he 'd hidden the beef . When he came back he said , almost idly , " There 's smoke on the mainland . It 's blowing to the eastward . " We jostled each other to crawl from the tent to see this sign  --  the first hopeful one we 'd seen in three long weeks . There it was  --  a plume of smoke from a fire that must have been newly kindled , for the plume , a mere smudge to begin with , grew constantly longer and longer , drifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it meant , we could n't know , but Captain Dean insisted that it must be a signal  --  a signal to let us know our plight had been discovered . As near as we could tell , the smoke was rising to the south of west , probably , the captain thought , from somewherebetween York and Portsmouth . Langman insisted it could n't be a signal , because thep222fire was so far south of the direction in which the raft had been heading when it put out from Boon Island ; but the captain said this did n't necessarily follow . " Why would anyone bother with a signal ? " Langman asked . " There 's an offshore breeze , and only six or eight miles to go . Any sloop or schooner could sail that distance in less time than it took somebody to start that fire . " " I do n't know , " Captain Dean admitted , " but I know that raft got ashore . If it got ashore , somebody saw it . Anybody who saw it would recognize it as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . That raft was laced and knotted with everything from bos'n 's knots to granny knots . Where else but on Boon Island would a lot of wrecked seamen have nothing to work with ? " All day long we argued the matter . Only Neal refused to discuss it ; but the arguments of the rest of us rose and fell like waves . At one moment we were elated in a firm belief that the smoke was a signal : in the next moment we decided it could n't be a signal : that it must be an accident ; a hay barn afire ; a farmer clearing land . One thing was apparent . Before we saw the smoke , my companions were images of Death itself : horrible , haggard , slow-moving creatures , tangled of hair and beard , stooped with hunger , swathed about the head and hands and legs with clumsy bands of oakum . After they 'd seen the smoke , they stood straighter : their voices were stronger : their eyes less wild and staring . What was worse , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat from the captain . " If you 're so sure that smoke 's a signal , " Langman said , " you must be equally sure that they 'll send a ship for us . Why should n't we divide half of the meat that 's left ? "  |p223The  captain shook his head . " When they say they want more , " he said , " they want three times what they 've been getting . That 's too much for half-starved men to have . " There 's another thing : we 've none of us ever had meat like this . There 's no telling what it may do to us . You must know what happens to half-starved men when they eat too much . They get sick . Sometimes they die . " He lifted the seaweed covering from the store of meat , drew out a generous chunk and sliced it quickly into ten parts , each part almost twice the size of those we 'd hitherto received . With each slice went a handful of seaweed from the pile that had covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Langman , Mellen and White in one group : Graystock , Saver and Gray in another . All of them scraped diligently at their meat , and chewed at their seaweed ; and from time to time they turned their heads to gaze covertly at the captain , Neal , Henry Dean and me . There was no doubt about it : each group was plotting something . Captain Dean shuffled his feet on the icy rock . " I do n't like it , " he said . " We 'll have to put a guard over this meat . I said I was sure the smoke was a signal , but I 'm not sure at all . I 'm not sure of anything but this : if they steal this meat and eat it all , they wo n't hesitate to kill someone in order to have more . " The rest of that day was a nightmare . The wind cut cruelly , but all day long we were in and out of the tent , not only to scan the far-off coast line in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep watch on the spot where our beef was stored . By midafternoon , while the smoke continued to driftp224from west to east , the tide was half out and it was apparent to all of us that no vessel would venture out in the short time remaining . That night the captain lay across the tent-flap . Neal lay between the two of us , and in the early dark I could feel Neal shaking , feel him swallow , as people do when their minds are not at rest . His shaking may have come from the cold , but I somehow knew he was thinking about his father . Remembering how Neal had shrunk from me when , on that long-gone summer day in Greenwich , I had inadvertentlytouched him , I did nothing ; but the captain said , " Neal , roll over on top of me and keep me warm . And Miles : come closer , Miles . " We huddled together . I could feel rather than hear the soft patting of the captain'shand against Neal 's shoulder . Neal 's shudderings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of bad weather , there was little or nothing to do on Boon Island except pick at that loathsome oakum , or stumble around the island on our eternal patrols , the days sometimes seemed endless because of their monotony and the biting cold . Probably the very monotony was so deadening that the time passed more rapidly than we thought . There was no monotony , God knows , to that second day of January ; and the endlessness of that one day , by comparison with other memorable days of my life , went on and on until , at nightfall , I felt as though I had lived years . The captain , as usual , was first out of the tent , and the tent-flap had no sooner fallen behind him than sounds came from him , a sort of hiccuping and gasping , broken by quavering hootings , such as come from a loon . Thinking he might have caught epilepsy from his brother , I crawled out to help him . He was on all fours , pawing feebly at the rocks , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken bones : of a captain made helpless at the hour of our greatest need , and my heart sank . " What 's the matter ? " I asked , frightened sick by his apparent weakness . I got him by the arm and tried to help him up . He caught me by the shoulders and leaned against me . I could n't tell whether in falling he had knocked the breath from himself , or was in such excruciating agony that his face was contorted by it into a twisted travesty of a grin . " Sail , " he gasped . " Boat ! " Tears ran down his cheeks : snuffling like a child , he swung an arm to the westward , turning me in that direction . There , halfway between us and the shore , a scant three miles away , was a little sloop , bobbing and bowing , curtsyingand rocking over the heavy lead-colored swells , heading straight for the center of the island 's western shore on a cold and sharp northwest wind . I could n't believe my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : then looked back at the sloop . I was n't dreaming ! I was n't imagining things ! She yawed a little as she slipped down the face of a following sea . A man holding to her mast flapped an arm at his helmsman . She was a real vessel with a patch at the foot of her jib . She had people aboard  --  living human beings . My throat constricted : my breath caught convulsively at my chest . I could n't speak : I could n't draw air into my lungs . I pulled at the tent-flap and croaked , " Neal ! " He crawled out , white-faced , saw the sloop and made a whimpering sound . The others came out , too . They just stood there , staring at the beautiful little vessel , while tears of which they were unconscious trickled from their eyes and clung in silvery drops to their matted beards.  |p227We  spread out along the western side of the island , trying to convey by gestures , to that man who stood before the sloop 's mast , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dean waved and waved , pointing to the southeast , where the sloop could run close to the island  --  close enough down-wind to hear our voices ; but the sloop brought to at the north end of the island , came into the wind , and dropped her anchor and jib . She was as far offshore as the island was long . " Wave her off , " Captain Dean told us . " She 'll drag her anchor  --  pile up on a ledge ! " There were three men aboard her  --  smoothly shaved men with rosy faces , warm clothes , fur hats . Well-fed men , quick-moving , firm on their feet , unlike us : strong men , pillars of strength : symbols of life and salvation . Captain Dean pointed out to sea , flapped his hands to warn them off . With his arms he made slow circles . To us his meaning was apparent . He wanted them to pull off shore : to sail in circles until high tide . He pointed again and again to the southeast , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Certainly their anchor was dragging , or their roding too short , for she was constantly drawing nearer , pushed by those damnable swells out of the north . We groaned with relief when she hoisted her jib and fell off a mile to the eastward , headed north , tacked into the west , and then stood off and on , lively as a duck , waiting for flood tide . Under the best of circumstances , waiting can be one of the worst curses that man is called upon to endure  --  waiting for a loved one , while the mind conjures up visions ofp228injury , disaster , death : waiting tensely , despairingly , for a reply to a letter : waiting fearfully for a battle to begin : waiting for a ship to sail : waiting for a guest to arrive or to go : waiting sleeplessly through the watches of the night for the day that seems determined not to come : waiting , all a-sweat , for the cessation of pain , or for the doctor who may relieve it : waiting apprehensively for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abate . Never , I thought , as I waited for that sloop to return  --  as all of us waited , torn by our fears , our nerves a-jangle  --  would I wittingly add to man 's burdens by keeping anyone waiting . With that sloop in the offing , waiting became a poison , so that voices all around us broke , arms and legs jerked uncontrollably , minds and thinking were disarranged . Some laughed like women : fell into black depressions , trembled , cursed , groaned , stammered , yawned cavernously . Captain Dean , once more calm and composed , carved our meat and passed around the seaweed  --  and after an eternity the little sloop slipped in to coast back and forth across the southern tip of the island . With each pass she drew closer . We could see she carried no boat ; only a bark canoe lashed alongside her cabin . The behavior of the three men who sailed her filled me with anxiety . They eyed us warily : glanced at each other , as if in doubt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't blame them . " You 've got six feet at flood tide , " Captain Dean shouted . " Fifteen feet offshore you 've got six feet . " The sloop 's master waved his hand , brought the sloop into the wind , dropped his jib and spilled the anchor over  |p229the  bow . The three men ducked under the sloop 's boom and studied us again . They looked worried . " Ship Nottingham , " the captain shouted . A wave curled over and fell noisily . He waited for the roaring to subside : then tried again . " Ship Nottingham . London to Ports-mouth . " We could n't tell whether or not the three men could hear . Captain Dean turned to the rest of us and spoke sharply . " I do n't dare tell ' em how much we need food . They might not come ashore . " To the sloop he shouted again , " Fire ! We need fire ! Cold ! Frozen ! " He held his ears : bent over , he hugged himself . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motions of using a tinderbox . He pretended to blow on a fire and then to warm his hands before it . Two of the men unlashed the canoe , lowered it over the side and held it while the third man stepped down into it , knelt in the middle , and took two paddles that were handed to him . One he stowed beneath the thwarts . With the other he pushed off from the sloop and , still kneeling , headed for the cleft in the rock where we were gathered . " Remember , " Captain Dean warned us , " do n't say a word about our meat . " The man in the canoe held his paddle steady , looked behind him , waited for a swell to come near his stern : then dug in his paddle and came rushing toward us on the slope of a roller . Captain Dean and George White braced themselvesat the head of the cleft , caught the canoe by thep230bow and held it where it was while the wave slipped back . The canoeman , still clutching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White and Captain Dean carry the canoe up higher , out of harm 's way . " We knew somebody had been cast away , and probably here , " he said . He spoke slowly , and with assurance , a little like those who came up to Oxford from Warwick or Hereford  --  from places like Stratford-on-Avon or Broadway , where people have had the benefit of schooling . " I 'm John Dean , " the captain said , " master of the NottinghamGalley . We went ashore --  " He broke off , looked from the canoeman to Langman and back again : then asked , " What day is this  --  sir ? " " This is January znd , a Tuesday , " the man said . " I 'm Nason . Richard Nason . Kittery . Part owner of the sloop Head of Tide . " " It ca n't be Tuesday , " Langman said . " It must be Wed-nesday . " Nason looked at him oddly . " Why must it ? " " Because I kept count , " Langman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Monday  --  New Year 's Day . " Captain Dean nodded . " We went ashore Monday , Decemberi ith . There was a northeaster blowing . " " You 've been on this pile of rocks since the eleventh of December ? " Nason asked incredulously . His eyes swept over us , examining us from head to foot  --  from our oakum hats , with bits of seagull feathers and seagull skin woven into them , the oakum mittens on our hands , the oakum wrappings fastened to our shoulders , chests and legs , the clumsy oakum sheathings of our feet . He shook his head as if he found us incredible.  | " Kittery ? " Captain Dean asked . " Is n't that across the river from Portsmouth ? " " Yes , " Nason said , " and I better not waste time . We 'll have to take word to Portsmouth about you . You need help as much as anyone I ever saw ! " " Yes , " Captain Dean said . " We need help . When you send word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told . They 're old friends . You tell ' ern I 'm John Dean of Twickenham , Jasper Dean 's brother . " " Wait a minute , " Nason said . " I 'll write it down . " He fished in his clothes and produced a small account book : then stared at Captain Dean again : at me : at Neal Butler . " No fire all that time ? " he asked . " How could you live ! " Christopher Gray broke into a sort of snuffling , such as a dog makes when he whuffles for the scent of an animal behind the wainscoting . " It seemed like a long time , " Captain Dean said apologetically . " We built a boat and lost it . Then we built a raft . This boy 's father built it . " He put his hand on Nears shoulder . Nason cleared his throat . " Oh , yes , " he said . " The raft ! We figured there 'd been two men on it . We figured a lot of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We found it at high-water mark . Under a tree beyond highwatermark there was a man . One man . With a piece of wood tied to his wrist . He 'd used it for a paddle . His hands were all raw , with the bones showing . He got as far as the tree and then I guess he lay down and froze to death . " He shook his head , put his account book back in his pocket , and became suddenly busy . " I 'll start a fire for you . Got any wood ? "  | " One or two pieces , " Captain Dean said . " You 've probably got knives , " Nason said . " Slice up wood slivers for kindling . " He moved toward the tent . " What color was the man 's hair  --  the one under the tree ? " Captain Dean asked . " Black , " Nason said , " with white streaks . " He looked at Neal . " Was this boy 's father  --  the one who built the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " Captain Dean said , " but he had yellow hair . " " That 's too bad , " Nason said . " That 's a shame . " He took a tinderbox from his shirt  --  a tin one , with a candle ring on the top  --  then went into the tent ahead of the rest of us , being more active and quicker on his feet ; but he came out more quickly than he went in . His cheeks had lost their rosy , clean-shaven look , and were gray and mottled . He held to the canvas of the tent . " The men are pretty- weak , " Captain Dean explained . " When it snows or the wind 's bad , they do n't make the effort to go outside . I 've stopped trying to make ' em . You get used to it . " Nason swallowed . " You go in and make a fire hole , " he said . " Clear away the oakum in the center . Lay up a circle of rocks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then I 'll light the tinder and a candle . I 'll leave the tinderbox with you . " When Neal and I came past him with rocks to make the circle , Nason put out his hand and took Neal 's rock from him . " I 'm sorry about your father , " he said . Neal just nodded , his shoulders back and held high  --  a fine-looking boy , in spite of his oakum helmet and his outlandish swathings.  | " That was quite a thing , " Nason said . " Paddling a raft ashore in the dead of winter . " " He wanted to do it , " Neal said . Nason examined him attentively . " We hunted everywhere , " he said , " up and down the beaches . " " I saw him in a dream , " Neal said . " He got off the raft so it would be sure to get to shore . " Nason turned to look at the sloop : then at the sky in the southeast . Some of the color came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said slowly . " That would explain it . " " Could I find the place where the raft came ashore ? " Neal asked . " I 've got to go there . " " I 'll take you there myself , " Nason said heartily . " You can stay with us . I 've got five brothers and four sisters . There 's so many Nasons in Kittery that we 've worn grooves in the river , sailing up and down it . You come and stay with us : you 'll fit right in between Benjamin and William . " Neal looked at him , then at me . For the first time since I had known him , he was on the verge of tears . Nason seemed embarrassed . He gave the rock back to Neal , took a deep breath and entered the tent again . The circle of rocks was almost finished . The slivers of wood were stacked in the center . Nason fell to his knees , pried the cover from his tinderbox , took out the flint and steel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He struck the flint with thesteel rod ; the spark ignited the linen ; but when he gentlyheld the point of a sliver to the flame , it wavered and died . " Here , " he said to the silent , kneeling figures aroundhim , " slice the ends of those slivers so they 're shredded . " He pulled a sheath knife from his belt and feathered thep234end of one of the slivers . Captain Dean , Langman , George White , Neal and I did the same . " Now I 'll do what I should have done first , " Nason said . " The sight of you people started me off on the wrong foot . I 'll try to light the candle . " He stood the stub of a candle in the candle ring on the top of the tinderbox , rested a piece of tinder against the wick , and again struck sparks from the flint . The tinder ignited : flickered ; went out . " Damn it , " Nason said , suddenly exasperated , " do n't crowd up so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stop breathing ! How can I start a fire with you blowing your breaths all over me ! " He looked at Neal and was suddenly contrite . " Hear me talk , " he said disgustedly , " and you without fire for more than three weeks ! " He produced another piece of tinder , placed it on the candle wick , struck the flint with the steel  --  and the tinder caught : the wick smoked  --  and a yellow flame stood up from it ! Nason turned his head away and whooshed with relief . He stacked up the feathered bits of wood like a little tent , lit one of them from the candle . The flame spread from one stick to another . Captain Dean leaned down and caught one of Nason 's hands in his . The odor of smoke must have affected my eyes , because I could n't see for the wetness in them . Fire ! Warmth ! Cooked food ! Who knows what it 's like to be without them ? Only animals ! I had the thought that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nason took out his little account book and a stub of a pencil , and in the book he wrote down j the facts that Captain Dean had given him . " I 'll go to Portsmouth tonight if I can , " he said . " If I ca n't , I 'll go first thing in the morning . I 'll see Governor Wentworth . I know Captain Furber and Captain Long . They 'll send proper-sized vessels for you , and proper boats to take you off  --  and food . " He looked at the emaciated , bearded faces , accentuated by the flickering light of the fire . " What have you lived on ? - What have you had to eat ? " " We saved some things from the ship , " Captain Dean said . " Some cheese and meat . Then we had mussels and a seagull and seaweed . " " My God ! " Nason said . " Seaweed ! " He made another note in his account book , thrust it in his pocket and scrambledfrom the tent . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I do n't like it . " The tide was half out , and the breakers were pounding on the uncovered ledges . " I ca n't run the risk of launching that canoe where I ran in , " Nason said . Captain Dean agreed . " I think the safest place is around to the northwest . There 's a deep cove we can show you . " Nason studied that rim of surf . It was pounding the island from every side , but certainly the waves were less frequent , the sudsy area larger to the north , showing that the drift was toward the mainland . Everywhere else the drift was onshore . " All right , " Nason said , " I 'll send the sloop around top236the north . " He looked at us uncertainly . " Can any of you people help me get my canoe across the island ? " " We 'll all help you , " Captain Dean said . " Four men 'll have to stay here and tend that fire . Miles , you stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Watch that fire ! Whatever you do , do n't choke it ! Nurse it ! And put the tinderbox and candle out of harm 's way . " He went into the tent and looked at the brisk little fire while Nason set off in the direction of the sloop , gesticulating to his shipmates  --  sweeping his arm around to the north : pointing insistently to the northwest . The others followed along behind him , the captain and Neal , Christopher Gray , George White and Charles Mellen  --  all but Henry Dean , who lay near the fire , twitchingdangerously . If Henry should have an attack of epilepsynow , there was no telling what might happen to the fire . The sloop 's jib rose : her anchor came up and was catted , and she went dipping off to the north , over the long surges ; then bore around to the westward , so that we knew Nason had been understood . The little fire burned brightly , and we stood damp pieces of wood around the circle of rocks , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we cut more shavings , Graystock and Saver pleaded for meat  --  for just one slice of meat . " We 're wasting this fire , " Saver said . " We could be roasting meat over it . " " Keep on cutting shavings , " I told them . " Under the circumstances , I think the captain 'll let us have more tonight , when there 's no danger of losing the fire . " To watch the progress of that bark canoe across the island was harrowing . Nason and the captain carried thep237front end : White and Mellen the stern , while Neal stumbledalongside Nason showing him where to put his feet , and Christopher Gray did the same for Captain Dean . They had overturned it on the two paddles , using the paddles as carrying poles , and because the four men slipped constantly , the canoe 's progress was erratic and fumbling , like that of a beetle on a rough field . The little cove for which they were headed was one we all knew well , because into it , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the junk from which we 'd built the boat and raft . It had a smooth gravelly bottom ; and when the four men righted the canoe and lowered it at the head of that little cove , I drew a deep breath of relief . That , I thought , was all there was to it : news of our whereabouts , of our hunger and our miserablecondition , was already as good as in Portsmouth . Langman , evidently angry because Nason had disagreed with him as to the day of the week , watched the proceedingswith a jaundiced eye . " What 's going on down there ? " he suddenly demanded . " By God , that fool Nason is going to run the captain out to that sloop ! He ca n't do that ! He ca n't let the captain get to Portsmouth ahead of the rest of us ! " He shouted , " Here ! Here ! No ! No ! " and ran from the tent . Nason slid the canoe into the water . Captain Dean , holding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , Nason stepped into the stern , and pushed hard with his paddle . Both men took a few quick strokes . The canoe veered sideways , as if twisted by a current . Her starboard side dipped sharply . When Captain Dean abruptly leaned to larboard to pre/serve her balance , she dipped even more sharply beneath him . A cataract of green water poured over her gunnel , the canoe slid out from under them , and both Nason and the captain went overboard in a surge of foam . Everybody , it seemed to me , was shouting , running and falling down . Nason came up gasping , caught the canoe and pushed it ashore . The captain staggered to a seaweed-covered ledge , looking half drowned . Hands grasped the canoe , emptied water from it , and swung it gently to the water again to let Nason hoist himself aboard . This time Nason , kneeling alone in the middle , stroked his little craft out of the cove , surmounted the green surges , and went safely aboard the sloop . The western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weewawing toward that grayness , was too small and fragile for my peace of mind . " I thought I was gone , " the captain told us when he dragged himself to the tent . " I must have swallowed a tubful . The sloop looked so close to shore , I thought maybe we could all get away this afternoon , but the currentssuck around that north side like a millrace ! There 's something dirty blowing up from the southeast . " He stopped outside the tent to hang over a boulder and rid himself of the salt water he had swallowed . I went on in to see Langman draw from beneath the edges of the tent an armful of tarry rope-ends , hidden away for just this purpose . " Now that we 've got the fire to cook it , " Langman said , " there 'll be an extra meat ration tonight . " He ignited the end of one of those pieces of tarred rope ,  |p239laid  it carefully on the flickering shavings : then crisscrosseda dozen other rope-ends above it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from it came a cloud of yellowish-green smoke that on the instant thickened the air within the tent to a sort of dry , stranglingsoup . All in a moment 's time our eyes , our chests , our stomachswere choked . We could n't breathe : we could n't think : we could hardly make the effort to get ourselves past the tent-flap and into the open air . When we had clean air in our lungs again , we hoisted Neal on our shoulders until , clinging to the flagpole , he could cut away the cap of oakum around the apex of the tent and slash holes in the canvas . Through them a spurt of discolored smoke went drifting out to sea . That night , when we had recovered from our sickness and the fire was burning with a clear flame , the captain was generous with the store of beef ; and we , taking turns in charring it over the bright fire , found it delicious .. . heartening . . . and gave no thought to its origin.  |p240If  we had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger and dazed by the smoke within that tent , I doubt that Graystock and Saver would ever have been put on watch that night . They had been spared most of the labors that had drugged the rest of us and so they were assigned to stand fire-watch  --  the last watch before daybreak . Perhaps this had come about because of their constant malingering  --  because of their repeated insistence that they were too weak to work ; because of the filth in which they lay in spite of our freely expressed disgust . Perhaps , because of all this , we had come to feel that they were too weak to be harmful , too helpless to be dangerous . I know now , of course , that those who seem weakest and most harmless are the greatest threat to any society , and the most to be feared . Richard Nason and Captain Dean had been right in looking askance at that southeast wind , for its gusts grew stronger and stronger : then snow came whirling in at thep241top of the tent . Sometimes the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to glowing . At other times it beat at the blaze with icy fingers , flattening the smoke around us . God only knows how Saver and Graystock had discoveredwhere Neal had hidden our reserves of meat entrustedto him by Captain Dean . Perhaps they had loosened the foot of the tent and watched him when he first hid it , or when he went back to thicken the protecting seaweed above it . But discovered it had been . Thanks to the warmth of that ineffable fire , I had truly slept that night , instead of shivering in a sort of intermittentnightmare ; but before dawn on that tempestuous Wednesday morning , I came to my senses to find Neal prodding me . The captain , too , was awake , because I saw the glimmer of his eyes in the light of the fire . Beside the fire sat Graystock , feeding it with bits of tarred rope , and inching forward the end of a board , drying it above the flame . I could see the surface of the board boiling and sizzling in the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to my ear , so that I could hear his whisper . He could have shouted without being heard by Graystock , because of the pounding of the breakers . " Saver went out , " Neal said . " I heard him talking to Graystock . He went to get meat . " " He could n't do it , " I whispered back . " He could n't find his way . His feet would n't let him . " " He knew where it was , " Neal said , " and he could n't wait . " So we lay motionless ; and out of the snowy darkness came Saver , that complaining , querulous , inert , filth/smeared lout : that weak-willed laggard , incapable  --  according to his own whining protests  --  of standing on his feet . For three long weeks he had battened on our sympathies  --  and now , coated with snow , he stood on those supposedly useless feet , grinning as he readjusted the tentflap , and drew from beneath the oakum coat that others had woven for him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the tent for him  --  and skinned for him , and dismembered for him , and boned out for him , and rolled and tied for him  --  because he was too weak to do any of those things himself . Too weak , indeed ! His determination to live on others was as the strength of ten ! They were delighted with themselves , Graystock and Saver were ! They grinned and tittered as they crouched over the fire , carving little chunks from that roll of meat , impaling them on the points of their knives , and placing them carefully on the glowing coals . The odor of the roasting meat filled the tent , piercing and mouth-watering . Captain Dean got carefully to his knees . When Saver and Graystock speared the roasted chunks with their knife points and popped them into their mouths , he reached out with those long arms of his , seized each one by a shoulder and pulled both of them flat on their backs . " Get up , all ! " Captain Dean shouted to the rest of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught red-handed , their mouths crammed with the meat they should have defended with their lives . Animals steal food that belong to others  --  unless they 're trained . Then they ca n't be made to steal their master 's food ! Look well at these two ! Not men ! Untrained animals ! "  |p243He  picked up the roll of meat and gave it to Neal to hold . " You , Saver ! You , Graystock ! What do you have to say for yourselves ? " " I heard a seagull , " Saver quavered . " I was afraid the seagulls might get it . I was going to divide it as soon as daylight came . " Langman snorted . " There has n't been a seagull near this island since I killed the one we ate . " " There 's nothing on this earth worse than an ingrate , " Captain Dean said slowly . " You 're an ingrate , Saver ! Graystock , you 're an ingrate ! Ingrates never change , no matter how much they 're coddled and babied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get more , they steal the belongings or the good name of those that coddle ' em ! " Graystock pointed at Saver . " He was the one ! He knew where it was ! I did n't do anything . " The captain laughed . " You 've both bitten the hands that fed you . How do you say , those of you who 've been bitten ? How should these ingrates be punished ? " " I 've wanted ' em out of the tent , " Langman said , " ever since they started fouling themselves . I say put ' em out ! Let ' em get along the best they can ! " " Make ' em wash their clothes in salt water , " Henry Dean said . " Make ' em strip to the skin and wash , starting now . " " Why waste time on ' em ? " White said . " Let 's kill ' em ! Let 's kill ' em quick ! " " We 'd be justified in doing so , " Captain Dean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of us there were . He was a careful , good man . He wo n't forget anything he saw here  --  ever ! "  |p244Contem|platively  he added , " But White 's suggestion has merit . This would be a much better world if it were rid of its ingrates . " " Most ingrates do n't recognize themselves as ingrates , " I reminded the captain . " They 'd put up a strong argument as to why they should n't be killed . " " I suppose so , " the captain said , " and most of ' em , probably , would think they 'd made out quite a case for themselves . Anyway , we ca n't kill Graystock and Saver , much as they deserve killing . " " You could send them out to bring in all the meat that 's left , " Neal suggested . " They know where it is . If all the meat were divided now , we would n't have to stand watch to make sure they did n't steal the rest . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Graystock and Saver , hand over your knives . Then go out and clean yourselves . After that , bring back what 's left of the meat . There are three pieces . Bring back the seaweed it 's covered with , too . And do n't eat any part of those three pieces of meat ! If you do , I swear to God we 'll throw both of you in the surf . " Protesting , Saver and Graystock stumbled out into the snow . There was a pallid gray light in the east , so that they could see where to put their feet . How Saver had made that journey in the pitch-dark is something Saver himself could n't have answered . Perhaps if a man has an animal 's craving for something , a mysterious inner sense guides him safely to it . What with the snow and the high seas and the thick slabs of meat that Captain Dean gave us , we hardly moved from the tent all day . We took turns roasting slivers ofp245meat , stoking the fire , and dozing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to anyone who has known a real fire in a real fireplace ; colder , far colder than the Bodleian at its coldest ; but a bit of heavenly radiance to us who had lived so long in a frigid hell . We looked , of course , toward shore , but not in hopefulness . No vessel could have approached Boon Island in that abominable storm , and we were afraid , even , to speculate as to when Nason might reach Portsmouth . We knew in our hearts that he and his little sloop , with that unexpected wind to harry them , might never have reached Portsmouth at all.  |p246The  snow stopped , the wind dropped , the tent was warm , and we must have slept like logs ; for when I woke , we were sitting up , all ten of us , wild-eyed , hair on end . I was vaguely conscious , in the recesses of my mind , that a gun had been fired : that I was still hearing its echo . The tide was almost dead low : the sea had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that the tops of the swells had a slick look  --  and rising and falling on those rollers was a craft so sturdy , so smart , so daring in the way she slipped around those brown ledge-fingers , almost touching them , that I could n't shout , or even speak . All I could do was stand there , empty of thought , devoid of sensation , barely alive . The little vessel was odd-looking . She had a high sharp bow and an even higher sharp stern , and under her boom rested a broad , high-sided skiff with a narrow , flat bottom . There were five men on her deck , one lying out on the short bowsprit watching for ledges , one at her tiller , one reloadingthe musket that had aroused us , and two wrestling the skiff over the side.  | " That 's a pink , " Captain Dean said in a strangled voice . " Nothing like ' em to nose in and out of a rocky coast . " Captain Dean lowered himself halfway down the seaweed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let go an anchor : then joined those at work on the skiff . The man at the tiller left it , took two coils of rope and tossed them into the skiff : then four men slid her into the water and jumped in . One made fast a rope to the bow : another did the same in the stern , tossing the unattached end of the rope to the man who had held the tiller . The man in the bow stood up , cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted to Captain Dean . His voice carried strongly to us on that gentle but frost-laden land breeze . " The dory 's made fast astern . We 'll pay out easy . When we 're close enough , we 'll throw the bow rope ashore . Get some men down there with you and lay onto that bow rope . Hold it taut so we ca n't be swamped . " Two of the men in the dory stood up , pushing at oars . They faced in the direction they were rowing , which seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought numbly , for a rower to be able to see where he was going , instead of turning his back to his objective and seeing nothing , as do rowers in England . I wondered why these Americans had to be so different , sailing something called a pink , sharp at both ends : recklessly approaching ledges in a fiat-bottomed dory instead of a skiff : standing up to row so to face forward . I looked around for someone to help the captain . Only Neal , Langman and White had come from the tent . Thep248others must be helpless , sick , probably , from too much meat , too much smoke , the unaccustomed warmth . The four of us joined the captain . When the man in the dory 's bow tossed us the rope , we fumbled for it , caught it and clumsily took it high up onto solid rock , above the seaweed . The dory , held bow and stern , jerked at the ropes like a fractious horse . The newcomers picked their way over the seaweed and stood looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boulder . I never saw such incredulity as was written on their faces . Captain Dean , testing the hitch , looked up at the foremostof those sturdy heaven-sent figures . " You probably do n't remember me , " he said . " We 'd pretty near lost hope --  " His voice broke . All four men stared at us , their brows wrinkled , their mouths half open . The man Captain Dean had addressed seemed both horrified and puzzled . " Nason said I 'd find John Dean here , " he said . " I 'd like to --  " " I 'm John Dean , " the captain said . " You 're Furber . " He turned to another . " You 're Captain Long . I  --  I  --  I --  " He sat down suddenly on a boulder , clasped his hands around his middle and rocked himself back and forth . Long and Furber jumped forward and hoisted him to his feet . Long patted his back . Furber held his upper arm with both hands . " We caught the outgoing tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nason said to hurry , so we hurried . You 'll be all right , John ! " He hesitated and asked uncertainly , " You 're John Dean of Twickenham ? " " Jasper 's brother , " Captain Dean said . " 1 ' 11 be all rightp249when I get away from these damned breakers ! Ca n't seem to hear a thing ! Where 's Nason ? " " He 's in Portsmouth , " Furber said . " He ran into a southeast squall and piled up on Kittery Point . Too much of a hurry to get back , I guess . He lost his sloop , but he got word to Colonel Pepperrell , and Colonel Pepperrell got word to us . We sail Pepperrell 's ships , John . " " We got gruel aboard the pink , John , " Captain Long said . " You 'll feel different when you get some gruel into you . " He spoke to the two silent sailors , who were examining us as if we were dangerous animals in cages . " Put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long , " Captain Dean said in a shaking voice . " And Jethro Furber ! I never thought I 'd see the day ! " " Now , John , " Captain Long said . " We 'll have you out of here in a jiffy . " He took Captain Dean 's arm and steered him toward the dory . " Take the others first , " Captain Dean said . " They 're in the tent . Had our first fire last night  --  breathed a lot of smoke . Tent smells pretty bad . Things were n't easy . I had to stop trying to drive ' em . " " You ca n't drive ' em if you 're human , " Captain Furber said . Captain Dean 's voice was suddenly shrill . " Flurry up and help those others . We ca n't tend this rope all day . " Captain Long , Captain Furber and the two seamen scuttled off toward the tent as rapidly as anyone could move across those snowy , icy rocks . Captain Dean rubbed his face with both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd know Furber anywhere.  |p250Name  of Jethro . Only Jethro I ever saw . Used to keep running into him  --  Antigua , Halifax . Where was I ? Oh yes , he sailed under John Frost . John married Mary Pepperrell . Pepperrells marry all over . Is John Frost here with Furber ? Or is it Long ? I met John 's wife once . " I saw his mind was wandering . When I went to help him , he half turned , put out his hands gropingly and fell heavily . Neal tried to lift him up . " Let him alone , " I said . " Let him rest . He 's been through a lot . A rest wo n't hurt him . " Long , Furber and their two sailors came cautiously to us , each one carrying a man on his back . " The captain had a fall , " I told Captain Long . " The fire smoked last night  --  tarred rope  --  no wood . I think he 's a little tired . " " I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I 'm in command here ! Put Dean in the dory right now . " He pointed at Neal . " Put him in , too . That 's two passengersand two to row . " He signaled to the man on the pink , who tightened the dory 's stern rope . " All right , " Captain Long said to Captain Furber . " Slack away on that bow cable . Hold it tight till she 's halfway out . " We stowed the captain in the dory : Neal got in by himself . The two rowers faced the pink , and when a roller lifted the dory , they dug in their oars and pushed hard . Aboard the pink the man pulled at the stern rope . The dory went stern-first as readily as bow-first . " How many left in the tent ? " I asked Captain Long.  | " We could n't see , " he said . " We brought out four . Who are they ? " I looked at them , sprawled just above the seaweed . They all seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  bearded , foul , horrible-looking . " One 's the captain 's brother , " I said . " I think the others are Graystock and Saver and Gray . Gray was a gunner . " I could n't remember what it was that Captain Long had asked me , and so shook my head . Captain Long , seeing that I was confused , reached out and slapped my cheek , so to jolt me back to reality . " No offense meant , " he said . " Who else is there ? Have we got ' em all ? " " Let 's see , " I said , " Neal and Langman and the captain and I hauled in on the bow rope . That 's four . Yes , and White . That 's five . You took out four . That 's nine . There must be another in the tent . Mellen . He can walk . It must have been that damned smoke . That 's ten . There were fourteen to begin with . " Captain Furber nudged Captain Long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They went as close to the water 's edge as they could , watching the dory lift with the surges , rock toward us , pushed by the two sailors . When one of them tossed the bow rope ashore , the two captains belayed it around the same boulder we 'd used . The rowers climbed out and hurried back to the tent . Captain Long came to stand beside me . " Nason told us there were twelve : that two were lost on the raft , though only one was found . " " No , " I said , " there were fourteen . The cook died of lung complaint . We set him adrift . Then the carpenterp252died . The men wanted to eat him . We finished him up last night . " Captain Long took me by the shoulder . I saw he once more thought my mind was troubled , and was about to slap me to sensibility again . " I 'm all right , " I said , pushing his hand away . " You 'd have done the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long . " I was against it , " he shouted . " I said it was barbarous , unchristian and a sin ! " Captain Long dropped his eyes from mine : then looked hard at Langman . " So you did n't eat him ? " he asked . " I did n't eat him as Chips Bullock , " Langman explained earnestly . " I did n't eat him the day he was skinned . I only ate him the next day , when he was beef . " " That 's a nice distinction , " Captain Long said . He became suddenly irascible , impatiently lifted Henry Dean , and shouted at Saver , Graystock and Gray . " Get on your feet ! Stow yourself in that dory ! " He pointed a stubby finger at Langman . " Help ' em if they need help ; then get in yourself ! Do n't stand around ! All we need is a capful of wind to be stuck on this damned island ourselves ! God knows how you stood it ! I could n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His two seamen came back , pushing and pulling at Mellen . " Get him in ! Get him in ! " Captain Long shouted . He tapped me on the shoulder and pointed to the southwest . There , coming up fast , were two schooners and a brigantine , all three of them running before the wind . " Word 's got around , " Captain Long said . " And that wind has shifted ! Pack ' em in ! Pack ' em in ! " Five minutes later I was hauled over the side of the pink ,  |p253her  anchor was up , and we were moving to the westward . Between us and that miserable island there was the mist of breaking seas and the haze of cold air above salt water . That island had visited upon us every conceivable form of misery , disappointment and torture , but it had n't been able to destroy us , and in spite of my aches and my discomfort , I felt a great peace  --  a blissful quiet . Around me men spoke quietly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the breeze in the rigging : the screaking of the boom against the mast : the faint rustle of the seas along the hull . The world , after an eternity , was blessedly silent once more . Gone forever , thank God , was the deafening tumult of breakers , bellowing and roaringlike furious beasts determined to destroy our minds as well as our bodies . The brigantine and the two schooners hove to and waited for the pink to come within hailing distance : then cruised along on either side and spoke us . " Get ' em all ? " they shouted . " Anything we can do ? " Long used his speaking trumpet . " We got ' em all . Ten of ' em . If you beat us in , see there 's canoes at Pepperrell 's Wharf in Portsmouth . Take word to Dr. Packer . Get barbers . Find Nason and see what he 's arranged . " The skippers of the three vessels nodded vigorously : held their hands clasped high in air and shook them . Captain Long resumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're lousy , all of ' em ! Plenty of bandages ! All kinds of ointments ! " One of the skippers , perched in the ratlins , bawled , " How many days on the island ? " " Twenty-four , " Captain Long shouted.  |p254The  skipper slid down from the ratlins , and I could see the crews talking and gesticulating . I knew they did n't believe it . The three vessels sheered away from the pink and drew ahead , as if racing for Portsmouth . A sailor brought me a tot of rum and a slice of bread . " Captain 's orders , " he said . The rum burned my gullet and went heatedly around in my stomach . My first bite of bread had a flat taste , but the second was better : the last better still . The same sailor came back with a cup of gruel and stood before me while I drank it . Then he quickly took the mug from me and moved to a distance . " I 'll stand here so you wo n't fall overboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant until the pink skittered on the top of a wave , then sank sideways down it . On that my ears roared , my insides were contorted , and everything in me churned up and out . I hung over the pink 's bulwarks while the sailor held my knees . This , I thought , was death . Dimly I heard the sailor say soothingly , " This 'll clean you out . Everyone was sick after the gruel , even the cap-tain . " Just at that moment I did n't care what had happened to the captain . I did n't even care what happened to me . I was seasick . Pepperrell 's Wharf was crowded when the pink slid alongside it at dusk . It was a mystery to me why so many hundreds had gathered on that wharf to see a few scarecrows , but in spite of the bitter January cold there were hundreds of them , women and men , too . Almost all hadp255lanterns made of pierced tin . They were somehow different from any such throng that might collect in Greenwich . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangdog-looking folk , and deformed , dwarfed people , slyly seeking pockets to pick . Those of substance would have been smaller and would have seemed contemptuous . Almost certainly there would have been some who jeered , or laughed raucously at our hairiness and raggedness and queer oakum garments . But those hundreds on Pepperrell 's Wharf stood straight , had solidity , and all of them , without exception , were concerned about us . They were compassionate people , deeply interested in our welfare . When I was helped over the bulwarks and saw all those solicitous eyes , glittering in the light from their upheld lanterns , I could n't help gulping to think that strangers should be so kind . Nason came from the crowd to lower me into a canoe with Neal . " You 're going to Captain Furber 's , " he said . " Captain Dean 's going there , too . He 's already gone . " He put his hand on Neal 's shoulder . " I 'll see you tomorrow , " he said . " We 're all your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The canoeman took us a short distance downstream , helped us ashore , pulled his canoe half up the bank , and motioned us to follow him . " Tell us where it is , " I said , " and we 'll go there . You do n't need to leave your canoe . " " Why not ? " he asked . " Someone might steal it . " He looked baffled : then urged us forward , between two warehouses and across a street to a two-and-a-half-story wooden house . The door of the house was open and beforep256it stood two women and three children , all peering in through the doorway . Our canoeman touched one of the women on the shoulder . She stifled a cry and whirled to face him . At the sight of us , she pressed her hand to her lips and shrank back , drawing the children against her skirts . They were pretty little plump things , and I had the thought that has come to me , against my will , a thousand thousand times since then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large arm or heavy buttocks  --  the thought that , if the need arose , that child or that woman would make good eating . No wonder the women were afraid of us ! " What 's the matter , ma'am ? " the canoeman asked . " I was told by Captain Nason to bring these people here , orders of Captain Furber , and Captain Dean 's already been brought here . " " Oh , " the woman said , " he frightened us to death , just the look of him . When he stood here and started to speak to us , we screamed and ran out . He went in . I think he 's in the kitchen . " " Well , go on in , " the canoeman said , " and take these two with you . Treat ' em the same way you 'd want CaptainFurber to be treated if he 'd been cast away on Boon Island for a month . " " Only for twenty-four days , " Neal said . Mrs. Furber looked at Neal : looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Only twenty-four days ! You come in the house , right this minute ! " Captain Dean was in the kitchen , as Mrs. Furber had suspected . On the fire he had found an iron kettle filled with beef stew , and had forked out pieces of beef and turnipsp257and potatoes , and had covered the top of the kitchen table with them to let them cool . " I 'm sorry , ma'am , " he said to Mrs. Furber . " When you screamed and ran out , I figured the wise thing to do was to stay here instead of running after you and maybe frighteningyou and the children even more . " He looked at the children in what he doubtless thought was a genial manner ; but I knew too well that he was entertainingthe same understandable thought that had passed through my head  --  that they would be tenderer to eat than Chips Bullock had been . Mrs. Furber 's initial horror was passing . " You ca n't have all that beef and vegetables you 've put out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And just because you 're starved is no reason you should n't eat like human beings . " She brought a bowl and three plates , forked a moderate amount from the table top to each plate ; then put the remainder in the bowl . " Now , " she said , " that 's all you can have ! " " Ma'am , " Neal said . " I 'll ask you to put us in the room where we 'll stay . We 'd better eat there . " " Well I never ! " Mrs. Furber exclaimed . Neal scratched himself deliberately , first his head : then his arm . " Well , " Mrs. Furber said , " we 'll put you in the barn . There 's three stalls and a summer oven , and lots of hay and blankets . When you 're cleaned up , we 'll move you to the house . " There was a knock on the door . Mrs. Furber opened it to admit three men  --  Dr. Packer and two barbers . The doctor took one look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and follow him . To Mrs. Furber he said , " Bring us hot water as often as you can . And get tubs . If you 've only got one , borrow two from the neighbors . " I can hear Dr. Packer 's voice , after all these years , exclaimingover our sores and over our feet . " It 's a miracle , " he said over and over . " I 've got to send word to Boston ! Urine and oakum ? Seaweed ? God knows ! But it 's a miracle , all the same ! " Warmth , blankets , soft hay on which to lie , clean bodies , shorn heads , shaved faces , white bandages , soothing ointments ! I felt as the sailors of Ulysses must have felt , when freed of Circe 's spell.  |p259I  waked , the next morning , to the sound of jingling , faint and far off , could n't remember where I was , and sat up straight on my hay-stuffed mattress , half frightened by not hearing the unending roaring of those Boon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lavender . Lavender , of all things , instead of the stenches of our Boon Island tent ! The jingling sound went on and on . Captain Dean spoke up from the adjoining stall . " Sleigh bells ! People moving around ! Probably there 'll be a few of ' ern come to see us today . Probably they 'll want to know all about us . We 'd better decide on what we 'll tell ' em about Neal . " " That 's simple enough , is n't it ? " I asked . " He learned to read and write while working for my father . And my father got to know him because Neal 's father was in the Naval Hospital . " " Yes , " Captain Dean said . " That 's close enough . Are you listening , Neal ? " From a third stall Neal politely said he was.  | " Probably , " the captain went on cheerfully , " we wo n't have occasion to say much . Shipwrecked sailors are n't a novelty nowadays , considering how our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them wrecked . These New Hampshire people are n't much different , probably . " Probably ! Probably ! How little Captain Dean knew about America , in spite of the high opinion he 'd expressed to us in the harbor of Killybegs concerning the people of Portsmouth . How little anyone , anywhere , knows about America ! About its insatiable curiosity concerning the welfare of others ! About its generous eagerness to help strangers achieve the same health and happiness that its own citizens enjoy ! About its limitless resources : its enormous latent strength ! And above all , about its friendliness to those who deserve its friendship : its implacable detestation of false men and evil measures ! Captain Furber came banging at the door that led from the barn to the woodshed , which in turn opened into the kitchen . With him he carried a kettle of fish chowder , three bowls , a ladle and three spoons . " Haddock ! " Captain Furber said portentously . " The Woman "  --  and I took The Woman to be Mrs. Furber  --  " cooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onions and potatoes and fish in another . Then she makes a mess of pork scraps , and breaks up some ship 's bread , and mixes ' em all up with the liquor from the bones . Every sea captainin Portsmouth claims his wife makes the best fish chowder in the world , but I 'll put The Woman 's up against any of ' em . It 's the liquor from the heads and the backbones that grows hair on your chest ! "  |p261He  ladled the stew into the bowls ; then discoursed while we rolled that hot and fragrant chowder over our tongues , crunching the pork scraps through the soft and savory ship 's bread , the tender haddock and the melting potatoes . My toes , what there were left of them , would have curled , if that had been possible , at the life-giving sweetness that trickled down my throat . " The Woman , " Captain Furber said , " makes fried pies that would stand a dead Indian right up on his feet . Doc Packer 's in there now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few for you , but Doc Packer said No . There 's a couple of nurses coming over  --  Governor Wentworth authorized ' em  --  and Doc Packer says maybe you can have one fried pie apiece along about four bells . " As a seeming afterthought he said , " There 's been people coming around with stuff already , but Doc Packer says they ca n't come in till after he 's looked at you . He says maybe some of ' em can come in after you have your dinner . " " What sort of stuff ? " Captain Dean asked . " Oh , knitted small clothes , " Captain Furber said . " Linen shirts . Woolen stockings . Big parcel from Mrs. John Brewster  --  the one that was scalped . Good woman . Got a silver plate in her head to close up a hatchet hole . Hair never grew back , so she wears a wig . Kind of starchylookingwoman , but she softens up considerably toward those who 've been in trouble . I 'll have a table brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Packer came in , followed by two women in gray dresses . One , the Widow Hubbard , was short and stout and had a luxuriant mustache . The other , Widow Macklin , was tall and cheerful-looking with a cast in one eye thatp262made her seem to be examining a distant object when in reality she was looking straight ahead . " Now then , " Dr. Packer said to Captain Dean , " we 'll have off these bandages . Colonel Pepperrell sent word he wants to see you as soon as you 're fit to be seen . There 's some others too . They want to hear all about it . How do they think I 'll get around to seeing all my other patients if I yap , yap , yap all day about you ! " The nurses brought buckets and rags , stoked the fire , swept the barn floor and set up a table for the gifts CaptainFurber had mentioned . As the doctor sopped at our legs and feet with rags dipped in the concoction in one of the buckets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much ? " he asked . When we said No : no more than an aching tooth , he demandedfurther details about the treatment our feet had received after the cutting off of our boots . " There 's something here I ought to get to the bottom of , " he mumbled again and again . " You 'd lost toenails when you cut off your boots , and some toes came off when you washed ' em in urine . Then you put on pieces of linen and some layers of oakum . Then you went out on the rock and kept getting your feet wet , and had no fire . " We said that was correct . " Hurt much ? " he asked again . Captain Dean said  --  and Neal and I agreed  --  that the most painful of all was when we put our hands in water to loosen mussels . We tried to explain to him the excruciating agony that almost paralyzed us after the fifth or sixth immersion ; but pain , of course , ca n't be described.  | " Mussels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mussels have anything to do with it ? " We did n't know . " And you ate seaweed every day , " he ruminated . " Could seaweed be a remedy against frostbite ? " " I do n't know why I made ' em eat seaweed , " the captain said . " I knew we had to eat it . There was n't much of anything else till Chips Bullock died . The fat from Chips 's kidneys helped us a little . You 'd better not forget to mentionkidney fat if you make a report to those Boston doctors . It certainly eased the pain in our feet and legs . " " It 's annoying , " Dr. Packer said . " We ca n't go out to Boon Island and carry on experiments under the conditionsyou encountered , because in the first place nobody 'd be such an idiot as to go there under those conditions ; and in the second place , everybody that went would die before we found out anything . Exasperating ! " " How long before we 'll be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Packer said , " we could move you to an upstairs room today , if you felt you 'd like to get out of this barn and into a comfortable bed . " " I do n't want to , " Captain Dean said . " I 'd feel choked in a comfortable bed . I 'd rather stay here , where we can practice walking again with only about half our feet . " Dr. Packer looked relieved . " That 's the best thing to do  --  stay where you 'll be out from under foot , and handy to the privy . " " How 's my brother ? " Captain Dean asked . " How 's the rest of ' em ? " " Your brother 's all right , " Dr. Packer said . " He 's just  |p264the  same as you . He lost toes , the same as you did ; but when they fell off , they sort of healed themselves , just like those lizards down in Antigua , that shed their tails if you so much as look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew he 'd sailed there  --  probably in one of Pepperrell 's vessels . " When can I see my brother ? " Captain Dean asked . " Since you 'll stay here in the barn , " Dr. Packer said , " I think I 'll move him over here later today . I do n't think much of the sailors he 's with . If I tell ' em they can have a certain amount to eat , they eat three times as much . " " Saver and Graystock , " the captain said . " I 'll be glad to have Henry here where I can keep an eye on him . " The doctor eyed Captain Dean peculiarly . " You 've got some others that 'll bear watching , " he said . " I know , " Captain Dean said . " Langman and Mellen and White . " " If I was you , I would n't trust ' em , " Dr. Packer said . The captain snorted . " I do n't trust ' em as far as I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earliest days I had seen , wherever I 'd gone in England , beggars of all sorts pleading , imploring , praying for alms , for food , for cast-off clothing ; but never had I seen generosity freely offered . Now , in Portsmouth , where beggars were unknown , I saw what I would never have believed , unless I had seen it with my own eyes  --  an outpouringof all the good things of this earth to people , strangers , who had suffered adversity during the same storms which had howled around the sheltered homes of their benefactors.  |p265Ca|ptain  Furber complained and fulminated at the surplus offerings of money , piles of clothing , fur hats , flowered weskits , boots and shoes that accumulated in his best room  --  the room unused , except for funerals and weddings , in the front left corner of every large Portsmouthhouse . No matter how rapidly Widow Hubbard and Widow Macklin sorted them into piles of three  --  one pile for ourselves , one for Langman , White and Mellen in the Motley house , and the third for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they continued to accumulate , so that Captain Furber , at Neal 's suggestion , tacked to his front door a card reading , " The Grateful Survivors of Boon Island Have More Than Enough . " Another thing for which Neal was responsible was the writing of letters of thanks to those who had left their names with their offerings . " People like to be thanked , " Neal said , " but my father said most people forget to teach their children to say thank you . ' So if Captain Furber will buy us some paper , I 'll write the letters . " More people came to see us or call on us than I would have believed lived in Portsmouth . Merchants , sea captains , tavern keepers , King 's Councillors , Lieutenant Governor John Wentworth , John Plaisted , Theodore Atkinson , Colonel William Pepperrell , Richard Nason , Robert Almory , Roger Swaine , Edward Toogood  --  fine men : the finest , barring my father and Captain Dean and Swede Butler , I ever met . Every one of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Packer was solicitous about our welfare , and in a few weeks ' time I had more offers of positionsthan I would have had in England in half a century.  |p266As  for Neal , word had gone around concerning the manner of his father 's death , and everyone who saw him was instantly seized with the idea of planning his future . Colonel William Pepperrell and his partner Governor Wentworth came to call on our second day in Portsmouth . Everything , Governor Wentworth said , would be done for us , and at the expense of the Province of New Hampshire . We were entranced by his elegance , his affability , and the attentiveness with which he listened to our answers to his questions . His companion , Colonel Pepperrell , seemed more remote  --  more interested in scrutinizing the ceiling than in listening to us . Then Colonel Pepperrell came again alone . Neal , when the colonel walked in , was sitting at our gift-table . The gifts had been pushed away from the end at which he sat , and his pen was scratching diligently at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to the table , picked up one of the lettersand read it aloud : " Hugh Gunnison , Esqre . The officers and the crew of the Nottingham Galley wish to express to you their profound gratitude for your sympathy and your kindness to them after their rescue by the citizens of Kittery and Portsmouth from their bitter days on Boon Island . " John Dean , Master " Colonel Pepperrell was a broad , powerful man with a bulldog face , and he waved the letter exultantly . " Look at that ! I read every word of it , easier than print ! Takesp267two men to translate my writing . " He narrowed his eyes at Neal . " Where 'd you learn to write ? " Neal stood up . " In Greenwich , sir . " " He 's to work for my father , " I said , " in law and in-surance . " " Law ! " Colonel Pepperrell cried . " Quibble , quibble , quibble ! That 's no life for you , my boy ! Here , sit down ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off half your foot . " " I do n't know how much he took off , sir . It feels no worse than it did before he trimmed it . " " Yes , " Colonel Pepperrell said . " I see ! " He looked carelesslyat Neal , glanced at Captain Dean and me : then seemed to come to a decision . He spoke thoughtfully and jerkily , almost as if meditatingaloud . " I talked to John Wentworth about you . Twice . Slow man , I am , like folks in Devonshire . Think slowly but make up my mind quick . Always wanted to go to America , but could n't make up my mind to go till I was sixteen . Then I went quick . " " My brother jasper speaks of you often , Colonel , " CaptainDean said . " He heard all about you from David Water-house . " Colonel Pepperrell looked mellow . " Yes . Handles my accounts in England . " His eyes strayed back to Neal . " Must n't wander from subject , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen . I can write , but what I write I ca n't read . William junior ca n't write at all , and of course he ca n't read my writing either . He 's got to learn to write , because my other son Andrew 's at sea , learning the things a shipowner needs to know . Andrew 's delicate . He could n't have come through Boon Island the way you people did . "  |p268He  tilted back in his chair and ran his eyes over us , a shrewd , farseeing old man , wondering , I suspected , whether he could have endured Boon Island . " I know a little about England , " he said . " I ought to . I was born in Revelstoke , near Plymouth . I did n't like it . It 's no place for a man without money . Upper classes everywhere protecting themselves from lower classes , and with good reason ! " He snorted . " Been thinking some of going back to Revelstoke : buying a few hundred acres in the country : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply , as if to get our reactions . I , for one , had none . " The thing that stops me is William Junior . I 've built a big business . William Junior 's got to write letters to me about the business , so I can buy books and learn to chase foxes at Revelstoke ! Chase foxes ! Those fools that chase foxes never kept hens . If they ever had , they 'd kill all the foxes before they had a chance to grow up ! " He clucked disparagingly at himself . " Wander , wander from the subject ! Now here : we got no schools . Imagine that ! John Wentworth says he 's going to build a school with his own money , but he has n't done it , and William Junior still ca n't write . Time 's getting short ! Nine vessels I 've got  --  one of ' em picked you up  --  the pink Joanna . " He named them , ticking them off on thick fisherman 's fingers : " Ship Frenchie , brigantine William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fellowship , sloop Nonesuch , sloop Olive , sloop Merrimac . " He looked proud , and he had reason . The poor boy from Revelstoke had truly prospered . " You know what that means , " Colonel Pepperrell went on . " It means having our accounts handled in half a dozen  |p269|ports   --  invoices  --  letters of instruction to captains , enough letters to drive anyone crazy . " He pounded the table . " William Junior has got to learn to write , and you , young Butler , have got to learn him . " Neal quickly wrote the word " teach " on a scrap of paper , and showed it to the colonel . " Yes , yes ! " the colonel said . " That 's what I meant , but do n't start me wandering ! The point is , William Junior is a problem . He gets into bad habits . He goes over to Bray 's and gets into the pigpens and rides the pigs . Then he comes home and hides his boots where his mother can smell ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He leaned forward and fixed Neal with a steely eye . " Well , " Neal said , " I half promised --  " " I know what you half promised ! " Colonel Pepperrell said . " You half promised Richard Nason you 'd go with him to see where your father was lost ! Well , I 've had a talk with Richard Nason . He lost his sloop coming back from Boon Island  --  no fault of his . I 've made him captain of one of mine . We 'll both of us take you to where we think your father was lost . " At the look on Neal 's face he turned suddenly toward Captain Dean and me . " Well , what about it ? " " If I had such an offer , " Captain Dean said , " I 'd say Boon Island was worth it . " " What about you , Whitworth ? " the colonel demanded . " His father would have been  --  probably is  --  mighty grateful , " I said . " Then that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see a lot of each other before the two of you are healed up and ready to take one of my ships to Barbados . "  |p270Ca|ptain  Dean drew a deep breath . " I 'd feared something like this , " he said . " Feared ! " Colonel Pepperrell protested . " Yes , feared , " Captain Dean said . " Feared that I might not be able to take advantage of such an offer . There 's something you do n't know --  " " You probably mean Langman , " the colonel said . " Well , John Wentworth and I know all about Langman . He 's jealous because you 're getting all the attention  --  because everybody 's stopped going to see him and his two cronies . As soon as he began telling everyone that you purposely ran the Nottingham ashore on Boon Island , Portsmouth had a bellyful of Langman . My God , Dean , this is a seafaringtown ! Do you think anybody over the age of three and a half would believe that anyone  --  anyone at all  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , run a vessel on Boon Island in a northeaster ? And in the dead of winter ? Pish ! Portsmouth does n't want people like Langman and his fellow conspirators around . They 've been in the Motley house , but the Motleys have ordered them out . " " Colonel , " I said , " we know people like yourselves and these wonderful friends we 've made in Portsmouth would n't believe Langman ; but people in England are n't like that . Those around the docks believe anything they hear about people of property or position . They 're too ignorant to investigate  --  to find out the truth . They have no judgment . From the first Langman has hated Captain Dean , and we 've never known why . Perhaps it 's because bad men always hate good men , and rejoice in their downfall . " At all events , if Langnian has started telling his lies  --   |p271though  he gave the captain his word of honor that he would n't  --  then he 'll keep right on . He 'll tell them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even have them printed . Then there 's no escaping the fact that the captain will have to tell his own story , with two witnesses . Even then there 'll be so many to believe Langman 's lies that Jasper Dean 's home and even his life may be in danger from mobs . In all likelihood Langman will drag my father into it , for my father handled Captain Dean 's insurance . We 're mighty grateful to you , Colonel , but I 'm afraid this means that Captain Dean and Henry Dean and I must go back to England . " Colonel Pepperrell glowered at us , his eyes belying the thin line of his lips . " I never go back on my word , " he said . " There 'll always be room for the Deans and Miles Whitworthin the Pepperrell fleet  --  and when your feet are healed , we want all of you at Kittery Point , so you can see Neal Butler in the surroundings I hope he 'll always call his home . " Our worst fears were justified when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Langman , Mellen and White were to appear before his friend Samuel Penhallow , a justice of the peace , to take oath that Captain Dean had deliberately run the Nottingham ashore and that Captain Dean had in addition treated Langman in a barbarous and inhumane manner . The colonel went with us to Justice Penhallow 's residenceon the following day to hear Langrnan , Mellen and White swear to the truth of a tale that put anything in the fairy tales of Edmund Spenser to shame . Justice Penhallow looked up at Langman before writing his signature . Hep272did n't say a word : he did n't need to . He just looked . Then he raised his eyebrows at Colonel Pepperrell . " Any comments , Colonel Pepperrell ? " The colonel asked politely , " Would I make any commentsif you swore that the moon was a netful of sar-dines ? " Justice Penhallow signed the paper , pushed it across his desk , and without a word stood up and opened the door for Langman , White and Mellen to go out . He came back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to be done in a case like that , " he said . " If you could spare the time and the money , you might prosecute him for perjury , but you 'd do yourself more harm than good . That man would feel honored to be noticed , but he 'd never be noticed by anyone worthy of the name of mar-iner . " We took our departure from Pepperrell 's Cove on a soft April morning , with the southeast breeze bringing us the sweet Maine odors of young willows , damp beaches and newly turned earth . A shipowner could n't want a pleasanter cove than Pepperrell 's . It was shielded from the sea by the spruces of Odiorne 's Point and Champernowne 's Island , and from the north by the hills behind Braveboat Harbor . It was a safe anchorage , always , and I hated to leave it ; but our testy good friend Colonel Pepperrell had arranged for Captain Dean , Henry Dean and myself to sail from it on one of his brigantines . Langman he avoided as he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Langman and his lies , " the colonel told me disgustedly , " you and Captain Dean would be working for me today , instead of wasting the best time ofp273year doing nothing ! John Wentworth wanted me to provideLangman and his cronies with passage on this same brigantine , and at government expense . I 'd see ' em in hell first ! Let the British Navy take charge of Langman and his two dogfish , I told John . All three of ' em need a taste of the cat every day or two , just to remind ' em to be human ! Drat such dod-ratted truth-twisters , and drat the fools who always believe ' em ! " The colonel eyed his son William , the problem child , with disfavor . He and Neal Butler stood beside me on the colonel 's wharf . I 'd always thought of Neal as a younger brother , but he suddenly seemed grown up , and to me his new friend William did n't look like a problem : he looked like a young man who 'd be handy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Neal and William stood half the population of Kittery Point , studiously scanning the cloudless sky , as if they had found themselves near the wharf purely by accident . By now I had come to know these Maine people a little , and I suspected why they were there . They wanted us to know they were resentful of any person who expected them to believe that Captain Dean would have wrecked a ship on Boon Island in a Decembernortheaster . Under most conditions they were patient ; but when aroused , they took steps . " Seems to me , " the colonel said severely to his son , " you 'd be better off up at the house , learning to write . " " Yes , sir , " Neal said , " but we figured you would n't mind if we said a final word to Miles about coming back . Also I wanted to tell him something . " " Well , go ahead and tell him , " the colonel said . " I wanted to tell him that someday I 'd try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for us  --  here . "  |p274The  colonel looked from Neal and William to Captain Dean and me . He cleared his throat . " Why , " he said , " that 's all right . Under the circumstances , both of you can have the day off . " " Yes , sir , " William said , " and I 'd like to say that if Miles will come back , there 's quite a few things we 'd like to show him when summer 's here . It 's pretty country  --  a lot different from Boon Island . " The colonel blew his nose loudly . " Oh my , yes , " he said . " I talk about going back to Revelstoke , but I 'll never do it ! " I tried to speak , but could n't . They had us by the arms , urging and helping us into the long boat . There was a flutteringof hands and a babel of cries . The oars rattled in the thole pins ; the gulls squalled and squealed overhead ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , who could tell ? God , if we 're fortunate , is good to us . How many of us have our Boon Islands ? And how many have our Langmans ? But does n't each one of us have an inner America on which in youth his heart is set ; and if  --  because of age , or greed , or weakness of will , or circumstancesbeyond his poor control  --  it escapes him , his life , to my way of thinking , has been wasted.  |p275In  1745 Captain Moses Butler of Kittery served under Lieutenant General William Pepperrell in the attack on the French fortress of Louisburg on Cape Breton . He led the 7th Company , and fought with distinction at the taking of the Royal Battery , the Island Battery , and in scouting attacks on the French and Indians in the wilderness to the westward . The fortress surrendered on June 17th , 1745 , and there was great rejoicing in Kittery , York , Berwick , Wells , Arundel , Biddeford , Falmouth and places farther to the eastward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wentworth . His daughter Sarah married Joshua Nason of Arundel . Captain John Dean so successfully defended himself against Langman 's attacks that he was made His Majesty 's Consul for the Ports of Flanders , residing at Ostend , and held his post for many years. **25;9822;TOOLONG the window that went sixty feet up from dock level ; and the shaky union scale that rose every foot after twenty-. five . An eight-hour day at two-seventy per hour for ten days , the foreman made a mental estimate of what he could claim on the books . " I 'll pay you a buck-fifty an hour to paint that stack , Son . " Dove came scurrying back up the gangplank like the flightlessKiwi , a bird not built to fly . He heard the foreman holler from window to deck , " Put this man in the chair , boys ! " By the time he reached the deck the scrapers , brushes , paint and thinner were ready . Dove jumped right into the bosun 's chair and shouted , " Haul steady , maties ! " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deck . " Okay , boys ! " he called down cheerfully , " I 'll start here ' n work up ! " But the chain kept going higher . Who would ever have thought such a fine breeze would be stirring here while other fellows had to sweat out the heat below ? He was about to take a second look but the chair began to swing like a cradle and he changed his mind . Up and up . Above him leaned the rust-flaked stack , below the river tilted oddly . The hands of his watch seemed strangely bent , but seemed to say 1o:55 . Good  --  in five minutes he 'd have his tools together so he could begin right on the hour . A full day 's pay for a full day 's work , that was the way to rise in the world . " Beginnin ' , maties ! " he called over the side , " Beginnin ' ! " That should show them he was no coward . Something tugged at the chair and he understood the foremanhad had a change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dove whipped the rope fast around the stack , and knotted it with the last of his strength . By God , the man had sent him up , he was n't going to get him down without a day 's pay in hand . Once fastened , the chair steadied and so did Dove . Not enough to stand upright , but enough to get the lid off the WILD SIDE 101paint can . Just as he got it off , the wind tilted the chair and the tinned oil spilled . He dabbed it off his jeans . " Lucky it did n't get my shoes , " he took the happier view . No use taking a chance on ruining his shoes altogether with a wind that tricky sneaking around . He clamped the lid back on and glanced at his watch : 11:04 . By God , just because a man could n't read did n't mean he could n't count . That was a dime he 'd made already today or he 'd know the reason why . That was when he looked right over the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking up . He closed his eyes to keep from heaving . That would never do the first day on the job . When his stomach had steadied he remembered something and found , in the bottom of a Bull Durham sack , just what he was looking for : a palm-full of light green potoguaya and a couple of brown papers . " Was n't told nothin ' about not smokin ' on the job , " he argued sensibly . And at the first drag felt the chair rise an inch . " Let her rise , " he thought , " the higher we go the higher the pay . " Scraper , thinner , bucket and brush lay at his feet forgotten ; as he had apparently been forgotten by those below . When he looked at his watch again it was almost two . My , how time did fly . " Lunch ! " he shouted over the side , " bring her up ! " But saw no one climbing the rigging one-handed , tray in the other , to ask whether he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hogs are at chow , " he thought sullenly , " stuffin ' theirselves like a set of sows . Struck me right off as a sorry lookin ' crew . " All through the treetop afternoon Dove dozed , and every time he woke , woke hungrier.  | " Chow ! " he tried for ' his dinner one more time . But all he got was a wave from a deck-hand far below . " I know your play , " he finally informed the foreman aloud , " you 're tryin ' to starve me down . But you wont do it till I got a full day comin ' , friend . " And went right back on the nod . It was almost five when he wakened again , feeling a chill breeze pass . He unlooped the draw-rope . " Good thing I did n't have lunch , " Dove thought going down , and hopped out onto the deck , pale and swaying . Two of the crew had to hold him up and every man but the foreman looked pleased with his work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foreman let him know right off . " Mention money and I 'll heave you right over the side ! " Dove got his landlegs under him . " Mister , I went up in your fool chair like you asked me . We made a bargain . " " Now you listen here to me , son . I 'm Chief-by-Jesus foremanof this everlastingly damned dry dock , I 'll have you under-goddamn-stand that . I 'm not to be dic-hellfire-tated to by you or anyone . Is that the Christian-Killing-Moses clear or not ? I can make it mother-murdering clearer if you want . " " A bargain , mister . " " Talk sense , boy . " " I 'm a-talkin ' sense , mister , ' n you leave mothers out of this . I were aloft six hour , not chargin ' you for overtime because I realize I did n't do too well my first day . But I tried six dollar worth . " The foreman took Dove by the arm , led him to one side and whispered , " Take this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . It was a two dollar bill . " I got six comin ' , mister . " " As high as I go . " He had changed it for a fiver . " I 'll settle . " Dove took it . The foreman went wearily to the rail , looking downriver and out to sea.  |p103Down  on the dock Dove took one last look up . The little man at the rail was grinning down . He waved the big brush at Dove . " Be work on time tomorrow , matey ! " he called . Dove waved back . Mighty mannerable fellow . Yet felt a lingering sadness as he left the big river to know he was n't going to sea after all . Later that day he discovered the door of the men 's room in the Southern Railway Station barred by a white-haired Negroporter . " Excuse me , pappy , " Dove tried to get past . " Country boy , you got colored blood ? " Pappy demanded . " Naturally it ai nt white , " Dove told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned him , " I 'm responsiblehere . " Dove did n't know what was wrong . He jusfelt elt wrong . And left the REST ROOM FOR COLORED in retreat . He was bending above the water-fountain when he saw the porter coming at him again . The old man had been searching for someone like this in dreams for years . " You got colored blood , you caint drink this water . " " Ai nt everybody got colored blood , mister ? " By this time Dove really wanted to know . " You think you make a fool of me with fool questions , " the old man answered , " but all you make a fool of is yourself . Boy , if you white , stay white . If you black , stay black and die . Now get out of my station and out of my sight . " " It purely wonders me , " Dove brooded thoughtfully , " Why , a Christian do n't scarcely stand a chance for a drink of water in town no more . Looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His throat felt parched and he turned into the first doorwayhe saw with a Coca Cola sign over it . Coca Cola signs went all around this shady nook with nothing on its shelves but empty cokes . He rapped the counter with a dime . A little brassiereless beauty , a real fence-corner peach allp104of nineteen appeared , opened a coke on a nail hooked to the counter , and let her shoulder strap slip to bare her left breast to its tinted nipple . Under the breast was tattooed the single word  --  Whiskey . " Ai nt this the By-Goddest weather you ever seen ? " Dove asked . " I 've seen By-Godder , " the fence-corner peach replied . " Now I reckon I got a nickel change comin ' , m'am , " Dove reckoned . " Reckon you awready got your change "  --  and replaced the strap , looking bored . " You do n't feel maybe you made a slight errow , m'am ? " " Right sure . " " How much fer a stror ? " " Help yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , " Dove marveled , taking four straws in an effort to get even , " you 're the second person in the past hour noted that . I.Iowever do folks tell ? " The peach merely looked blank . When the straws would draw no more he bent each carefully and put down another dime . This time she wiped the bottle with a counter cloth and slipped in a single straw . 1 le took it from her with his eyes glued to that left strap . It did n't slip an inch . But she rang up his dime and slammed the register so fast , just as the right strap fell away , that he thought she had punched the machine with the nipple . Now she merely leaned on the machine , resting the breast on the NO SALE sign . Underneath this one was tattooed -- Beer . Dove studied the word solemnly . " Do you mind if I spend an opinion , Miss ? Somethin ' a bit personal ? " he asked at last . " Nothing you could tell me could possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a mite too much whitenin ' on , " he told her all the same , " it make you look plumb puny . "  |p105The  blankness of her regard surpassed itself . She did n't so much as blink . Just tipped the bottle 's last drop out , put the bottle away and replaced her strap . " M'am , I ca n't help thinking there 's something dead up the tree . " She raised one pencilled brow in the mildest of inquiries . " Yes ? " " Last night I bought a sody the other side of the station ' n it were only five cents . " " That 's the other side of the station . They got a price war there . " " Hope nobody got kilt , " he hoped and put down a third dime . This time she opened the bottle , wiped it off , inserted the straw , rang up the dime , shut the register and steppj d back all in a single motion . Yet the strap failed to fall . Dove drank slower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single day m'am ? " " ' Bout as many as there are crows at a hog-killin ' , " she made a close guess . " Why , that 's a good few , " Dove decided . " What did you come in here for , mister ? " " Got barred from the water-founting . " " I think you 're wasting your money . " " After all , it 's my money . " " And so long as it 's money , it 's a-plenty , " she pointed out  --  " but when it 's all spent it can get right scarce . " " I 've heard that some times money do n't hardly last till it 's gone , that 's true . Or so I 've been told . You think my fortydollarmight last that long ? " " You spend it all on cokes it wont , if you follow me . " " I do n't follow you too near . All I know is this coke tastus right fine . " " It what ? "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a dollar down here ? " " Try one . " Dove put it down and she had snapped it up before it touched the counter . " Now see if you can follow me . " Somewhere at the bottom of that narrow passage a girl was laughing mirthlessly like a girl laughing at herself , and all its doors were numbered . No light , no window , no sound . Dove stood lost in a burningblackout till he heard someone hooking a door . Then a littlegreen light came up in a corner and the beer-and-whiskey beauty stood stripped to her slippers in a glow , a girl delicate as a deer . " Never did see such a purty girl afore even though you are a mite scarce-hipped , " he told her . " I 'm gittin ' a mighty urr to lewdle . Would you care to lewdle too ? " Later , with one foot planted on the floor to keep himself from falling off the narrow cot , he grew confidential . " My stomach is swoll , " he told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and added , " Country boy , your time is long up . " Then hooking his trousers on one green-tinted toenail , derricked and dropped them with dainty disdain across his knees at the same moment that his wallet dropped from the pocket and curiously vanishedbeneath the sheets . " M'am , " Dove declared , " you are the very darnedest galpersonever I have met up with . " " How 's that ? " she sounded suspicious about something . " Why , them toenails . " " You 've had your money 's worth and more , " she decided as though suddenly resolved not to be good friends after all . " Get dressed and get out . " " I 'm just layin ' here gettin ' myself up an apology to you , m'am . I 'll have it done quite soon . "  | " Apology for what ? " " Why , for callin ' you scarce-hipped like I done . There was no call for my takin ' an advantage such as that . As a matter of fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " The bathroom 's to the right . " " M'am , I 'm right sorry , indeed and double-deed I am . But the fact is I 'm plumb fatigued and now I got to rest a spell . " She padded around the bed and peered out into the hall . " I 'll get a party who 'll restore your strength , " she promised . Her back was to him , her hand on the knob and the pocket of her parade pantie bulged with his wallet so plainly he could see the grain of the leather through the sheer of the cloth ; but he did n't try to snatch it . Instead he hooked a fingertip in the rubber-band that bound it , stiffened , his arm exactly as he had just seen her stiffen her leg , and thus derrickedit as neatly and nervelessly as she had derricked his pants . She sensed a slight movement behind her and whirled toward the bed . There the big boob lay pretending to sleep and anyone could see at a glance he was faking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 're fooling , but it is n't me , " she gave him final warning and stepped into the hall  --  " Knifey ! Knifey-Love ! A party to meet you ! " Dove sprang out of the cot , into his pants and was out the window shoes in hand . Two Negro girls directly across the way , watching for men to come out the front  --  they spent their afternoons keepingcount  --  appeared mildly surprised to see one come out the window instead . How do you count that ? Someone , it seemed , was forever thinking up ways of doingthings that no one else had thought up before . There 's one advantage women have over men : they can go down to hell and come straight up again . An old songp108says so and it says just right . Yet it fails to allow for special cases like Dove Linkhorn 's . Dove knew he 'd been underground all right . The moment he stepped back onto the Canal Street side of the Southern Railway Station it seemed he had either come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The city fathers , Do-Right Daddies and all of that , Shriners , Kiwanians , Legionaires , Knights of this and Knights of that , would admit with a laugh that New Orleans was hell . But that hell itself had been built spang in the center of town  --  this they never could admit . For panders and whores are a plain disgrace , and Do-Right Daddies are family men whose families are part of themselves like their backs . But not many a daddy ( do-right or do-wrong ) is satisfied simply to own a back . He has to kick loose of home and fireside now and again . He has to ball with outlaws , play the fool on the door-rock , and have a handsome hustler call him by his first name in the presence of an out-of-town friend . That makes daddy feel like a man again . Three shots of corn likker and the whole stuffed zoo  --  Moose , Elks , Woodmen , Lions , Thirty-Third Degree Owls and Forty-Fourth Degree Field Mice begin to conspire against the very laws they themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slug of whiskey from your own flask in a taxi , but forbidden on a trolley-car . That did n't help those who rode trolley-cars . You could n't carry liquor down the street , but if you owned a car you just bypassed that . For every statute they had a little loophole  --  that by coincidence fitted their own figures as if measured for them . Those who had no hand in writing statutes  --  panders and madams and such as that  --  had a harder time squeezing through . It was an ancestral treachery that all do-righters practice . When opening time was closing time and everyone was there , down where you lay your money down , where it 's every/thing but square , where hungry young hustlers hustle dissatisfiedold cats and ancient glass-eyed satyrs make passes at bandrats ; where it 's leaping on the tables , where it 's howlinglowdown blues , when it 's everything to gain and not a thing to lose  --  when it 's all bought and paid for then there 's always one thing sure : it 's some do-right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peep shows , geeks and freaks street . It was n't panders who owned the shows . There were all down old Perdido Street . But it was n't geeks who ran that chippified blondes and elderly rounders , bummies and rummiesand amateur martyrs . There were creepers and kleptoes and zanies and dipsoes . It was night bright as day , it was day dark as night , but stuffed shirts and do-righties owned those shows . For a Do-Right Daddy is right fond of money and still he do n't hate fun . He charged the girls double for joint-togs and drinks , rent , fines , towel service and such . But before any night 's ball was done , he joined in the fun . Later he had to be purged of guilt so he could sleep with his wife again . That was where the pulpit came in . There had to be something official like that to put the onus on the women . The preachers , reformers , priests and such did this work well . Some girls were just naturally bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In no case was it ever the fault of anyone who profited by the shows . Daddy , you can go home again . Pulpit , press , police and politicians pushed the women from crib to crib and street to street  --  yet never pushed any but diseased ones out of reach . Daddy still wanted some healthy good-looker available for his weekend and there had to be a retriever to fetch her . That was what helped keep pulpits filled , increased newspaper circulation , made the arrest blotterslook respectable and gave politicians a record to ride . When we get more houses than we can live in , more carsp110than we can ride in , more food than we can eat ourselves , the only one way of getting richer is by cutting off those who do n't have enough . If everybody has more than enough , what good is my more-than-enough ? What good is a wide meadow open to everyone ? It is n't until others are fenced out that the open pasture begins to have real value . What good is being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lieutenant ? What good is a second lieutenant for that matter ? The girls themselves read of the latest crusade , but their eyes skimmed idly over the print . When the last sermon was preached , the last editorial written and the last raid done , then those who had preached , written and raided would be coming down to see them for a bit of fun again . That was the ancestral treachery no one would admit . Yet over the treachery , under the revelry , there hung , that airless summer , a feeling that this was all as sad as hi-jinks in an invaded land . In the ravaged faces of young girls and the painted faces of boys in secret bars there hung the sense of impending defeat . Lonely bones of the old French Graveyard , that had slept contented decades through , felt it and wakened to work their dusty way out through brick , through wood , through stone . Dove Linkhorn , passing a crumbling wall , peered in and saw how harshly death dealt with old bones . Old bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchman , Creole and Kentuckian , bones of sailor and hunter alike , women of honor and women kept , all bones bleached the same in the Saturday sun . They too had been to Hell and come up again . Dove 's own bones felt sore . " Too dern much runnin ' ' n jumpin ' , " he scolded himself , " nothin ' to show for it but a suit of clothes ' n a pair of shoes ' n a dollar watch . Things could be worse . " When a girl with eyes that could only have been gotten inp111a box of tacks demanded , " Boy , you got a dolla ? " Dove did n't feel it was right to lie to her . " I got a dolla , " he admitted , " but I do n't feel like foolin ' . " She opened the door . " Come in here . I 'll make you feel like foolin ' . " Ten minutes later Dove came out hungry enough to eat snake . There was a poor-boy sign at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach it another girl stopped him by swinging a screen door right in his path . " Boy , you got a dolla ? " " I got a dolla but I need it for eatin ' . " " You can eat here , " she promised him . He stepped inside . It did n't look like a restaurant . /Ten minutes later he came out , leaned a moment against the crib , then proceeded slowly , head down to get past the rest of the doors till he came to the sign with the poor-boy painted on it . But when he looked inside all he saw was one more brassiereless girl opening a coke . He shuffled on and on , block after block , finding his way toward food more by scent than by sight . And so at last entered a certain sea-cave acrawl with the living smells of lobster and shrimp , steaming with simmering oyster stew and awash with gumbo in which little snails paddledabout . He sat at a table as scarred and aged as the Old French Market itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he discerneda Negro the size of Carnera , naked to the waist and shining with iron-colored sweat , decapitating snapping turtles with silvered precision . Now the trouble with turtles is that they believe all things come to him who will but struggle . There 's always room at the top for one more , they think . And in this strange faith the snapping kind is of all the most devout . For it 's precisely that that makes them the snapping kind . Though the way bep112steep and bloody , that does n't matter so long as you reach the top of the bleeding heap . The dark butcher looked to Dove like Doctor Death in person . Doctor Death whose patients come one by one along an ever-narrowing plank , each confident of ultimate mercy : a last-minute reprieve , with full civilian rights restored  --  the knife would snap in mid-air , a modern miracle . Death was all right for certain classes , sand turtles and such , but did n't suit noble old sea-going families of true terrapin lineage . Losing his head did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloodier heights . Say Not The Struggle Naught Availeth , Onward and Upward was the cry . Indeed , once the knife had done him in , to raise oneself in the world became more urgent than ever . Sensing that time was against him , he worked all the harder to succeed . Till the floor about the pyramid streamed black with blood , with some on their backs and some on their bellies . Dove felt another 's eyes watching the growing pile : down on the floor beside him a severed terrapin 's head , big as his own hand , stared cataleptically at its own body slipping and flipping up the distant heap . It could be no other 's body , for it alone matched the king-sized head that stared with faith unshakable . Stepping on the stumps of a hundred bleeding necks , haulingitself over other hacks , giving one a kick there and one a shove there , the body sent a dozen rival climbers sprawling over the cliff to failure . Dove and the I lead watched together to see if the Body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of others , wadingcontentedly over mothers and orphans , it got its blind flippers at last onto the tail of a red snapper , hauled itself onto the snapper 's back , pushed Red out from under and landed smack in the middle of the heap.  |p113113He  was the King of the Turtles . The king waved his arrogant flippers triumphantly  --  " Alwaysroom for one more at the top "  --  just as something bumped him hard from behind and his short day was done . Sliding , sprawling , skidding , he slipped off the heap in a bloody skein and landed flat on his back below the table wigwagging frantically . " Dear friends and gentle hearts , " he wigwagged , feeling the final cold creep up  --  " Will you stand by to leave your old friend die ? I wanted nothing for myself  --  money , comfort , power , security  --  I worked for these only because those dear to me wanted them . ( Of course , as long as they were handy I shared them from time to time . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ True , I ate well . But that was only to keep up my strength for the sacrificial ordeal of my days . For I never knowingly harmed a fellow creature unless he got in my way . I never took unfair advantage unless it profited me . Can you really leave so lovely a turtle to die ? " A devoted father , a loyal citizen , a faithful employee , a kind employer , a considerate neighbor , a regular church-goer . Out of purity of heart I respected the laws of God and man . Purity , and fear of jail . Could you really stand by and watch so saintly a turtle die ? " I seemed a bit intent a moment ago , you say , on grinding my brothers ' necks to gristle ? I confess  --  but that was a momentago , and now I 've changed my ways . Could you bear to see such an open-minded turtle die ? " Life me up , lift me up , gentle hearts  --  lift me up to let me look one last time at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And with that most slowly drew in his dark tail . His flippersgrew rigid . His struggles forever ceased . The wisest of turtles was dead.  |p114Just  as Bing Crosby came onto the juke singing I Ai nt Got Nobody . " What 'll it be , boy ? " the waiter asked . Dove did n't hesitate . " I 'll take the tarpon soup . " He did n't yet know that there was also room for one more at the bottom.  |p117IN  THE cheery old summer of ' 31 New Orleans offered almost unlimited opportunities to ambitious young men of neat appearance willing to begin at the bottom and work their way up the Ladder of Success rung by rung . Those with better sense began at the top and worked their way down , that route being faster . In the cheery old summer of ' 3 r some states were dry and some states were wet . Russ Columbo was singing Please . Al Capone was quoting Mark Twain and someone held women to be equal in aviation to men . A woman refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legion claimed that state legislatures were handicapping sales of products turned out by the American working man . A New York minister discovered that Jerusalem had had a worse administration than Jimmy Walker 's and said he 'd rather live under Hoover any day than Hezekiah . The excesses of that year were due to a backward swing of the moral pendulum , Harry Emerson Fosdick proclaimed , adding that if the saloon were still around it would be even worse . The President pressed a button in Washington that lit a fifty-two million dollar building , highest yet raised by the hand of man , at Thirty-Fourth Street and Fifth Avenue in New York . Wallace Beery was saying What I Like About a Mama is Plenty of Mama and cotton prices dropped to a new low.  |p118The  Ladder of Success had been inverted , the top was the bottom , and the bottom was the top . Leaders of men still sporting gold watches were lugging baby photographs door to door with their soles flapping . Physicians were out selling skin tighteners and ship captains queued in hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great fire insurance companies went up in smoke , which seemed no more than just . When the fire department  --  long unpaid  --  cleared off , little remained but scorched files , swivel-chairs on which no one would ever swivel again , lovely heaps of frosted glass , and all that mahogany . All that mahogany that had n't helped anybody but brokers after all . Then the brokers began jumping off rooftops with no greater consideration for those passing below than they 'd had when their luck was running . Emperors of industry snatched all the loose cash on which they could lay hand and made one fast last run . Lawyers sued one another just to keep in practice . And every bughouse had one little usurer hidden away in a cell all his own where he did nothing but figure percent with his fingernail on the wall , day after day after day . In less time than it takes to say God with your mouth open , the go-getting door-to-door canvasser became the backboneof the American economy . Ile went to work for RealsilkHose or Hoover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Realsilk hose or a second-hand sweeper by stealing it part by part . There was also small change , milk money and such , left lying about on shelves and sills while housewives studied one proposition or another . Changesnatchingtoo came under the head of go-getting , for hundredssubsisted upon it week in and week out . However , the secretary of the Federation of Labor pointed out , Business was resisting further decline . Self-reliance for the penniless and government aid to those who already had more than they could use was the plan.  |p119But  park benches were wet of a morning whether it rained or no ; and it was possible to tire even of bananas . Still and all times were n't as hard as some people grew fond of pretending . All that had happened really was a withdrawal from abnormal prosperity with business progressing on a downward grade toward new planes of normality and increasingequalization of opportunity . In short , we were going full steam ahead . Only this time one exciting opportunity was precisely as good as the next exciting opportunity . Which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . The pimps alone did n't seem to catch on that the country was progressing downward to new rates of normality . They had been progressing downward for some time without ever-i4 knowing that they were in style . Now of a sudden they discoveredthemselves with more girls than beds to put them on . Scarcely-twenties looking for a daddy , any old daddy who 'd tell them where to lie down . Landlords and landladies passed them on to the cabbies and the cabbies passed them on to the pimps . It was then , between prostitution and Prohibition , that the ancient color line was finally breached . Negro bellboys had gained a virtual monopoly on the deliveryof illicit alcohol and had found that white male guests either wanted a woman with the bottle or a bottle with the woman . This errand boys ' work evolved into soliciting . Immediately , he looked with scorn upon his own women . Like the Negro policeman , the Negro ponce was harder on his own people than was the white pander . He saw now at first hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all : that " good " white folks never acted like bad black ones . For he saw men and women with the best names in town , the do-right names , howling like wolves in the Saturday stews , panties on the bedpost and pants on the floor , yet knew Do-Right Daddy would be back with his family , come Sunday morning , in the pew with the best name in town.  |p120The  Negro began losing his awe of the white women there and then . He gave her the choice of moving over or being turned in to the law . The errand boy became an informer as well as solicitor . Times were n't as bad , he felt , as the papers made out . Everyone was out soliciting in one commodity or another . Everyone was pecking somebody else 's door . The whole town was out pecking , nobody stayed home to buy . Either you rapped doors on commission or you organized a chance of fools even sillier than yourself into crews and took your commission out of theirs . And since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theoretical too . If , for example , you swindled a housewife into signing for delivery of two pounds of coffee twice a week for twelve weeks , you received two theoretical dollars for perpetrating the swindle . Actually , however , you had swindled her for nothing , because the driver accredited himself with the order  --  " that party changed her mind . You know how women are , " he advised the door-to-door man . The driver in turn was victimized by the device of deductingtwo dollars from his regular salary in lieu of that same housewife 's deuce . By the time that the deuce had found its way from wife to owner 's pocket , there was n't a man on the street crew who had been on it the week before . Dove Linkhorn , now in a seersucker suit and sea-green tie , stood on the corner of Calhoun and Magnolia . That here stood a man far above the blue jean and Bull Durham class was plain to be seen , for he was smoking a Picayune . Indeed , he lacked only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Ladder of Success as fast as the next ambitious boy . So when he saw men encircling someone or something down the street he hurried there as fast as his butter-colored shoes could make steps , in hope that someone was throwing a fit . But all it was was a little round man with something glisten-.  |p121ing  in his hand . Dove elbowed in to see what glistened so nicely . Cawfee pot . Hello , pot . Shor a purty old pot . " Wreneger 's the name , " the little round man was telling his crew , " but you boys call me plain old Smiley ' because that 's what all my good buddies call me . And you know what I tell my good buddies ? I tell them , Goodbuddies , if you ai nt sellin ' you just ai nt tryin ' , ' that 's what I tell my good buddies . And that 's what I 'm tellin ' every one of you , ' cause you all my good buddies too . " Little old red ' n green cawfee pot . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The idea ai nt to see how many doors you can rah of a morning  --  that ai nt sellin ' . That ai nt even tryin ' . If you only rap two doors a whole morning and sell both , then you 're tryin ' . " I had me a cawfee pot like you , cawfee pot , I 'd know where to get the chicory for you . " Heed the housewife 's woes , boys . Give ear to her trials and little cares . Make her joys your joys , her tears your tears . If you listen long enough sooner or later she 's going to ask , Young man , whatever is that contraption in your hand ? ' " " Look like a cawfee pot to me , " Dove helped the man out . " Thank you , Red . You work with me . The rest of you men split up two to a block , one down one side and one down the other and meet me back here at noon . If you ai nt sellin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good old goodbuddy buddies . " " Dirt-eatin ' buggers , every one , " Smiley assured Dove the moment they 'd scattered . " Do n't you think 1 know what they 're up to ? Got a pencil and a receipt book so they 're going to make out five or six phony orders with addresses of empty lots ' n then go drink derail in Lafayette Square thinkin ' Old Dominion pays off on their lousy word . " Hep122banged Dove 's big back good-naturedly  --  " They 'll find out better soon enough , wo n't they goodbuddy ? " " They sure will , mister , " Dove agreed gleefully . " That 's why I was so careful about choosing you , " Smiley grew serious . " I told myself , There now is one face I can truly trust . ' " " I truly trustes you too , Mister , " Dove replied , feeling happierby the minute . " I want you right beside me while I pitch , Red . Because when you pitch for Old Dominion you 're pitchin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mister , " Dove stopped short to offer Smiley his hand , " you 're talkin ' about my team now ! " Smiley shook perfunctorily . He was n't used to being taken literally , it made him unsure of himself . " The first thing to remember , son , is our own Confederate dead . When the housewife asks you how much coffee does she have to buy before the pot is legally redeemed  --  some are sharper than you might expect  --  tell her you 're J. E. B. Stuart 's grandson and your daddy is dying in Memphis . Tell her anything except that she has to take fifty pounds before she owns the pot . If she wants to know what percent of chicory we use say something about Chanccllorsville . " " I 'LL SAY I WORK FOR OLD IX ) MINION ! " Dove cried with sogenuine a pride that Wrcneger , one of those men who like to say It ca n't get hot enough for mc , ' felt curiously wilted . " Stand to one side , son , 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he invited Dove into the shade of a small unpainted porch , allowinghim to guard one of the pots . " We ai nt buying no coffee pot , mister , " the housewife assured Smiley the moment she saw the hardware in his hand . Smiley fixed his face as if to eat mush out of a churn . " It 's not a pot , Madam . And it 's strictly not for sale . It 's a French Dripolator and it 's a goodwill gift , no strings attached , from Old Dominion to you . Take it . It belongs to you . "  | " I 'm greatly obliged , but we already got a pot . " The woman 's eyes shifted to the lopsided figure in the yellowknobshoes . " Jeb Stuart 's grandson ! " Dove came to attention . " At ease , " Smiley ordered below his breath and hurried into his pitch . " Madam , this here genuine French Dripolator is shortly goin ' on the market nationally for **27;9849;TOOLONG with a national campaign behind it . What we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it when they find they got the best cup of coffee in town . The kind who 'll want to share with their neighbors and spread the word about our offer . That 's the friendly sort of thing is going to give our national campaign a headstart  --  I said at ease  --  of course if you do n't care to cooperate I 'm sure the lady next door will be interested . " She 'd sooner risk the black death than have her next-door neighbor own something she did n't . Dove watched her sign for receipt of the pot wistfully . " Just a mere formality , " Smiley explained the need of her signature to the woman , " so 's the company wo n't think I sold it to my wife . " Even to Dove the laugh that followed sounded hollow . The fraud consummated , Smiley handed Dove a pencil , receipt book and pot . " But do n't let go of that thing till you got that signature , " was his parting warning . And off he went to lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Dominion . Dove was relieved that his goodbuddy had n't asked him if he knew how to use the pencil . It was real nice to have it to carry behind his ear all the same . He came to an intersection where one road led to town and the other away . The town road was festooned , street lamp to street lamp , with welcoming pennants ; it was wide and newly paved . The other was lampless and pennantless andp124plainly led nowhere at all . Without hesitation Dove chose the nowhere road . For that was the only place , in his heart of hearts , that he really wanted to go . Shuffling loosely along in his proud bright shoes , occasionallytucking in his sea-colored tie , he came to an ironwroughtfence where a Negro woman was shearing a bush ; and waited in hope she would look up and ask , " How do I get a pot like that ? " But all she did was study him , shears in hand , as if Old Dominion might have sent him out to rape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . He shifted the pot to his other hand . It was hanging so heavy he scolded it , " Pot , you give me the wearies . " And his shoes gave him such a punishing pinch , as though they were on the side of the pot . He came to a four-story tenement built flush to the broken walk to get the last inch of space , where another Negro girl , her face still full of an easy sleep , leaned an arm against a patched and rusted screen . Dove held up the pot to catch the sun . " Little of cawfee pot . Git it fer free . " She opened the door and grasped the pot 's handle , taking his word as fast as that . But Dove was a little too smart for her . he kept hold of the spout . " Got to sign your name for you Bits it . " " Signs you anythin ' , cawfee pot man . " She plucked the pencil off his ear and scribbled a name on a receipt blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dove knew . " Awntie and Mothaw might like pots too , " the girl told Dove , and hollered up the stair . Two older women , as if waiting for just such a call , came clumping so eagerly down the steps that they wedged in the narrow way  --  for a moment neither could gain an inch . Then worked themselves free and the winner came up breathlessly . " Whut you got now , lucky girl ? " " Got me a goddamn pot . "  | " You write for us , Minnie-Mae , then we gits too . " " My own handwrite is so poorly , Miss , " Dove confessed , " I 'd be most obliged if you 'd do just that . " Minnie-Mae snatched his receipt book , tore out two order blanks , scribbled on both and handed them back . " Old Dominion thanks you , Miss , " Dove assured her , " I 'll deliver both pots tomorrow . " " My girl-friend might like one too , " Minnie-Mae invited Dove to step one landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured her as she urged him ahead , with Awntie and Mothaw following heavily . It was just one of those days when everyone is on your side . For from window to window , lightless passage to lightless hall , the wakening whisper went  --  " Come git you a cawfee pot . " Doorway to door , to friend to foe , Awntie and Mothaw went spreading the word . Whether it was Huey Lang or Old Dominion giving things away again , nobody cared a doodle in a wood . Negroes dark or Negroes light , highyellow , blue-black , gold-toothed or toothless , everyone liked coffee . Minnie-Mae was ripping receipts and handing them for upreaching hands to sign and return as fast as she could reach and tear . " Come git yo ' goddamn pot ! " Dove could n't make out a word of the lingo ringing about  --  it was that Negro-to-Negro jargon that accents English like French and French like English then slurs the rest when white ears of any nation listen . Dove did n't care  --  he was getting rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the street for more . Businesswas progressing on a downward grade to new rates of normality , opportunity was being equalized , time was money . Wreneger , with two of the crew , were waiting for him at the corner . " Where you been , son ? " Without a word Dove handed him fifty orders , signed and sealed . Srniley 's aides , one a tow/ering Florida cracker and the other a pint-sized Georgian , crowded in to see how Texas did it . Smiley thumbed through the packet swiftly , thumbed part way back as though to make certain of something scarcely credible , then ripped it straight down the middle and fifty French Dripolators went blowing like confetti down Elysian Fields Avenue . Dove ran one down before he understood  --  then let it blow after the others like watching all hope die . " Goodbuddy "  --  a sort of soft horror had caught in Smiley 's throat  --  " Who told you we sold to Negras ? " Dove sat heavily on the curb , took off his left shoe and pressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Git up , boy . " Dove switched to the right-foot toes . They hurt like everything . " Face up to it , boy , " the Georgian urged him . " Got to face up , " the Floridan counseled him . Dove 's glance took in all three . " I resign from you-all , " he resigned from all three . Smiley bent swiftly , scooped up Dove 's proud shoes , handed the left to the Georgian and the right to the Floridan  --  " Whut 's it going to be , boy  --  pot or shoes ? " Dove , risen , found his voice at last  --  " Them shoes costes more ' n any ol ' tin pot ! " " Ai nt no ol ' tin pot , boy , " the Georgian defended Old Dominion , " you know right well that there 's a genuine French Dripolator . " " Get goin ' , son , " the Floridan advised him . Dove shuffled down the grass while Smiley padded the pavement the whole barefoot way back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door , " you wait here . I 'll git you back your sorry pot . " Smiley snapped open his watch , gave it a glance and closedp127it with a decisive click . " Do n't like to law a man , You got five minutes . " The moment Dove got a door between himself and Smiley he thought , " this might take more than five , " and latched it . Then poked his head inside the beaded curtain Minnie-Mae called a door . Her eyes glowed upon him from a farther corner like two plums in a bowl of cream . " Do n't stand half in and half out , cawfee man , " she invited him , " either come visit or go away . " Dove stepped inside , apologizing , " Do n't mean to appear ongrateful , miss , for you 've been pure-quill kind . But a certainparty has carried me back here account of one old coffeepot . Now ai nt that as sorry a circumstance as ever you heard tell ? " The girl was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slip . Somewhere in the room pu'hk was burning . But her own scent , burning more darkly than that , cut through it . " Why , where your fine yellow shoes , cawfee man ? " " The company 's holding them against that same pitiful pot . O miss , " Dove broke with the disappointment , " I do try my very hardest . Other boys rise without scarcely tryin '  --  Why do n't I rise like other boys ? " He covered his eyes with the back of his hand . " Why for very shame "  --  she took his hands down and caught them softly below her own along the rocker 's arms  --  " shame and double double shame on a great big cawfee man like you takin ' things so hard as this . Of course you 'll rise as high as other boys and likely even higher ! " " I 'm not as right sure of that as I once was , miss , however kind on your part to say so . You see , I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own and she let them press . " You do n't appear handicapped , cawfee man . " " In more ways than one , miss , " he leaned as he mourned ,  | " more ways than one . First , I ca n't so much as read my own name . For another , there 's a man right outside your door waitin ' to law me . Now if that ai nt as pitiful a set of circumstancesfor a country boy to overcome I never heard of pitifuller. " " 0 cawfee man , " she chided him tenderly , tucking his hands back below her own , " you are the biggest country fool ever to walk barefoot to town . Now tell me true  --  What color wuz that mizzly old pot you keep grievin ' so about ? " Dove rocked her forward to get a closer look at the pot , gleaming like a burnished treasure in the gloom on the mantel just above the girl 's head . " Mostly green , Miss . " Could he get a hand loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upsettin ' me "  --  and putting her feet wide behind him and her full weight forward , forced him to grasp the rocker back of her neck to keep from being upset himself.  --  " and a spot of red on the handle . " " 0 so you say "  --  she hooked her ankles behind his and her arms about his waist to help him keep his balance  --  " So you say , but who ever heard tell of a red ' n green cawfee pot ? I do n't think you 'd lie , yet it 's hard for a girl to believe  --  a red ' n green pot . " Yet for one in grave doubt her voice sounded curiously approving ; and let him rock her forward again . " What I really wants to know is do it make good cawfee ? " " Why , they tell me it cook pretty fair , miss . Yet it could be that they lied . It 's a thing I 'd not take another person 's word for , were I you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grinds my own . " " It 's always best do you grind your own , miss . For that way it 's much fresher . " " So you say . But what good is fresh if there ai nt enough to satisfy ? Mister , if you talkin " bout some little old scrawnysizepot I ai nt interested . What I needs is a great big pot , enough for both morning and night . "  | " So long as it make good cawfee , miss , size do n't scarcely matter . " " It matter a lot if it so small it boil over the minute your back is turned . " " This is a slow-boiler type pot , miss , " Dove recalled , rockingher back so far that her slip slid to her navel , " with a spot of red on the handle . " Minnie-Mae let her head rest on the chair 's cushioned back and looked up still unbelieving . " So you say . But you talks so smooth I begin to doubt you 's a country boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now ai nt you ? " Dove straightened up with a sudden pride . " I 'm purely country , miss , head to toe , and ai nt nothin ' to be ashamed of in that . It were n't town boys made our country great  --  when danger called it was country boys first to answer the call ! And many and many a barefoot boy has rose mighty high , though I do n't recall their names at the moment . Us country boys , we give our all !  --  O miss , if only someone would give me a chance to rise I would n't ask for pay . You do n't get rich askin ' for raises , that much I know . It 's the boys who were willing to work just for the experience got to be millionaires ! Miss , if I could just get my shoes back I 'm sure I 'd start to rise like others . " " Why you just said yourself boys without shoes rise more high than them that has them . Do n't handicap yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Someone tried the latch of the door , then padded softly off . Dove saw the pot almost within reach and felt himself gaining ground inch by inch . " Your belt-buckle botherin ' me , country-fool . " The old-fashioned rocker went creakety-creak . " Now grind cawfee and goddamn your country shoes ! " But Dove only stood waggling his loose tooth , carefully gauging the distance to the pot with his pants around his ankles . He got his little finger around the spout when hep130heard a swamp mosquito taxiing in : he knew it was a swamp mosquito because it had two motors . It raced down the runwayof his left buttock , rocked to a stop , then tried the flesh tentatively as if testing for density . Dove gave his rump a waggle to shake it loose and the movement cost the insect its footing . With the fury of any dignified individual shoved without warning into the street , it planted both feet to gain the greatest leverage and sank its avid proboscis so deep Dove leaped like a hare with the pang. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! 0 you cawfee-grinding cawfee man ! 0 you grind so good ! 0 you my cAwfiest cawfee man ! " The bug began drilling for bone but the girl gripped both his wrists . All Dove could do was waggle and jerk in a perfect frenzy and the harder he waggled and jerked the more resolved the bug grew to get a bit of bone . " I get you shoes ! I get you shirts ! I get you hats ' n all that ! O proud-size cawfee man ! "  --  then her voice was drowned in a grateful animal groaning  --  " Gazed ! Gawd ! Gawd ! " And with every " Gawd " she regained lost ground , climbing his back and forcing him further and further from the pot . By the time her ankles were locked behind his neck Dove knew he was losing territory fast . As the old-fashioned rocker went creakety-creak . " Out of that ! " The girl 's foot slipped around Dove 's chin and by her instep catapulted him as if he 'd been kicked by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smiley crashed through the window bringing sash , screen and all with him . Minnie-Mae met Smiley mid-room with the full momentum of the chair behind her  --  Dove shut his eyes at the soft solid wh000sh as her fist broke Smiley 's breath and his legs flew up and he landed even harder than had Dove . As an empty rocker went clickety-click.  | " I love a fool , " Dove heard the girl tell , " but you two suits me too well . " " One of them must be me , " Dove guessed , though she was looking down at Smiley with the pot in her hand . " Get out of here , cawfee fool , " she added , and Dove hopped to it , kangarooing right across Smiley  --  in mid-air a fat hand clasped his ankle  --  down he came once again . " Miscegenation ! " Smiley sat up roaring , hauling Dove in like he was something on a line . " Miscegenation ' n pot theft ! Dirt-eatin ' bugger ! Wheah 's my pot ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was once and for all by clanging it like a bell against his skull . Dove heard the tinny wannng , felt his ankle freed , sprawled across a chest and was out the window . He landed running , gripping his belt and pursued by an illusion that Smiley as right behind him with a screen around his neck , Minnie-Mae right behind Smiley with a dented pot and the law behind all wavinga billy three feet long . Dove did n't stop for breath till he 'd rounded four corners and saw no one was following after all . " Reckon I do take things a mite hard , " he thought , getting his buckle fastened at last . " Still , it do seem a great curiosity , how some boys rise so easy while others got to struggle so and lose their shoes in the struggle . Sometimes I almost think it 'd be money in my pocket if I 'd never been born . " Back on the corner of Calhoun and Magnolia he rested on the curb and sat looking at the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly . " I reckon I ought to start lookin ' for work , " he thought . " Do n't run , goodbuddy , " a towering shadow advised him . Craning his neck about , Dove saw the long Floridan and the half-pint Georgian . " Do n't need to run , goodbuddy , " the Georgian assured him , " we on your side now . "  | " Been on your side from the very start as a matter of fact . " " Too plumb beat to run anyhow , " Dove abandoned hope . Then saw that each bore a yellow shoe . He eyed both shoes with distaste . " Them durn things have nigh to destroy me , " he decided , " and they squeak like a new saddle besides . " " Man owns shoes as proud as these might one day try socks , " the long Floridan commented as he shod Dove 's outsizedleft foot  --  " soap ' n water would n't hurt none either , " he reflected , handing the right shoe to the Georgian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the smaller man marveled as he shod the right , " but it looks like it left six tracks in the barnyard . What part of the graveyard you sleep in last night ? " " Tried a hotel but the air was so close I just roamed till sun-up , like a bug on a hot night . " " Plenty room at our place , " the big man offered his hand while his voice rumbled like a bumblebee in a dry gourd . " My name is Luther but call me Fort , account Fort Myers is my home town . " " Mah name 's Luther too , " the little one offered a firmer grip , " jest call me Luke . " " Like the bullet said to the trigger , " Dove introduced himself , " Just tell me where to go . " " Did you have a little trouble back there with our friend ? " Fort asked while they crossed Canal at Tchoupitoulas . " If folks had n't pulled me off I 'd have whupped him before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparen to feather into him . " " That would have served him right , too , " Fort agreed , " he 's the kind whose pappy made his way by driving his niggers and now he 's trying to make his by driving whites . He 's picked up a bit of Yankee philosophy  --  you do n't work you do n't eat . No true Southern man would never put a choice like that to a fellow human , black or white . " Up a rickety backstair Fort pulled the string on a sixty/watt bulb . A room filled with a watery light , and mosquitoes buzzed in from the river . Dove saw a sink full of dirty dishes and a high brass bed precisely like another he had seen in his lost long-ago . " I 'll make out on the floor , " he offered . " Ai nt needful , " the Georgian pulled a curtain aside to disclosea cot in a sloping alcove . An empty gin-fifth rested there , uncorked , unlabeled and unclaimed : a bottle without a name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let it through , then closed quietly again . The bottle crashed below . " Who 's throwing things ? " Fort , in the other room , sounded startled . " Some nigger drunk pitchin ' glassware , " Luke replied lightly . " Ought to be lawed , " Fort decided firmly . " In my part of the country we do n't law them , " Luke boasted . " We ai nt in your part of the country , " Fort pointed out . " Got the rent up ? " " It 's three-thirty a week for the set of us , " Luke explained as if the question had been asked of Dove . " That comes to one-ten a week , " Fort broke the figure down for everybody present . " Agreeable to me , " Dove accepted the alcove and went to try out his cot . " I do n't suppose you fellows got a yaller yam to spare ? " " Nary a yam , son . " " Wall , I just had a hankerin ' . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rent , but listened only absent-mindedly . His right buttock still burned where the mosquito had gotten him . He rubbed the spot while waggling his tooth , till sleep stopped waggle , rub and hankerin ' .  |p134Fort  looked like an ice-house horse mistakenly entered in a claiming race , then insulted publicly for not winning . All his life he had been lapped by competition too fast for an ice horse . All his life he had been outclassed . Therefore no failure had been his own . How could a man who had never had a proper start be blamed for anything ? Worse , nobody would listen to Fort 's side of the story . How all the good times had passed Fort by , the love and the high living . " Watch out for yourselves after this , " he warned all men , " I 'm takin ' care of Number One . " Yet moments of melancholy touched him when he realized that , somewhere , some deserving girl with a steady job was being deprived of him every day . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to find him . But the columnshad turned out to be taken up mostly by spongers advertising for somebody to support them . What was the use of a world that failed to reward the deservingwhile heaping all manner of goodies on people who ought simply be given a kick in the teeth and sent flying ? Someone just had n't been paying attention was how things looked to Fort . He had ruined himself over and over for the sake of others and not one yet had said , " Thank you , goodbuddy . " Forty years of selfless devotion to humanity had brought him no more than the faded cotton on his back . Actually , those thin and rubbery lips had begun taking care of Number One with the first rug of his pinewood mother 's teat . And had lactated every available nipple since . " That was a real smart woman , " Dove heard him talking in his sleep  --  " she gave me twenty dollars . " That was how Fort had gone about making others happy . That was why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flapped he could feel himself so terribly wronged . And could bear his cross so mournfully , a sort of Kiwanisp135Christ in a Bing Crosby shirt , resigned to insult and injury , without a shred of larceny and incapable of imposing his woes on others . In fact , he told Dove so : " I 'm not the kind to burden others with my troubles . Nobody will know from these sufferin ' lips through what Old Fort have went . " Then play by play revealed through just what Old Fort had went . However self-deluded , he was n't much deluded about New Orleans . " It 's just scratchin ' a pore man 's ass to try to make a living in this town , " he informed Dove right off . " This town 'll starve you to death . I 'm a mechanic , a cook , I can drive a truck or cab , I play the gee-tar and I can keep books for anybody . I made twenty cents yesterday and a nickel the day before and that 's doing better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar a day like Hoover tells him he got to  --  but where 's he to get the dollar ? " " It 's a hard git-by , " Little Luke cut in , " but what have a man got to lose by leading a Christian life ? What if he do n't get rich but just poor-hogs it all his days ? He still got a high place in the Kingdom cornin ' , ai nt he ? Rich or poor do n't matter  --  Heaven apportion its awards accordin ' each man to his merit as I look at it . " " I guess everyone get exactly what he got comin ' , " Dove agreed , " but I ai nt old enough to vote myself and do n't think I will till I am . " Fort had come out of the ' gator backl.ands to Coral Gables just as the beaches were being prepared for the boomer and the shark . Boomers and shark already lolled the palmetto sands . " Makin ' any money ? " they asked instead of " good morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southernboy , but every face he saw wore the same obscene " N.Y . " " Makin ' any money ? " He had stood bent and sweating over oven and stove , plyingthe frycook 's fearsome trade , while New Yorkers gotp136suntanned with girls half their ages a hundred yards away . Soiled and baked by grease and sweat , still bent but beyond sweating , when waiters swung through the kitchen door , he glimpsed boomer and shark once more . Now they had changed to evening clothes and their girls to sleeveless satin . On the damask white as snow , dark wine or light looked equally cool . One night an order had come back  --  " Not done enough , " and had then been returned once again  --  " now it 's too well done . " He had heard the metallic ring of laughter right out of downtown Gomorrah . Between the dark wine and the light on damask white as snow . Fort had that pinewood prurience that made him feel that going half-naked into the sea , even in the summer night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he went wading into the midnight waters he wore long winter underwear . He felt safer , somehow , that way . Fort was afraid of all open waters . He only went in far enough to let it spill through his palms and was careful not to splash . I ligh overhead the bright windowspaid for in Yonkers and the Bronx were filed one above the other . Oh , he knew what they were up to behind the shades all right. 0 you smiling , treacherous girls , blouses unbuttoned and skirts unzipped , lolling up there in your bed lamps ' joy , saying " Maxie , play with me just right , " while some king of the garment trade undressed her garment by garment . Hotel Sodom  --  that was what it ought to be called . To think of Christian girls , good Southern girls , daughters of families who remembered Shiloh and Atlanta naked up there in the arms of hairy brown thieves from Babylon . The giraffe-like man in the sea spilled Southern waters from palm to palm . In his heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarters he froze onep137minute and sweated the next . He saw himself wheeling a Stutz  --  it was always a Stutz . And the wind that went by lifted the skirt of the slender blonde girl beside him so high he reached his big hand out  --  " Makin ' any money ? " she taunted him , and then there was no one at all on the seat beside him . Indeed , there was no seat beside him . Only a soiled pillow too hot to touch and the morning light seeping in from the hall that led one-way to the kitchen . " Makin ' any money ? " the chef had asked as soon as Fort had tied his apron that morning . " Makin ' any money ? " was the last thing Fort had heard that night . He had learned to command the easy credit of that day and rushed , with other thousands there , to lay hand on anything of earth or steel or stone whose value would be enhanced as soon as a city would be built up about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , everyone knew the metropolis would soon rise and held stubbornly onto their pieces of earth or stone though offered fifty times their worth . Why give fortunes to strangers ? Land that had sold for two dollars an acre went for three hundred . Business lots worth two thousand came to be worth a hundred thousand . Lots remote from any business district were reckoned business lots . Farmlandsworth fifty dollars an acre became " subdivisions " and were held for ten thousand per acre  --  " in a couple years this will be downtown . " On the morning he made his first timid hundred dollar killing , Fort left the chops for other cooks to fry . Five hundred , eight-hundred  --  twelve-hundred dollars ! He had never in his life been worth so much . He developed cunning . Four thousand , eight thousand  --  the wind was behind him now but he was afraid to move out of his small furnished room for fear of breaking the magic . Twelve-thousand  --  fifteen-thousand  --  at eighteen he thought of actually buying a Stutz . When he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bottom had to fall out , he sensed . He would n't be caught trying to make a million . He made his limit in a single operation  --  then realized that stopping now would only be to throw away another twentyfivegrand . At fifty he would surely stick . Every day he thought of that Stutz . At forty-two thousand he bought himself the loudest swimmingtrunks in Coral Gables and showed himself in the sun at last , feeling suddenly half kindly toward other dollar daddies . Why hold it against a man because he was born in New York ? A New Yorker could be a good American too . He spent three days haggling over the price of a Model-T that he drove proudly back to his furnished room at last , and proudly mounted the hot dim stair for the final time . On the table a letter reported that his forty-two thousand was unnegotiabledust . The sleeping till noon and the sherry , the port and the Stutz and the linen , all had been in his hands and all had slipped through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would never once sleep past seven . Fort walked through the curious ruins of a future that never would be , through old never-was cities . The great **26;9878;TOOLONG fallen to decay before anybody had laid a brick . The grand hotels , the gleaming lobbies , the fountainedparks , where now there was nothing but grass and cindersalong the Southern Railway 's right of way . Walked the little midnight towns , remembering the dark wine and the light ; hearing his own heels ring . Thinking still how it might have been to walk at morning in a garden of his own . And find her lying on her side in a striped hammock , in a dress so sheer the softest breeze rippled it and half-pretending sleep . He would rock her gently , there would be no need ofp139words . Only her waking smile and her drowsy hands lazily slipping the buttons of her blouse to please him . At midnight in the never-was towns hearing his own heels ring . Or in the steaming New Orleans night , heard laughter faint yet still undying  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of downtown Gomorrah . Then block after block the big freckled man , so stooped , spavined and drooping , wandered the lovely New Orleans night till he found an ice-cart . Then would sniff the ice in the cart 's single flickering flare , holding two pennies tightly as a child , this financial counsellor nearly six and a half feet high . Was the chocolate syrup really fresh ? No syrup but chocolate could assuage his self-pity . Had it been made that very morning ? At last he would venture one slow suspicious lick before finally letting his pennies go . He just was n't taking chances any more . One warm night Dove went along to help him find an icecartwith proper chocolate , and that night the first lick convincedhim . He turned and beamed down on Dove  --  " Lend me two more cents , goodbuddy "  --  and held out the ice to the vendor  --  " Make her a double , goodbuddy ! " That night the chocolate must have been just right . Though himself without manners enough to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions . Above a cup of chicory coffee he would study Dove so steadily that the boy would begin to wonder what he could have done wrong so soon in the day with the sun scarcely up over Melpomene Street . " Your whole family eat with their hats on ? " Fort finally asked . Dove set his straw skimmer to one side of his plate . " Never heard of hat racks , " Fort commented bitterly to the bitter window . " Your whole family drink out of the saucer ? " he asked  | " I like coffee poured out in the sasser , " Dove explained firmly . " Would you kindly pass me the toastes bread ? I like it better with a touch of long-sweetenin ' , but since there ai nt no long-sweetenin ' I 'll just give it a touch of the coffee in my sasser . " Fort lived in a welter of unwashed socks , cigarette butts , icesticks , Bull Durham and strewn want-ads . What he was through with he tossed on the floor and never washed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too light , " he accused the human race in general and Dove Linkhorn in particular . " So dern hongry if I went out in the sun I 'd be prostated like a dog . " " There 's a loaf of store bread on the fireboard , Fort , " Dove told him . " I 'd as soon let the moon shine in my mouth as to eat light bread , " Fort spurned the baker 's common loaf . " Well , " Dove thought it all over a minute , " light bread 's better than nothin ' . I 've tried both . " But Fort , moved by the vision of himself prostrated like a dog with people stepping over him , rose and announced , " Turnin ' over a new leaf  --  takin ' care of Number One ! " And left in a rush to start taking care of Number One . " I do believe hard times is crazyin ' him , " Dove told Little Luke later . If Fort cast gloom wherever he went , Little Luke was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go-getter with a little pug face like a rouged pekinese and a breath to cripple a kitten . " I 'm unfinancial for the moment , " he never blamed anyonebut himself for being broke  --  " I was selling holy stones for luck and like a fool I sold them all . Did n't keep a single one for myself . Carelessness , carelessness . " " I do n't believe in nothing like that , " Dove told him , " and would n't buy one from a stranger if I did . " Luke always had a commission coming in , a percentage going out and an urgent transaction in the offing.  |p141The  offing was in a shambling gin mill called Dockery 's Dollhouse , down in the district where all his strange business was done . Others said gin was a weakness with him , but Luke had a different name for it . He called it wanderlust . Wherever he went some Miss Jane or Miss Molly pled with him to settle down with her on some fine old Southern estate . Luke would put her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lusts by night , until she 'd surprise him preparing his blanket roll  --  they all went hystericalon him then . If he left her now she 'd kill herself . Things had gotten so bad he 'd taken to sneaking off in the middle of the night . " That part I can readily believe , " Fort would comment . " Met Miss Molly at a Memphis candy-breakin ' ' n she treated me like I was somethin ' on a stick . Had this fine old home in Greenville and a restaurant chain  --  oh the sweet potatopie that woman put out ! "  --  Luke went lying blithely on  --  " the sentimental little fool . When she seen I had my mind set on leaving she give me five-dollar meal ticket good in either Memphis or Atlanta . " " Was that before or after she killed herself ? " Fort inquired mildly . " I 'm plenty worried about her , " Luke implied darkly . And went on the nod right where he sat , his Bottled-in-theBarnjust within reach . " Watch out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment Luke began to snore . " He 'll talk a country boy like you into some fool operation and you 'll be the one to take the rap , mark my word . Watch out , goodbuddy . " Goodbuddy promised he 'd watch out . As soon as Fort slept Luke opened one glimmering eye . " Ssssss  --  Tex , " he whispered to Dove  --  " Watch out for that piss-complected faker . He 's been in every clink between Miami and Houston . He hollered on me so he 'll holler on you . Watch out , Tex . "  |p142Tex  promised to watch out . " That 's what I call a couple considerate fellows , " Dove realized , " watchin ' out for my interests in shifts . " One night Luke came banging and jangling in , trailing odors of seafood and gin . " Srimps ! He'p yorse'ves , boys ! " He bounced a greasy bag on the table , put another nameless bottlebeside it , fished two Spanish onions out of his pocket and invited everyone in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grieved , filling his face , " taste a mite swivelly . " " The scripters says it 's a sin to eat anything that parts the hoof or do n't chew cood but I like crimps all the same , " Dove reported . Luke began stacking quarters and halves ostentatiously . Somebody had gotten rich fairly fast . " I 'm jest eatin ' them because I need sustenance so bad , " Fort explained , his voice round with self-pity  --  " two orangey ice-sticks just ai nt enough to sustain a man till evening . " " Take this for tomorrow 's sustenance then , " Luke sent a quarter to him with a small disdainful finger-flick . Dove tightenedlest Fort return the insult with his fist . " They do n't know how to make hot sauce in this town , " Fort observed , pocketing the quarter as if he 'd just earned it . Orange ice stuck to his chin . I lot sauce colored his chops . Hairs stuck out of his nose and snot hung hard to the hairs . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another quarterready to roll . " Thank you kindly all the same , " Dove declined . " I did n't think so , " Luke concluded without looking at Fort . A shrimp 's tail had lodged between Fort 's teeth and he washaving the devil 's own time prying the tip of it with histongue . " Mighty funny they do n't clean these things before selling them to folks , " he protested as if he 'd paid double for something . Dislodging the tail at last , he spat it on the floor.  | " I would eat one of them ing-urns , " Dove announced . Luke looked confused . " He means one of them  --  " Fort indicated an onion . It was true enough that two orangey ices was n't enough to sustain a man like Fort till evening . It was n't enough to sustain Dove either . Yet each evening he announced , " I got to get a soon start in the morning . Will one of you fellers holler me up ? " And lugged a sample-case into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Store at Your Door . " Past the Confederate Veterans ' Home . A Store at Your Door down Humanity Street and up Gentilly Road . Rapping the front door or rapping the back down Peoples Avenue . Peoples to Almonaster , front doors and rear . As the forenoonheat began to heap both sides of Spain Street down to the wharves . By noon , with his case lighter only by sale of one jar of hair-straightener , he 'd be sitting on the Desire Street dock admiringa ship from Norway or Peru with a big nick4el bunch of bananas beside him and one little dry Spanish ing-urn . Dreaming and peeling , Dove would recall all the storied shores he had almost seen . Through half-closed lids his thoughts rocked down , down the great river to the almostsea . The masted and magic almost-sea . Rocking so far out on the dangerous waves it was really too far , and so would rock himself gently back to shore : the sheltering home-harbor shore . Where friendly street lamps lit the way to some old chili parlor door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost townWhen you 're on some distant shoreThink on your absent friendAnd when the wind blows high and clear A letter too pray send  --  to Dove 's own homesick shore.  |p144He  would blink the bright tears from his eyes at last . No time to be homesick any more . Scarcely time left for a man to rise . He would pick up his sample case and lug on , rapping a front door or rapping a rear . It could n't be too long now beforesome little good looker would invite him too into a fine old Southern home , serve him sweet potato pie too and say , " Big Fine Daddy , please stop runnin ' wild . " But he only came to a great lonely house where a wan redheadof twelve or thirteen cried out at sight of his little store  --  " Granny ! A man with everything we need ! " She seized a bar of tar soap " for my nappy old hair . " A shoehorn for her nappy old shoes and cologne for her nappy old bath ; a nail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's things you need here too , Granny ! " It looked to Dove like the sale of the year . Till an old , old woman 's voice recalled the girl , and she returnedlooking more wan than before . And , kneeling silently , replaced every item she had taken from the case . " It 's awright , Miss , " Dove reassured her , " Lots of ladies pick out things ' n then change their minds , times bein ' hard as they are . " " I did n't intend to disappoint you , " the child told him quietly . A nickel spun into the case , the screen door slammed , that old , old house stood sick and still . " You would of done better to take the soap , " Dove reproachedthe empty porch and shut his case . But pocketed the nickel . It would buy a cup of Southern coffee and a paper for Fort to read out loud to him . He walked the endless Negro blocks to home because it was still day . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were they forever laughing about from doorstep to door that he could never clearly hear ? Their voices dropped when he came near and did n't rise till he was past earshot . Yet their prophecies pursued him  --   |p145De  Lord Give Noah de rainbow sign  --  Wont be by water but by fire next timeFort was lying on the high brass bed when Dove climbed the Tchoupitoulas Street stair that evening , just as Dove had left him that morning . A couple of noon cups had been added to the morning saucers , a few snipes to those on the floor . " Have n't been able to stir the whole day , " Fort sighed . Yet Dove had the momentary impression he had just come in . Dove handed him the paper and cleared the table and sink while Fort read aloud . Fort crumpled the want-ads . What was the use of getting out a paper that did n't tell who needed a Financial Coun-sellor ? The Financial Counsellor did n't get up till the dishes were done . " I s'pose I got to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " he informed Dove by his tone just whatit was like to be imposed upon by everyone day after day . " Wo n't we wait till Luke shows up ? " Dove suggested , " accountall I got myself is one misty little two-bitses . " " He 'll come in drunk as a dog but he wo n't have his rent money up , " Fort made a safe guess . " That 's his turn , an ' he caint help it , " Dove defended his friend . Fort began frying something and after a while it must have been done , because he lifted two shapeless gobs into dishes and put both dishes down . " I 'll eat anything that wo n't eat me , " Dove announced , and dug right in , cupping his spoon in the palm of his hand before he even made sure the stuff was dead . Fort gave him the even look . " You actually like this slop ? "  | " You mean if I had my druthers ? Why , if I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dove assured him . " You do n't actually mind living this way ? " " It 's better than jail . " Dove was sure . " That 's jest what I thought , " Fort 's suspicions were confirmed  --  " Youactually like this life . " " It 's the only life I got , " Dove felt bound to explain . Little Luke came in grinning with good news on his face and another newspaper under his arm . " We 've just done turned that corner , " he announced . " Did n't 1. , tell you times had to get worse before they could get better ? " " Luke , " Fort rose to tell him , " if we were standin ' around wonderin ' which one of us to eat first you still would n't call times hard . " Then he left to look for something to eat . Luke skipped to his coat and brought forth a stack of green-margined certificates " entitling bearer to one free fingerwave and shampoo at the Madam Dewberry Beauty Shop "  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what woman in N'awlins do n't want a marcel wave and shampoo for free ? " Dove could n't name a single one . " Tell you what it amounts to , Tex  --  you 're handing that lucky gal the equivalent of a five-dollar bill . " " I am ? " " You 're workin ' with inc on this , are n't you ? " " Would it be alright with Madam Dewberry ? " " That 's my responsibility . " " Mighty obliged , Luke . " " All you have to do is watch out for telephone wires . " " flint no plumb good at climbin ' , Luke . " " Who said there was climbin ' ? " Somebody 's step sounded on the stair and Luke ducked the certificates hastily into his coat . " Got a hundred more stashed under the steps , " he lowered his voice and touched a finger to his lips  --  " Mum 's the word . "  |p147Ra|p|ping  with Luke was a lark . Instead of a heavy sample case all Dove had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have to climb a telephone pole after all . " I 'll have to wait to see what my husband says , " his first prospect told him . " Reckon you 'll just miss your free wave ' n shampoo then , m'am . We ai nt comin ' by this way again . Fact is we 're almost out of certificates already . Only puttin ' out a hundred in the whole dern town . " The woman studied the certificates with a married daughterbeside her . " Seems just too good to be true , " both frankly doubted him . " M'am , why do n't you just telephone Madam Dewberry and veerfy what I 'm sayin ' ? " Inasmuch as there was seldom more than one telephone to a block in New Orleans in ' 31 , the bluff was safe . She took one for herself and one for the daughter . His second prospect had a harder head . " You wait here , young man  --  I am going to phone . " " Yes 'm . " Dove obeyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to the corner grocer 's phone , Dove scurried to warn Luke off the block . Luke took a swig from a half pint off his hip and did n't feel the need to hurry anywhere . " Take your time , Tex . " " Here she comes now . " Luke intercepted the hardheaded number . " Good morning , m'am . I 'm the manager of the Madam Dewberry Beauty Parlor . My young assistant here reports you want to confirm this invitation . We like that . You 're the type of customer we 're looking for . If we can satisfy you , we can satisfy anybody . Do n't waste your nickel  --  I stand back of every word on this certificate . " Luke drew one out of his pocket . " I 'm not going to charge you even a quarter for this one , m'am. "  |p148He  put it in her hand . " I did n't mean I wanted it for nothing , " Hardhead protested . " If you want to pay the young man the courtesy fee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman handed Dove a quarter and returned to the house reading the smaller print . The rest of the morning went easier . By noon twenty-five quarters jingled in Dove 's jeans and he still had twenty-five certificates for the evening . But by evening Luke had invested his own quarters in a bottle of gin , so that before they had rapped many doors they were in no shape to rap at all . Toward midnight Dove heard horns and bells . They were helping one another down Tchoupitoulasand the whole dark city rang . On their old stairs ' steep sad height Dove held Luke back . " I wonder did old Fort eat today ? " " Let the sonofabitch starve , " Luke pushed into the room . On the bed Fort lay with his face to the wall . " Shhhh , " Dove cautioned Luke , " do n't wake him up . " " The sonofabitch been awake for hours , " Luke decided , and shook Fort by the shoulders . " I Icy ! Good old buddy ! Srimps ! Fresh srimps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . He did n't see shrimps . He did n't smell shrimps . " Because there ai nt no srimps because we et ' em all , goodbuddy , " Luke laughed with real glee and did a little taunting song and danceYou made a lot of money back in ' 22But whiskey and women made a fool of you Why do n't you do rightGet me some money tooDove remembered his own pockets and withdrew six cold shrimps wrapped in a paper napkin.  | " Here , Fort , " and held them out over the sleeper 's face to show it was n't a joke after all . " As good-tasted a srimp as ever you et  --  " Fort swung a hand and sent shrimps and napkin flying . One ricocheted off the wall onto the bed . Dove picked it up and nibbled drunkenly at it , looking down at six and a half feet of self-pity huddled under a dirty patch quilt . Hours later he was wakened by someone padding about . Luke was snoring in the chair . Dove saw a match 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope he finds them all , " Dove thought and returned to sleep . In the morning Fort had left . " I think he 's a mite fitified with us , " Dove felt . " We hurt his feelings last night . " " His type feelings is hurt till they smell cookin ' , " Luke was certain . " Then they come runnin ' . " " I would n't fault him , " Dove excused Fort . " He 's just a poor hippoed critter . " " Hippoed ? " " He 's liver-growed . His liver has growed to one side , that 's plain to be seen . If he 'd been held upside down when he was a young ' n ' n shook good , it could have been shuk loose . Too late now . Be there ary egg about ? " " How do you want it ? Up or over ? " " I 'm not dauncy , " Dove answered , " I like an egg everwhatway . " When both eggs were everwhatted , Luke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . They left the pan and the dishes for Fort to clean and made their morning run with twenty-five certificates each from Luke 's secret cache . Upon their evening return dishes littered the table , flies fed in all the pans and an odor of meat burnt or burning hung like a promise of better times : Fort was stretched more than the length of the high brass bed , smoking a cigar looking as longp150as himself ; like a man who had never missed a meal . It was an unsettling sight . " Spared half a steak for you boys , " he recalled , blowing mosquitoes off in a T-bone shaped cloud  --  " but you did n't show up so I said to myself , You better knock that steak off before the flies get it . ' Had to force myself , but I did . Sure would have admired to share it but it 's no use kicking myself for not waiting now . " Sure enough . A steak 's remains had been fried right there on their own stove , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , he laughed at them both in sleep . He never laughed except in sleep but Dove and Luke took their laughter waking . In the days that followed they stayed drunk , off and on , most of the summer day and often well into the summer night . They had no reason for not being drunk . The days of peeking timidly into a backyard to check on telephone wires were past . A businessman like himself , Dove had come to feel , had n't time to bother with that sort of thing . He rapped fast and hard at front doors these days , and once when a housewife answered he challenged her before she had a chance to ask what he wanted --  " Go ahead ' n call up ! See who cares ! "  --  and with a tip ) f his straw floater was gone in an evening mystery , down a gently weaving street . For some reason sales began falling off . Would times get better before they ran out of certificates ? Luke was sure things were on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would have certificates left they would have no use for . But Fort felt the depression had just begun . Things were going to get a lot worse he foretold , and would stay that way longer than anyone believed . Then the bottom would fall out . Nonetheless , whenever they returned , shrimpless or shrimpified , the odor of sirloin , hamburger or chops made the air of the little room muggy , and Fort would be blowing off thep151odor with clouds of Cuban cigar smoke . Somebody was doing all right . " If you boys would only let me know whether I could expect you , I 'd be only too pleased to put your name in the pot , " he would complain . " Had steak again . " " I 'm not peckish , I 'll eat anything , even steak , " Dove provided for any such future event  --  " put my name in your pot anytime , Fort . " But the only name in Fort 's pot was spelled F-O-R-T . To show his gratitude for the night before , Dove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the dim familiar place they had to make way for a beggar in dark glasses , poking his way through seafood odors with the help of a white cane . " Excuse me , girls , " Dove heard him murmur as he passed , " excuse me . " The turtles had been given a twenty-four hour reprieve . No beheading being done today . So they ordered bowls of gumbo and gumboed bowl after bowl . Then it was catfish time and they catfished till they foundered . By the time they left the heat in the street had passed and the catfish sun itself had foundered . " I 've just about et myself into the creek , " Dove decided . He felt so full of fish and gumbo he did n't even mind when a collie in a well-kept yard charged him the full length of her chain . A white woman , holding the brute by its collar apologized , " I never knowed Queenie to go after a white man before . " Then she took a long second look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She never been wrong afore , mister . " Dove merely tipped his skimmer . " Thank you kindly all the same , m'am , "  --  and slunk off  --  " Durned old hound smelled the catfish in me . " Out where yards were n't kept so well and walks were cracked like those of home , he always felt less guilty . The lastp152door he rapped that day was on such a walk . A Negro woman with violet eyes came to the door . Dove tipped his hat , felt his heel nipped gently , and turned just in time to see a fat white mongrel whip about and dash for cover under the house as if it had done something wonderfully daring . " He do n't care for white folks comin ' into his yard , " Violet Eyes smiled matter-of-factly . " He say he ca n't go into theirs , why they come into his ? " " Thank you kindly all the same , " Dove told her , thinking guiltily again , " Durned old hound smelled the certificates on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' n rappin ' ' n tappin ' is too much like work for me , " Luke decided , and Dove had had enough too . Though it was n't walkin ' ' n talkin ' Dove minded . Nor even rappin ' ' n tappin ' . It was rather that each quarter he stole weighed a bit more than the one stolen just before . The sample case was lighter after all . " How many them phonies you got left , Tex ? " Dove handed Luke the last of the batch . Luke took a count . Thirteen . " I know a place where we can get shet of these in one stop , " he promised . On South Rampart Dove waited out front while Luke ducked around the rear of a Negro shanty and returned with a pint of Bottled-in-the-Barn . They drank it down to the half-pint mark . " That stuff is so good a feller ca n't hardly bite it off , " Dove told Luke . " It 's the pure quill , " Luke agreed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corn . " Dove took another just to see if Luke were right about that . " It sure ai nt gravy , " he reported . " Care to see the girls , boys ? " a little man in a flame-yellow shirt and cowboy boots asked from a doorway so wide it must once have been an entrance to a pretentious bar . " They givin ' it away today ? " Luke asked innocently.  |p153The  little blond man had sideburns past his cheekbones , he might have been twenty-two or forty . " To a couple good-looking fellows like you I would n't be surprised if they did , " he conned Luke right back . " Reason I suggested that , " Luke explained , " is that we 're giving things away . " He drew forth a green-margined certificate . " Free finger waves at Madame Dewberry 's . Reckon the little ladies might be interested ? " " Why , this is the very deal they 've been wondering how they can get it , " the little man pretended , " they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the time the two pitchmen realized they 'd been outpitchedthey were inside one of those high old-fashioned parlorswhere a ceiling fan whirrs so leisurely in a big twilit gloom that you ca n't tell whether anyone else is in the room . Gradually the forms of half a dozen men sitting as men sit in a barber shop , collars open and Sunday 's funnies on their laps , one or two with cigars in hand , emerged from the dimness . Something brushed Dove 's hair and he touched a spider made of metal , suspended upon so slender a wire it was not discernible until a wave from the ceiling fan swung it ; then a burnished glint wound right , wound left in the soundlessly woven air . The woven air so softly spun by spiders red , by spiders green , some low-hung and some high ; some gold and others rose . Spinning webs so fine on thread unseen in a long twilit gloom . Dove picked up one magazine , pretending to read as other men did . Till suddenly wishing somehow to outdo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he picked it up boldly and returned to his chair . He flipped its pages carelessly , as though the light were too poor for a man to strain his eyes . He had flipped almost through , then gave one more flip , and his hand trembled on the page.  |p154For  there his steadfast tin soldier stood , his musket clasped under his grenadier 's hat , and behind him waited the same platoon of two-legged soldiers . The one-legged one was still the most steadfast . In his simple-minded amazement he thought it must be Terasina 's book . " The girls will be down directly , boys , " a bespectacled mulatto woman wearing black crepe chiffon , in which she had pinned velvet flowers , came bouncing to announce . " Ask them do they want free marcels , Lucille , " Luke asked her . " It 's been many years since anyone called me Lucille ' , " she told Luke . " Many years , " Luke agreed wistfully , " many , many years . " She peered at him but the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come like waves of the sea one fast upon another . Now there was no longer any recalling what shore , what summer nor what night hour their eyes had met in love or lust or simple bargaining . " They call me Mama now , " she explained , " I 'm just the housekeeper here . " Then she caught sight of Dove clutching the parlor 's one book . " That 's our 1lallie 's , " she told him . Dove looked at the name scribbled in the front . So that was how to write " Ilallic 's . " And kept his finger on that name though he closed the book . An old man in a high-backed chair hoping to make the price of a pint , and the boy beside him longing for love so hard that a name in a book was already beloved . While others waited like window-dummies , anonymous men waiting to stay anonymous . They sighed , they spat , they snored now and then , but were careful not to begin idle talk that might lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shirt that reached no farther than hisp155navel studied each client in turn . Some smiled , some looked the other way . He would look till he had his fill of each , then move onto the next . If offered a penny he would pocket it yet never crack a smile . A feminine scent , as of incense mixed with cologne , stirred the portieres . Dove gripped the book tighter . This would be Hallie . But it was only the fan overhead that had stirred the curtain . Now the metal spiders hung more still , now the barber shop boredom grew yet heavier . Across the street a man in a black stetson was offering a bag of something to a girl in the corner door . Dove saw her look both ways down Rampart and look both ways down Perdido . Then reached swiftly into the bag and dodged as swiftly back . A moment later she reopenedthe door just long enough to spit a peanut shell into the street . Any transaction , even for peanuts , made with one party still on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the risk she 'd taken paid off , for the stetson girded up his loins and entered clutching his bag big enough to provide a peanut for every girl in the place and still leave two for himself . The first street lamp came on , looked both ways down Rampart then both ways down old Perdido ; then steadied itselffor the long night ahead . When God alone knew what peanutless monster , what penniless stray , might come there seeking rest . A moon-faced blonde with her hair in a bun sauntered in , her face dead-white and her brows pitch-black . Dove gave a start , then relaxed : no , this one never could be Hallie . " Reba , these boys got marcel waves to give away , " Mama told her . " You got insurance ? " Reba demanded . " We got insurance to keep your hair from getting nappy , " Luke stepped right in . Reba held out her baby hand and he clapped a certificate right in it.  | " That 'll be a quarter , miss . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter is just by way of a courtesy , " Luke told her . " Keep it . I ai nt courteous , " and gave him back his gift . " She 's from Chicago , " Mama explained . But a girl with a face made up to look like a death mask of Joan Crawford , a real plastic mask of a face , began to plead for one . " Mama sweet , give the man a quarter for one for me . " " For God 's sake , she do n't even know what the guy is sellin ' ' n she 's buyin ' , " Chicago shook her head in disbelief at the ways of Southern hustlers . " Meet Frenchy , " Mama introduced the mask , " and this is my grandson , Warren Gameliel . Fledge allegiance , Warren G. " The little black boy was n't pledging a thing . He was n't even saying hello . " I do it back , " he warned everyone . No one knew what he meant by that. "  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blonde twice the size of the first , with breasts that could better have hung on a cow . No , this never could be Hallie . Mama handed Luke a quarter for Frenchy , the girl received her paper , gave it one bored glance and handed it to Fort Worth  --  " You use it , honey , I never go downtown . " She had bought like a child , for the sake of the transaction , and like a child had made a gift of it to the nearest friend . Dove saw that there was nothing easier than selling to hustlingwomen . Reba was the only one who would n't buy just for the sake of buying . Warren Gameliel seemed less a child than the women . Clutching a penny of his own , he watched each transfer of ownership so intently that Mama declared , " I swear I believe that child can add and subtract . " And added , perhaps to put the salesmen into a mood that would get the girls their quartersback , " We get lots of married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shod the horse all around as it were . Once to a businessman and three times to thieves , and the businessman was the only one I was unhappy with . " " Is Looney up yet ? " someone asked . " Which looney ? " Fort Worth wanted to know . " There 's no one in this house name of Looney ' that I know of , " Mama defended the missing chick . " If you 're referring to Floralee , she 's putting on her clothes . I forbade her ever to come down again without them . You know what she told me ? I do n't see the use of all this onnin ' - 'n- offin ' , '  --  that 's just what the poor thing told me . " " What 's so looney about that ? " Fort Worth wanted to know . " After last night I do n't see how that broad can get downstairswith or without clothes , " Frenchy marveled from behindJoan Crawford 's eyebrows , " I do n't even see how she can rise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and eat grits and ham enough for six , too , you 'll see if she do n't , " Fort Worth promised . " She do n't even know she got a stomach , that one . " " Any broad that 'll make love back to her tricks , " Reba reflectedsadly , "  --  no wonder she got a appetite . " " Do n't begrudge the child her food , " Mama reproved them all , " she got her ways and you got yours . " " If that pimp of hers had a saltspoon of sense in his head , " Frenchy decided , " he 'd wise her up . What 's a pimp for ? " " You tell me , " Fort Worth put Frenchy down fast , " you work for one . " The door was swung wide and a legless giant , buckled onto a sort of street-going raft built over roller skates , wheeled in like one who came here every day , making a hollow thunder across the planking as he came . Dove watched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , onto a low divan . The little black boy came up to this enormous torso withoutfear , to study him comparatively . The great cripple gavep158him a coin , but the boy remained unsmiling before him . Suddenlyhe asked , " What they done to you ? " " Such a serious child , " Mama marveled . " Will you boys stay to party ? " " We got a little work to finish , " Luke decided to save them both money , " We 'll be back later . " As they left , the man no higher than five feet in cowboy boots opened the door for them . " Come back by yourself , " Dove was almost sure he heard the little man whisper ; yet it had been said so low that they were a full block away before the whisper began to draw him back . " Sure would of admired to tarry there , " he sighed heavily , " a little ying-yang never hurt a man . " " Terrible waste of hard-earned money , son , " Luke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , I deem , " Dove corrected him like a friend . " Too much of that thing and they 'll be carrying you away , boy . " " Nothin ' wrong with that , " Dove reflected , " inasmuch as it was that thing that brought me here . I 'll tell you just what , Luke , " he stopped right where he stood : " I 'm just urnin ' for ying-yang . " " See you back home , boy , " Luke dismissed him . " Just do n't bring anything home with you . " Dove hurried back up the street , afraid the little man might have left . It did n't seem to him that he could regain entrance without being authorized by a friend . " My name is Finnerty , " he told Dove , " follow me . " And led Dove downhill toward the docks . Halfway downhillhe turned into a tiled doorway that still Jield rusted hinges of a time when the place had had swinging doors . A one-story building built on its incline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , habits it hadp159formed in those who had had their living off it for years could not be changed overnight . Every self-respecting speakeasydevised its own secret knock , peep-hole and password . Buyers wanted more than to walk through an open door , they wished to be admitted to a mystery . More , they wished to belong to a mystery . After Finnerty had given the buzzer three quick shots , he waited a moment and added a fourth ; then both stood in silencebefore a silent door . " Maybe ai nt nobody home , " Dove ventured . " He 's squirrel-eyeing us this minute from behind the curtain , " Finnerty confided without glancing at the window , " to see if we 're the type that demands service . If we buzz him again , we do n't get in . Doc just wo n't be bossed . " At last the door opened enough to let a white bug of a nose materialize before them . " Password ? " the nose demanded . " Respect is the key , " Finnerty replied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too and both were inside . Where along the back bar 's thousand bottles , Old Doc Dockery 's hundred dolls remembered the twisted twenties . Dark-eyed , dressy little town dolls and dutch-bobbed blondies from windmilled countrysides , redhaired colleens and gypsy dolls , a cowgirl cutie in a fringed buckskin and a Broadway baby in a fur boa , a geisha whose eyes were quarter-moonsand another who had bobbed her hair and gone all out in Babylon ; for her eyes were dollar-signs . A penny-eyed doll and a button-eyed doll whose buttons said " Vote for Cox " ; a cross-eyed doll no longer comical , and a doll wearing a bird of paradise . And one little down-andoutbum of a Raggedy Ann with patches on her skirt and wrinkles in her neck ; right in the middle where the bar lights could make a small halo about her . Yet birds of paradise or Raggedy Anns , though one pretended to be Dutch , one Irish and one Japanese , all had seen the headlines on St. Valentine 's Day and had dated Harryp160Greb . Some had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all had been born to the twenties and had died when the twentieswere done . Some of broken hearts when Wallace Reid had died . Some had gone on the nod waiting for Dempsey to fight Harry Wills . Others had grown weary after Starr Faithful had passed . One by one they had nodded off , taking their good luck and taking their bad . ( Raggedy Ann 's , of course , had been worse than the others , that was plain enough by her patches . And perhaps was the reason she had the place of honor right in the mid-dle . ) " There 's no price on them , " Dockery warned everyone , " They 're not for sale and neither am I. Respect gets you in here and disrespect gets you out . Respect , respect is the key . " No one was allowed to dicker for his dolls , , no hand but his own could touch them . Respect for the dead of a dead decade  --  that was the key . The old man preferred the kind of drinker who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As some men wish to be always drunken , as some women wish to be always in love , Doc Dockery wished to be always clean . To be clean and cleaning . People , of course , could not be made clean . What kind of filth the old man had waded in neck-deep , of which he still fought to free himself in his lonely white-haired age , or what deep disease was concealed by this passion for hygiene was not clear . Yet it was plain that it had at last turned all his women to dolls . Respect , that was the key . Respect for his women , and for his music too . His music that was Stardust , StormyWeather , Bye Bye Blackbird , A Good Man Is Hard To Find , My Bill , Paper Doll , Red Sails in the Sunset and Tie Me To Your Apron Strings Again . To this lopsided shambles owned by this unlicensed ghost ,  |p161this  speakeasy spook who had been alive once but had died in the crash and was now only haunting the thirties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who could not admit that the money was spent , the dream was over ; the magic done . They still wore the clothes they wore before 1929 and no one knew when they might buy clothes again . By and large they were theater people who had lost their theater : ingenues , leading men , stagehands , ticket brokers , managers of road shows , starlets and prima donnas . Albeit that , just for the time being of course , they were " hostesses , " con artists , sneak thieves , con men , procurers , cardsharps , pennymatchers ; and a few honest just plain bums . The first thing Dove saw when he entered the cave was the lion-headed amputee they had left at the brothel . By what alley-route he had beat them here only someone who lived on ball-bearings could know . Finnerty drank with his back to the half-man , indicating to Dove that was the wisest way . So Dove felt somehow relievedwhen he heard the skated platform wheel down the floor , out the door and onto the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin , he put a nickel in the juke to help them begin . I 'm forever blowing bubblesthe machine beganPretty bubbles in the air " Now I 'll come to the point , " Finnerty informed Dove when the bubbles all were blown , " I need the help of a healthy boy . I take it your health is as good as it appears . " " A might better , mister , " Dove made a conservative guess , " and I 'm always ready to make an honest dollar . " " You can call me Oliver , for that 's my name . " " You can call me Tex . For that 's where I 'm from . " " My line of work , as you may have guessed , Tex , is women . Do you know anything about them ? "  | " I know that if God made anything better I ai nt come across it yet , but that 's as far as my knowledge goes . " " In that case it do n't go far , " Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in going to bed with a young woman who has never been to bed with a man before . " " Mister , I 'm a Southern boy and would n't disadvantage no young girl that way . " " Southern do n't enter into this , Tex , " Finnerty assured him , " The young woman is bound and determined to hustle . It 's all settled but the bother and inconvenience of breaking her in . " Your field being women , " Dove pointed out , " I reckon that 's your job , mister . " " Why , that 's precisely the reason I ca n't , do n't you see ? " Finnerty tried patience . " If I did it she could come back a year from now and law me on the white save act , for I 've a record in that line I do n't mind admitting . I 've already been busted on that charge once , and I do n't cherish being busted again . But someone like yourself that she 'll never see again  --  Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , , for you chant . You wo n't even have to undress this child . " " That do n't sound like no virgin girl to me , " Dove told the pander . " That 's her claim , so I take her at her word , " Finnerty told Dove . " The point is that , if you did me this one small favor , she could n't make that claim in the future . Do you follow me ? " " I follow you to a certain point , " Dove decided , " after that it 's a mite unclear . " " Maybe this will clear things up . " Dove put his hands stiffly behind his back . " Mister , I ca n't read my own name if it was writ on the side of a barn , but I know a hundred dollar bill when I see one . And I think you 'd best put that one away . " Finnerty tucked it into Dove 's breast pocket.  | " Mister , I ca n't take that , " Dove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . " Do n't worry , " Finnerty promised , " You 're not taking it , country boy . You 're carrying it for me , that 's all . You 're carrying it across the street and up the stairs to a room where this young lady is waiting for you . When you come in the room you 'll hand it to her without a word  --  if I know her greedy little heart she 'll put it in her slipper and you take it from there . " " What 's her name ? " " She 'll tell you that herself , country boy . " They were at the back entrance of the house which they 'd entered by the front before Dove hesitated . " Just one thing I 'd like to ask , mister . " " What 's that ? " Finnerty was too close behind him . " I 'd rather you call me Tex ' stead of country boy . " " Right-o , Tex , " Finnerty agreed , and shook Dove 's handto seal the deal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide . A girl with the pallor of one who lives indoors , one low of flesh but high of bone , in red shorts and red halter . Dove heard the door lock behind him . " What 's your name ? " he asked her . " Floralee , " she told him , " and I sing like a damned bird . But how did I fly here ? " " I 'm sure I do n't know , country girl , " Dove told her , " but I 'm to give you this . " He took his last ten dollar bill and handed it to her . Just as Finnerty had said , she had a greedy little heart , for she stuffed it down her slipper right away without even botheringto glance at it and snapped the button that held up her shorts . If Dove , in the minutes that followed , heard murmuredIp164laughter from behind a wall , he did n't let that divert him from the sums he had now to do in his head . " It costes me ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " at that rate I do n't see how I can lose . " On a morning so damp the salt would n't dust Dove wakenedfeeling like something chewed up and spat out . His seersucker , hung on a nail on the wall , looked like something fished out of the river . Everything his eyes fell upon looked fished-out or spat-out . He had a big bad head and held it hard , mourning " Oh , it drinked dandy but Lord the afterwards . The way the world is going I do n't think it 'll last . " But the Financial Counsellor was whistling cheerfully as he buttoned himself into a freshly pressed financial-looking suit . " Happened on a most curious certificate , " , he announced as soon as he saw Dove get one sick eye wide , and drew it forth like a document . " What do you reckon happen when one of them girls trots all the way downtown for a free marcel ? " " Reckon she gets herself fixed up right . pretty , " Dove took a hazy guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which you know very well she do n't . Did you read this thing you 're selling ? " For once Dove was glad he could n't . Fort touched a prong of his sunglasses to the fatal figures . " I warned you to stay clear of that Georgia hand , " he remindedDove , " now my advice is that you stay indoors . There must be a chance of husbands on the lookout for a country-lookin ' gin-head by now . " " I was only tryin ' to make an honest dollar in a crooked sort of way , " Dove explained . For reply Fort fastened his face one moment to the mirror and must have been pleased by what he saw . For he left with a confident , executive stride , a man who 'd be rich in six weeks if not in five.  |p165Dove  went to the window . Street to sky , New Orleans looked shrouded . He saw its fearful loneliness . He felt its dreadful heat . " It 's a misling day , " he thought , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that innocent country girl the way I done . What 's to become of her now ? " Fort was back in the doorway . " Was two blocks down afore I missed ' em , " he explained , picking up his blue sunglasses . " Sun ai nt bright , " Dove observed , " fact is it look like we might have a little weather . " Fort snapped his glasses on and left . " Weak eyes , " Dove concluded as the first drums of the rain began . Began , and paused , and began again to a slow and funerary beat . Soon one morning ' , death come creepin ' in the room Well , soon , one mornin ' , death come creepin ' in the room " I would most likely be married and well-fixed by now , keepin ' my clothes in a sweetwood chest and taking the paper in the baseball season if I could but make words out of letters , " Dove dressed himself in his daydream now wearing terribly thin , " with a girl who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids  --  I 'd learn them how to do it my own self . " Anythingcould happen to a man who could make words from letters . The smells of coffee-and-banana dock , warehouse and orange-wharfed shore were borne into the room on the wash of a rain that had no shore at all . Beneath it banana boats were moving out to sea . Trailer and truck were bringingpeanuts and grapefruit to town below it . Endless freights moved east , moved west , by plane , by boat , by passenger train . By highways dry and highways wet everyone but himself was getting to be a captain of something or other . Everyone but one forgotten Linkhorn bogged down in a room where the blues came on and the old rain rapped thisp166door then , like somebody 's grandmother seeking forever her long lost first born . And it seemed to Dove that the sun had gone down the same morning that Terasina 's arms had last locked in love behind his neck , that her good thighs in love had last drawn him down and her good mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he admitted at last , " but we only got to B. These days when I do n't get to see you are plumb squandered like the rest of all them letters . My whole endurenlife you were the only human to try to see could i live up to the alphabet . Then I would of had a chance to rise like others . " Luke came in on a skip and a grin and stood in the middle of the room drenched , drunk , hatless , the laces out of his shoes , the shirt out of his pants , the pants half-buttoned ; the picture of a contented man . " Take off your jacket , Luke , " Dove invited him , for the jacket was clinging to the skin . Luke slapped his thigh and did his little joy-jig . " It 's all in people 's minds , boy  --  business is better than ever if you only let yourself think it is . " And shook himself like a duck . " You 're soaking , " Dove pointed out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter with you , son ? Opportunity is knocking the door down and you 're beefing about a little rain . " " You looked kind of damp is all I meant . " " Son , you been alone too much , brooding here by yourself . Smile , damn you , smile . Let a smile be your umbrella , boy . " " Reckon I am a mite fevery at that , " Dove conceded . " Havin ' no breakfastes ' n thinkin ' of bygones give me the morning-wearies . " Luke brought the flat of his palm down on the table so hard he almost lost his balance . " Why did n't you say so , son ? " He began turning dirty plates over looking for something.  | " Where 's my check ? I have a small check somewhere around here . " " Must be so small it 's not to be seen with the naked eye . Fact is , the landlady came up but she did n't bring no check . She come up for to tell she wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luke stared at Dove unseeing while his brain , like a pinball machine , toted an unexpected score . His face lit triumphantly . " Chargin ' us for a place where the roof leaks so bad a man gets his bedclothes soaked in his sleep ! " He leaped on Fort 's bed , stabbed the ceiling with a jackknife and down he jumped again . Dove rushed the dishpan to the bed in time to catch the first rain drop . The second drop preened its muscles a moment in preparation for the death-defying dive , then dropped dead center with a tiny pingg . " Man would be a fool to pay rent for a room where he 's like to catch his death by dew and damp , " Luke sounded ready to sue . " Borrow me a half buck till Monday , Red ? " " Ef'n I had money I 'd buy flour ' n shortenin ' for us to have a pan of poor-do gravy , " Dove told him . " You like poor-do gravy , son ? " " Mister , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , black-eye gravy , speckledly gravy and streakedy gravy , piedy gravy , calico gravy , brindle gravy , spotted gravy , white gravy ' n grease gravy , ' n skewball gravy . I can eat lavin 's ' n lashin 's of gravy . Ef'n we had us flour ' n shortenin ' now I 'd pour a little coffee in the pan too . Yes sir , I do like gravy . " Luke slapped him cheerfully on the back . " Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag , son . Smile , darn you , smile . Laugh and the world laughs with you , Boy . Look at this  --  in six weeks we 'll both be rich ! " He was dangling some sort of purple-feathered rubber in front of Dove 's eyes . " Whatever is it , boy ? "  | " Look like a little kid 's balloon but for the feather , " Dove guessed and inspected the device more closely , " only it ca n't be no balloon because it 's hollow and could n't hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to compare , Luke . " Luke waved it like a purple flag . " It 's a contraceptive , son ! Combines protection with pleasure , " he flicked the foolishlookingfeather on its obscene tip , gave it a joyous swing and twist and flung away the certificates in his other hand . " No more knockin ' ourselves out rappin ' doors for two bits . A buck apiece boy ! One buck apiece ! " Dove shook his head mournfully . " I would n't have the common brass to knock on no lady 's door and show her one of them unnatural-lookin ' things , Luke . " Dove told him , " I 'd go plumb through the floor if she knew what it was - and if she did n't know how could I sell it ? " Luke grew serious . " Distribution is my department , Red . But there 's room for a good man in plain condom mechanics . Later you advance to fancy work . " " How much do plain condom mechanics make ? " Dove asked with only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be about four dollars a day if you just take your own time , Red . And Gross buys your meals besides . " " Who 's Gross ? " " Gross "  --  Luke would have taken off his hat in reverence had he owned a hat  --  " Gross is the father of the 0-Daddy . " " Never heard tell of that either , " Dove admitted , " but four dollar a day is mighty good pay . " Luke scribbled an address on a slip of paper , then recalled something and tore it up . " Ask a policeman , " he suggested  --  " but never mention Gross ' to anything in uniform . Get it , boy ? " " I get it , Luke . And I 'm mightily grateful . " " Let a smile be your umbrella , Son . We 're finally aroundp169that corner . Business was never better . Weep and you weep alone . " And left Dove to weep or laugh as he chose . " Always downhill and always merry , " Dove thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brainless titter of the rain . And felt as if he 'd not be hearing that foolishstep in any weather again . He never learned how the little man had come upon the address he handed Dove that day . The room began to fill with a gray-green river light , the very color of sleep . Raindrips pinged faster into the pan . Dove slept with his head in his hands . To dream of a room where buckets stood about to catch raindrops and men and women encircled a bed to watch a woman and a man . Above the girl 's head the gloom was smeared by light like a yellowing streak of shame and Dove saw she had one toenail painted green . And heard Fort 's voice toll and toll from some chapel below sleep  --  " Hasteth ! Hasteth ! " In a robe once red and now faded to rose Terasina came toward him wearing dark glasses and extending her arms to find her blind way . Then one raindrop pinged into a bucket , another and another . It saddened Dove to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend and he could not leave till the last of all fell . " Boy ! Wheah ' s mah pot ? " A big hand began shaking him . Under the light the real Fort stood looking down . " Who poked the holes in my ceiling , Son ? " Dove looked at the dishpan . Its bottom was barely covered . " Luke thought if the rain leaked in we would n't be held for the rent . " " A mighty weak thought , " Fort decided . " I got a little inkle , Fort . "  | " You got a little what ? " " I got a little inkle Luke is fixin ' to move on . " " I could n't be more unconcerned , son . Made my rent this afternoon . Picked up six dollar in the rain ' n could of made eight with a mite of help . " " What line of work you followin ' now , Fort ? " Fort stood up and extended his right arm . Dove reached to shake it but Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad condition ? " he asked softly . Dove studied him carefully . " Your eyes look shut sort of , " he decided . " Why , then lead me , goodbuddy , " Fort asked without opening a lid . " Lead me . " Dove rose dutifully and led the big man once about the room . " Now that 's all there is to it , " Fort took off his glasses and opened his eyes . " Now was n't that easy ? " " We had a blind Indian home name of Chicken-Eye Riley , " Dove recalled , " Wore a tuckin ' - comb . But he never went around with his eyes shut . Did n't have to : He 'd been gouged . " " Indians do n't have to fake it , " Fort revealed resentfully , " all you got to be to get sent to a reservation these days is be some damned kind of Indian . The government 'll be given out pensions for bein ' Ilebrew next . A white man do n't stand a chance no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off complainingand used his executive-type voice  --  " You understand this is merely a temporary expedient until we get up a stake to get us into the oil business , goodbuddy ? " " I do n't follow you , Fort . " " In Cameron County between Harlingen and Rio Hondo . Half a day 's hike from your own hometown . All we need to get it is to give the Sinclair man twenty dollar for a tankful of gas . He 'll furnish us cots and blankets out of his own attic . One of us takes care of the pump and the other buys up producefrom the Mex farmers round about and wholesales it inp171the valley stores . The Sinclair man do n't have to know about the produce . So long as one of us is at the pumps when he calls is all that matters . You dig as good as you sell coffee to Negras , Red ? " Dove rolled up his eyes like a doll 's . " I can dig real good for I 'm bedcord strong  --  what do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  one on each side of the station ! You dig one and I dig the other ! " " To be part owner of a gas station , " Dove offered dreamily , " I 'd start to work before good day . I 'll dig ' em both sides . " " There 's a deal , goodbuddy . " " When do we start , Fort ? " " Soon as you lead me around a couple days . Then I 'll lead you . " " What do I do when the policeman comes up ' n sees I 'm not really blind ? " " Never said you was , " Fort explained , " all your sign says is Help Me . ' " " Do n't hardly seem fair after we whupped them so bad , " it struck Dove . " Whupped policemen ? " " No . Indians . " " Stop worrying about Indians . What you got to realize is the blind eye do n't reflect the light but yours do . That 's why you got to keep them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around with them open , people take one look and slip you a buck or two . Over and above that you get a state pension . " " I do ? " " Not you . Really blind people . " " So do Indians . That 's why I figure to be a blind Indian must be the best deal a person could have . Still , this fellow back home did n't have it none too good . In fact he spent all his weekends in jail . "  | " They 're strong for that firewater , or so I 've heard , " Fort agreed impatiently . " Were n't firewater . It was a sow Riley was so strong for . He 'd find his way to her guided solely by the sense of smell and his wife would come home and find him missing . She 'd go down to the sty and put the flashlight on and there they 'd be . That woman got so jealous of that beast she had Riley locked up every Friday night . " " I allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got loose Monday morning , " Fort conceded . " He never bothered her weekdays , " Dove reported , " just when his wife were n't well . He spent day after day in the domino parlor and seldom lost . He could tell every piece by running his fingers over it once . " Fort sighed . " Either that or he could n't find her during the week . As I say , he was guided entirely by a sense of smell . " Fort got him back on the main highway , " Do n't you go gawking . Just look straight ahead and keep saying Who is it ? Who is it ? Who 's there ? Who is it ? ' " " Who 's there ? Who is it ? " " That 's right . You 're learning . " " Who 's there ? Who is it ? " " You can open them now . I 'm going to let you lead me until you get the hang of the thing , " Fort promised . " Sunday morning in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars . " " That leak 'll be wide by morning if this rain keeps up , " Dove judged . And blinked up to where the next drop clung , lost its grip and plunged , to become one with the eternal waters . " How would you like to eat at the best restaurant in town tonight , Tex ? Set down at a white tablecloth right amongst the people who got this thing whipped and tell a waiter what to bring you ? "  | " Thank you kindly all the same , but I lack the means to return the favor . " " Tell you what , Tex , " Fort persisted , " you go on the blink with me and I give you my word of honor here and now , the day we get a stake we throw away the glasses . Think it over , son . , , Dove thought it over as long as it took for two more drops to ping into the dishpan . " My stated intent is to rise in the world , " he decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street just do n't seem the proper way . In fact I 'd rather see my box a-comin ' than to be led by another as though I were helpless , when all the while I can just about see through that wall . " " Opportunity has knocked , " Fort announced like an undertaker . " Opportunity is now going through that door . Opportunityaint coming back . " And left like a man who would search all day , and half the night if need be , for the right flavor of chocolate ice . To leave Dove alone to tote up the chances a single day had offered . " I could of took a position as a leader of the blind but I turned it down . That 's one . I could be a plain condom mechanicwith a chance to do fancy work should I qualify . That 's two and I ai nt yet turned down the second . The way things are coming my way today it must be hard times are over . " He went to the window to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun was out . He was about to turn away from the window when he caught a brief glimpse of a sun he had never seen before . It was hiding behind the corner of an eave like a chicken thief at dusk . Dove stood quietly to see what its next move would be , thinking itself unseen . Sure enough , it edged softly off , showed a bit more of itself  --  a sneak thief sun , a sun with a hooded look . A sun of the alley stalls ready to do anything for a fiver. ' love did n't want to see what a sun like that was up to . Hep174opened his Bull Durham sack and sure enough , folded neatly quartered so as to let him read the " loo " without unfolding it , Finnerty 's c-note still waited to be spent . " As long as I done it , it was just as well I got paid , " he philosophized his guilt away . Out in the lake-palmed suburbs , far from the dong and the glare , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soundless stair . The stilly stair to 0-Daddyland in a pale hygienic glow . Feeling some sign he could not read must say ZONE OF QUIET . For the weather in the streets , and the seasons there , are no more permitted in 0-Daddyland than in a surgeon 's washroom . Rainwinds washing children 's voices have nothing to do with 0-Daddies . Step up in an airless quarantine , go down a passionless hall . Stand before a door without knocker or bell . Till an anesthetic odor , as of gas or seeping ether , trails from below ; as though abortions might be performed here . Stranger on a strange-lit stair , you have come to a strange frontier . The frontier of a principality whose only law is Rhino Gross and Gross 's many moods . A totalitarian state whose single industry is a curious craft in Goodrich rubber , worked out in forms sufficiently fanciful . Rhino Gross is his state 's sole industrial designer and Gross is a fanciful man . Indeed , abortions are aborted here . ( At night in the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scraaap of his curette against the uterus wall in a room that holds no other sound . Scraaap scraaap scraaap . ) Now the daylight man , ex-physician , ex-abortionist , exquack , ex-con , ex-man , ex-everything , enfolded and armored by layer across layer of swart encrusted fat , clasping his distendedgut to keep it from slipping down over his rusted truss , is an aging animal come to the jungle 's rim whose hear/ing is excellent but whose sight is waterish , ready to turn at a tiny twig 's crack and lumber back to his forest 's protecting gloom . Yet stands one moment snout upturned and quivering , to sniff the dangerous air : now he is wondering whether it would be perfectly safe to try a little mock-charge on whoeverthat was across the room . Dove caught a good strong whiff of the sniffer at the jungle'srim without knowing that what he whiffed was actually burning rubber . When you work with guano you live with guano till you smell of guano . Gross 's hide was impregnated with it clear down to his money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disbarred gynecologist could have devised that technicolor fantasy so long before technicolor , of liverishyellow dipped at its obscene head in firehouse red and tipped by a delicate rainbow silken as baby 's first down ? An improvement in style , function and line worthy of its proudname 0-Daddy , The Condom of Tomorrow . ) " First you learn your craft , " Gross told Dove . " How else do I tell what you 're worth ? " Then deciding to show Whoever-It-Wasthat he really was a furious charger at heart , lowered his snout and trumpeted terribly  --  " Welma ! Welma ! " A swift light step and there materialized a woman whose life had been consumed . She may have been thirty-five or sixty but was n't quite through burning yet . She was wearing a rubber apron over a gum-colored dress and pigtails bound by a big pink bow that bounced as if the very hair were rubberized . Apparently her sight was n't much better than Gross 's , for she stood dangling one glove , specs in hand , lookingabout for some way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length she stooped , brought up a corner of her slip far enough to serve as a lens-cleaner . " Look the bow ribbon ! " Gross squeaked with mocking glee  --  " Welma the wulcanized woomin ! Ai nt a wife ! Ai nt a mother ! "  --  his voice turned stern with shame for her  --  " What are you ? You think a bow ribbon makes a woomin ? "  |p176The  woman snapped her specs on and beamed upon Dove through them as benignly as if Rhino 's derision had been praise . " He 'll mouse on me and he 'll mouse on you , " she explainedwithout heat . " He 's a forty-faced pigeon straight from Rat Row , quack from head to toe . Rather steal from his mother than ride a passenger train and I give him eighty percentthe best of it at that . Now if you want to see how we get these things out come back here and I 'll show you how . " The kitchen , so commodious it might once have served as a slave quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small molds of individualized design . About the molds stood cans of liquid rubber , open paint-tins and brushes soaking in solutions . Above a wide white oven a line of 0-Daddies hung like sausages to dry . This was also the place where Cupid 's Arrows came warm off the forge and Ticklish Tessies lounged about . The craze in Laughing Maggies had almost died but Ding-Dong Darlings had a promising future . Happy Hannahs roomed here ; Barney Googles were having their noses pinched by clothes-pins on a wire line . Ilere Gross moved Love 's Fancies by the gross ; and a reddish dust lay over everything . For the 0-Daddy was not the only creation of the hand and heart and brain of this dishonored genius . It was only his masterpiece . Yet through the air made thick by gum , by paint , by turpentine , Dove smelled something better than any of these  --  something was doing inside that oven for sure . When Velma peered in he caught a glimpse of a chicken roasting on a bed of yams . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it means when he hollers is he 's scared . I 'm sure I do n't know what he 's scared of because there 's nobody here but me . The creature is ill of bad conscience and do n't have long to go . " " I did n't pay him particular heed , " Dove told her , " but your ribbon bow strikes me as mighty purty , m'am. "  | " Thank you , son . " She seemed genuinely flattered . " Now let me show you how to turn out a condom you can trust . " Painting a skin with a film of liquid gum , she nodded her head to indicate that Gross was listening at the kitchen door and deliberately spoke loudly enough for the old man to overhear . " He 'll give it out that his only trouble is that Broomfacewants a word with him , but that ai nt his real worry . He 's a man with a double-W on his forehead and Broomface is the least of it . Those other parties who would like a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gross 's big head came through the door : " Old-time shoplifterstealing all her life ! " he announced like a station caller . " Wanted by everyone but the church ! One hand over her heart and the other in your pocket ! " He slammed the door before she could insult him in turn . Velma the Vulcanized Woman , Dove saw , retained a faint copperish tint to her ash-blond hair and her face bore traces of Saxon beauty . She was humanized as well as vulcanized , he perceived . " Every bare window in this town reminds me of Arkansas , " she admitted to Dove . " I might as well be in jails as the way I am . " Sitting at the window she looked out upon a world of rogues with innocence and wonder , and both her cheekbones smashed . Her ash-blond bangs , streaked broadly now with gray , belied the fact that there was n't much on the books Velma had n't tried and a few deals she 'd thought up by herself . Goin ' to town Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , and answeredJust a great big bag of candy and a J. C. Stetson hatShe came of a long line of country thieves that had grown shrewd in the mountains . Velma had grown yet shrewder in town . And at last , too shrewd to trust on the common high/way , had become the shrewdest inmate at the Women 's Reformatoryat Aldington . Not yet twenty when she 'd been first sent up , she had immediately distinguished herself by saying to a colored matron  --  " Hold this for me "  --  and had shoved a tableknife with a friction-taped handle into the woman 's abdomen . " Will you spread a clean cloth for dinner ? " she asked Dove , " You 'll find one in that bureau . " Velma spread the clean cloth with Southern variety  --  okra , clobber , cornbread , yams , rice , chicken , onion gravy and sweet potato pie . But Dove had never seen anyone eat like Gross . Velma did n't even bother to lay a knife , fork and spoon for him . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time he dropped a fried egg , to get every bit of it on his pants . " Mighty fine chicken , m'am , " Dove congratulated her . The chicken was fine , the yams were dandy , the gravy was great and the clobber was super . Unluckily the small reddish dust had gotten into the food as into everything , so it all came to a single dish : rubber . Gross liked the taste of rubber . When you work with rubber you not only eat rubber , but your very dreams arrive in rubberized folds . Within twenty-four hours Dove looked and smelled like Velma the Vulcanized Woman herself . Those were n't dead ants between his toes but only particles fallen from the Flap-Happy mold that had worked their way down his socks . They poured the rubber and heated the glue , forged the forms and painted the skins , glued the feathers and hung the 0-Daddies and sorted the seconds and burned the culls and filled the orders ; and never went dancing down below . Velma taught Dove never to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let an 0-Daddy wander among the Happy Hannahs . When the sun beat steadily they riskedp179hanging a line to dry against an outside wall ; when it rained or was overcast the big room was full of skins hanging in rainbowedrows above the dark gas range 's flame . In the evening the three outcasts sat in the dark of their old strange house , hearing human voices rise and fall . There was an amusement park at the end of the wide-palmed street , letting laughter come to them from a place where human life was lived out on roller-coasters ; while they endured the rubberishdark of 0-Daddyland like three ghosts yet to be born . " Son , " Gross always began his nightly lecture with the same phrase , " Son , not all the 0-Daddies are hanging on a line . There 's one sitting right here in this rocker . Would you mind either turning the lamp down a bit or else not look directlyat me ? I have a little aversion to being examined . Thank you . " Dove turned a bit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a man of two great weaknesses , either one of which may ruin you . Women and whiskey , in that order . Take my advice , if you do n't want to wind up being one more Barney Google like me . First thing you ought to do is throw away that shirt . Never wear light colors . They catch the sun . Blue is best  --  mailman blue . The whole secret of not ending up an 0-Daddy on a line is to look as much like a mailman as possible  --  who knows what the mailman looks like ? Who 'd recognize him if he changed suits ? Get a cap with a peak that shadows the eyes . Wear glasses that throw back the light . Grow a mustache but do n't go into bars . If you must drink , lock the door and drink by yourself . Conviviality leads to fist-fighting , fist-fighting leads to rage . Look out for rage , son . People never forget a man they 've seen in a rage . " My own appearance was always such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch attention . I always fitted into the bystander'smemory , so that five minutes after a rumble , my description , complete to hat-size , would be at headquarters . " Watch out for the inclination to trust , particularly towardp180women . It leads to giving . Look out for that one , it 's the worst of a bad lot . " Watch out for flowers , watch out for trust , watch out for women , watch out for giving . In short , do n't give flowers to a woman you trust . " " He 'll come to the point in time . Just have patience , " Velma assured Dove . " No woman since the world began , " the old man kept trying to say what he meant , " ever accepted a flower as no more than a token of affection . Does she seem pleased at a gift so humble ? What , a daisy for me ? ' Why should n't she be pleased ? it 's a down payment on your hand , your heart and your brain and she knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a daisy you owe a box of candy , and how long do you think you 're going to get by just on candy and flowers ? Where 's the perfume ? Progress , that 's what women want in a man . What is more natural than the step from perfume to wristwatch  --  now let 's see how long you can keep from mentioningengagement rings . Your very silence betrays that you 're considering marriage and are only trying to get up the courage to ask . Son , you 're good as done . You 're in hock to a house , a car , children , maid  --  you give up your freedom and there still has n't been a word said about what does she oweyou ? " Why , that goes without saying  --  she 's giving you her virginalwhite body , is n't she ? Do n't throw it up to her that you 're giving her your little pink body , that 's cad 's work  --  no , son , you 'll never get your daisy back . But you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like any job except that you do n't get three weeks off with pay . If you try , your friends will fill in for you . Why do you think they pay me two dollars for a contraceptive that tickles if it is n't because they 're afraid that the cat is starting to slip ? " Look for the woman ' they tell us  --  but I take it one step farther than that . Look at them sperms ' is what I advise . Son ,  |p181did  you know that under a microscope every sperm looks exactly like his old man when the old man has a jag on ? There he is , the old man all over again , with no particular place to go or if he has , he 's forgotten it . Just staggering from pole to pole , up one street and down the next , can hardly tell one door from the next , just hoping somebody he knows will let him in . Really not doing anybody any harm . All of a sudden a lady sperm  --  looks exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' n whispers  --  ' in here , Jack . ' Pulls him in and latches it . Now you know where all our troubles start ? " Look out for love , look out for trust , look out for giving . Look out for wine , look out for daisies and people who laugh readily . Be especially wary of friendship , Son , it can only lead to trouble . And it is n't your enemies who 'll get you deepest into the soup , it 's your friends . " You might keep that in mind if you 're ever called upon to point the finger of accusation and say that 's the very man . ' Remember that you have to be absolutely certain , son . If you have the leastest leastest doubt it 's your highest highest duty to say you 're not absolutely absolutely sure . Do you realize that if you sent a man to prison on a wrong identification you 're a criminal yourself , little better than a hardened mur-derer ? " " He 's cutting in a little closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for once Gross spoke directly to her , " does n't an old man have the right to die in his own bed ? " The vulcanized woman made no reply . Her chair was vacant . She had tiptoed out just to make the old man sweat in anxiety  --  " Where 'd she go ? How long she been gone ? Why did n't you speak up ? " " I think she 's in the bedroom , mister , " Dove told him , and waited dutifully for the rest of the speech while Gross went to listen at the bedroom door . Satisfied that she had n't yet crossed the frontier , he returned to his rocking chair ; but had no more to say that evening.  | ( In the deep dark and dead time the old man hears the soft scraaap scraaap and feels the sudden sinking through the uterus wall and the blood running over his hand again . The uterus wall that , once pierced , bleeds till no blood remains . 0 , Old Gross remembers a thing or two in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unendurable twilight land , a land of in between , with a woman whom he had married in order to make her his prisoner . Now the prisoner was the jailer , he the captive . Velma not only had enough on him to send him to the pen for keeps , but also those inside-the-walls connectionsthat Gross feared more than the uniformed law . He knew that she could have him disposed of without the bother of having him carried through federal gates . In any one day she had only to pick up a telephone and he would n't see his rocking chair that night . Dove 's function , he soon saw , was simply to perform errandsthat Velma would otherwise have had to do . The only ease the old man knew was when she was at work right under his nose . Whatever he had coming , it seemed , he wanted to see it come . Yet Gross went on little errands of his own that did n't bother Velma at all . Every morning she wrapped a small package in gift paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man 's arm and sent him off with it . He would be back in less than an hour without the package . It was some days before Dove saw that all the paper contained was garbage . " He leaves it on a street car or a newsstand for someone to find , thinking they 've found something of value and hurry home to undo it , and there it is . What else can an old man do for fun ? " It seemed to Dove there must be something else even for an old man.  |p183How  she had found him out , here in the lake-palmed suburb where the rise and dying fall of a roller coaster and bonfires on the beach of Lake Pontchartrain made summer sweet , Gross did n't want to know . He had married her in a last despairinghope of winning her loyalty legally . The woman had wanted a home of her own all her life . She knew a good thing when she found it . Marriage had turned out to be no more than a down payment from Gross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned and did n't have to bother arguing with him except to indulge him . It was his table manners she found most difficult to indulge . " I swear I never before did see a man dip oyster crackers in coffee , " she commented across the table to Dove . Yet Gross went on dipping placidly . The whole front of his shirt was greased with droppings from his fingers . " It could be they never seen a oyster cracker in Arkansas , " he goaded her a bit by tipping the coffee into the saucer so that most of it spilled onto the cloth . " What was it you said you got run out of Arkansas for ? I always forget . " " The point is n't who got run out , " Velma corrected him , " the point is who they would n't let in . I swear I never before did see a man dip oyster crackers in coffee . " " Talk to my ass , " Gross told her , " my head is hard . " She went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was drying , and Dove saw her dab furtively at her eyes . " I 've taken all the insults I 'm going to off that cliffape , " she warned Gross aloud , " it 's more than natural flesh can bear . " Dove patted her gently . " He do n't mean harm , ma'am . It 's his way of showing affection is all . " Velma would have none of such affection . " That man would be rode out of town on a rail where I come from . " " Look ! " the old man commanded her triumphantly from across the kitchen , " Look ! I 'm sopping up ! "  |p184Velma  was a kind of cross between a gadfly and a ferret , but like many people streaked by violence , usually maintained a deep serenity . In which she sang not unpleasantly , It all seems wrong somehow That you 're nobody 's baby nowand went serenely on molding skins and painting them , clamping , drying , sorting , Blueing , counting , counting days till the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his bed rather than by violence . She would not give the old man the peace that such knowledgewould have afforded him . Perhaps she feared that , once allowed to relax , he might just live on and on . After all , she had had a hard enough time and did n't have tor far to go herself . She could no longer afford pity . So all night long the old man was up and down in his flannel nightshirt , hiding his money in one place or another . He would unscrew the top of a bedpost , drop a couple twentiesdown the hollow of it , then forget to screw the top-piece down . He had as many stashes as a squirrel in October and one of his favorites was the water box above the old-fashioned plumbing . He would bind a bankroll into a condom , fasten it tightly and tie it to the waterworks . But when he heard it flushing , and Velma would issue forth , he would race in there to stand on the seat to see if she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had found him out in everything so thoroughlyshe had no need of following him around . When she needed money she picked his pocket , that was all there was to it . If the pocket was bare she went to his bookshelf and leafed through a few volumes until a bill or two floated out . The old man had no way of banking without betraying his whereabouts . Season of heat when skins dry fast below the copper blaze of noon or flashflood spring when pipes back up and coloredp185clothespins clamp the skins in rainbowed rows above the dark gas-range 's flames , they pour the rubber and heat the glue , clean the molds and forge the forms and never go dancing down below . " When you start hitting toward sixty , " Gross complained , " you feel some days like you want to take a cab to the graveyardand wait for your maker beside your stone . Yet when you 've not had an hour 's true contentment out of all those sixty years , you do n't want to lay down till you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pain . " " Maybe if you 'd give more to others , like our Lord said to do , " Velma reminded him , " you 'd of got more . Maybe if you 'd change your ways you 'd still have your hour . " " If that advice came from anyone else I might heed it , " Gross admitted . " Coming from you it makes no sense . How do I change old bones for new ? It was n't give to me to live so I could give to others . With me it was a matter of take or die . " " You did n't have to try to take it all to keep from dying , " Velma pointed out . " I took all I could , that 's true , " Gross admitted , " now you take all from me . Here . " He crooked his little finger toward her . " Pull . " One night Dove woke to hear the old man shouting , " Oldtimeshoplifter ! Stealing all her life ! " He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood with both fists . " Give me a hand , boy ! We got her trapped in the act ! " Betweenhis shouts the plumbing kept flushing  --  the moment the waters had rushed once and risen , down they rushed like a thundering falls again . A light shown from under the door . It sounded like Velma might be drowning in the waterworks . But when they yanked the door open , the place was empty . How she had contrived to start the fixture flushing automaticallyDove never discovered . Yet there she lay , feigning sleepp186in her own virgin-white bed all the while , her country-grocer shoes at the foot of it and her cotton stockings hung neatly over a chair . Dove got the plumbing quieted first , then quieted the old man . When he heard him fall back into a restless sleep he rose softly and dressed . He had had enough of rubber . He stood at the old man 's bedside until he was sure it was safe , then carefully unscrewed one of the bedposts . He had the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so close behind him he stiffened right where he stood . " That one is empty , son , " he heard her say , " look under the hallway rug . " From under the hall rug he pulled out a flattened parcel of bills and a minute later was losing himselr in the shadows of that wide-palmed street . And when he thought , later , of that strange-lit stair and the rubberish nights and days he had spent there he remembered it like a dream dreamt by somebody else . Once he went back , out of curiosity , but could no longer find it . And began to wonder whether there ever really had been a place where 0-Daddies hung on a wire line above a low-burning flame . And a reddish dust hung over everything . That was no town for the aged or the aging . There was love behind the curtains and love behind the doors . Love in the squares and circles and love along the curbs . Particularly along those curbs west of the Southern RailwayStation . Where every window framed some love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cage . What had been Storyville was now an aviary . " Come on in , daddy , we do n't bite , " they invited the strollingvoyeur , or pretended to vie with one another as he passed on . " I 'll take him . " From wheatland and tenement , hotel and harbor , girls andp187women of a hundred feathers had come to nest both sides of South Basin . Girls downy as chicks who have just lost their mammas and chorus-line dolls who had long lost their down . Girls who came scolding like winter jays , ruffing their tail feathers and ready for battle . But some like little wrens of summer , seeking hollows to hide in forever . At evening they watched the stricken street from their windows like sea-birds seeing a sunless sea darken and recede . " Daddy , if you do n't come ' n get me I 'll just throw myself away ! " " Daddy , come in , we 'll have great fun "  --  but it was n't great fun for a woman accustomed to Northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamp burned out in the night , feeling drained and doomed in a stall whose floor looked as if customers might start coming up through the planks . The bedbugs that clung in grape-like clusters to the springs , the cracked enamel basin , the old-fashioned bureau , the greasy portiere that served as a door ; the drawling in the hallway and the mosquitoes wanting out , all agreed  --  " Baby , you 've been had . Baby , you 've been had . " Droning all night long . You 've been had , you 've been paid for , you 've been rented by the minute . Now anything goes no matter how wild so long as it keeps off the Storyville Blues . It was cocaine , it was whiskey  --  who would n't get the blues ? It was brawling in the alleys , it was falling on the floor . It was everything to give and not a thing to lose . It was men , it was gin , it was all night long . It was have a ball and spend it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do just what you want with me . " That was what they called fun on old Perdido Street . Who would n't get the blues ? Big-town girls found the anything-goes life of the cribs tougher going than the girls from orchards and barns . Farm girls could come on rough as cobs . But the coaltown and cotton-mill kids took to it easiest of all . Hard times didn'tp188mean a thing to them  --  they had never known another kind . They were n't afraid of law , jail or even , seemingly , of infection . The anthractite had entered their hearts . Every time an operator padlocked a mine or a mill in West Virginia , Alabama , Kentucky , Pennsylvania or Southern Illinois , a fresh flock of chicks ' would hit town and start turning tricks for the price of a poor-boy sandwich and a bottle of Dr. Pepper 's . They were thin , big-boned girls , and when they fought they did n't go for the air or eyes . They went for belly or jaw , with fists . They fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and city chicks . To name only a few things they did with the greater will . " Give us your money  --  you 're drunk , " with last right 's gin still crippling their tongues they taunted the teetotaling boys in tortoise shell specs from Loyola and Tulane . Boys working on sociological theses who 'd been told there was fun down on Perdido Street . " Professor ! Let me talk to you ! Did you come down for what I think you come ? You just came to look ? Girls ! Specs came just to look ! Okay Professor  --  look at what brought you here ! Same thing that 'll take you away ! "  --  the women 's shrieks would deride the looking-man down the street and into the winding avenues of all his voyeur 's dreams : curious streets where he walked as the last of earth 's bachelors , hearingwindow-women snicker as he passed . In those dreams it was always the women 's turn to stare . Hard lines , hard times , when soft girls grew hard and hard girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a whisper , " Daddy , you name it , I 'm on my last legs . " For men sometimes came down there looking for someone to push over the brink or someone to save  --  it was all the same . Play Christ or play devil but pay your damned dollar . For two you could play both . For the lion that roars loudest at the bleat of thep189sheep there was lots of fun on Perdido Street . The sibilant hiss from the narrow dark was for a specialized clientele . Not Yet Twenties bold or humble . Lost or captured , lucklessor loose . The dark and the fair from everywhere who would have been safely married in Minneapolis or Seattle , Kennebunkport or San Francisco had Old Guard economics not demanded more Coca Cola love and less housekeeping . Minnesota girls with hair heaped like ripe wheat : a northernsun shone yet in hair like that . In the eyes of the girls from San Francisco big slow soundless ocean fogs rolled to their final shore . Behind the eyes of the Oregon girls it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raining behind the eyes of Oregon girls . Girls with western turnings in their talk and girls with the midland twanging . Who wore their hair long like Anna Q. Nillson or braided like Ann Harding 's . Bobbed or banged or flowing to the shoulders , rose-red girls or sallow , they wore their hair in all the styles , they softened their mouths in all the wiles that good girls did . Sick or silly , maimed or strayed , fresh-fallen leaf or sear , the Storyville hustler chattered as cheerfully about husbands and wives , washday and landlords , lost chances and chances left as the good girls did . And kept souvenirs of their luckier hours , lockets and albums , letters and rings , exactly as good girls did . If she had married a ponce now doing a stretch , the girls who had married legitimate men felt a twist of envy toward her  --  but is n't that what good girls often did ? She borrowed from one boy friend to give to another , betrayedthose who had helped her in order to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as though she were something that ran on all fours and all the while had some mark completely convinced that she would n't go to bed with a man to whom she was n't legally wed though he hungp190jellybeans on pineapple trees . Now was n't that just how good girls occasionally did ? Good girls and bad carried on so much alike , in the cheery old summer of 1931 , a Yankee might well have been deceived . The Southern boy was a bit harder to fool . The moment he saw a girl behind a door screen naked to her navel and lifting her breasts , he sensed something was up . When she did a slow spread-legged grind and threw in a blinding bump for good measure , he suspected it was n't free . When she opened the door and said , " Step in , I do n't bite , " he went in , of course , out of simple courtesy . But he was n't fooled : she was after , his money , that was all . No , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the white rain ran with the red-lit rain and Perdido Street doors stood wide . Where here and there , between dance hall and dive , some nightingale stood with the weight of her shame so fresh upon her that she could n't as yet invite someoneeven though she had n't that day bitten food . ( Nobody knew where these silent girls came from . Nor whether their eyes , searching inward , saw a disheveled and bloodstained bed or a new cash register . Whether they were eaten alive by regret as they stood or merely counted in indifference to everything : one dollar , two dollars , three and four , when I get eight I 'll get me a dress of tropical pink . When I get twenty-two I 'll get pink slippers too . ) Birds of a hundred varied feathers , hooters , hissers , howlers , quackers  --  it was a new kind of zoo wherein the captured foraged for themselves . Some were feebs and some were loonies , some were tattoed girls . There were peep shows and side shows , fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princess . There were n't enough keepers to handle the stock . Panders who had never had more than two women tapping , found themselves without enough windows to go around . Five or sixp191all yammering at once for her turn at door or pane , vying with one another to be top broad for daddy . It was a daddy 's market , but daddy had to take care all the same . Oliver Finnerty , ex-exercise boy and currently proprietor of six peepholes on the second floor of Spider-Boy Court , once having incurred a debt of ninety days to the parish jail , had turned over a girl to a friend in the trade for safekeeping . Oliver had expended a great deal of time and thought on this child , for he 'd seen her promise early . He had told her , " Baby you go with this man , and when he says , Walk pretty , ' you walk pretty all the way . " And to the friend : " Do n't whip her where it 'll leave her marked , or she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now good luck and God bless the both of you . " Ninety days later , his debt paid in full , Finnerty had returned to reclaim his property only to find her wearing a long black dress and a pince-nez , and his colleague out digging ditches . Something had gone wrong . Finnerty had had to spend that whole day talking the girl back into her lounging pajamas . By the time the friend returned from work , a black lunch bucket under his arm , Finnerty 's patience had been exhausted . " Just look what you done to his girl , " he berated the BenedictArnold of Panderdom . " You took a nice sweet kid and twisted her all up . You undone all my good work . " Then he raised the girl 's hair off her neck and began cracking her patiently , without hatred or heat , but mechanically , with contentmentin a job he was the right man for . And like a good little whore she stood and took it , for she knew very well she had it coming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for full pardon . But Benedict Arnold would never be pardoned : when this sort of thing happened it was n't the girl 's fault . Now he could only sit mute and miserable , knowing he 'd never be allowedp192to drink among honest pimps again . But would instead drink in crumb-dump taverns where working men play dominoes for nickels and envy those who get to work on Saturday too . Oh , if only Oliver would give him one more chance ! Oliver would n't violate his principles . When the whipping was done , the pince-nez crushed and the long black dress in the garbage can , he turned to his ex-colleague and finished him crisply . " You . Pick up your lunch bucket and get back in your ditch . " Dishonored , disbarred , a disgrace to right-thinking procurors , the **25;9906;TOOLONG shuffled wearily , without a word of goodbye , out onto a street that other unch buckets had laid long ago . And was never seen in respectable circles again . Finnerty , who looked like one of those little Australian foxes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be five foot but had to be wearing his cowboy boots to make good the boast . " Aching Chopper 's giving me trouble again , " he would complain of the girl who had been with him longest , the moonfacedChicago blonde . " I know she been faithful as a broad can be but her teeth give me trouble . It 's a new plate now near every month . I 'm supporting half the dentists in town . " " If you 'd stop busting her in the mouth you would n't have to support that many , " the mulatto woman once called Lucille suggested . Oliver owned five women , a single-motored plane and a captive mouse . He claimed to be the first pander in the entire South to transport women by plane . A claim making every single one of the five proud of their five-foot daddy . He 'd crowd all five into the single motor , deposit one on the outskirts of Baton Rouge , two near Hammond ( where a fast track was operating at the time ) and take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his motive wasp193to save time , but to his brothel brothers he readily admitted that the idea was really to save listening to all that yakking  --  " I ca n't bear to be with one broad a whole half day , not to mention five . " He had the identical weakness , as a pilot , that he had had as an apprentice jockey . He 'd get so high on Panama pot that he could n't make up his mind . On a horse he had never known whether to go for the whip or tighten rein so that sometimes he had done both at once . In a plane , with five silly women high as himself and every one giving him orders , he would n't be able to decide whether to land on roadway or grass . The road burned up the plane 's tires so badly it would mean a new set  --  but the risk of flipping over on the grass , inviting loss of his working principal , was even greater . The second the women saw that Daddy was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One would decide for the roadway and grab for the stick simply to have her own way . But one of more economical habits , wishing to say later she had saved him a whole set of tires , would scream right in his ear , " Idiot ! On the grass ! The grass ! " At the very last possiblesecond he would holler , " I ca n't please everybody , " fling out both fists and make earth in a shrieking , careening lurch like a chute-the-chutes hitting water . Road or grass , the women loved it . It was a kind of thrill not another pimp livingcould provide . Small wonder that to say " Finnerty swings her " afforded a girl real distinction among the women of PerdidoStreet . The mouse was one that had barely gotten away from I-Ia1-lie 's lame brindle cat . The cat , that belonged to one woman who would have nothing to do with Finnerty , had been going on three legs so long that it no longer killed , it crippled . After she had crippled it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the juke . Finnerty had fished it out and given it a home in a little box with a cellophane window that had once held face powder . When he had to induct a new girl , orp194to straighten up an old one growing recalcitrant , he took her to watch the mouse . His own face would be expressionless as he and the girl saw it trying for freedom in spite of all pain . He said nothing while it hauled its wrecked hindquarters around and around . Just as it seemed the animal had made good its escape at last , he would plop it back in its box and say to the girl , " When you get as much sense as this mouse we 'll get along better , little baby , " and close the box . It was a warning that she ought to try to do better by her little daddy , lest he had to put his mittens on . " Daddy dear , " his Chicago blonde once complained , " take me to the hospital , I got to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head on her hands . " I ca n't afford to be carting you in and out of cperating rooms twice a month , " her pander told her , " every time you go you 're out of action for days . One more visit and by God you get everything took out . Make up your mind to that , Aching Choppers  --  I said everything . This piddling around with part of a gut at a time disgusts me . " " But Little Daddy , why get disgusted ? " the girl wanted to know , " if you went to a doctor about a little prostate trouble , say , you would n't want the man to cut off your balls , would you ? A woman got things she do n't want to lose neither , Little Daddy . " " Do n't give me that , " her little daddy closed the discussion , " you can get along without all that crazy stuff . " " That 's no way to talk to a girl , not even a pimp ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of everyone . " The good book tells us A woman is as a precious fruits in a garden shut up . ' " " Shut up is correct , " Finnerty commanded , " and anyone who says I ever hit any woman with anything bigger than a small housebrick is a coon-assed liar . " He was as heavy in the shoulders and arms as a well-grown six-footer and the right arm bore a strange tattoo : A narrowp195cigarette whose smoke formed a burning boast : KING WEEDHEAD . How much good this would do him in event of a pinch he never explained , and modestly disowned the implication of the tattoo . " It do n't really mean I 'm the king of the weedheads , or course , " he pointed out , " it just means that as a weedhead I 'm a king . " His distinctions were sometimes too fine to follow , and actually were n't worth the bother of followinganyhow . He 'd been known to trade off a woman no older than thirty-five for a twenty dollar bill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been unfaithful to him . Faithful or not , if you threw in half a can of greenish tea with the twenty , he was ready to let loose of almost any one of his women . Except , of course , Reba , for to her Finnerty had been true : had n't he once been offered a cartload of green bananas plus a full can of potoguaya for her and turned the whole deal down ? But before letting that offer go he had taken a look at the tea , that had been of a light greenish cast . " If it had been the real boge , " he admitted later , " I could n't have answered for my actions . " Meaning , by boge , the deep-purple plant that only grows on Mount Popocatepetl . He went in for broad stripes and coats almost to his knees , sometimes draped out and sometimes semi-clad  --  a man a full ten years ahead of his time with eyes as pale as the whiskey in his glass . " Oh , how I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd complain . " Why do I do it ? " " You might throw away that thirty-eight , " Lucille advised him again . " Why , then I 'd be without help , " Finnerty told her in mildsurprise . She was his housekeeper and was half-fond of him . Yet when asked by a stranger , half-amused at the outrageouslittle sport in cowboy boots and smelling of cologne ,  | " How tall are you , Shorty ? " Finnerty had replied , " About ass-high to a tall Indian . You figure you 're higher ? " The stranger answered softly , " I figure we 're about the same height , mister . " " That ai nt good enough . " " Could be you 're a little higher . " Yet if he really liked you he 'd warm right up . " I 've decided not to bury you , " he 'd congratulate you then , " I 've made up my mind I 'm on your side against everybody . I 'm not even going to drop you . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to start with you . " Once Oliver was on your side he 'd stay right at your side . He knew you needed him . And who could deny so close a friend certain small favors , such as buying him drirks all afternoon ? What would be left of a friendship that could n't stand up under a few whiskies ? Of women he asked no favor . They had no more side for a man to be on than so many fishes in a stream . Indeed , they were so many fishes . And the bait with which he hooked them hardly varied . It was the immemorial chicken farm story procurershave used since procuring began : " We do n't spend our money foolish like other couples , little baby , " the story went . " They wo n't catch us wasting it on strong drink and folly . After all , you and I both know you 're no more a whore at heart than I 'm a pimp . We 're just a lover and his little sweetheart up against it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and everything will be perfect . So much in the bank every week come rain or come shine . I did n't want to tell you this , sweetheart , I wanted to save it as a surprise , but I 've had my eye on a little chicken farm upstate for you and me for some time now . We get that for ourselves , just you and me , little baby , and in five years we 're on Easy Street . The day we move in we stop by the justice of the peace , little sweetheart . Because if you take care of me in the little things I 'm going to take care of you in the big ones . "  |p197What  kind of a little sweetheart would it be who would n't take care of Lover in little things till he got on his feet again ? But the weeks stretched into three and the three into a month . The months to six and a year passed by , and she took care of Lover in the little things and he took care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jail or visited her there when he could n't . He saw that she always had enough tricks and never let them come on too strong . He saved her from drunks , thieves , pederasts and fiends , and once or twice a year took her fishing with him . But nothing was said about chicken farming any more . Once , long after it was too late for farming , he might catch her crying and pet her a bit . " What 's the matter , little baby ? You got a fever ? You want to take the night off ? " She might murmur something then about candling eggs , but he would n't be able to understand what she meant . And after a while she cried on without knowing what she meant either , as a girl cries over a bad dream long after the dream is forgotten . In time the tears dried . She could no longer cry over anything . All the tears had been shed , all the laughs had been had ; all the love long spent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after night , under lights made soft beside music with a beat , to rise automatically when someone wearing pants pointed a finger and said " that one there . " Then just like an animal trained to sit up at sound of a little bell she found her way to the bed assigned her . Where lay all she had claim to in the world : a towel , a tube of jelly , an enamel basin , a bar of Lifebuoy and a bottle of coke , half to be spilled in the basin and the other half for a douche . Her ears heard the pants inquire her name , and her answer to that too was assigned . ( " This week you 're Pepper , little baby . " If you let her pick her own she 'd come up with something like Jane or Mary . ) So she fixed her mouth to smile in reply , washed him inp198water a little warm , lay down and shut her eyes ; felt his hands roll her breasts and a long weight upon her , turned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerk of his backside and opened her eyes : time was up again , time to begin again . By the time she returned to the light made soft beside the music that had a beat , another finger would be pointing " That one there . " " Now you finally got her where you can trust her , " was Finnerty 's view . " So long as she wants to pick her own name you still ai nt got good conditions . " Until a girl had relinquished every claim but those to basin , bed and towel , you could n't trust her . You could n't trust her until she had forgotten it was money she was working for . It took a man years of dedication to bring a girl to that . Only when he had madams sending him cash  --  no money orders  --  from half a dozen parts of the country might it be truly said of a man that he was a good pimp . Finnerty 's talent lay in his limitless contempt for all things female . He treated women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to act mindlessly . At the moment he actually had two hooked on the chicken farm story working under the same roof , and both well on their way to becoming " that one there . " Frenchy and Reba worked side by side , each satisfied that it was the other whom Oliver would betray when the Judas hour struck . Meanwhile they competed , week in and week out , to show Oliver his faith was n't misplaced . If one week Reba was top broad , Frenchy was moping all the next , feeling so useless and so untrue that Oliver had to buck her up a bit  --  " Do n't feel so bad , honey , you done your best . That week she had was just lucky breaks . You got the looks all over her , you know that . I 'm laying the odds on you this week . " Inspired by the knowledge that her owner was still betting on her , Frenchy went all out , getting tricks to finish their business almost before they had their pants down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clucking at them like an enraged hen if they did n't hurry and  --  lo ! At the end of that week she had made half again Reba 's take . " I never been so proud of anyone in my life , " Oliver congratulatedher that Saturday in front of everyone . " Do n't bother me , you , " he turned on Reba  --  " buy your own drinks , bum . " But bought Frenchy drinks all night , paraded her about , asked her what she wanted for her birthday , where she wanted to go New Year 's Night ( this was July ) and told her the chicken farm was now actually within reach . " Only two more weeks like this one , little baby , and we got it made for life . " But for the next two weeks Reba topped the whole house , they had to hold her back from pulling tricks in off the street  --  and so it went , week in , week out , playing the one against the other till it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finnerty 's top broad now . A joke which only the two butts failed to understand . " You must despise women something terrible , " Mama once grew bold enough to challenge him . " I believe , whatever you are , be a stompdown good one , " was all Finnerty replied . And no one could deny that , at his trade , Oliver was anything but a stompdown good one . In fact , he was a perfect little dilly . For he never came on cheap and loud , such as " Meet the Stinger from St. Louis , have a piece of skin . Got six broads in Miami , six in Kansas City , " and all of that . Yet why should any right-minded girl ruin her health just to keep some unfinished product in sideburns looking sharp ? What right-minded girl could let any forenoon lush bounce himself off her fine pink hide to wear off his hangover before going home to his wife , in order that some Finnerty could bet the daily double ? Why wind up , scarred from ankles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was something Mama pretended not to understand , butp200understood better than she let on . The fact was that an unprotectedgirl got into all manner of mischief , such as getting drunk on the job and ripping off her joint togs and trying to catch a Greyhound for home . It took a good pimp to keep a girl honest , Mama knew . Mama Lucille abhorred violence ; yet hardly a week passed but she was forced to say , " Honey , do n't make me get Finnertyhere with his mittens . " Yet when he put his mittens on , Finnerty always said , " Baby , this is going to be a wonderful lesson to you . Some day you 'll thank me for it . " More than one innocent , deciding she 'd rather keep her earnings than give them away , would shake some half-breed ponce in Omaha and go into business for herself in New 0 - leans . But sooner or later , wherever she rented , rooming house or hotel , desk clerk or landlady would make certain arrangements with or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , " Honey , I 'd like you to meet a nephew of mine in the sporting goods line . He 's a sweet boy , goodlookingand lots of fun , just in New Orleans for a weekend . Would you let him show you a good time ? " Desk clerks did n't bother with that . There was a knock and there he was , checkered vest and one hand in his belt . " I 'm not hard to get along with , " he 'd assure her after he told her the score . " Whether you want to come along easy or come along hard , that 's just up to you , baby . I 've got us a nice little flat above a bar in the class part of town . There 's a smart girl . " Mama boarded only one girl who had never been pandered and never would be . Hallie Breedlove had found her way to Perdido Street when small-town gossip had gone around that a certain schoolteacher was n't really white . Hallie had succeeded in passing as white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not have married her had he had the faintest doubt of it . When the gossip had forced them to move to New Orleans , she had kept him believing it was no more than gossip . Then their baby was born and the secret was out . She had not seen him since . She held herself higher , and took greater care of her health and earned more money , than any of the other women . If any of them actually wound up with a chicken farm , it would be Hallie . Yet when Finnerty propositioned her , he made no allowancesfor the fact that he was n't , for once , talking to a dementedchild . He went at her exactly as though she were as mindless as the others . " Why , that sounds almost too good to be true , Little Daddy , " Hallie tried not to appear too excited at his offer . " Only I 'm mad  --  " she stood half a head higher than him , but she baby-pouted . " Mad at your Little Daddy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Because you promised Reba she 'd never have to pull feathers and you promised Frenchy all she 'd have to do was candle  --  but me you got stepping over droppings , carrying feed and slapping new coops together . Little Daddy , it just do n't seem fair . " " Them two fools , " Finnerty scoffed merrily , " you do n't think I 'd let a couple city clowns like them on my chicken farm , do you ? You and I know what hard work is , we know what chicken farming is . Now would n't I look good trying to tell a smart country girl like yourself that all she had to do is candle ? That 's why with you I 'm sincere . A country girl and a country boy . We know you do n't get nowheres withouthard work . Do n't we , little baby ? " " What country exactly is that , Little Daddy ? " Not until then did Finnerty see he 'd been had . " Go on turning tricks till you 're sixty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come running to me for help , that 's all . " " I did n't say I would n't . " Hallie kept a baitless string bobbing . Yet when Frenchy would shake her head and say sadly , " Reba , poor thing . I really do n't dislike her , I just feel so sorry for her , the fool Oliver is making of her , " Hallie would be noncommittal . For Reba was equally concerned about poor Frenchy , and worried what would happen to the girl when she and Oliver left for the farm . Hallie pitied both , and Floralee as well , and nearly everyone . Everyone , that is , but Oliver Finnerty . There was no place in her heart , inside or out , that did not freeze over at sigl-.t of him gnawing his little nail . And while Finnerty could respecther lack of interest in his farm , he could never forgive her indifference to his physical charms . He was hurt . " The broad carries herself mighty high for one I got reason to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doors of a white house . " He had tried and she had mocked him . There was only one answer now : force . So he caught her alone petting her lame cat , the very one that had crippled his mouse , and came right to the point : " Baby , you got all that education working for you , let 's see you walk to that bureau drawer , take out every penny and come back here and hand it to mc . If you hold out so much as a nickel it 's as bad as trying to hold out the whole roll and that 's plain stealing . Move , you . " Hallie stopped petting the cat long enough to give the pander a gray , grave look . Then bundling the cat comfortably in the crook of her arm so as not to jog it , went to the bureau and put her back solidly up against it . In the bathrobe once red now faded to rose , her hand dropped casually to her pocket . Finnerty closed the door behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not without help , little baby , " he warned her . " I do n't plan to cut you , " Hallie told him quietly . " I got cut once myself . I wo n't scratch you because I do n't like to see a man walking around with scratches on his face . I wo n't throw acid in your eyes because it makes me sorry to see a blind person . All I 'll do is kill you where you stand . If you get through the door I 'll kill you on the stair . If you make the stair I 'll kill you in the parlor . If you make the street I 'll kill you on the curb . I 'll kill you in the alley . I 'll kill you in God 's I-Iouse . I 'll kill you anywhere . " Finnerty stood with his head slightly bent , his brow lined by doubt . " Did you lose something , Oliver ? " " My key , " he told her , " I lost my key . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your key . " " It 's laying in your cuff . You got a hole in your pocket . Bring your pants up later and I 'll make you a new pocket . " Had he actually appeared with the pants she would have sewed both pockets to the seat , but he gave her no such chance . It was Mama upon whom he conferred that opportunity , Hallie was later mildly surprised to discover . There she was , the bespectacled mulatto housekeeper-informer with gray in her poll , a rosary around her throat and Finnerty 's boy-size trousers across her knees , plying needle and thread as though she were his mother . " I 'm putting in a new pocket for Oliver , " she explained , chattering on as the needle plied . " Oh , I know people say a pimp is the most pitiful shame , but little they know what such a man has to go through for his hustler 's sake . What if she 's sick or in jail ? Who else has the poor thing to stand by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than we invented ours . I never heard of a pimp being elected mayor nor evenp204of one who bothered to vote , so why blame them for the way things are ? They were n't the ones who made the laws that let the trade go on . If nobody wanted there to be pimps , honey , there would n't be no pimps . Is n't it strange that it 's the very ones who say we 're a public disgrace who pay us best ? You know yourself that it 's the ones from the Departmentwho come down early on Saturdays to holler , Bring us two women and a bottle ! ' " " What 's wrong about two women and a bottle ? " Hallie asked , just to find out . " Honey , there 's nothing wrong with two women and a bottle , or three or four women and a whole case , so long as you do n't sneak it and preach against it the next day . " Mama wetted the thread and pointed it through the needle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try it , and make quite a success . " Sometimes Hallie wondered a bit about Mama . For how disapproving Mama looked later , in the kitchen , while Reba and Finnerty were having a bite together . , " Are you having coffee , baby ? " she heard Finnerty invite Reba . " Yes , daddy . " " Then make enough for two and bring mine here . " " Alright , daddy , " Old Faithful agreed , " but butter me a little piece bread . After all , I work for you . " Reba had been brought up in a Chicago orphanage although both her parents were living . They had taken turns visiting her on alternate Sundays  --  but one Sunday neither had come . " See , " one of the other girls had told her then , " your father 's no good , "  --  and had shoved Reba 's head against a flathead nail . The accident had caused a permanent squint in the girl 's right eye . Now she had found a sort of father , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least he came to visit her every day andp205sometimes twice . It was " my Oliver this , my Oliver that " and " My Oliver is just so tickled with them raw silk lounging pajamas I bought him he been lounging two whole days so I 'm going to get him cowboy boots to go with them . Wo n't that be cute ? " " Not the way I heard it it ai nt cute , " the big girl from Fort Worth needled her . " How I heard it , you 've been hiding them pants to keep him from loading up a sheeny wagon of green bananas and making hisself a nice profit by the time he got to Chicago . " " If my Oliver ever worked a sheeny wagon I 'll kiss your ass before God ! " Reba came swiftly to the defense of her household honor . " His whole life he ai nt worked one single mothering day ! Never rolled up his sleeves except to exercise horses a little . Even then he was just settin ' up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wo n't even take off his own shoes to climb in bed ! " That nothing could lower human dignity faster than manual labor was understood . " Go get yourself a lunch bucket and get back in your ditch " was the ultimate insult on Perdido Street . " Any pimp whose broad do n't take off his shoes for him , " Finnerty backed up Reba , " I defy him to claim he got good conditions . " " Oh , who cares what conditions you and your old lady got ? " the Fort Worth blonde dismissed them both . " Why , I got a daddy friend do n't take a dime off me . He buys me things . He 's going to buy me a Cadillac so long I 'll have to back up to turn a corner . Whatever Fort Worth 's real name was , no one ever called her anything but Five , to honor a navel formed to that figure . When asked to show her wonderfulnavel she would show it , sweetly and simply , just like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold herself proudly just because of that . No chicken farm story was likely to catch Five . She hadp206been brought up on one , and had had enough of that . Yet she was wide open to the Cadillac story , which was nothing more than the chicken farm story on wheels . Oh , that long easy rider with the real careful driver . When promises would buy Cadillacs , Five would own a whole fleet . Until that time Five would go on her feet . The courts were against them , the police were against them , businessmen , wives , churches , press , politicians and their own panders were against these cork-heeled puppets . Now the missions were sending out sandwich men to advertisethat Christ Himself was against them . " If it were n't for Mama who 'd take our side , " Frenchy demanded to know , and stick up for them Mama did . She took their side against Oliver , ordered him out of her house , and told him not to come back till he could show respect to ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least once a week . A cruel game , tricking children . For one word from Finnertywould be enough to send the woman back to the alley stalls from which she 'd risen . Colored women were not legally permitted to manage houses employing white prostitutes . But every house was required to keep a maid on the premises duringworking hours . To the police therefore Mama was a maid . This was Finnerty 's arrangement , and he did n't let her forget it for a day . Leaving Mama troubled by the part she played . At times she tried to justify herself by remembering that she had been deceived by many white men ; therefore it was only fair that she should now deceive their daughters . Yet disappointment wide as the world would surprise her out of her sleep : " When had she ceased to belong to herself ? " Some mornings she would have to go for the cognac before she could go downstairsand say , " How is my chick today ? " to each and every one.  |p207Between  forenoon and evening her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . Hallie came down first , with a cup of tea steaming in her hand and the brindle cat limping at her side . It was a cat that took offense at nothing simply to have some sort of life . It walked beside her down the stone , but when it felt dew beneathits paws it drew back . Then Hallie would point her foot , the cat would leap , hobble and claw its way clear to her shoulder . Then they went together to say good morning to the jonquils growing between the cobbles . Though between the cobbles of Hallie 's heart no jonquil would grow again . A heart like a lonesome gravestone , winter weeds covered it now . Below the weeds the child lay buried who had been but three when he 'd died . One who had surprised his mother that sad and sudden fall by asking " Mother , are my mittens ready for winter ? Are my earlaps ready ? Will my coat be warm ? " His last Christmas he had put a hand behind a glowing ornament , passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until she had made him stop . Now nine shuttered Christmases later she walked powdered , Maybellined and gowned in the mascaraed evening light and something swollen in a mushroom 's shape , boredom like a living growth , bore down on her heart and brain . Morning was not the hardest time , for the lame cat needed her , and the other women were not yet about to smile a little to themselves when they talked to her : " How you ( loin ' , philosopher ? " they would ask , though she could not recall who , nor why , anyone had first called her that . But she had once been a country schoolteacher , so it must have something to do with that . " I got no philosophy but I topped you last night , " Frenchy especially liked to tease her . So she and the cat went visiting jonquils , and had a bit ofp208fur-to-ear chatter in the ancestral understanding of woman and cat . Sometimes she read , in the quiet forenoon , out of books she still loved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched on the window ledge through the sweltering afternoon , then she was left alone in this strange house , and ennui came down like a foe on her mind and she shaded her eyes with her hand . To hope she might spend her yet unspent hours bedside to bed in some common ward , under some final quarantine , some ward where go all those whose lives are untouchable , from streets for whom nobody prays . Where it is one where eveningfalls and one the sad return of day . Till the violet evening had mercy at last . Then she stood in the portiere and chose what guests she would . The other women regarded her with a strange mixture of admiration and pity . They felt she held herself apart because she had once taught school  --  yet at other times they perceived she was somehow defenseless against all of them . Then it was that , hearing the low grinding of metal on stone , they looked the other way to spare her , while Finnerty held the big doors wide . They did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a bit , that at the sound of little wheels , life was beginning again in Hallie . Her lover was the legless man . " I 'm a philosopher , too , " Reba challenged Hallie  --  " because I got my own goddamn philosophy . For instance . You take a woman married to a good man and she cheats on him . Their baby is born dead . Well she had it coming to her , did n't she ? Everyone gets what 's coming to them , that 's my philosophy . I picked it up working for loryers . They said they never heard anything like it . " " I can believe that , " Hallie was inclined to agree with loryers.  | " I had to run down two flights and up one across the street to get a coke , " Reba recalled , " because across the street is a whorehouse with a coke machine . Why wear myself out running stairways ? A job is a job . One with cokes is better . That 's my philosophy too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're on hard liquor . Okay , be a B-broad and get drunk every night . Say you 're a heavy eater , a regular fat glutton , get a job as a waitress ' n stuff yourself . Say you 're rapping doors with a box of silk stockingsunder your arm and you start freezing . So what ? Get a job as a dance-hostess and work up a sweat . " I got half my choppers out and no ovalries . So what ? I can still be a practical nurse , ca n't I ? My people come from that part of Europe where they say fis ' for fish . ' I do n't know where it 's at exactly but when my mother sent me to the store she 'd always say Honey , bring back a nice piece fis . ' Hey ! How 'd you like all the cigarettes you could smoke ? Just go down to American Tobacco and give my name , they 'll give you all you can haul in one trip . " " Baby , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but I never heard nothing like it neither . " Reba read all the papers , and always shook her head when she 'd finished one . Someone in South Carolina had received two boxes of poisoned candy by mail , signed merely " B'rer Rabbit , RF.D . " Now what did anyone hope to get out of poisoning somebody else by mail ? " If you got a grudge like that hire somebody to bust his damn legs , do n't go sneaking around signing yourself a damn rabbit . " Postal delivery poisoners were among the few who fell out of the range of her sympathy . It troubled her to read that a tenant farmer had drowned his three daughters in a well because " Jesus says we got to go . " " If Jesus said that why do n't he jump in the well hisself and let Jesus decide for the babies ? " Nor was she satisfied with the explanation of the brakeman who killed his wife with a hammer . " Grace ai nt fitten to raisep210a dog . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't know what people are coming to , they act like a bunch of damned pistols , " was Reba 's reaction . When she read of a widow woman who fell and broke her leg on a downtown street and someone stole forty-eight dollars out of her purse while she lay helpless , Reba was helpless too . " That 's too much " was all she had to say for that day , and threw the paper away . One evening an actor stumbled in . " I 've had too much to drink , " he told the women as though otherwise they 'd never catch on . " Sweetie , I seen your picture in the paper but why do n't you just go home ? " Reba asked . The next morning the actor had his picture in the paper again , having been picked up for drunk and disorderly down the street . " I had too much t. , drink " he had repeated his explanation to reporters once more . Reba 's patience gave out . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to drink . ' What did I tell him when he was here ? Sweetie , you 've had too much to drink ' is just what I told him . Honest to God , when a man knows he 's had too much and goes on drinking more all the same , that 's just too much . I refuse to adjust to peasants of a environment like this , that 's all . " The excuse of the dunce who drowned his infant daughter because his wife had run off with another man did n't get him off the hook with Reba . " Something snapped in my head " he had told the police , " I did n't know what I was doing . " " I had too much to drink , ' " she mocked all erring mankind . " Something snapped in my head , ' I did n't know what I was doing '  --  of all the bum excuses . Give me animals , at least they know what they 're doing . " Especially elephants . Elephants always knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how they come on ? " she asked anxiously of some sport adjusting a black wool tie inp211a cracked mirror while she was preoccupied with the ritual of the douche , shaking the bottle madly to make it foam . " If you 'd stop sizzling maybe I could hear what you 're saying , " the wool-tie sport suggested . " Well , " the girl explained , " I read about how the old man elephant whips up a big pit in the ground with his trunk ' n then whips the old lady into it . Otherwise they could never make it and there would n't be no elephants . " " So what ? " " Well , it just goes to show you , animals do know what they 're doing . " " I 'm in theatrical work , " the girl called Frenchy explained to a date . " See  --  " she stretched her pale hands before his eyes  --  " I 'm double-jointed too . Double-jointed hips , but I lost my partner . " " Ca n't you find another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . I probably could n't find another partner in the entire country . Not everyone 's double-jointed you know . " She was a high-cheekboned girl with consumptive coloring . " We 'd swing down the coast and come back west  --  Philly , Cleveland , Cincinatti , Chattanooga  --  that 's where my folks are , they spent thousands on my education . " Out on the walk , up and down in the rain , the man with a cap that shaded his eyes carried a sign that said BEWARE THEWRATH TO COME . If the pale lost blonde was n't down the stairs by the time that street lamps came on , somebody went up and fetched her down . Should lamps be lit or no lamp burn , all was one to the pale lost blonde . Nobody had counted , for nobody cared , how many lamps had come up and gone down since the night she had stood where Loew 's marquee lights flickered in an uncertain rain , when a cabbie had held a door wide for her and she 'd toldp212him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lake Pontchartrain . " Nobody was home at Lake Pontchartrain . She had spoken a name overheard , nothing more , and offered him a pressed flower out of her purse for her fare . He preferred coming into the back seat with her to collect instead . Then had turned her over to Finnerty to satisfy the meter . " I 'd rather not be whupped , " she 'd told Oliver  --  " if I got my rathers . " " I 'd rather not whup you , " Finnerty reasoned with her , " all I 'm asking is that you let me take care of you in the big things so that you can take care of me in the little ones . Or am I asking too much ? " " Little ones , big ones , " the girl repeated , offering him a smile itself a pressed flower . " Do you remember your name , little baby ? " he asked her . " Floralee "  --  and that was all she remembered . First he had made her his pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ease with which he 'd accomplished this troubled him . He had Mama spy on her . Mama reported back . " Have n't you any pride at all ? " he asked Floralee in his injured tone , " coming on with a trick like it was love , love , love ? Do you realize you spent the better part of an hour with that burn for a lousy four dollars ? " " Daddy , I lost track of the time , " the demented girl replied . " I 'm here to take care of your needs , " he reminded her . " Try to remember that . " But a few days later he heard a great thump and crash overheadwhile she was entertaining . " What was that ? " he asked her half an hour after . " Why , daddy , we fell off the bed and kept right on going , that was all , " she told him so innocently he hardly had the heart to give her the beating she now so richly deserved . But it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hung his coat over the back of a chair.  | " If you 'd just as soon , " she had seen what was coming , " I 'd as soon not be whupped  --  if I got my sooners . " " I 'd sooner not , " Oliver told her , but put on his mittens , lifted her pony-tail off the back of her head to get at the nape where bruises do n't show : A few rabbit-punches , enough to make her head spin , and that satisfied him . " But next time when you chippy with a date daddy wo n't put his mittens on , " he promised her . She never committed the sin of chippying again . Although Oliver 's other two faithfuls , Reba and Frenchy , were at needle 's points day and night , somehow neither was jealous of the wandering blonde . " Nobody home at Lake Pontchartrain is right , " was all Frenchy had to remark . For Floralee 's life was too remote for envy . She lived enwrapped in some private cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dimly and sometimes bright ; but never like the light of the world in which the other women lived and bargained . The girl had days when she seemed so sensible no one could have guessed there was anything amiss . But before night she would be ecstatic , singing upstairs or downThe beasts of the wild Will be led by a childAnd I 'll be changed from the thing I amAnd the next morning would be utterly cast down . Once Oliver went to fetch her and found her lying naked on her side , eyes shut tight , knees drawn to her chin and the sheet over her head . There was no sound in the hot little room save the incessant hum of an electric fan . " There are little people a-prayin ' and a-singin ' in there , " she told him and he understood she was hearing the voices of her people at their old spirituals in the hypnotic hum of thep214fan . He shut it off , returned with a small radio and tuned in a Sunday morning choirThe son of God goes forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streams afar , Who follows in His train ? Floralee opened her eyes to see her little daddy standing on a chair , pretending to lead a congregationWho best can drink his cup of woe triumphant over pain ? "  --  it takes your little daddy to get them real good programs , " he told her , and jumped down . She listened closer , growing proud of the way her little daddy made them real good programscome in . By noon she was downstairs singing with faith restoredHis blood-red banner streams afar " That just wo n't get it , honey , " Mama finally had to put a stop to it  --  " I 'm a church-going woman bound to die blessed , but there 's a time and a place for everything and that song just is n't right for a place like this . If you just have to sing when men are around , try something like Mademoiselle from Armentieres '  --  something to put them in the mood , not take them out of it . " " I wo n't sing brashy tunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I sung one once ' n that same night God said He could n't bear me . " " God would n't say a thing like that , sweetheart , " Mama promised . " He said it all the same . He was standing right outside my door , I heard him plain as day . Ile said , I 've took all I can off that girl . I ca n't bear the sight of her . ' " " What makes you think God would talk like that , sweet-heart ? " Floralee 's face clouded as she struggled to remember , thenp215her eyes cleared . " Because , whoever He was talking to , IIe kept saying No . By no means . No.No.No . ' That must have been God . If it had been the devil he would have been saying Yes , oh , yes , by all means , by all means and do n't think I do n't appreciate it . " And in her anxiety that God bear her , applied to Him right there and then despite Mama 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach that shining strand ? The only solution was to play the juke with the volume turned up . " To hear that looney holler , " Reba shuddered after things had quieted down a bit , " you 'd think all they did in them hills was bury their dead . " " Let us not begrudge the child , " Mama reproved Reba , " she got the innocence God protects . " While God protected her innocence , Finnerty figured her finances . He supplied her clothes , her meals , her amusements and what in all seriousness he called her education . The grift on joint-togs , such as parade panties , ran to a hundred percent and higher . Small wonder He had forgotten entirely about the escapee from 0-Daddyland . The escapee came down Perdido Street with a sample case in his hand . He was n't offering coffee pots nor finger waves any more . Now He was the Watkins Man . Of course being a Watkins Man in 1931 was n't what it had been before the wilderness had been pushed back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking orders for . lotions and salves . The Watkins Man had once been the bringer of news of the world outside to the Louisiana backbrush ; and he 'd been more than a news bearer . lie could tell the farmer what ailed his horse and could cure the brute asp216well . More than a horse doctor , he had cured people too . He could preach the Word , act as midwife , and recite Evangeline . In Dove Linkhorn , unhappily , these arts had declined . Indeed , they had vanished altogether . And by his clothes one had to wonder whether this particular Watkins Man might not even have the notion that his true trade was lovemaking rather than salesmanship . Dove had spent every last cent of his 0-Daddy gold on a suit of O-Daddy clothes . It was tropical white , over a shirt with narrow pink stripes . His hat had a yellow feather that matched his shoes of yellow suede . He had come a long way , that was plain to be seen , from the boy who had come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street for whom nobody prays , in the evening hour . It was that slander-colored evening hour before the true traffic begins , when once again sheets have been changed , again Lifebuoy and permanganate have been rationed ; and once again for blocks about , pouting or powdering or dusting their navels , each girl wonders idly what manner of man  --  mutt , mouse , or moose  --  the oncoming night will bring her . Perdido Street , in the steaming heat , felt like a basement valet shop with both irons working . The girls in the crib doors plucked at their blouses to peel them off their breasts . In the round of their arm pits sweat crept in the down . Sweat molded their pajamas to their thighs . The whole street felt molded , pit to thigh . It was even too hot to solicit . For normal men do n't so much as glance at the girls in heat like that lest the watery navels stick . Yet the very heat that enervates men infects women with restlessness and the city was full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeking to lose their loneliness without sacrificing their solitude . Dull boys whose whole joy expired in one piggish grunt . Anything could happenp217to a woman available to anyone . Boredom of their beds and terror of their street divided each . They had died of uselessness one by one , yet lived on behindveritable prairie fires of wishes , hoping for something to happen that had never happened before : the siren screaming toward the crossing smashup , the gasp of the man with the knife in his side , the suicide leap for no reason at all . Yet behindsuch fires sat working cross words while prying saltwatertaffy from between their teeth : passion and boredom divided each . In Spider-Boy Court the blinds , drawn low , left the room in a dappled gloom where dimly fell the shadows , darker yet , of bars . For little windows lined the side that paralleled PerdidoStreet . And a ceiling fan , cutting the restless light , caused shadows to tremble along wall and floor . In this moted dusk a juke played on and so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music stopped , a creaking , regular and slow , began right overhead and they began shifting uneasily from divan to doorway and back to the divans , opening another coke or lighting a fresh cigarette at each new post  --  they never finished anything . Dissatisfaction was a disease with them . Reba was sure the fan was giving her a chill , Floralee needed something to warm her up , Frenchy wanted someone to tell her why she could n't spike a coke with gin and Kitty said she was simply suffocating . Wherever they powdered , wherever they paced , envy and ennui divided each . " A light drizzle would be good for trade , " Mama took a guess , " but a heavy fall would ruin it . " At that moment a cab honked from the curb . Though someone was always watching the street , no one had seen it drive up . A cab that appeared out of nowhere , like a cab in a misting dream . Mama simply scuttled to the curbp218and the girls crowded forward in their watery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step forth in the greenish light a naval lieutenant in full regalia , a sea-going executive in rimless glasses , a hero of sea fights yet unfought . Bearing like a rainbow across his sky-blue breast all the ribboned honors a peacetime navy could pin . From the gold-braided cap to the gold-braid sleeves , there were not many such sights above deck in 1931 . Mama had never captured a sight so glorious just to behold . Yet the sight seemed reluctant of capture . He held Mama in some earnest discussion speaking low to keep his driver from hearing . " Mammy-freak , " Mama thought she heard him say , " stick out so fah behind she handly got time make a child behave . " Mama stepped closer . " I do n't quite catch what you 're saying , officer . " He leaned toward her cupping his lips  --  " Made a lemon pie . Me a little pie . What do you know ? A littlelemon pie all my own . " Mama took one step back . " Lemon ? All your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churn . " " Then I have just the girl for you , " Mama decided . For whatever the rascal had in mind she could n't afford to lose any prospect so prosperous . " Every man likes a little change now and then . I know exactly how you feel . " He drew himself up . " Nobody knows how a mammy-freak feels , " he informed her point blank . " How could anyone but another mammy-freak know how a mammy-freak feels ? " If it was an organization he was the president . Mama simplyturned to go but he held her back with a wheedling touch . " You know yourself , " he cajoled her , " how they stick out in back . " " Who stick out in back ? " " Why , all of them , when they get in a hurry . Now admit it . " Mama shook off his hand . " Who stick out ? Who get in ap219hurry ? Admit what ? " Mama was getting angry but she did n't know at what . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her as though everyone knew old black mammies were the coming thing . " Maybe you ought to come inside before it rains , " Mama invited him , feeling they 'd both be safer in the parlor . " It is n't going to rain , " Navy sounded certain as God , and began unfolding a little apron from under his coat . He bowed to tie it about her waist . It was striped green and white like peppermint and as he tied it Mama wondered how she had become the prospect . Her fingers plucked without strength at the apron 's price tag . He picked the tag off himself and the cab dusted off in disgust . " A good many black mammy-freaks visit you I presume ? " he presumed confidently . " It 's been several days since one called , " Mama played it straight , " and he did n't leave his name . Would you care to offer yours ? " " My men call me Commander , " he informed her stiffly . " That , " Mama thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And led him inside like leading him home . Just as the first drops began . Inside the parlor the five-year-old boy with the mind of a forty-year-old pimp , the one his grandmother called Warren Gameliel and the women called the King of the Indoor Thieves , stood on a divan ready for anything . In a shirt that never reached past his navel and a tight little hide not exactly high yellow , Warren Gameliel was actually closer to being high-brown . He was even closer to darkbrown . As a matter of fact he was black as a kettle in hell . He was so black you 'd have had to put a milk bottle on his head to find him in the dark . He looked a cross between a black angus calf and something fished out of the Mississippip220on a moonless night . One tint darker and he would have disappearedaltogether . Turning his head proudly upon his iron-colored throat , he fluttered his beautiful lashes modestly at the women 's flattery . " Meet my grandson , " Mama always introduced her menfolksfirst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year old ' n weighs sixty-nine pound ' n she asks is he fine , " the woman called Hallie Dear mocked Mama fondly as the big overdressed man saluted the small naked one . " Pledge allegiance , boy baby , " Mama encouraged Warren G. to his single legitimate accomplishment . But Warren G. just planted his black toes the wider , as if to say he 'd have to know more about this gold-braid deal before he 'd pledge so much as a teething ring . Reba honked with hollow glee : the boy was growing up so fast . " Ai nt you shamed ? " Mama reproved him in a voice that simply donged with pride . Warren Gameliel felt no shame . That belonged , Hallie Dear saw in a single shocked glance , to the hero beside her . For the ghost of a smile that strayed down his lips belonged to a beggar-ghost , a penniless pleader hunting a handout  --  then it was gone . Leaving hull cowering within himself in some cave of no knowing save his own . Hallie hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't as alone as all that , and he peered out slowly , warily . Feeling her support , he began coming out of it . Slowly , warily . " In Shicawgo I worked in a office for loryers , " Reba hurried to keep the man from confusing her with certain commonwhores trying to crowd him  --  " I specialized in tort ' n see-zure  --  " but Floralee elbowed her aside . Floralee was fond of gold braid too . " I can sing just ever so purty , mister , " she offered in a voicep221strung on little silver bells "  --  only modesty songs of course , for I do n't know vulgary words  --  " and did him as pretty a little curtsy as ever he 'd seen . Warren G. tried to regain the spotlight , but Mama yanked the cap , that he had taken off the officer 's head , far down over the boy 's eyes , as if shutting off his vision might improve his manners . Somebody got the juke going just then and someone else called for gin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as the juke beganAll of meWhy not take all of me " I can sing punier far than that , " Floralee insisted amid pleas , claims , threats and tiny squeals , for now all vied for Navy 's attention . " Why do people down here all talk so Southern ? " Chicago Kitty complained . " Why do they have to talk like the niggers ? Why ca n't they talk like their selves ? " " We do talk like ourselves , honey , " Hallie assured her , " the Negras learned to talk that way from us . " " May I recite now ? " Floralee begged . " As soon as the juke is through , sweetheart , " Mama promised , and turning to the guest , " This girl is a regular angel . " " She 's a whore like everyone else , " Kitty put in  --  " anyone can be a whore . I feel rotten about everyone but myself . " " Is that true ? " Navy asked Mama curiously . " Can any woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anyone at all , " Mama was optimistic . " Are n't we all created free and equal ? " " Tell me one thing , sailor boy , " Chicago Kitty demanded . " Where do you keep your submarines ? " " Why ask me a thing like that ? " The lieutenant looked embarrassed . " I have to know . I 'm a spy on the side . " " I do n't want anyone calling our guest sailor boy , " Mamap222scolded Kitty and everyone . " Look up to this man ! He 's honoring us ! Hear this ! Commander ! Report all insults directly to me ! Warren Gameliel you little black fool , get that fool hat off your head and pledge allegiance in-Stan-tane-ously ! " " Mama ! " Hallie scolded in turn , " stop giving orders as though we were in battle formation ! This man did n't come here to have you pin a medal on him . Ca n't you see you 're spoiling his fun ? " And brushing everyone aside , she framed his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave . " Navy , do n't mind Mama , " she told him , " she 's just impressed by your uniform . " " Do n't dare call our Guest of Honor Navy like that ! "  --  Mama was getting worse by the minute  --  " This man representsthe entire Atlantic fleet ! " " I represented two loryers , " Reba remembered wistfully . " I represent a tube of K-Y jelly ' n a leaky douche bag , " Kitty commented bitterly . " I can sing like a damned bird , " Floralee marveled aloud , " only how did I fly here ? " Outside the drunks were coming out of the country 's last speak-easies and the street lamps began to move like the breasts of a young girl under the hands of a man who has bought too many . Warren Gameliel reached out blindly and secured a black stranglehold on the officer 's neck . " If you do n't behave I 'll send you to the nigger school , " Mama threatened him . And in an odd little silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the juke box was playing , I began to cry . " And all the air felt troubled by cologne . " I think our guest wants to see me , " Hallie guessed , and pulled Navy 's head right against her breast . He nodded strengthless assent . She helped him to rise , and he rose more like a sick man than one drunk.  | " Send two double gins to my room , " Hallie ordered Mama , " the rest of you drink whatever you want . " The door shut behind them and a lamp lit a room that might have served a whore of old Babylon : a narrow bed in hope of bread , a basin in hope of purity . A beaded portiere to keep mosquitoes out and let a little music in . A scent of punk from an incense stick to burn off odors of whiskey or tobacco , a calendar from the year before and an image above it of something or other in hope of forgiveness for this or that . A whole world to millions since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lamp 's brown glow on her amber gown made of Halliea golden woman . For her eyes were gray , her skin was olive and about her throat she wore a yellow band . Her gown , unfastened at one shoulder , was kept from fallingonly by the rise of her unbound breast . Still she said , " No matter how often I trick , as soon as I 'm with a man I get shaky . " " You do n't have to bother to get shaky with me , " the seagoingexecutive assured her , " do n't even bother taking off your clothes . " So he had found some fault in her . " What 's the matter , do n't you like dark girls ? " " It 's not you , it 's me , " he reassured her , " I 'm of no use , that 's all . But I 'll gladly pay you for your time . " " I do n't need charity . " Hallie was hurt nonetheless . " It is n't charity . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bought . " " Then I 'll take the money all the same , " Hallic recovered herself and sat beside him on her dishonored bed , letting the gown drape loosely over her breast in event he should prove not so useless as he thought . " I 'm from Virginia , of course , " he announced as though that were more important than a woman 's flesh.  | " I 'm from Louisiana myself , " Hallie went along . " Of course . " " What I mean is "  --  he felt it time to be kind  --  " I 'm a gen-tleman . " " I 'm certain you are , " Hallie told him he really was . " When you 're a lady yourself that 's something you can tell about a man right off . " " What I 'm trying to say , " he tried afresh , " I 'm a Virginia gentleman . " " I do n't mean to be sarcastic , mister , " Hallie promised him , " but so what ? " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemanmight not be self-sufficing , " well , it means I can teach at Washington and Lee ! " " It 's nice to have two jobs , " Hallie was sure , " and in times like these amounts to a real curiosity . " " I 'll tell you what is a yet mightier curiosity , " he got down to business at last , " and that 's the way old black mammies stick out in back  --  " his voice took on a secret excitement " the way she come by with a broom ' n most knocks you down  --  Boy !  --  stay outa mah way when ah 'm cleanin ' , Boy '  --  ' n here she comes by again with bucket ' n mop  --  Boy , when you gon na learn to behave ? Did n't ah tell you stay outa mah way ? Boy ! '  --  ' n you just about turn around ' n here comes Mammy back again  --  Boy ! You got nawthin ' to do all day but stand in mah path ? You fixin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself only with an effort . " Mister , " Hallie asked gently , " how long you been in this condition ? " " Since the day I broke the churn of course . Black Mammy 's been dead nineteen years  --  otherwise why would I feel this way ? Hand and foot she waited on us and when that day come when all she could do was just to set in her old cane chair , there was n't a soul but myself to fetch her a glass of water.  | " Mammy , ' I told her , " you waited on me , I 'm goin ' to wait on you . I 'm takin ' care of my old black mammy . " " I slept by her chair , for she could n't lie down . When I woke at night I could reach out and touch the back of her skinny black hand and know if she was asleep or awake just by the touch . Mostly she 'd be awake . You know what I 'd ask her then ? " Hallie felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her then ? " " I 'd ask her , You want anything , Black Mammy ? ' That 's just what I 'd ask her . " " She must have been grateful for your care . " He looked at Hallie so evenly . " More than I knew . For the very day she died she raised her weary old arm and give me a back-handed slap . " " You broke another churn on her ? " " It was her way of letting me know that she had understoodall along what her first back-handed slap , when I was ten years old , had done . " " She forgive you at last for breakin ' the churn ? " Hallie kept trying . " We were too grateful to one another for forgiving , " he explained  --  " Do n't you think I know it was Black Mammy 's hand made a mammy-freak out of me ? That I might have had a wife and family now if it had n't been for her hand ? Yet I 'm grateful to her still . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm glad the porch was slippery . " Hallie was lost . " Mister , " she shook her head sadly , " I just do n't take your meaning . " " The water from the churn made the porch all wet . When its handle snapped she saw what I 'd done and aimed her hand . I slipped and fell so she paddled me face down . I lay hollering , pretending she was half killing me . Black Mammy had a good strong hand . That was the first time I was made to behave . " Hallie saw light faintly.  | " What happened exactly ? " " Why , what happens when a man is having a girl , that 's what happened . And I 've never been able to make it happen any other way since . " He laughed in the watery light yet his face looked stricken . " I 'm terribly tired , I do n't know why , " he said and put his face in his hands . It came to Hallie then that this was n't at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sort of lonely suckling boy playing Commander with his nose still running . " Mister , " she told him quietly , " you do n't need a girl . You need a doctor . " " There are n't any doctors for black-mammy freaks , " he explained dryly , as though he 'd tried looking one up in the city directory . " Then just try to rest , " Hallie told him . Fast as she could pin , Hallie was preparing Mama for the great impersonation . " You do n't think he stole his ship 's money , do you ? " Mama had to know . " Ile is n't going to get us all in trouble , is he ? " " You never made an easier dollar your whole enduring life , " Hallie reassured her , " he 's just a green boy been kept on black titty too long . All you got to remember is this rapscallion keeps getting in your way . Just do n't hit him too hard  --  just hard enough to make it look good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our armed forces , " and Mama stuck right there . " Getting whupped by his old black mammy is what he come here for  --  turn around so I can pin you . " She began stuffing a small pillow into Mama 's bosom . " The more you stick out in front the more you stick out behind . I 'll have you sticking out so far you 'll look like Madame Queen . " " Girl , I was born in this country . "  |p227It  was plain Mama had n't caught the play even yet . " Mama , " Hallie pleaded , " forget the man 's uniform . I 'm trying to tell you he is n't like other men . " Mama stiffened like a retriever . " Honey , he ai nt one of them O-verts ? "  --  She was ready to rip off her **26;9933;TOOLONG and run the whole 0-vert navy out of town " I wont cater to them . Not for no amount . " " If he were he 'd be better off , " Hallie reassured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt over skirt till Mama , weighted down , sank heavily into a chair . " Honey , I 'm starting to sweat , " she complained . " Sweat till you shine , " Hallie encouraged her , " but do n't show your face 611 1 give you the sign . " And stepped through the portiere . Beneath the ruin of the gold-braid hat the King of the Indoor Thieves had collapsed at last , his undershirt tangled about his throat as if someone had tried to improve his mannersby finishing him off altogether . He snored till his toes were spread , he stretched till he creaked in dreams of some final assault for an earth about to be his for keeps , " All of you stop talking out of the corners of your mouth like you were Edgar G. Robinson and everybody was in the can , " Hallie quieted the woman  --  " You 've got a guest tonight that means gold from way back , so try to show manners . " For down the stair with an admiral 's tread came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the dogs had had him under the house ; with a gin glass latched to his hand . Hallie crooked one finger toward the portiere . Mama came forth with forehead shining , bandanna and broom , all sweat and Aunt Jemima , in the peppermint apron that hung like candy . The second he saw her Navy dropped his glass . " I did n't mean to do that , " he apologized immediately , and began trying to clean the floor with his sleeve , glass , splinters , and all , making a worse mess than before.  | ( Long-ago Mammy who made me behave the day the big churn broke , who backhanded me to pretend she did n't know something had broken forever . Who knew how it was going to be with me , and made me a little pie all my own . Who 's left to make me behave ? ) Mama seated herself across from him , in all her preposterous gear . Hallie put a warning finger to her lips . The girls exchangedlooks part fear and part wonder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descent , " Mama felt it was time to explain the curious no-man 's land of her faith , " I 've shod the horse all around . " Meaning she had had four husbands . " So I 'm not acceptable to the Church . But if I ca n't die sanctified I hope to die blessed . " His elbow touched Floralee 's glass . It tottered , he reached as if to keep it from tipping and knocked it over , of course , instead . The girl pushed back her chair and he began mopping it up with a silk handkerchief , although all he was doing actuallywas swishing the handkerchief around in it . " Go on with your story , " he told Mama , " I 'm sorry to be so clumsy . " Mama had lost the thread . All she could remember was that she had four husbands . " Three of them were thieves and one was a legit man  --  I 'd never marry another legit man . Did you know that a prize fighter is more gentle than other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows what a man 's fists can do . Do you know11 that you 're safer living with a man who kills for hire than with a man who has never killed ? That 's because one knows what killing is . The other do n't . " " Why , " Navy remarked , " in that case ill-fame women ought to make better wives than legitimate girls . " Again that odd little silence fell . Nobody knew what to say to that . " Navy , I think that 's the nicest thing I 've heard anyonep229say since I 've been in the trade , " Hallie said  --  and his elbow tipped Mama 's glass into her lap . " Now do n't tell me that just happen , ' " Mama scolded in real earnest now  --  " Do n't tell me any man is that clumsy . Mister , my frank opinion is you done that a-purpose . " " Honest , I did n't , Mammy , " he lied patiently . " Do n't whup him , Mama , " Floralee pleaded for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , " Hallie defended him too . " Give me one more chance , Mama , " he whimpered . " Only out of respect for your uniform , " Mama issued finalwarning , " and one more is all you gets . " She turned to shakeout her skirts , somebody tittered and somebody honked andshe whirled just in time to catch him with two fingers to hisnose . Now Mama scarcely knew what to feel . " Why , that is n't the least bit nice , a man of your backgroundto have such manners  --  " " He did n't mean anything , Mama , " Hallie was sure . " Do n't whup him , " Floralee begged . " Cross my heart I did n't mean anything , " Navy swore in that same unbearable small-boy whine that in itself entitled him to a thrashing. " 0 he meant it all right , " Kitty informed , " I saw him with my naked eye  --  and I have a very naked eye . " " I will try to do better , please mum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to behave and be a good boy  --  " and standing to cross his promise , yanked tablecloth , bottle , glasses , trays , cokes , decanters and four bottles of beer crashing to the floor. " 0 you fool 's fool , " now Mama roared right at him , black with rage as he turned white with fright , neither pretending in the least  --  right under the table the two-hundred pound hero ducked . And cowering there all could hear him plea  --  " Do n't whup me , mama , please do n't whup me . " Unable to reach him with her fist , Mama seized his black silk ankles and hauled him forth floundering on his back , hisp230eyes closed and covered by his arm to ward off anticipated blows . " I do n't like the looks of this , " Mama told Hallie , " he ai nt got no right to be so loose without being drunk or sick , neither . " " He 's sick enough for twenty , " Hallie informed her . " Somebody get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Floralee inquired , and emptied a full pitcher right in his face . Then , looking into her pitcher , grew sad . " Why , it 's empty , fun 's all done . " She looked ready to cry . " Use cokes , " Hallie ordered . Now who but Hallie could have thought of that ? Floralee leaped for the half-finished bottles standing like small sentrieson ledge and divan , and in no time at all had her pitcher full again . This time she poured it down the front of his shirt . " That was fun , " she told Hallie then . " The fun is done , " Hallie told her . " Fun done , " the girl accepted matters . But on the floor the fun had only begun . There he lay licking his big : ox-tongue , a coke-licking Lazarus too languid to rise . " I 've been everywhere God got land , " Mama announced , " but this is the most disgusting sight yet seen . " " You can drop his legs now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ankles , that dropped like a dead man 's legs . Both women stood looking down . Hallie herself did n't know what to do with the fellow . As Navy finally opened his eyes . His eyes so blue , so commanding . " That was the nicest party I 've had in twelve years , " he congratulated everyone . Mama lowered herself in all her finery , onto a divan and sighed , just sighed  | " Bring me the evening paper , " she asked after a while , " I want to see what the white folks are up to . " The figure , the face and the gleaming braid of the madman who had spent a month 's pay in a night dimmed swiftly . His money long spent , nobody cared what had become of the Lieutenant-in-Command . " I wonder , " Mama grew suspicious later , " whether that officer told us the entire truth . " " So far as he knew it , " Hallie took a guess . " You figure he left out a little something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple as he likes to think . I think she had lapped the field . " " I do n't follow your meaning . " " Why , I think from the day she paddled that little boy , she knew what kind of material she was working with . I think whether that little boy became a man or stayed a little boy was entirely up to her . She had a choice between herself and the boy , and she chose against the boy . That was the only way she had of not one day losing him to a white girl . " " I 'd purely hate to believe that a common field darky could be that evil , " Mama turned Hallie 's theory down cold . " She was n't a field darky . She was a house darky with scores to settle in that same house . Everything she had the white folks had taken . She saw her chance to get something back . I 'll take my oath she was getting even on somebody . " " No , " Mama still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that woman was n't give nobody but a little white boy to love , and he was n't give nobody but an old black mammy . When things are like that color and age even do n't matter . In love , not even price matter . Yes , Black Mammy genuinely love that child . " " It 's what I 've been trying to tell you all along , " Hallie agreed . " In love price do n't matter nor which lover pays.  |p232It  's why he ca n't hate her even to this day though he knows now what she did to him . " Though the languid lieutenant was far to sea  --  gone withouttrace never to return , his visits began a slow sea change . He had spent so freely Finnerty had been encouraged to believethere must be other such fools about , in uniform or out . Finnerty was right . " It 's the age of specialization is what it is , " he began preachinga new faith , " Do you go to a eye doe to get a tooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for stamps ? New fields is opening and one is the bug field . Hundreds of bugs loaded with gold , the depression ai nt even touched them , willingto pay somebody to make them happy . It do n't make a bug happy to come into a joint , point out a girl and go to bed . Nowadays he wants the bit spiced up . He wants the girl to tell him , Do what you want with me . ' " Perhaps too it was Finnerty 's new girl , a spare and bitter child just out of a Houston jail who had encouraged him , for she seemed not to care in the least what became of her . " My name is Kitty Twist , " she had told him , " and I do every-thing . " Her breastless , sexless personality was no matter , Finnerty knew . For this was the kind of girl upon whom a man might recover something of which a wife or mistress had robbed him . The city was full of hatless Ilarrys seeking not so much love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposedby women : wife , nurse , sister , daughter , mistress or aunt . ' Woman , there was the cause of it all . A traffic founded on self-pity that paid off better than the old-fashioned traffic in love . Love 's dividends came in single bills ; but hatred 's comes by twenties . " It 's the new way of doing things , " Finnerty approved . And the men who came buzzing in the lieutenant 's wakehad the twenties . Apparently they did n't read the papers , forthey gave no sign of knowing that the country was in the very depths of an economic disaster . They were men who had been sheltered all their lives and were sheltered yet . Their world was the world of their own needs alone , and if they  |p233looked  out of a window at the street below , nothing they saw , or nobody down there , had any relationship to their own safe halls . Brokers and buyers , efficiency experts with private means , personnel managers from banking families , men who had been born to ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole contented clan of white-collar foxes whose hearts were in their collars and their love locked in their files , who yet wanted to know of life  --  " What 's the answer ? " Without pausing once to wonder what was the question . " These are class people , " Finnerty tried to impress his girls . " If one tells you to swing from the chandelier , baby , you swing . " " Why not just sell the beds and buy trapezes for the money ? " the new child wanted to know right off . " You 're always in there with the wise answer , ai nt you ? " Oliver warned her . " Because you 're always there with the right question , LittleDaddy , " Kitty tried quickly to soften her new daddy . Against the collar clan the lunch bucket brigadiers  --  boilermakers , janitors , construction workers , merchant mariners , grease-monkeys , slaughter house bullies , plasterers and brick layers did n't stand a chance . The collars had fancied love up until the best looking and youngest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why tie up a piece of merchandise for half an hour with a date smelling of fish or tar , when one smelling of nothing but after-shave lotion would pay five times as much and perhaps not even soil a towel ? " Mama , " Oliver gave out the news , " we 're going to forget these workin ' - ass bums who do n't even know a girl has a soul . I know one pimp willing to stand on the corner waiting for a broad to turn a three-dollar trick so he can get a haircut ,  |p234but  I do n't call that a pimp . I got every one of my broads insuredand I got a plane to keep up too . What the workin ' - ass man wants he can get elsewhere . From here on out we cater strictly to the bug who wants something he 's afraid to ask his wife for  --  or what he 'd rather not have her give . Or what she ca n't give . " " I 'm not sure I 'm following , Oliver . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Well , I do n't care for where I think you 're leading . What can any girl of ours give a man that his wife ca n't ? " " Virginity , woman , " the pander almost spat the word  --  virginity . Else how is it that when I say to some clown  --  Would you like to see the girls , mister ? ' he just dogeyes me and keeps on walking . But when I say , Mister , are you interested in a girl who 's never been had ? ' it 's just too much for him . He slows down , thinking it over , turns the corner , comes back on the other side of the street and all I have to do is wait . He comes to me then . What did you mean by that ? ' he wants to know and by the way he says it I know whether he 's the law or a bug . I meant are you interested in witnessing a girl giving in for the first time ? ' Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up with a ten-spot just on a promise like that . Honest to God , some days I feel rotten about everyone but myself . " " Some days I feel rotten about you too , Oliver , " Mama admitted . The little man sat clasping his stomach as though in pain . " What kind of a sport would n't hop to a chance like we 're offering ? Why , it 's like having a girl 's very soul . Love he can get at home  --  but the soul , the soul  --  Did his mother neglect him ? Did his auntie seduce him ? Did his mother-in-law rob him ? Did his wife desert him ? Did his mistress betray him  --  Here 's a chance to get even with them all . " " Calm yourself , Oliver , " Mama urged him , " because no man is coming for no such purpose to any house of mine , "  |p235Mama  found her voice at last , " I 've been an underworld woman all my days . I have faith my Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight with Him and straight with my-self  --  " "  --  and straight with your girls too , of course , " Finnerty stopped her . His very tone stopped her . " Sit down , old woman . There 's something I 've been meaning to have out with you and this is as good a time as any . " Mama sat down . " It 's a little matter of a bill that went into your hand a C note and came back to me as a ten spot . If it had been any broad but the Looney I 'd think maybe it was her and not you . But it 's true that the girl never actually looked at that bill  --  I 've watched her take money time and again and she never looks at it , just puts it away until she sees me , then hands over the lot . So I know she gave it to you as she got it  --  old woman , it was you pulled the gypsy switch on your best , your only friend . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old woman ? " " Oliver , if I know what you 're talking about I 'll kiss your behind before God . " Finnerty cocked his head a bit at that . " You know what you just said is as strong a statement I 've heard a Louisiana nigger make to a white man for some time ? " " Oliver , it 's the truth . I do n't know what you 're talking about . " " Look , " he began losing patience . " I whupped the broad and she said No . ' I whupped her harder and she still said No . ' Finally I took my mittens off , ready to give her the real thing . She still said No . ' Mama , I do n't want to whup you . But I know it was n't the broad . I know it was you . " Mama could scarcely bear the injustice of this . " For God 's sake , boy . What makes you so sure it was n't the mark who switched on you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wasp236going to take you to come up with that . It do n't go , old woman . I never took eye off that bill from the moment I put it in the mark 's pocket . " " Were you in the room when he gave it to the girl ? " " As good as . I had my eye to the hole . " " How could you see the number on the bill through a key-hole ? " The shadow of a doubt passed across the pander 's mind  --  but he recalled the sheer simplicity of Dove 's face and the shadow passed . It just could n't be . For that redheaded countryboy had n't been just an ordinary mark . He had been a mark 's mark , the kind a man might wait a lifetime to meet , so simple it was pathetic . " Any one but him , Mama , " he told her  --  then suddenly realizing how very near she had come to throwing him off the track he made up his mind twice as firmly as before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own lips that it was you who switched on me and nobody but you . " Mama knew that tone and could only sit shaking her head miserably , " No . No . Let me die the worst death there is if I took it . " Finnerty rose . " Oliver , I know what you 're going to do . But I just ca n't fix my mouth to say what you want me to . " Finnerty pulled on a single mitten . He drew the cloth down tight over each separate finger . When every wrinkle had been smoothed he turned his wrist slowly to test its hinge . Then he drew on the other glove . " Yes , " Mama told him . " Yes . Yes . Yes . " " I knew you done it all the time , " Finnerty said , " and I 'm not billing you for it . But never let me hear you say again that you play it straight . Not to me you do n't say it . Here . " He poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a spilling a drop . But Mama 's hand shook so when she took it he had to help her to bring it to her lips . When itp237was empty she held it out for more , He filled it again . This time she drank more steadily . And still she wanted more . " If I can save one sparrow a single misstep , " she began . " That 'll do for now , old woman , " Finnerty told her , " I 've got work to do and so have you . " And left to study his mouse . What passed for the Wrath To Come on the walk and what passed for the Wrath inside the parlor were hells an earth apart . Though that amateur savior warned the women of the middle-pits of Hell , the women themselves felt sure that the pits were reserved exclusively for finks . Certainly no reasonable God would hold a grudge against a girl for earning her bread by the sweat of the sex with which He had blessed her . But to save one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth the name would overlook as lousy a trick as that . Beside , God must be on their side because He was on Mama 's . And was n't Mama forever bringing home moulting canaries or bargain goldfish because she felt sorry for them ? Did n't she say almost every day , " If I can save one sparrow a single misstep it makes my own missteps worthwhile ? " Long after midnight old lonely trains called up to Mama like lovers forever arriving too late for love . Up from the long grieving river they called , past track and tower and dock , to windows long darkened and doorways long locked ; old beaux that had walked Perdido Street long ago , returning to mourn the names of girls they had loved . They had plenty to spend and all night for loving . But the windows were darkened , the doors were locked , and the only girls whose names they knew had no name now but dust . Mama would rise from her bed so wide , the Woman The Pope Did n't Want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so watchful of the sparrow 's fall until a dollarp238was involved . And saw some too-late lover come to stand belowa lamp that made the whole night look hired . Down on the corner she heard some woman jangling around for a straight four dollar trick . Then her husband , down the block , signaling with a set of keys of his own  --  " I got a trick here , Baby , so come on home . " And the empty night came down again . From somewhere upstairs or somewhere down , a mountaingirl 's voice began telling the darkOh blow away the morning dewAnd knew , Mama knew that soon or late the hour would come when the hurry-up wagon would haul girls with pride and girls with none , those who had saved and those without Penny One , to that cellar below the cells where one door leads to freedom and another door leads to jail . One back to the street and one to a tier . That some would buy out then and some would bail out and some would cry off on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet the winds do blow " If I ca n't die sanctified , " Mama crossed herself where she stood , " at least let me die blessed . " Because the air was so close , the whiskey so bad , the prices so high and the place so hard to climb up to , every one came to Dockery 's Dollhouse night after night while other bars stayed empty . Every one came , that is , but the law . To this lopsided shambles , where the floor slanted slightly , no police ever came . When the big hush fell that meant trouble was starting , the old man drew the shutters until the trouble was done . The old man had himself never fought another man in his life  --  yet he took a senile pleasure in watching others go atp239it . He pretended that it was the manly thing , to " let them fight it out "  --  but the titillating joy he took when the first blood flowed was a womanish delight . And though there were frequent brawls , he took care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside . Only the steady thud of the fans overhead and a desperatescuffle of shoes and breath would be heard when two panders fought up and down the floor . Suddenly as it began it would be done . Doc would be lettingin the light , victor and vanquished would be having a shot on the house , the babble of voices would rise once more , the juke would start Dream Train or It 's Only a Paper Moon  --  and everyone would feel something real had been accomplishedat last . " Let 's see what them damn mackers are up to , " hustlers would suggest to each other on afternoons off  --  " I 'd rather see a fight tonight than ride the New York Central  --  " If a man were hurt so seriously that he could not rise to drink , old Doc poured a shot down his throat personally , and friends hoisted him and deposited him behind some less lucky dive . Yet all the fights were strangely unnecessary , and not one of them ever solved anything . The mackers never fought over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daddy really told Easy Rider 's woman that she did n't dress her man with class ? Had Easy Rider actually said that Spanish Max would stool on his own mother ? They fought for their honor , that must have been it . Not because they had too much whiskey in them , but because they had n't enough . Their lives went dry as their glasses ; lack of love parched their throats . They wished to be drunken , forever drunken . " Too much salt on the potato chips , " someone was always complaining to Dockery . " Them chips is what gives people a thirst , " Doc explained ,  | " it 's why the mustard bowls is always full and plenty of good old salty pretzels too . " To be drunken , forever drunken . Yet Dove came there at noon , long before the drinkers ' hour , only to put his sample case below the table and his book above it , to order a poor boy sandwich and a bottle of beer . Then the book before him , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different an A was from a B.He was studying M and N one noon when a shadow fell across the page and Finnerty 's finger shut the book like shuttingit forever . " What kind of con is this  --  Fairy Tales  --  you connin ' little kids or something now , country boy ? " Dove took his book and pocketed it . " Hello , Oliver , " he said . Finnerty shook his head incredulously . " To think I took you for the simplest fool in town . To think that I thought that W on your forehead stood for Watkins . " " I 'm in the field for Watkins , Mister , " Dove reminded the pander with understandable pride . " Man , you are great . Simply great . And the sample case tops it . Just tops it . Lugging that thing with your country look , who could ever have guessed what your real line of goods was ? " He pulled a chair beside Dove 's , and sat so near and talked so low , his mouth right at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , that Dove felt trapped between him and the wall . " Buddy , as your buddy , " Oliver whispered wetly , " it 's now my duty to tell you that my new child got one terrible hard edge out for you . It 's all I can do to keep her from coming in on you . No , I do n't mean that real hard swindle where she took the rap and you went south with the bundle . I doubt Texas will extradite you for that . But how 's your conscience resting , buddy ? Did you know the broad done a hundredp241days without commissary ? You and I both know what it is to be busted without a pack , Jack . Of course if that 's how you expect your broads to do time that 's your business . But 1 would n't treat a yellow dog like that . " " Mister , " Dove tried to get his little finger unhooked , " Mister , that old gal quoted you a mistruth . " " I hope you are n't thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own sample case buddy ? The very buddy who broke in my top-earning broad for me ? " Oliver was hurt that Dove should even suspect him of forgetting a favor like that  --  " Naturally she lied . Who ever heard of a hustling woman who would n't rather lie than ride a passenger train ? Buddy , what I 'm telling you is I 'm going to get you out of this . Man , I been to Hurtsville , I know what it is . They made me regret the day I was born there but they ai nt going to make my sample case buddy regret the day he was born . What if she does claim she was underage when you transportedher across a state line in a moving vehicle ? That do n't cut ice with Oliver Finnerty . " " Mister , " Dove got in a word at last  --  " I never transported nobody . We just rode a old freight train a ways together , that was all . You 'd scarcely call that'a moving vehicle ' I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been Dove 's idea  --  " What would you call it , Mr. Bigass ? A possum up a telegraph pole ? " " Well , it were n't no passinger train . " " Brother , " Finnerty put a hand on Dove 's shoulder , " Brother , it do n't matter was that a box car or on roller skates , that broad can swear out a hold order for you in any district station in town  --  " " I pulled her out from under the wheels ! " Dove remembered in a shout  --  " I treated her good ! " Finnerty shook his head solemnly . " You can always treatp242one too good , " he reminded Dove , " but you can never treat one too bad . " " I saved her dirty fool life , " Dove added , yet felt his couragesliding down all drains . " I 'm sure you did , " Finnerty agreed sympathetically , " but still it do n't cut ice . " " She were willin ' , " Dove recalled desperately . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She got more willin ' all the time . Fact is I took to sleepin ' on my stomach , she were that willin ' . " " Willin ' do n't matter . Under age is statutory rape though she put a gun at your head . " " She did n't have no gun , " Dove conceded , " but I sure did n't sexutory-rape nobody , mister  --  " yet strangely flushed with guilt . " We 've all done crazy things from time to time , " Oliver lowered his voice for he read that flush aright  --  " What I alwayssay is if you 're not champeenship material , you might as well let the women get you now . Buddy , a broad is only a broad but a pal is a pal , so put your mind at rest . I 'm not lettingTexas get no holder on you because some broad wants to cry off . It 'd be as good as her life and I 've told her as much . Baby , ' I told her , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying off on my pal is another . ' Now do you want me to see you through this sorry situation you got yourselfinto or do n't you ? " Dove was beginning to feel scared in a way he had never been scared before . " I 'd be mighty grateful for your help , mister . " " One good turn deserves another . But I 'll expect your completecooperation from here on out . I 'm the general . You 're the private  --  when I give an order I expect to see it carried out . For I 'm not without help , " he added softly . " You 're my captain , " Dove agreed , " I 'm your hand . But there just one little favor I 'd like to ask . "  | " What 's that , old buddy ? " " Do n't call me Mr. Bigass . " " Shake  --  Tex . " Finnerty extended his hand . Dove shook it with gratitude . " I 've kept my part of the bargain , mister , " Dove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That you did , and I 'm that proud of you I 'll brag you up all over town , " he promised  --  " Come and get it . " He held out a five dollar bill . Dove turned it over as though the number on the other side might be different , then passed it to Frenchy . " Tell ' em where you got it and how easy it was , " he told her , and walked indolently toward the door . A huge disbelief dawned in Finnerty 's brain . He caught up with Dove at Dockery 's door . He was a little out of breath and waited till they were inside to offer Dove a drink . " Give this man what he wants to drink , " he told Dockery breathlessly , " any time he wants it . " " Any time this man wants a drink , " Dove assured Dockery , " he 'll pay for it hisself , " and laid a C note on the bar before the pander 's eyes . Finnerty started to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I understand the price is ten bucks per peeper , Oliver , " he told Finnerty . " You had a full house . I 'll take my thirty now . " Finnerty went for his wallet . Slowly . Yet he went . " I 'd never of believed it , " he admitted , laying three tens on top of the C note , " I would n't of give you the credit for the having the cold nerve . " " You provide the virgins , mister , " Dove promised , " I 'll provide the nerve . " " I guess you know I had to give a poor broad a ninety dollarwhupping account of you ? " Finnerty reproved Dove asp244he watched a hundred and thirty dollars disappear in Dove 's wallet . " It 's what I always say , " Dove told him cheerfully , " you can always treat one too good . But you never can treat one too bad . " Airless days when panties of purple and braes of black , silverg strings and dappled halters hung on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as all Brazil . A jungle whose foliage was such garments of bright shame as were washable , whose cries were those of the pepper pot manAll hot ! All hot ! Makee back strong ! Makee live long ! Come buy my pepper pot ! Odors , and cries , a chemise stained by mascara , the spill of water into a basin before the long day 's first-risen lover locked with the last girl left awake . They went at it like foes , navel to navel , still his two dollars of passion was spent . Then just as he stood with one sock drawn on and the other foot bare , he was touched by a perfumed disgust . Disgust like a perfume pervading a forenoon that felt perpetual ; till noon mixed with evening and evening with night . Then a reddish scent as of soap or blood and the voices of women and an air of haste began somewhere upstairs or somewhere down . Then cigar-smoke mixed with eau-decologneand incense with whiskey and whiskey with gin . Then sometimes upstairs and sometimes down Dove Linkhorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes in a yellow , wearing cowboy boots and a black silk bandanna , one foot on Dockery'sbar-rail or leaning on Dockery 's juke , he wasted no time in letting strangers know who he was . " Shake hands with Big Stingaree ! Just up from the Riop245Grande ! See these boots ? They cost forty dollars . See this hat ? Cost thirty-five . I do most of the drinking here ' n all the buying . Anything you want , just point . I take care of my friends . You want to say hello to a girl , just say which one . They 're most of ' em mine but I 'm not the jealous kind , I pass ' em around ' cause I know they 'll come back . They always come back to their Daddy-O .

Tell him what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner or later I 'll be by with one on one arm and one on the other and most like a new shirt one of ' em 's just bought me . See this belt ? A girl give me that . " The whiskey brown , the rum so black , the beer so dark , the gin so pale . " Could n't read my name were it wrote a foot high on the side of a barn but I make more in a single day than some educated fools earn in a month . Drink up . " Whiskey , corn liquor , gin or rye , Big Stingaree drank it down . Big Stingaree drank whatever was poured , till drops dribbled down his shirt red or yellow and beer stood in his boots . Once he stood up in a puddle of urine or wine , and his face looked lopsided with its load of rum . He waved his arms till somebody shut off the juke . Big Stingaree had something to tell all panderdom . " Burn down your cities ! " he demanded ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . " Burn down your cities ' n save our farms , " he concluded lamely . " Well , go on , go on . " But whatever it was he was trying to recall , that was all Dove could remember . For sometimes once a day , sometimes twice , Finnerty 's gentlemen stood with eyes fixed to a wall to achieve vicariouslythat ancestral lust : the deflowering of a virgin . Finnerty was right : it was a fantasy that had pursued them ,  |p246every  one , all their lives ; they had not pursued it . They had only made of it a secret mystery that never could come true . A mystery as false as it was secret . Yet Finnerty made it whirl with fiery colors , like a pinwheel in the dark ; that becomes , when it is not spun , no more than a piece of painted wood . He instructed the girls not to yield their chastity easily , but only with tears , after a bit of a struggle . At this game Floralee was no hand at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game now had a new twist . Nor did she wish to understand . As soon as Dove entered and hung up his stetson she threw off every stitch and in a voice like little bells on a silver string began play-partying -- Cat had a kitten , kitten had a pupshe invited Dove to clap hands with herSay old man is your rhubarb up ? Nobody could make her understand that that was n't at all how lovely reluctant virgins carried on . There 's plenty of rhubarb all around the farm And another little drink wo n't do us any harm . Reba , on the other hand , played her part too well . Racing from one corner to another , she would shrink like a wild trapped thing , burying her face in her hands and crying " Never ! " to the walls , " Never ! Never ! Never ! " Beating Dove 's chest with both her fists , again her plate slipped as she pled for her honor . Yet that in no wise dismayedher . Good trouper that she was , she kept right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Never ! Never ! Never ! " Considering the abortions she had survived , she was surprisinglyfleet . Feinting Dove out of position , she would leave him breathless there in nothing but red garters and boots . At length he was forced to complain to Finnerty . " I admire talent in a woman , " he protested , " and I do n't expect one to make things easy for me  --  but chasing that onep247247up and down and around is simply wearing me out . She 's a fine little broad and all of that , but she 's just too zeelious . " Sometimes the virgin was Frenchy . Kitty clamored to get into the act but the amateurish tattooing on her arms and legs , that she had inflicted upon herself as a child , disbarred her . " Who ever heard of a tattooed virgin ? " Finnerty dismissed her . " I 'll keep my clothes on , " she offered . " They 'd want their money back , " Finnerty told her , " get down to the door where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you off your post again . " She did not perceive that had she only acted reluctant about performing , he would have appointed her to be defloweredupstairs instead of merely to stand guard below , hour upon dull hour . It was never Hallie . It never could be Hallie . Yet what Finnerty would have given to get that one in there ! There was no way of debauching her . She had been in a thousand corners with a thousand men and had come away with herselfuntouched . It gnawed at him , just as it gnawed him that every time one of these Never ! Never ! innocents was deprived of her maidenhoodhe had to divide sixty dollars with Dove  --  admittedly a generous wage for that type of work . " There are those who 'd be happy to give me a hand for nothing , " he told Dove . " Fly-by-nighties , " Dove reminded him , " here today and gone tomorrow . " It was true , and Finnerty knew it , that Dove could not be replaced . Every time Finnerty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was giving an honest day 's work for an honestwage . Reliable to the bone . And , nothing , it seemed , impededhis tidelike powers . Like the sea , he came and went.  |p248Indeed  , Finnerty could not contain his secret enthusiasm for Dove 's prowess . " You never seen nothing like it , " he invitedLegless Schmidt to see , " God has put his arms around that ungodly clown . " " Why would God put his arms around something like that ? You can leave God out of it , for I wo n't pay a nickel . " " I would n't think of asking you to pay , " Finnerty employedhis injured air . " I just thought you 'd get a laugh out of the thing . " " It 's nothing to laugh about , " the big half told the pander . " How can you tell till you 've seen it ? " Finnerty insisted " How this mad stud comes on ! Man , it 's educational . " " Thank you , I 'll stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over , friend , " Finnerty suggested , " the offer isgood any time . " Why he wanted to involve Schmidt , Finnerty himself was n't clear in his own mind . He resented the crippled man 's air of independence as unbecoming when able-bodied men were out begging , but that was n't all of it . It was Hallie 's dismissalof his own charms , made so lightly , that was at the bottom of it . How could a woman prefer a man without legs to a little beauty like himself ? If you could n't get at somebody yourself , Finnerty knew , your next best bet is to get at somebody who has already gotten to her . And whether for laughs or whether for lust , his mathematicsof the soul began to add up nicely . Some white collar bug would wander in pretending to look for a friend ; then another friend-seeker and another , till there were five or six . One by one Finnerty would take them out for a little private talk , and then his voice could be heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Till the bargain was sealed and a ten dollar bill changed hands . When the buyer put his eye to the peep-hole for which he had paid , he saw only a pale , demented girl , blonde braidsp249bound tightly about her head , wearing a simple cotton frock and her pale hands folded in her lap . Then in strode some kind of redheaded hayseed in a sheriff 's hat with a flashy cord and boots that were all but spurred  --  the hiders could almost smell the whiskey on him . When the hayseedtook off his hat the pale girl loosened her frock . What a dunce the fellow looked after that ! The only sound in the room was his heavy breathing and the whirr-whirr-whirr of the ceiling fan slicing the obscene heat . What a clown ! He was going about his job in there as though it were hero 's work , a thing no one else could possibly do . Some felt contempt of the shameless dunce , but not all . Each watcher was affected differently . One paled slowly as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking how sad such things were so . Another laughed smugly deep as his liver , to see proven at last what he had long suspected : a man was a two-legged animaland a woman a four-legged one , nothing more . And left thinking how lucky it was , such things being so , that he had been there to see . Yet a third looked thoughtful , as at a demonstration in carpet weaving : see , there was still money to be made in small enterprise . Another felt stale lusts grow swift and bit his lip for lack of cash : had he every dollar in town tonight , all would be spent by morning . But the great cripple neither laughed nor paled . Only the lines of his heavy head hardened and he swung his torso on its tiny wheels and wheeled off down the hall , making a rolling thunder to hide his indignation . No , Schmidt did n't believe in this sort of thing at all . The other peepers would be sitting in the parlor once more when Dove returned downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight of the fellow combing his hair or playing the juke , seemingly innocent that he had performed publicly ,  |p250sent  such glances of cold glee back and forth that soon every one had their money 's worth . That the joke , after all , was on themselves , was a bit of knowledge Finnerty took pains not to divulge . Had they understood that the dunce in the stetson was not only aware that he was watched , but was secretly proud to display his powers , they might have mobbed both Dove and Finnerty . Schmidt , of course , knew the story , and did n't share the amusement others felt . From a corner where the light hardly fell he studied Dove . Big Stingaree 's shirt was open at the throat and his throat was flushed to the chin , for he had thirty dollars to spend once again . And was spending it the way he 'd found it went fastest , by buying drinks for everyone . " He do n't know the show is over , " Schmidt realized , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So God took Caruso awayDove began mugging silently with the singer , pretending it was his own voice mourning Caruso . " I wish I could sing truly , " he would lament when Caruso was done , " but I lost my voice hollerin ' for gravy . " This legless man was an old carnie hand who had lived among human skeletons , Soo-pound women , dog-faced boys , spider men , living heads , geeks , half-men-half-women and dwarfs in the maimed world of sideshow exhibitions ; but it seemed to him he had never seen anyone who filled him with such disgust as this grinning pimpified country braggart pretendinghe was Enrico Caruso . When the song was done Dove spotted Hallie . He came up beside her , raised her glass , drained it and called  --  " Bartender ! This lady needs a drink ! " Hallie covered her glass with her hand . " What you settin ' at the bar for if you do n't want to drink ? " Dove demanded . THE WILD SIDE 251 " I 'd rather buy my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " his bravado began to crumble , " I done nothing against you . " " I just do n't like to drink on someone who do n't know what he 's doing , that 's all . " For reply he took a whole tumbler of gin and gulped it down in a single breath , then set it back on the bar with a sigh . " What did it prove that time ? " she asked him . " It prove I can drink gin , " Dove informed her . " That you 've already proved . I have n't seen you sober in a week . " " Whose money is it , mine or yours ? " " Yours , " she assured him , and turning away , left him weaving . Schmidt was waiting for her at the door . " What were you two whispering about ? " the cripple barred her way . " I told him I think he 's killing himself . " " Then let him . The sooner the better . " Yet once it was morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cat . After the long night of riot the spiders , that at midnight had twisted and swung on their metal wires , now hung motionless . The night was done and the early light lay scattered about like broken glass , as if people had picnicked in a mausoleum here . And as in mausoleum the air felt exhausted . So close , so very still , that a sun mote in its silent play seemed like a sick-ward child told be quiet while its nurse sleeps on . Hallie saw the pale mote searching a floor where the dead lay against the dead : a whole platoon of cokes had been wiped out at the foot of the juke , and the juke itself looked like it might never play again . A single gin-fifth , the last of its line , lay face down where it had fallen , surrounded by dead butts and snipes that hadp252burned themselves out on the floor . Bobbie pins , kleenex wads , beer caps , wine corks , a deck ripped savagely in two and tossed across the carpet in despair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which no quarter had been given . Yet from somewhere heard a murmurous breathing , regular and slow . She followed the mote that searched , like herself , for the . sole survivor too . Hunched in a corner so deeply bent she thought he was sleeping , sat the boy with the face too young yet too old . " Wake up , " she told him . He rose and stood trying to pull the various parts of the Big Stingaree together while hiding something behind his back . " Now what are you up to ? " " I 'm sober , " was his curious reply . " But you 'll be drunk by noon . " " It 's my money . " " You told me that yesterday . " " I made sixty dollars yesterday . How much did you make ? " He had Big Stingaree 's parts almost together . " If that 's how you feel , give me back my book . " He brought it from behind his back . " I do n't know how it happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course it must be yours because you got all the knowance of books and I got nary knowance at all . Yet I do n't see how that give you the right to mock others for ignorance . " " I never mocked you , Dove . You can have the book . " " It do n't do me no good , for I ca n't read as you well know and you 're mocking me in offering it . " " If you can stay sober till noon for a week , I 'll teach you to read . " He took her up so quickly she grew suspicious and touched the book to take it back . " If you 're sober at noon you can have it back . " He would n't let her have it . " If I 'm not sober I 'll bring it back myself . That 's a promise . "  | " You 'll be too tight to remember any promise . " He was sober at noon . He was still sober at four . At five Finnerty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , still sober , and without a word handed her the book . " Bartender ! " he shouted to Dockery , and his knuckles were white on the bar  --  " Gin ! Gin ! Gin ! " That night Dove dreamed he was alone in a hotel in Houston . Somewhere in the room a cat was trying to throw up  --  it had something in its throat it could n't swallow . He looked under a divan for it and behind a juke and then below a cot bed but everything was swathed in a mist , he could see nothing plain . Then a shadow moved in the mist and Hallie 's cat made a dash for it right across the floor and disappeared into somebody'sroom . She was hiding something there she did n't want anyone else to see ; she 'd been up to something for some time now . Something was wrong with the animal but nobody dared to say what . Behind a radiator it had hidden the baretoothed carcass of a kitten dead for weeks , and was suckling it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jaw but the brindle put her mouth to the wasted belly and pushed against the deathstretchedhide . Dove began beating it to make it quit but it felt no blows ; though he beat it a long time . At last it looked around at him . Along its whiskers fresh milk gleamed , and the dream went out slowly , like a twenty-watt night bulb saying goodnight . Nobody on Perdido Street considered the legless man a freak . No one told that once , for a few brief weeks , he had once let himself be billed as one . For no one who knew that lion-browed gaze could doubt his profound naturalness . Below the heavy brows his eyes , set wide , burned even as candles in a room with no wind . Schmidt never blinked . He sat his platformlike a saint of the amputees and gave you gaze for gaze . When at last you turned your eyes away he touched his littlep254brown beard as much as to say , " I 've seen enough of you too , friend . " He sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both dark and light and never forgot his dignity ; nor permitted others to forget it . Once a girl had told him , " Keep your money , you need it worse than me , " and had meant it kindly . But the man waiting like a mutilated statue on the low bed 's edge , had paled below his tan . " You should never have said that , sis , " he told her and lowered himself and left . Yet , the very next afternoon , the same girl had handed him a five dollar bill for a twenty-five cent bottle of perfumed water and he 'd pocketed the five without even the pretense of making change . Some saint . When you gave , he felt , you gave it all . When you took you took it all . Now , nearing forty , having rebuilt his whole life on the rock of sheer courage , he felt the rock shift and could not believe it . Surely a man who has been once destroyed and fought back to the land of the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not permit it . He was Schmidt who needed nobody , he was Schmidt who could never lose . And yet when he thought of Hallie , surely the rock slipped . Flow had his life , that he 'd held so hard , come to be cupped lightly in a woman 's palm , and the woman herself to be held in any nameless stranger 's arms ? The thought sent him kneewalking about his small room , pounding his stumps in a blood-colored tantrum ; for the neon traffic light beside his window flashed from red to dull gold and back to the hue of blood again . The stumps ! The stumps were to blame for everything ! " One at the hip and one at the knee "  --  he punished both at once with his hands like hammers , sending a wire of white pain zig-zagging through his breast to his brain.  |p255The  stumps ! The dirty stumps ! He gasped like a great seal for air , air . Not again . Not twice . Then composing himself began to wheel slowly , for wheelingwas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and remembering , loved again . Saw her standing in a beadcurtaindoorway as though even now she were waiting only for him ; and how she would turn her head slowly when he rolled in , and how she would not look at him with pity , and how her mouth would say " darling " just to him . " I 'll get this out of my system tonight once and for all , " Schmidt promised himself . But before he 'd go to Mama 's he 'd have a taste of Dockery 's booze , to numb the pain in the stumps before making love . And a bit of talk with other cripples to numb the pain in his breast . Dockery catered to cripples , and one that was almost sure to be on hand was Kneewalking Johnson ; whose handicaps were greater even than Schmidt 's own . Johnson was a Negro , and owned no platform . He had padded his stumps with leather and reinforced the pads with tin . To Schmidt there was something so backward about stumping up and down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it his duty to modernize Johnson . " Get on this thing , " he ordered . Johnson did n't want any part of the platform , yet did n't wish to offend the Big Half . " I get along alright , Mister ' chilies , " he reported without looking at the raft , " I got my own way . " " Can you back ? " Schmidt demanded . " Can you swivel ? Can you move sidewise ? Can you make good time ? " And to show just what he meant he wheeled straight toward the juke , made an airbrake stop  --  " back ! " he backed , " swivel ! " he swiveled , " sidewise ! " his hands on the wheels seemed mechanically driven , pimps and cripples and their girls scattered while cool heads got chairs in front of them  --  it was like being in a swimmingpool with a rudderless motorboat.  |p256Dockery  stayed in the dark of his bar so that none might see his narrow smile . He loved seeing men and women in panic and flight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sins . Whatever ran over them only served them right , that smile revealed . " Now let 's see you try it , " Schmidt paused at last . Johnson had no choice . Hands lifted him and other hands buckled him fast , then everyone stood back . " Give the man room , " Schmidt commanded , " give the man a chance . " So the old man with kinked hair gone white , and nothing beneath his chest but a pair of short pants that small boys wear , put his hands , that were only half the breadth of Schmidt 's and yet a full inch longer , to the wheels . And rolled himself gently back and forth , forth and back . Only a timid roll forward , only a shy roll back . As though he had not a room as big as a dance floor to move in but just a tiny cell . It was no use . Nobody could get Johnson to be more daring . It grew tiresome watching him roll those few feet up and back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music might liven the old man up . But when the music began all that happened was that the old man sang along with it and rolled no faster than before . Ninety-nine year so jumpin ' longhe made a strange , sorrowing cripple 's danceTo be here rollin ' an ' taint go homeOughta come on de river in 1910Dey was drivin ' de women des like de menWell I wonder what 's de matter , somepin ' must be wrong I 'm still here rollin ' but everybody gone " Now you see how much better it is my way ? " Schmidt told him when he 'd performed as best he could and had been allowed to unbuckle himself and kneewalk to the bar for the beer that was his reward . " Once you get used to it , " Schmidtp257assured him , " you 'll be ashamed that you ever went around in that old-fashioned way . I 'll get you the wood , I 'll get you the skates and straps , I 'll even put it together for you . Man , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Chilies , " the Negro felt obliged to assert himself at last , " what you do n't keep in mind is I caint work main-town routes like you . I ai nt allowed on Canal , I ai nt allowed in white neighborhoods . They tells me to get my livin ' off my own people ' n the walks is all bust and cracked out there . Lots of places ai nt no walks at all , just old rutty wagon roads . I come to a broke walk or a mud-hole after rain , what I 'm gon na do with a big old board like that ? I got to unstrop myself , haul that old board through the mud or down a drop , then strop me up again . So you see , Mister ' Chilies , I would n't be savin ' time , I 'd be losin ' it . " But Schmidt had suddenly lost interest . Turned to a total stranger at the bar and asked , " Jack , what 's your frank opinion of a woman who 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name ? " He 'd torture himself like that , as lovers always have . For what would begin when he 'd wheel into Mama 's was one of those mysteries born only in brothels  --  a relationship with a deep river 's surpassing strength : that had swept two unready people into its current and now carried them past dumb faces on the shore . Faces awe-struck or compassionate at sight of so was holding the big door wide when Schmidt rolled in . Like a statue of serenity calmly smiling . " Hallie ! At last your husband 's come ! " Mama called at once . He had a greeting and a smile for every girl in the place butHallie . Floralee kissed his big hand , Frenchy stroked his hairdark yet silvered , the one half-out-of-her-mind child and thep258other with no mind to be out of , letting the pair of them competeto see which could get his straps unbuckled first . When each stepped back with a captured strap it was as though his stumps had springs  --  he leaped right into the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around with triumphant pride . Yet had not so much as noticed Hallie . Instead he shoved his hands down his pockets and came up with his palms filled with nickels , dimes , even half dollars  --  " Count it , girls ! Count it ! "  --  and slung every cent into the mildly astonished air  --  " Count it ! Count it all ! " Frenchy and Floralee went down on all fours , diving under divans , hopping like rabbits , scurrying like mice . In a moment Kitty Twist followed , crawling , creeping , elbowing the others . But the sallow woman in the portiere standing so silently never moved , though a coin rolled right to her feet . " The most generous man I 've ever known , " Mama decided right there . " Just buying like everyone else as far as I can see , " Kitty Twist perceived . " I notice when he 's buying ' you 're right in there with your elbow in everybody 's eye getting your full share , " Hallie remindedthe new child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly  --  " You stoop like everyone else . " " Why , I make my living here , honey , if that 's what you mean , " Hallie replied without heat , " what line of work are you in ? " Kitty grew more careful after that , for as much as the women heckled one another about their dates , they spared Hallie 's relationship to Schmidt . " You in the brown dress , " he called to her as though he had not noticed her till now , " step out here where we can see what you got . " Hallie was obliged to stand alone in the parlor 's center be/tween Schmidt and the juke 's unblinking eye . Like a sultan , he gripped the point of his little brown beard as he studied her manner of walking . And like a sultan swung his hand , to indicatehe was now ready to view her from behind . " Is this one healthy ? " he asked Mama after a moment . " I hold you responsible . " But Mama was counting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door  --  it was plain they felt their big daddy was overdoing things tonight . Big Dad did n't feel he was overdoing a thing . He slid down off the divan and kneewalked around his selection . And turning her head on her olive throat to follow the torso as it stumped , she thought , " What a man he must have been ! " For even on stumps Schmidt moved with grace . " I 'll have a go at this one , " he decided aloud , and swung himself after her through the portiere , his head just barely higher than her waist , with the satisfied pride of a man who has driven a cunning bargain . But the moment the door shut behind them both pride and satisfaction fled  --  he seized her hand , kissed each separate finger , pressed his head hard right under her heart and clasped her as though she were the life he had lost . It was the stumps made him act like he had , he told her . It was all the fault of the stumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be contained . And after a while smiled down , stroked his hair and agreed as with a child : yes , it was all the fault of his stumps . To such tenderness he reacted like an enormous cat . And rolled within his massive arms , pressed to the great cave of his chest , his lion 's breath against her breast , she felt his passion relentlessly driving . And then it was as though no man till Legless Schmidt had possessed her . Many had rented her , none had possessed her . Not for one moment , not even to the man she had married , had Hallie been subjugated as this shattered athlete subjugated her . To be **25;9961;TOOLONG stretches . He made you think of telephone poles leaning infinitely on along a highway that went forever toward the mountains . You could no more talk to him than you could talk to a song . " I hate to say this , " said Duncan , going toward the door , " but until this election is over and I 've won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't think you 'd best be dropping by the house again . " Jimmy Tallant did not answer him or protest . He did not bat an eye . It seemed that his face darkened slightly , as though dark had come strongly between them through the front door when Duncan opened it . " I might drop by the jail and get that nigger , " he said . " I 'll be ready for you , " said Duncan . " You gots a long time to wait , " said Beck Dozer . " It 's not but ten o'clock . " " If it 's much later maybe they 'll be too sleepy or too drunk , " Duncan said . " But in the earlier hours , or so I have read , they still have got their daylight minds . It takes the midnight mind to do the black deed to the black man . " " Oh , Jesus , " said Lu . " Do n't make it sound so true , Brer Beck . " Duncan laughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nigger women saying Oh Jesus do n't make it sound so true , every time you paused to mop your brow . You could preach them in and out of hell all day long , stop long enough to go outdoors and eat fried chicken , and take a different one home every night . " " And you think that would be the end , " said Beck Dozer , " of the so-called Negro question . " " They call it bread and circuses , " said Duncan.  | " Why , so they do , " said Beck . " This is the first time I done ever darkened a jail door , " said Lu . " And now look . " The two men were seated in cane-bottom chairs on either side of the cold stove . The Negro woman had retreated into the corner of the nearest cell and had begged Duncan until he had locked her in . She wanted to make sure that an iron door stood between her and whoever might arrive . Duncan had tried to make her go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " S'pose I meets ' m on the stairs ? " she had asked . " But you ca n't now , " said Duncan . " Why ca n't I ? " " Because they are n't there . " " S'pose I meets ' m at the do ' ? " " But nobody 's outside . Look out there ; it 's empty . " " S'pose I meets ' m on the road ? " " You can see the road , too , in the streetlight . You can see nearly all the way around the courthouse . Nobody 's there . " " But when I gets to the turning of the road , what if I meets ' m there ? " Duncan had not answered . It would be just Lu 's luck to meet a pack of drunk Granthams , sure enough , and get hurt by mistake . " With they bob-wire whups , " Lu went on , " and they fat pine kindling wood . With they coal oil and they blow torches  --  " " Hush up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't you , it 's me , and anyway I understand that kind of thing is out of date . I hope somebody has told them so . " He sat angled a bit forward in the stiff little chair , keeping his weight off the corner where the cane had worn through . He had placed his hands one on either knee and the white bandages showed annoyingly clear in the dim light . He said to Duncan , " Why do n't you go downstairs with Mister Trewolla ? " " Mister Trewolla 's bedtime is nine o'clock . I let on I was justp102coming up to check on you , then going along home myself . " " You do n't want Mister Trewolla to think you 're casting aspersionson him , in other words . " " No more than I can help , " said Duncan . Lu had found an empty cigarette package in the corner , had spread it out carefully and was dismembering it , piece at a time , with her long picky fingers . You could hear the cellophane come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the printed paper , then the tinfoil . " I wonder where is Mister Kerney Woolbright , " Beck Dozer asked . Duncan did not answer . He got up , took a restless turn back past the cell doors , looked up the narrow circular stair that led up to the death cell , the cupola of the jail . " There ai n't a soul up here to help you , " said Beck . " In past time , or so I hear , white folks could raise a number just like each other to stick together on these things , but you ca n't even find one honest deputy . Either you is the only man around with principles , or everybody else is stitching their principles together out of a different bolt of goods . " " It so happens I 'm the only man that 's sheriff , " said Duncan , " and that I have n't tried to deputize . Now shut up . If there 's anything worse than Lu talking every minute , it 's you talking every minute . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jailyard , the streetlight glow of the hollow square , his own grocery an obscure ridge in the store line along the farther side . He was wondering himself what had happened to Kerney Woolbright . It was twelve midnight , as Beck Dozer had predicted , before they came . From the windows Beck and Duncan watched them get outp103of the ear , which had arrived stodgily , slushing through the puddles . They piled out endlessly , like the old clown act at the circus , and milled about , turning their big shoulders to the rain 's slant and swapping a word or two until a familiar figure came up wirily from behind the ignition and led them through the gate . By count there were only seven . Lu began to wail , like something way off in the woods before dawn on a clear spring night . The sound , mounting , became less mysterious and more like Lu . " Shut that up , " Duncan said . " I ca n't hear anything that 's going on . " But all she did was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stuck his face halfway through the bars . He spoke roughly . " It 's that kind of noise they wants out of a nigger . It 's what they 're waiting for you to do . It makes them feel good when you sound like that . It tells them they got you where they want you for another fifty , hundred , two hundred years . I says to shut up because I personally ca n't stand to listen to it , Lu Johnson . Nobodystudying you . You think Jesus done forgot you ? " " Jesus , " said Lu , and hushed suddenly . " He ai n't never forgot me yet , Brer Beck . " " Then set there and think about Him till I tells you you can quit . " In the quiet , voices rose to them from the hall below , brushing now and again a tender spot in the iron . Mr. Trewolla was at the door in his bathrobe , trying to explain things without his teeth . " Orders ith orders , " said Mr. Trewolla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I just want to talk to him , " said Jimmy Tallant . " Do n't you let him through that door , " Duncan called out from above . " I 've talked to him once tonight already . If he wants to talk again , I 'll come downstairs . " " You thee ? " said Mr. Trewolla.  |p104Some  things have come to light since I saw Duncan . Grantham'swilling to settle the whole thing with no harm done to anybody . I have to see the nigger too . Five minutes will settle it . Okay ? " Mr. Trewolla sneezed . " Okay , " said Jimmy Tallant . A large young Grantham boy beside him laid a shoulder to the door which Mr. Trewolla had cracked open to talk . The screws that held the chain-bolt locks fixed in the old wood wrenched free , splintering . " You better go put some socks on , Mr. Henry , " Jimmy Tallant advised , as he stepped inside . " You can catch cold mighty quick like that , especially this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called toward the ceiling . " In thpite of everything I could do  --  ! " " That 's okay , Mr. Henry , " Duncan answered , this time from behind the iron door at the head of the stair . " Just get on back in the back . " " You come back here to me , Daddy , " Mrs. Trewolla called . " You leave those awful people alone . " " It 's dog eat dog , " said Mr. Trewolla , going to obey Mrs. Trewolla . " Nothing in the world but likker-heads . If I 'd had my gun , now , but whisky'th , whisky , just like I always say . " " It 's a mighty brave man , " said Jimmy , " would come to meet six Granthams without even a beebee gun . Not to mention a Tallant . " The Granthams stood politely about in the hall like Granthamsinvited to a party in a stiff house . One said , " You would n't of thought he would of come to the front door without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did n't have no gun at all . None I seen anyway . " " Turn that light out , " Duncan said rapidly to Beck . " Here 's the key . That little winding stair there leads up to the death cell . They ca n't shoot at you there . Lock yourself in good . " He checked his automatic , and took his stand behind the door.  |p105The  bottom two-thirds of the door was solid iron , plated and bolted like the sides of a battleship , but the upper third was barred . Through the bars , looking down the stairs , which from the first landing upward narrowed to the width of a ladder , he saw Jimmy 's face surface toward him , pale against the dull iron gloss around about , and with that same distance in it he had noticed before , so that , rising steadily toward him , its distance increased  --  just as a star falling seems to be palpably near the earth the instant before it vanishes in space , or as a car hurtling out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it seems to still and then reverse , or as a dying face still retreats the closer down you bend to hear the words and stay the breath , or as a man turns from a rainy window to say , " My father did a public thing . " Then Beck switched out the light . Granthams came up the stairs , banging and clattering , and by the time the noise died Duncan could make out Jimmy 's features again , now nearer than ever in the dark . Down near the bottom two Granthams were talking to each other . They used to be just that way , Duncan recalled , when he went to school with them . They were always five grades behind and had never been known to finish out a school year , because they came to school only when cotton picking was done and before spring plowing started , always provided the hunting season was poor . So when the teacher lined the classes up after recess to march them inside through the halls , she did not even try to quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line shoving each other , marveling at the size of their own great big fists , bigger already than most men 's on the town square ever got to be , and the misery and terror of anything not Grantham or Grantham kin that crossed their path was the misery and terror of the Pygmy who got in the giant village by mistake and walked down the street apologizing all the way . A Grantham by himself could be docile , and sometimes discoveredsweetness and grew so good it would seem his own goodnesswas the only thing that amused him . So Granthams who got separated from other Granthams during the war came back fromp106the Army sometimes leading fine girls who looked proud to be their wives , and so they moved into town or into other towns , and so the tribe had thinned . But Granthams together were another matter . Somebody had wronged them once  --  perhaps a British king had gone too far . Whatever it was , it would n't happen again . Granthams were good as a king ; they were better than a nigger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " servant made them spit . Granthams left living back in the woods now had few friends except each other ; yet a man like Jimmy Tallant , who had shown those foreigners over there how to fight a war , had known who he wanted to be home with when they got through pinning the ribbons on him . Duncan recalled , too , that the day he had entered Camp Shelby , in the same bunch with himself was a boy who happened to fall in beside him after the sergeant had dismissed them . " I think I 'll go back to town , " said the boy . " Town ! " Duncan said . " Did n't you hear what he just said ? We ca n't go outside camp for two days . " " Yeah , well I just thought I 'd go in for a little while . I thought you might want to come . " Duncan stared , then laughed . " But you ca n't ! Do n't you know this is the Army ? You have to take orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flint in him . He regarded Duncan and a mild spark fell . " You do n't want to go , I 'll go ahead on by m'self , " he said , and walked away . They had considerable trouble with him before he would make up his bed the way they had in mind , or keep his effects the way the diagram wanted . It was n't that he did n't understand them . Jimmy Tallant said , " Y'all boys shut up down there . " " Y'all hush , " the Granthams said to one another . " I should have picked up the keys from Trewolla , " said Jimmy . " He has n't got them , " said Duncan . " They 're all on my side of the fence . " " I was prepared for that , " said Jimmy . " Hey , Lewis ! Are you ready with that blowtorch ? " " I 'm ready , Cud'n Jimmy . "  | " I 've got a gun , " Duncan said , " and I aim to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Whereabouts is your gun ? " Jimmy Tallant inquired . " Right here in my hand . " " Everybody knows that Duncan Harper tells the truth . It 's why he made so many touchdowns . Are you ready there , Lewis ? " " Ready , Jimmy ! " " Okay , then , shoot ! " A single brilliant flare illumined the whole interior , and Lu shrieked once from the cell . The night that Duncan Harper felt duty-bound to go sit in the jail and protect that nigger that had been in England during the war , naturally nobody wanted to get mixed up in it . Still , along about eleven-thirty with the town as quiet as snow , a good many people got restless and drove up to the jail . They stopped in the street where they could watch from a distance , and sat in their cars ; and some rode by time and again , asking what had happened . Probably nobody thought that there would be any trouble , else they would not have brought their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took Cissy Hunt straight home . Marcia Mae was out on the porch swing in the cold , and insisted on riding up to the jail with him . Cissy was prevailed upon to come inside the house , but it was accepted in the family that nobody could do anything with Marcia Mae . She wore loafers and a slouchy raincoat with a hood and sat in the corner of the back seat . She had been walking in the rain , she said , and was wet . She assailed Kerney with certain remarks . " Wonder what his wife is doing all this time ? " " Whose wife ? "  | " Duncan 's . " " Oh , Tinker , you mean . She 's home with the children , I 'd think . " " Has she changed much ? " " You have n't seen her ? " " No . " " I expect she 's just as she always was . " " A real cute girl , " said Marcia Mae . He drove around the corner without replying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcia Mae went on . " What 's she like ? " " She 's like herself , " said Kerney . " There 's nobody quite the same . " Marcia Mae would have thought that out of all the average American-looking girls she had ever seen , Tinker Taylor was the most average American-looking of them all , but she recognized the rebuff and took it . Maybe Cissy ought to marry Kerney , after all , she thought idly . He had spoken up like a man . They drew up across from the jail , on the side of the street next to the courthouse , at a little distance from the other cars . Watching across the rainy yard toward the jail , they saw when the windows blazed blue-white , heard the woman scream , and saw the windows light a second time .... As a matter of fact , the light was a flash bulb . Duncan recognized it instantly for what it was , because they had once gone off in his face all the time . Duncan Harper 's life had taken an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under extremepressures toward action , he could reason through any numberof possibilities and choose one with as much leisure as he might choose lunch from a menu , and all in the five seconds it was said to take a good tackle to rush the backfield . They said that from the stands he seemed not to be moving at all , that he looked dazed or maybe just lazy , as if he might yawn . Then the pass would bep109aloft and landing , or you would glimpse his heels rounding right end . So when he was standing back of the door with the gun in his hand and Jimmy Tallant said " Shoot ! " and the flash bulb went off , he realized he had the best opportunity anybody could ask for killing Jimmy Tallant . He could have said for the rest of his life that he had thought the flash was gunfire . He knew now too that Jimmy wanted himself shot ; he understood now the strange distanceshe had noted before in the face which as the light glared pressed upward closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunging toward twelve inches of water in a dishpan . But Duncan did not fire . He would hardly have killed anybody , even someone he despised , and he did not despise Jimmy . A second bulb went off . When Lu 's cry died in the iron , there came the splintering of the tiny bulbs , dropped on the hall floor below . After that , they all went away . They filed out the jail door in the dark , tramped through the cinders , and loaded into the muddy car . ' When they entered the square from the jail drive and saw cars massed silently in the rain , one of the Granthams leaned from the window and fired a pistol . He may have thought he was shooting straight up , and the car lurched , or he may have had his wrist deflectedby the narrow opening of the window ; however it happened , the bullet went low and broke the ventilation window in one of the parked cars . In passage it sang a tune in several ears and , dying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Grantham , when he fired , had sounded the high-pitched exulting yell that some people say is the old Rebel yell . If anybody had asked him why he fired the shot , he would have said that something came over him . Anyway , before whatever it was came over him and he leaned out and yelled and fired , the people in Lacey who were watching were as ready as Mr. Trewolla to speculate unfavorably on the subject of Duncan Harper . But then the bullet made its little music , and they remembered what dangerous people Granthams reallyp110were . The man who got his ventilator window broken had his wife and grandbaby with him . Granthams were lawless and bad . Nobody left . They all sat waiting after the load of Granthams had screamed away through the rain : you could hear the gears mesh a half mile away on the long drag running outward toward the highway . Still they waited . When Duncan 's car at last drew out of the jailyard , some of the townsmen alighted to stop him . He stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lights in the nearer cars flashed on , and he was plain there in the crossbeams , his fair hair feathery under a bright crust of rain . He had won again . It was easy to idealize Duncan Harper . He was never proud ; you could not spoil him . He was fine yet familiar-looking . He seemed to present no complicated problem . It seemed he always felt just what a person ought to feel . That night when he stepped out into the eyes of Lacey , ranked behind the black car-hoods and rain-glazed windows , he stepped for a second time in heroism . Then Kerney Woolbright had crossed the street and was drawinghim aside . " It 's time you came , " Duncan complained . " What in hell happened to you ? " " I had to get hold of the Humphreys County sheriff and talk him into coming over . I figured if nobody in Lacey would take sides , we ought to have help from somewhere . " " When I was up there waiting for God knows what , I doubted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kerney . " He put out his hand impulsively , and Kerney grasped it . " What did Tallant want ? " Kerney asked . " What was that light ? " " They took two pictures , " Duncan said . " That 's all . " " Pictures ? Of you , of the Negro , of what ? " " When I heard them coming inside , I told the Negro to get himself upstairs to the death cell and lock the door ; then there was so much racket I did n't hear him go . When the flash wentp111off , I noticed him standing there by me , just a little to the back . " " Then you think it 's one of Tallant 's concoctions . " " Yes , and I half suspect the Negro of being in on it . He wasnervous , but not scared enough . He kept talking too much . " " But what will they do with the pictures ? " Kerney asked . " We 'll have to wait and see . " A car roared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splashing mud . It was McCutcheon , the Humphreys County sheriff , enormous in his custom-built trousers . He heaved himself out of the front seat and struggled erect to meet Duncan . Standing , he propped himself up on a stout short walking stick . Two deputies were with him . They remarked that in time past Travis would have asked them in the office and offered them a drink , but they understood everything was changed . They said people in Winfield County had to pick a nigger fight every once in a while these days in place of getting drunk . The Lacey crowd had thinned by the time they drove away . Duncan followed Kerney to his car and sat inside for a moment , out of the rain . " So what about the Negro ? " Kerney asked . " It 's custody he asked for , and he 's going to get it . " " No excitement after all , " said Marcia Mae . Duncan had not noticed her before and he started , turning , and saw her emerging from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even taken for a person . She was shaking back the clumsy raincoat hood from her bright hair . " Since nobody else will lynch him , let 's go lynch him our-selves . " The men were silent . Her confident Hunt voice , with the smoky tint it had always held , framed now and again a Yankee crispness on a word , reminding them of her life 's distance since ten years ago  --  no , nothing that happened here could seem important to her . Duncan pointed toward the courthouse whose upper story rose whitely into the rain , while out beyond , whiter still , the **25;9988;TOOLONG soldier 's statue held a stern guard toward the North . " Upstairs there , " he scolded her , " twelve Negroes were shot down in cold blood . " " When was that ? " she asked . " Nineteen-nineteen , " said Kerney , " or was it twenty ? Somewherealong in there . " " Oh , " she laughed . " I thought you meant last year . " " You 've heard about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , now that you mention it . I 've heard it and forgotten it because I do n't care . If I do n't care nobody cares . I 'm no different from anybody else . Nobody our age in town could say offhand who was there or why . " " Jimmy Tallant 's father was there , " said Kerney , " for one . " " Yes , " said Duncan , " and Beck Dozer 's father , for another . " Kerney whistled . " They both knew it , " Duncan went on . " Tallant would do a toe dance around a volcano . I could have shot him by mistake tonightwhen the flash went off in my face . It looks to me he 's been trying to die for years . " " I wish , " said Marcia Mae , " that I was anybody 's secretary in some big city . And that every morning I got up and put on a gray suit and a clean white blouse and went to work in a beautiful soundproof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streamlined filing cabinets and a noiseless electric typewriter . I wish I had a little apartment with a view from the window of nothing but skyscraper tops . Then I would be happy . " " No , you would n't , " Duncan said . Now all the cars had gone away but theirs . They were left with the old square . The two streetlights bleared in the wet . The last car , disappearing , jolted in a rut by the filling station . Its taillightdescribed the corner . Then it was nothing . " Why would n't I be happy ? " she demanded . " You 'd have to get up early every morning , for one thing . For another , you 'd get bored . "  |p113Kerney  felt that the two of them were alone in the car , that he was not there at all . " So many things are boring nowadays , " she said . " Why is that ? " " It 's part of getting old , " said Duncan . " I take it hard . Harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know whether you do or not , " he answered . If any one household was most afflicted by the new law enforcementprinciples in Winfield County , it was Duncan Harper 's . On ' Saturday nights , as Tinker had predicted , people no longer wanted to stop and talk . Wednesday-night trips to the next county for bingo had to go as well . And Jimmy Tallant never came . After the heavy rains , the sun had come out and discovered a jungle . To human beings it seemed that their bodies had got involved in the rich growth ; thinking went laboriously  --  the mind seemed to work like a motor under too great a dredge of oil . Vines drew the fences down to earth , and the leaves on every kind of growing thing looked too large , like an elephant ear . It had also become suddenly hot . Down on the terrace just back of the house , Tinker found that grass had forced up overnight between the bricks . She went down on Sunday afternoons with her trowel and scissors , working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patsy , freshly out of her winter overalls , ran miniature errands for her , talking a blue streak . The work seemed an excuse for getting out of doors and for meetingSunday by doing a thing that was not everyday . For Sunday , whether you have a hangover or not , is a restless time . There is the thing that Saturday night held out to you and never quite gave , but there is no use complaining to Sunday . It is stone deaf , and does not even know your name.  |p114Earlier  , Duncan had taken his son for a walk in the woods . The boy , who was around ten , had hair so blond as to be white , and for this reason they all called him Cotton . He was sailing comfortably into the future under his father 's banners ; it had been impressed upon him early that he was not to talk about football outside the family . Usually nobody in the family wanted to talk about it either , but at the moment he was enjoying a day of grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barbed-wire fence , that he had changed his life 's ambition to being a big-league baseball pitcher , instead of a football star . " Why ? Do you like baseball better than football ? " " No , I still like football best . But there 's already a Harper that 's an All-Time Great in football . I want to be an All-Time Great in something else . I thought baseball would be the next best thing . Then when Patsy grows up , she could be a girls ' tennis champion . If Mother has another little boy , he could  --  let 's see , what could he do ? " " Track , maybe ? " " I do n't like track . It 's not a game . " " Swimming ? " " That 's no game either . Maybe basketball . Lightweight people are good in basketball . " " Why is he going to be so lightweight ? " " Because he 'll be so little . " " What makes you think Mother wants another little boy ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Duncan sat down . They had gained the middle of a roll of pasture underneath a bluff . The cows had cropped the grass short there . He leaned back on the hillside in the sun . " Mother would n't let you do that , " said the boy . " You 'd catch cold . " " But Mother is n't here . Wo n't I still catch cold ? " The boy caught on and laughed . " I do n't know . " " We used to find Indian arrowheads on this hill . " " Who did ? "  | " Oh , your mother and I. " " Was she your girl friend , Daddy ? " " Of course she was . " " Your girl friend all the time ? " " Most of the time . " " You had another girl friend besides Mother ! " But these matters did not really interest him . He had begun to tumble about on the hillside like a puppy , making foolish noises . " Do n't adt silly , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch . " " Can I carry the shotgun ? " " You know I 've told you a hundred times . You can not carry the shotgun . " " Maybe Mother could have two more children , " said Cotton . " Oh ? What 's the fourth one for ? " " ' Well , ice sports are real important some places . Not around here because there is n't any ice , but up North they are . This would make a good ski jump , if there was ever any ice on it . It would make a good place for a swing . " " A swing ! Who told you that ? " " Nobody . I just thought of it . " " That 's funny . There used to be a swing here . Right from that big tree limb . " " Let 's build one here again sometime . " " We ca n't . It is n't our land . " " Whose land is it ? " " Let 's go down this path , " said his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the branch from the pasture . The path down to the watering ford was cleft two feet deep or more into the bank , chopped in slowly by the hooves of cattle . A muscle of current curved into the shaggy bank . Duncan and Cotton jumped to an island of sand , then across the stream . They sat down on the sandy farther bank . The small sound of the current filled the open space between the stream and a thicket of willows . " We used to build dams here , " Duncan said.  | " Dam is an ugly word . You said an ugly word . " " Would you like to build a dam ? " " You said another  --  " " Cotton , I told you to stop acting silly . " Stricken by his father 's sudden change of tone , the child tried hard not to cry , and finally succeeded . They often said to him on such occasions : " Be a man , do n't cry . " He now said this to himself , and found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , " said Duncan . " When you want to stop acting silly , start doing something . Now thinlc of something you can do . " " All right , I 've thought of something . " " What is it ? " " Go wading . " " Good , we 'll both go wading . " They both removed their shoes and socks , and laid them up on the grass , away from the sand . Duncan unloaded the gun and put it down on his coat . The water was chilly and only the top crust of sand was warm . The boy 's feet were still tender from having gone shod through the long wet spring . His toes curled at the touch of the water . Duncan rolled up his pants legs and splashed across and slightly upstream to where an old fence post lay on the higher bank . He loosened it from one end , lifting it as though from its grave , for an outer strip of it had rotted into the earth . Black bugs shot away into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture at the sudden sunlight . Duncan observed this for a moment , then he laid the post in the water , across the narrowest neck of the branch . " What 's that for ? " asked the boy . " Go on and wade , " said Duncan . " I 'm going to build a dam . " He scooped out a ditch in the stream 's bed , laid the post there and leveed it in place with dripping handfuls of sand . Then he began to bring heavy damp sand from the bank . Presently the water downstream ceased splashing . Cotton was standing near him to watch . Drops of bright water fell from his fingertips . Little drying rims of sand had formed on his legs.  | " Can I help you , Daddy ? " " No , thank you . " " Please , Daddy . " His father straightened and they grinned at each other , understanding the game . " I thought you did n't want to build a dam . I thought you 'd rather wade . " " I changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can help me . " They both began to carry sand in double handfuls , holding it out before them like bowls too full of something . The water backed up gradually behind the dam . It hunted patiently , found the weakest place , and struck through . " It wo n't hold , " said Cotton , staunching it desperately . " I saw some rocks over yonder a little way . And some chunks of log from an old pigpen . " Duncan pointed . " Oh boy ! We could build a big dam with those . " " Sure we could . " " Let 's go . " Cotton began to run . " Wait a'minute . Listen . This will be good . You get the rocks and the wood and build one up here and I 'll go down the branch a little piece just around the corner there and build another one . When it all backs up good and strong , you can break this one and make a real flood . Then you can run down to where I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that be fine ? That is , if you do n't mind working hard . " " I do n't mind working . I like it . I can beat you finished . " " Do n't forget to leave your spillway running right up to the last . You saw what happened before . " " I wo n't ! " He ran again . " When I 'm almost through I 'll holler . " " Holler loud . And wait till I answer you . You hear ? " " Okay . I 'll holler real loud . " He was hard at work already , trustworthy , concentrated , and happy . Under the sun that fell on the ruined pigpen , his white hair grew hot as glass . A tuft would not lie down at the crown . He did not hesitate to tackle heavy loads of rock and logs . Thep118big thing was that he and his father were working together . This knowledge , like the sound of the branch , filled the open space he moved in , and more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality . He did not feel it when his legs and arms got tired . He enjoyed majestic securities . He laid the last stone , sealing the spillway . The dam was an austere production , tough with stone and thatchings of wood , packed in with wet sand and firmed across the top . He had worked for an hour . He stood straight and called his father . After he had called several times , he realized the truth . His father was playing a joke on him . The water mounted imperceptibly behind the dam , which was holding well . He ran downstream . When he burst through the plum thicket , a new reach of the branch curved before him . There was another ford , muddy and pocked with hoofprints , and far over to the left a fence corner and a wet brown field beyond , empty and taking Sunday . Besides these , there was only a confusion of new leaves up the bank to his right , and a silence full of birds . There had never been the start of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out ! It 's ready ; stop hiding ! " He did not know how many times he raced back and forth , people being always foolish as children when they are betrayed , and children being very foolish indeed . He was suddenly frightened , and returning at a walk through the thicket , he began to cry . Then he stopped dead still . His father was sitting on the higher bank beside the path that they had followed down from the pasture above . He was staring at the boy . The dam still held , but the water had backed up behind it in a pool and begun to swirl . Duncan sat with his head lowered . There was green stain on his cheek and pressed into his hair , and his clothes were twisted strangely . " Were you there all the time , Daddy ? " There was no answer , and Cotton wondered for a terrible minute if this man was his father at all . He pulled a weed and began miserably to peel it . The water struck free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded.  | " I built it real good , " said Cotton . When the water made the noise it made , the man seemed to come to himself . With an athlete 's decision of movement , he jumped from the bank and cleared the stream and , bending , swung the child affectionately against him . " It was a wonderful dam , " he said . " It was the best I ever saw . " " But where was yours , Daddy ? " " You know when I went down around the corner ? Well , there was a man came by who wanted me to help him head his cow back to the pasture . We had to climb all up through the woods . I 'm sorry I had to leave you by yourself . Let 's go home now . " They put on their shoes and walked back . Duncan shot the gun twice to amuse him . On the way they stopped by Duncan 's mother 's , the house that was low in front but tall in the back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back yard . They all three sat together on the steps and ate teacakes out of a crock . ' When they reached home , Tinker was not long in discoveringthat Cotton had fever and had to be put to bed . " You should n't have let him go wading , " said Tinker . " It 's May , " Duncan said . " I know , but you know what a late spring we 've had , and the water was still cold , I bet . I bet you let him sit on the wet ground too and probably let him get too hot dragging all that stuff around in the sun . You ought to think about things like that when I 'm not there . " The little girl began to sneeze . " I guess that 's my fault too , " said Duncan . " No , it 's my fault . I took her down with me to weed the terrace , and the brick is still clamp . " She turned away from the sink . There was a cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she dried her hands on it , found a piece of Kleenex and blew the child 's nose . Later , after she had put them both to bed in the twilight , Duncan'smother telephoned and told her how Duncan had come by with Cotton and they had sat on the back steps eating teacakes , what Duncan had said , what she had said , what Cotton had said.  |p120She  lived alone and appreciated every little attention , and she was always wanting to remind Tinker of this . Tinker hung up the phone . The twilight in the house , wide open to the outdoors , had just passed gold . The free Sunday quiet of the light called up the love of innocence in her heart , and with it the ritualist 's faith in the innocent trappings of the day : a walk in the woods , playing at the branch , a visit to Grandmother 's , children . I 'm foolish and wrong , she confessed to herself , not to trust what I know I can trust . Duncan , she thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . She looked in on the children . Tired from the day outside , Cotton slept already , an arm flung wildly out , and Patsy whispered something , as she was apt to do , and shut her eyes again . Tinker closed the door softly . She moved through the filmy light in the hallway and saw how every pretty thing she had cast its long gracefulshadow . From the threshhold of the living room she saw Duncanon the couch . His sleeping hand hung toward the floor . She knelt and unbuckled her sandals and , stepping free of them , went and sat on the bit of couch beside him . She unbuttoned his shirt and was about to lay her head down when she saw the red mark in the skin itself , and beside it the lipstick stain . From long habit , out of even so deep a sleep , he threw his arm up around her , and she dropped down to the floor with a little moan . " It 's happened , " said Kerney Woolbright . He stood in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mattie Sue Bainbridge having gone across the street for her morningCoke . He looked up from the desk at Kerney once , then taking greater care , he looked again . " What 's happened ? "  | " It 's come out , " said Kerney . " After two months . I kept wondering . I guess you have too . " " I do n't know what you mean . What are you talking about ? " Kerney tossed a newspaper open before him on the desk . It was a Chicago paper for Negroes ; the outer pages were pink . Negroeswere always sending the white people 's laundry back wrapped in pages of this paper , or others like it , as if they had n't thought what they were doing or there was n't any other paper around the house . " There 's a picture of you inside , " said Kerney , " in quite a prominent position  --  the one they took in the jail . You 've got a gun in your hand and Beck Dozer is behind you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nice to hear , " said Duncan . " Also , " Kerney went on , " there is an article here about you . It tells how proud everybody ought to be of you , born and raised in Mississippi and yet defending a Nee-grow . Nobody can understand it , but they all think it is wonderful . You are a champion of civil rights , you are a defender of the black race . In Chicago , friend , you are solid . In Winfield County you 'll probably be everybody 's least favorite grocer till the day you die . " " Lone hero , ' " Duncan read , " ' in a gallant defense of a haplessNegro  --  ' " Nee-grow. ' " " ' ... falsely suspected of a minor offense against a local cafe owner , Sheriff Duncan Harper of Winfield County , Mississippi , successfully turned away from the cell door an angry lynch mob .... ' " " I always said , " Kerney remarked , " that you were everybody 's hero . " " Oh , shut up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article . " " They have reporters all over the South , " said Kerney . " Tallant may have written it himself . " " It 's signed . Cuthbert Owsley . ' What a name ! It sounds likep122a Tallant-type invention . How else would they get the names , the dates , all the details ? But we ca n't go on guesswork . We have to know . " " The trouble with that is , it takes time , and we have n't got the time to waste . The first thing to do is to hit back good and strong . Buy space in the paper , or print a handbill and show Tallantup for what he is . " " I ca n't accuse him without knowing . " " You do n't have to accuse . You can insinuate . I 'll write it , or rather we can do it together . You can suggest that Tallant bribed the nigger to pose for the picture , then sent the story in . You know that 's the size of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan shook his head . " I 've got to know first . When I walk back across to the grocery store , I want to go with my shoes clean . " " You got in trouble before by not listening to me , " said Kerney . " You were n't born and raised in Winfield County , Kerney . You would n't know a lot of people around here as well as you do if it had n't been for me . The Hunts , for instance . I gave you a good name with Mr. Jason . " Kerney stood undecided . " You 're saying we ought to stick to-gether . " " I 've always thought we had the same feeling about things . If I 'm wrong , why then  --  " " You are n't wrong ; we do . " " I 'm willing to risk losing a race to  --  " " But that 's just it ! " Kerney cried with a sudden lost wild boyishness . " It does n't matter to you ! " His picture , labeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the telephonepoles . He recovered quickly and , stepping toward the desk , laid his hand palm down between them . It was a long-fingered , thin hand , the kind that held the pen that was mightier than the sword . " I 've got to have this county 's record , Duncan . " " I want to see you win , " said Duncan . " I 'll do everything possible to see that you do , that we both do . " " If Tallant and Grantham get back in the saddle  --  "  | " Are you sure you 've counted all my cards ? Tallant is the brains there , and I wonder if he really wants to lick me . " They looked at one another , and both of them thought of Tinker . " Meanwhile , " Duncan continued , pointing to the paper , " I 'll have to work this out in my own way , Kerney . " Mattie Sue Bainbridge came back . " Miss Winfield County Courthouse , " said Kerney , " of 1950 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sue wrinkled up her mouth and blushed . " You 're the craziest thing ! " she said . " Give me a piece of tablet paper , Mattie Sue , " Duncan said , when Kerney had disappeared . He bent over the paper at the small desk by the window , writing laboriously with his left hand. " dear Mr. Editor : I am a negroe in Wingfeeld county , Mississippi , who wish to get in tuch with the man who sent in the peice which tell about mister Duncan Harper our sherriff . You say the man is name mister Cuthbert Owsley , but there is not a man of this name in Wingfeeld . It is important to some of us negroes because we have made up a club ( secret ) for our civil rites and wishes to find all who will help us . Yours truely , A. P. Abbott . " He sent Mattie Sue to the post office with the letter along with a note to the postmistress to put any mail for A. P. Abbott in the sheriff 's box . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the nom de plume of one of our valued correspondents in your area . His name is Mr. Beckwith Dozer . We wish you great success with your civil rights organization . " Duncan read it over twice and a pair of eyes seemed to be regarding him out of gold-rimmed glasses . " This does n't make any sense at all , " he thought and , catching up his straw hat , went out to find Beck Dozer.  |p124Duncan  drove to the tie plant , but it was shut down for the day , so he followed first one side road , then another , until he reached the mailbox with " Dozer " written on it . The ink had bleared under the " Z. " He left his car on the road , close in beside the'bank , and climbed the narrow dusty path where a child had been playing with spoons and snuff bottles . The house was a plain two-wing country house with a hall down the middle and a gable to the right . Once at the top of the bluff above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatly back into the wood behind . The fence around the front yard was fancy calf wire that had seen better days ; the front gate was weighted with a plowshare . No one was in sight , yet the sense of human presence lay strong everywhere , as in the old story of the ship that is found empty at sea . Duncan minded his country manners and stood by the gate , calling . " Anybody home ? " " Home ? ' " said the wood behind the house . A tiny black boy scampered across the open hall . Someone moved inside the gabled window . In the back yard a dog barked and would presently trot around the corner of the house , stand in the front path , and bark again . Duncan waited . After so long Beck Dozer emerged into the hall and came directly down the steps . " Git away , " he said to the dog . He wore new overalls and an old work shirt that clung to his small shoulders . " I 've come to ask who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chicago paper in his hand . " You already know , " returned Beck . " Do n't you ? " " Then I have another question too . " " Go ahead . " They talked across the gate , standing equal distance backp125from it , not lounging against it as two white men might when they talk together , but looking straight into each other 's eyes , and Duncan commenced to see the advantage of Beck 's glasses . " What crazy streak makes you do business with a man like Jimmy Tallant who does n't give a damn if all the niggers in Winfield County get wiped out one way or another as long as he has a free hand on Highway 8a ? " " Mister Tallant and I are tied together on account of what his daddy did to mine . He would n't lose me , nor let me come to harm for anything in this world . He 's my main protection in this life . That and he pays me for what he gets me to do . He 's paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night I was up at the jail with you . That 's what he gave me for it . " " So how did you really get your hands cut ? " " That was the only hard part . I did it myself on somebody 's new bob wire . " " These Chicago articles  --  what are you trying to do with them ? " " They pay pretty good too . I gave you a good enough name , did n't I ? " " You gave me such a good name you as good as lifted me out of the sheriff 's race , and you damn well know it . If you 're trying to help your people  --  " " I do n't run in pack , Mister Harper . I 'm not trying to help anybody but me . I said that when I came on back down here to live after the war was over . Any Negro with little enough sense to choose to come back to Mississippi to live , had better hew his own road and not look to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call yourself doing ? " " It 's what I does . " " I do n't believe a word of it , " said Duncan with such force the Negro fell silent . " You 've seen a light these days , " Duncan went on . " All of you have . You keep casting around for the best way . You want to deal equally with white men but you do n't know who to trust.  |p126You  'd rather have Mr. Willard Follansbee in office instead of me ? " " To be honest with you , Mister Harper , I prefer the status quo . You can climb the status quo like a step ladder with two feet on the floor , but trying to trail along behind a white man of good will is like following along behind somebody on a tightrope . As he gets along towards the middle his problems are likely to increase , and soon he gots to turn loose of me to help himself . " " I stayed with you at the jail , " Duncan reminded him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You were the one cheating that night , not me . " " I remember . " He stood blinking for a moment , then he opened the gate . " If you 'd care to step inside the yard a minute , Mister Harper , there 's something I 'd like to show you . " To their right , tall althea bushes framed a path that led down to a house scarcely larger than a privy . Beck unlocked the door and pushed it wide . Duncan looked in on a square room where two long hand-hewn benches and two tables faced a raised platformwith a desk and chair . Behind , a blackboard was set neatly into the wall . The three remaining walls were lined with bookshelves , these giving way only to the windows . From an iron stove in the far corner came the scent of coal dust . " I lights a fire in here every so often during the winter . They tell me damp is not good for books . " Duncan glanced over the shelves . They held mainly leatherboundsets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authors he had heard of somewhere ; memories stirred in him of vague desires he had once felt to know what these very books said . His own reading had been largely in the English and Americanbooks his professors had talked about most , and later in modern books that Kerney was apt to like mentioning . And he remembered , too , one night in summer sitting in the porch swing with Marcia Mae , how Nan Hunt had come out to bring them coconut cake and fresh peach ice cream she had taken for them ahead of time out of the freezer , salt-packed for Sunday . Theyp127begged her to stay and talk to them , and somehow the talk turned to reminiscence  --  somehow she had come to say , her voice very sweet , " I wonder what happened to the old library Senator Upinshawgave to Robinson Dozer when he died ? I suppose they must have destroyed it when they killed Robinson . A thing like that knows no bounds . " " They left the library , then , " Duncan said to Beck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that to myself , " said Beck . " At least they left his books the Senator gave him . At least they could n't touch the books . But you know , Mister Harper , it finally came to me why they had n't done it . You know why ? They did n't do it because they did n't care . " " Can you read these books ? " Duncan asked . " No . Can you ? " " No . " " You are the first white man I ever showed the inside to . " " You 're the first Negro I ever invited to my house to talk business with . I need your help . " " Help for what ? " " I want to expose how Tallant got that picture . I want you to be in on it . " Halfway to the gate they stopped . The Negro grew cold right in the sun and shook . He could not answer the white man with any poise , so he stood noticing the sights of the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; wood smoke came from the washpot out back along with the slap of a sheet being pounded on the board ; jaybirds screamed in an oak tree down near the road . The dog slept , sprawled in the sun . A little naked Negro boy came out the door and halfway down the front steps , where he squatted like a savage . " Git back in the house , " Beck told him . " What you mean outdoors without your clothes ? " He turned finally to Duncan . " I tell you , Mister Harper , you are the only white man to see inside my papa 's school , but Misterp128Jimmy Tallant knows it 's there because he asked me once what it was . I think maybe he 's thought too , So they left the books , and then I think maybe he 's gone on to think , They left them because they did n't care . Mister Tallant and I , we 're yoked up together , you might say . There is n't anything one of us thinks that the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got to belong to some white man . " " You believe that ? " " No , " said Beck , and sighed . " I wo n't force you to come , " said Duncan , " or pay you anything for doing it . " " Lord knows , the Granthams will have my hide on the door before night come , if I do this . " " I count on Mr. Tallant , " said Duncan . " I do n't think he'lI let them hurt you . " " You do n't think ! It 's not you , it 's me ! " " It might be me ! It could be me ! Do n't you know it might come to that ? " " All right then . I 'll come . " When the gate stood between them again , Beck asked him , " Why you wants to act like this , Mister Harper ? " and one of his dark cheeks gleamed wet , smeared down from the gold rim of his glasses lens . " No reason , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , I guess . That 's all . " The slight Negro stood watching the big genial figure of the white man descending the steep path with paced , confident control of motion , and he felt his unease deepen . In a country where the motives for doing things are given names like honor , pride , love , family , greed , passion , revenge , and hatred , " right " had an odd inadequate sound . Beck shivered again in the smooth sunlight and thought that he had warmed the books so carefully and now needed warmth himself . He entered the house and there sat his wife 's grandmother , Granny ( Aunt Mattie , the white folks called her ) , drawn up to a little low fire.  | " Granny , are the Harpers Yankees ? " He had struck a moment when her mind was clear . " No , son , dey 's here all along . Dey 's cu'us , dat dey is , but dey ai n't Yankees . " " Cu'us how ? " " Jes ' cu'us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Duncan 's done him a do , " said Jason Hunt . They had sat out on the lawn since supper and now it was dark , and their shapes in the wicker chairs scarcely impressed another shadow . But they saw each other clearly , through long knowledge . Kerney was there , his long legs stretched out in the grass , elbows propped on the chair arms , fingers laced . From time to time , with the toe of his shoe he scratched his leg where a mosquito bit him , or a gnat . The gnats were getting worse . Nan Hunt kept a Flit gun beside her and sprayed every few minutes . It was the only time of year , she said , when she approved of her daughters ' smoking . " But you smoke yourself , " said Marcia Mae finally . Everybody had waited so long for somebody to say this , there did n't have to be any answer . Old Mrs. Standsbury , sitting erect with her thick short legs crossed , said , " Yes , she certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night air and kept her hands thrust in the folds . She wore a diamond pin low at her throat , which was soft as a girl 's . " You tell them about it , Grand , " said Jason , using the children'sname for her . He had had in him a love for her growing many years . There would never be any need to mention it . He sometimes thought of it as the most satisfying force in his life . " I never wanted any of my children to smoke , " the old lady said , " but they all did it anyway . " " Just like Cissy , " said Kerney , wanting her name in it.  | " Huh ? " said Cissy , who had not been listening . She knew she was sitting just beyond where Kerney would have liked her . He wanted to hear her breath , or graze her arm as though by accident when he raised his hand . A little out from the rest , in a loose peasant skirt , one knee hugged against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair , a huddle , darker than the others . " You approve of how he 's handled it , sir ? " Kerney asked . " Duncan ? Yes , I approve in general . I think he might have done it quicker . I think he might have talked to me , to somebody older . " " I talked to you , you remember , " Kerney said . " I remember . But Duncan  --  he never comes to me . " " Must he ? " Nan Hunt inquired . The edge was in her voice . " Apparently not , " said Jason , dryly . " What did he do ? " Cissy asked . " I 've told you three times , " said Kerney . " You do n't listen . " " I 'll listen now , " she said . " What did Duncan do ? " " Oh , Lord , " said Marcia Mae . " You do n't ever read the papers ? " her mother asked her . " I read the funny papers , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she insisted . " Grand does n't know either . " " Do you know , Mother ? " Nan asked , raising her voice . " Know what ? " She was a little deaf . " About what Duncan did . " " The piece in the paper , you mean ? " " That 's right . " " What did she say ? " " I said yes . The piece in the paper . " " Certainly I know . I read the paper every day . " " She keeps up , " said Jason . " Well , you children wo n't let me cook or work in the yard with Jonas . I have to do something . I ca n't crochet all day long . " " There , Mother . You 're exactly right . " " Of course , she 's right , " said Jason.  | " For crying out loud , " said Cissy . " Will somebody tell me  --  " " Yes , somebody will tell you , " said Jason , " but where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go back to when Duncan was born , " said Marcia Mae . " Then you 'd better tell her , " said Nan . " You 'd know more about that than anyone else . " But Marcia Mae fell silent , and Kerney at once commenced relating : " It was just after Duncan closed up the highway place  --  now you must remember hearing about that , Cissy  --  there was a Negro named Beck Dozer came to him and asked for custody , claiming he 'd got in a fight with Bud Grantham and Bud was sure to get him . It was raining like hell and Duncan could n't locate anybody but Jimmy Tallant , who claimed they 'd taken Bud back up in the hills , maybe to die . Duncan shut the Negro up in jail , but old Trewolla 's not the most forceful character in the world , and Duncan was n't easy in his mind . He did n't want either to sound the alarm over nothing , so he just stayed up in the jail with the Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , walked right by Trewolla and were heading upstairs for the Negro when Duncan stopped them . At that point , they shot two pictures with a flash bulb and went away . " " That was the night , " said Jason , " that one of the Granthams fired a gun out of pure devilment and almost hit old Morris 's grandbaby . " " That 's right . And the night I brought Cissy home early from the picture show in Clark . " " I remember that . It was raining . " " Yes . Then finally , the picture of Duncan and the Negro in the jailhouse comes out in a Chicago Negro paper , the kind they 're sending out all over the South now , with an article saying Duncan is a defender of the colored . Come to find out the whole show was a put-up job  --  there never was a fight with Grantham ,  |p132and  Dozer was paid a fat fee for his part in it . This lays the carpet for Follansbee to walk into office . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that kind . " " He likes to play games , " said Jason . " It amuses him . " " Why could n't Duncan just tell everybody how it all happened ? " Cissy asked . " Because in politics , " said Marcia Mae , " everybody agrees to confuse a perfectly simple issue that everybody understands . " " No , " said Jason , " that is eventually what Duncan did do , Cissy , but he had to tell it in some forceful way , in print . He came out with a paid political statement in last Sunday 's paper , containing along with his own statement a sworn statement by Beckwith Dozer . Is that nigger still alive , Kerney ? " " So far as I know , sir . " " He wo n't be living here much longer , then , " said Jason . " Duncan also stated , " Kerney continued , " that he was not the willing subject of comment from any outside group , that as long as he was sheriff he was managing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the size of it , " said Jason . " I suppose he 'll run it again when the campaign heats up and they start circulating that picture and the Chicago article as handbills . " " There 's going to be money poured in against Duncan , " Kerney said . " From who ? " Cissy asked . " Who indeed ! " Nan said . " People who want to sell whisky in Winfield County . " " Then Duncan will have to circulate handbills , " said Jason , " reprints of his article , and the whisky people will go in with the Chicago Negro people to circulate more handbills denying Duncan'shandbills , and the beer people will go in with the Baptist Church , only the Baptists wo n't know it 's the beer people , and circulate handbills saying Keep Whisky out of Winfield County , and Tallant will still make money because somehow or other on election day with everything shut up tighter than Dick 's hatband ,  |p133everybody  is going to contrive to get "  --  he slapped a mosquito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have my objections to Duncan , " he went on , " and always have had ; still he 's a decent sort of fellow , and I hate to see him get lost in this sort of mess . " " Is n't there a chance he wo n't get so lost as you think ? " Nan inquired . " He seems some way , " Jason reflected , " always to go in over his head . I 've noticed that about him . " Marcia Mae stirred restlessly . For a few minutes past , heat lightning had been flashing in the west . Kerney said respectfully but firmly , " I 'm not sure that 's true of Duncan , Mr. Jason . I see a lot of him . He thinks the time has come to progress a little , but he wants to do it in the right way . Does n't that always make people seem slow ? " " Jason means to say you ca n't be right unless you talk to the right people , " Nan Hunt said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jason that his wife had turned into evil . The front screen door slammed , and brought them all to notice that Marcia Mae had left them . " So now , Cissy , " Kerney asked , " do you understand ? " " About what ? " asked Cissy . Later she followed him out to the car where it sat under the cedars in the drive . They sat in the car and had a cigarette and she let him kiss her a few times . Then she drew away and laid her cheek down in the window , against the metal of the door . Honeysuckle smelled so strong you could not even smell the car . " I know about Duncan and Marcia Mae , Kerney . " After a long silence , he said , " How did you know ? " " She goes back in the woods to walk sometimes , and one day I was out near where the path goes down to the tennis court when I saw her coming up through the trees . She looked pretty and happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She got mad , and mean  --  goodness ! She said I had followed her . It madep134me so mad I could spit . I went and told Mother on her and Mother said we all had to be patient , that Marcia Mae acted peculiarbecause her husband had got blown up and she went off by herself to be unhappy . Then I thought , She sure was n't unhappywhen I saw her before she saw me . But I did n't say anything to Mother and then I knew about Duncan . Goodness ! " She laughed . " A scandal in the family . You guess everybody knows it ? " " People have been waiting to know it ever since she hit town , " Kerney said . " How did you know ? " " I went by the office to find Duncan a couple of weeks back . He was n't in , so I went to his house . Tinker was sitting out in the back yard with the lawn mower , trying to make up her mind to get up and use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew I 'd better not say , Where 's Duncan ? God bless her . " " You feel all that sorry for her ? " " There 's nobody like Tinker . " " It 's funny . Men always feel that about Tinker , but she does n't have any girl friends at all , does she ? " " You women are such snobs , that 's the only thing . You think , Oh , Tinker Taylor . The one that chased Duncan Harper till he finally married her . She 's nobody but old Gains Taylor 's daughter . " " I do n't think anything of the kind . I just think she 's hard to talk to . I tried to talk to her at the garden party last summer , but she would n't say anything . " " She probably felt uncomfortable in stockings and heels , " said Kerney . " She 's the original woman . All the rest of you are playing paper dolls . " " Well I like that ! " He held her back from opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Want to go for a ride ? " " No . " " Want to go get a Coke ? " " No . " " Want a drink ? " " No . " " Want a kiss ? " " No . No , no . " " Cigarette ? " " Umm . One more . "  | " What do you think about it ? " he asked her . " If it 's true ? " " About Duncan and Marcia Mae ? It 's their business , I guess . It 's her own life . That 's the way she 's always acted . " " But what do you think ? " " I think she 's crazy , " said Cissy . " Where 's the future in it ? " Kerney shrugged . " Maybe they still love each other . Maybe he 'll leave Tinker , and they 'll get married . " " She would n't have him . She would n't before and would n't again . " She said this in her chill proud little voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face to his . " But if he was n't married and if you were she , what would you do then ? " " You would n't catch me on a deal like that . I used to have this awful crush on Duncan . I still just think he 's wonderful . But you know what I 'd tell him ? I 'd tell him to go jump in the lake . " " But suppose  --  suppose it was me instead of Duncan ? What would you do then ? " She stared at him a moment and then burst out laughing . " Why , Kerney Woolbright ! If you are n't the craziest thing ! Do you think for one minute  --  Kerney ! " " Hush , " he said . " Stop laughing . " She stopped finally and put her cigarette out , snuffing it carefully in the ash tray . " I 've got to go in . " She turned to him . Her face , serious , lovely , melting , came lifting toward him , and to herself she knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw herself better than she saw him , how her eyes were velvet , her mouth tender , and her dark hair all intricate with the swelling night . So he kissed her and as they drew apart his hand , in midimpulseof caress , fell short and touched her cheek instead . He saw how slight such moments were , and wondered at love 's terrible deflections . That night he lost more than his usual quota of sleep over her , twisting on the crumpled sheets , eluded continually by a mosquito.  |p136Cissy  , meanwhile , quarreled with her mother about having to go back down and latch the screen , played the radio awhile , filed her pretty nails , and went to sleep . The blue glitter of Tinker 's little Chevrolet , coming out of the east , was marked by Jimmy Tallant long before he saw her inside or knew she was going to stop there . He stood with his hands in his pockets out in front of the roadhouse , which was now no more or less than a filling station with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snack stand . He or Bud opened the place just enough to keep up their license with the gas company . As a matter of fact , Jimmy liked to be up there by himself . He had his morose side , and alone he watched endlessly the trucks come snorting to the crest of the hill to the west , admired the triumphant boom in their descent , or from the long shimmering eastern approach the razzle-dazzle of the new cars in the sun , making such a little sound when they passed , exactly like an ounce of air pressure being released from a tire , and there went a ton of sweet metal , lancing at eighty toward the Mississippi and beyond . It was not the cars themselves that intrigued him , though questioned at any moment he could have said instantly what make , what year , and what model , but the sense of the linked immensities of America , the feeling that he and his two gas pumps and roadhousewere all another flicker in the eye of the traveler who found nothing there out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one after the other : Charleston , Atlanta , Birmingham , Meridian , Shreveport , Dallas , Houston , El Paso , Tucson , San Diego : the sun blazed on them all , and everywhere a man stood before a roadhouse , near two gas pumps , arms folded , and watched the highway . Then he saw the car that looked like Tinker 's and he forgotp137the U.S.A. , for she was slowing down , a quieter dazzle tossed about the blue hood , and the gravel crackled beneath the tires . " Well ! " He leaned into the window . " If it is n't herself . The rich man 's beauty and the poor man 's dream . Get out , lamb child . I wanted to see you most in the world . " Beneath her dark glasses her mouth smiled . She wore , as always , a true lipstick color . For coolness her dark hair was caught up from the nape by a black grosgrain band . " Where 've you been , honey ? " he asked . The red mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Clark . " " The picture show ? Right after lunch on a day like this ? " " Well , I got somebody to keep Cotton and Patsy for a change . I walked right out the door when she walked into it . " " What was on at the show ? " The mouth hesitated . " Is n't that silly ? I ca n't even think  --  Jimmy , I wanted to ask you if you knew a Negro to do my wash . Duncan is wearing about a dozen shirts a day . I do n't know why shaking hands with people should get so many shirts dirty . " " Everybody asks me about niggers since Duncan shut me down . But hell , I ca n't even find anybody to wash dishes in my own kitchen . You might try Beck Dozer 's wife , though . She 'll take in a little sometimes if she needs the cash . " " I 'll drive by there now . " " You know how to go . It 's the old Wiltshire road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I remember . Yes . " She did not move to turn the ignition . " But you could n't remember the name of the show . " He still could not see her eyes . He did not need to . She put both small hands on the wheel and laid her foreheaddown on them . " Oh , Jimmy . What am I going to do ? " " I do n't know , baby . You 've just got to ride out the storm , I guess . " They 'll never come apart . Only she  --  if she 'd been any kindp138of woman she never could have left him before . How can he forgive her now ? " " How can you forgive him ? " " I do n't forgive him . I ca n't stop loving him , that 's all . " " Then there you are . " " You remember how she used to play tennis when we were all in high school ? All afternoon ; I can see her yet . In white shorts and a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hit a ball as hard as a boy . She 'd throw everything behind the racquet , leave the ground . Grit her teeth . I bet when she 's a rut she gets like that . I bet when she  --  " " You 'll make yourself sick , " said jimmy . " Come inside out of this sun . There 's a room in the back where it 's cool . " She opened the car door . " We 'd better drive it around to the back , " he said . " Lacey is another name for the Gestapo . " " You think I give a happy damn ? Let them see the car . Let 's make it all more interesting for them . " But he shoved her gently over and took the car around to the back himself . Just off the office was a bedroom where he and Bud used to take turns about sleeping the morning through when the business was on the boom , and they did n't shut down till dawn came and bled the neon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rug , a brass bed , a cane rocking chair with a cretonne-covered cushion , and a pair of straight curtains in the window which the Negro cook had made himself out of a pair of flour sacks . There was an old-timey Victorian bowl and pitcher , soap-dish and chamber-pot set stacked up on the dresser . A Negro had once offered it to Jimmy in exchange for a fifth of whisky . Jimmy had no use for it , but he pitied an honest thirst . Later it came in handy , for Bud had been known to rent the room to couples when the little houses out at the side were all filled . Jimmy raised the window and propped it in place , then turned on the electric fan . " It 's shady back here now . Lie down , honey . It 'll be cool in here in a minute . "  |p139He  brought back two Cokes from the cooler and packages of Nabs . She took a few thirsty swallows and then sat holding the bottle , forgetting it . " Jimmy , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that you work this kind of thing out so that you live it one day at the time . You do n't see things in big blocks of months and years , or what awful thing is finally going to happen . You just say , Now let 's see . What am I going to have for supper ? " " I 've said that already . I already know . " He saw her neat kitchen where there were no gadgets : the smooth marble slab she rolled the biscuits on , the grease-blackened pans she cooked her muffins in , and the big butcher knives , not bought out of a store , but the kind the Negroes made out of scrap steel , the hickory handles steel-hammered in place , and she had a whetstone too . One time during one of her summer parties when they had all gathered down on the terrace she had been slicing some ham in the kitchen and had cut herself . Duncan , who had been drinking more than usual , had picked up the knife . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying . " I-Ier hand is about the size of a baby 's . You would n't think she could pick it up , you would n't think  --  . " He held it out before him . " You 're letting her bleed to death , " Jimmy remarked , so that Duncan 's hand went tight on the hickory handle . They all knew each other too well . She , meanwhile , had stopped the blood herself , having recalledsomething she learned in Red Cross class about a big vein  --  she forgot its name . Jimmy turned her wrist and there lay a small white line . " The thing is , " she was saying , " no awful thing is going to happen . They can go on like this forever . She does n't want a husband , she just wants a man . You think she wants to cook and keep a house ? You think she 'd love a child if she had one ? " " I think it 's possible that she might . " " She does n't love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what love is. "  | " Let 's get off this one , Tinker . Everybody knows about love . Men , women , children , and coon dogs . They all know . It 's the big old wide-open secret of the world , honey . I 've loved you all my life , for instance . You think I ever have to tell you or anybodyelse ? " " Oh , Jimmy . " She began to cry a little and he sat down by her to comfort her , holding her against his shoulder . " It should be after a high-school dance , " she said , even smiling a little . " Except I never got you on a bed before . I suppose I neglected to mention it . " They remembered his long agonized speeches , the times he used to break out laughing at himself . " Yes , you did once before . The night Marcia Mae 's and Duncan'sengagement came out in the paper . I went to Memphis with you and went up to the hotel room with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got sick and then passed out . You never gave me a chance . " " I 'm such a common girl . I do such awful things . You did n't think less of me ? " " I never thought more of you . " " How do you manage , Jimmy ? Duncan always says you like to be unhappy . That if you were happy you would n't know what to do . " " Duncan pursues happiness and I do n't . That 's the whole difference . He need n't talk smug . Right this minute I may be a sight happier than he is . " She sighed and dropped her head . " Men like to talk . " " You think it 's all her fault , do n't you ? " " Of course it 's her fault . She left him , ran off with that lumber-jack . " " Honey , he was n't a lumberjack . " " All right , what difference does that make ? The minute she came back she started after Duncan again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think it was ? His ? "  | " I do n't think she would have left him if he had n't failed her someway . " She stiffened to make some wifely defense , but thought better of it . " We can sit here for hours and say nasty things about them . " He smiled . " Well , let 's do . " " Let 's be mean . " " I hate blondes , do n't you ? " " Despise them . They tell you lies . " " And they 're dumb . " " And stuck up . " " And mean and  --  " " Jimmy ! " The shout from outside the empty roadhouse struck them both silent . Jimmy said rapidly , " It 's Bud . I 'll put him off . The door there goes into the rest room and it opens out the side . You can watch your chance and get out that way . " The next instant he was through the door to the office , and she could hear Bud Grantham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office door . " Have they come yet ? " Bud asked . " Has who come yet ? " " Who 's back there then ? " " Nobody . I was taking a nap , for Chris'sake . " " Do n't give me that . There 's a car out back . " " Oh yeah , I know . Hanley sent his nigger in the Chevvy demonstrator . Somebody told him his new hog-wire fence was broken down back in the bottom . The nigger left the car up here in the shade . "  | " I thought they might have come . " " Who might have come ? " " Sam called this morning . I left word at the house with Bella . " " I have n't been home . " " You did n't eat at home ? " " I ate uptown , at the cafe . " Bud said , " You ai n't doing right by my little girl , Jimmy . And her with a chap to care for . " " Listen , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this world do n't say Praise God when her husband ca n't make it home to dinner . I was only being thoughtful . You think any man likes to eat in a cafe when he could put his feet under his own table ? Now come on . What about Sam ? " " he called from New Orleans , or rather got Mitchell to call for him . He  --  " " Jim  --  meee ! " The door far up toward the front of the roadhouse slammed and they heard the drag of loose heels on the concrete floor . It was Bella . They both lowered their eyes , like boys caught in something . Neither one of them ever really wanted to see Bella . As a matter of fact , Jimmy liked her better than Bud did . She frequentlyamused him ; he sometimes pitied her ; and when he felt both of these things at once he became quite fond of her and could make her happy for weeks at a time by letting her know it once . But the only thing she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in the door where Bud had moved out of it . She was wearing the flowered wrapper , the one they had told her when she bought it looked enough like a dress to wear it uptown and she had believed them , and a pair of high-heel sling-back white shoes , grass-stained , with the heels broken inward and the strap that was supposed to hold them up lying under her instep . She wore the baby at her waist as if it were a big bow tie . She said to Jimmy , " Are you back here ? " 142 " Looks like I am . Does n't it ? " She giggled . " Silly ! Daddy come by the house this morning . He said to tell you there was a man from New Orleans called  --  Daddy ! Are you back here too ? " " Wipe his mouth , " said Jimmy . " I did n't bring nothing for it . " She caught up the hem of her skirt . " I should have worn a tie , " said Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the child . " God damn , what a face . Come here , Buster . " He took the baby and held it folded together under one arm in a manner unorthodox but firm . The baby grew extremely happy and began to sputter . " Miss Annie Miller uptown , " said Bella ; " she told me yesterdayhe looked exactly like you . " " She must have lost her eyesight , " said Jimmy . " He Iooks more like an Apache Indian chief than he does me or you or Bud or half-dozen Granthams all put together . " I-le thrust the baby suddenly in Bud 's face . " You notice a resemblance ? " he inquired . " See anything you want to claim ? " The baby was indeed uncommonly dark . He had a thick crop of spiky black hair that stuck out around his brow , saucer fashion . " Koochee koochee , " went Bud , wiggling one tough old brown finger . " Koochee koochee koo . Do n't give him to me , jimmy . Fannie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koo , baby . Koo , baby . Koo . " " Whose car is that one I saw out back ? " " Huh ? Oh , car . Is it still back there ? " Jimmy craned out the window . " Hanley 's nigger he sent up to check the fence down in the pasture . Left it up here in the shade . " " Hey , Tallant ! " The door of the roadhouse banged again and a man 's voice rang . " Old home week , " said Jimmy . " I think it 's the Candidate . " " I called him , " said Bud . " Sam will want to see him . That was all right , was n't it ? They aim to put the skids under this Harper thing . We might as well put all we got behind it . "  |p143Jimmy  sighed . " Sure , I know . It 's just that Follansbee is my personal nomination for the man least calculated to put me in a mood for weaving daisy chains . " Willard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jimmy , " if it is n't the white hope of Winfield County . Only you look more like the black hope than the white one . Christ a'mighty , man , do n't you know if you 're running for office you 've either got to look like a one-gallus tramp and slobber tobacco juice , or make a halfhearted pass at looking like a gentleman ? When did you shave last ? " Follansbee touched his chin . It was not really a chin , only a gable on his neck . " This morning , " he said . " I shave every morning . It just grows so fast , that 's all . Means I 'm virile , Jimmy . Full of sap and spark . " " That ai n't the way I heard it , " said Jimmy . " How 'd you hear it ? " " It means you 're going to grass . For a fact it does . Did n't you know that dead people 's hair keeps growing , growing , growing . That 's all they 're busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Bella . " It 's the truth . I read it in a magazine . " " Bella , my heart , " said jimmy . " Why do n't you get the hell on out of here ? There must be a whole pile of things the mother of one has to do around the house . " " Travis 's hair , " said Willard dolefully , settling back on his head the hat he had lifted as Bella left ( he lifted it now about a million times a day ) . " I reckon if that 's so what you said , his old red hair must be a yard long by now , with five months to grow in . " It 's laying all around him in the coffin , " Jimmy said . " All around his shoulders . " " Hush up ! " Bud Grantham said . " You 're tempting the devil , Jimmy , you and Willard , talking about the dead . It ai n't fittin ' . " " Well , we 've all got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a fact , " said jimmy . " I do n't dispute it , " said Bud . " Jimmy , about those folks that are coming up here  --  "  | " Talk to Bud . He caught the phone . " " You both know what they want . They want to put money back of Willard . " " Money , yes , " said Jimmy . " But why come up here ? " " Well , " said Bud , " to see where the money 's going to go to , I reckon , just like anybody else . They 've had experience in these things . " " That 's just the trouble , " said Jimmy . " They 've had too much experience . I do n't know if I like it much . " " ' We 've got to have their money to fight this Harper thing . " " That 's what they want us to think , " Jimmy said . " That we 've got to have it . " " Well , do n't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that point in a race  --  about six weeks before the election  --  that comes to every political candidate whether he is running for the Presidency or justice of the peace in the smallest crossroads in west Texas : he had to win . It had become a total necessity . " I do n't like the way the wind 's blowing , " said Jimmy . " Look . They come up here , they offer to pour money in . How much do you think they 'll offer ? " " We mentioned five thousand , " said Bud , " the first go-round . " " But they 're making a special trip . Suppose they mention ten thousand , fifteen ? What then ? Do we take it ? " " We 'd look silly not to , " said Willard . Jimmy turned on him . " Will you keep out of this ? ' What do you mean we ? You do n't own a stick of this place . It 's Bud 's and it 's mine , and what we say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Willard . " What do you think we ought to do then ? " said Bud . " Yougot to hurry up , Jimmy . They 're on the road and traveling . " " I 'm thinking maybe we should n't take anything . " " Nothing ! " ' Willard squeaked . " Look , " said Jimmy , " I planned the right way to throw this thing our way and there 's no reason on earth why it wo n't work . All you got to do is keep it up and keep it up and keep it up thatp146Duncan Harper is a nigger lover . The keystone is the picture we took : we embroider from there , we quote him , we tell stories about him , and maybe none of it is quite the truth , but we 've alwaysgot to lead back to that picture which is down in black and white and nobody can dispute it . " On the other hand , if we get scared and take this money , what then ? We win the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our right to say how much gambling equipment we want to put in , who we aim to hire and why ; pretty soon we wo n't even be allowed in the room when they count up the Gash . They can sweet-talk all they want to about there are n't any strings on this money , but you know and I know , Bud , that there are always strings . It 's exactly like taking federal funds to build your houses , to plant your land , to buy your cotton nobody else wants . No strings on that either except pretty soon the government owns your soul and you sit and cuss it till you 're blue in the face , but if somebody mentions taking that precious parity away from you , you squall like the last of a noble line threatened with imminent castration . I 'm sorry but I 'm too much of a states-righter to see this any other way . If you 're subsidized you 're sunk . I 've got a natural love for the business Bud and I had built up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County citizen to want to tell those sons o ' bitches to go back where they came from . " " It 's your business and mine , " said Bud , " for a fact . " " I do n't know , " said Willard gloomily . " All that talking is all right , Jimmy , but when the time comes you have n't been coming down the line . " " What do you mean ? " " You pulled that one off after I tipped you the National Guard was coming up : they did n't find a drop . Okay . But two weeks later Harper comes out singlehanded and shuts you down . There were those standing by to cart him off neat and quick that night , but you stalled . Then up at the jail , okay , you wrapped that one up , picture and all . But two weeks later Harper gets the niggerp147to come out and say it was a put-up job and what then ? You do n't lay a finger on the nigger . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like you , Jimmy . There are those that keeps on saying you 're just projecking around , that you do n't want to win this race at all . They say that Harper 's wife 's got the Indian sign  --  now , I never said it , Jimmy . I never even thought it . But if people are saying it , then you ought to know about it , is the way I feel . I honestly do . " " He sho ' do n't lay a finger on that nigger , " said Bud . " And wo n't let nobody else . " " Seems like it 's you that 's the nigger lover , " said Willard . " If a nigger double-talked me that way I 'd have me a showdown before nightfall . " " All right then , run it without me , " said jimmy . " I 'll get out right now . Walk out of here and never come back . Bud , you can write Willard 's speeches . Willard , you can bargain with Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much money you want , how much share you 're willing to give for it . I 'm tired anyway . It 's time I took a vacation . Every morning I say to myself , Here I am thirty-five years old and I 've never seen Niagara Falls or Mammoth Cave . Or maybe I 'll go West . There 's things to see  --  " " Jimmy , for God 's sake , " Willard said , " I think I hear the car . Whatever I said , I take it back . " Bud Grantham hauled his shoulders together . " It 's nothing to prank about , boy . Old Bud would n't know his own name without you to tell it to him . " The screen door far out front slammed and numbers of footstepssounded and stopped . There came a murmuring , but this time no one called . Jimmy went out to greet them . He hoped to hell that Tinker had seen her chance and taken it , but he had not heard the car.  |p148This  time there were four of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pilston , and the boy who carried the gun for them . And there was Sam himself . Sam was a gentlemanlylookingman who did not weigh very much , and though all the men were taller than he , he did not seem short either . He wore a light blue Palm Beach suit , crisply pressed , a white shirt , and a navy tie with a maroon figure . He was bald with a benevolent rime of white hair , and his eyes were a clear blue . He gave a sort of definition to the two older men who were with him : Jimmy had not thought of them as thugs before . But he failed somehow to define the boy who carried the gun . He only made him seem younger than ever , and chewing gum that way made it seem a toy pistol that he wore beneath his arm , probably one that had come full of candy . Jimmy shook hands with the boy heartily . " Hello , Wally . Still like your work ? " " There ai n't any work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ride around in the car and look out the window . " " You mean you ai n't used that thing yet ? There ai n't been anybody mean enough to shoot ? " " It looks like it , " said Walter . " Only it ai n't shooting anybodythey got in mind . No more than a policeman shoots people . I 'm kind of like a policeman , see ? " " That 's a new one , " Jimmy said . " What about that , Mitchell ? The kid here says he 's like a policeman . " " We explained it all to him , " said Mitchell . " We talked it all over with him and we all came to that conclusion . That 's right , ai n't it , Wally ? " The boy grinned , shifting the gum to the other jaw . " ' At 's right . " " This boy here , " said Sam to Bud Grantham with pride , " canp149shoot a gun better than anyone 1 have been privileged to observe . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've spent pleasant hours watching the kind of mark he can strike . He does n't miss , that 's all . He simply does not miss . " " Is he really that good ? " Jimmy asked Mitchell . " He can shoot all right , " said Mitchell . " How good are you , Wally ? " Jimmy asked . He liked Wallace . He felt he knew him by heart . Wallace grinned . " Well , up in Tippah County where I'us bawn , that 's where I learned to shoot , from my Unker Chollie Klappert  --  up there they usta say I could take the middle claw off a killdee 's foot on the far side . It always come easy to me , shooting . " " Chollie Klappert your blood uncle ? " Jimmy asked . " Sure is . " " I 'm kin to them myself . That makes us cousins . " " Well I swan , " said the boy . He was pleased . Sam said , " I dislike to change the subject , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This office is all right , but it 's rather small , do n't you agree ? Now if we could have some light out in your main room and pull two of the tables together . . . ? " He gestured toward where Jimmy sat in the window , blocking the larger part of the view with his shoulders . " Sure , " said Jimmy , " We can do all that and we can serve you a drink of whisky for real hospitality . But we better tell you first off that Bud and Willard here and me been talking this deal over and we 've decided that we 're against it . We 've got this election sewed up anyway ; there 's no need for outside help . As for the business we do with you after the election , we 've discussed that months ago , before Travis Brevard died , though I never got to sound him on it . Willard here has been sounded and is agreeable provided certain interests of his own are protected . Bud and I , we deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Duncan Harper . We do the dealing . Now if that 's clear we 'll have a drink on former contractsand call it a day . I 've got  --  "  |p150The  screen had banged again and the heels were sounding on the concrete . Bella was back . She would have the baby with her , Jimmy knew . He took advantage of the moment to look out the window , and he could stop sweating , for Tinker had got away . Bella stood in the door . She always wanted to look at people up close . She used to meet everybody that stopped even long enough to use the rest room back when the roadhouse was open , and now she was lonesome , and to add to it she needed a certain number of people every day to tell her how cute the baby was . She had on make-up this time and a proper dress . Jimmy spieled out the introductions without even uncrossing his knee . Sam was smooth as butter  --  it was enough to make you cry ; and Mitchell got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Bella 's appearance as the most natural thing in the world  --  it would seem that women carrying babies had showed up in most situations of his life . So the turn passed round to the fourth , the Indian-looking man , and Jimmy still could not remember his name . It was the name that stopped him , and while he was still staring trying to think of the name , he found instead that the face he was looking into , framed with spiky black hair , was more familiar than it had any right to be and still be on a man whose name he could n't call . He saw that the face was muting like the coils in a juke box from scarlet to purple , the way a baby 's face colors when it screams its head off at night for nothing but pure unadulterated meanness . The room had grown deathly silent , until at last Bella , who had apparently been hard put also to remember the man 's name , burst into a smile of innocent delight . " If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the Indian-looking man , and swallowed . " Pilston . Sure . What on earth made me say Pittman ? I declare , I said to Jimmy the other day that I 'm alltime getting  --  " She trailed off , seeing that they were all silent and downcast , and at last her face burned ( for memory walked as slowly into Bella 's brain as a solitary hen in midafternoon deciding for somep151reason to climb the crosswalk and hop into the henhouse ) . She looked wildly from Pilston to the baby , who were staring at each other in primitive horror , the baby 's face unfortunately reflecting not only Pilston 's every feature but his emotions as well . Then she said , " Oh . " It was a little sound uttered in a little girl 's honest voice , and on it she turned and fled . After a time Jimmy Tallant gave a short laugh and walked out of the room . Every so often things happen to a person which are like others that have happened , and in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disgraceful , the person finds his identity is reaffirmed , and so he is at peace . He had grown up in the shadow of what his father had done  --  all his growing indeed had been raising his head closer to that knowledge . Tinker had not chosen him . Even in the blind senseless dark of poor Bella another man 's seed had contrived to run home and lock the door against his own . But not being really a bitter person , it was not that he thought so much about it as that he felt cast back again into his old lonely freedom . So as he went down through the field to the woods back of the roadhouse , having recalled an appointment to meet Beck Dozer , he went whistling absently , and once picked up a stone to see how far he could throw it . Back up the hill in the roadhouse office , Bud Grantham at last straightened from where he had been leaning against the desk with his shoulders hunched to let his old tough brown head sink low between them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You folks make yourselves at home . I best go and see about my girl . Her mother died when she was scarce the size of that one with her and I was never the one to raise a pack of little chaps , as time over and again it 's proved to me I was never the one for it . " Leaving , he drew out a great handkerchief , and from outside they heard him honk his nose . Sam , all the while , had sat cleaning and paring his nails with a nickel-plated gadget . His hands were white , clean and firm , like a surgeon 's and he cut the hangnails cleanly free on all ten purep152white , without a trace of blood . He at last folded the gadget back upon itself and dropped it into his coat pocket . He dusted his knees . Then he looked at Mitchell . " Ignoring various family complications which have arisen , I conclude that Mr. Grantham and Mr. Tallant do not wish to do business with us today . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Sam , " we have a long hot drive ahead , and before someone or other of them decides to come back and shoot Mr. Pilston here , I suppose we had best be on our way . " He made a gesture of rising , when Willard Follansbee , who had been thinking in the corner for some time , said , " Wait " in a tone of despair . " Yes ? " said Sam . " He do n't want to win the race , " said Willard . " He ai n't going to lift a hand to win it . Everybody knows it . " " Not want to win ? Why on earth not want to win ? " " I 'll tell you , but do n't you say I told you . He 's crazy about Duncan Harper 's wife . She can turn him any way . " Sam sat thinking . " That clears it . I thought myself , he does not want to win . " He straightened . " Go get him , Mitchell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising . " His house , I would think . " " He did n't go home , " said Wallace , the boy , who had been sitting where he had a glimpse out the window . " I seen him head down that field and towards the woods . " " You go with Mitchell then , Wally . And quickly , please . " As Duncan had once before , Tinker came to Beck Dozer 's house , saw where the " Z " had run on the mailbox and drew her car into the shallow curve out of the main road . She ascended the path to the gate and stood outside it.  | " Anybody home ? " " Home ? ' " said the wood . A young Negro woman , thin and straight as a broomstick , dressed in a straight-cut gingham dress , came down the steps and out to open the gate for her . Her head was wound in a white rag and she wore straws in her ears . " Come on in , " she said to Tinker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . " Tinker accompanied her to the house . The Negroid effluvium touched her round , mingled with a drift of wood smoke from the back , and the scent of spring water which draws itself clean out of the earth and brings with it of all earth only its black odor . " Does Aunt Mattie still live with you ? " she asked . She had suddenly , by the smell of the house , remembered the old woman , though she had not thought of her for years . She had been very sick once when she was a child , and Aunt Mattie had invited herself in and stayed with them and nursed her . When the fever left her , she was weak as a baby and had to learn to walk again . Aunt Mattie would take her up in her lap and sit near the window with her . It was April and the spring was just turning to a deeper warmth  --  this was a new time and Tinker felt herself new again . With fever 's sensitivities. she had heard them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too , but Aunt Mattie had not wavered and had had no time for them : the spoon with the food in it had come at her in the black hand with the nails bluegraylike the silver spoon , had come at her , and come again . Her mother cried in the kitchen , " You put bacon grease in it again ! " and wept she was so vexed . In bed Tinker heard it and her tongue came out and licked . That was why it had tasted so good and strong and black , not because it came off the blackness of the hand with the spoon . When she sat weak in the window and Aunt Mattie held her feet together under an old piece of cotton blanket , she thought she had been born out of Aunt Mattie 's lap . Aunt Mattie was not a bit modest . " Mattie done save this precious , " she told her . " Had n't been for Mattie you 'd be gone from here.  |p154Yo  ' mamma don ' know nothing about dis chile like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm , Granny 's here . You wants to come and speak with her ? " Tinker followed her inside , through a dim hallway where a door led off into a large room with a bed in the corner and chairs grouped around a cold fireplace . In the far rocker , the largest , Aunt Mattie was waiting out the time under an old pile of quilts . Her thin hands kept together on her lap , and her head leaned to one side as if trying to catch a little light from , the window . The hair was white , kinky and very short : it hugged the old skull and made a neat fitting of itself , all the way around . The wrinkles ran downward and were cleft deep ; Aunt Mattie had not played around with age . She was so nearly blind she was aware only of strong sunlight . Yet she could hear well enough . " Here 's somebody come to see you , Granny , " said Lucy . Tinker put her hand on Mattie 's . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The old hands moved caressingly , exploring the fingers and wrist with a fine tremulous dry touch . " I doan ' know you , chile , but doan ' tell me . Talk twel I hears your family voice . " " When I was sick one time you came and nursed me . " " They ai n't a chile in this town ca n't say I did n't . White folks doan ' know nothing about they churen . " " I 'm married now myself , Aunt Mattie . I 've got two childrenof my own . " " I hears your voice now . You 's Emmie Taylor 's chile . " " That 's right . " " I mind the mawning they tole me you 's sick . I was down by the branch at the ole place , boiling sheets . They come down the heel and say to me , You know Miss Emmie Taylor 's little girl ? They had to keh her home from school today she took so sick . So I says right then , Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sick baby . So that 's when Mattie come , honey . " " You saved my life , Aunt Mattie , " said Tinker , kneeling down so that her hand rested comfortably between the fingers that held so lightly , pressing now and again to emphasize a word . She had not meant it so , but when she knelt tears came easily , rushing , and fell warm on Mattie 's hands and her own . Mattie did not question her . " There , baby . There . Hit 's going to be all right . " Her head sank then and she cried all over . Mattie groped across her head , her shoulders , caressing her . " There , baby . There , baby . She Mattie 's chile . " She rose when she was done and found her bag for a handkerchief . Lucy had retired , who knew when , or would ever know ? She was a Negro , and her tact was of this quality . The room rested deep in twilight . Tinker walked into the open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but did not return . She knew that Mattie now perhaps thought she had come yesterday or last year , and would not know her if she spoke again . The tears had left her exalted and hushed . She thought with a gratitude as immense as a clear sky that today there had been Mattie and Jimmy to ease her . She sat down gravely on the porch steps . A man ran into the house from the back steps . It seemed that Lucy had entered the hall from some side door the instant that he was calling , " Lucy ! Lucy ! " Tinker sprang up and saw him say , " I gots to run , Lucy . It 's Mister Jimmy Tallant . Somebody shot him  --  " " Lawd , Beck , was it you ? " " No , but they 'll think so . They thinks so now . " " Who thinks ? How come they thinks ? " " I was coming along the path , hoping to see did Mister Tallant have any little job for me , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I never thought nothing except it was somebodyp156out hunting , till I looked over in the edge of the pasture and there was a man laying and nobody else near . I come up close to see who and there was blood running out and 1 says , ' Oh God , it 's Mister Tallant ! ' " Was he dead ? " " I do n't know . There was n't time to see . Then 's when I saw two white men walking away up at the rise of the hill toward the highway , and I thought I better get away from here , but one was coming back already , pointing at me and hollering , You can say what you want to , but we know you did it , - nigger . We saw you and we know and you sure better run ! You better get lost , nigger ! ' " " Oh Jesus , Beck ! " " What chance I got , Lucy , if they say it was me ? What can I do ? I gots to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can .... " Tinker was running herself by then , back along the path to the woods that Beck had fled from . She was the first after Beck Dozer to find him . Bud Grantham , some little time after the New Orleans car had driven away , had begun to look for him here and there , and so came upon them both in the dewy corner of the pasture just at dusk , she on her knees in blood beside him , tearing cloth from his shirt . " Call an ambulance ! " she cried across the field . He ran at once to obey , not completely understanding . He felt that day that his tough old heart had been grieved once , and now again , beyond anything it had been fitting to expect . To Bud nothing seemed to be happening decently , and it was at this , as much as for fear that Jimmy was seriously injured , that he almost wept as he made for the telephone.  |p158Nan  Hunt had a caller . The girls , Cissy and Marcia Mae , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quickly shut the curtained French doors because they were n't dressed and had no wish to talk to anybody , could hear from within the murmuringrise and fall of ladies ' voices . They did not make out the words . Cissy was doing her nails . A manicure case waited on the floor beside her chair and she held a large open bottle of polish remover clamped between her bare knees . She wet bits of cotton with the remover and cleaned the old polish away in gaudy smears . The reek of the chemical was all out of proportion to the importance of the affair , but so , for that matter , was Cissy 's degree of concentration upon it . Gunshot would scarcely have disturbed her . Her nails grew in firm ovals out of the moist pads of her fingertips ; she enticed them to a shapely length with her emery boards . Marcia Mae , who glanced now and again over her plain hands , could not resist watching her sister 's strategies . Cissy was nineteen , and poised that summer at a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of order in the universe . The flesh of her arm was soft as freshly molded butter ; even the redolence of the bathroom when she left it held something all lazily like a sigh . She was not at all beautiful ; perhaps she was not even pretty : she made everybody so nervous that nobody knew any better how she looked than Kerney Woolbright did , with her eyes like chocolate fudge still warm from the pan and her hair as glossy as a blooded chestnut'scoat . If the fact of her innocence was disturbing , the questionof her self-knowledge was worse : every touch of the file lured the little hands into a greater sensual alertness  --  was Cissy so unaware of this ?  | " If you paint them now , " said Marcia Mae , " I 'll scream . " Called up , Cissy questioned that she had been addressed . Herlittle uncertainties were charming . She touched her tongue to herbottom lip before she spoke . " Did n't you ever like to paint your fingernails ? When you were my age , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , " and Marcia Mae knew it . " Some women , even at thirty , can still manage that sort of thing . " " Mother says you ought to quit it , though , after you 're ma-ture . " " You mean to say you admit you 're immature ? " Cissy , like a plot of lush foliage reluctant to stir in the breeze , only yawned . Her voice , like her mother 's , was seldom raised . But she was apparently not without kindness . " I wish I had grown up when you did , " she said . " You all had a lot more fun . I used to be jealous of you , always going somewherewith Duncan and Jimmy and Tinker Taylor . I used to wish I would hurry up and grow too . But it is n't all that much fun . " " We did have fun . But there were lots more of us than just four . " " You were the main ones . Things did n't happen without you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You and Duncan always went in Jimmy Tallant 's car . " " That 's because Duncan never had a car of his own . " " No ! I did n't know that ! " In Cissy 's time , for a man not to own a car seemed as bad as if he never brushed his teeth or shined his shoes . " But he was a big football player ! " Her sense of shock increased . Marcia Mae laughed . " Duncan Harper was the only AllAmericanin captivity , I reckon , who never so much as owned a Ford , let alone a Cadillac . " " Is he still that way ? " Cissy asked  |p160She  did not look up , but in the ensuing silence she steadily painted a fingernail with a tiny brush . " You 'll have to ask his wife , " said Marcia Mae . Cissy painted another nail . " You know , Kerney is just crazy about her . He likes her more than he does me . " " There 's something pathetic about her , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to be protected . God knows from what . " " She 's common , " said Cissy and dipped her little brush . " Men do n't care if women are common , " said Marcia Mae . " Look what she did , " Cissy pursued , " when Jimmy Tallant got shot . She went all out , stopping the blood , getting an ambulance , crying right in front of everybody , sitting all night in the hospital . I 'd just die before I 'd do anything like that . It 's like crying out loud at a funeral , or saying you 're constipated . " " What a prissy little thing you are ! " said Marcia Mae . " It is n't just me . Everybody said that , said she ought to be ashamed taking things over like that when it was another woman 's husband . Even Grandmother said so , and she never talks about anybody . " " Oh nuts . I do n't like her either , but that 's not the reason . I think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shot husband you want to . " " Then why do n't you like her ? " Marcia Mae hesitated . " I did n't really mean I do n't like her . I mean I did n't like her when I knew her best . That was nearly ten years ago . " " Well , why did n't you like her then ? " Marcia Mae set both hands into her waistline and , sitting up straight as though weary from long traveling , flexed her slender back . " Well , she was always so little and cute . Her fanny bobbled when she crossed the room . She would listen to shady stories , but she would n't tell them . She went with Tallant for years and never gave an inch . " " Never did what ? "  | " Never slept with him , I mean . " " Should you ? " inquired Cissy , who had taken root in her mother 's virtuous advice that if you gave a man what he wanted he would n't want it any more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . I think it 's wrong to parade it like a bowl of cream before a cat . I think it 's disgusting . " Cissy capped her little filthy-smelling bottle and spread her fingers out on her bare knees to dry . " But maybe she 's changed now , " said Marcia Mae , She lighted a cigarette and drew her knees up in the swing and circled them with her arms . She had really fine legs , better than her sister 's , whose ankles were too round and thighs shapeless where the little-girl fat had not cleared away . But Cissy , if she lived to be a hundred , would never have an inch of flesh that would hold a candle to Marcia Mae . Marcia Mae 's ankle shot down as straight and trim as a blade , and it was fleet : even in repose it ran and halted to make the stroke and ran again . A certain clean physical intonation of superiority  --  carriage , people say  --  she would have perhaps had anyway , being well-born , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the neck 's pride  --  all these she had earned without knowing it , climbing high into the grape arbor , racing with Negro children to see the minstrel parade , swinging whole mornings through out in the pasture swing . When the yard and the woods and the Negro children fell away into a dream world ( though they were all still there , the sense of them had vanished ) , she had gone on to tennis and in college spent more time in the swimming pool , they said , than in class . On her idle wrist now a round gold watch no bigger than a dime was bound by a gold snake chain . She glanced at it now and again . Before the two girls the level side lawn spread away like a gracious open fan . Its grass was soft gray-green , rich this year by reason of the wet spring . The black shadows which embossed it fell where they would : feathery , but in grand possession , towarddawn , lightly sustaining the big dew , they shrank up tightp163and black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereaboutswhen the sun shot a glare through , this being the only hour you could not enjoy sitting out in the yard . Flowering shrubs flourished in their accustomed places , deep-rooted and assured as trees . There were a few flower beds near the porch steps and one or two far out , very far , there where the bluff dropped suddenly and Jason Hunt had strung a white-painted chain for fear someone might fall in the dark  --  he could even be sued . Not much was blooming now at this high point of summer with all its layered green and shadow . Roses were in bloom , and certain stiff commonflowers like zinnias and marigolds , but none of these were on the lawn . It seemed to have had its own way about things , and if it had rejected roses , that was that . The fact was , however , that the lawn took a terrible amount of labor . Nan Hunt talked about it so much nobody heard her any more . She was out every morning in a large straw hat , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who drove her to distraction . She would n't " get rid of him " because he had a " growing hand , " but you had to " keep in behind him " because he was " not worth killing . " He cost her a great deal of anguish , and after dinner every day ran the power mower , a wonderfully sleepy sound for napping . His name was George , and right now he was sitting on the far side of the cedar tree out back of the kitchen , dozing . He was the same who used to play with Marcia Mae and had pushed her in the swing so many times , including the day the rope broke on the rise and slung her up so high and she looked down out of mid-air and saw a boy throw down his gun and run and wondered why he did it . A bumblebee warred twice against the porch screen ; a green lizard ran across a flagstone . With effort like rising out of deep waters , Marcia Mae reheardher own last voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . Maybe I would like her just fine . I do n't know . " " You could go call on her , " Cissy suggested . " Damn it , Marjorie Angeline , " for this was Cissy 's true outlandish name , " I 'll go to see who I please . "  |p164Cissy  yawned again . " I wish I had a Coke . I 'm sleepy . " " So do I. Go get us one . " " My nails are n't dry . Besides , I ca n't go through the livingroom without speaking to whoever is in there with Mother . " " You could go around the house , " suggested Marcia Mae . " Umm , " said Cissy , meaning that she did n't want to . Marcia Mae stood up and , tucking her shirt into her shorts , caught up a wrap-around skirt from the back of her chair . " Going for a walk ? " Cissy ventured . But her sister did not seem to have heard her . " Now Mother will make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 'll survive , " said Marcia Mae , and went off arrow-straight across the lawn . The path lowered her , gently at first , then quickly ; her high bright head vanished downward among the trees . Little by little , only as much each time they met as her pride would allow , Marcia Mae had told Duncan about her life away from Lacey . Slowly , she had brought herself to admit that this was why she had come home , to tell him everything . He was the only one to hear that behind the high proud look she had wheneverRed O'Donnell was mentioned , lived the memory of a marriage that had not been a raging success . The big handsome Irishman had loved to drink and party ; he had loved the figure he cut in Marine officer 's uniform . He thought his Southern bride was the prettiest girl he 'd ever seen , and because he had always lived in California , he was pleased to be ordered to the San Diego Marine base . For the first few months he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to weigh on him . He was assigned to paper work at the base , which bored him ; his opinion of hisp165superior took hours to describe and he described it every night when he got home . On weekends he felt it necessary for them to go to parties with other young married couples of the service . He could whip a party together in no time , inviting along as his best friends in creation people whom he had met a few hours before in a bar . These people , Marcia Mae said , invariably seemed all right ; they were attractive , well-dressed , well-paid , often amusing . She learned that after a certain point in the evening 's drinking it was best not to enter any bedroom . Once after midnightshe discovered that when looking for an ash tray it was more tactful not to walk back of the sofa . One night Red vanished for several hours with a movie bit actress somebody had brought along ; he claimed afterwards not to have remembered anythingafter ten o'clock . They had a terrible fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moreover expected her to be angry with him , but not for very long . A day or two later , his ex-wife appeared . He had never mentioned that he had one . They still owned some property together in Los Angeles and what she had in mind was that he make over the property to her in lieu of back alimony . " I do n't really owe her any alimony , " Red explained to Marcia Mae . " I was just supposed to pay it till she married again and she married inside two months . But now she 's got another divorce , so she claims I have to start paying her again . If anybody ought to have alimony it was me . " And he would plunge into the long list of her faults . When she telephoned , however , which was often , he became as docile as you please and made appointments with her to discuss business or see lawyers . Marcia Mae put her foot down . " You either stay with me or go back to her , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her ? " " Oh , no , " he said dolefully . " She spends too much money . " He was sitting on the couch in the living room of the duplex they lived in , and was heartily worrying about himself . Marcia Mae burst right out laughing . From that moment she stopped believing that she loved him or ever had . " You get rid of her , " he begged . " You start answering the phone and sayp166I 'm out of town . " She seemed not to be able to stop laughing . He was finally offended . " I do n't see what 's so funny , " he said . " The joke is on me , " she told him . " I left the best man in the state of Mississippi for you  --  for this . " She began to think of leaving him , but she was too hardheadedto do it right away ; she hated the thought of the news going back home , of the people who would say " Uh-huh , I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she learned to be fond of him in a way , the way one feels for a child after taking care of it for a time . " Which only proves , " she told Duncan , " that I never loved him . I was never hurt enough . " His orders came , and he was gone . On shipboard he wrote her two passionate letters in a style not quite illiterate , begging her pardon for everything and saying how sweet she was . She had to admit that she cried over them . One day she came back walking from the grocery store to their duplex on a sunny California winter day and saw the telegramon the table where the cleaning woman had left it . She knew already what it said . She put some coffee on the stove first , thinking that if the coffee was going before she read it , then afterward she would have to do something about the coffee . Later she went to the beach in the car Red had left with her and walked by the sea for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telegram had merely stated a fact . Finally a picture formed quite clearly in her head . There had been ten men gathered in a fringe of palms just off the beachhead at Tarawa . A grenade had come bouncing out of the jungle and rolled at their feet ; it was seconds from detonation . Nine of the men had plunged to earth , face downward , clutching into the ground , but the tenth had leaped deliberately upon it and had been blown to smithereens . She could imagine the island : palm trees rising in a proud disheveled way , strong sun , the sea and white curling foam , the square-nosed landing craft rolling in and every so often a bright flash of fire . And there at center stood ten men just before a moment of impetuous decision . She was linkedp167back to the time she had first laid eyes on Red O'Donnell , a carelessly handsome man walking straight toward her the moment he set eyes on her at a soldier 's dance , saying in his confident Yankee way , " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty minutes later , " You do n't know it yet , but you 're going to marry Inc . " It was his sense of freedom that had drawn her . Of course , he would jump on a grenade if he wanted to . Now he was a war hero . The nine men he had saved appeared one at a time or in pairs , always in dress uniform , presented themselves with great formality and told her their stories , turning the Marine dress cap in their big hands and sitting forward on the edge of the sofa . Then , very likely , the man next door in the duplex would knock and say , " The Missus thought you might like this , " and it would be an upsidedowncake or a pot of Brunswick stew or half a lamb roast . Then the Marine would be persuaded to stay . Life for Marcia Mae at that point entered a kind of beautiful vacuum . The woman next door cooked herself crazy , the sun shone , the flowers bloomed , the men Red had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red had left ran like a dream . She was out on the beach for a picnic one night with the ninth and last one . The sun had set far out over the ocean , and she said , " Now it will go on to Tarawa , and shine on the beach there and the sea and the little bit of jungle with the palm trees , just exactly the way it was shining when Red blew himself up . " So the ninth man said , " Who told you the sun was shining ? " She could n't remember . " It was rainy , " said the Marine , " with a heavy wind , the tail of a typhoon , we kept saying . Things were confused . I kept thinking I had forgotten something . It was hard to do the simplest thing . Salt water blew down my back . I was sitting by O'Donnell in the LCI coming in , and I said , There 's salt water down my back , for Christ 's sake , ' and he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Marcia Mae , " I do n't see what difference it makes whether he got blown up in the sun or in the rain . " She said , " I do n't see why either , but it does . " She asked him , " Whenp168are you going home ? " " It 's like I told you , " he said , " I do n't want to leave you ever at all . " " Yes , " she said , " but think of what you 've got back home , " because she had heard all this from eight before him , and knew exactly how to impress it on him . " There is the wife and kids , " he said . " I guess responsibility is what you might call it . " " I think you might , " she agreed . With the illusion of the sunlit explosion , her last hold on a dream vanished too . Her husband 's valor was extensively publicizedand she found that the woman next door was not the only one eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business course , got good jobs one after another , keeping them only so long as they interested her . She was twice engaged , but her enthusiasm waned decidedly each time . One day she came back to Lacey . Now that she was very near the end of telling Duncan Harper everything she could remember of her years away , she wondered what would happen next . Walking , she came from the woods into open pasture , took off the skirt that had shielded her legs from scratches and some idea about snakes , and threw it over her head for protection against the July afternoon sun . As she came down to cross the branch by one of the many small fords the cattle made , she heard footsteps approaching from a path hidden in trees . She withdrew along the sandy stream , concealing herself in a thicket that came down into the water . A Negro boy came into view , carrying a molasses bucket full of blackberries in either hand . She watched the innocent gliding white of his eyeball . The tin bucket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water sucked and sloshed into the diamond-shaped cut-out places in his rubber boots . The rich black fruit lay piled above the buckets ' mouths , but the boy 's easy stride held every berry safe . She knew the way of a wood enough to know he could not possibly see her . How was it he made her feel that he knew she was there ? She waited till his footsteps died quite away on the roll of pasture behind her . Then for motion there was only a buzzard , high up , asleep on the air , and for sound a cricket that woke ,  |p169wound  once , then drowsed again . Every leaf , grass blade , and twigged arm of brush seemed hushed in contemplation of the heat , and motion went so against this prevalence that it took a penalty : she was wet with sweat and trembling when she gained the top of the bluff and saw the car waiting for her where the old road forked . Black spots danced before her eyes . When she saw no one inside , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much hot metal he had gone a short distance away to the edge of the bluff and was sitting in the shade of an old beech tree . He had taken off his coat and rolled up his sleeves . Sun through the narrow leaves speckled his arms and turned the hairs golden . She came to him and he drew her down and close to him with one arm . " You 're shaking . What 's the matter ? " " I thought I would have a sunstroke . " Their voices had fallen at once to whispers . They clung together ; kissing , their heads sank against the tree trunk . At last she pulled apart from him and straightened , saying , " How awful in this weather . It makes me feel like a bitch . " " You looked worried when you came up the path . I was watching you . " " Cissy has been baiting me again , the disgusting child ! You ca n't tell me she does n't know I see you . Coming through the pasture I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I saw the car without you in it , I thought at first it must be some , one else 's car and we 'd be trapped . " " You 're having a hard day . " She broke a twig between her fingers . " I do n't actually feel guilty myself . I feel that other people are trying to make me say I 'm wrong whether I think so or not . I 've always hated that about Lacey . They all know how right they are . Anybody who disagrees is wrong . Why should n't I see you ? Who else is there in the world I 'd want to talk to ? If we want to meet for dinner right uptown in the cafe and sit there till closing time , whose business is it to have any opinion about it ? " He did not mention whose business it could be said to be , butp170only observed , " It might be a little hard to convince anybody , sure enough , that the only thing between us was conversation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor in his tone was too familiar and dear , and what he said was true . She laughed in spite of herself . " Oh , Duncan , I do love you . I know you love me , even if you wo n't tell me so . " A cricket wound a dry spiral of sound into the heat . She was forever coming at him in a new way with this question . She raised her eyes to his and caught him watching her with the worried , removed look people have for sick children . " I knew you had to see me , Marcia Mae . I knew that all along . " " You 're going to make it out you were only doing your duty ! " She hurled down a handful of broken twigs . " You 're the most dishonest person I 've ever known . " " All right , just suppose I said , Yes , I love you , I 'll never leave you ! What next ? What would you want me to do about it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought we could be happy staying here . Beyond that  --  " She made a little gesture . " I do n't want to try to run your life for you . " He laughed . " You just want me to leave my family and home and business . Beyond that I 'm perfectly free . " " Nobody made you find me that Sunday in the woods ! Nobody made you show up today , no , nor any other day ! " They fell unhappily silent . She spread out her wrap-around skirt and lay on it face downward , propped on her elbows . She pulled up grass , clearing a little bare space to draw in with a stick . " How is Jimmy Tallant ? " she inquired . " About the same . It 's touch and go . I stopped by the hospital this morning and they let me in to talk to him for a minute . He still says some strange white man shot him . " " Everybody thinks it was that Negro . Even the Negroes think so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think so , " said Duncan.  | " You think it was some white man Jimmy Tallant never saw before and nobody has ever seen since ? " " I think Tallant and Grantham were up to their necks in crooked business . It could have been any number of people . " " The first person there was Tinker , was n't it ? What does she say ? " " Just what she always said . That she was at Dozer 's when he ran in and said Jimmy had been shot . Nobody was with Jimmy when Tinker got to him . Bud Grantham contends that Dozer did it , though he did n't see it happen . " Marcia Mae wrote " Tinker " on the bare space of ground , then erased it with her fist . Duncan ground out a cigarette under his heel . " She 'd tell me anything she knew . " " Listen ! " said Marcia Mae and looked up from writing " Duncan " on the ground . " I thought I heard someone . " " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always expect people to jump out of trees on us . I always feel better inside . " He stood up presently , knocking the dust from his trousers , and put down his hand to her . " We 'll go inside then . " They walked together up a disused , shady path which gave on an open space with a deserted Negro house . The gate was broken in , the yard weed-grown ; gigantic purplish-crimson Negro plants , the kind called " prince feathers , " plumed above the steps and the floor of the sagging porch . Marcia Mae had found the house and had first brought them there . If they were happier going down the familiar path together than they had been so far that day , it was perhaps because they had come to equal terms in a commonattraction . Marcia Mae realized this , and wondered if he came with her only to give her , generously , this sense of an equality they had lost . The thought depressed her ; she forgot it , but it returned again when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little pile of cotton left over from last year 's picking  --  they had found it inp172the only room of the house not full of wasps . The shadows had lengthened , streaking the bare dusty floor . They had not spoken for a long time ; then Duncan turned abruptly to her from the window , demanding , " Why did you leave me ? Why ? " There was finality in his voice ; this time he would have to know . Looking toward him in surprise , she understood that his need to see her had been as great as hers for him . She saw hiswould have to try to answer him . At the time , ten years before , her reasons had all seemed very clear , but now there was no one answer she could give him . She could see what she had done only in terms of what she remembered , and she did all she could , which was to start remembering again . " That summer , " she said . " That awful summer . " " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Everett . Early in June . " " We had to put off the wedding . " " I remember . " " There is one thing I have to say that nobody has ever said . " She sat up . " It 's better Everett died . Nobody would come out and say so , but everybody thought it . You would n't say so either . " He winced , turning away . " If everybody does know things Iike that , what 's the good of saying them ? It seems kinder not to . " " Kind ! Duncan , I saw with my own eyes how glad Daddy was when Everett died . Mother felt it , and all the love she 'd had for Everett , the weak one , her only son , turned into hate for Jason . She was left living with the man who 'd killed him  --  " " Killed him ? " " Wanted him dead . People hear wishes as loud as guns . " searching baffled eyes and knew that impossible as it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fault , the way Everett was ? " " No , it was Mother 's too . They pulled him two ways . He was sensitive and lazy and clever and he never found himself . Daddy bought him a gun . He made him go deer hunting . They stood on a stand together in the freezing cold and mist from before daylight on till ten and when the deer came by , Daddy shot and said Shoot ' to Everett . Everett was funny when he told me about it . He said he knew the gun had to go off , so somehow or other he jerked the trigger . He said the miracle was that he did n't hit Daddy . He said he could n't have come within a mile of the deer . But when it fell , Daddy , to cheer him up , said , You got him , Son , you got him ! ' Then he dragged him out to where the deer had fallen and was heaving to rise and run again with one leg shattered and the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept a death grip on Everett to keep him from running away , then he slit the deer 's throat with his knife and shoved Everett down to bathe his face in the blood . The old hunter 's ritual , you know . Everett saw the big soft eyes veiling over , and the shattered bone in the leg poking up and Daddy 's hand coming at him with big globs of blood smoking on it . He began to vomit and say , I did n't do it , you did it , you did it ! ' He broke away and ran . He met some of the other hunters coming in to see the kill . They laughed about it . Daddy was humiliated . He told everybody that Everett was sick and he took him home that night . Everett did get sick , as it turned out . Mother stowed him away under hot-water bottles . He was sick all during Christmas . His fever nearly broke the thermometer . Daddy would n't come in the room . When Everett lay in bed recuperating , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taffetas from Grandmother 's rag bag and made Cissy a wonderful doll . It was the prettiest doll I ever saw , a Turkish doll with long balloon pants bound in silver at the ankles and a wicked black mustache . And a fez . Daddy saw Cissy with it and said , Where 'd you get that , Baby ? ' She said , Everett made it for me . ' He reached out his hand to take it . Do n't you touch it , " Mother said . I was there . I saw it all . I felt sorry forp174all of them , but I did n't understand . Now that I understand it , I do n't feel anything any more . Once you know whodunit , you do n't care about the book any longer . They killed him . I understand it . He was miserable . I think it 's better he 's dead . " " I had the impression , " said Duncan , " that Everett died of bronchial pneumonia . " " Yes , but they had set up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got sick . Mother would nurse him . The last time was your fault , actually . " " Me ! What on earth do you mean ? " " He had finished college . He was supposed to go to work , find a job , do something . Life was closing in on him , tightening over him like a fist . He wandered out of one room and into anotherand read in stuffy corners . The summer got hotter and hotter . Daddy would n't look at him . I was too kind to him . Grandmotherwas knitting him some Argyle socks . Mother planned the meals just for him . " He used to ride around in the car with us at night . I thought he enjoyed that . We 'd make him quote us poetry . He never seemed to want to go home . " He did n't want to leave us alone because he did n't want us to make love . He was in love with you , Duncan . Now do n't deny you knew it . " He did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she continued , " or out near the sundial beyond the cedars or in first one room and then the other where the sun had left for the day  --  there are lots of rooms in our house  --  I ca n't tell you just how many there are right off , because when I 'm away I remember some at times and others at other times  --  but it does seem to me when Everett died he took with him some rooms I ca n't find any more . He had an imagination and it was always going  --  imagining , imagining . That 's different from thinking . It pulls everybody off base , makes them nervous . When it 's going on in one room , the room you 're in looks dead and plain because that other one is so alive . So hep175drank too much , standing on the back porch sipping whisky through the long sweet awful dusks , and read every book not only in our house but in the library and all he could borrow from other people in town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the last one that we had all gone away . I was in Clark for fittings on my trousseau , and Mother and your mother were up at the church to talk about decorations . The house was empty and you were in your empty house . He got up and went to you . " " I never told that to a soul , Marcia Mae , not even you . " " He told me himself when his fever got high . IIe kept saying , ' Duncan hates me now , I know Duncan hates me , ' and I would say , ' Why , Everett ? ' and he would say , ' I saw him in his house and now he hates me . ' When he died and I knew Daddy was glad , that was when I tried to get you to run away with me . Do you re-member ? " " We were sitting in the yard , " he recalled , " in that double swing where Everett used to read books all afternoon . My mother came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourth time she 'd been to call since the funeral , then you said you were n't going to be nice about it , that the reason she came was that she loved being in with the Standsbury family . You said you were sick of everybody agreeing to cover up the plain truth by being nice to one another . Then you said we had to leave home . " " It was a day a lot like this one : hot , shady , beautiful , still . The lawn was lovely and the house was quiet . You could even think that death was something like poetry . When the swing went back I thought , With all this horror in people how can things look so beautiful ? and when the swing went forward I thought , It is so beautiful maybe the horror is n't real , and then I put my foot on the ground and stopped the swing , because I saw them both , both together , the beauty and the horror , like one gorgeous rotten fruit . That was when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an absolute conviction of it . " " The only thing you did n't consider was that your having anp176absolute conviction of something did not mean that I would have it too . You threw it all at me at once . " " Just as it came to me , right in the swing . " " You wanted me to sell the grocery store and my property , and we would take the money and go West , take one of the coaching jobs I kept getting letters about , wait till my draft number was called . Then you would follow me around to army camps or , if I went overseas , you would get a defense job and wait for me to come back and then  --  and then what ? I forget . " " Oh , just that we 'd start from nothing but ourselves , clean , out West somewhere . We could n't stay in the South and be free. - In the South it 's nothing but family , family . We could n't breathe even , until we left . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you guess it 's too soon after the funeral for us to go to a nice cool movie ? ' " " At that point you jumped up , slapped me in the face , and walked into the house . From then on I never had any peace . You said we had to leave , that I did n't know a bad thing when I saw it . " " You were very patient . You said you were all your mother had , that your property was all here , that Jason had already turned over some of his business to you , that he would make over more in time , that we would have a house of our own  --  way across town all by ourselves  --  imagine ! You said I was just upset over Everett . " She paused until he looked at her . " If there 's anything these ten years prove , Duncan , I hope at least you know now that I wasnot just upset over Everett . " He did not reply to her vigor , her assertiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " I failed to understand you . Is that what you 're saying ? " " It was n't only me you failed to understand . It was every-thing . " But she had softened . She studied the lines around his eyes , running back into the boyish fuzz of hair that his blondness kept , shading out a more definite hairline . She pressed up the skin ofp177his brow and watched the long horizontal lines disappear , and then as her hand relaxed saw their inevitable return . " Before he died , " she went on finally , " Everett thought there were soldiers out by the summerhouse . They were in ragged clothes , he said , all gathered around somebody or something on the ground , and talking , until one left and ran toward the house . This was a hot afternoon . It had threatened a storm at dinner , but it blew over , then things seemed drier and stiller than before . Flies had come into the house . The soldier went past the corner of the porch . Everett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother told how during the Civil War some soldiers had stopped on the lawn . One of them was sick and they were afraid he had cholera . They would n't bring him in the house , but one of them finally came to ask for water and food . She could n't recall the rest of the story . " She said : " The day I really left you , I did n't have any idea I was doing it . I walked out of the house just before the afternoon broke . Those were long days after Everett died . It seemed that the heat would never climb high enough , satisfy itself enough , to start down again . Mother had to start taking shots for her headaches . Daddy kept right on calling you in to talk business . We had let them put the wedding off three months . There was a war in Europe . You said we could n't hurt the family now , we ought to help them . Mother was asleep in a pitch-black room . I thought I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walked down through the cedars and out into the sun . I had not walked to town since I was a child . People looked at me on the street without speaking , it seemed so odd to see Marcia Mae Hunt walking . I had forgotten how broken the old sidewalks were , with cow hooves printed in them . I thought I would buy a Coke at the drugstore and walk back home , then I saw at the drugstore that the Greyhound bus was in . It was going East . So I got on it and rode over to Stark . " As I was drinking another Coke at the Stark drugstore , I saw a sign up that said there was a dance at Willett Hill for thep178members of the armed forces . It said the bus would stop at the schoolhouse at seven to pick up the girls from Stark . I drank the Coke and went to the movies and ate popcorn . Then I ate a hamburger in the cafe . And a piece of coconut pie . I was just on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls were all dressed up in low-cut peasant blouses . They had artificial flowers pinned in their hair and too much black lipstick on . They also wore fancy strapped sandals and had their toenails painted . But they were mainly country girls , you know , and had n't done any of this in too wise a way . They seemed to feel sorry for me , because I had on a tailored cotton skirt and shirt and scarcely any make-up . Finally one of them pulled a spare artificial flower out of her bag and offered it to me . It was a red poppy and smelled of dime-store powder . I thought at first I would put it in my hair if it killed me , but then I knew I could n't . Whatever I meant by going off like that , it was n't for a pack of country girls to call me Hun ' and offer me Dentyne . " At the dance they all left me and herded in little bunches on one side of the room and giggled , waiting for the soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead , began to ask me to dance . For one thing , I was alone ; for another , I was a blonde . It never hurt anything , being a blonde . The little soldiers were sweet , touching somehow , like Confederate soldiers are , and I remembered the soldiers Everett saw on the lawn , though you did n't believe he saw them . We argued and argued , you remember ? It was Jimmy Tallant who said , For Christ 's sake , Duncan , let her believe it if she wants to . ' And you said , I do n't care if she believes it ; she wants me to believe it too . ' " Duncan recalled , " And Tallant yelled , Well , believe it too then , for Christ 's sake ! ' We were all over at Stark at the cafe , and all a little tight on beer . " " Tinker said , I believe it , Marcia Mae . ' " After a silence , Marcia Mae added , " She has a soft voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tallant live or die ? "  | " They still ca n't say . " " I looked for you that summer , Duncan . I looked and looked . I trailed every scent like a bloodhound and bayed all night at empty trees . I wanted , passionately , for you to understand . If I could have showed you once why we had to get away , that they were turning our love into a complicated family thing , that they had killed Everett and oh , you kept going to talk business with Daddy and saying that Everett was out of his head with high fever , and you did n't , could n't , would n't understand ! " " I suppose Red O'Donnell understood perfectly , " said Duncan . " That 's funny , " she said , " I never once expected him to . He was a Yankee . " She said : " He was n't even supposed to be at the dance . He was a Marine on a three-day pass from the Pensacola base , determined to hitch-hike as far through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a ride . He had waited an hour in Willett Hill for a ride and when nobody stopped he kept reading the sign for the soldiers ' dance . Finally he thought , If nobody comes along for another fifteen minutes , I 'll go to the dance . He went and there I was . We called it destiny . " We left the dance . We went to an all-night cafe and tourist court out at the highway junction . We kept drinking whisky in a booth . I kept getting him to talk to me . He might have been a creature from Mars . He had no consciousness of families , small towns , roots , ties , or any sort of custom . I expected lightning to strike him . I had always taken so much for granted . I had never gone with anyone but you . I thought I knew everything , but here was someone unconcerned with everything I knew . I wo n't deny remembering anything about it , though some of it was always awfully vague , but I woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cold sober , saying , Marcia Mae Hunt , what are you doing here ? ' I did exactly what I told myself to do and came straight home . On the bus . The driver let me off at the corner . " It was a warm night with a moon , very sweet . I remember itp180so well . I was tired and the house had never looked so good . I thought , Well , what a crazy thing I did . White houses in the South in the summer at night , with all the big trees so dark and deep , they float , you know , and the sweet air that comes through the window and over your bed " Well , unfortunately , there was a light on upstairs . Mother was worried ; she had thought I was out with you , but you had called around eight , then some lady in town called and asked Mother why I went to Stark on the bus and an old friend of Mother 's from Stark called and asked what I was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then Mother called you back and promised to make me call you the minute I came in . All this that night . The next morning a cousin from Willett Hill telephoned to say she had heard but could not believe that I had come to the soldier 's dance alone , and by afternoon you and Daddy had had a conference about just how upset was I really over Everett 's death , and afterwards I saw you and said , Let 's get out of here , let 's go now . ' You said , Marcia Mae , I 'm pretty damn sick of your carrying on this way . ' You said , You might as well realize that I 'm not going one step anywhere , and you are n't either . ' Mother was calling out of the bedroom to remind me for the fourth time that I had n't been uptown to get the mail  --  she still did n't think it proper for her to go about . She had a great greed for sympathy notes and kept getting them from old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Are you going to run uptown for your mother , or do I have to do it ? ' And I looked at you and knew you thought there was nothing on the face of the earth that ought to stand in the way of my going uptown for the mail . I despised you , Duncan , for the first and last time . It was an awful feeling . " So I went uptown to get the mail . " Red O'Donnell was standing out in front of the drugstore where the bus had dropped him . He had sweated out his only two shirts and had bought a plaid cotton sports shirt . Westerners are like that ; they 'll wear whatever they feel like wearing . They thinkp181it 's nobody 's business what they have on . I was never so glad to see anyone . He could have been in overalls . I thought the best thing I 'd ever done was get drunk and go to a tourist court with a strange Marine . I thought , At least he 's free . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Then I thought , I love him . " It was not clear at what point twilight had commenced its serious summer ritual . Already the shadowy , dusty room seemed a reflected place and silence a spell impossible to break by any means close at hand . Then they heard the bump against the door . They had already decided what they would do if anybody came along . They had discovered a small windowless room , a storeroom perhaps , or closet , set between the two larger rooms . Marcia Mae was to close herself inside there while Duncan got rid of whoever it was . When he heard the sound he was instantly on his feet , bringingher up with him , and as she showed alarmingly no inclination to stir , he pushed her toward the little low door . The sound came again , but louder and with more intention , a thud and shove against the door 's lower half , as if someone struck a knee there . Duncan walked directly forward then , removed the wooden peg from the latch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mongrel hound the color of the Mississippi River , whose hide was nothing but a coat of paint over the skeleton , and whose eyes were totally prepared for human life , understanding at one time both the giant succulent unplucked hambone and the dishpan full of scalding water . The hindquarterswere set low at a bias , alert to dodge and flee ; while one forepaw rested bravely , even handsomely , and the other was lifted in all the gentility of prayer . His nose had pushed the door . " It 's just a dog , " he turned to call to her , but saw she had not moved to hide . He flushed with annoyance at her , but before he could speak they both grew suddenly ashamed ; so he stepped outside and , sitting on the door sill , began to coax the dog back to him . The animal came in low to the ground , the tail waggingp182between his legs . Speaking quietly , Duncan was at last allowed to stroke the low head . Marcia Mae sat down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's shaking all over , poor thing , " she said compassionately , but when her hand moved the dog leaped away , and would not return , though he longed to . " You frightened him , " said Duncan . " You put out your hand too fast . Here , boy . Here . " He whistled softly . " He probably lived here , " he went on , " else why would he be trying to come into a house where there is n't any smell of food ? Probably when the family left here to go to Detroit and work in the dee-fense plant , they had to leave him . " " Yes , " she said , " only that would be so long ago . " " They say they do n't forget , " said Duncan . " It 's the hound blood . " " We sit here mourning over a damn nigger dog , " she said , " as though we had nothing better to bother us . " The dog crept halfway in and lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he would have belonged to them . When it grew as dark outside as it had been inside the cabin , they walked back to the car . The dog hovered , following at greater and greater distances , until their departure left him alone with his hour 's bewilderment of heart . When he drove back to Lacey , Duncan did not go immediately home . He noticed with relief that his mother 's house looked empty , so he stopped there and went inside , walking into the unlocked hallway and back to his old room , the one she kept just as he had always had it . Duncan was an only child . The room was almost dark , but he did not switch on the lamp . He sat down in the straight chair at his old high-school desk , his head lowered . There was always with Marcia Mae the problemp183of her vividness : whether she fell out of the sky at him or climbed up a hill to meet him , it took a while for him to right himself . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and had sat for a time on the front seat beside him . At last she said , " Duncan , I can not bear this sneaking and hiding and deceiving . " " You do n't see how it is . " " No , I do n't , " she said . " One other thing I ca n't bear is to say goodbye . " She jumped out and ran away down the hill before he could say a word . His first impulse had been to follow her , but he did not quite obey it ; then it was too late . He had watched her hair , combed simply back behind her ears , toss from side to side as she ran . He could see it still . She had not looked back once . He faced it now , admitting that what they had had was over ; that they had reached the end of what they had to tell . He wondered if he was any nearer answering what he had asked himself so often : " Why did she leave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew . He tried to bring all of it into one statement . She had left him because he would not run away with her and be free from the evil she saw in her family and in the whole South . It would n't do to think , Marcia Mae is just that way : emotional and sudden and proud . She did see something different from what he saw , and had tried in vain to show it to him ; like pointing out something on the edge of a distant wood , the effort had come to nothing . He did not believe that the Hunts were worse than anybody else , or that you escaped from anything when you left Lacey and the South . Still it was what she saw and what he did not see that had torn them apart . He remembered his father , a patient , soft-spoken man , trying to read the paper after supper while his great-uncle Phillip walked up and down the room saying that the New Deal was unconstitutional . " I tell you , Henry , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , " I can endure poverty , I can endure starvation . Let tenp184thousand depressions sweep down upon us ! I take my stand upon the Constitution ! That man is promising bread , jobs , and easy money in return for our freedom ! Do you realize it , Henry ? Do you realize what this means ? " " How can you stand it every night ? " Duncan heard his mother ask once while his father stood in his nightshirt , about to switch the light off . " If you try to stop it , he only gets worse , " he said . " If you really cross him , he 'll move out again . " Uncle Phillip had done them that way once because Duncan 's mother had twice forgotten to send his linen to the washerwoman . " Woman ! " he had risen from the table announcing , " the same roof shall shelter us no longer ! " He had moved down to the hotel . Duncan 's father let him go , refused to discuss him even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him home for supper . He came meekly , this terror of children uptown on the square , possibly driven on by the strings the hotel cook left in the beans . Mrs. Harper , standing at the front window with her little boy , said , " Oh , mercy , your father 's got him back . Look how well your father walks , " she said with pride . " He 's a gentleman . " They watched while Henry opened the gate for Uncle Phillip , who leaned back on his walking stick and huffed a moment from the climb . " I do believe that Uncle Phillip 's getting old , " said Mrs. Harper wistfully . " Run put another plate on the table . " There was never any doubt that it was in Duncan 's father 's mild grasp that the stability of the family lay . He had died when Duncan was in high school , surviving Uncle Phillip by two years . Though he had married late , a much younger lady , he was still not an old man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their last two years as a family had been unquestionably happy . Released from the burden of Uncle Phillip , Henry Harper spread himself amiably among old friends . He was proud of his finelookingboy who was attracting notice everywhere the way he played football . It amused him that Jason Hunt sometimes stopped in the store to talk . Though he never said so , he was conscious thatp185back in the old days Hunts used to come to town on Saturday in a wagon , wearing shoes for the first time that week . But Jason had been a smart one : he had set out to marry a Standsbury , and he had done it . His daughter was pretty enough ; everybody said how nice she looked with Duncan . One day in the early fall Duncan had come home from footballpractice and been surprised to see his father 's hat and cane on the hall tree . He found his father lying down . He lay in his shirtsleeves and suspenders , his button collar open at the throat . " I felt a little tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little before supper . " " Do you need anything ? Are you sick ? " " No , just tired . Where 's your mother ? " " It must be Auxiliary day . " " It always is , " said Henry Harper , and smiled . This was a joke they shared . Duncan went back to the kitchen for a drink of water . From the back porch he looked out on a familiar calm stretch of yard , dropping down to a barn , a chicken yard , and a small orchard . He smelled the dusty stir of autumn in the twilight  --  it always said football to him and school opening  --  and there was that other quality beneath the eagerness and color that tried to speak and could not , so he had never known what it was , except that it was sad . He heard his mother come in , and presently she called him from the bedroom . His father had just died . So ever after he knew that the name of the other quality in autumn was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad  --  there was nothing terribleabout it . He did not believe that he and his father would ever have quarreled . In what small light was left he looked about him , noting withoutfurther interest his cabinet of football trophies , the big handsomely bound book of newspaper clippings resting on a special shelf . In the closet he found another book he had suddenlyremembered ; it was really a large folder , and inside were crumbling samples of insect life , butterflies , moths , and such like , mounted on stiff sheets and labeled . This had been his Boy Scout project one summer and some of the lettering , he recognized , hadp186been put there by Tinker Taylor , who had been helping him . " I declare , " his mother said one day after Tinker had gone home , " that girl is just crazy about you . That child ! " Maybe football had n't been such a good thing after all , he thought , taking comfort from the careful , loving uprightness of the lettering that she had done for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switched out the lamp , and left , passing in the hall the door to the room where his father had died . His mother still had not come home . Maybe this too was Auxiliary day . He considered that he knew himself by certain things , by their certain manner of being themselves that identified them with his deepest self . He wanted , positively now , to go home to his wife and children . Duncan Harper was a citizen of Lacey , that was it . Just answering a question about love could not alter this fact . Just saying " Come away " could not change it . It was his strongest and final quality . He found his family all together in the kitchen . Tinker was gettingsupper and talking to both children at once  --  they were forever carrying on conversations with her on two completely different subjects , each unaware that the other was speaking at all . Cotton , who was standing near the door , was interrupted in a long story by the sense of someone near him . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're getting tall as I am , " Duncan said . " How tall are you ? " " No , precious , " said Tinker to Patsy , who was sticking her finger in the biscuit dough . " It is n't good to eat . " " Tinker , I  --  "  |p187She  glanced up . The wooden spoon continued to move rapidly . She was the instant before turning the dough out to knead . " People have been calling you all afternoon . If you look on the phone table . " He lied automatically . " I was up at Mama 's . " She stopped dead . " Why do n't you move up there ? Why do n't you eat up there too ? Is n't her cooking better than mine ? " " Hush , Tinker  --  the children . I want us to talk  --  I want to tell you  --  " " Yes , the children , " she said , louder than before . " See how they 've grown . Can you think of their names ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she flinched and ran backward from him . It was when she released her hold on the spoon and pan that she seemed to turn wild . " Tinker ! Darling , listen  --  ! " " Darling ! ' You 've got me mixed up ! " The next step forward he took , she snatched an empty preservesjar from the shelf and hurled it at him , and after that a potato , which struck him painfully , just below the eye . Her hand seemed about to pick up a large knife , but just then she gasped , whirled , and dashed down the back steps into the dark . Patsy shrieked and ran after her , but the screen door whammed to in her face . She started wailing . Cotton only blenched and clung to the wall exactly where he stood , as though the house itself had tilted . Something boiled over on the stove . " Turn it off , " his father told him , pointing him relentlessly into the cloud of steam , then he too ran out into the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into the loft . He tried to follow but two steps broke under his weight and the whole structure quivered flimsily . She crouched in the dark above him like a small animal run to its den . He could hear her breathing and see what looked to be the glint of her eyes . He was forced to remember how people said her mother one day had picked up and left old Gains because he would n't stop drivingp188the Model T around and blowing the horn . She had taken Tinker and simply repossessed the house she had lived in as a child , was still in it . The town had therefore judged Mrs. Taylor crazy ; they said she was " off . " And Tinker herself had run away home from the playground at recess because they 'd laughed at the suit her mother had made for her from an old " costume . " It was navy wool with big pearl buttons the size of moons . They had worked on it together , her mother teaching her to turn a hem , baste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not " do . " She had run from their terrible laughter , and on the sidewalks heard for a long time , before she would stop or turn , a boy 's steps running and a boy 's voice : " Louise . Louise Taylor . Do n't run so fast . Wait for me . " He had taken her to the drugstore and they had had a Coca-cola , and people told them they ought to be in school . She had looked along the straw , down into the glass where the ice was fading color . " I think your dress is real pretty , Louise . " Still sipping , she raised her eyes full to his , and before the straw could suck in the glass she was in love . " I 'm not going anywhere , Tinker . I 'm never going to leave you . Whatever there 's been is over now  --  over for good . " He could hear her breathing going on from the run , but could n't know what she felt or but what she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no telling what was up there handy . " You ran away another time , remember ? I ran after you . I bought you a Coca-cola , remember ? And Tinker , you remember the summer you helped me make the butterfly book ? It 's still up at Mama 's . I found it today . I could still tell your handwriting . You were a lot of help . " He had made her cry . He could hear her snuffling like a puppy ; she never cried out loud . When she stopped he said , " Louise ? " After a while she crawled to the edge of the loft and looked down into his face . " Duncan , there 's something I never told you . You know the day Jimmy got shot ? I had stopped to see him and four men from New Orleans came there . They wanted to putp189money in the race against you . There was somebody named Sam in charge and Pittman , Pilston , something like that , and another name I ca n't remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She told him all she could think of . " But where were you ? How did you hear this ? " " There 's a bedroom off the office where they were talking . Jimmy hid me in there . " She shook some trash out of her hair . " I would have told you , but I thought it might help you . The last thing I 've wanted to do lately was help you . I 'm coming down now . " She accomplished this without his help , straining every rotten step to the cracking point , though none broke . " But Tinker , all this time , and you never told me . Do n't you realize  --  " " Duncan Harper , if you say another word about it , I 'll go right straight up that ladder again , and I 'll never come down . " When they returned to the house they found it tranquil . Kerney Woolbright , election-weary , thin as a string , was sitting in the living room . " It sure gets my goat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmy Tallant , lying up in the hospital still having blood transfusionsafter two weeks and twice reported dying , has got more power in this damned election than you and me put together . He may be hiding Beck Dozer himself . I 've shaken this county like a persimmon tree , and I ca n't find a single lead to who shot him if it was n't Dozer , and you with everything you can do through the sheriff 's office ca n't find out where Dozer must be hiding . That damn nigger-paper photo stares at me off every goddamn telephone pole . I tell you , Duncan , if we ca n't lay it on the line at the speaking Saturday , we 're licked . " " It so happens something new has come to light , " said Duncan . " I think I know who shot Tallant , and I think I can prove it before the Saturday speaking . " " You what ? But who  --  ? " " I can tell you what it is , but not where I got it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really think we 've got this made . " Tinker discovered the children in the bedroom , being entertained by Bimbo , the colored boy who brought the buttermilk by in the evenings . He had found them sobbing in the kitchen , steam gushing up on the hot stove , and had not only saved the supper but had engrossed both them and himself in a long story : " Man , he got the eyes like this here , and man , he got the long ole swored bill coming out like this , and all pebbled out with little bitty old fine sharp teefies  --  yo ' daddy 's razor blade ai n't no sharper than what them teefies is . And he go zooming in the water when the big old fantail move  --  that 's his motor  --  and every once in a while out of purey dee devilment he come up for air and he jump Ker-flop ! and sound so loud that niggers pickingcotton a mile off in the field looks up and says , You hear that ? There jump that old mean garfish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was sitting on the floor listening with his mouth open , was relieved to see his mother appear in the door ; but Patsy , whose eyes had grown enormous , whispered solemnly , " It 's a great big garfish . " She was seated on Bimbo 's knee , and was staring into his face like a devotee before an idol , and indeed she was to worship him , all her childhood long. 35 ; Jason Takes a HandThe next day was Friday , the day before the big political speaking , and Jason Hunt felt he had put things off as long as he could be expected to . From his office in the wing of his home , he put in a call for Kerney Woolbright and waited there for him , savoringthe summer morning breeze and the smell of dew , which had bent the rich grass . He had a love for the country and could spend time with pleasure by watching simple details of it . Thisp191part of his property reminded him time and again of the country place where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but here and there vines mantled it : jackson vine , virginia creeper , ivy , honeysuckle , and at the rough points farther down the fall , trumpet vine and elderberry . Wisteria clothed his dying cedar ; the mistletoe did not kill his oak , and storms , for all people told him of shallow roots , had yet to bring it down across his house . So when he closed his uptown office ( he called it " retiring " ) , he had built an office here , adding one more wing to an already overgrown , haphazard house , setting himself above the wilder and least tended part of the grounds  --  the lawn his wife fretted over , where garden parties were held and guests strolled , was not visible to him here . It was strange how his family , all within the same walls , had had a tendency to withdraw . Marcia Mae , her high room broodingabovestairs ( he thought she woke at night and smoked ) , his dead son 's room that nobody entered but guests , Cissy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porch with her tester bed she had begged to have and a jungle of scented jars and jugs nobody dared to touch . And Nan , all silken , touching a glass stopper to her ears  --  she kept her room too hot in winter and must darken it when her headaches struck and took her off with them into sufferingnone of them would ever know . Only his mother-in-law 's room stood free of all uncomfortable privacies . Her bed was covered with the patchwork quilt , the old-timey gaudy kind that he liked ; her room was closed only for her afternoon nap . Otherwise , her doors were open all day long , and even at night , as long as the light burned and she lay propped on pillows in a lacy jacket to read first the Bible and then The Ladies ' Home Journal , nobody stopped to knock . Jason contrived to spend part of every day alone with her , and sometimes they did not speak . In his younger days he had considered her a burden . Now he felt simply that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her but to his office with everythingjust as he liked it , and to his yard and trees that seemedp192blessed in an Old Testament way , they flourished so . He could think now of his son without bitterness and of his wife without anger . He had learned you could not rule . Neither , however , could you withdraw entirely so long as God left you about . From experience judgment grew , and must emerge to give the touch where it seemed needed most . This he believed . From his vantage point at the window , he observed the young man hastening up the walk . His face was earnest and his step firm . Jason recalled that he had also watched Duncan Harper approach to his summons , and had always discovered a slight irritationin his big indolent bearing  --  as on the football field , Duncan never seemed to hurry . Facing Duncan 's steady eyes wherein responsibility sat large , Jason had explained the intricate Hunt affairs and felt in the boy an even deeper lack . It was not that Duncan did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have given Jason exactly the same attentionif a country store or a sawmill had been at stake . He had no more sense of greed than a child had lust ; not that Jason approvedof greed , but to have at least the sense of it seemed a proof of manly thinking and developed a firmer hand on the reins . But this second boy was a different matter . Cissy had played the family role where Marcia Mae had not deigned : she " kept him guessing " as every Southern family advises , and politics dazzled before him in the same maddening sort of game . The boy was thin and walked with a stoop and someday soon now the knife-blade wrinkle between the eyes would not go away , even when he smiled . The first hurdles were always the hardest . Jason felt , in short , a likeness to himself in Kerney Woolbright that he had never felt in Duncan Harper . Yet he wished to proceed with caution , for the two were friends and were known as running mates . What had drawn this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Negroes ? Or love of his two daughters ? Jason stripped a cigar and pared it in the wastebasket . He hadp193short attractive hands , browned by the outdoors , and he met Kerney 's practiced political shake with as true a clasp as Winfield County could offer . " Sit down , boy , and talk to me a little . An old man gets to feel all out of it nowadays . " " Sorry I 'm late . I came from town as soon as they told me . " " It 's a bad day to bother you , I 'm afraid . Four days before the primary . " " The funny thing is , sir , I was coming by to talk to you today . I was about to call you up . " " Well , then ! Great minds , and all that . " " Yes , sir , but I 've been wanting to come for some time and talk things over . The trouble has been that Duncan has been busy and I 've been busy , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I finally saw him last night . We 're pretty well committed to taking a similar stand on things . I felt I had to talk with him before I could see you and know I had the right answers . " " And now do you know ? " Kerney smiled . " I think so . Yes , sir . " " It has seemed a little odd to me , " said Jason , toying with a useless sea-shell inkstand from Coral Gables , Florida , which somebody in the family had seen fit to surprise him with , " that you and Duncan have insisted on this partnership , no matter how friendly you may be personally . You 're running for the state senate , he for county sheriff . The territories are not the same , and the two offices are bound to involve different kinds of issues . " " That 's perfectly true , sir . I 've been aware of that all along . But Duncan and I agree there are certain large issues abroad in the state and that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same kind of folks , you might say . We 're young ; we 're college graduates ; we think we represent a type that ought to get into Mississippi politics on every level . It would be natural for people to associate us anyway . We think we 're only taking a fair advantage to join forces on every forward-looking policy . "  | " Umm . And the certain large issues you mentioned , Kerney . We 're back where we were last winter , are n't we ? Right after Travis died , I suggested we work Duncan in as the sheriff appointment . You said then it was Negroes and the prohibition laws that concerned you two most . You said that Duncan wanted a fair deal for Negroes , and that he wanted to shut down Grantham and Tallant . Is that right ? " " Yes , sir , it  --  " " Well , Kerney . Tallant is shut down . There 's no doubt about it . " They were silent . Kerney sat looking at his hands and his brow flushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is that what you mean to say ? " " I could n't help thinking it , " said Jason . " Mr. Jason , if you 're implying that Duncan 's policies are responsible for Jimmy Tallant getting shot , I think you 're being unfair . I  --  " " I never meant to imply anything , Kerney . I merely remarked that one can not help thinking about Tallant now when prohibition is mentioned , just as when you mention Negroes now , one can hardly help thinking about the Dozer Negro who may have tried to murder him . " " Sir , there 's one thing you may not know yet . This is in strictest confidence . Duncan and I have learned that some men from a New Orleans gambling syndicate were up here to see Tallant the afternoon of the shooting . We know there was a quarrel . " " How do you know that ? " " Duncan says he is not at liberty to say . " " Well , what is being done ? " " They will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if possible for attempted manslaughter . " " A slippery question , " said Jason . " Ferreting gangsters out of New Orleans to answer for a small-time fracas in the backwoods.  |p195Even  if they were up here that day , what makes you so sure they did it ? " " The Negro  --  " " The nigger ran . As far as I can see , Kerney , somebody has yet to run after him . " " But Tallant insists the Negro is innocent . " " He would naturally do that . It 's always galled Jimmy that his daddy was the one that shot Dozer 's father . " " Yes , and Duncan feels for that very reason that Beck Dozer would never have fired on Tallant . There 's been a tie between them for years . Duncan says they 've kept each other company about the past . " " Interesting , " said Jason . " But now what ? " " Duncan believes that Beck will come in and give himself up for custody until he can be proved innocent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trust . He thinks if Beck wo n't do this , no Negro in the world will . I 'm tempted to defend him myself if the case should go to court . " He stopped for breath ; his eyes were eager . " If the New Orleans lead yields anything , then Tallant and Grantham will be ruined for good . " Jason said , " You 're clear in your head , of course , what is going to happen to Duncan at the polls ? " " You mean he 's going to lose ? " " People want to vote for Duncan , Kerney , but the fact is that this sort of thing is not going down . You know that , do n't you , when you associate yourself with him ? " " You mean then , that I 'm going to lose , too ? " " People want to vote for you , too , Kerney . They remember how you came out ahead two years ago in the legislature 's race . You were clever to split the vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'd like to vote for you again . There 's nobodyagainst you but old Mavis over in Wyatt County , and people are sick and tired of seeing his face on the posters . I do n't know . Maybe you and Duncan have the right line on this business ,  |p196gangsters  and all . Maybe Dozer is worth the kind of sacrifice you 're making for him . But I certainly think you 'll have to give up entirelyany idea of getting the office you 're supposed to be seeking . " He smiled , his tough-skinned face spilling instantly and graciously all its store of charm . " You 'll forgive me speaking plainly , boy . I 've seen enough of you around the house for quite a while to get to feel like you 're one of the family . With a little urging I might have called myself talking to a son of my own . " Whatever Kerney felt about this did not reveal itself in his face . " Thank you , sir , " he said , adding , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Faced it , yes . But have you thoroughly made up your mind to it ? " " I felt it might be worth  --  " He stopped . He did not look at Jason or avoid him either , and his face became even more deeply his own possession . Kerney Woolbright was neither ugly nor handsome , and though he had the features neither of aristocracy nor of common folk , he might have been placed in either . But above every other quality his face was his own : the large pointed nose , narrow chin cleft in the center , and eyes sheltered deeply in brows and lashes belonged to no one but Kerney Woolbright , a fact that grew more positive every day . " How old are you , Kerney ? " Jason Hunt asked gently . " Twenty-five , sir . " " As young as that ! I thought as much , but it always seems impossible . A college degree , Yale law degree , two years in the legislature , and now  --  well , who knows ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you got ahead of yourself in any way . Some young men do . And some , of course , only sons with a mother alone who has enough money , would say they had responsibilityenough and just sit down , if you follow me . Some stick one toe out in the water and see how cold it is and they 've had enough for the rest of their natural lives . " He laughed . " I was one of a big family . It was never left to me to decide . They snatched me up and threw me in over my head and it was sink or swimp197from then on . If anybody looked back to see which ' one I did , I was too occupied to notice . I 've got a sneaking suspicion , though , that nobody looked . I hope I 've never been the kind of fellow to say everybody has to do it my way or it is n't done right . You 've had a big opportunity for going ahead , and you 've kept the trace chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the money to go to college , I 'd have gone into the law , I always thought , that or medicine . The law is the right thing for stepping off into politics . I thought the other day , You must have seen politics ahead of you all along , Kerney . " " You 're right , sir . I have . " " The same time I wondered that , I was sitting out here in the office by myself watching the cat out there watching a jaybird and the jaybird watching God alone knows what , and I thought , What is Duncan Harper doing in politics ? Is n't this sort of a sudden idea ? " " He 's been interested in politics for a long time , sir . " " Yes , so have I. But I 'm not about to start running for some-thing . " " Travis Brevard asked him  --  " " So they say . Do you think if Travis had had even a sneaking suspicion that Duncan took liberal views , he would have asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was asking a football star , nothing else . " " Duncan knows that , sir . " " What is Duncan living on these days ? The store ca n't be bringing in much with somebody else hired to run it . " " I do n't know about his finances . He still finds time to write a little insurance . I think he has some property in town and maybe a place or two in the country . You know how it is . " " I ought to , " said Jason , and they exchanged a smile . Nobody could name a business in Winfield County that Jason Hunt had not at some time been in it . " He has a nice house , " Jason continued . " Of course , his wife 's father has that oil money . " Kerney was about to speak again , though what he would sayp198seemed uncertain to him , when Jason Hunt rose and spoke with swift strength . " In my opinion Duncan Harper has no business in politics . He is not only inept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every business to be in politics . He has no right to ruin your career , as it will be ruined , Kerney , in this race , for good . " Kerney had risen also . His face flamed completely red ; that was all he showed . " Duncan is my friend , sir , " he said firmly . " I have every respect for friendship , " said Jason Hunt , and put out his hand . " Good day , my boy . Miss Nan and I are always pleased to see you . Come back whenever you can . " 36 , Beset on Every SideWhen he came from the steps that dropped from Jason 's office to the yard , Nan Hunt called to him from somewhere within the house . It was a testament to the absolute charm of her voice that she could win his attention at that moment . " I know you 're busy , but can you come here just a minute ? " He skirted the corner of the house with its rich slumberous shrubbery , and hastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood near the turn of the porch , back of the green glider . " We want you for dinner tomorrow night after the speaking , " she told him . " Perhaps Cissy mentioned it . " " No  --  oh , yes , yes she did , I think . Excuse me , Miss Nan . The heat and politics together are too much for me . " He came toward her , threading amongst the rocking chairs , but she stepped back from him saying , " Kerney , " and he had to turn the farthest corner of the porch , puzzling , to find her again . She stood near the wall . The walnut just outside shadowed them ; the sun had not yet struck through : they were as sheltered and private as if.  |p199they  had suddenly entered a little grove . Her hand held his wrist , and her face so swiftly near him had transformed itself on the moment . He had never seen her like this before . She was touched back into youth as startlingly as though she had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her life ; she was more beautiful than both her daughters ; and she said , " Whatever he advised you , do n't do it . I do n't know what it could be . He does not discuss his business with me ; I have no notion . But if there is a murmur of your heart against him , then follow your heart . Oh , believe me , believe me , Kerney ! You will never be sorry ! " Kerney 's intellect was catlike ; thrown into a tailspin , it had a tendency to reappear on its feet . He thought at once : Was Jason Hunt this bad ? The hand on his sleeve , not small , more strong than weak , was still of an indescribable fragility , and the whole woman like a flower nurtured to that perfect bloom which , inexchangeablefor any other , is flawed only by its surroundings : it is a trifle too heavy for its stem , and what climate yields its proper airs ? Certainly Mississippi seasons were all too coarse for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indisputable discriminations ? Jason Hunt had failed , and Kerney knew that he would fail too . There remained to her the exquisite intimacies of pain , and what subtle memories one could not even guess at . Thus he rapidly reasoned himself apart from her , and though he replied with gallantry and affection that would have seemed genuine to almost anybody , he left her lonelier than before , for if she seldom risked a gesture of the heart , she had not forgotten how to recognize one . Her diamonds blinked but she did not ; she parted from him graciously . The irony of his reaction to her was that he had already made up his mind to reject Jason 's ideas before she suggested it . The scales had already tipped decisively ; his step had been certain as a saint 's . But her appearance in the matter had thrown Jason into unexpected light , and not so much Kerney 's decision , but the whole apparatus of it was shaken . For if Jason was wrong aboutp200Duncan , and Nan unjustified about Jason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which put Kerney Woolbright on shaky ground , and was not good . To add to his confusion , Cissy appeared on the path before him . " Silly , " she said . " You almost ran into me without looking . All time thinking about politics . Silly . " " Cissy , " he said , and put an arm around her . " Walk with me down the walk and listen to me a minute . " " Well , I 'll listening . What 's the matter ? " He could not begin . He had no way to explain . " Do n't say I told you , but I may not win the race . I may lose . " " Is somebody else running besides old Mr. Mavis ? " " No , honey , that 's not it . " " But who on earth would vote for old Mr. Mavis instead of you ? You 're just worrying over nothing . " He went a little way down the flight of wooden steps that led to the street , and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreseen her among young Washington matrons , photographed on the White House lawn . " You have n't even noticed my new dress . " She spread wide around her knees a chambray skirt of yellow , paneled in white cotton eyelet . " You do n't notice anything any more . We never get to go anywhere . You never tell me anything . " " Cissy , please do n't tell this to anybody , but I  --  " " You always say that ! You know I wo n't tell anything ! " But , alas , she told everything she knew to everybody she knew , and they both knew it . But he never challenged her when she insisted this way , and he did not now . " What were you going to tell me , Kerney ? " He shook his head . " I just do n't have time now , honey . I have to go uptown . " " I do n't like the way you 're doing me , Kerney . I meant to wait and tell you after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want anybody who 's going to be all the time leaving ane aboutp201important things they wo n't talk about . You never do explain anything to me . All I 'm supposed to do is talk baby talk to you . I do it when I do n't feel like it one bit . I think it 's the silliest thing I ever heard of . I get sick myself sometimes . I 'm not going to do it any more , either . I tell you that right now . " He got up and went slowly down the steps toward his car , which in his haste he had left in the road instead of ascending the drive . He entered the scalding sun and paused , turning back . There were tears in his eyes , but he judged she could not see them . She rose from the ankles , sturdily , without touching anything . " You 're treating me the way Daddy treats Mother . He never tells her anything . If your business is all that important , and you 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Either that , or I 'm going to quit liking you . You need n't think I ca n't , Kerney , not for a minute . " He went away without saying anything . He felt like a small boy , unjustly injured , and wanted to go home and be called soft names . It happened to Duncan , he thought . Now it 's happening to me.  |p205Willard  Follansbee , child of scorn , sat in one of Bud Grantham 's hide-bottom chairs with his straw hat in his lap . He looked about as delighted with the world as the world was with him , but his abiding consolation was that both he and the world knew it . " They do n't want me . I do n't kid myself none . They do n't even like me . When they voted for me before they 's voting for Travis , just on account of he could n't succeed himself . When they vote for me this go-round they 'll be voting against Harper . The thing I aim to make certain sure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote against Duncan Harper for . You know , Bud , I ca n't stand the sight of that fellow . " " I never thought he was such a bad type , " said Bud Grantham . " I never felt nothing unkindly towardjuh him . " He ran one tough old finger across three warts in the palm of his hand . He had been to the conjure woman a week ago , but so far they had n't shed . " Listen , " said Willard , " I get to where I ca n't stand the sight of the hat on his head or the shirt on his back . I ca n't decide when I do n't like him the most , when he comes in the door or when he goes out the door . I tried to decide it yesterday , but s'help me , I could n't . " " Folks like him in general , " said Bud , " or so I 'm told . " " Listen , " said Willard , " I been treading lightly over him when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that country folks do n't care nothing atall about football ? " " I knew , " said Bud , " that Bud Grantham do n't care nothing for it . I could n't care less . I do n't even care at the time , much less ten years later . I do n't even put a two-dollar bet in on the pool . " " You tell me honestly , Bud . How do we stand ? " " We stand to win , is my feeling . But you know my heart ain'tp206in it so much , Willard , what with Jimmy laid up and the place shut down . I got nothing to do all day but swat flies . " " Yeah , it 's bad , I know . How you figger we stand to win ? " " Because Harper ai n't caught the nigger yet . Everybody thinks the nigger shot Jimmy . I do n't think he 's going to catch that nigger . If you want to trample on him when you speak , that 's the ground you ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this county just crazy about Jimmy , and it do n't set well that a nigger can shoot him down and go scot-free . Tell the truth , it do n't set well with me . I 'd like to get my hands on the nigger my own self . " " God help him to stay lost , is the way I look at it . If I laid hands on him first , he 'd never get to Duncan Harper alive . I think he knows too much . I think that 's why he run . " " I think he done it , " said Bud . " If he done it , how come Jimmy wo n't say so ? " " On account of what his daddy done . Jimmy do n't find the way of resting easy over that . Do n't ask me how come . We all got our peculiarities . " " On the other hand , " said Willard , " looks like he could have made up something better than what he did . Jimmy 's been laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurses singlefootingup and down for him , talking way down weak : It was a strange white man . Somebody out hunting . Never laid eyes on him . ' I 've knowed him to make up better than that to pass the time during a slow hand of poker . " " If you think the nigger did n't do it , who do you think did ? You said Sam sent them boys back there to talk to Jimmy . He did n't say nothing atall about trying to kill him . " " It 's true , " said Willard . " But how come them to give up the idea of talking to him that quick . " " Well , you were there , and heard what they said . I 'd gone onup to the house . Run through it one more time for me , Willard . " " It was after you followed Bella back over to the house . Pilston and Sam and me set there in the office and did n't say muchp207except I think Pilston did remark once on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he was right . Then I heard a shot , but I did n't think nothing about it . I knew the kid they had with them carried a gun , but if I thought anything , I thought somebody was just pranking with it . " " I 'm all time hearing shots off in the woods , " said Bud . " It do n't signify no more to me than a axe ringing . You take just this morning . I heard two right close together off down towardjuh the creek . " " That day , " said Willard , " you never heard but one . But , like I say , I did n't think nothing . Was n't a minute later that Mitchell come to the door and called Sam out into the main part of the Idle Hour to tell him something . Sam came straight back , polite and cool as a preacher in the cool of Sunday morning before the singing and the sermon and the fried chicken , and says that they 've decided not to talk to Jimmy right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods arguing with some nigger . He says he and Wally were headed on back when they heard a shot from down there . ' Naturally , ' he says , ' we do n't care to be involved in any local matter . We prefer to drive along now , attend to some business over in the Delta , ' he says , ' and strike back here long about nine or ten o'clock . ' Mitchell had already gone and got in the back seat with the boy , and Sam and Pilston took the front , with Pilston driving . They said ' So long till later , ' and drove off West , toward the Delta . They never came back . " " They might have heard about Jimmy in time not to come back , " said Bud . " News being what it is when it comes to traveling . " " All I said to myself at the time was , ' Well , Jimmy 's finally decided to handle that Dozer nigger for double-crossing him . ' I did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to town . It was n't till I heard Jimmy was in the hospital that I seen the light . So that 's how come they left so quick , I says . They done it themselves . " " I think they caught the nigger at it , " Bud said . " I think , likep208they said , they never wanted to be mixed up in nothing of that type . If Pilston had gone into the woods , now  --  But what call for quarrel was there , Willard , between Jimmy and Mitchell ? " " The one toting the gun was that boy . " " If I remember right , him and Jimmy had just struck up akinship right after they come . "  --  " That would n't make no difference to folks like them . " " I think it was the nigger , " said Bud . They sat silently for a time in Bud 's room with the old iron bed , the washstand , and the desk pushed over against the wall . The ledgers were there , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the office at the Idle Hour and sometimestried to figure out where he ought to enter his expenses . " I think it was the nigger , too , " said Bella , walking in . " He do n't talk to you , either ? " Willard asked . " No more than to anybody else since he 's been up yonder in the hospital , but one time he told me a story about when he was overseas . He run into the Dozer nigger and the Dozer nigger tried to kill him . Did you know that , Daddy ? " " I do n't know nothing about overseas , " said Bud . " Jimmy 's funny about that nigger , " said Willard , " for a fact . You 'd think he 'd bought him and paid cash for him . He 's that attached . " " Where you going , honey baby ? " asked Bud . " All diked out . " She had got herself up in a cool sleeveless summer cotton with big Hawaiian flowers on it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was not such a bad-looking girl . " I 'm going to the meeting , Daddy , " she said . " I was hoping you could come go with me . " " I best stay with the chap , " said Bud . " Is he sleep ? " " Lucy 's coming to stay with him . You come on now , Daddy . I promised I 'd bring somebody . They had it all divided off last night . You could get in the Tomorrow I 'll Take Jesus As My Savior group , or you could choose the Tomorrow I 'll Speak to Someone about Jesus group , or you could be in the Tomorrowp209I 'll Bring Somebody Else to the Meeting group . So I picked that one . " " Ca n't you just speak to him about Jesus and go on ? " Willard asked . " No , because I promised this other one . It would n't be doing right , would it ? " " It 's a fact I ought to go , " said Bud . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own bench saved for us , me and her and all the chaps . They could n't open a meeting without us . My own mother went morning and night . I 've seen the time she 'd get up sick to go . I never seen a better woman . Not in all my borned days . You tell ' em up there , baby , that your old daddy 's a sinner , but his heart 's with ' em , and he aims to get there yet . " A voice called from out in the dark . " Miss Bella ? Oh , Miss Bella ? " " It 's Lucy , " said Bella . " Come on in , Lucy . " " That 's Beck 's wife , ai n't it ? " Willard asked , as the quiet , thin Negro girl entered from the back porch and halted just inside the screen door . She wore a dark , straight-cut cotton dress and lowquartertennis shoes . She had wrapped the hem of an old pillow slip around her head , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair grease and the hot-iron comb , just as if something special might be about to happen . She was at once aware from MisterWillard Follansbee 's glance that the white cone on her head looked attractive , but she did not remove it . " Come here , girl , " said Follansbee . Shy , tall , soft , she moved to the edge of the lamplight . " Come here ! " he repeated , pointing to a straight chair , and when she hesitated he seized her by the wrist and flung her into it . " Where 's Beck at ? " " I do n't know , sir . " " Look at me . " He jerked up her face . " I said I do n't know , sir . I ai n't seen him . " " You ai n't seen him , " Willard mimicked . " It 's going on three weeks . What 's he doing  --  or is he doing without ? "  |p210Lucy  turned her head aside . She was conscious of the white man 's slack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punctures and the breath moved in and out . She went dull all over , animal , African , obedient to the forcing whip . " I ai n't seen him , " she repeated . " ' I ai n't seen him , ' " Willard mocked . " Listen , nigger , you know the worse thing a white man can do to a black man , do n't you ? " " I do n't know , sir . " " You do n't ? You never heard what happens to a black man if he tries anything with a white woman ? " " Beck ai n't done nothing . There was n't no white lady . " " You tell Beck to stay gone from here . ' Cause if I see him itai n't going to make no difference if there was a white lady orthere was n't a white lady . It 's going to be the same for WillardFollansbee . Willard Follansbee . That 's me . You understand ? " " Yes , sir . " " What you going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " " Tell him what ? " " To stay way from here . " " Stay way how come ? " " ' Count of what you 'd do . " " What would I do ? You tell me . " He bent suddenly close to her . " You tell me . " " Willard , " said Bud Grantham and put a stubby old hand between them , shoving the man back from her , " you done said enough , considering there 's a lady present . " " Oh , " said Willard , recovering , " damn if I did n't forget . " He glanced to where Bella stood just out of the light , leaning forward in close scrutiny of Lucy 's face . Willard ran his fingers through his long thin straight black hair , pulling it away from his wet brow . He turned his back on Bella and walked uncertainly toward the dark back screen door . " Oo , " said Bella , straightening up with something like ap211shudder , or maybe a rabbit running across her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and she added , though whether to make her feelings plausible to the men or to herself was not clear , " If you bother her , she wo n't look after the baby good , and it 's time I was at church . "  --  " Run on along , baby , " said Bud Grantham . " It 's all agoing to be all right . " " Can I tell ' em you 'll come next time , Daddy ? " " You tell ' em that . " Lucy rose and moved toward the door of the room where Bella was staying . " his bottle 's in the icebox , Lucy , " Bella called back . " Do n't forget to heat it . " Beck never let Lucy work in white folks ' houses . He made good enough money when he was foreman at the tie plant , before all these things started happening . Now when they sent for her she was scared to go and scared not to go . She hardly knew day from night any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being able to say what she was doing . After she had fed the little baby and joggled him and changed him , she knew beyond a doubt what the white man was waiting there for . He was walking around in Mister Bud 's room by himself , drinking Mister Bud 's whisky . Mister Bud himself was out on the back porch in the dark , rocking and singing along with the white-folks tent meeting down the road . " There is a fountain filled with blood Drawn from Immanuel 's veins , And sinners plunged beneath that flood ... " She accepted what would happen . A Negro , lowered past a certain line of misfortune , no longer counts on cleverness : shep212did not think how she could divert him , contrive to upset the baby , win the other man 's attention . Some savage instinct made her scrounge down low in the corner between the window and the bed . She took off her white headwrap and laid it on the counterpane . " The dying thief rejoiced to see That fountain in his day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " Out on the back porch , Mister Bud was belling like a hound . The room was dark . When the door opened , and light entered , she turned her head low . If he did n't quit breathing so loud , he would wake up the baby . She recalled the time she used to go down to the Sanders ' house , the white-folks kitchen where Aunt Mattie used to cook . On the sidewalk one day by the hill up Mister Sanders ' pasture , that old white man stopped her . It was spring and the iris blades felt cold on her legs . Aunt Mattie had raised her nice : she did n't know what he meant . She could n't have been more than nine or ten . When she came crying into the kitchen , Aunt Mattie looked her over good , then gave her some coffee . The white lady , Miss Jessie Sanders , took on worse than Mattie . " That awful old man . He ought to be ashamed ! I 'd like to let him know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm , " said Mattie , " nex ' time she know to run ' fo ' he see her , stid of after . " But Miss Jessie still took on . She took on and took on . She told her husband at the dinner table . " That awful old thing , " she said . " To hear him pray out loud in church ! You think he 'd died and gone to heaven . " " Did he hurt her , Mattie ? " Mister David called back to the kitchen . " Naw suh , " said Mattie , taking her own sweet time . " I reckon he too old . " " Nasty thing , " said Miss Jessie .... ' When Lucy walked back through the woods , tears lay along her cheeks like scars . The days for running to Aunt Mattie were gone long ago . She could n't even tell Beck what the white man had done . He would feel it worse than she did . He might even dop213something crazy . Right after she first married Beck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept shining around . He wanted to come sit on the porch on Sunday and talk . Beck would n't have it . Little as Beck was , he said he would kill that nigger if he kept on coming by . That was how she knew about Beck . " He sound asleep , Mister Bud , " she had said . " My own chillen ai n't had they supper . " " You can go , " said Bud Grantham . " Bella 'll be home now in a minute . I hear they 're singing the invitation hymn . " They sure enough were . " Just as I am , without one plea , But that thy blood was shed for me And that thou bid'st me come to thee 0 Lamb of God , I come ! I come ! " Brother Simmons at the Bear Ma'sh M.E. Church used that one too , but Lucy felt too ill-used to take satisfaction from it . She followed a twisting , wooded path that led her beyond the field where Mister Jimmy Tallant had got shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stile . She passed a spring , set back deep in a hollow where the water winked and shifted like an eye , and there gushed out into the night air the deep earth smell of black loam . The night was thick with life : it sang or buzzed or chanted or chirped or jumped off into the bog or ran through the leaves , and a lot of it probably had no , business out on this side of the grave . Lucy had never bothered much about h'ants . Not that she doubted them . Black people are night people , and you do not drive a Southern road at any unearthly hour without seeing them along the roadsides , going somewhere , or marking at a distance across the field the oil lamp burning full wick within the cabin . Sometimes , passing near a cabin that is totally dark as though for sleep , one hears break out again the low mingling of many voices ; no crisis has brought them there , but the instinctive motion of their strange society has behaved like a current deepp214down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they came to a savage land , and it took them in . White people , already appalled by floods and rattlesnakes , malaria , swamps , tornadoes , mud , ice , sunstroke , and typhoid fever , felt compelled to levee out the black with the same ruthless patience with which they leveed the Mississippi River . They were driven to do what they did , not by any conviction of right or wrong , but by the simple will to survive . Meanwhile , Negroes married the land . Its image is never complete without them ; if they are out of the picture , they are only just around the corner , coming or going , or both . They are not really as afraid in the night as most white people are . Whiteness is a kind of nakedness to the dark world , and Lucy , who had all the fear she could do with , went to no trouble to imagine more . She moved on in her blackness , and her heart , sick and numb , burned tender as the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who ? " she asked plain out when the figure appeared ahead of her , silhouetted down a little free length of path . " It 's me , Aunt Lucy . " It was W.B. " You ai n't heard nothing ? " she asked when they came together . " Nothing from Unker Beck . Mister Duncan is at the house , though . " " Doing what ? " " He in setting by Granny . Claim she nussed his papa when his papa died , and laid him straight and all . Claim she cared for his mama after his mama birthed him . He done tole me all about it once befo ' . " " What he coming for now ? It ai n't no interest of mine who nussed his daddy and eased his mammy . If Granny done it , look at Granny . Who 's caring for her now ? " " We is , Aunt Lucy . " " V.Te sho ' is . Do n't you tell that white man nothing , W.B. Ai n't nobody to help Beck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . " " Ack like you dumb , ack like you crazy , but do n't say nothingp215to a white man . Wall yo ' eyes like you ai n't got good sense . You hear me , W.B. ? " " Yes 'm , Aunt Lucy . I hears you . " " Beck call hisself being so smart . Going to make first this deal with the white , then the next one better still . There ai n't no dealing with white folks , this one or the next one . I reckon Beck know hit now . Turn aloose of me and hush , W.B. I ai n't got time for you to be no baby . You gots to be a man . " " Aunt Lucy , Unker Beck never done it . Unker Beck never shot Mister Jimmy Tallant . " " No , he never , W.B. But when the white folks think you done something , you just well 's to run . " " I run the day Mister Travis Brevard died . " " Then you knows about your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He must have his own chance to decide , " said Duncan , speaking very slowly . " He must have his own choice . If Mister Willard Follansbee wins the election , he and Mister Bud Grantham will kill Beck if they can find him . You 'll have to leave here , leave your house and home to go to him . The reason people say they ' do n't want to vote for me is because I let Beck get away . If Beck will come back , I will protect him . You know I 'll protect him because I did it once before , up at the jail . " " I do n't know where he at , " said Lucy . " Me neither , " said W.B. " Yo ' daddy had the prettiest ca'edge hoss I most ever seen , " said Aunt Mattie . " The day you 's born it come up a little whipping storm and Mister Henry Harper hitched his buggy up at the top of the heel and come walking for me . How come us walking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' I gots to spoht myp216equipage uptown tomorrow , Mattie , and you ai n't gwy catch me splashing it up on no nigger road . ' But Lawd , in dem days the roads in town was apt to slush up bad as any . " " We know now that Beck did not shoot Mister Tallant . We have a good start on finding the people who did . We may find them any minute now . The last I heard , the police had located them , down in New Orleans ; it 's just a matter of getting them to confess . If Beck will trust me and come give himself up , then everybody will know he was n't mixed up in anything . Nobody can say he was . " " Mister Jimmy Tallant ai n't going to let them do nothing to Beck . " " Mister Jimmy Tallant has had two weeks to call the name of the man that shot him , and he has n't called it yet . It would bust his business if folks knew that New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have n't got to do anything that will cause you trouble , anything to put you in danger . You just have got to get word to Beck exactly what I say and let him decide . " " I do n't know where he at , " said Lucy . " Me neither , " said W.B. , who was watching the white man he used to work for . In spite of everything he was pleased to death that Mister Duncan had come to their house . " W.B. could go , " said Duncan . " I know W.B. well because he 's worked for me . Folks said , That boy is too little to know where to take groceries , but I did n't think so . I said , He 's a good . boy and a smart boy . He 'll learn . I was right . Was n't I , W.B. ? " Lucy saw the child grin from ear to ear , and his absence of fear scared her . " Git yonder in the kitchen and see what is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He skipped past Granny to obey . All evening , with the sound of children in the house , Aunt Mattie felt she was in heaven . She had just gone in and lookedp217at Miss Edna Harper 's new baby ; he was grown and in the room here now  --  she did not mistake who was there , though all her eyes could see was the kerosene lamp flame they lighted for her every time it got dark . Mister Henry Harper had just brought her to the door , he had let her in the front , the way she always came in to her white folks , and she 'd gone straight on back to where Miss Edna was moaning . In heaven you talked to whoever came to mind or into the room , it was the same , and did anybody know for sure this was n't it right now ? " Hit was the prettiest baby , " said Aunt Mattie , " the whitest white chile I done ever seen . " Lucy flashed Duncan a look of scorn . Her walls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , addled eyes and her cap of hair short and kinky as a man 's ( for all her hundred and who knew how many years , it was gray , not white , and never would lose its tenacity to color )  --  the old woman sat under a dark old quilt and even her fingernails were the rich deep amber color of old tree bark , and the andirons in the swept fireplace were black as old muffin pans . What'was white ? " Beck got to do what he do in he own time , " she said . " That 's exactly right , " said Duncan . " But he ca n't do anything unless you tell him how things stand . " " In dem days , " said Aunt Mattie , " ever'thing Miss Edna Harper say do Mister Henry Harper done . But she could n't do nothing atall with old Mister Phillip , po ' lady .

You tend to your'n and I 'll tend to mine . ' flee ! Hee ! He never seed me afterwards he did n't mention it . Did you get her churched , Mattie ? ' Hee ! Hee ! "  | " How I know where Beck at ? " said Lucy . " Maybe he in New Orleans , maybe he in Memphis . I do n't know . What I got to do with where he at ? " " You know , " said Duncan . W.B. came back . This time he stopped by Granny 's chair . Her hand touched his arm , groping up and down his sleeve . " He 's Granny 's man he is . Ai n't nothing gwy harm him . Nare a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus ' lamb . " Duncan picked up the kerosene lamp from the table and crossed to where the large daguerrotype of Beck Dozer 's father hung on the wall . The face in the daguerrotype was thin and severe and the hair the true woolly African neatness of fit , the texture of a good rug . The head was held rigidly high , but neither , it would appear , through consciousness at having a picture made , nor from the restraint of the high boiled collar . The eyes seemed concerned . This man , or so the story went , had given up his job as butler in the fashionable Standsbury house and had moved with his family to the country outside Lacey where he owned a little legacy of land . There was a good-sized Negro-tenant and freefarmerpopulation in that area : Robinson Dozer founded a little school in his own front yard . His parents had been slaves of a senator , John Lucian Upinshaw , " Senator John . " The old man , living poorly after the war in a splendid house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his former slaves . Robinson Dozer had sat on a bench with the other Negro children out in the guesthouse in the front yard  --  the one the Senator had converted into a library . Robinson 's eyes were big as a raccoon 's ; his mouth hung openp219long enough for a jenny wren to nest in it ; and he remembered every word that Senator John said . Senator John thought that Southerners should have started this sort of thing years ago ; he felt compassion for these black innocents so violently kicked into freedom ; he thought that only the educated mind was fit for American citizenship . His mind burned clearly . He thanked God for this calling here in his old age , his poverty , the ruin of his country . One frosty morning an hour before his class , he fell on the back steps and broke his hip . He sent his niece to tell the Negro children , but what with all the excitement of the fetching and carrying , she forgot to go . The black children sat on the benches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then , as though someone had signaled , they bolted . They ran in terror across the lawn , dropping the tablets and pencils along the garden path . Propped high in a mahogany four-poster , his stout old leg intricately distended toward the ceiling by a homemade pully , the Senator announced he would continue his classes in his bedroom . Next morning , he sent his grandson down to the guesthouse to bring the students in . When ht last the boy came shivering back across the frozen yard and said that nobody had come , he became nervous and extremely irritated . He guessed the truth , that nobody had got to them the day before ; he commanded that everyone in the house be marshaled to go out and search for them all over the plantation , to bring in every one of them if it took till sundown . After a while , his daughter came into his room . She had a paper full of cornfield peas and she shelled them with jerking motions while she talked , casting hulls by the handful into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was running the house now . Her husband had been killed at Shiloh . She used to cry at night and play songs on the piano at twilight , but now she did not have time for either one . Her bare arms were broken out in red spots where she had been out in the garden gathering the peas and turnip greens  --  that was all they had to eat now : firstp220peas , then turnip greens and turnips , cooked with a bit of salt pork . She did not notice any longer that it was cold : a fire in a room was apt to make her say she was burning up , whereupon she would stamp out , as though mad at somebody . A Union officer and ten strange Negroes had raided the smokehouse three days before and left them with no meat at all . She had penned two shoats right at the back door , and said she would raise them if she had to move them into her bedroom . " Papa , " she said , jerking the hulls away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't have the children going out of sight of the house . It 's dangerous on the roads now . I have to take Holcomb and the shotgun with me when I go to town in the buggy . If those little niggers appreciated what you 're doing they 'd come back . The answer is they do n't appreciate it . You 're not teaching them anything , " she went on pitilessly ; " you 're wasting your time and your strength , out there in that cold office . I do n't know that I want them in here anyway , smelling up my house . Every child on this place is working ; why ca n't they ? " " Working ! Why , Liza , child , what do you call work ? I 've raised a sweat on the little rascals out there in the cold ; you would n't believe how much they 've learned . They know the alphabet , and how to cipher , the names of some few states , and can print a sentence or two on paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he set his slaves free . Think of it , Liza ! In a scant fifty years from savagery ! " " Savagery ! They 're animals , if you ask me . They are n't as good as savages . There 's Nanny and old Luke and who else ? Nobody . They come to the back door wanting something to eat . Go to the Yankees ' : that 's what I ought to say . But I do n't . All right , ' I say , I planted that garden with these two hands , and I sweated down to nothing hoeing it , and when nobody else is around , who goes out and gets the vegetables ? Me . But all right . Go cut me some kindling wood , go straighten up the back fence where that crazy cow got her yoke caught , go in the woods and get me a new hoe handle . Then you can come and eat same as we do , turnip greensp221and side meat , corn bread and potlikker , and if that ai n't good enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get . ' That 's what I say . " " You poor child . Having to do all this work . I 'm sorry , Liza . " " It is n't only work , Papa . It 's danger , night and day . You never know what 's going to happen next . They can start burning houses again ; they can turn us into slaves ; they 're crazy , I tell you ; they can do anything . " " Liza , do n't get upset . " " Upset ! " This was too much . She told him everything , tearing the hulls viciously apart , things that were happening in town , along the roads , at the capital , all over the South . " Why was n't I told ? " he asked sternly . " I did n't want to worry you . You could n't do anything about it . He knew then that he was old . Easing the leather-bound volume aside , taking off his spectacles , he agreed , " No , I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching little niggers . " Not only old , childish . He had to be humored . He sighed . What had gone with his daughter 's gentle tongue ? He was not used to being wounded by women . " Poor Liza . Poor little girl . " They heard Aunt Nanny scolding in the hall . " You say you wants to see him , well , go ahead on in and see him . I ai n't got time to waste on trash like you is . " In the high white doorway , there appeared the Negro boy with the raccoon eyes in the small face . " Why , " said Senator John , " it 's Robinson Dozer . He 's come for his lesson . Get on out into the kitchen with your pea-shelling , Liza . I 'm lying here worthless , but I can teach this boy . " The old man never walked again . He went about in a wheel chair for years till he died , and it was Robinson Dozer who pushed him everywhere , reciting Presidents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking to the chant of " Washington , Adams , Jefferson , John Quincy Adams , Madison , Monroe .... "  |p222They  did this when they got him by himself . They did n't dare mock him in front of Senator John . He eventually moved into the house with the old man , slept in the trundle bed , and padded in and out with slop jars , water for shaving , trays of food , and books , books , books . The family said that all he could learn was the Presidents ' names , just as they said that this was all the old Senator had memory enough left to teach him . But one day at the dinner table one of the cousins said he had heard them wheeling around in the back yard together speaking French . " French ! " There was a silence . " Or maybe it was Latin , " said the cousin . " Well , I hope so , " said Eliza . " Teaching that black thing French . The idea ! " " Granddaddy do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Davy , a great sarcastic boy . " Naw , he do n't know French . " " I did n't think he remembered Latin either , " said Eliza . " Maybe he do n't , " said Davy . " I do n't see how Vernon would know . Maybe Robinson was teaching African to Granddaddy . " " It was n't English , " said Vernon . " Holler see 's there any more bread . " When Senator John realized he was perhaps engaged in a dangerous thing , it was too late to stop . An intellectual thirst is impossible to sate . Waking in the first dawn , the old man would lie regarding with the tenderness of a parent , the frail boyish form outlined under the covers of the flat bed near the hearth . " What will happen to him ? " he thought . " What have I done to him ? " In his will he left a little farm to Robinson Dozer , from his holdings in the county . Also that part of his library which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have gone North . Eliza told him as much , the day after the funeral . " I 'll always be as good to you as I can because of Papa . But there 's not going to be anybody else like him , not down here . As I said when Xavier got killed in the war , This is another life I 've got to start , another person I 've got to be . You can stay here as long as you want to  --  "  | " I 've packed already , Miss Eliza . With your permission , IT be leaving this afternoon . " " Oh . " She gave him a hard look but she did not inquire into his business . " If I were you , I 'd sell the land Papa left you and find some place up North . I 'll write a note to Judge Standsbury . Maybe for Papa 's sake he 'll write letters to that college in the East . Do you want me to do that ? " He had been laughed at in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ask for anything . " Whatever you would like to do , Miss Eliza . " She turned abruptly to her desk , pulling paper forward from the pigeonholes , drawing out blotter , inkstand , and pen . " If it were n't for Papa  --  " The letters came out blackly aslant , but the words , as always in letters or conversations " outside the family , " were courteous and warm . Judge Standsbury , seated in his law office near the fire , said " Ummm " three times to the letter . He had no idea what to do with Robinson Dozer . His air of benevolent learning imparted the impression that he knew everything practical as a matter of course . When he took off his glasses and pressed his brows between two fingers he seemed to be weighing a number of dive , rse possibilities . Actually he was provoked at this whim of old John 's , educating a colored boy , and the way John had reached out and snagged him from the other side of the grave . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North , Robinson ? " " I should first like to acquire a college degree , sir , then possiblysecure a position as a teacher . I might even look into the law . " " Ummm , " said Judge Standsbury . In the grate a lump of soft coal burst from within and two parts of it tumbled out on the floor . Judge Standsbury watched Robinson 's appreciative handling of the fire tongs and shovel , as if the feel of the wrought iron pleased him . As indeed it did . Along with a taste for Latin prose , Robinson had acquired a tendency to feel at home under hand-carved moldings.  | " " These affairs will take a little time , Robinson , a little time . " " I recognize that , Judge Standsbury . " " You mean to go back out to Miss Eliza 's ? " " Miss Eliza and I do not have too successful an understanding . " " Then I think you 'd better come down to stay at our place , Robinson , while we 're waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the ten years that Robinson was the Standsbury butler , the matter of his going North was never mentioned again . Judge Standsbury sometimes woke in the night and thought with a twinge in the direction of the old Senator 's grave that he had never written letters for Robinson . But Robinson had never mentioned the matter again . Well , he was a whole lot better off down here and probably knew it . Had n't they taken him in ? Easy , easy now , Judge Standsbury slid back into sleep . The truth was , Robinson could never bring himself to ask for anything . In summer he wore a white coat ; in winter a black one with a white boiled shirt , starched collar , and black string tie . If he was superior to all the Negroes , he was no less superior to all the whites , for the Standsbury household was a sociable onenot much given to books . Robinson lived gravely among silver , polished woods , and heavy glass decanters . In his room off the kitchen he read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Standsbury children dared enter his quarters . He was the terror of their youth . The first anybody knew that Robinson had a wife and two children was the day he left the Standsburys for good . He led his family into the parlor where everyone was assembled just followingSunday dinner , and introduced them all around . He was already packed , he said , and would be leaving within the hour . Then he led the way from the room . " So that 's how Robinson spent his Sundays , " said Judge Standsbury after the entire family had passed ten minutes in silence , something of a record . He had not dared say this in front of Robinson . P225Ever after the Standsburys remembered him and talked about him , for living with Robinson in the house was a memorable thing . A glance from him was worse than a beating from their parents . The parents , too , had felt supervised , and had been known to leave the house to quarrel so that Robinson would not overhear them . His opinions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he thought . When guests came , Robinson gave the Standsburys great prestige . In fact , his service with them solidified them in the opinion that they were aristocrats ; before , they had often suspected that they were not . Yet they were never really comfortable with him , and his departure liberated their spirits so much that things looked rather perilous for a week or so . Judge Standsbury came to the table once in his shirtsleeves , and the children were discovered romping barefoot in the best parlor . But nobody said they wanted him back because neither they nor anybody else ever really liked Robinson . The old Senator had loved him , and this love had emancipated him , had made him independent , learned , scornful , superior , and unkind . When he left he went back to the piece of land the Senator had willed him , which had been what Judge Standsbury was asked to sell for him to finance his way up North . Here he took possession from the former tenant and began to farm . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overalls , blue-black at first and heavy as sailcloth , bending harshly to his thin limbs ' motion , but finally a blue as delicate as spring sky reflected in an old window , and as gently textured as silk . Word drifted back to town that Robinson had started a school for Negroes . Soon now , he was seen in town on Saturdays , not in overalls , but in the old black suit and string tie . He had long been a story , now he was a " character . " Negroes , who had never liked the " high-white " Standsbury butler , accepted him , and even white people treated him with respect , called him ' Fessor without joking , and sometimes gave him a small donation . It was believed that you could not really teach Negroes anything ; it wasp226reported that Robinson could not get them to attend classes any more than the town schoolmaster could , but even when Vardaman stumped the state with the message that " every nigger you educate is another nigger you have to kill , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bad thing until the First World War was over and the boys came home . Three of the boys were big black bucks from Robinson 's part of the county . They had learned a thing or two in France , they felt , and they called on Robinson to tell him about it . Later , they started taking lessons from Robinson at night . One of them had contrived to lose an arm in France : he got a disability check from the government , and the other two borrowed from him unmercifully , so they did not have to go to work . They were often remarked uptown on the square and not only on Saturday . There was something sinister about them : their togetherness , their size , their not working , their swagger , their watchfulness . It was hoped that Robinson was not putting any ideas in their heads . " Or vice versa , " a man like Acey Tallant might say , flipping his cigarette into the open grate in the chancery clerk 's office . He " traveled " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connections , and was wont to check by the courthouse on weekends to see what was going on . The three Negro veterans wore their uniforms , woolen shirts and khaki peg-top pants with wrap leggings that tapered to their wide army shoes . There was talk that Negroes would try to push for the vote since the war ended , that veterans would organize to this end ; some said that Negroes had volunteered in order to get to France and sleep with white women ; now that they were back , people said , they were crazy for more of the same . An automobile dealer ordered them out of his showroom because they had got in the habit of coming in and loitering all afternoon around the stove . Henry Harper said they always came into his grocery store after dark along about closing time and would not say what they wanted for an unaccountable long time . His uncle , old Phillip Harper , chased them out one night with his walking stick . Theyp227seemed determined to make people nervous . White people had been glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now they were tired of it ; the same story four times over would not work any more ; Negroes , if worthless , were at least supposed to be charming or funny . Robinson Dozer , as a matter of fact , had got tired of them too . He was still trying to make them stop talking about France so they could learn something , when the troubles started . In quick succession a white farmer 's cotton house was burned down , another had his pigs let out , a third was driving to town when the wheels of his buggy came off . White householders began to feel uncomfortably far from town , indeed from one another , and count themselves greatly outnumbered by the Negro farmers and renters . Unfortunately , at this time a white farmer 's daughter drowned in Pettico-cow . It had been a season of dry weather and she was found in the shallows of the deep hole where she had died . Or perhaps she had not died in the water , but had been thrown in afterward . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were said to have been signs of violence on her elsewhere , but since the family would on no account allow her to be examined , all descriptions of them conflicted . The path that led from Robinson Dozer 's house to the country road ran along the creek bank for a time  --  it ran , in fact , quite near the deep hole . The father of the girl at first , in his grief , got out his gun to go and kill the three Negro veterans . His neighbors restrained him . Negroes outnumbered them three to one , but relations had always been peaceful , even pleasant . The families of the boys were " good Negroes . " There were surely better ways to handle this . After the funeral , the white men met and talked far into the night ; the next day a sober wagonload drove into town , calm in the sense of having reached just decisions without resort to violence . They had two demands to make : first that the three veterans be arrested immediately on suspicion of murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they be made to leave the county for good ; second , that Robinson Dozer 's school be closed . " You see what happens , " they said , " when you try to educate a nigger . " The three Negro veterans said that the first they heard of the girl 's death was when they were arrested on the town square . Following the arrival of the latest disability check they had spent several days pleasuring themselves over in the Delta at a Negro settlement known as Coontown . Several hundred Negroes there must have seen them and remembered them , but though they sent urgent messages not one appeared to say so . The sheriff locked them up in the jail , the farming delegation turned homewardin the creaking wagon , the town passed uneasy nights . Robinson Dozer was exercised ; he made several patient trips between town and his home . He called on the sheriff , talked with the veterans , was closeted with Judge Standsbury for an hour . Secretly he did not so much care what happened to the boys ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gained permission , at last , to assemble a black delegation : the parents of the boys ( it then emerged that two of them were brothers ) , two leading Negro freeholders , and himself . The white delegation promised to return , and Judge Standsbury himself agreed to preside . Though tired , Robinson supped in the evening with dignity , spoke little with his family , and composed himself early for bed . The time had been set for two-thirty ; the place was the courthouse . Robinson Dozer with his delegation arrived at the courthouse an hour before the appointed time . He arranged this purposely . He did not want anybody saying that the niggers did n't care . The white delegation had been in town since morning . They scarcely ever saw town except on Saturdays , so they made a picnic of it , ate a box lunch , bought one thing and another , and jawed a good bit in the stores . In the drugstore they saw Acey Tallant  --  he had just come back to Lacey from a trip out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but his only comment was that " things had certainlygotten out of hand . " He was seen later in the newspaperp229office , and again in the cafe , whence he crossed decisively to the pool hall . Up at the courthouse , the sheriff sent the Negro deputation upstairs to the large courtroom to wait . He sent a man with a shotgun to stand at the door . He had the windows open for the first time that spring , and the flies were about to run him crazy . Around two o'clock he sent two armed deputies to the jail for the three veterans . A tubby , jolly , rather simple-minded man , his theory was that Negroes should be kept intimidated by a big show of handcuffing and guns . " You can do anything with ' em , " he said , " as long as you keep the hell scared out of ' em . " Playing solitaire at his desk , he heard the step of the three prisoners and the two white men resound in the big halls and pass up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good dinner , and settled for a little nap before going up to the courthouse . Several times the phrase , " Friend of black and white alike , " occurredto him , for he had gained the age where what they could not escape saying in the newspapers when he died wandered pleasantly through his mind . He felt gratified that Robinson had had at last to call on him about something . Robinson had made all of the Standsburys feel uncomfortably that things would someday be the other way around . The judge napped with the Memphis paper on his chest and his feet covered by an afghan . At twofifteenhe rose , put on his coat , buttoned his vest , adjusted the heavy gold chain which caught the sun so skillfully , selected his handsomest silver-mounted walking cane and , wishing to be not more than a few minutes late , started briskly toward town . The chubby sheriff , hearing the trample of a dozen men in the hall , came out of his office to see what was going on . The men were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal connection with the matter in hand . They looked pleasant enough , however ; the only noticeably sinister thing about them was that they were all of about the same appearance  --  tall , active , with weathered faces , neither young nor old  --  you might have thoughtp230that somebody had chosen them . The sheriff knew them all , and that they were part of his constituency . " Where you boys going ? " he asked . " Just upstairs . Just to see what 's going on . " The man who had answered was Acey Tallant . Everyone had expected him to be the spokesman . He looked like the others , only more so  --  he was always in some slight way different from any group he was discovered among . And he was discovered among them all . He hunted with men richer than himself who liked him well enough but said he would never amount to very much . He was not originally from Winfield County , but had married into a good family there . He talked about property in neighboring counties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , managed some real estate for his wife , and was known to hold some sort of intermittentjob with a state office in Jackson . If you asked what it was he would tell you , but five minutes later it would seem you were no clearer on it than before . He was attractive to women . Always , when he talked to anyone he managed to make it seem that he was wasting valuable time , and for this subtlety to make its perfect stamp required a man like the chubby sheriff , holding an uncertain grip on a small job , hoping he was popular with everybody . " Y'all not toting guns or anything ? " " Of course we ai n't . " " I do n't want any trouble , you know . " " Trouble ? Who said anything about trouble ? We 're just curious . " " Okay then . If you promise . " " Sure we promise . " The chancery clerk around the corner blew his nose on a large white handkerchief , went back into his office and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home , " he said to his secretary . " In fact , I think we both better go home . " Upstairs , in the courtroom , the windows were open on the warm February day . Somebody had had the forethought to buildp231a fire in the stove that morning , but now in the steady early afternoonwarmth , the heat was superfluous and formed a visible sleepy glaze on the air . Robinson Dozer had selected , with a teacher 's instinct , a chair at the end of the table where the court clerk sat when court was in session . He now wore round gold-rimmed glasses before his round ' coon-dark eyes ; he kept his hands folded on the table before him and his face showed nothing . The three Negro veterans , from the habit of standing around stoves to talk about what they had seen in France , were standing by the stove now , albeit they were running sweat down the collars of their khaki woolens . They had got sluggish in the heat and their mouths hung slightly open . Their three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four older Negroes , their parents , had taken a bench together and were sitting now facing the empty judge 's stand as though they had come early for church . The two freeholders sat on the front row near the table . The men wore their best suits , with ties . The women wore silk dresses and hats ; one took snuff and another fanned herself . Over in the far corner of the large room , another Negro couple were sitting . They had come to see Judge Standsbury about getting a divorce , had been mistaken for part of Robinson 's group , and had been sent upstairs by the sheriff . Now they wished to leave , but when they went to the door to explain , one of the deputies ordered them back . Awkward , obedient , ignorant , hoping only to please , they did not attempt to say more , but repeated , " Yes suh , yes suh , " and drew away . They would not say anything now until somebody asked them something . Frightened , sitting close together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a divorce after all . ' When the crowd of strange white men appeared in the center aisle of the courtroom , Robinson Dozer did not at first turn his head . " It looks like the niggers done taken over , " said Acey Tallant . Robinson seemed to be looking them over , but the light glazed on his lenses and no one could tell but what he was contemptuous . " We are expecting Judge Standsbury , " he said.  | " When you talk to me , nigger , you better say Mister : " " I do n't know your name , sir . " " Then I 'll tell you something funny . You ai n't ever going to know my name . My name do n't matter . I 'm white and you 're black , that 's all that you and me need to know . " The delegation of farmers , seeing that Judge Standsbury was approaching the courthouse doors from the opposite side , gathered away from where the wagon was hitched by the iron fence and started together across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firing started and had to break apart and scatter when one of the Negro veterans , jumping from the upstairs window , nearly fell on top of them . It was the one-armed one who , ever since he had had his narrow escape in France , was apt to panic at the approach of danger . He had simply run out of the open window as though he would run on the air , and was still running with his legs and the one arm pumping perfectly together , when the white men saw him and scattered . It was thought the fall killed him , but the men were warned to stand aside while someone fired into his body from above . Judge Standsbury was just entering the courthouse door when the shots began echoing and resounding . Plaster fell around him as he ran upstairs , but they would not let him in . He wept openly and called for Robinson and at last was carried home , completely broken up . The family reassured him until he died that nothing that had happened was his fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice . Yet it seemed to him that to the extent he would not let what had happened in the courthouse stop him in his work , the work was vitiated , and to the extent that he would let it stop him , not only the work but he himself ceased to exist . " He 'll never be any good any more , " the family said to one another . " Nothing named Tallant is ever coming in this house again . " Yet one of his granddaughter 's best friends was Acey Tallant 's son . " Would n't he just die ? " they said to one another , but by then he was dead already.  |p233Beckwith  , Robinson 's youngest son , could still remember that they waited past sundown that night for his father to come home , that nobody ate anything all day , that when he giggled once his mother slapped his face , and that no lamp was lighted . Then the car came jouncing , rattling down the dry-rutted country road , and in its yellow approach the shadows walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound , and walked on . Then it was dark again . His sister clutched him by the shoulders and he held on to her knee . Finally his mother , who seemed to have it all in her head exactly when to do things , went out into the yard with his brother and together they carried in his father 's body . They washed him and dressed him in his other black suit , the old one , put on a clean boiled shirt and starched collar with the black string tie , and laid him out in bed . He lay straight and frail under the covers , and his head on the pillows was small as a child 's . You would have thought he had died right there , decently . That was what everything they were doing seemed to be trying to pretend . But his mother said , in front of them all , though talking to Beck , who was the littlest : " It 's this they taken him up for , so 's they could cast him down . Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , and do n't ever say nothing else . What face you got , keep for the black . Yo ' daddy never learned it . You see what done happened to him . " 41 41 An Impulse RestrainedDuncan Harper lowered the lamp from Robinson Dozer 's picture , and turned to Lucy . They each in their own way knew the whole story , but whether they had been told it or not or by whom would never be clear . Southerners hear parts of stories with their ears , and the rest they know with their hearts.  | " If Beck will come to me , " said Duncan , " I swear to do everything for his own good . " Aunt Mattie 's rocker creaked . " I says to Mister Henry Harper many 's the time , Mister Henry , how come you is such a gemman and yo ' uncle so triflin ' a man ? ' Said it right in front of Mister Phillip . But Mister Phillip he jes ' giggle . I 'll have you churched , Mattie , don ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " " I do n't know where he 's at , " said Lucy . For an instant Duncan 's eyes met W.B. 's . Then he set the lamp on the table and took his hat . " Dey always tell it on Mattie , When Mattie got any sass to say , Mattie sass you to the face . But Mattie loves her white folks . What dey gwy do ' thout Mattie ? Who gwy love ' em like Mattie do ? " The white man 's step was in the hall , on the porch and path . They heard the plowshare scrape against the gate , heard him stumble once going down the hill ; then the car door slammed and the starter touched the motor . Lucy looked down for where W.B. was standing , but W.B. had vanished . She moved instantly to the far corner of the room and was back in the kitchen with W.B. by the collar and the buggy whip raised over his head before he could lower the foot that he was putting the shoe on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You think you going to be the smart one , doing what the white man say . You think somebody going to buy you a ice cream on Saddy . You well 's to learn right now , boy . You 's a nigger , and you ai n't never going to be nothing else . You do n't learn it now you ai n't going to live to learn it tomorrow . If I do n't learn you , who is ? " The whip was keen , and her thin arm drove it terribly upon him . He danced at first , then threw up his hands and fought the blows like wasps , cried for her to stop , squirmed free and ran . He might have got away from a man , but she brought him down before he had gone two steps , and never missed a stroke . She tore his shirt to shreds and brought blood out of him , and kept rightp235on till the whip broke , teaching him , the only way she knew how , the thing she thought he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she cried , beating him , and her throat shone wet with her tears . A few minutes after Willard Follansbee had left Bud Grantham 's house , another car pulled up before the front , and Jimmy Tallant himself alighted gingerly . He saluted the young doctor who had driven him there from the hospital . " And take it easy , " said the doctor through the window . " You got everybody 's blood in Winfield County in you now . You 've about drained us dry , to tell the truth . " " They lost blood and you lost sleep . I know I put you over the jumps . Thanks for everything , Doc . " " Goodnight . If you need anything , holler . " " ' Night . " Wobbly , he felt as tall as a telephone pole , and assailed the steps to the front gallery like an old man . From the- room he peered out to the back porch where Bud still rocked and sang away , though in a calmer style than when the meeting fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angel feet have trod , With its mighty waters everFlowing by the throne of God ? " Yes , we 'll gather at the river . . . " " Well , I 'll be damned , " said Jimmy to himself . He entered the room where he knew Bella would be staying . He propped a pillow against the headboard of the bed , and let himself down with a sigh . He switched on the bedside light top236see the time . In the crib , the baby opened its eyes and regarded him in Indian silence from under the spiky jut of hair . " Hi , Buster , " said Jimmy . The baby knotted its fists to yawn , squirmed , and went back to sleep . Jimmy turned out the light . " Is that you , honey baby ? " Bud asked from the porch . The more Jimmy thought about answering , the less he seemed to find the strength to do it . " Your old daddy 's been setting here thinking tonight , sugar foot , " said Bud , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting tomorrow night . I 'm tired to death studying about this election , and I do n't want dealing with them New Orleans fellows , no more than Jimmy did . I 'm weary of this wicked earth , and if that preacher do n't watch out I 'll rise and tell it right out in front of everybody . Bud Grantham was raised to know left from right good as any . My mother was as fine a woman as ever walked the earth . I 'm going on to bed now , baby . " " Well , I 'll be damned , " Jimmy said to himself again , hearing Bud 's steps pass down the back gallery toward the bathroom . The bed where Jimmy lay stood near the front windows of the house , and when the shade was raised one could watch the highwaydown the distance of the gravel drive . Bud 's house had stood there long before they had straightened the roads and paved them . It had once been a country place , hard to get to as any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could get wrapped in a newspaper by driving around to the back and blinking the lights three times . In those days there was every size of child around the house to play with , and every kind of dog to hunt with . As a boy , Jimmy used to go home with Granthams from school , spend the night or the weekend , hunt for coon and ' possum . There had been a well in the back yard  --  you let a tin pipe down for the water ; at night in winter you could hear the dogs under the house when they scuffled for comfort , bumping the beams , or dreamed about a rabbit , or yawned with the high Iiii sound . In summer there were peaches like gold to eat , all off three or four old trees that grewp237on the slope where you went down to the still . And the still itself , all bowered thick in green brush , vine and secret path , was the place of rite and the hushed tone : with solemnity  --  pride and humility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now there was the highway instead of the old crooked road ( which the supervisors had at least graveled better than any other road in the county ) , and water came in pipes ; the still was gone in favor of the Idle Hour , and whisky , though wrapped in a newspaperthe same as ever , bore a bonded government stamp and a different flavor . No wonder Bud Grantham was weary of this wicked earth . Jimmy Tallant got pretty sick of it himself . A car eased off the highway , and approached the house so slowly that when it stopped at the front steps the wheels scarcely turned at all . Bella 's voice came distinctly , the instant the motor died . " How in the world did you know where I was at is what I ca n't figure out . " Another voice , a man 's , was not so clear . " Oh , " said Bella . " They told you because they 'd seen me go past to the meeting . " The man talked so long then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bella kept saying over and over , " Well , I think you 're just the sweetest thing . " Then she said , " But you just do n't know how crazy I am about Jimmy . He 's the sweetest thing in the world . " Then she said , " I feel right bad about the baby myself , that is , if favor means anything . I 'm not for sure . Some say it does , some say not . " And finally she said , getting out of the car , " But I think you 're just the sweetest thing in the world , Mr. Pilston . " " Well , I 'll be goddamned , " said Jimmy to himself . When she tipped in and closed the bedroom door , she switched on the light and nearly shrieked . " Hush , " said Jimmy . " Bud 's asleep and so 's the baby . " " Were you wake ? Were you there all the time ? " " No , I been asleep too . I just now woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been down to the tent meeting . There was a man drove me home . " " Who was it ? " " One of them Moreheads from over in Leflore . He was at the meeting . " " Which one ? Angus ? " " Not him . It was one I never have seen before . Funny , I ca n't call his name . He asked about you . " " That right ? " " I thought maybe you heard the car and all . I just did n't want you to think nothing . " " I see . " Suddenly , she beamed . She came to him and gave him a great big kiss . " How you feel , darling ? " " Mighty puny , " said Jimmy . " Can I get you anything ? How about a glass of sweet milk ? " " I was aiming to tell you soon as you got back , Bella . I think I best go down to sleep in the Idle Hour . The house is probably in a mess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You ca n't sleep with me ! " " I 'm too stove up , honey . You know that . We could n't have any fun anyway . " " Oh . Well , how long 's it going to be , Jimmy ? Before we can ? " " I do n't know . " He loosened a hangnail with his thumb . " Doc says a year or two . " " A year ! " Her mouth seemed to have fallen permanently open . " How 's the preacher ? " Jimmy asked . " Any good ? " " I just ca n't stand it , Jimmy . What on earth am I going to do ? I never heard of such a thing as that . The doctor told me the bullet went through the lower part of your right lung and the upper part of your stomach , and that the most delicate operation he ever performed was getting it out of you and sewing you back up again , but I do n't see why your lung and your stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with the rest of you . " " My injuries , " he said , fending her off , " are my own business.  |p239Do  n't mess with me , Bella . You know I had three hemorrhages in the hospital , doing no more than lying flat on my back . " " Yeah , I know , Jimmy , but a year  --  ! " " At the least . Maybe two . " She sat with her hands knotted in her lap . " You remember that Mr. Pilston ? " she said suddenly . " Sure , I remember him . " " Well , if there ever was anything between him and me , which everybody thought there was on account of the baby took a notion to look like him  --  I ai n't saying there was , understand ?  --  but if there was , then it was mainly your fault . " " My fault ! I do n't know how in the hell you figure that . " " Well , it was because I was so crazy about you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would n't . If you got drunk you 'd dance with me , tell me how pretty I was and all , but sober you would n't look at me twice except to poke fun at me . It was then I got frustrated . " " You got what ? " " Frustrated . " " You 're still reading those blooming magazines . " " Well , if it 's true , does it matter whereabouts I found it ? " " I reckon not , honey . " " I got to feeling like if you would n't pay me any mind , I wished somebody would come along who would pay me some mind . The word they use for that is frustration . " " I think you 're a nice girl , honey , " said Jimmy , and kissed her on the forehead . " I do n't blame you for anything you 've done . Now you find me a blanket or two because I 'm so weak I 'm liable to get cold even in this weather , and fetch me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nothing would do but that she went down to the Idle Hour with him and made the bed for him . " I meant to ask Bud , " he said . " Has Follansbee been around ? " " He was out here tonight before I went to the meeting . " " What 'd he say ? Anything ? "  | " Lucy came to look after the baby for me . He was trying to get out of her where Beck was . Said if he found Beck he was going to treat him the same as if Beck had raped a white woman . " " God , " said Jimmy . " What a scummy joker that Follansbee is . " Jimmy , darling , just let me stay down here with you a little old while . " " I 'm tired out , honey . I 'm so weak I 'm folding up . " " Well . " She plumped the pillow and laid it straight , but he propped it against the headboard and lay down as he had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and picked up the flashlight . At the door she turned . " You do n't love me , " she told him quietly . " That 's the whole thing . " She went away behind the flashlight beam , through the dark . He stayed for some time without moving to undress , twirling a penny box of matches between his thumb and forefinger . He tossed it aside , pulled himself up , and went through to the office , where he found first the light switch , then the telephone , and dialed a number . " Hi , Tink , " he said happily . " Jimmy ! Where are you ? " " Back home . " " But you were n't supposed to be out till next week . " " There was some woman having twins across the hall . They decided I 'd be better off at home . " " Do you feel all right ? " " Sure , I 'm fine . Oh , Tinker , thanks for the transfusion . " " Do n't mention it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right type . " " I 'm having cards engraved to mail out . You 'll both get one . "  |p241She  giggled . " How are things , Tink ? " " Okay . Everything 's okay . " " Then I guess Harper must be home . " " Yes , he is . You want to talk to him ? " " Please . " A moment later Duncan 's clear voice was saying hello . What do n't I like about him , Jimmy wondered , all aside from hating his guts for marrying Tinker . There 's something else .... " I appreciated you offering me some of your blood , Harper . " " I tried , " said Duncan , " but it was n't the same type . " " They tell me , " said Jimmy , " that I 've got the commonest damn blood there is . " " What class does that put me in ? " " The blue class , probably . Say , Harper , you know you kept deviling me up at the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've thought it over . Follansbee 's out to get Dozer . I was afraid of that all along . I do n't like to do this on account of Bud . But all things being considered I 'm ready to turn everything I know over to you . " Duncan said , after a moment , " What kind of a deal is this ? " " No deal at all . I 'm on the level . I ca n't locate Dozer for you , but I can fix it so everybody will know he had nothing to do with it . If you want to drive out here , we can fix up a statement . " " A statement on what ? " " You may not know . There were some gambling gentlemen from New Orleans by to see me that day  --  " " I had a very good source of information about that . In fact , she was just the other side of the door . " " Let 's keep her out of this . " " You listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hospital keeping shut-mouthed for two and a half weeks while this thing of Dozer got good and hot from one end of the county to the other . What happened could happen ; you were sitting back to let this election fall right in your lap . As long as Woolbright andp242me were on the spot you were willing to watch us fry . Now you 've got word the tide has turned . As a matter of fact , I 'm at home waiting for New Orleans to call any minute . You need n't think you can jump on the band wagon and good as say to everybody , Look what I did ! Kerney and I broke this thing and we 're about to break you and you know it . You 've had your chance . You 've got less sense of public good than any man I ever saw , and if you ask me  --  " He stopped . " Finish it , " said Jimmy . " You were going to say I came by it naturally . " " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you 'd come around sooner it would be different . But here at the eleventh hour  --  We do n't want your help , Tallant . That 's all . " Jimmy replaced the telephone , switched out the light , and closed the dusty office . When he gained the bed and sank down again , he was shaking . He remembered what Bud Grantham had said through the window : Weary of this wicked earth . But Bud could do what Jimmy could n't . Bud would rise in a meeting someday , if not this summer , then the next one , and tell his sins and let Jesus save him . When all the doors were shut , a lot of folks knocked at that one . They claimed it always opened . Well , I 'll never know , Jimmy thought . I even tried to get that boy to kill me , he thought , hardly believingit all himself . Even that did n't work , though it might have if Tinker had n't come . . . Tinker Taylor . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read what it said on the cover , when his hand grew tired as death ; he let it fall , and presently he slept.  |p245In  New Orleans , in the summer , the early morning is apt to have a false freshness , as if somebody had sprayed a big black stevedore with cologne . About ten the city begins to sweat : the sun is like a red-hot stove lid , only nobody looks at the sun , the heat being a condition in which one exists , and is not to be seen any more than air or the grace of God . All the subtle diplomacies of civilization enter into circumventing the heat : it obviously can not be met on open field . There is air conditioning now for everything from movie palaces to dim little bars , but there are patios too , and latticed porches , shuttered windows , and polished hallways deep down the stairwell with old glass shielded from the glare . In Audubon Park the swans drift to the shade as it blackens , and down on Tchoupatoulos Street women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an electric fan looks at them with one big eye from head to toe , toe to head , while they nap in the afternoon . With a car , you can take the shore drive along Lake Pontchartrain , though there is no shade and sometimes even the breeze off the water is hot . Down in the French Quarter you can buy tall frosted glasses with minty mixtures , cold as snow , though alcohol is always heating and will give you an awful wallop when you go out again . Then there are the oyster bars . The oysters come in every day out of the beds in the river and the lake , and it is supposed to be dangerous to eat them in the summer , but they are kept directly on ice and are so good , especially when you have a hangover , that to many people it is worth the chance . A man takes them off the ice and breaks them open with an oyster knife and serves them by the dozen on a plate of ice . You can mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sauce , lemon juice , and a dash of horseradish ,  |p246though  for an uneasy stomach lemon juice alone is enough . These , along with a tall cold glass of beer , will go a long way toward fortifying the soul to endure the heat of the day . There is not much crime in New Orleans in the summer . At night , on weekends , Negroes carve each other to fancy bits with a razor , but if you put all the Negro crimes in the paper there would be no room for international affairs . Down on Bourbon Street , which burns at night like a pool of oil , homosexuals sometimesmake nasty petulant scenes in the bars . But a people so earnestly concerned with keeping cool do not find the materials of crime ready to hand , and nothing about the young man who was eating oysters and drinking beer and the older man who had joined him would have told the waiter that one was from the intricate society of the underworld and the other a plainclothes man from the city detectives . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been about the weather , how hot it was . " You seen Sam ? " the older man asked the young one . He picked his teeth with a match stub and watched the other lift an oyster till it severed from the shell . " Not since last night . I wo n't see him either . He fired me . " " What you plan to do now ? " " I 'm fixing to go back home , I reckon . " The oyster glided down his throat . He took a swallow of beer . " It ai n't nothing like New Orleans , but maybe that 's a good thing . " " What is home at ? " " Up in Mississippi . Up in Tippah County . " " Well , there 's one thing certain . " " What 's that ? " " You might go back to Tippah County , but you sure got to detour by Winfield . " An oyster actually paused in the boy 's throat . " Sam , " he said , and swallowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sonofabitch . He told on me . If they was to tell on each other , they 'd startp247shooting . It just goes to show you , I ai n't one of them . They knew it and I knew it . I never was . " " There are n't any charges I know of . You 're just wanted to give evidence . " The detective ordered himself a beer , then , on second thought , a half-dozen oysters . " There could n't be any charges , because I never tried to do nothing . It was completely accidental . It was the first shot I missed since four years ago when Unker Chollie Klappert said , If you 'll go real easy you can shoot the marker off that hen 's foot . ' But she lifted her foot up somehow or ' nother and the bullet nicked her on the leg , so Unker Chollie said we was obliged to have her for dinner . " " Yes , and what about this other little accident ? Just how did it happen ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the boy said . " I always did like Mr. Tallant , though I never had met him but one time before , but the time we drove up in Miss'ippi to see him , we found ourselves to be kinfolks . Sure did . He was one of Unker Chollie 's cousins , the one I was just now talking about with the hen . I do n't know which side of the family , so maybe we was only connected . Anyway I sure did like him . If I was just ranking the folks I know I 'd rather shoot by accident , I 'd put him closer to the bottom than anybody outside of Unker Chollie Klappert and Aunt Darr . And Mama , naturally . Never seen him but twice . But that 's how I feel about it . " " Yeah , so how did this get to happen ? " " Sam and Pilston and Mitchell went up there to Franklin to see about farming out some gambling equipment . They were going to put some money into the sheriff 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Tallant did n't much want to trade with them about the election . About that time Mr. Tallant 's wife come in toting a baby which Sam said later was Pilston to the life , though I could n't notice much resemblance . Do n't never seem to me a little baby looks like anything , let alone anybody . Yet there 's themp248that claim to see it . I do n't reckon that 's got the world and all to do with anything , except then was when Mr. Tallant got up and left the room . Sam sent me and Mitchell after him to bring him back and settle up about the election . " " So then ? " " So then we followed him on back of the roadhouse across a pasture and down a hill , back to the edge of a field where some woods started . We hollered to him to come on back , and Mitchell said , You better do like we tell you ; this boy here 's got a gun . ' He turned around and started laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . He said , You better take the gun yourself , Mitchell . You 'll never get that boy to shoot me . I wish you could . Me and Wally 's kinfolks , and what you asking for ai n't done . But then I tell you , Wally , ' he said , I hone to see how good you can shoot . You take this four-bit piece and when I thumb it in the air like that '  --  he thumbed it  --  ' you see can you bring it down for me . ' He thumbed it up again and when he stopped talking he looked at me and stopped laughing . He had the saddest face I ever saw . It was mournful . It called to mind a song Unker Chollie said he used to get on the old earphone radio set out of Shreseport , went Look down , look down that lonesome road before you travel on . ' I always liked that song and thought it many 's the time traveling round in the car with Sam and Mitchell and them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb and saying , How good can you shoot now , sure enough ? It must be a sight to behold . ' So I said , It is a sight . ' Then he said , real soft , Then shoot for me , Wally , ' and he thumbed the coin , but where it had been sailing up free towards the trees it missed that time and only went about a foot high ; I guess it never cleared him . Then was when I shot , having made up my mind to it . I do n't know if you know anything about shooting or not , but once your mind tells your finger to pull that trigger it do n't make no difference if a elephant gets in the way , you 're going to shoot.  | " It must be laying somewhere around there still , that four-bit piece , plugged . For I hit it , and him too . The minute I saw what had happened , I started to run towards him , but Mitchell grabbed me and got the gun out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill , ' he said . Do n't , you 'll stay down here and keep him company . ' Mitchell taken charge of everything . He seen a nigger down the hill , down in the bottom , and went on back to scare him away so he could n't tell he seen us there . " It was later we heard from up there that Mister Tallant was n't dead . I was mighty glad to hear it . Glad ! I was downright thank-ful . " " It squares with what Mitchell says , " said the detective , " almostword for word . " He dusted the cracker crumbs from his mouth and polished off his beer . " I got to go send a wire up to Winfield County . Seems they had all decided that nigger you say Mitchell scared off had done the shooting , and some boy up there is having a hell of a time getting elected sheriff when he could n't find the nigger or you either . " " I ca n't say how it happened , except by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes pulling at me . You believe in himotism ? Maybe he himotized me . " " Where you going to be ? " " Right here . " " Not going to hunt up Sam ? " " That bastard better stay away from me . Him and his talk about the code . ' " " He never told you to hit Tallant . What accident you had was your accident . I think Sam 's played it straight . If you 'd done it for him , he 'd have backed you . " " He could have told me . Talked to him an hour last night . All he said was he could n't afford me any more . Never mentioned Mr. Tallant , Winfield County , Miss'ippi , or Highway 82 . " " I reckon he was scared anybody that could have one accident like that could have two . "  |p251with  a flopping sound that seemed to be part of what she said . " I think you do n't git yo'se'f right straight on back over to Humphreys County , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duncan ai n't the onliest one got the word for you . I seen that other'n running for shurf , Mister Willard Follansbee  --  he claim do he see you first he going to do you like what they does when a nigger get with a white woman . " " Unker Beck , " said W.B. , coming in in his shirttail , " Aunt Lucy done frail the life outer me . " " You think you telling sump'n , " Lucy said . " Well , you ai n't . " " Come here , boy , " said Beck . " Lord , Lucy . You 'd think he was mixed up with a wildcat . Time going to come , W.B. , when you going to go wheresoever you feels called on to go , no matter who tries to stop you . Is that right ? " " Sho ' right , Unker Beck . " " Do n't call me uncle any more , W.B. I 'm your blood daddy , son . You are my own natural child . " Lucy stopped still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Beck , but every time he brought out something fresh , he gentled her more . " I been knowing it all the time , Beck . But he ai n't . W.B. ai n't . " " I sho ' ai n't , " W.B. said , in soft self-contemplation . " Where his manna at ? " Lucy asked . " She in England , where she always was . In London . You do n't have to know all about it , Lucy . She wrote me a letter saying she could n't work and keep him too and that her husband was working too and wanted shut of him , since he was black . She said if I 'd send her the money there was an American woman getting a divorce and coming back to the U.S. , and she could get him in by her . Either that or she 'd put him in a home over there . She would have done it too . All them folks over there in England , they take their children when they ai n't no bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're shut of them , they do n't have to see them much more . So I wrote her to send this child to me . That was the time I went up North . It all worked out . The **27;10015;TOOLONG William had gone off to the hospital , John rose and dressed himself . Against the protests of Dorothea and the genuinely distressedcries of Duncan , he went back to the School . In his wrinkled clothing , with his hair flying in orange greasy strands , with near a week 's growth of beard on his face , and with his bones protruding , he appeared before the students in the dissection room , swaying , beside himself with rage . One by one the students quieted , stared . But he was concerned with but one person in that room . He saw only William Hewson going quietly from table to table , proctoring the dissections . At last , Hewson , sensing the tension , looked up . He laid down his probe and made his way across the room . Keeping his voice low and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior tone , that soothingbut regulating voice ! ) , he placed his hand on John 's arm and turned him out of the doorway . " Sir , you are still too  --  " " Are you a physician , sir ? " John said furiously . " Are you qualified to diagnose my condition ? " " Dr. William told me only this morning that you were much too weak to return yet , Mr. John . " " Did he , " John said . " Dr. Hunter and his new assistant conferring on my health ! " " That was not the way of it , Mr. John , " Hewson insisted . " It came about in another manner . I asked him if I should destroy the preparation you were working on when you became ill . " " Destroy it ? " " It was beginning to putrefy rather badly , sir . And I wished Dr. Hunter to tell me whether to get rid of it , or to continue with it . " The ravaged face swung close to Hewson 's ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bleeding gums , but John was not smiling . " Continue ? Continue with my preparation of the lymphatics ? " " Yes , Mr. John , " Hewson said steadily . " However it was too , putrescent  --  " John slapped him brutally across the mouth . " God damn you , . God damn you , I ought to kill you , I ought to twist your neck . . . God damn you . . . . " Hewson stood immobile , though his face grew white , then pink , . where John 's hand had smarted it . After a moment or so he quietly turned and went back into the dissection room , leaving John leaning ,  |p201against  the wall in the hall , struggling to catch his breath and sobbing weakly . This time he was found , comatose , in an alley in Alsatia . And oddly enough by Howison , who , having been told that a dead man was lying behind a certain house , had taken his sack with him , to discover with a cry of dismay that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have rented a house out in Earl 's Court , " John heard William saying to someone . " I think he will be comfortable there . " Dorothea said , " William , in God 's name , let me go with him and care for him ! " " I can not , Sister . He is vile and disorderly . He is a hopeless wastrel , a drunkard . Would you like your Mr. Baillie to see him in such a condition ? Do you think he would care to marry into such a family ? No , he will be better off with Hewson . The lad is strong and level-headed , he 'll keep our Jockie out of mischief . " " But if Hewson is at the School during the day  --  " William interrupted with some impatience , " Sister , I know from my own experience with him that he does not become really drunk until evening . During the day , though he is far from sober , he is , at least , rational . " William 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone else in the room . " Ah , there you are , Hewson . " Hewson said , " I shall do my best to care for him , Doctor . " " Of course you will . He 'll be fit enough as soon as the weather warms . " He has decided to hide me away , John thought dimly . Hide me away with Howison . . . with Hewson . . . His chest was packed with old rags , William had made a preparation of his burning lungs , packing them with rags soaked in spirits . Dorothea cried , " William ! You speak of him as if he  --  William , he is our brother ! " William said , as if he had discovered a gobbet of something foul in his mouth and was spitting it out , " I have no brother , Dorothea . Jamie has been dead for years . I have no brother . "  |p202Someone  began to cry softly until the door closed quietly on the sound . He was treated like a convalescent and petulant brat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation of the injected testes , his series on the congenital hernia , and his present preparations on the lymphatics . Howison dropped in often , complaining cheerfully of his long walk to the country cottage where John was hidden away , and carrying , like a matron , a jar of hot broth , a bottle of wine and an anatomical tidbit in a sack together . He was always bringing an infant , or a small spotted cat from the ' Change menagerie , or , if he could find nothing else , the mangled remains of a bulldog . He hoped in a brusque cheery voice that Mr. Jock could find some use or other for them . Oh , pray , Mr. Jock , put your money away . It is but a little gift ! Each evening young Hewson , pleasant and dependable , came home full of gossip about the School and the folk of the Garden . He coaxed John to eat the supper the neighbor-woman cook had prepared for him , and which John had let stand unnoticed . He handed John this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits on the shelf , and moved that over there , and varnished endlessly , making each stroke exactly as John demanded . And he saw to it that there was always a supply of port , so that John would not have to go out into the raw spring wind for it . As the night wore on , he patiently argued John into bed , then saw , before taking his own rest , that the drunken man was covered against the cold of the night . When he rose in the morning , he straightened the bedclothes , pulling them up neatly over John 's burning chest , and then filled John 's glass with water so that he could wet his parched mouth and throat before rising . Next the glass there were always a few tarts or buns , or fruit as the spring wore on , for John 's breakfast . He thus managed to serve John 's every want without once appearing servile . He was , John was forced to admit , excellent company . For a country lad , and for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he was , if not by birth , by nature , noble . John found himself growing quite fond of him.  |p203William  did not come to the little house in Earl 's Court , though he was several times out at St. George 's , not too far away . Hewson said that Dr. Hunter had gone to St. George 's in January on some businessof the court of governors . And that the court had elected two new surgical assistants to the staff  --  a Henry Sandys , and a John Gunning . Hewson was somewhat startled at the savagery with which John laughed at the tidings . When John was alone he did only those two things of which he seemed capable . He worked , and he drank wine to sustain him as he worked . Still weak , his chest burning each time it rained , he sat hour on hour at his table bent over his preparations . Slowly , slowly , as if he were creating , the lymphatics revealed themselves , the varied , multitudinous and minute tubules unraveling under his shaking hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had been trying to keep even from himself came to prominence in his mind . The amount of wine he drank decreased daily  --  he found himself actuallypouring it out of the window to dispose of it . For his body still exhibited the effects of excess ; he was often nauseated , his eyes seemed to slide out of focus , he staggered if he rose too suddenly or even threw up his head . As he worked , some part of him withdrew to study and worry . And as the days grew longer , and the sun warmer , and the black shadows of summer lay under the trees outside his window , it seemed as if the bright sun were casting some growing shadow in his mind . He found himself staring out the window at the fields and trees one day , his preparation forgotten , as he asked himself : How did it happen ? When did it start ? For it had not been as he had thought , a slow , imperceptible change , subject to control at every point ; no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I acknowledged one night that William was not walking perfection , he thought . No , not even then ; it had been but the work of a moment , occurring in the time it took William 's pulse watch to run down , for his will to ruin to come into possession of him . In the passageof one minute sometime during that dark and drunken night he had lost William , and so had lost himself.  |p204The  shadow lengthened somewhat , he was made aware of it when Hewson came to him one evening . " A Dr. Shippen was at the School looking for you today , Jock . " " Who ? " " Dr. Shippen . " Hewson was looking at him curiously . " He said he was a student just last year . You must remember him . " " What does he look like ? " Hewson grinned . " Like an American . " " Ha . He died . He died of hospital fever and his tongue is over there on the shelf . " Hewson was looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright as if tears were standing in them . " Or , mayhap , " John added carelessly , " that preparation is still at the School . " " Jock , you are working too hard , " Hewson said . " Could you not put it aside for tonight ? " John grew crafty . " What did he want , this Dr. American ? " " He wished to invite you to his wedding . " " Can he not tup her without my help ? " John wanted to know wittily , but his tongue slurred the words . Again he saw the shine of Hewson 's gaze . It was irritating to be stared at in that manner , to be gawked at like a freak . " Damn you , what are you staring at ? Go stare at the moon , I have work to do ! " Then , because it was a clear warm Sunday afternoon , and because he was happily tipsy on two mere glasses of wine , he decided to attendShippen 's wedding after all . He and Hewson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop off at each tavern they passed on their way to the church and toast her youth and her beauty and her  --  He was growing rather anatomical on the subject , he realized . And if his priggish keeper , Hewson , wished to stay home at Earl 's Court , that was his privilege . He could stay home and wear his mouth like his ass-hole all day , for all John " I 'll go with you ! " Hewson cried with no little trepidation . He then had some difficulty getting John out of the house emptyhanded ; for John had made a diligent search among his jars and bottles to select just the right preparation as a present for the bride.  |p205The  one he chose , Hewson announced in despair , was exactly the one he might have been expected to choose  --  in his condition . Throughout the ceremony , John swayed against Hewson 's steady arm and ogled the pretty maidens in front of him . All blue-eyed , all dainty , all scented like a bed of varicolored posies , and all aquiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to befall her , they attracted John so that he felt young and bullish as he had not since his attack of lung fever . When he leaned too far forward , Hewson , downy Scotch cheeks stern , pulled him back . John chuckled . In a row , pair upon pair of blue eyes in white faces poised on waving slim stalks  --  like necks , John thought , exactly like necks  --  turned round to glower on him . He smiled back eagerly , unaware that his teeth were bloody . Mayhap because the afternoon walk to town had been so warm , or because . he had insisted on stopping time and again to down a glass of ale  --  whatever the reason  --  when he was completely off his guard , still smiling oafishly at the glaring maidens , a deep , satisfying , and lengthy roiling of his stomach rolled like thunder from him . Beside him , Hewson sighed . The posies bent their heads together , a thin giggle escaping from their midst . They were laughing at him ; one putting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nostrils , and indicating John with a nod . His manly pride was flayed by the gesture . He had been thinking he was making a conquest . . . . He grew drunkenly wrathful . Young bitches . . . ought to pinch their saucy asses for them . . . ought to put that one in pink to bed . . . ought to do it , bygar , rip her pretty pink dress from her pretty pink ass " Jock ! " Hewson whispered , panicky . Gods ! had he been muttering ? Somehow Hewson got him away from the wedding party before he had started on his bawdy ballads . John thought it a pity that Dr. Shippen and his pretty bride , Alice , be deprived of music , but he gave of it freely to the countryside all the way home . Staggering into the cottage , red-faced and breathless , John approachedhis preparation . Hewson began persuasively , " Jock , would you not like to rest ? " " . . . work , " John said . " Work . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet-nurse him , then , as summer drew to a close , Hewson himself brought up the matter . " I am thinking of going to Edinburgh , Jock . If . . . if you feel sufficiently  --  " " If I can consider myself weaned ? " John asked . " Is that what you want to know ? Am I weaned from your puerile chaperonage  --  " " Pray , do not put your words into my mouth , " Hewson said with a touch of asperity . " I meant no such thing . It is only that I wish to continue my education . " Feeling the oaf , John muttered , " Aye , and so you should . ' T is not fair that you should be wasting your time with the likes of me . " And too , he thought selfishly , he had little need of Hewson any longer . The work on the lymphatics was nearly completed , his health was fair , and he and his wine had come to an understanding . A glass would but temper the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease his chest , though several would fell him  --  but the nauesa always came first to warn him . " I hope , " he said to Hewson , feeling his way carefully , " that my brother has paid you what you deserve for your  --  ahh  --  kindness to me . " " It was not a matter of payment , Jock , " Hewson said faintly . " Then you have let William take advantage of you . " " Indeed no ! I have learned much from Dr. William . And he has offered me . . . a permanent . . . " " You are now his assistant , " John said flatly . " There is no longer any possibility that I might return to the School . " " Aye , " Hewson said as if he were apologizing for some misdeed . " However , Dr. William has made it a condition of my employment that I take a year at Edinburgh . He thinks to lecture this year , but there will be no dissections . " " I congratulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known your love for anatomy was so great . I did not know of your willingness to work endlessly without credit , without praise , without even being able to claim your preparations as your own . I had not known that about you . " " It will not be that way with me , Jock . " " Indeed ? " John sneered . He waved his hand about the room.  | " And where do you think all these will go when they are completed ? Or did you not , all spring , take my work out of my very hands to carry it over to William for his lectures ? " There was a silence , and then , as one changing the subject , Hewsonremarked stubbornly , " It will not be the same with me . " " And , pray , why not ? " In a small , embarrassed voice , Hewson said , " Because I have not the worth or genius of a John Hunter . Dr. William will not be inclined to claim my work . " John laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mirth , pushing his face into Hewson 's , showering him with spittle . His chest fired with the effort but he could not cease . This country surgeon 's by-blow , this young lord of the lancet and cup , sitting there gazing at so poor a thing as a sickly failure of a stinking anatomistand fatuously offering it praise . Almost losing his balance he grasped Hewson 's shoulder to steady himself . " Lad , where is my wine ? God damn you , I need my glass of wine . . . . " The fire in his lungs was burning steadily now . Hewson was gone . He missed him . He sat for long moments , hand extended , waiting for Hewson to place what he wanted in it . He shouted his demands , and then looked about him , startled , at the empty room . Bare branches scratched against the windows and the hearth created a small puddle of warmth in the room . The Garden would be quickening now , the theaters opening for the season . Studentswould be tumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howison would be clumping his muddy feet across the dissection room at dawn , dragging a sack behind him . Or no  --  Hewson said it would not be that way this time . Then that would explain Duncan 's absence . He had been waiting daily , wryly expecting Duncan to appear with a request for the newestpreparations . But then , knowing that the work was nearing completion , even William himself might come for it . What a collection it would make for William 's preparation room ; it would almost require an entire room to itself . What was to become of him ? William had indicated that he did not deem the series of animal preparations worthy of the expense Johnp208cost him . On the other hand , he could not , for all his walking after Pott and Cheselden , hope to practice surgery , for the Examiners would never grant him a license . William had rather let his influence at Surgeons ' Hall deteriorate after he had paid his forty guineas to become disenfranchised from the Surgeons ' Company . Nor had William'sindefatigable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be able to rid himself of John that way . Why indeed was he William 's responsibility ? John could not fathom his own illogicalness . Once William had interfered in his attempt to strike out for himself ; he then , frustrated in that , had returned to fasten himself on William . Since the Oxford matter , and Polly 's enforced departure ( In truth , was I not relieved , glad to be free of her pelvic charms , for she was estranging me from Wullie ? ) , he had indulged in a prolonged tantrum . He recalled the grandiose conceits of his first anger , his fine declarations to himself that he would force William to make him a partner in the School . Secretly , unknown even to himself , it appeared , he had had another purpose . He had reverted to an earlier dream ; only the old love for William had changed , turned , like the last of dead Henry Fielding 's vinum pomonae , to vinegar . He repeated to himself : No , Wullie , you shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was done . He piled his notes together and weighted them down with a candelabrum ; William would take those notes , bits and scraps of paper , erratic notations that they were , and mold them into the precise prose of which he was a master . Fortified by a glass of wine against the cold , he went out into the wind , in search of William for the first time in almost a year . He was not at the School , and not at the house in Jermyn Street . Dorothea too was out with her intended , the Parson Baillie . Duncan stood staring at the puffy , reeking , blear-eyed wreck before him , startled out of his customary sauciness . " Mr. John ! Sir , for an instant I did not recog  --  Dr. William said he would go directly from the hospital to the School this afternoon . Mr. John , could I not give you a hit of refreshment ? A glass of  --  er  --  a cup of chocolate ? " But John had already turned away.  |p209The  School was deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those taking William 's foreshortened course were almost entirely surgeonsor physicians , with a sprinkling of artists and the merely curious  --  andaffluent . His steps resounding , he walked across the empty dissection room , running his hands in passage over the satiny scoured surfaces of the tables . Then he went into the cold parlor where Williamwas wont to house those preparations he used most frequently in his teaching . He found many of his lymphatics missing ; William must have finished with them and taken them over to his own museum in Jermyn Street . Contentment filled him in that cold room , time for him had stopped . All the projects William had desired of him , he had done . The injection of the testis , the series on the hernia congenita , and , awaiting William in the cottage at Earl 's Court , the  --  indeed , it could be so called  --  the atlas of the absorbents . A grueling task it had been , to determine the anatomy of those lymphatic vessels and glands . William discovered him musing thus , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old affection . " When to the sessions of sweet silent thought , " William said , returningthe smile , but somewhat guardedly , " I summon up remembrance of things past  --  Shakespeare . How long have you been here without a fire ? " " I have no idea , " John said . " Wullie , I have completed the lym-phatics . " " Let us get on to Jermyn Street , " William said . " I want my supper before I lecture . I had thought to bring a few preparations with me . " He lifted a jar and jerked his head toward the one next it . " Take that one , will you ? " Moving to obey , John said , " Wullie , did you not  --  Where are my lymphatic preparations ? Have you taken the ones Hewson brought you to your own museum ? " " Pray be more careful , " William said , " you very nearly pushed that one off . " " Wullie , how did the students take to the discoveries on the lym-phatics ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " as to that . . . " For some reason he set down the jar he had in his arms . " Why  --  I merely touched on the matter , Brother . " " You mean you have decided to publish instead ? "  | " Oh  --  I should think not . Until the work is finished . Although I must admit that it amply demonstrated the system to my satisfaction . " William took a deep breath and fingered his lace . " For an artist to draw the preparations , Brother , is another  --  Jock , they had to be destroyed . The preparations were not worthy of you , I could not demonstrate them to my classes ; they were collapsing , some were even putrefying ; you were very ill , Jock , and they had not that nicety of attention  --  " John swung his head about on his thick neck as if William had hidden the preparations and he was searching for them . " You did n't destroy them , Wullie . You put them away somewhere for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . William would not meet his eyes . John waited , watching William as he might a quarry . At last William lifted his head and his eyes were strikingly blue in contrast to his chalky sculptured wig . " I told you I destroyed them , Jock ! " He made an aimless motion with his hands . " I would advise you to do the same with those at Earl 's Court . Jock , surely you must have known , unless you were constantly febrile , that they were unworthy of me  --  of you  --  " His voice seemed to hang in the air questing for another word or two , even after his classic mouth lay in repose . John brushed past him on his way to the door . He looked back once to see William immobile , reserved , elegant , only tie slightest lift to his brows betraying his curiosity , his speculation , much as if he were examining some monstrosity rather than his own brother . " I 'm sorry , Jock , " he seemed to be saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son of a whore , " John said thickly , then realizing the enormity of his curse , shouted it again at the top of his voice . It was not possible that William , now calmly turning to gaze out at the busy arcades , could not have heard . He looked at his work in Earl 's Court with William 's eyes . The preparations were sloppy , inept , hacked where the finest dissection was wanting , rotting , turning to mush , to fluid , where spirits had evaporated from jars imperfectly sealed . He had to peer through the dusk in the room to see them . But Hewson would have told him if  --  The sound of water dripping as from an eave drew him to a corner . An inflated preparation , improperly , incompletely varnished ,  |p211hung  from its thread leaking a foul juice , slow drop by drop gatheringand falling to the floor . Hewson had seen only a delirious drunkardplaying with scalpel and probe and blowpipe , feverish with his industry as he desecrated and wasted and destroyed flesh . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jars to the floor . The putrefying preparations lay amid the broken glass and the odor of spirits filled the room . He ripped from threads and rent with his hands , he shattered jar after jar , until at last he stood in the bleak dusk surrounded by the wreckage of that which he had loved more dearly than his own life . He felt as if the blood in his heart had turned black from anguish , and bled in black tears down his face . Late in the night Dr. William Hunter was still restless , still plagued with an ominous dread . Impulsively he ordered his chariot brought around to his door . " Earl 's Court , Doctor ? " Duncan said . " At this hour of the night , you are planning to drive out to  --  " " Earl 's Court , I said ! " Dr. Hunter cried impatiently . In the light of his candle Dr. Hunter bent over to sort among the shards of glass on the floor . He had not realized there had been so many preparations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . The anatomist who had , at thirty-two , defined if not preserved a work on the lymphatics that was equaled in stature only by that of Harvey on the circulation , lay on the floor , unconscious in a pool of his own blood and vomit . Dr. Hunter thought : I know not whose fault this is , but I pray God it is not mine ! Like a pulse watch , John Hunter had at last run out of time . His London season was over . He would not drink William 's wine ; he sat aflame with the pain in his chest , looking helplessly at his brother . " Wullie , I came to visit you twelve years ago before joining the army . Wullie , would you not say my visit has lasted long enough ? "  | " I will speak to Robin Adair , " William said . " As you may have heard me say , he is Inspector-General of Hospitals for His Majesty 's forces . I have some little acquaintance with him . " " My thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not look well , Jock . " " Aye . . . . I have the consumption , I think . Or better , I should say that I will have it soon if I do not seek a warmer climate . The war is to the south , is it not ? " " To the south , " William agreed . John rose to leave , then paused . " A gentleman at Earl 's Court consulted me for a swelling in his groin . I believe a lymphatic vessel is inflamed . I took the liberty of referring him to you . " " I shall be most happy to help him , " William said formally . Of a sudden John said , " Wullie , do you remember when once wespoke on each man 's containing his own morbific seeds at birth ? " " Aye , Jock . " " You contained the seeds of greatness , we decided . What would you say are mine ? " " I would not venture to  --  " William began and could not finish . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On October 30 , 1760 , he received his commission as a surgeon to the army . He was to await his orders . Throughout the winter he saw William infrequently . Dorothea had married , he had not even attended her wedding . Now , free of his grinding compulsion to work , he walked the white fields of winter . All his days stood at the endless hour of dusk . His orders came . He was gazetted with a regiment of Milord Loudon 's . He was to proceed to Portsmouth at once to join his regiment there . After twelve years in London to whom would he bid farewell ? There were Howison and his entourage of sometime highwaymen and cutthroats to wish him Godspeed . And someone else , surely ? Ah yes , it would be but common courtesy to take his leave of the eminentDr . William Hunter . His day of departure arrived . He took the flyer to Portsmouth , hisp213baggage a change of linen and his ivory-handled lancet . He wore , as always , a discarded suit of William 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was newly shorn of his bright hair and adorned with a regulation military wig . He leaned out of the window to look back at the dome of St. Paul 's . A dozen years ago he had first seen it rising through a mist of rain . . . . It was I  --  he thought suddenly  --  I was Wullie 's War.  |p215SUFFICE  it to say that England was and had been at war for some time . It had something to do with the King of Prussia , and France , and the American territories , and numerous other issues which Mr. Pitt , the War Minister , might give at length . For a certain John Hunter , it was enough that there was a war to which he could escape , and Mr. Pitt was to him that gentleman whose son was delivered a year or so back by none other than Dr. William Hunter , the **37;10044;TOOLONG . ( This feat of valor took place in another war intirely , and we should no longer concern ourselves with it here . ) The expedition under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a military secret . Consequentlyit was soon known by all in Portsmouth that the expeditionwould be directed against Belle Isle , a small island in the possession of the French , lying about eight miles off the Brittany coast . The reasons advanced for the taking of Belle Isle were that it would allow the British to command the French coast , and later , would serve as a bargaining point when the war was won . Portsmouth , that town of red-faced roughs , press gangs , and decrepitlingering sailors , lay some seventy-two miles south of London . To the stranger to matters naval it was another world . Whipped byp216salty winds the year round , choked by thick cottony fogs . The town brawled and mobbed and slew lustily , seamen 's exhilaration at being released temporarily from the great wooden ships being what it was . During the war the press gangs were never so busy , and no man or lad over twelve was safe were he whole in limb . The sea awaited all just beyond the long sandbank running out from the land which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Spithead , and here were the great roads of Portsmouth wherein the men-of-war could anchor . It was said that a thousand sail could lie in the roads of Portsmouth , though none had ever seen such a sight . Among the sail anchored there toward the end of March 1761 , were ten sail of men-of-war with a convoy of troop transport ships , frigates , bomb ketches , fire ships , and sloops , under the command of Keppel , assembled for the ascent of Hodgson 's land forces . On a raw gray morning the troops , almost ten thousand strong , formed at the dockyard , their bright coats and colors in startling contrast to the hueless world about them . The flatboats , each manned by twenty to twenty-four oarsmen lay , row on row , against the shore to receive them . The drums rolled , the officers straightened their swords , the men shouldered their muskets , and the columns began to move forward . The Whitmores , the Beauclerks , the Panmures , the Loudons , the Erskines , the Crawfords , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the flatboats . Within two minutes sixty men could board a boat and leave the shore . In orcerly rows the boats moved across the water carrying downy-cheeked novices clutching their muskets , staring straight ahead ; and carrying too the veterans , who looked back wistfully , long since grown tired of this war which had been dragging on for five years now , and which , as far as they knew , was originally the concern of Frederick II and a trio of wrangling women , composed of two queens and a French bawd , and should have remained that way . Now almost ten thousand men were in passage between two worlds , the one that lay ahead seeming to rise and descend with every motion of the flatboats , and striking no particular joy to their hearts . The sea moved about a bit too much to suit any except , perhaps , the marines , who cared about nothing in the world or they would not be marines . In the great roads the waiting ships rocked gently , every yard covered with sailors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frigates , sloops , even the transportsand bomb ketches looked to the approaching troops as if theywere swarming with bees . Strange men , these , the land forces thought , who could stand at their ease rocking back and forth in great sweeps halfway up to heaven . They could not take their eyes from the sight , their stomachs glumly disagreeing with their quickeningpulses . The veterans groaned at the thought of the foul , crammed bellies of the transports , of the casks of putrefying salt meat they would consume , of the hammocks awaiting their sparse covered bones , which would , after a few days ' time , give them racking backachesand cause their water to come reluctantly with much burning , dribbling from them in clouded amber trickles . Those who had not yet completely recovered from their last bout of scurvy looked at the ladders they were to ascend and then down at the water , as if debating which course to take . The sailors taunted the land forces cruelly as they came aboard , missing not one frightened grin nor jellied gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind died and the fog moved in . Packed in the transports , the Exchange , the Rachael , the Britannia , the Hopewell , the Amity , and the Mary Ann , the land forces grew contentious . Beneath the gun deck , and just at the water 's line lay the berth deck wherein the petty quarreling and bickering among the officers began . And beneath the berth deck , far below the water , in a dank smelly hole known as the cockpit , the regimental surgeons settled down to flick at one another with tongues sharp as lancets . Ever a gossipy bunch , they found much worthy of comment in the person of a newcomer to their midst , a laconic creature with rare and distinguished connections . As the days passed , and the expeditionstill lay in the roads at anchor , the gossip grew as thick as the fog that drifted down the hatchways . So much was known about the strange surgeon : he was a staff surgeon temporarily attached to the 1 oudons , he was the younger brother of Dr. William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he had gathered unto himself , deservedly or no , the surgeons would not venture to say , a reputation for being a fair anatomist . Rumor had it that he had left London under a cloud . Many hours passed pleasantly enough while the exact nature ofp218this disgrace was discussed both conjecturally and jestingly . The objectof the gossip spent most of his waking hours on the quarterdeckfighting nausea and staring alternately at the gulls or down through the fog at the greasy , garbage-filled water . At mess he was silent , uncommunicative , ill . Ofttimes he lay in his hammock , eyes closed , apparently miserable . All noticed that his hands trembled and that he had a cough which was almost a mannerism  --  a dry " huffhuff " which burst from him as naturally as breathing and to which he paid no notice . Several of the kindlier gentlemen suggested that he had left London for his health . " And when , " another gentleman wanted to know , " was scurvy and a musket ball in the gut discovered to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you seen him aught but sober ? " " No . . . But he has the look . " Had they but asked the surgeon in question he would have told them freely all they wished to know . He had obtained his commission as an expedient , for he was not able to practice in London . In short , though he was considered competent enough to attend men who fought for their King , he was inadequately equipped to tamper with civilian subjects . He would have answered them freely because he had not a care in the world . This is not always an ideal state . Still there was no wind . The men in the Britannia broke into the rum stores and then brawled . For diversion several of the brawlers were flogged  --  one of them had almost the entire length of his spinalcolumn laid bare  --  and thrown into the bilge . They would not be granted surgical care for at least a day ; and so , still idle , the surgeonsgossiped on . There was a great deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tidbits were carried down to the cockpit . Then suddenly the fog lifted , and a slight breeze sprang up . On the morning of March 29 the men-of-war began a restless wallowing , and the captain of the flagship , the Valiant , proclaimed that a wind had risen that was just abaft the beam . The signals were hoisted , the seamen sprang to the rigging , and the cry went up that there was a fair wind abroad . Near noon the virgin sails snapped in the wind , billowing out , and the sailors cursed at the chaffing they had received from the iron-stiff canvas . On the deck of the Britan/nia , the seasick surgeon lifted his head from his contemplation of the water and looked about as if emerging from a coma . Though the fog was gone , the day was dull , sea and sky without depth , shaded as a gull 's wing . He watched the Valiant , in full sail , majestic , powerful , deadly with her seventy-four guns , thrust her bowsprit toward the horizon . After her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep in the water . Above him a sail took the wind with a crack like a cannon burst . Of a sudden the sun broke through the overcast , as if in that moment the restless world of the sea and the great sails had just been created . The men-of-war  --  the Valiant , whip pennant snapping , the Sandwich , the Dragon , the Temeraire herding the six clumsy transports down the channel  --  moved in sparkling splendor , their masts fragile against the urgings of the canvas ; moved belly-deep out onto the curving emerald world . Behind lay all that was England , ahead there were only sail and mast , the ponderous and the gracile ; and the bowsprits sharp as couching needles , and aft the plump poops riding high . Alongside gamboled the frigates , seeming almost to skim the whitecaps . Face into the wind the surgeon took his farewell of England . The movement , the sensation of flight , and the foamed wake pointing backwards to land , gave to him a sudden release . He was saying farewellnot only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . He was freed . For thirty-three years he had been imprisoned in John Hunter . Now he was no one . The sun blazed on that point of the arc of heaven which men call noon . If his nausea grew severely active , he was not alone in his suffering . In the noisome cockpit he rocked hourly in his hammock . Too weak to do more than stagger to mess , he watched the veteran surgeonscheerfully bang their biscuits on the board to dislodge the weevils , then looked down on the oozings from the salt pork on his plate , recalling vividly certain jelly-like collections that had gathcredin pools on the dissection tables , and rose to hasten again to his hammock . There he lay retching weakly , his brain seeming to lurch in his head from ear to ear.  |p220No  light drifted down the cockpit hatch , the darkness being shatteredinto grotesque moving patterns by the swaying lanterns hung infrequently from the sweating beams . The deck was covered with a slime that collected as it rolled down the bulkheads , and the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapping their heads above . The area was not big enough to swing a cat in , someone complained a dozen times a day . Even those loblolly boys and ' prentices who had been flogged managed a hollow laugh at this , for it was an old jest which , like the taste of the cat , never lost its flavor through repetition . He urged himself to take to the quarter-deck and the salt air . He began to notice the ship more , and then wondered when he had become so used to the monotonous creaking , hour on hour , that he no longer heard it . At night , under the April sky , he sat on a coil of line , half dozing , and watching the masts swing about among the stars . Bone-thin from his nausea , a weary man on his way to war , he was strangely at peace . In the middle hours of the night of April 7 , the rugged outline of an island of rock appeared ahead . Far to the larboard the frigate Escort hovered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . Faintly , then clearly ringing over the water came the cries of identification as more sails , insubstantial as mist , gathered against the night : What ship 's that ? And the answer , coming downwind , The King 's . The one who hailed first greeted the newcomer , Unanimity ! Came the reply , His Glory ! With a shudder the Britannia submitted to the anchor . There now glowed high on her foremast and main four steady lights . In the distancemore lights appeared , nodding . Belle Isle lay directly to the south , the expedition arriving to menace her dropping anchor in her Great Roads . Hulking afar in the dark , the island looked impregnable ; it seemed to rise like a walled castle straight from the floor of the sea . On the quarter-deck , a presentiment curdled the scanty contents of John 's stomach . This was going to be a very small , very unimpor-P221tant , and very bloody little engagement . Gazing at the black jagged rise that was Belle Isle , his armpits began to exude in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighth did the entire convoy arrive at the rendezvous , and by that time several matters had come to pass . Six frigates had been dispatched to patrol the French coast to the east , and the assault had been set for the following morning . On the transportsthe flatboats were hoisted up , ready to receive the regiments and marines at a moment 's warning . Those regiments assigned to the first and second assault waves would take their surgeons with them . In the cockpits of the men-of-war and the frigates the naval surgeons readied their operating theaters by shoving sea-chests together to form tables . The regiments crowded to the rails to gaze on the escarpments of Belle Isle . Who , except legions of the Devil , could be expected to scale them under fire ? Then the word passed among them that Point Lomaria , the southmost tip of the island , was fortified with four guns . The young soldiers who had not seen action before , fiddled about with their cartouche boxes , and when they opened their stiff mouths to speak , saliva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault would be made on Port Andro , a spot just north of Point Lomaria , but the marines were to make a feint north of Andro to draw the French fire . The fleet would assist the land forces to the fullest , covering them with an umbrella of fire whilst they were in the flatboats . The Achilles was assigned to silence the battery atop Point Lomaria . By nightfall on the morrow , the land forces and the marines would be snug on land with an extra ration of rum for their troubles . That night , in the hammocks , foot to head , foot to head , lads of fifteen and sixteen lay awake , rocking gently , staring into the dark . I n the wavering light of the cockpit lanterns John checked his surgeon'schest , testing the edges of his scalpels , the bite of his amputatingsaw . His ivory-handled lancet lay to one side . A fellow regimental surgeon indicated it . " A handsome lancet , Mr. Hunter . " John extended it to him instantly . " Would you care to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone of colorless decorum . Not by word or glance would he ever take issue with any of them . Nor with anyone else , for that matter . He was but a simple surgeon , no more . The drums rolled them out of their hammocks and on deck before the stars in the west had gone out . Cursing , sweating in the chill , the men stumbled up the hatchways to receive the order to descend ship . They waited . The morning was gray , the water rough . Belle Isle , rising to the starboard , appeared deserted . It was full morning before they were ordered into the flatboats . The wind had at last shifted so that the men-of-war might repair to their stations . The convoy began to move , the flatboats herded among the ships like chicks . Then , takingthe wind in full sail , the Dragon and the Achilles broke formationto take the lead toward the bay . Abruptly the Achilles fired on the French battery , shattering the bleak morning into  --  birds . The land forces , tossing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Birds , thousands of them , crying and shrieking , swarmed from the cliffs to darken the sky . Again the Achilles fired and the birds swooped and circled , protestingthe violation of their rookery . The month was April and the nests were laden with eggs . The boom of the French reply was almostlost in the screaming of the birds , and the land forces looked doubtfully at the cliffs awaiting them . Now the Sandwich moved into line to make her attempt on the French . Heeling greatly , she fired and the French replied , sending an enfilade past the ears of the land forces . One of the men in a flatboat gazed out bitterly on the Sandwichand remarked , " God , she ca n't even put her thirty-four poundersinto action ! Look at her ! " It was true , the Sandwich was nearly impotent , her heeling carrying her so deeply into the water at each sway that the ports for her most powerful guns were inundated . Hampered , she fired her eighteen- and twelve-pounders ; and the Valiant , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join the action . Of a sudden the French were silent . At once the signal was hoisted on the Valiant 's main topgallant for the regiments to land . The land forces were uneasy ; it might be a ruse on the part of the French . Still , the Erskine grenadiers and the marines rode with forti/tude toward the escarpments . Those in the flatboats following strained to see how they would fare in their disembarkment . Then the French fired again . The Valiant was hit . Helpless in the flatboats , the land forces looked back to the embattledmen-of-war , and ahead to the marines and Erskines , small as insects as they struggled to scale the escarpments . Man after man drifted from the cliffs to the narrow sandbar at their base . Distant , minute , unreal , the land forces watched them , watched their decimationas they might the destruction of a hill of ants . Belatedly the Temeraire opened fire , and the French reply this time hit the Valiant again and also the Aetna . Then the first drops of rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the birds had disappeared but for a few lost ones wheeling and crying out their panic . A handful of grenadiers had gained the top of the escarpment and , tiny silhouettes against the gray sky , took a brief stand , before they too tumbled leisurely downwardsto fall just at the edge of the sandbar . Those land forces close to shore saw the water lap and recede over the stilled bodies of the fallen . The rain began to come down steadily . The French pounded at the men-of-war resolutely , batteries all along the cliffs opening fire . The Valiant , mainmast splintered , careeneddangerously as she attempted to retreat out of range . The Vesuvius was pelted , and the Sandwich , still wallowing in the heavy seas , was suddenly taken aback . The signal went up from the Temeraire for the flatboats to desist , and making the turn , the land forces realized how strongly the winds had risen . A wave washed over a flatboat , overturning it , and the rest of the land forces clung wildly to their seats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the face of the escarpment , still fell one after the other . Ahead of them , the men-of-war , the frigates , the fire ships and bomb ketches were battling not the French but the sea . Another flatboat overturned , all in it disappearing . The French trained their fire on the land forces and then grew silent . Against the cliff a solitary figure plummeted through the driving rain to the sandbar . Then there was no more activity at all on the island . The next waves blocked ships , island , and everything but the sky from view . The flatboats sought succor from the ships nearest them . One , containing fewer than twenty of its original sixty Loudons , managedp224to reach the Valiant . Those still clinging to the boat were halfdrownedby the waves which had washed over them . Taken from the sea they were left in heaps among the rigging , sail , and shards of mast and yards on the deck . A pooping wave swept over the Valiant , battering her and taking with it sailors , rescued , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water pouring from his nose crawled toward a hatch . He was a surgeon and he would be wanted below . In the cockpit the wounded and dying were stacked like cords of wood , awaiting the attention of the surgeons . The surgeons themselvesclung to the sea chests with one hand and attempted to ministerto the wounded with the other . Loblolly boys swayed at their sides with lanterns which flickered now on the bulkheads , now on the beams , while the surgeons sawed and hacked and cauterized in the flitting shadows . The screams of the wounded were lost in the roaringand pounding of the great thirty-four-pound guns overhead as their trucks strained and crashed against the ropes holding them . Clinging to the hatch ladder other loblolly boys passed the wounded down into the cockpit , and the dying upwards to be cast overboard . The squat surgeon descending looked briefly at a man with his chest ripped open and nodded as the dying man was passed up to his death in the sea . The deck offered no purchase for his feet as he struggled across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dangling arm was slammed onto a chest before the surgeon , and he bellowed for an amputating saw . Without thinking , automatically , of necessity , he seared the stump with the cautery , then smeared on the tar . The next man was slammed on the chest , and ripping the soaked breeches from him , the surgeon probed deep with bullet forceps and fingers into the groin , searching for the ball or splinter embedded there . To a third whose intestines bubbled from him , he cried only , " Overboard ! " and did not even look after him as the wretch , conscious and screaming for mercy , was handed on to those at the ladder . From a fourth he removed the entire jaw , his knowledgeable hands seeking and finding the spurting vessels his straining eyes could not see . Overhead a gun broke loose from its ropes to thunder across the deck crashing into the bulkheads . The loblolly boys shrilled in terror while the surgeons paled and cursed and went on with their butchery . Before the gun was secured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , it did not come down on them first . 7'hcp225feet , the hands , the arms , and the legs began to pile up around the sea chests ; all were too busy to remove them . The seamen felled by the charging gun were being handed down now . The gale spent itself , the sea calmed . The loose gun was captured , but the surgeons were still at work on those who had been injured in its terrible journey athwartships . There was little that could be done for them , they were crushed , mashed . John Hunter turned away from his patient to vomit up sea water , and then shook his head to clear it . A cry floated down the hatchway and the loblolly boys took it up . " The Dutchman 's breeches , lads ! The Dutchman 's breeches ! " The first patch of blue sky breaking through the overcast had been sighted . And the Valiant was still afloat . A flatboat came to take him back to the Britannia . In the cockpit he discovered his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him casually , as one of them . " Understand you had quite a time of it on the Valiant . " " Aye . " " One can not understand how the navy gentlemen can bear it . Will you play a hand , Hunter ? " He joined them diffidently . He had forgotten how to be polite . A surgeon attached to the Beauclerks said contritely , smiting himself on the forehead , " Hunter , forgive me , but to this moment I had forgot ! I neglected to return it to you when you were arranging your chest . . . . " The lancet William had given him , and which he had thought at the bottom of the sea , was laid in his hand. ivThe expedition lay in the Great Roads awaiting reinforcements and making repairs . Atop their natural citadel the French cavalry appeared to taunt the English , riding back and forth along the ridge , their coats bright dots against the April skies . Just out of range of the French guns , the English alternately sulked and laid fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they nowp226had to consider . The escarpments were , for one thing , more treacherousthan they had realized . The guano of the birds , accumulated on the rocks , had made them slippery as ice in places . For another , a force trying to scale the cliffs had to be too occupied with its footing to be able to return fire . If a successful ascent were to be made , the French would have to be completely diverted . The leaders of the expedition took to boats to scour every nook and bay and jutting point , searching for the weaknesses of the natural redoubt . From the Great Roads the English could look directly on their objective , which was the Citadel of Palais fronting the sea . Once the Citadel fell , the tiny island was lost . Still , a direct assault upon it would be catastrophic . Separated from the small town of Palais by an inlet of the sea , the Citadel lay within hornworks and ditches , and was connected to the town by one narrow bridge . To the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formidable beauty . And St. Croix , who commanded it , was known to the veterans as a generalwho did not surrender easily ; it was said of him that if he or a single man under him still drew breath , he would not consider the tide of battle to have turned against him . The morale of the English was low as they rocked uneasily day after day , squinting over at the Citadel , remembering the havoc of their rout . And cramped as they were on the stinking transports , no sight so irked the land forces as that of St. Croix 's cavalry briskly taking the April air . Then news spread through the ranks which somewhat cheered the land forces . Reinforcements had arrived , among them the 16th Light Dragoons , commanded by Gentleman Johnny Burgoyne . The older , more established regiments , proud as they were of their colors and history , grew wistful at the thought of the 16th Light Horse , now in its third year of existence . Gentleman Johnny was a man to whom legend naturally attached itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named him Gentleman Johnny , because Burgoyne preferred the French " point of honor " system of discipline to the English punishmentsystem , variously imposed in the form of clubbing , drubbing , riding the wooden horse , tying a man 's heels and neck together , or running the gauntlet or gantlope . The land forces crowded to the rails to watch the reinforcements , under the convoy of the Windsor , sail into the Great Roads . Then ,  |p227the  cheering and the hailing dying , they once more returned to their contemplation of the Citadel . By the twenty-first of April the English had completed their plans for a second attempt on Belle Isle . The serene little bay of Locmaria , curving at the base of great rock formations , was thought to be unfortified . IJnfortified , because the rocks seemed to the French to be impassable . Here it was that the English determined the first debarkment of grenadiers . As before , there would be concurrent attempts to draw the French fire to other landing points , while the men-of-war would engage as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , close under the stern of the Achilles for protection . At the first volley the birds of Belle Isle again darkened the sky like a storm cloud passing overhead . But after their passing , the sea sparkled and the rising sun penetrated the water to clear green depths . In his flatboat John Hunter noted that no fish were to be seen at all , and wondered if the concussion of the guns had driven them to the bottom . He found himself being rowed into battle , toward his possible death , debating a question of utmost philosophical import : Can fish hear ? The spanking wind died somewhat as they approached the shoreline , but the water grew choppier , so that John , seated aft , had much the sensation of riding a fractious horse . Beside him , the instruments in his chest bumped noisily . And so the red coats skimmed across the water toward battle as jauntily as if they were on a pleasure excursionon the Thames . The rocks of Belle Isle took on a pink glow as the sun climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned their heads at the singing of its passage . Another came past , and then several splashed into the water just ahead of them . The Loudons clutched their muskets and watched the glinting spray thrown up by the balls hesitate for an instant in the air , then , turning over like a wave , fall in a shower of fluid emeralds back to the sea . The French on the cliffs corrected their aim and fired again . A Loudon in the bow of the tatboat sat upright , his musket still in place between his knees , andp228his head gone from his shoulders . Those nearest him scrambled to toss the spurting body into the sea . His bright coat contrasted delightfullywith the intense green of the water , his blood staining the surfacewith veins of gold . Everywhere the Loudons looked , this tangy morning , their eyes feasted on beauty . However , after they had been on the water for almost an hour , some of the men began to complain of their eyes , the reflections of the water were so brilliant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sails of the Sandwich , the Dragon , and the Prince of Orange were almost blinding . They were close to their debarking point when they espied the Beauclerks in the distance , skimming along under the overhang of the rocks of Locmaria . The Loudons watched as much in curiosity as anxiety as the Beauclerks beached and began to debark . The French had not discovered them , and with admirable precision the grenadiersmarched in ranks over the narrow beach to the rocks . Only as they began their ascent did they disperse , searching for crags and handholds . Miraculously , a handful appeared at the summit , running north . A puff of cannon smoke obscured their fate as the French took notice of them ; and as each red dot topped the rocks it disappeared into the gathering cloud . Just beyond the breakers the marines were hastening to reinforce the Beauclerks , with the Burgoynes pushing behind them . Now the remainder of the forces were diverted from their appointed rendezvousto join the fray . The flatboats tumbled on one another so rapidlywere they beaching and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English stormed it with more than mere resolution  --  withabandon . The entire land force now converged on the spot , while above a breach appeared in the smoke . The French had given ground , retreating from their guns into the interior of the island . This time the English had refused to be pushed back into the sea . Before dusk , all the land forces were ashore , while the advancewaves had pushed almost three miles into the interior in pursuit ofthe French . The rest were preparing to follow before night came on . The surgeons wandered about looking for work to occupy theirhands , for only thirty men had been lost , and the wounded had notbeen more than triple that number . Long since , the severely injuredhad been dispatched back to the sick berths of the ships , and thep229walking wounded were now bandaged and wanting nothing so much as their suppers . Many had suffered lacerated hands from the rocks , but the surgeons themselves were among that number . At the top of the cliff John Hunter stood looking northeast towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to roost , loudly protesting , and he grimaced at the memory of the difficulties their guano had presented while clinging to the rocks . Beyond the beach the sea at sunset was molten gold , and so smooth that the menof-waranchored far out seemed fastened on it rather than afloat . Their masts were stark black against the crucible of the Great Roads . Turning , he looked on the island lying within its escarpments as a series of moors interrupted by streams and verdant valleys . Far in the distance stood the Citadel wherein the French would have retrenched . And like the men-of-war lying in the Roads in prey of it , the Citadel rose from a sea of gold , too beautiful for the tongue to tell or almost for the eyes to bear . The marching lines formed , and John Hunter fell in at the rear of his column . The night wind was balmy , moving without sound over the fresh new grasses of the moors . The English rested on their arms that night , making their march to Palais on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruined bridges , they passed batteries which had been blown up , but they saw no sign of the French , only the record of their passing . Occasionally they saw a farm or a tiny community clustered on the hank of a stream , but they saw no living thing that was not wild ; cattle , swine , fowl , and horses , all gone , and only manure and wallows to show where they had been . By midday the faces of the men were almost as red as their coats from sunburn and the heat of their exertions . Belle Isle was the way one imagined the tropics to be , and indeedsome of the veterans declared it so . After being at sea for almost a month , the land forces were enraptured with the island , and when the columns stopped to rest many of the men actually pulled up handfuls of grass and sucked and chewed on them . They laughed at themselves , but for all that , they had the strangest desire to graze on the tender greenery like cows . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannon of the Citadel , the columns came to a halt . Here they would await their reinforcements and provisions . The French did not disturb them inp230any way . But those sent forward to spy reported that St. Croix was busily availing himself of the English silence to raise more redoubts to fortify the town and Citadel . The English , tethered by the delay of the reinforcements , moved about camp restlessly , trampling everything green into the earth , so that after several days they had raised a dust to hover in the warm sunshine and coat their throats with every breath . Details were sent out to collect straw for bedding and for strewing around the tents to keep out rain . Others were set to digging a series of great privy trenches , into which straw would be thrown once a week for sanitary purposes . In only a day or so these trenches grew exceedingly foul , and the men had to fight their way through an enfiladeof flies to reach the edges . Near this spot the hospital staff was ordered to set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Among the hospital surgeons was John Hunter , newly reassigned from the Loudons . Now the difference between the regimental and the hospital surgeonsbecame apparent . The regimentals were answerable to a supriorofficer who was not a colleague but a fighting man . The hospitalsurgeons were answerable to a Mr. Young  --  this much was known . What was unknown was the ranking order of a Mr. Lorrimer , a Mr. Farquhar , a Mr. Hunter , and the ' pothecarial gentlemen . With true surgical spirit the gentlemen set out to wrangle with one another  --  with the exception of the stolid , silent Mr. Hunter . It so happened , during that lull in which the English waited for their reinforcements , that a Panmure eased himself outside his tent rather than repair to the privy trenches . He was ordered to run the gantlope , and was then cast down , unconscious , next the privy trenches which he had avoided . The hospital surgeons were mortifiedto discover that Mr. Hunter had gravely caused the Panmure to be carried into one of the hospital tents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one member of the staff , went in search of Mr. Hunter . He found him cleaning the excreta from the Panmure 's lacerated back . Mr. Lorrimer gasped . " Tut , Mr. Hunter , " he began , " surely a ' prentice should be doing that for you ! " Then remembering his original purpose , he added , " In truth , it should not be done at all ! That man does not belong in the hospital . "  | " He is injured , " John said mildly . " You are interfering with discipline , " Mr. Lorrimer explained . John paused in his ministrations to the Panmure . " I must own that I am unacquainted with the right in these matters , " he said . " So newly am I attached to the hospital staff . Mayhap I should have consultedyou . " In the shadowy tent Mr. Lorrimer bent forward hastily to peer intently at John . Convinced of John 's sincerity , Mr. Lorrimer was touched . " My dear Hunter , " he cried , " do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ! " Mr. Hunter rose and executed a clumsy bow . Mr. Lorrimer unbent in a graceful reply . Mr. Lorrimer then turning to leave the tent , John resumed his tending of the Panmure . Mr. Lorrimer was most kind to John thereafter ; it was obvious that that gentleman considered John to be simple . Concurrent with the arrival of the reinforcements and the first assault on Palais , Mr. Young , nominal head of the hospital staff , found himself similarly besieged . With the inflow of the wounded into the tents , the gentlemen attempted to give orders to one another ; and in a moment of blind abandon , Mr. Farquhar actually requested of Mr. Young , " Pray , sir , would you tend this man , I have another who is hemorrhaging and requires my attention at once . " Yet so deep was Mr. Young 's incertitude in his own powers , that he could only mutter some testy retort before turning away . In the new surgeon , Mr. Hunter , Mr. Young thought he might find his only ally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halls , making diligent use of the cautery , further mutilating torn flesh with the bullet forceps , and industriously enlarging with his scalpel every wound which came under his care to permit the " mortified materialpassage to the surface . " So exactly was he following those preceptsof military surgery which Mr. Young had laid down for him , that Mr. Young was constrained to say : " Ah , Mr. Hunter , were only the rest of the gentlemen like your-self ! " " Most kind , " John replied expressionlessly , at the same time startinga copious bleeding of an unconscious man . Mr. Young nodded his approval . The perfect surgeon , his smile was saying . The perfect subordinate.  |p232The  buzzing of the flies in the tent nearly drowned out the rumble of the French mortars . As the English moved forward , the regimental surgeons went also to treat the wounded on the field . In the main , they moved about in the trenches and redoubts stopping hemorrhages and lopping off dangling members . More delicate and demanding work such as probing for balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flying hospital . Mr. Young insisted ( and all the gentlemen agreed with him on this ) that all balls be removed and the wounds enlarged . Wounds caused by the complete passage of a ball should be enlarged at both ends of the tunnel so as to facilitate the formation of pus . Only in the matter of copious bleeding did the gentlemen differ . And while the wounded lay in the tents screaming , and the mortars shook the earth , the gentlemen jarled loudly over the dying , unable to reach an agreement on whether fourteen or sixteen ounces should be taken off at the first blooding of a man with a ball in his skull . Daily the English moved forward , driving the French from redoubtto redoubt , surrounding the town of Palais . From the Great Roads the men-of-war pounded at the Citadel . The English closing in on the town went forward apace , leaving their dead in the fields behind them where the birds of Belle Isle discovered them . When the details sent out from the flying hospitals came upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genitals , and carried away shreds of the torn uniforms to weave into new nests . At one of the flying hospitals , Mr. Young looked on these dead and remarked , " Oh dear , they look as if anatomists have been at them , " and John Hunter , within earshot , did not so much as blink . During their press toward the Citadel the English captured a French whore in a French cavalry uniform . She was friendly , thirsty , and bilingual . The message was carried back to the flying hospitals : Prepare to move forward into Palais . St. Croix 's little secret was out . Those cavalry officers who had so plagued the English in the transports , had been but whores and peasants dressed in red coats and mounted on the farm horses and cows of Belle Isle . The English took the town that night.  |p233Mr  . Young 's gentlemen sallied forth through the ruins of Palais to seek housing for their hospital . The little stone chapel , though it had a great hole in the ceiling near the altar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the wounded , now febrile with their inflammations , gazed up at the Stations of the Cross painted and peeling on the walls , and a blue-and-gilt Virgin miraculously intact upon her pedestal . In the search for a suitable place for the hospital , John Hunter , separated from his colleagues , came upon four wounded French soldiers hiding in a deserted house . They had been there for four days . All had received wounds from balls . One had taken two balls in the thigh , one of which had gone through , the other being still lodged . The second man had been shot through the joint of the knee , the ball having passed through . The third had received a ball in the arm at a moment when the arm had been extended horizontally , so that the ball had entered at the inside of the insertion of the deltoid muscle , and finally come to lodge between the basis of the scapula and the spinal process . The fourth had a ball in his chest , and was spitting blood occasionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indications of the dried blood on his clothing and beard . John saw at once that the French soldiers had given each other succor only to the extent of binding their wounds to stop the flow of blood . They watched John silently as he went from one to the next examining the wounds . Not even the man with the chest wound was febrile ; on the contrary , he made motions with his hands placed to his mouth to indicate that he was hungry . His wound was healing by the first intention , the suppuration was slight . None of the wounds , most certainly , had been enlarged to permit the exit of necrotic tissueand pus . Of the two men still carrying balls , only the one with the ball lodged near the spinal process showed any great mortification . The man with the ball in his thigh was cheerful ; under the rag tied about his hip his two wounds were healing by the first intention , and he seemed not to have undergone any inflammation whatsoever . Apprehensive as they may have been while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more at ease . Some aspect of the little English surgeon with the fiery brows and the direct gaze , other than the strange figure he cut , gave them thought . He stood among them , his colorless eyes fastening for long moments on each man . Slowly the great jaw slid forward ; John had come to a decision . As at a signal the Frenchmen began to jabber at him excitedly , but John merely turned on his heel and left them . He went back to the chapel and ordered that the wounded French be brought to him there , should the chapel be the site chosen for the hospital . It was then that the French thirty-two-pounders resumed their play on the advancing English . Under the eyes of the Virgin , John removed the ball from the mortifying shoulder of the wounded prisoner . The man lay quietly under his hands . His gaze , black with pain and the effort to still his outcries , met John 's . The ball removed , the wound must now be dilated with great deep strokes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes went from John 's face to the handle of his scalpel protruding from his pocket . A sound escaped from his white sliver of a mouth , a thin suppressed whimper . Then he closed his eyes , waiting . In that moment , there in a chapel filled with sun and agony and the thunder of siege and the groans of a soldier dying on the altar , John Hunter knew that he was damned . He had sought refuge , a hiding place , in conformity and a red uniform . But that passion to seek and discover for himself , with little interest and no concern for what the rest of the entire world might think , had at last found him out . He was no longer the dim Mr. Hunter hovering in the shade of the testy Mr. Young , he was John Hunter again . God help me , he thought . . . . He began to bandage the mortified shoulder gently . The Frenchmansighed deeply and opened his eyes on the Virgin . " Ave Maria . . . " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , continued on with the prayer.  |p235He  dressed the wounds of the other three French prisoners , and sent them to the prisoners ' tents . Mr. Young indeed had his troubles . With the permanent establishmentof the hospital in the chapel , a Dr. Blyth had arrived on the scene to take charge . Being as uncertain as Mr. Young in his ability to maintain authority , Dr. Blyth was equally opinionated , and as given to lapsing into a pet when opposed . After his first humiliating passage at arms with Dr. Blyth , Mr. Young sought out the humble Mr. Hunter to salve his wounds . He found him in one of the prisoners ' tents , bending over a wounded man . " Well , Mr. Hunter , " Mr. Young said , making a commendable effortto sound composed and genial both , " when do you intend to remove the ball from that man 's chest ? Not that , " he added hastily , " I 'm pressing you . Merely curious , you understand . " " Never , " John said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . " Oh , dear me , " Mr. Young said , sounding pleased in spite of himself . Here was his chance to assert some authority . " I must inform you , sir , that we treat our prisoners with the same compassion allotted to our own men . " " No quarter , eh ? " John said . Mr. Young stared , struggling to surmount his amazement . " Sir , I sin afraid you mis " Not at all , " John said levelly . " I understand you perfectly , Mr. Young . " " Then see that you do ! " Mr. Young said , off on a tangent and Into a pet in the same instant . He bit his lips fiercely , but before he turned to stalk away , John had seen the tears of chagrin start to hisAs if he had understood every word of the exchange , the French prisoner began to laugh . " Silence , you turd , " John snapped . But the prisoner continued laughing , confident that John had the day . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mfr mortars night and day . The wounded English poured into thep236several hospitals , while a steady stream of those no longer fit for fighting , the amputees , the skull fractures , and the rest , were sent to the ships to languish in the dark , humid cockpits . The constant mortar fire seemed to those in the chapel to pound and shatter the bright June days into fragments and scatter them out of all relation to each other . To John it was noon at one moment and dusk the next , with tapers and lanterns throwing shadows among the arches and giving movement to the Stations of the Cross . Yet he found the strength to forgo a few of his brief moments of sleep in order to slip out to the prisoners ' tents to the four men under his care . The lives of these men had become more precious to him than his own . They were that which he had never conceived of before  --  living preparations . And each of them , by virtue of the site and conditionof his wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surgery which John had ever formulated : Assist Nature . He knew now that inflammation was an indication of an additional hurt to the body , and that the formation of pus was not to be applauded , but dreaded . So far he had gone . And at that , he thought wryly , it is more than enough to brand me as a complete heretic . He bled each of them lightly and freshly dressed their wounds . His four preparations were as grave as he , sensing that in some way this grotesque little Englishman had fought for their lives , for strange reasons of his own . From the chapel nearby , they listened to the screams of dying Englishmen , as the English surgeons finished off what the French had only begun . Still the siege of the Citadel continued , but breaches were made and great damage done before they were closed . Now the wounded came in hemorrhaging copiously from bayonet wounds , as well as balls and fragments . John applied his new principle , developing it by trial and error as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he must dig out a ball he preferred the use of his fingertips to the snapping , tearing chops of the forceps . Wherever he thought it feasible he allowed a ball to remain . Occasionally , after an inflammationhad gone off , and a lodged ball threatened future discomfort , he went after it from another direction , making a single incision which would heal more easily than a torn and enlarged wound.  |p237He  began to tabulate wounds in columns in his mind . The velocityof the ball as opposed to the damage it inflicted . The differences in wounds caused by the penetration of the ball and its exit . The conclusions to be drawn from the appearance of blood in the urine occupied him . He was in constant search for the cause of that mysteriouscold sweat and coma that came on insidiously and killed those who had not been injured in a vital part , who had not hemorrhaged excessively , and who should not have died . One such had died within a few hours of Mr. Young 's having ripped a great scab from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pus would begin to dissolve the hip bone were the crater not swabbed out . Then the body , like the Citadel , could withstand only so much punishment , even though a vital part were not involved ? He pondered . One by one the hospital surgeons recognized that there was somethingpassing strange about John Hunter . He knew they were whispering , and once he grinned to himself : Gods , how they would shout were they to discover what he had done to a certain patient , hidden behind a pillar of the chapel . He had had the sliver of bone , taken from an amputated hand , clean and dry in his pocket . He had surreptitiously weighed the sliver on the ' pothecary 's scales . The wound of the patient ( also in the buttock , and enormously enlarged by the industrious scalpel of Mr. Young ) was in full suppuration . John had waved a ' prentice away from the man saying , " There , lad , I 'll dress this man myself . " Before applying the fresh dressings he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wound . At the end of a week he was to weigh the sliver and know that pus no more dissolved bone than did the blood itself . But before then , several other matters had come to pass . On the eighth of June , St. Croix surrendered , and Belle Isle was at last in the hands of the English . In the fervor of the final assault , a marine , Lieutenant Colonel Mackenzie , received a shattered arm . Brought to the chapel , he fell to John , who carefully removed the arm , scorning the cautery , and ligaturing laboriously as he went . To Dr. Blyth 's disgust , and Mr.p238Young 's horror , John then dissected out the muscles to form the flaps for the stump as carefully and with as calm a precision as if he were back in William 's dissection room . Fortunately Lieutenant Colonel Mackenzie had long since fainted . The inflammation came on almost at once , bringing with it fever and agony . John refused to purge him , ordering a ' prentice to cool him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laudanum . That night one would almost have thought Dr. Blyth and Mr. Young to begrudge the young Lieutenant Colonel his laudanuminducedsleep . Those wounded who had received the cautery lay awake groaning and crying out in the voices of hurt children , for not even laudanum could douse the fire of the charred flesh . The entire staff , with the exception of John , immediately predictedthat the Lieutenant Colonel would die . After the news of the fall of the Citadel had become tiresome , the surgeons returned to their own war . John supposed the regimentalsurgeons would next be treated to a recital of his misdeeds . When Mackenzie 's suppuration came on , its scantiness was a disgrace . The poisons he had taken from the wound were still distributedthrough his body , Mr. Young said . Yet the glance exchanged between Mr. Farquhar and Mr. Lorrimer told John that these two gentlemenwere aware that Mackenzie was cool , his fever gone off . Moreover , the young Lieutenant Colonel was restless , he wanted solid food and he wanted to rise from his bed . John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear he will take an infection from the stench of the others ' wounds ? " Mr. Lorrimer inquired . " I do not believe in that , sir , " John said . " Still , I would have him out of the chapel . " In a friendly voice Mr. Lorrimer said , " I have been a military surgeonfor many years , Mr. Hunter , and I believe it . Why , pray , are you then so anxious to remove him from the chapel ? " " I do not know , sir . " Mr. Lorrimer smiled . " I honor you for saying that , sir , " he said , though whether in sarcasm or sincerity John could not say . " I take it I have been insufferable these last weeks ? " John chal-lengedHe regretted his lapse into his former brusqueness at once . Forp239he discerned as soon as the words were out , belatedly , that Mr. Lorrimerhad tentatively extended his friendship , and was even now withdrawing it and packing himself and his dignity off to a safe distance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the answer to that question , " Mr. Lorrimer was murmuring coldly , " elsewhere , sir . " So it was that Mackenzie left the chapel to rejoin his regiment , his praises of Mr. Hunter , the surgeon , loud on his lips . The cautery cases were still out of their heads with the fevers of their blistered , seared wounds . Most of them died . After an exchange of prisoners and the signing of the preliminary articles of capitulation , St. Croix was ready to march from his Citadel . Yet he must make a parade of it , with flying colors and saluting cannon . Out from the Citadel came the garrison , the women marchingbeside the men , on their way to the French ships waiting to removethem to France . Standing in the door of the chapel with his fellow surgeons , John watched the gaunt French march along smartly . The dashing St. Croix seemed not to know that his men were in tatters , and himself vanquished . One of the marching French , catching sight of John , waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . John grinned and waved back . " Was he not the bone of contention between us , Mr. Hunter ? " Mr. Young asked playfully , all willingness to overlook and forgive and conduct himself like a benevolent god in general . " Aye , Mr. Young , " John said , conscious of the intensified gaze of his fellows . " Most certainly , " Mr. Young said generously , " one would not think him ever to have had a ball in his chest . " " And most certainly , " John was borrowing Mr. Young 's tune , " one would not think he carried it yet . " Mr. Young saw no reason why he should not laugh at this , no reason at all . He forced a titter . " Ah , we are all witty and light/headed this day , Mr. Hunter ! But you dour Scotch can outdo us all . " " My thanks , " John said , meaning several things , which Mr. Young , frowning , began to sort out . With the French evacuated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palais grew humdrum . Those garrisoned on Belle Isle sought for diversion and found little . There were a few French harlots remaining ; of the townspeople the English saw only the men going about their tasks . In the strange subtropical summer of Belle Isle the men grew listless , the English never being too inclinedtowards rapine at any time . Conversely , matters were at a fever pitch in the hospital . The gentlemenstood about among the arches of the chapel staring down at John 's patients . Mr. Lorrimer and Mr. Farquhar , who seemed to John to share but one personality between them , each day revised their count of those of John 's patients who might still be carrying balls . Mr. Young announced aloud that a search should be made , much as if stolen articles were in question . To this Dr. Blyth , seizing an opportunity to appear lofty , remarked , " Oh come , Mr. Young . . . Pray , how do you propose to conduct such a search ? " John surmised that Dr. Blyth welcomed discord among the surgeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept his own counsel , doing as he pleased . Having watched for a number of years a certain Dr. William Hunter in action , this present fray was something less than a minor irritation to him. xiA Burgoyne had received a stab wound behind the left breast , dealt by a small sword . When he had been brought into the chapel he was bleeding profusely from the mouth . It appeared that the lungs were considerably injured , for the situation of the external wound excluded the possibility of the stomach 's having been involved . The Burgoyne had fallen into John 's hands just at the end of the siege of the Citadel . Thinking the man to be dying , John had merely bled him to slow the pulse and to offset the violence of the inflammation . Yet the man was still alive.  |p241Mr  . Young , on the prowl , examined him minutely , as he had taken to examining all John 's patients . John stood aside , unconsciouslytaking that stance he had once assumed while bending over a particularly backward student in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his straggling brows in question . Mr. Young parried with a question of his own . " What do you propose , Mr. Hunter ? " Not inclined to fence when a man 's life was at point , John turned away slightly so that the patient might not hear . " I suspect he is in extremity , and yet I confess  --  I do not know what to do for him . " Mr. Young said , so quickly that John knew he considered himself to have been deferred to , " Well , we can not do everything , can we ? Just continue on with him as you have , there 's a good fellow , and he may survive yet . " " Aye , and he may die . " " As to that , we all may . Eh , Hunter ? " John gazed at his superior steadily . The man was not fighting over principles , surgical or otherwise , he was merely defending a somewhathazy concept of his own exalted position . On that point , John cared little if Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rolled all into one . I see , John was saying to himself , that I have but to defer to this turd , to do anything I wish on this island . " Yes , we may all die , at that , Mr. Young . " " Hee , " Mr. Young said . " You Scotch . . . Hee . . . . " Still , the patient lay on his back unable to breathe properly , lay behind them dying . John studied the Burgoyne attentively . He recalled that since his entrance into the hospital the patient had sweated excessively . His legs were beginning to swell . John stood gazing at him , listening to the labored breathing . Yet he had not hemorrhaged from the mouth since his inflammation had  --  Good God , was he hemorrhaging internally ? There was the explanation . The chest was full of extravasatedblood , and as the internal bleeding continued , the accumulatingpool of blood began to compress the lung . He will drown in his own juice , John thought . No , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer expand his lungs . He went in search of Mr. Young . " Oh no , my dear Hunter , " Mr. Young remonstrated , " I could notp242consider it . You have no proof . It is an interesting supposition , granted . But I  --  " " I should not like to proceed contrary to your wishes , " John said evenly . Mr. Young , who had compensated for his many years in uniform by garnering a complete wardrobe of fancy facial expressions , now assumed a smile intended to be engaging . " Of course you would n't , sir . But  --  ah  --  since the man is a Burgoyne , why do we not consult Mr. Home on the matter ? Now that the regimental surgeons are no longer busy in the field , it would be a courtesy on our part to  --  " " And this Mr. Home is the Burgoyne regimental ? " " Oh , yes . And a most accommodating gentle The conversation was growing tedious , if not irksome . " Then let us send for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Scotchman somewhere in his early forties , had developed that trick ( but whether consciously or no , John could not decide ) of speaking in so soft a voice that one strained to hear his every word lest one miss something of importance . In manner he stood exactly between gravity and irony . Yet John , mistaking him at first for a malleable person , set out at once to have his way . Mr. Home heard him out without interruption . " Thus , " John said in conclusion , " I wish to open the chest . In short , to perform the operation for the empyema . " Mr. Home asked in his quiet voice , " You are certain , sir , that the collection in his chest is blood , rather than pus ? " " Aye . " " Your pardon , Mr. Hunter , but I can not quite understand the necessity for removing the extravasated blood , even should it be collectingin the thorax . In the lungs  --  that would be a different matter .... " Still  --  at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood from the wound . " " But it appears that only one lung is affected , sir . Men have survivedwith the use of only one  --  " John grew a trifle exasperated . " The extravasated blood will soon put pressure on both lungs ! Furthermore , the blood may irritate and produce more inflammation . Gods , can you not  --  Sir , I should like to perform the operation at once , and  --  "  | " Pray , not so precipitate ! " Mr. Home begged in his soft voice , but he smiled to show he meant no offense . His mouth remained closed when he smiled , giving him a gentle demeanor . " Let us first see what a spermaceti mixture and a little opium might accomplish for him . I am loath , to be perfectly frank , to expose him to the rigors of such an operation as you suggest at this time . " Again he smiled with lips as close as those of a wound , and John thought : He has poor teeth he wishes to hide . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And when will you consider the possibility of the operation  --  when he is moribund ? " " When it becomes apparent to me , sir , that his thorax is filling with blood . You will pardon me , but I must now tell you that I no longer consider this man your patient . I will come to tend him myself . Certainit is that I can do for him only what I feel is right . I pray that I shall not make too serious a mistake . " Mr. Home bowed . " Yet , let me assure you , sir , that your opinion on the matter is most persuasive , and I shall think on it at length . I have heard somewhat of your progress and am most impressed . Before leaving with his regiment , Colonel Mackenzie had many fine  --  " " Blawfum , " John said coarsely . " Let us hew to the point . " Home looked on John with unconcealed pity . " There is no point , Mr. Hunter . " He did not raise his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am most distressed by this clash  --  " John , balked , overriden , more positive than ever that a chance to advance surgery had been forfeited , could only turn away in his anger . In the day or so to follow he returned again and again to the Burgoyne . Slowly the man 's lips began to turn blue . Home gravely decreasedthe dosage of laudanum . " You could , at least , " John muttered , " put him out of his pain . " Home , choosing to take the remark as an honest suggestion , shook his head . " I fear it would bind his chest too much . I have noticed that opium has that effect in asthmas . " He seemed unoffended at having to explain his actions to John . Always in the background was the hovering Mr. Young , waiting to see . He wore the same old soiled expression  --  incertitude  --  for three full days in a row . Mr. Farquhar and Mr. Lorrimer somehow managed to be within earshot frequently.  |p244The  Burgoyne died shortly after Home had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young made the discovery . " Where may I find Home at this hour ? " John said . " Mr. Home ? Why , I suppose with his regi Surely , you 're not going to search him out ! I feel myself quite competent to pronounce a man dead  --  " " Aye , you 've done it enough , I 'll wager , " John said . But his anger was for Home ; he did not intend to daily , expending it on Mr. Young . He found Home sitting outside a tent treating a Burgoyne for the itch . Without preamble , John said , " Mr. Home , I wish to perform a morbid dissection on the Burgoyne who died this afternoon of a plethora of extravasated blood in his chest . May I have your permission . " He was already turning away when Home said : " One moment , Mr. Hunter ! I would speak with you . " Taller than John , and less clumsy , Home nevertheless had some difficulty in matching the pace of John 's short legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so abruptly that Home almost stumbled against him . " Mr. Hunter , I must protest that your conduct to me before a private was personally embarrassing . " " Oh , speak up , " John said rudely , " these damned birds make such a row I can not hear a word you 're saying . " Home refused to raise his voice and stepped backwards out of the sun to the shade of a tree . His beard , growing rapidly in the heat , suddenly stood out on his face as a gray stubble . In the strange black shade that the trees of Belle Isle cast , Home 's gaze was peculiarly penetrating , commanding . " It is not our custom to anatomize the dead , Mr. Hunter . They gave their lives for their country , you know . " " Also , morbid dissection would bring to light too many mistakes , eh , Home ? " " Perhaps . However , I would not care to place my refusal on that head . " " And I believe it to rest on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me prove you wrong , is that it ? " " At least , " Home remarked , " you do not insult my intelligence by mere insinuations . You accuse openly . " " That dead Burgoyne accuses you , not I. I challenge you to watchp245me dissect him . I challenge you to the sight of the extravasation you said did not exist . I challenge you to spare me a few moments of your most valuable time  --  " " Such passion , " Home observed , " on such a hot day . Collect yourself , Mr. Hunter , you leave me no choice but to permit you your dissection . Shall we go ? " He had not once raised his voice during the entire exchange . Inside the shattered house that John had selected for his private morgue , the corpse lay on a table swelling rapidly in the heat . Home exhaled a low whistling breath and removed his coat . " It is more like the West Indies than the coast of France , " he observed in a friendly tone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . " He stood waiting politely for John to proceed . Angrily , John plunged in , making a deep incision from throat to navel . Exposing the sternum and ribs , he raised the sternum and cut into the cavity of the thorax . Blood poured out . John looked directly at Home . " Does that take you by surprise ? " " Yes , " Home admitted slowly , " I must own that I had not thought it to be so . " John grunted , far from appeased , and began sponging and moppingout the cavity . When he turned to his pile of rags for a fresh handful , Home began where he had left off . The cavity no longer obscured , they paused to observe the site . " Then the lungs , " Home said in his soft voice , " were not punctured after all . . . . I let him die of suffocation . " " He would have died during the operation , " John heard himself saying . " Yet it should have been performed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They walked through the quiet street of Belle Isle together , enyingthe coolness of the approaching dusk . " I had heard that you re an anatomist with your brother in London before joining the my , " Home was saying . " Hmm , " John admitted with reserve . " In all truth , Mr. Hunter , it is only today that I have recognized the value of anatomy to the surgeon . Anatomy had always seemed ' me an end in itself . And now , after all my years of practice , Ip246suddenly see it as the foundation upon which all surgery must rest . " He looked away from John , his color rising under the gray stubble on his cheeks . " I suppose that must sound very strange to you . . . . " " No , " John said , " not too strange . It is more than a matter of a moment 's thought to see that the two are the same thing . Or that the one exists only for the other . " Gaze still averted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been but half a surgeon . " " For years , " John said , " I was but half an anatomist , my dear Home . " For the first time , Home exhibited his decaying teeth in a broad smile . " We are well met , my dear Hunter . . . . Tell me , are you a married man ? " " What ? I thought you asked me if I  --  " " So I did . You are not married , are you , Hunter ? " " No . " When the inhabitants of Belle Isle had crept back into their homes , the animals of the island miraculously reappeared also . Of a suddenstray dogs lay in the street asleep , while cats stalked the birds in branches overhead . Pigs broke out of sties to run squealing among the tents ; and when the sun 's rays lay directly across the land and the ocean was mutable green and gold , cowbells drifted faintly from the moors . Those remaining in the chapel lay in torpor , staring at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole in the ceiling . One by one the regiments were departing for further action in the war . The garrison stood half-empty , and the French girls began to appear outside the houses at their tasks . The French did not merely tolerate the English ; they pretended they were not there at all . Up and down the coast , the peasantry grew accustomed to a pair of Englishmen who climbed about the cliffs , or sat for hours on an escarpment gazing out to sea . " I 'll be leaving soon , I suspect , " Robert Home said on one such afternoon , and John looked away to hide his dismay . " But then , Jock , so will you . I do not believe they will leave many of the hospital staff for the few troops remaining . "  | " In that case I hope to go home . " " Ah . . . Who does not ? " They sat in pensive silence , looking down on the sandbar which had been covered , not so long ago , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip of their wine bottle . " Look , " Home said , " how the sea changes color . . . " " I am weary of this place , " John said suddenly . " I long for a cold , disageeable London drizzle . " " God help us both , then . There has been talk of an expedition to Martinico . " " Martinico ? Where in the middle of nowhere is that ? " " I believe , " Home said in his quiet way , " you have located it correctly . " " Why there , I wonder ? Robbie , did you ever happen to hear what was the concern of this war ? " But Home laughed ; he had a question of his own . " Jock , why did you join the army ? " " I was tired of war , " John said promptly . Home was hurt . " Pray forgive me . I was prying . " " I was at war with my brother . " " I see , " Home said carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch of the consumption . " " Ah , yes . . . " " And then there was the matter of myself and a great many bottles of wine . My brother Wullie  --  Dr. William Hunter  --  and I had sonic little differences over those bottles of wine  --  " " Jock , forgive me for  --  " " Do n't concern yourself . It does n't concern me . . . overmuch . . . My brother and I are very unlike , Robbie . He is most elegant and fashionable and clever and ambitious . I was not able to keep puce with him . " " Dr. William Hunter sounds like a colossus among men , " Home commented dryly . " Ah , he is ! Mark me , he will be the richest and most important ysician in London one day . " John could not resist adding , " I think m to have Court influence even , Robbie . " " Then perhaps he might use it to have you sent back to England . " John felt his mouth harden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to burden him with  --  Bygar ! Why should I not ? I shall write him at once . Robbie , I am an ass . . . " " Indeed . Tell me , did you say whether or not he is married ? " " Wullie ? Ha ! No , he is a single man . " Briefly William replied to John 's letter . He could not prevail upon Mr. Adair to arrange for John to be sent home . However , there was a good chance he could remain on Belle Isle , if that was John 's second choice . Young Hewson would not be coming on to London that fall as the School was to remain closed . William had an enormous practice to attend to these days . He signed himself , as John had , Your most affectionate brother . As an afterthought he added that their sister was pregnant . If the child was a boy she planned to name it Matthew . William 's letter served only to strengthen John 's sense of exile , and with it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . Grumpy , idle , fretful with the heat , John sought the company of Robert Home . He found the regimental surgeon under a tree sewing a button on his coat . Home 's fingers moved awkwardly , because , like most of the Burgoynes , he had an exasperating case of the itch . " Come , give me your coat , Robbie , " John said . " I 'll do that . " Home watched him with some amusement as John set himself about the task . " You sew a fine seam , Jock . Reminds me of my  --  " " If I 'm to be a damned surgeon for the rest of my days , I should at least know how to sew , " John said testily . " Robbie , you regimentalsdisgust me with your lackadaisical ways . " " Pray , do n't be so cappernishious . We regimentals do n't look on every patient as being some kind of preparation , you know . Get the lips of the wound pressed together is our only concern . We leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ever saw in my life , in fact , is done  --  " " Aye , and your scars look like sacks drawn together with a draw-string . " " They manage to keep the organs in and the cold air out , " Home said composedly . " Ah , now I 'll look the proper fop again ! Thank you . " Home started to fold his coat , and then with an expression John had never seen on his face before , laid it instead across his knees . " I just happened to put a miniature or two in my pocketsp149when last I changed coats , " he said . ( Was his gaze really somewhat crafty , John wondered , or did he merely imagine it so ? ) " My daughterAnne , " Home said . He handed a miniature to John . The girl was blue-eyed like her father and the majority of English or Scotch girls . She had a mouth in the proper position under a slightly pointed nose . Her hair was the color hair usually is . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She sings very prettily , " Home said . John scratched the back of his neck  --  damn the heat  --  and announced , " I ca n't abide a screeching woman . " As if he had not heard , Home was taking out a second miniature . " Agnes . She plays the harpsichord . " She had blue eyes , she had features , she had hair . She was in blue . " Tinkly things , are n't they , " John said . " Why will women bang at them ? " " Now , Mary , " Home said  --  he apparently had an inexhaustible supply of daughters , John thought , irritated at the banal turn the conversation had taken , and the heat and his boredom and idleness  --  " embroiders . Very beautiful work , Jock . " " At least she does n't make any noise while she 's about it , " John observed tactlessly . He took a turn for the coarse . " Robbie , were n't you man enough to seed a boy ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digging into the archives of his progeny . " This was done when he was not quite three , he 's five now . That 's my Everard , Jock . Did ever you see such a fine lad ? He 's the sum of all my existence , my Everard . " " Then do n't make a surgeon out of him , " John advised ; and at last found the graciousness to add , " for he appears too fine a boy for such drudgery . " Home beamed , careless of his black teeth . " Mayhap he 'll be a physician . He 's a sharp lad , Jock . Why , at the age of only nine months he  --  " John longed for an opportune moment to change the subject . He was doomed a moment later to hear that Home had seven children . It promised to be a long afternoon.  |p250With  a brisk drumming to quicken their steps , and with standard snapping in the salt breeze , the Burgoynes were marching down to the flatboats . At their head was Gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saddened to see him go . At the foot of the column , Robert Home , out of step , slouched along on his long legs , scratching at his itch . Beside him , his ' prentice carried Home 's old surgical chest , bound with a bloodied old strap . Home was the last man to enter the last flatboat , and as it pulled away from the quay , his soft voice drifted back to John with extraordinaryclarity , " . . . rendezvous in London , Jock . . . . " When September came on , the hospital surgeons fell into a new argument . Mr. Young and a Mr. Gordon disagreed over medications . A private had applied for a potion to solidify his bowels ; he had had to seek out the fly-infested privy trenches a dozen times a day . Mr. Young advised clarified butter . Mr. Gordon , suddenly proclaiminghimself an expert on the putrid fever , said bleeding only was necessary . Then Dr. Blyth was appealed to , but not before Mr. Farquhar and Mr. Lorrimer had had their first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was nothing in the world he so detested as wrangling surgeons . Yet he had it in him to be one of the worst , when it came to that . There had been nothing admirable in his brushes with Mr. Young . And in his first meeting with Home , he had addressed that gentleman in the tone he might have used on a pert ' prentice . " Oh , damme , " he cried aloud to the sea and the bland skies , " will I ever get home to London ? " He found himself thinking : If he were , by some stroke of luck , sent home shortly , and if he showed himself to be sobered and matured by his war experience , would WilliamBut in his next letter , William clearly indicated that he would not . He advised John to save his money against the end of the war . Then , on half-pay and given the freedom to practice surgery by virtue of his service to the King , he might set himself up quite nicely in Lon/don . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorotheawas coming to term , John would be delighted to know . Be damned to the brat , John thought , in a pet . Through September the sun burned on , and in the chapel the surgeonsclawed at one another with their voices . A second soldier had applied to have his stool solidified . And a third , and a fourth .. . . Then overnight all quarreling ceased . The surgeons were too occupied . The bloody flux had at last taken hold of the garrison . Men lay amidst the buzzing flies and the stench of the privy trenches where they had fallen . Word came in that the brigades quartered around the island were affected also . The surgeons conferred , and , for once , agreed . When the putrid fever settled down on a confined population such as that on Belle Isle , there was the not-unheard-of possibility that none would leave it alive . John read in each face an alarm that not even the worst of the siege had roused . Mr. Young was quite shrill , and there was open fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island to Saucon and attend the sick there , and someone would have to go to La Maria , and someone . . . In all , there were fourteen hospitals in operation by mid-October . By that time , a chill steady rain began to fall . The dead were left stacked outside the hospitals in the mud awaiting burial ; but no one had the strength or time to dig . Inside , under leaking roofs , the dyinglay sodden and at the same time racked with fever and dehydration . They lay in their constant evacuations of water and blood , until someone noticed that they were stiff and had them thrown out to join their fellows in the mud . The French locked themselves away in their houses , abandoning their wells , and leaving out pans in which to catch the rain . The English saw them no more . The hospital staff succumbed , the physical gentlemen collapsing over their patients . An apothecary died , and Mr. Lorrimer was near death and out of his head with fever . Mr. Young endeavored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Blyth rode on a stumbling nag in the rain , going from hospital to hospital , sounding the cry of the infallible cure for the flux , " Clarifiedbutter , gentlemen , two spoonfuls at a time of clar " Shortly after , he fell from the horse , not to rise under his own power . John climbed into the saddle in his place , and set out.  |p252He  had forgotten when he last slept through a night , or even removed his soggy uniform . Yet the flux did not visit him . His morbificseeds were not so inclined , he decided . His ailments seemed always to be those of the spirit ; and always chronic . When October ended and November drearily rained in , the numberof new cases lessened . By the end of the month the epidemic was over . The toll had been greater than the entire loss suffered from the assault and capture of beautiful , tranquil , healthful Belle Isle . After that , winter closed in , and the hospital staff languished , still too battered to do more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received a slight promotion . He was purveyor of the hospital stores , and was thus accorded a slight raise in pay . As William had advised him , he began to save his money . When he was not concerned with the clerkly details of his duties , he was engrossed with the hibernating lizards of the island . He found them out and warmed them and poked chunks of meat down them and prodded them into activity . The lizards preferred to sleep forever , rather than not at all , and died . He made a few careless notes . But he had propounded another principle of surgery : Artificial stimulation did not necessarily strengthen the constitution . Thus , drugs which brought on the warm hands and the flush of health , might only serve to diminish those powers needed in the battle against disease . And wound inflammation was a disease , of that he was certain . He would no longer administer stimulants , then , to future patients battling inflammations . " Why , Mr. Hunter , " Mr. Young wanted to know snippily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you waste your time on those slimy creatures ? " " I have no choice , " John said , boldly pretending to misunderstand . " They 're all staff surgeons same as you and me , Mr. Young . " Mr. Young was still sorting through his wardrobe of facial expressionswhen John left him . Like a woman with a full closet , Mr. Young found that he had absolutely nothing to wear . Soon after that Mr. Young received his orders to embark . John was hardly sorry to see him go.  |p253The  talk was all of Portugal . John decided he would want the directorship of a hospital were he to be sent there . Such a position would eliminate his having to bicker with a superior over his surgical principles . He began to storm William with letters ; it was April and William must move quickly . His orders came , he and Dr. Blyth were to proceed to Portugal . He was still a staff surgeon . William 's replies were strangely evasive and yet rife with the most astonishing hints . Great matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal them as yet . John had to learn from gossip brought to the island along with the hospital supplies , that Dr. William Hunter was due for an appointment to attend the Queen in her capacity as a child-bearing lady . He grew tense with expectation . As the Royal Accoucheur , William'sinfluence would be scarcely less than mandatory . And , at last , William wrote to say that the Secretary of War had promised John a hospital directorship . He embarked for Lisbon , high of heart . And within the hour he was groaning in his hammock , violently ill . He arrived in Lisbon in midsummer , seeing it first from the ship as it moved up the Taugus River . From a distance the white city , rising in tiers from the river , seemed dreamlike , serene . On the quay , the heat nearly struck him to his knees , and he and Dr. Blyth clung to one another , panting . " Oh dear , " Dr. Blyth was muttering , " oh dear , oh dear . . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll soon be fanned by the breezes of a nice new controversy . " " Pray , Hunter  --  " Dr. Blyth began , and in spite of himself , sniggered . The hospital they found to be a miracle of spaciousness after the chapel and tents of Belle Isle . Entering the cool shadow of the hall they dimly discerned a familiar figure approaching .   " Dr. Blyth ! And my dear Mr. Hunter ! " " Mr. Young , " John said . They bowed . They strolled down a hallway toward a ward . " Not like Belle Isle , is it ? " Mr. Young asked , adorned in his most pleasant expression . " Not yet , " John admitted . " Hee . . . you dour Scotch . . . Hee . . . " God , John thought . Oh God . They went through the ward , their feet scuffling softly through the sawdust . In another hallway , two gentlemen were approaching them , physical men , by the look of them , and hastily Mr. Young murmured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Say nothing if he surprises you  --  Ah , Mr. Madox ! Dr. Huck ! " Mr. Madox , a gentleman with nervous quicksilver eyes , took to looking down on John with great concentration as if he knew somethingfascinating and unbelievable about him . Dr. Huck , a man of extreme reserve , by the brevity of his greeting , also watched him , but rather in the manner of one fearing a scene and hoping somehow to escape before it should occur . Mr. Madox opened fire . " I have heard much of your work , Mr. Hunter . You must tell me of your ideas some time when I am not busy . I 'm readying myself for the position of director here , you know . " So saying , he withdrew a handkerchief from his sleeve and flicked at the air with it , as if to clear the space between himself and John . " I must be going  --  " Dr. Huck murmured . " Strange , " John said , " that there are to be two directors , Mr. Madox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Madox agreed . He did not agree with John in the slightest . " You must be mistaken in your expectations , sir , " he said levelly , but his agitated eyes betrayed him . Having opened fire , he was afraid to stand and fight , and bowing quickly to all assembled , he made his retreat . " Damme  --  " John began . " Oh , do lower your voice , Hunter ! " Mr. Young cried happily . " Gods , " John said , " you know what kind of a man I am , Young . I can not work under such a one as that Madox , I must be put over him ! Otherwise , he will oppose and balk me at every step . "  | " Let me assure you , " Mr. Young announced in ringing tones , " that I am your stanch friend in this matter ! " " And I , " Dr. Blyth chimed . The two gentlemen exchanged a cozy conspiratorial smirk . " To me , " John said wearily , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have mattered little had he managed to receive the post . There was only the most routine surgery to be performed . The English had come to Portugal somewhat in the manner of a big lad rushing to stand over a littler one threatened by a bully . Spain , the bully , then retreated to reconsider the matter in a new light . The most serious wounds John treated were those caused by stilettos , which had been employed to settle differences between the Portuguese and the English soldiers . John persisted in his efforts to obtain the directorship , plaguing William with letters . Yet , he knew he did not really want it , careless of prestige . In August , the Queen was delivered of a Prince , and rather belatedly , the English set out to celebrate . For the first time in many months John became rollicksome drunk and kept Mr. Young up to all hours , pounding him on the back and repeating some mysteriouswitticism about Dr. William Hunter and a pair of rusty forceps . Mr. Young could not make head nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Dr. Hunter had been in attendance at the Queen 's labor . In reply to John 's pale importunings , William sent him an advertisementfor the reopening of the School . Dr. Hewson would assist . John threw the paper to the floor . He remembered that black day when he had discovered Hewson of the downy beard moving among the dissection tables , usurping John 's place . Yet , long before then surgery had marked him for one of its own . It was as if there were a dearth of Mr. Youngs and John Gunnings and the like , in this world , and surgery had resigned itself to the taking of captives for its ends . William 's letter also drifted to the floor . John went out under the white sun to walk the white city , casting before him his shadow of idle discontent . He came to stand at the edge of the town , looking along the road of a great viaduct with arches over two hundred feet high , spanning an empty heaven over which no cloud had everp256seemed to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English cemetery , to walk quietly among the trees , to ponder . He had the feeling of one who , waking from a long illness , must become reacquainted with himself . I am a surgeon , he told himself . What then ? The war could not last forever , and he would be forced to rely on his own resources . I have never done that , he thought , and his vast surprise stayed his feet . From Scotland to William to war , always he had clung to someone or something other than himself . On his ultimate return to London he would have toHe found himself looking down on the grave of Henry Fielding . Crotchety old Fielding who had glowered and bawled like a baited bull at Smollett . Old ? At his death , Fielding had been something like two or three years older than William now was . John 's skin grew cold under the white sun , all light and no warmth . Time was like water , moving rapidly , carrying on its crest all that he had hoped to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued with sufficient diligence ; still , here he stood in a cemetery in a strange land , his hands idle , compounding the waste of his time with petty rivalry over a petty position . Would this damned war never end so that he could return to London , and work ? When he entered the hospital late that afternoon , Mr. Young met him in the hall . " Ah , there you are , Hunter . Robbie Home has been in search of you . " xvii " I have every expectation , " Home was saying , " of being with my family for Christmas . " He rocked on the points of one of the two chairs in John 's quarters . " And I am not ashamed to own that I have long since grown weary of the war . " " Gods , what I would give to be out of it , " John said sourly . Home looked wise . " There is talk . . . Matters will come to an end soon . The soldiers can smell a thing like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of their being mustered out . Pray , fill my glass , will you , Jock ? Ah . . . Pffhah ! D'ye think the Portugeo to have a secret hostility towards us ? The wine they sell would poi/son a  --  Jock , you must promise me , you will come to my house as soon as you are in London ? " " Aye , Robbie , though I will be ancient and wandering by then , and you  --  " " La . . . Give me your promise . " " Very well , I promise . " Home rose . " I must be off . Remember now , Suffolk Street , Pall Mall ! " At the door he paused to add , " And Jock . . . Bring Dr. Hunter with you ! " Mr. Young and John stood together outside a ward . " It has been a most  --  ah  --  instructive experience knowing you , Mr. Hunter . " John gravely returned the sentiment . On an impulse he asked , " Mr. Young , if a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ham  --  what would you do ? " " Do ? Why , I 'd remove the ball and enlarge the wound , " Mr. Young said promptly . " Semper idem , " John said , quoting William , and taking himself by surprise even more than Mr. Young . " Always the same . . . . " Mr. Young was most honored , he bowed deeply . " God willing , we shall meet again , my dear Mr. Hunter . " John murmured , bowing also , " Aye , one never knows what God Will do next . . . . " It was May 1763 . In Portugal the skies would be the color of car cold water . On Belle Isle the wind would be moving across the asses of the moors , passing over the sunlit valleys , and sweeping rds before it as it rushed from the escarpments out to sea . In London a fog was giving way to a disagreeable rain . A dead g floated down the flooded kennel in Great Windmill Street ; and garbage heap at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theof the foot-passengers ' shoes . A child was run down by a cargcin the Haymarket , and at St. George 's Hospital , Caesar Hawwipedhis scalpel on his sleeve and proceeded to relieve ap258woman of a cancerous breast . In Golden Square a red-headed child named Willie Blake stared in terror at the Great Head of God which had suddenly appeared in his window , the rain streaming down the Holy Cheeks . Several streets away , a surgeon 's ' prentice and a quack dentist sat conversing , their topic being the eccentric American , Mr. Franklin , and his philosophy of electricity . In Covent Garden , a young Dr. Hewson sat at a work table laboriously dissecting out a preparation of the lymphatics , or absorbents , as he preferred to call them . In Alsatia , a grave-robber awakened in an alley to screw up his pox-scar of a face as he might have a sponge , to press from his eyes two tears of anger and pain ; he had been stunned and robbed . In the Tower menagerie a dying lion lay on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the thousandth time what had ever happened to the maniac who once would have paid him a handsome sum for the animal . In Pall Mall , a barrister , abed with the sniffles , pulled his nightcap over his ears in a futile effort to drown out the noise from the house next door : " Will she never stop torturing that plinking harpsichord ? " he shrieked . In St. Bartholomew'sHospital , Mr. Percival Pott received yet another insult from a physician , and his hand closed over his sword , as Mr. Pott seriouslyconsidered running the physician through . In Jermyn Street , Dr. William Hunter sat in his library , hard at work on a piece of writing in which the leading characters were variously named Monro , Pott , Smith , and Hunter , and drumming his fingers in a dance of excitement on the arm of his chair . And in the portico of the church in Covent Garden , an army surgeonin a soaked , shabby uniform , with a battered surgeon 's chest at his feet , stood smiling beatifically across at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seven Years War was over.  |p259To  do William justice , John thought , it must be admitted that he received John for dinner with all the ceremony he might have accordedhis Most Favored Patient . The last of Fielding 's vinum pomonae came up from the cellar , and Duncan made of himself a parade of one as he bore in the pheasant on a silver plate . William was as full of petees and as playful as a popinjay , and he had much difficulty keeping his lace free of butter , for he had had Duncan spread it on almost every dish  --  fresh sweet butter , pale as moonlight  --  andmost rare . John had owned that he had emerged from the Seven Years War near famished for butter . " Come , Brother , " William said , at the meal 's conclusion , " you must tell me of your plans . " John toyed with the notion of teasing him for the moment . " Why , as to that , " he began , " I fully expected that we  --  " but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he relented  --  " fully expected , " he took up after a pause , " to practice surgery in the Garden . I have taken rooms in Tavistock Row , you know . By and by I suppose someone will apply for my renowned services . " William breathed as if demonstrating the function for a classful of students . In his visible relief he managed , " Your half-pay will be most welcome also , I wager . " He leaned forward now , careless of his stock and the butter , to peer across the table at John . " You are changed , " he said slowly . " I can not quite discern in what direction . You look the same . " William had suffered the loss of several teeth during John 's abKnee , and as he examined John 's sturdiness his expression grew rather peevish . This but emphasized the fact that his nose had started on its slow journey downwards to his chin . William was not , John observed with pity , preparing to greet the loss of his male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of itself ,  |p260grow  to be one of life 's greatest compensations , John decided a trifle smugly . For the first time in his life he was on the verge of preening as William was saying : " In truth , I have never seen you look better . The war has been good for you . " " Aye ! " John agreed . " Wullie , I have found myself . I am become a surgeon ! " " Ah ? " " I shall continue on with anatomy , certainly , " John went on . " Gods , brother , I am buzzing with plans ! " " You 're planning to teach ? " John grinned . " Would it cause you concern if I did ? " " Of course not , " William said with a studied carelessness . " Hewsonand I have all the students we could possibly accommodate as it  --  " John changed the subject . " How is our sister ? " " Well . " " And Mr. Baillie ? " " He is well , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They too are  --  Are you planning to teach ? " " Why , no , Wullie , " John said calmly . " I am going to secure a position on the staff at St. George 's . Would you refill my glass . . . My thanks . " " You confound me , " William said , though his face had already revealed the fact . " I suppose you will be able to give me no little help in the matter ? " William belatedly wrapped himself in his old hauteur . " If I may be allowed to say so , I could place an apothecary 's donkey on the staff at St. George 's , if I so chose . " " Then extend yourself , " John said easily , " and place me . I need the opportunities of practice the position would afford , and the Lord knows I need the money . " " You are most changed , " William decided . " And yet . . . I cannotsay in exactly what way . " " Think on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It may come to you yet . " William let that pass . The old fires of intrigue were lighting up his features , and further , he seemed to welcome the opportunity to dis/play for John his now enormous influence . " Very well , Jock , St. George 's it is . Shall we attend the next board meeting in tandem ? Eh ? The Hunter brothers ! " He was raising his glass . " The Hunter brothers , " John echoed , then , despite himself , could not resist repeating William 's slip of the tongue , " in tandem ! " Over the rim of his glass William 's gaze was momentarily doubtful . But he had so much to tell John , now that his mind was at rest as to the number of demands John might have planned to make on him , that he drank off his wine , rearranged his lace , elevated his brows elegantly , and opened his mouth . " I . . . " William began importantly . He had quite an aria to sing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jock , publication . As I have always said , it is the only way ! )  --  Smollett had gone off to Italy , but William no longer had any particular need of his talents  --  more important , or less important , really , when you considered the matter for more than the space of a moment , Percival Pott was preparing a second edition of his silly Treatise on Ruptures  --  oh , pardon , petee " Come , Wullie , " John said , " you are teasing yourself more than you are me . What is it you can not bring yourself to tell me before you have brought me to a fever pitch of curiosity ? " William tried to evade him . But William could never control his eyes ; though his voice remained soft , his gaze was almost strident , jarring as a shriek at midnight . John could tell that he was closing in on his subject . William had a Plan . He had the ear of Lord Bute on it , and if all went well " . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You mean to say  --  you mean , you have it in mind to establish a school which could grant degrees in medicine ? Right here in Lon-don ? " " I do ! Physic and surgery , Jock . Anatomy , materia medica , practicalsurgery , midwifery  --  all to be taught in English , no Latin in my school . In short , to train the students to become both physicians and surgeons , at one and the same time ! I like to think of it in my mind as being a medical school . My plan is to present the school to the glory of the Crown , and Lord Bute assures me that I will receive a Royal grant for the land . I will have to build out of my own pocket , of course , but the money does not concern me . Jock , I will emptyp262the halls of Oxford ! Edinburgh will be peopled by shadows , and a few Monros wandering about through the empty  --  " But at the mention of the Monros an old ache possessed John , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long since amputated , and he said hastily , " I think your idea of a medical school the finest thing I have ever heard of in my life . Had there been such a school when I  --  Why , at Oxford I saw . . . saw  --  " he resumed bravely  --  " saw men teaching surgery who had never so much as pared a fingernail or nicked a vein . All theory and no  --  " " Both are wanting , " William interrupted , impatient to take over the conversation again . " And the experimental , Wullie . " William frowned , though he was saying casually enough , " Ah , indeed , the experimental . However . . . that will come later . I would not care to stress that part of it right at the first . " " Certainly not . . . . Wullie , believe me when I tell you that I wish you luck on this matter . I shall be famous yet , by virtue alone of being your brother . " " Oh , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist spoiling his effect by adding  --  " but then , I have maintained for years that I would one day become a great  --  ahh  --  shall we go to the library , brother ? I believe we will be more comfortable there . " " Wullie , one question more : Must you have the endorsement of the Crown for your project ? " " Yes , " William said flatly , " I must . " " Yet such would not affect the school . Only your fame . " " Only my fame , " William agreed . John had anticipated no difficulty in resuming his old life in the Garden , and was surprised to find that he could not adjust , could not feel that he belonged . William , busy with his Plan , said it was only a matter of time . Dr. Hewson , with a fledgling dignity , avowed that the School looked as it should only when John was roaming the parlor , the wine glass of the guest in his hand , looking over his old preparations to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eager company readily , and was impatient with himself when he grew impatient with Hewson 's willingness to defer to him.  |p263Once  he thought he espied Colin Mackenzie coming out of a shop in the Hay Market , but it was someone else . William 's friends , old and new , were a tight gossipy clique , their talk so cluttered with names and events strange to John , that it took William half the night to footnote them , so that John 's interest in them wandered , and soon he too wandered away also . Yet he was strangely reluctant to seek out Robbie Home or his other army colleagues . The fact was , he missed his uniform , and he dreaded showing himself as he was , shabby and out at the elbow . Moreover , he was permitting his hair to grow for comfort 's sake , and his red curls would not , as yet , submit to beargrease . He avoided the coffeehouses of the Garden , and went but once into Tom King 's . He saw no one he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Howison , but the rogues and trulls he accosted merely shrugged , asking : " Who ? " More by accident than any other means , he acquired a patient or two . A gentleman broke his leg almost at John 's front door . A lady in a house near him wished to be blooded . Several blades applied to him , in secrecy , to have him confirm their suspicions that they were suffering with the venereal distemper . That was all . He sat in his cold rooms , jaw thrust out in thought , counting up the days until he and William could present his petition at a board meeting of St. George 's . Even before he had returned to London , it had come to him what it was he wanted to do . He wanted to practice surgery on the many , not the affluent few . And only a hospital could afford him the variety of cases he would need . In his desire to see himself secure on the staff of a hospital , he chose to ignore the manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead he reminded himself of the hospital 's pleasant situation in the open countryside . He thought fondly of the morgue , and of Mr. Middleton 's dreamy lack of opposition to anything the members of the staff might care to do . He very nearly succeeded in forgetting the existence of a certain John Gunning , until , finally attending the board meeting with William , and dressed in a fine suit of his brother 's , he found himself face to face with his old rival . John Hunter bowed , glaring . John Gunning bowed , mouth pursed in a smile of malevolent , clerkly distaste.  |p264Yet  even as Caesar Hawkins was bearing down on Dr. Hunter , windily cordial , and William was honoring Mr. Hawkins with his daintiest leg , William 's eyes were saying to John : Pray , do not waste your time on the likes of that Gunning person ; I , myself , will demolishhim later by the merest flick of a finger . Court yon old fool staring at you , he has power ! Awkward , grinning , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objective , John did as he was bid . Excellent , William 's eyes said , now cozen the imbecile I have on my hook . . . . Unfortunately , the Hunter brothers learned , there was no vacancy available . " And if there were , " John said mumpishly , riding toward the Garden in William 's chariot , " Gunning would be entitled to it . " " Of course he would , " William said . " But that is neither here nor there . The point is , you want it . " " D'ye think I 'll be able to take it from him , when one does arise ? " " No , " William said . " But I might  --  in your behalf . " " I do not deserve your kindness , Brother . " " Tut , " William said . " Are you finding it difficult living on your half-pay ? " " Not at all ! " John lied valiantly . " Still , " William said , " I believe it would be more convenient for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are wearing . I have no particular need of it at the present . In fact , it never really became me . Have you made any interesting preparations lately ? " " In fact , I have . I bought an eel from the fishmonger and  --  " " Oh , eels . . . . " William said . Only after William had dropped him off in Tavistock Row did he admit to himself that he had been hoping for an invitation to dinner . But it turned out that William was going dancing that evening , and he bade John a hasty farewell . Restless , lonely , and still dressed in borrowed finery , John set out to wander under the summer stars . Music spilled from windows opened to the warm night , the open doors of the taverns cast squares of welcome onto the dark streets ; still , he but glanced in and then went on his way . At last , what he sought found him , though it was only a matter of time before he would have come upon it anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown to the ground by a Burgoyne officer making his merry , if somewhat erratic , wayp265down the footwalk . The Burgoyne clutched John contritely , attempting to right him on his feet . Then , holding John closer to the light from a window , he cried , " Are you not Mr. Hunter , the surgeon ? " " Aye . " The Burgoyne beamed , and promptly began to undress himself on the street . Or so it seemed to John . " Gods , man , " John began , edging away , " what are you  --  " " I want you to see my leg . Oh , damme , I ca n't seem to  --  Ah well , all in good time , I can show it to you later . No one would ever guess I carried two balls in it . Why , Mr. Hunter , you 'd be amazed at the interest the ladies have shown in my  --  " " Not at all , " John said hastily . " We are attracting attention , pray let me  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! Why , you that saved my leg , and possibly my life , as Mr. Home himself told me just the other day  --  Indeed no ! " He put an arm about John 's shoulder . " In fact , we 'll let Robbie Home pay for our entertainment ! No need for us to argue the matter , Hunter , when moneybags Home awaits us around the  --  " " I would not think of it , " John heard himself crying largely . " The pleasure must be mine , or I will not join you . " " Then rather than displease you , " the Burgoyne said promptly , " I 'm sure Robbie will agree with you , and let you have your way . Come , Hunter , if you are unsteady , you may lean on me . " John supported the merry Burgoyne as they proceeded on their way . In the busy tavern John saw but one face clearly , and that face one which looked on his , startled , and then broke into a blacksnaggedgrin of welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been all these weeks ? " As John approached , Home digested his borrowed finery and grew waggish . " Ah , engaged with the ladies , you rogue . Well , that I should live to see Jock Hunter swaggering about in velvet , with lace under his chin . That is lace , is it not ? Pray , put your jaw to one side so that I may  --  " " You 're drunk as a lord , " John said comfortably , drawing up a chair . " And this is my brother 's suit , as well you might know . " After a time he discovered that the tavern was one preferred by former army men . In the heat and the noise , amidst coarse laughter and foul talk , he found himself perfectly at home.  |p266Now  he belonged . William was right  --  he had changed , more even , than he had guessed . Sometime during the evening he fuzzily promised on his word of honor to come to Robbie 's the next day for tea . Vanity made him wear his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a stroke of fate . For had he worn the suit William had let him have with the sure understanding that John was to use it only for board meetings , and then what had happened had occurredto William 's suit and not his own shabby  --  In short , that day at tea , John made the acquaintance of the core of all Robbie Home 's existence , none other than young Everard Home , aged seven . They sat around the tea table , John , Robbie , and Mrs. Home , an uncomfortable assembly of three trying to create the merriment of many . The tea table bounced and tried to walk away from them constantly ; young Everard Home was underneath it , playing horsie . Robbie wanted to talk war , his soft voice but an undercurrent in Mrs. Home 's murmurings to her youngest , still hidden from sight . John politely bent his head to Mrs. Home and then Robbie . He could not hear the latter , and the former was the most distracted woman he had ever met . Mrs. Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the filling of John 's cup , or the locking away of the tea in its chest , was piled on those which had occupied her the moment before , so that she seemed but waiting from minute to minute for the final collapse . Her gaze , during conversation , was unwavering so that one knew she was listening inwardly , her mouth murmuring out of habit , " Ah , yes . . . Indeed . . . ? Everard , dear , pray stop . . . . " Defeated , John almost welcomed the emergence of Everard from under the table . He proved to be a pretty child , even if most froward . He roamed from John to his parents , trebling challenges to fisticuffs , examiningminutely John 's coat and the contents of its pockets , wheedlingfor coins , wheedling for sweets , bawling for coins and sweets , and pommeling parents and Uncle John , showing no favoritism in the matter . " Are your other children out ? " John inquired in a near shout.  | " Eh ? " Robbie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girls are shopping for  --  " Young Everard knocked John 's cup from his hand , scalding John 's knee and staining his breeches . Robbie fetched the lad a clout an instant later . Mrs. Home led him screaming from the room . " He 's the bane of my existence , " Home said . " Strange , " John remarked , mopping at his knee , " I had understoodyou to say he was the core of your existence . " " Aye , but then he was hundreds of miles away . " " I must be off , Robbie . Give my thanks to Mrs. Home for me , would  --  " " You must come again , " Home said quickly . " Soon . My wife was quite taken with you , I assure you . " " Was she ? " John said . Up to that moment he was not sure Mrs. Home had been aware of his existence at all . And as he descended the steps to the street , Mrs. Home suddenly put her faded blond head out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's exact words for John to return . Somehow , he was too busy to come again to Robbie 's house , what with board meetings at the hospital , and his few new preparations , and his fewer patients . Instead he met Home at the tavern in Golden Square . By autumn he had to admit to Home that he was troubled . He would grow old waiting for a vacancy to come up on the hospital staff . He must find some patients elsewhere . Home too was dour . " Jock , you know the old saying , You ca n't earn enough for bread from surgery until you 're too toothless to eat it . ' But with Pott and Hawkins and Adair and Bromfield all practicing , we smaller beer stand no chance . We 'll have to outlive them , Jock . " " Damn , " John said . " Damn . . . Robbie , I must have work ! " " If you mean you want patients to experiment on , I can see that there might be some dearth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't fling up your head at me in that manner , I have seen you at work before . " " Aye , and I remember teaching you a bit of surgery , Robert Home ! " " Let us say you posed a nice theory to me , and apparently hap/pened to be right . But , Jock , you must confess to being precipitate when it comes to rushing your theories into practice . And were I ever to send you a patient or two , the good Lord Himself only knows what you  --  " John was still a sentence or so behind , nagging the point . " Aye , but until I test a theory , I shall never know whether it lies in truth or error . " " These are patients we are discussing . Human beings . " " And it is human beings who will profit when I am right . " Home flushed in anger . " Look you  --  " he began in soft indignation  --  " d'yerealize what you 've just said ? Who are you to dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  " " You innovators ! God knows whether you are the more careless of others , or the more confident . Well , without your sort we would all still be swine-gelders , I suppose . . . I see that I must send you a patient or two if I am able . My appointment book is at home . Have you had your supper ? " " Oh , I hardly think Mrs. Home would  --  " " She 'll be delighted ! " Ah well , little Everard again . But the younger children of Home 's brood were not in evidence . As if posing for an artist , Mrs. Home and her three eldest daughters were in the parlor , all in attitudes . Coming upon the scene of the maiden at the harpsichord , her sister singing away at her side , and the third demurely seated at her embroidery frame , John was never more conscious of his frayed linen and dilapidated shoes . It escaped his notice completely , as it had before , that the Home parlor was as shabby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heard their high sweet voices , and dreaded lest they start giggling , and he be the cause of it . Mrs. Home said , as if this were all too much for her , " My daughters : Mary , Agnes , and my eldest  --  Anne . " " Miss Home ! " He made a leg . " Miss Home  --  " a leg  --  " and Miss  --  " Anne , she was called . He made the most elegant leg of his life . A little taller than he , she inclined her head to him , and for a momenta pale curl nested in the shadowy depression created by thatp269portion of the clavicle between the areas of attachment of the deltoideusand trapezius muscles . John was enchanted , his fingers half rose to dip into that dark pool . He met her gaze . He watched her struggle to conceal her revulsion ; she was not unkind . How pretty she is , John thought in the midst of his hurt , and then , as she turned away he saw that her nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or misery . He thought her too vulnerable even for a girl of only twenty. " . . . and writes exquisite poetry ! " Home was saying in the tone of one ticking off a list on his fingers . Ah , so that was it . " And , " Home added in a low aside , as the girl moved away , " she fancies herself in love . " " Oh no , " Mrs. Home said positively , " that was last week , Rob-bie . " After supper , Home took John to his study . " Well , will you have her , Jock ? " " Which one ? " " Annie , my oldest . Must marry her off first , you know . " " With the greatest of pleasure , " John said politely . Home sighed . " They are a man 's worst problem , Jock . I have to find good husbands for my girls  --  established men . And yet , even while I am combing the town and half the army for young surgeons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting their caps for them . Annie , now . . . For a month she sighed about the house for a blade who  --  you may believe this or no  --  wore a patch on his face just to the left of his dainty little mouth . He was killed in a duel not long ago , thank  --  Well , I should not say that , eh ? " " I am sure so pretty a girl can have her pick of  --  " John began , when a nasal singing drifted back from the parlor . " Gods , do they do that often ? " " Music and such are supposed to be accomplishments , " Home said severely . " How old is the one who embroiders ? " " You 'll have to wait for her for several years . " Home settled himself in his chair more comfortably . " But in the meantime you can build your practice . You 've made a fine choice , Jock , she 's the leastp270extravagant of the lot . Her name is Mary . It might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I will try , " John said gravely . " She is the plump one , is she not ? " True to his word , Home sent him a few patients . They were not of the best , querulous , poor , and often hopelessly ill . They all lived at the edges of town . Several times he walked over to Jermyn Street to have the use of William 's chariot to get to his calls . And when he finally managed to take in a few fees , he bought himself , not a horse , but a hyena from a menagerie keeper in Piccadilly . He knew himself to be drifting ; he was dispirited . Whereas William was never more assured , pomposities crowding one another from his seamed mouth . " Patience , Jock ! There is certainto be a vacancy at the hospital in a year or so  --  " " Wullie , I need some patients ! And I can hardly let Robbie Home continue sharing his practice with me ! " " Oh , certainly not , Jock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss the Home family with you . " " They are most anxious to meet you . " " I 'm sure they are . Nobodies are usually anxious to meet anyone they can . However  --  " William raised an imperial hand as John opened his mouth  --  " I am equally certain that they are good , honest people , for all that . It is merely that you can undo all my work with the hospital board if you are seen too constantly in the company of  --  " " Wullie , I will not let you  --  " " Please yourself ! " With a great show of unconcern , William began to speak of other matters  --  his proposed Memorial School , to be exact . Lord Bute had said it was only a matter of time until the Crown decided which parcel of land William would be granted . " And had you given me leave to speak further , " William said , drawingto a dignified conclusion , " I would have told you that I am endeavoringto send you a patient or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to await the arrival of his new practice in droves . In trickles , then . . . It came not at all . Robert Home broached a solution of sorts , one evening in the Golden Square tavern . " Jock , there is a dentist right near here who might put you in the way of  --  "  | " Gods , am I now to associate with a quack ! " " I think you might like him , " Home said cautiously . " He is a good man . Scotch , like ourselves . Why do I not take you to meet him ? " " Robbie , tell me the truth . He approached you to share patients with him , and you refused him . Is that it ? " Home met his gaze straight on . " Aye , Jock . " " But beggars can not be choosers . " " I do not consider you a beggar . It is my sincere hope that you will marry one of my daughters . I want to see you have your chance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw still outthrust , Home altered his attack . " Moreover , this dentist , this Andrew Spence , tells me he has a spare room in the back of his house with a good north light . He would have no objections to your using it as a dissection room . And as he buys teeth from a grave-robber , he could put you in the way of some inexpensive subjects . Now , do you want to meet him ? " " Has he many patients ? " " Quite a few . And many have expressed the wish that Spence had a surgeon on the premises to attend to their other wants . " " The venereal distempers , I suppose . " " Aye . Jock , do you want to meet him ? " " Damme , of course I do ; my pride is as flat as my purse . " With a creditable effort John managed a smile and a jest . " When I marry our pretty Mary , I want to be rich enough to keep her plump ! " What William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the swift conclusion that he had no imagination whatsoever . No sooner had he sipped at his wine for courage , and told William of Spence 's offer , than William himself had a counter-offer . William wanted to give him money . " You do n't understand , Wullie . I need money to buy what I need , only if I have the patients to give rise to the need  --  Do you see what I am trying to say ? " " I do not . " John tried again . " I need patients , because each patient will pose a question to me . And to answer those questions I must make preparations  --  thousandsof them  --  " " Are you telling me , " William said slowly , " that you intend top272practice surgery as if it were some sort of a philosophy , or  --  sci-ence ? " " I am saying that I must practice surgery in my own way . " " You will be fancying yourself as a Fellow of the Royal Society next , " William said in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been longing for years to be invited to join . " I know nothing of the Royal Society , Wullie . " To bring the conversation to a close he added formally , " And I thank you again for your generous offer , Brother . But I know that you have most pressingneeds for your money now . " " Damn you ! " William cried . " Jock , damn you and your prig-gish  --  " Bygar , that he had lived to see the day William would call him priggish ! Suppose , in the spring of ' 64 , on a wet afternoon , you had applied to Percival Pott to treat you of a gumboil . That gentleman would have examined you carefully , asked you a certain question so gravely , and with such a quiet concern for your welfare , that you would have answered it in the negative without any heat at all , and thus assured that you did not suffer the Great Pox of the mouth , he would most likely have written down on a slip of paper that a tooth wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Soho Square to have the offending snag removed . With ever so kind a smile , but firmly , Mr. Pott would have you understand that he would not under any circumstances treat you of matters concerning your teeth , and then sent you packing . But you would not have been too distressed , for he would have assured you that , of his kidney , Mr. Spence was of the best to be found . The address itself of Mr. Spence is assuring , for round and about Soho Square are many fine houses wherein dwell the rich and genteel , and even a friend of yours . As you alight from your carriage and hasten towards Spence 's door , you have just time to notice the hand painted on his front window  --  ahand rising from a froth of delicately executed lace ruffles and holding a great tooth aloft twixt forefinger and thumb . Inside , you discover that Spence is a kindly , diffident man in the winter ofp273his days , but in him the season is as mild as those of the Italian clime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gloom of the day , and the barber-blocks about the room are as white as soapsuds can make them , while the blood basins could shine no brighter had they come directly from the scourers . Even in your pain , your eyes take a sudden delight in the teeth exhibited as specimens about the shop , and you choose a strong pearly one as the very tooth to replace the blackened snag you are about to forfeit . You ask , curiously , where Mr. Spence obtains such lovely wares , and he tells you blandly that a " Mr. Howison " supplies them . Mr. Spence then reads Mr. Pott 's note , sent by your hand , and bows you to a comfortable chair . Two sturdy youths with pleasant open faces appear at his bidding , to bow most correctly when Spence introduces them as his sons . One of the lads then drapes your personin a linen bib , while Spence removes his coat and slips over his cuffs a pair of linen keep-cleans . A nerve jangles somewhere deep within you as you guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mouth at Mr. Spence 's courteous request . Somewhat in the manner of one preparing to go down into a well , he peers into your portal . Then , with a motion of so longstandinga habit that he does not need to look behind him , he lifts a shining instrument from the table . At once the two fine lads pinion you to the chair , and you discover with a thrill of horror that they are not fine lads at all , but terrifying fiends with muscles of steel . Your eyes slide out of focus for an instant , and Spence , the archfiend , takes advantage of your faintness to wedge your mouth open with two pieces of cloth-covered wood . Now he thrusts with the instrument , and there is a sound in your skull of bone resisting metal  --  a sound as of the nuts and bolts of your structure being wrenched awry in a mighty earthquake , joists and pillars screeching and grating , and the great arch of the skull itself being torn asunder . Fleetinglyyou know that the sound is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then , before your eyes , black holes appear in the world of reality about you , spreading , and you know that nevermorewill there be light again , for God in His majestic disdain has turned His back on you , and the world was only the reflection of His eyes . You are entering the foyer of Hell . Mercifully you faint , and when you open your eyes again , Mr.p274Spence is wiping your face and urging you over the basin . Your snag now lies on the table , still caught within the vise of the instrument . " . . . Hunter to come out for a moment , " Mr. Spence is murmuringto one of his fine young sons , as he tilts your chin to peer again into the gap in your being he has created . You are numb ; you fancy that the interior of your mouth resembles London Bridge at the time the houses were being removed from it , debris and broken timbers everywhere . Quickly now , Mr. Spence takes up the tooth you had indicated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past your eyes and into the softness of the brain above . You shriek , and your wide straining gaze catches sight of a monster emerging from the hallway . He is squat and orange-haired , his shoulders so broad and upthrusting that they seem to touch the lobes of his ears , filled with orange filaments . His eyes in particular terrorize you , for they are the exact color of rags which have been rinsed out in the Fleet Ditch and hung in the sooty London air to dry . He comes to put his prognathous jaw close to your battered prow , and the hand lifting to force its way into your mouth is covered with a slime whose origin you suspect , your soul reeling at the very thought . His forefinger presses on the tooth Spence has placed in the socket . You faint , briefly dreaming you are pounding this devil into a stain on the granite floor of Hell . When again you recover , you can only push him away as you grope for the basin . You are relieved of your breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to be any number of repasts since forgotten . When you fall back , exhausted , your tongue discovers that your mouth is a web of silk . The new tooth has been tied in place . Now for the first time the horrendous monster addresses you . " If you can bear the pain , sir , a mouthful of brandy swished about would give the parts strength . " He is patently mad . You would not dream of letting brandy enter your wrecked cavern . Yet you do , crying unashamedly at the fire of it . He then gives you another glass to drink from , telling you it containslaudanum and will give you an hour 's rest before you journey home . But just before you drain the glass , Mr. Spence holds a mirror before you , and slowly , painfully , you smile . You are handsome again ! You had forgotten what a winning smile yours really is . . . . When you awaken from your nap , Mr. Spence advises you to ' return in a day or so to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  |p275resolving  never to set eyes on the creature again , and make your escape . Still , you find yourself returning to the tooth-shop . The Hunter person nicks your vein , and pokes about in your mouth . He seems most satisfied with your progress and you let out your breath , though you were not aware of holding it . He callously suggests that you rinse your mouth with brandy again , and produces some . While you are performing the painful task , you idly note that now and again a young man will come in out of the damp day and disappear into the back of the house . Questioning this Hunter creature , you learn that Mr. Spence has an " electrickal " machine in the back . Would you care to see it ? You would , and Mr. Hunter leads you back . You are fascinated with the spitting crackling contraption , though you instinctively hate the shock of its bite . Then , just as you are taking your leave , you spy something on a table in the north room . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now you find yourself on a strange adventure indeed , and for some minutes can not notice aught but the half-dissected animal on the table , and what you can only call the lights and livers and gobbetsof others stored in jars about the room . More objects of internal origin hang from the ceiling , shining with varnish . Mr. Hunter is introducing the other two gentlemen in the room and you bow absently , noting that one is named Jesse Foot , and the other is a Dr. Fordyce , of whom you have heard vaguely . You would question Mr. Hunter about the animal on the table but for the strange actions of Mr. Foot . He does not seat himself after bowing to you ; instead , he attempts to place his person between you and the short Mr. I I unter , and himself addresses a question to that gentleman with a bluntness that verges on the rude . " Sir , do you still deny having read Fallopius ' work on the teeth , even after you have paraphrased his ideas to me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the content which is gibberish to you , but for the manner in which it is uttered . For it seems obvious that Mr. Foot wishes to have all Hunter 's attention for himself , excluding all others . You examine Mr. Foot more closely . You see a long face shaped somewhat like an apothecary 's jar , from which the eyes protrude under nearly lashless lids . It comes to you that Mr. Foot rarely blinks ; it is an uncomfortable thing to behold.  |p276Also  , he has the unspeakable habit of standing too close to one , so that , as in this instance , Mr. Hunter finds it necessary to lean backwardsaway from Mr. Foot . During this while , Mr. Hunter is answeringMr . Foot mildly , " Mr. Foot , you know I am no scholard . I rarely read any book but this  --  " as he waves his hand toward the animal on the table . You glance at Dr. Fordyce , Mr. Hunter 's other companion . But he seems as puzzled as you , both by Mr. Foot 's pressing need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gentle tolerance of such impertinence . Pity , you tell yourself , is at large here . Piqued now , you resolve to satisfy your curiosity over this Mr. Hunter . You put a direct question to him about the contents of the jars ranging the walls . You are somewhat surprised at the length of his answer , somewhatamused too , and somewhat taken by the earnest , gross man . In a rough voice he talks on and on , interrupting himself with oaths , scratching his head , telling you of " preparations " and you know not what else , and searching your face to make certain you understand . He wants very much for you to understand ; he is a sharer . You must depart , and yet are reluctant to take your leave . Then it is , watching a certain fire emanate from the unusually colorless eyes , that you suffer that hiccup of the spirit  --  deja vu  --  as if you have swallowed this experience before . A second later , you know that you are looking at the wastrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , yes , but always you had imaginedhim to be slim like Dr. Hunter , and a touch arrogant , perhaps . But you are drifting from him , and he pulls you back with a quick tug at your curiosity . You peer into the jar he is holding before you . At last you leave , but not before Mr. Hunter has cordially invited you to return any time you wish . Outside , in the dusk of Soho Square , a strange dejection falls on you like the soot from the chimneys . Never before have you known what it is to warm your cold boredom at the fire of another 's obsessive preoccupation with life and its workings . Like the poor hysteric , Mr. Foot , you had been unable to tear yourself away from Hunter 's glow . Climbing into your carriage , you tell yourself that you must regale Lady Di with your experience at the tooth-shop . On your ride to your Gothic house , you are already moving your lips , silently fashioning the structure of your story . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorting among wordsp277you have not used for years , dusting them off to see if any one of them might possibly describe this John Hunter , when , of a sudden , reaching for the next word , you discover you are substituting instead the mental picture of Mr. Spence 's " electrickal " machine . ) Like a homebound ship slipping into its moorings , John had cased into familiarity with the new life he was making for himself . His associate , Spence , proved to be quiet and industrious , devoting the same solemn attention to polishing teeth as to polishing his electrical machine . He made no comment concerning the odors driftingfrom John 's " dissection shop " ( as he would have it , forgetfully ) , as John made none about the crackling and spitting that came from Spence 's hobby room . In a very short space of time John was able to dissect steadily while Spence 's machine rang bells and detonated gunpowder placed in the yard . If Spence was doubtful as to the logical basis underlying John 's admitted intention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholeheartedly enthusiastic over John 's newest passion : the structure and formation and physiology of the teeth . " I should like to make a few preparations of the teeth , " John said . " Perhaps if I could succeed in injecting them , I might prove whether or no the bony part of a tooth is vascular . " He sighed , and hinted strongly , " However , unless I go out for the subjects myself , I do not see how I can afford  --  " " Why , " Mr. Spence interrupted promptly , " I will have my Mr. Howison supply you with whatever you desire when he next comes here . " " Howison ? " " Aye , Mr. Hunter , that is his name . " " A pocked man ? " " Pocked ? Hmmm . . . I do believe he is ! " " If he is the Howison I have in mind , he is all pock , Mr. Spence . " He was the Howison John had in mind . It came to John as the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but once before in his life , and that only during the first few months he had been with William . Now he could let his mindp278roam at will ; he had patients , he had friends , both old and new , and he had prospects . He was only thirty-six , full of the sense of his own powers and his ability to work unendingly , and prepared to live for years . The Hunters were long-lived unless they were carried away by the consumption or the putrid fever or the hundred other diseasesthat reaped a harvest from the city daily . Whereas Jesse Foot firmly expected John to die on the morrow . Foot was never so delighted with himself as when he came to the tooth-shop to tell John of another case of cadaveric poisoning . " I know for a surety , Hunter , that a surgeon in Essex died within four days of cutting his finger at a morbid dissection . What do you say to that ? " " I say , " John said calmly , stepping over Foot 's extended legs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was carried by the absorbents into his constitution where it killed him . " Jesse Foot looked like a horse driven in two directions at once . " Poppycock , " he faltered . " Aye . Mr. Foot , have you no home ? Or do you consider my dissection room your abode ? " " I am a very good friend of Spence 's , I believe , " Foot replied . " I was acquainted with him for several years before you entered into association with him . " " Could it be , Mr. Foot , that you once desired to associate yourself with Spence ? " " It could not ! I happen , sir , to be a surgeon ! " John grinned . " That still does not tell me why you are always in my dissection room . " " I am but idling away a moment or so , waiting for my friend , Mr. Spence . " But Foot was a bit behindhand in the saying of this . " Then stir yourself , Mr. Foot , and be good enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least I find it useful that you are so much taller than I. " Jesse Foot rose immediately to take down the spirits . Then , seizingthe opportunity to approach nearer John , he pushed his face close and demanded , " Admit it ! There are none here but we two  --  are you not secretly taking your ideas from others ? " " Pray , Jesse , sit down , " John said , " you are in my way . And I have no need of secret reading with you to keep me abreast of everything that comes out . "  |p279Foot  sneered , but he reseated himself all the same . Then he sat , watching John , his greenish eyes forgetting to blink . I wonder , John thought , looking sidewise at the thin , elongated face , if he has enough to eat ? The young fool must have even fewer patients than I. . . . For himself he had few worries on that score . He was invited to dine with the Homes with the frequency of a boarder . Each time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home , or a sweet for 1verard to share with the younger members of the family ( which he never did , running off with a sly merriment to devour it himself ) . On occasion too , and because it seemed to please Mrs. Home so , he bandied quips with little Everard , permitting the lad to sauce him outrageously , and struggling the while with the wish to box the brat 's ears until they rang . He expanded in Robbie 's home , much as his feet swelled before the parlor fire . In the wet spring evenings he sat sipping Robbie 's wine , thinking that William would not even have left it out as an Insult to Duncan , and enjoying himself as he argued surgery with Robbie and shouted above Anne at the harpsichord to make himself heard . Once he and Anne had a duet in which Anne insisted that her love was far , far , away , and John , soaring above her , announced that pus and mucus were the same thing . Robert Home gave way to his laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantage of the silence to observe placidly , " This thread will knot so . I wonder that I do not throw it away , " and went on with her work . He watched the girl at supper , allowing his eyes to rove over her plump breast and curved arms . He very much approved of the way the girls had changed their dress after the war . He could remember watching Mr. Pott remove a breast from a woman who was more modestly covered than Mary . Her lips were a trifle thin , though not so compressed as Anne 's , but to compensate , she had a way of widening her eyes and raising her brows when she looked at one , as if in the next moment she was going to say , " Oh ? " on a rising note of pleased interest . Though she never did . I wonder , John asked himself , when they expect me to marry her . Fie considered the matter , munching stolidly with his heavy jaw ; he decided he could grow quite fond of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did , more often than not , it was to put food in it . He approved of that too ; a plump and silent wife would afford him comfort and peace to think , both . He became aware that the Homes were watching him , Anne in particular . Had she asked him a question ? He swallowed and boomed fatuously at Robbie , " And when is Annie going to favor me with a reading of her poetry ? " " Indeed , never ! " Anne cried . " Why , lass . . . " Robbie began reprovingly , but was drowned out by one of Mrs. Home 's most distracted murmurings . Anne burst into tears and abruptly left the table . Mary turned to John  --  Gods , he was thinking , Percival Pott would have blushed to have so exposed her even to surgical students  --  and remarked calmly , " Never mind Anne , Mr. Hunter , she asked for what she got . She was just telling you that true poets never read their poems to anyone . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " She fancies herself in love again . " Mary took another slice of beef . " Her poems are always about love . Some man is always leaving her , she says . Pray have some more of the beef , Mr. Hunter . " " John , " John said fatuously . " Pray have some more of the beef , John . " He discovered that Mrs. Home was not always distracted . They had her full beaming attention . " God knows , Robbie , " John said , " when I 'll be able to support her . I would ask for her this moment if it were n't for that . " Home was thoughtful , his closest approach to calculation . " There is still the matter of your obtaining a situation at St. George 's . Does it seem likely that there will be a vacancy soon ? " " Only if William creates it by some fell deed . We are attending board meetings constantly , and William campaigns for me everywhere he goes . " John smiled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks it to reflect on him . " " I have not yet met your brother , " Home burst out , and looked immediately as if he wished he had not . He went on without waiting for John to reply , " Are the staff of the hospital well paid ? " " Oh  --  adequately . But the surgeons also share in the fees of the students , which makes a quite decent sum at the end of the year . "  | " You would almost be rich ! " " Ha , Robbie ! But I would have enough to maintain a wife and a house , and some to spare for my prep  --  " A thought came to him . " Will Mary have me , d'ye think ? " I Tome said with satisfaction . " She will have the first good man who asks her . She 's the sharp lass of the brood . Now Anne . . . . " John always grew uncomfortable when Home spoke of Anne . Were she his girl , he would grab her by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her . She was not a princess , she was Anne Home , still unmarried at twenty-two , and a burden and a worry to her father . " Does Mary have any other strings to her bow ? " John interrupted . " No . . . No , I think not . " " Then there is no particular hurry . " " None in the least . " One morning when John had opened the windows of his dissection room to admit the sun and the golden sound of the bells of London , the scent of cologne drifted down the hallway , followed by William . A square of sunlight lay on the floor and William stepped into it preciselyand stood smiling about him , while the ancient coin he was twisting in his fingers glinted streaks of light now on a jar , now on John 's nose , and now struck sparks from William 's own blue gaze . He looked on , and did not seem to see , Jesse Foot vibrating quietly to himself in a corner ; he devoted but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see John 's new preparationof a cancerous jaw ; and then he said crisply , harboring his excitement , " A word with you , Brother . Will you excuse me , gentle-men ? " Mr. Middleton was talking seriously of resigning his position at St. George 's before the year was out . William had it from Middleton 's lips himself . " Gods ! " John said . " Now the trick is to snatch the vacancy from Gunning . What about Caesar Hawkins ? " " He is adamant in Gunning 's behalf , " William said , making an effort to contain his joy at the prospect of the battle ahead . " Well ,  |p282we  shall see ! " He eyed John as a general might his troops . " Andthere is now another point in your favor . " " Aye ? " " Yes , Jock . You are being damned in high places . " John stared . " Your work is being talked of ! Surely , you know by now that it matters little what the influential say of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , there are even some who praise you ! I have heard that Horry is telling the most delightful tale about  --  " " Who ? " " Board members are not averse to a pretty story about a candidate . I must own that , as the Queen 's Physician-Extraordinary , I was troubled at first by your being in this  --  this  --  " " Tooth-shop , " John supplied . " Ah  --  thank you . In fact , I feared it might do harm to my plans for the Memorial  --  but on the contrary , Jock , on the contrary . Are those young men in there your students ? " Again John stared . William could take a turn in the road so quickly that John often stumbled past . " Those two men in your dissection room ! " William said impatiently . " Bygar , " John said , " not yet ! " William was amused . " The merest rudiments in the earning of money have always been beyond you , brother . Well , I must be away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a preparation or two I might be able to use in my fall course  --  " " Send Duncan over for anything that takes your fancy , " John said . William tossed his coin in the air and caught it . " Why , my thanks , Brother ! " He returned to his dissection room . He stood in the square of sunlightvacated by William and evaluated the unblinking Jesse Foot . No , he had no money . He turned with a wolfish grin to his other visitor , the young surgeon who had come to see the jaw . " Have you ever performed a human dissection , pray ? " " Why , no , Mr. Hunter , I have not . " " Would you care to ? " Step lightly now , do n't empty his pockets before his very eyes.  | " You 'll pay for the privilege ! " Jesse Foot cried out in warning . Damn him ! " Five pounds , " John said hastily . " And the sum would include the cost of the subject . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Allow me , sir , " the young surgeon said , " to pay you now . " Jesse Foot gave way to his derision . For the first time John bent onhim the gelid gaze of the aroused Hunter . Jesse left in a sulk . " Is Mr. Foot a trifle  --  er  --  mad ? " the young surgeon wanted toknow . " Aye , I think so . Or at least a trifle , as you put it . " " Your pardon , Mr. Hunter , but how did you come to know him ? " " Oh , as to that , " John said , " he was already here when I arrived . " The young surgeon seemed confused . But John was happily occupied with counting his money . A student or so would put money in his pockets until it came time for him to assume his position at St. George 's . Now he could buy more animals , and perhaps even a riband for Mary 's tallow-colored hair . Little Everard had the summer chills . John hardly considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bark and keep him quiet , Robbie . Gods , you are yourself a surgeon , and have already consultedsix more , why call on me ? Most especially when you do not agree with me even on the most basic principles . " " I can not give you a reasonable answer to that , Jock . Except thatone hopes against hope someone like you might perform a miracle . " " Tut , Robbie , the lad has only what they are beginning to callthe mal-aria . The bark will do him nicely . " " You do not consider it to be putrid , then ? " " Gods , no . It is nothing like that . Besides it is all over town . It 's not serious . " " When it 's my lad , it 's serious ! " Home cried . " I tell you , Jock , that boy 's the core of my  --  " " So I 've heard , Robbie . " Little Everard wanted a glass of water . John wandered down top284the parlor in search of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staringout the window at the garden , quill in hand . Mary was out with the other children so that the house would be quiet for Everard . Always ill at ease in the presence of Anne 's tight voice and flutteringhands , John asked awkwardly , " Another poem , Anne ? " " I am writing , " Anne said coldly , " to a very dear friend of mine . Alice Shippen who lives in Virginia in America . " " Shippen ? Is he a physician ? " " I believe Dr. Shippen is a physician , yes . " " Bygar  --  oh , excuse me , Anne  --  he was a student of ours once ! Why , I went to his wedding . " " As did I. " She ventured a laugh , and in doing so revealed that underneath the ice of her manner moved restless incertitude . " It was some time before I remembered where it was I had seen you before , Mr. Hunter . " " Ah , yes . " An uncomfortable silence fell on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he blurted . She returned to staring out at the garden . " A man has his work , " she said faintly , " but a woman has only her marriage . The turning point in her life is her wedding day . From then on she is doomed . " " Doomed ! There being no other possibility , I suppose . " " Only if she loves the man very much . And he has position and money . " " That is romantical , Anne . Life is not a poem , you know . " She turned to him angrily . It came to him that when she was older , her nose would dominate her mouth and war with her eyes . " You think me a fool because I love the beautiful things  --  music and poetryand  --  " " Money , " he supplied . " Aye , money ! I am the oldest of seven , Mr. Hunter , and I am sick of having to share with six others when there was never enough for me alone ! You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am practical . I loathe poverty and scrabbling for pennies and having to share my dresses with my sisters . I want a better life , and I can get it only by marrying it . Indeed I think Mary a fool , I think any girl a fool who does not see the facts as I do . How could  --  " At last Anne faltered and sat silent with shock at her outburst . " How could she even consider my suit , you mean , " John said.  |p285Anne  had no reply . Mortified , desiring to erase , or at least soften , what had passed between them and then escape , John said , " In time you will change your mind , I 'm sure , Anne . " And could have kicked himself savagelyin the backside for his stupidity . " I will never change my mind ! " She was marry very well , you will see ! " " Of that I am certain , " he said politely , only to ruin his effect by adding , without volition , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was as furious as she when he stumped from the room . He did not repeat their passage at arms to anyone , and neither , he discovered some weeks later , and to his amazement , did Anne . Yet he grew angry all over again whenever he thought of it , and resolved to make the formal request for Mary 's hand as soon as he had two more students to his credit . Shamelessly he invited every surgeon and ' prentice he encounteredto come dissect under him . At last several applied , and pocketingtheir money , he went straight to Robbie 's house in Pall Mall . He arrived in the parlor to find Mary cozily drinking tea with a pudgy and unbelievably smug young man named My1ne . The very Mr. Mylne , in fact , who had built the Westminster Bridge . When John at last wearied of the subject of the Westminster Bridge and Mr. Mylne 's great talents , architectural , artistic , and otherwise , he left . The next visit , it was Mr. John Hunter who outstayed Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the fabric , her plump arms showing to best advantage in the candlelight , pink and juicy . " Mary , " he said , " have you ever considered marrying ? " Then he thrust out his jaw , appalled at such an opening , and unable to think of any way to repair it . But Mary was saying calmly , " Why , yes , Mr. Hunter . I 'm planning to marry Robert Mylne . " Thank God ! He went on a splurge , buying every animal that suited his fancy . Again he began to meet Home in the tavern in Golden Square , he was too busy to find time to make his way to Suffolk Street.  | " You are bearing up under your disappointment exceedingly well , " Home said dryly . " Robbie , forgive me . I am in no position to marry anyway . " " That is exactly what my Annie said . " " Aye , that does sound like Anne . " Late in August William 's carriage rolled up grandly before the tooth-shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's loaned finery , with his hair dressed into a solid mat , like a rug , with beargrease . William himself was exquisite in pale blue , and his expression as he surveyed John , clearly stated his conclusion : Well , God knows , it is the best he can do with a face and figure like that . The day just missed being overcast , the sun able to cast only insubstantial fog-colored shadows that disappeared even as one looked at them . Inside the carriage , as they rattled along toward St. George 's , the brothers looked at one another frankly in the gray revealing light . " You are looking well , Wullie . " He was not , he looked as a thin wire felt to the fingers , fragile , attenuated , ready to twang at a breath . " How are the plans for the Memorial coming ? " John went on , and regretted it at once . " Apace , " William said , " apace ! " " I am glad for you . " They swung around a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In that moment , looking down on William 's cheek just beneath his eyes , John saw that what he had thought to be a flush of excitement was actually a sprinkling of fine red powder , carefully blended in . Then William was righting himself , crying out to his coachman , and straightening his pale blue suit . " Your calmness , " he said , giving over his attention to John again , " I find most irritating at times . Had I your lack of ambition I would still be in Covent Garden . " " I am still in Covent Garden . " " Exactly . Ah , do not think I can not read your thoughts when I speak of my Memorial ! I know what you think of my courting personsin high places . Something you could never bring yourself to do , eh ? " " Why , this very afternoon at the meeting I intend to  --  " " Aye ! With me behind you to push you into it . You may thinkp287you have learned what it is to struggle , Jock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to be unconventional , yes ; but I have never thought it a hardship that you felt yourself forced to associate with Spence . Oh , on occasion , " he waved a hand to silence John , " I have seen you lose your temper and brawl for what you wanted . They say you did that sort of thing continually during your war service . But struggle ? " " Wullie , " John said unhappily , " why are you taking me to task in this man " I suppose . . . Gods , Jock , I must vent my spleen on someone , suppose . Now that I am the Queen 's accoucheur , and my Memorial is so near fruition , I find myself wondering if I can make that final effort . Do you understand ? That final effort to place you securely , and bring my own dreams to reality . " " I did not know that you  --  " " That I find it distasteful to toady to rich fools ? You think that no effort ? You think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Ha , you are shocked ? " John felt the blood leave his face . His mouth opened , though no sound came out . He could not take his eyes from William 's cool smile . He sat staring at his brother framed against the carriage windows , while the panorama of London behind his back changed from crowded city streets to the thinner traffic of the outskirts . Still smiling , William took out his silver tabatiere , and with a gesture that was a travesty of Dr. William Hunter , the elegant , he swept a pinch of snuff to his nostrils . " Petee ? " he inquired , extending the box to John . " Wullie , do n't ! " " Oh no , Wullie , " William said , " oh , pray , Wullie , do n't . . . " He looked out of the window at St. George 's looming ahead . " Or is it  --  Oh , pray , Wullie , do ! " At the meeting , the possibility of Middleton 's resigning was an open secret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , " he said when the meeting was ended , " I shall walk hack to town , Wullie . . . Blow the dissection room from my lungs . . . . " " I am certain that that will be best , " William said politely . " Good day , Brother . " " Good day to you , William . "  |p288He  watched William 's carriage rattle smartly down the road . Inside William sat , apparently staring straight ahead . He found himself strolling , deep in thought , not toward London but south to Earl 's Court . A turn in the lane showed him the house where he had spent those months feverish with wine and lung fever and the prerecognition of his impending failure . How tediously he had pushed on to it , diligently ruining preparation after preparation , using his notes , often as not , as spills to light his candles , pressing ever onwards as winter closed in to that stage beyond despair  --  dull indifference . Watching the house , he saw the woman who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pot on the ground . Specks of chickens , black against the setting sun , converged on her , and she stood there looking down on them . She went in , closing the door , and the house was suddenly a face with its windows square eyes reflectingthe sun . The scene was pleasant , still , the fire dying on the trees and houses , leaving them charred , black . There was the faintest rustle of leaves overhead . He was at peace . When he was able to afford it , he would buy or build a cottage out here . On evenings such as this he could go straight from St. George 's to this still calm world . He would not even need a chariot , a horse would fill his needs . At last he turned toward London . He would have to maintain apartments in town , of course ; perhaps , he could even afford to move from the Garden . Golden Square would be pleasant , then he could find companionship whenever he wanted it . But in good weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding into town for his practicewhen he was not due at the hospital . His real work he would do here . He could work late into the night with no one to pry or disturb him . And when at last he wearied , he would go into his summer-scented bedroom where Anne with lifted arms and parted mouth lay awaiting him . He was stunned , immobile . The world died away around him as he gazed on that vision in his mind , minute , clear and fragile as the heart of a tear , of Anne arching her body in the dark to welcome him.  |p289Through  the days that followed he waited for his strange desire for Anne Home , half-vision , half-pang , to dissipate . Yet , when he was least prepared for it , when he was not thinking of her at all , he would feel that warm sensation of melting within and know that in a moment his mind would show him Anne 's arms lifting to him in the darkness . He stood in his rooms in the Garden , gazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a shock how hardened his featureshad become . Above his stained coat his great-jawed head was impaled , pushed down , on his thick stump of neck . When he smiled he bared to the world a strong-toothed yellow grin . He was ugly and nearly penniless . But he had prospects . . . Williamhad said he would not humble himself for them . Now William would see . He went to court Anne . He arrived at the house in Suffolk Streeta new coat of ruby velvet with a ruby chapeau bras with gold lac- gs perched awkwardly on a snowy new wig . Fawn silk hose were retched over his thick calves , and a pair of gleaming new shoes inched his feet cruelly . When Robbie Home came into the parlor nd caught sight of him , waiting , he raised his soft voice into a sub- ucd scream : " My God , it 's Jock ! " John said , looking at him earnestly , knowing his face was plead-g for help in this matter , " Is  --  Annie in ? " Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Some pretty p she had her heart set on has just announced his engagement to heiress . Are you prepared to take his punishment for him ? " " I find that I love her , " John said painfully . " So be it , " Home said , and left the room . I le was afraid to look at Anne for fear she would read in his eyesthat he loved her . She came in , her mouth thin with hurt , her man- remote . " Good evening , Mr. Hunter , what an unexpected pleas/ure I assure you  --  " Then she saw in a glance why he had come and her smile became cruel . " My mother will be down presently , Mr. Hunter . Would you care for tea , or a glass of wine ? " She played the harpsichord for most of the evening . At the door , Robbie demanded , " Well , Jock ? " " I have already asked her , " John said , " to let me wait on her tomorrowevening . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In October David Middleton formally announced his pending resignationfrom the staff of St. George 's . The entire staff of physicians and surgeons was solidly behind John Gunning . Dr. William Hunter had sorted among his friends and acquaintances and found four who were willing to subscribe as contributors to the hospital fund , and thus be entered as new subscribers in John Hunter 's name . There were six candidates for the vacancy in all , but the contest was admittedly one between only John Gunning and John Hunter , surgeonof Covent Garden . Throughout November William canvassed votes assiduously . He gave little supper parties at which John appeared in his new finery . William noted his dress and clapped John manfully on the back as he introduced him proudly to this haughty physician and that bored , torpid nobleman . John bravely produced a frivolous and exorbitantlyexpensive snuffbox and peteed with a restraint and elegancethat had his eyes streaming and his nose clogged with mucus . William looked on and approved . He restricted himself to no more than three oaths of an evening , and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their feet and steadying them as they stood , garrulous and swaying , over the chambers Duncan had brought out from the credenza . He listened avidly to the most boring and petty gossip , he paid wild compliments , and he swallowed slights and outright insults with a smile . He humbled himself in all ways ; and when December came he went , trembling with anticipation , to the Court of Elections of the Hospital of St. George . John Gunning unanimously won the vacancy . John Gunning would take his position as a full surgeon on the staff in January 1765 . " God damn them , God damn them , " John said furiously , crushing his chapeau bras between his hands.  | " Jock , we fought the brave fight , " William said . Brightening , he added , " The next vacancy is surely yours . " " The next ! Oh , God damn them , Wullie , you do not know what this could have meant to me ! " William was watching him narrowly . " There may be some truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now his problem of money was acute . His preparations were never more expensive , and he could not slight them , even for Anne . Nor could he cease bringing Anne little presents ; and there was too , the enlargement of his wardrobe . Anne would not be courted , as the phlegmatic Mary had allowed herself to be , by the mere act of his dining freely at her father 's house , as if it were an ordinary open to any who passed by . There were theater parties for the Home family , at which he sat entranced , not by the events on the stage , but by the sight of Anne 's hands lying in her lap twisting her handkerchief . There were concerts at which he sat sluggish and irritated both , like a hibernating lizard prodded into activity , unable to ignore the intense agitation with which Anne manipulated her fan when some titled coxcomb or rich fop chanced to glance her way more than once . He bought her gloves and then found at the end of an evening that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their steps for the evening after he had deposited her in Suffolk Street , sea rching for it . Yet he never complained , even to himself ; he was In-paradised by a vision he had had months ago , walking along a dusty road on the outskirts of the city . Even as his funds dwindlednd he counted his money with a helpless anger , he was scheming ow to buy land at Earl 's Court , how to afford the bit of Brussels laceat had caught Anne 's eye , how to set aside enough for a really lav-h evening at one of the pleasure gardens , the moment the season Opened . He set out to give himself the reputation of being a surgeon who would travel any distance at any hour of the day or night to attend e patient . He was shameless in his search for " students . " Because of his growing reputation for eccentricity , he attracted several wealthy young men who were bored with gambling at White 's and creating ots at the theaters . It was the fad for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they collecting incunabula , or bones , or the richly exotic headdresses of aborigines . Some of them , as was natural , happened on the field of science as their hobby , and indefatigablyscurried around London , now peering down a contraption made up of a series of lenses guaranteed to magnify a louse 's leg to the size of a tree trunk , now blowing themselves up in the stable by applying a flame to a mysterious gas they had produced by mixing this with that , and at other times running to some anatomist or other to perform that most daring of all larks  --  a human dissection . Had the Devil himself applied to the tooth-shop in Soho to learn anatomy , he would have been warmly received . And of all the idlers who came to gawp , or faint , or even dissect with a genuine fervor , John turned away but one . That one he fell upon with a series of oaths , hastening him down the hallway unceremoniously with threats of violence , pushing him forward so that Jesse Foot , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and throwing him out the door , careless or deaf to the young man 's wailings and howls of certainrevenge . When John had returned to his dissection room , he had found even Jesse Foot silent , and for once blinking , sickened by the sight of the subject with its genitals excised and crammed into its mouth . In the stillness of the room the gigglings and panting of the departed " student " still echoed in their ears . " No more , " Jesse Foot said at last , " than you might expect , John Hunter . Asking in from the very street any and all you accost to come in and  --  " " Shut your boneshop , Foot , or you go next . " " I am waiting for my friend , Mr. Spence , " Foot said , and repaired at once to his corner to seat himself on that chair which , had he but known it , had some time since become known to John and his young men , and even Spence , as the " Foot-stool . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four pounds the ex-student had paid him and send it to his home by messenger . Robbie Home softly declared John a fool to have returned the money . " No , Robbie , you are wrong . I could not have spent it even for a choice preparation . Much less spent it on Annie . " As Anne had a cold and had refused to see him , having shut herself up in herp293room , John stood up to leave . " Could I not , " he said on a sudden inspiration , " bleed her ? Perhaps it might ease her discomfort . " Home laughed . " How Anne would love that pretext to see her ! I n truth , Jock , she is in hiding because she looks a rag . Her nose is red . " John took a step or two , than came to a halt . " Robbie . . . D'ye think she 'll have me . Now  --  or ever ? " " I know less about that girl than I do the Queen of Sweden . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can say , at least , that she is vaporingover no one else at the moment . " " Gods , I can understand well enough why she might not have me . Why , Anne  --  Anne could have her choice of any man in the whole of  --  " " Aye , " Home said dryly , " that is her greatest trouble . She thinks so too . " John began stoutly , " She has every right  --  " " She has no such right . She is no handsomer than Mary or Agnes , and like her sisters , she is merely the daughter of a very ordinary surgeon . But Anne has it in her head , I fancy , to be Lady Someone or Other . She wants to  --  better herself . " He reflected briefly before concluding , " Jock , I think I 'll go upstairs and beat her . " " Give her my love while you are at it , " John said morosely . Anne 's shabby treatment of John was but emphasized the more when John observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own suit with Mary by permitting the young lady to court him . While John sat in the parlor , sourly awaiting by the hour the appearance of the capricious Anne , Mylne was seated by the fire in Home 's study graciously allowing Mary to refill his glass before resumingher place at his feet to listen to his exploits . Resenting the success of his fellow suitor , and yet desiring to please Anne in any way he might , John offered to consult William on the subject of Mylne 's building the Memorial . He was rewarded by a wan smile from Anne , and the lofty admission of Mylne that he might be able to fit the assignment in somewhere . So it was that he found himself coming to visit William at his house in Jermyn Street . William , toasting his feet before his library fire , seemed amused at John 's sudden interest in architecture . " I had not known you thought of the matter at all . "  | " I do n't . I had n't , that is . But Mylne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Westminster Bridge , you know . " John squirmed . " Indeed ! " William said . He smiled the more . " So I thought that if you . . . " Which seemed to be all John could think of to say on the matter . William flicked a speck of soot from his lace . " It is only that your interest in this Mylne is not exactly clear to me , Jock . " " He is a friend of the Home family , " John said humbly . " He plans to marry Mary , Robbie 's third daughter . " " Ah ? Permit me to observe that the girl will be bettering herself if she catches him . " " Home happens to be a surgeon , not a chimney sweep , " John snapped . " I can not see that one of his daughters will be bettering herself by accepting a fat son-of-a-bitch who  --  " " Ha ! Your true opinion of the man comes out . " William forestalled any interruptions by making a brushing away motion with his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infatuation with one of Home 's daughters . I have had the girl pointed out to me . She is a pretty little thing  --  yes . But pushing . The ladies are most conversant in that sort of thing , Brother , and they say the girl is most pushing . However  --  for a dalliance  --  " He looked up innocently as John jumped to his feet . " Look you , Wullie , I love that girl ! I will marry her any time she will have me . Have I made myself  --  " " I should hope she would have you , " William said airily . " It is not as if she were intirely ignorant of my position in town . To be the wife of the brother of the Queen 's physician would advance her in society considerably . Since it is obvious , even to the most casual observer , that your passion for this young woman is rapidly approachingthat stage which may only be called pulsatory , and as  --  " William stopped , gazed back along the path he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but to plunge ahead , and proceeded  --  " ah , inasmuch as I had already been considering your Robert Mylne for the assignment , there could be no harm in letting you take the credit for his appointment , should that come to pass , and thus , I suppose , or rather , I should say , you suppose , pleasing the little Home on that  --  "  | " Wullie , you are a dab ! I can not thank you  --  " " Mercy on us , " William said loftily . " When did you say you were planning to marry her ? " " When she will have me . I should say , when I have the money . " William was curious . " You are really so set on her ? " " I am . " " Fancy , " William said . It was all beyond him . John took himself to Suffolk Street in a glow . Anne would be sure to be pleased . In fact , that evening he rather swaggered before her , showing her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  influence . She smiled on him , and he returned to his grubby rooms in the Garden to take his hoard from out his old surgeon 's chest , and scheme on the making of more money . Mr. Spence appeared in the doorway of John 's " dissection shop " with the request that John come to the front . A lady customer wished to be bled . There was a quaver in Spence 's voice , and with a quick glance at him , John perceived that the gentleman was disturbed by some matter . The way of it was that the lady had , not too long ago , purchased a tooth from Spence . She was not pleased with the transaction . She sat glowering in the most comfortable chair of the shop . John attempted to gentle her , asking in a holy tone to see her mouth . She complied with such a vicious manner that for an instant it crossed John 's mind that she intended to bite him . Cautiously he examinedher . The gum was angry , and only by virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socket at all . Using his fingers alone , John lifted out the tooth . He suggested the gum be allowed to heal a bit , handed the lady a rinse of brandy , and then proposed that she select another , larger , tooth for the socket . " At no expense to yourself , dear lady , " Mr. Spence put in hastily . The lady sulked , her cheeks bulging with the brandy . She spat , narrowly missing John 's cheek , to declare , " I want no more dead corpse teeth in my mouth ! " She swept out.  |p296Mr  . Spence was close to tears . " Oh dear , Mr. Hunter , I do feel that she will do me much harm by talking against me . If only I could have made matters right  --  " " You are disturbing my thoughts ! " John shouted . " Be quiet ! " He sat down in the comfortable chair . He looked at the tooth in his hand . He smelled it . His thoughts dwelt on the foul odor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I believe I know how to make us rich . We are due for a fortune , you and I. Pray have one of your sons go in search of Howison , and bring him here . I myself will explain to him what I want . " Mr. Spence said timidly , " And what , sir , do you want ? " " I want to buy teeth . Live teeth , Mr. Spence . " When next Jesse Foot made his appearance , he was astonished to the point of being taken aback to find John looking up at him with an eager yellow grin . " Ah , Jesse , pray take your seat on the Footst Thatis , pray be seated . Perhaps I can find a decanter of wine hidden somewhere about . . . Ah , here it is , I had hidden it behind  --  " Pouring almost as much wine over Foot as he did into the glass , John sat himself opposite his guest , beaming . " Tell me , Jesse , have you ever read of anyone having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foot stared at him unblinkingly . " Most certainly I have . Fouchard has given a case of a tooth transplanted from the mouth of a soldier to that of a captain . He was in the second battalion of Bourbonnois , I believe . Second ? No . . . Yes , the second battal-ion . " " Remarkable , " John breathed . " Are you planning to steal from Fouchard too ? " " You are not drinking your wine , " John pointed out . " I shall be hurt if you refuse it , sir . " Glee bubbled at the corners of his mouth , he could hardly contain himself . Now he would be rich , and Anne would have him . It was a wet afternoon in February that Duncan appeared unexpectedlyin the tooth-shop asking for John . He wished to take John to the Jermyn Street house.  | " What preparations does Doctor William wish ? " John said , frowningabout him . " Doctor William did not  --  I have come for you myself , Mr. John . " " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not say aye or nay , and with only a glance to John 's current students , escorted John out into the rain where the chariot awaited them . William was not ill . He was seated in the early dusk of his library , his back to the dying fire , his eyes on the rain running down the windowpanes . William was not ill , but the sight of his pale shrunken face , the ruined mouth moving soundlessly with the shapings of unspokenwords , showed John that he had begun the process of dying . Someone or something had broken the ambitious Dr. William Hunter at , the peak of his career . At John 's heavy step , William turned his gaze from the window momentarily . His eyes were filled with the cloudy tears of the defeated and senile . Then he returned to his observation of the rain . " I asked nothing for myself , " he said . " On the contrary , I declared that I would have nothing . Is that not so ? " Without waiting for an answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on in a rasping voice , " I asked only a piece of ground to build upon , that and the Royal approval . I pledged myself to lay out seven thousand pounds for the building , and promised to dedicate it to the public the day it was built . And I told them , I told them over and over that I meant to give my library and preparations . Do you know the worth of my library ? Do you ? I have laid out somewhere between three and four thousand pounds for  --  " " Wullie ! "  --  " and my preparations ! No man could put the proper value on them , for they have been paid for with time and work as well as mere money . I put years of my young life in on them . And so did my brother . Aye , I supported him , and bore with him , and very nearly let him kill himself over those preparations . All of this I offeredto my country as a gift . My youth , and my brother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rasp of William 's complaint thinning away as he went down the hallway in search of Duncan . He found him standing in a doorway , waiting . " We must get him to bed , " John said . " I will bleed him , and then sit with him . He is hysterical , Duncan . " " Damn them ! " Duncan said softly . " He was a great man . . . . "  | " Aye , he was . . . . " Late at night he left the sleeping William to Duncan 's care . He chose to walk to the Garden against Duncan 's protests . The rain had stopped but the night was raw , the clouds , broken up now , floating in pale gleaming ribbons across the dark . His chest ached as it had not since he had left England for the war . It was as if there were an extravasation of tears collecting there . " In truth , " Robert My1ne said , running a fat tongue over his lips to collect the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have alwayssaid that a commission third-hand is really little better than no commission at all . " " Oh did you , Robert ? " Mary asked . " Did you always say that ? " " My brother fully intended  --  " John began , but Anne cut across him crisply , " Though I have never had the pleasure of meeting Dr. Hunter , by all reports I know him to be a man of his word . If you wish to call someone a liar and dishonorable , then look to those who would not keep their promises to Dr. Hunter . For my part , I want to hear no more on the matter , Robert My1ne . Pray take some more meat , John , and then give the plate to my father . Would you not care for more meat , Father ? " " Good lass . " Robbie Home said to no one in particular . If you will have me , John knew his face was saying to her , I will worship you till the day I die . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her flushed face away . In the weeks to follow , John spoke freely of William to Home , while Anne listened quietly . John was disturbed lest William 's mind be somewhat affected by his disappointment , but Home snorted at the idea . " Though I have never met Dr. Hunter , " he said , unconsciouslyborrowing Anne 's words as well as her slightly accusing tone , " I am not inclined to believe that he is one to give way . Most certainly if he is anything like you , he will not . " " Ah , but I relieve myself with tantrums . " " I am somewhat acquainted with that fact , my dear Jock . But to resume the topic of your brother  --  he will revive , never fear . "  | " He talks now of leaving London . Of starting all over again in Scotland . " " We Scotch all talk of returning to Scotland . And wild horses could not drag us fifty feet from London . " " Hmmm . . . Robbie , I would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for his confusion of the present with the past . Only a day or so ago he was telling me that the Monros were going to steal his Atlas of the Gravid Uterus from him before he could complete  --  Oh , pray pardon me , Anne ! " Anne said serenely , " As the daughter of a surgeon I am not unaccustomed to such talk . And as to the future  --  Ma foi , my tongue is running away with me ! " Home sighed . " I was going to ask you how old your brother is , Jock , but I see your thoughts are elsewhere . " " Fifty . . . I believe . . . . " John said , his thoughts elsewhere . As Home had predicted , William decided in late May that he would stay on in London . Relieved , John then had to admit to himself that part of his concern over William had been selfish . Without William 's influence , how would he ever manage to obtain a situation at St. George 's ? Of John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had unsuccessfully tried to exalt his position through favors from the Crown , there was suddenly much talk that spring . A certain young man , a Mr. Jesse Foot , could talk of no other topic wherever he chanced to be . In taverns , at the peruke-makers , even at the Surgeons ' Hall , Mr. Foot made his little comments and told his anecdotes . It was Mr. Foot 's contention that " John Hunter was adept at hanging heavy weights on slender wires , " whatever he meant by that . With his protuberant stone-steady gaze fastened on his audience Mr. Foot went on to say that Hunter propounded the wildest of theoriesfrom the merest of observations . For example , Hunter 's " scion " teeth . What were they ? Why , nothing more nor less than teeth taken from the mouth of one person and tied with silk into the gaping bleeding socket of another ! Mr. Foot himself had been present when Hunter made just such an exchange between a lady and herp300maid . And then the heartless monster had gone swaggering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cries of the agonized maid , deaf to all but the jingle of the money the lady had paid him for his crime . And on what evidence did Hunter place his theory of the efficacy of " scion " teeth  --  why , only on that which Mr. Foot had spoken on himself . And Fouchet had written that though he had transplanted a tooth , the operation was not successful . And yet , Hunter had not even waited to hear him , Mr. Foot , out but had turned awayAs were Mr. Foot 's audience , one by one . Heavy weights on slen Mr. Foot was insisting , and found that only one gentleman remained , bland in the face of Mr. Foot 's insistent stare . " I am somewhat acquainted with Mr. Hunter myself , " that gentlemansaid . " Ah , yes , I have seen you in the tooth-shop . You are  --  " " I am Dr. George Fordyce , and I honor myself that I consider Hunter my friend . I shall not neglect to speak to him of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John was in no wise perturbed at the gossip . Engaged , as always now , on work on the teeth , he did not stop his hands as he chatted with Fordyce . " In truth , he is but advertising me . Gods , he may be responsible for half our patients ! Who knows but what I owe my fine new chariot to none other than my faithful Mr. Foot ? " " He is mad , " Fordyce said , " and well you know it . " " Ah well . . . He is harmless . " Dr. Fordyce did not think so . Now George Fordyce was not himself the most conventional man in town . He too had his little idiosyncrasies . For one , he slept briefly and infrequently . Nor was his wakefulness , as John 's was , due to either the press of work or the pressures of love . Fordyce had both an established practice and family . He even had a few students to whom he taught materia medica and chemistry in the mornings . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few hours of sleep a week sufficed him . So it was that he , charming , educated , far from impoverished , wandered dark and dangerous London night after night in search of companionship . In the bleak hours before dawn he had wrestled for his life with footpads , he had shivered in drafty , dimly lit night-houses , he had had to be rudely ejected from the houses of his friends so that they might go to bed  --  all because hep301could not listen to the even breathing of his wife at his side while he lay awake and alert longing for the sound of a human voice . One meal a day usually was sufficient to keep George Fordyce in good health also . That spring , thanks to Mr. Foot , he had chanced again to come to John Hunter . And in John , himself coming to his dissection room to roll up his sleeves and work , long after midnight and after leaving Anne , Fordyce found that which he sought . Like everyone else who came into his purview , John wondered how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . " Would you care to do me a great service , George ? " " Indeed I would ! " " Then look at my notes on the teeth and see what you can make of them . I have it in mind to publish one day , and yet can not expressthe simplest thought in writing . " " I would be delighted to arrange them , " Fordyce said eagerly , straining his eyes to decipher John 's scrawls in the light of two waveringfarthing dips . " My thanks , " John said , and dimly recognized that he had become quite ruthless in his exploiting of the talents of others . For Anne he would do almost anything . Only his work , his animalpreparations , and his preparations on the teeth , did he refuse to taint or stint for the love of her . Where had all his fine notions of the practice of surgery gone ? Then , he let his thoughts dwell on his new chariot and the parcel of land he had purchased at Earl 's Court ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shelves ; he considered again his plans to move away from the Garden into some rather costly apartments  --  and he told himself : All in good time . When William is able to secure me my position at St. George 's , time enough for me to think seriously about surgery . She had begun to permit him to touch her . Wig askew , nervous lest she detect his pitapatation and smile , he held her and sought for her mouth . At such times her eyes were cool , luminous , exactly on , a level with his , as they examined the effect of the pressure of her breast against his . She noted his breathing , his coloring , the focus ofp302his eyes , and the trembling of his limbs . And once , when she was pulling away , he offered her his wrist on an angry impulse , " You 've not taken my pulse yet , Annie , my love . " Anne laughed , fully in possession of herself . Robbie Home wanted to know , in all sincerity , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensible young woman and marry her . John countered by saying , " I am going to take Anne out to Earl 's Court to show her our land . " " You look an ass in that wig , " Home said . " Take it off . " Anne 's dress was of palest green , a fluttery thing that whipped against her when John urged the horse into a fast trot . Atop her head she was wearing a bonnet that billowed out over her mass of tallow-colored curls , and looked somewhat like a mushroom , and then again did not . From a certain angle it had a tumorous appearancealso , but Anne was vastly pleased with it . Once on the highway , when the wind was free to have at her bonnet , Anne screamed and clutched the monstrous thing to her head and directed her laughinggaze to John . He was enchanted , noting that when they passed under the branches of trees her hair and skin and even her eyes became the same pale green of her dress . Soon they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her hair and leaned back , eyes closed , to turn up her face to the sun . In time the tiny vessels that lay just under her cheeks expanded in the warmth and pinked her complexion . On occasionhe lifted his hand from the reins to caress her , but she remained motionless and composed . At last he said , " Yon 's Earl 's Court , Anne . " She lowered her face to look about her at the grotto of great trees ahead , rising almost like a vision beyond the dust of the road . He offered her the sight with the same solemnity he might have employedwere he making her the gift of his life instead . He urged , " D'ye think it a pretty place ? Does it please you ? " She smiled and said in a tone that , to his regret , he suspected of being deliberately kind , " I find it most pleasing , John . And where are you to build your mansion ? " They crossed over to a lane no wider than the wheel-span @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under which lay grasses short and thick as fur . A neighbor had grazed his sheep here , and patches of white were tangled in low shrubs . Beyond the trees a stone wall wandered , stopping abruptly at a low rise as if having gracefully decided that there could be no purpose in going on . From . the chariot John pointed to the grotto , " I propose to build there . The wall can establish my lawn . " He wanted to continue , to build in her mind 's eye each room of the cottage , ending with that room in which , in his recurring vision , she would spend her dark hours with him ; but Anne had suddenly become animated . She wanted to run among the trees , she wanted to sit on the wall in the sun . And she wanted to be left alone . When he had alighted to walk also , he found himself carrying , for no reason , her bonnet in his hands . He let his curiosity engage his thoughts , examining the underside of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it truly cared to go . Yet ever he was closing in on Anne as he entered deeper into this green world . Overheadthe sky appeared only as shafts of light between the massed leaves , and even as he looked the shafts moved , darted and disappeared . Then he saw Anne step out from behind a trunk . In the faint light her skin was again the color of her dress , and the sward on which she stood seemed but a pool of dress and skin flowing from her . In the water-light he saw her with an extraordinaryclarity , saw the pale green tendrils of her hair lifting with a movement of air so quiet that it did not cool his cheek . The veins in her hands were like those of the leaves just above his head , dark and rich with life . She was thoughtful , head bent , biting her lips , making some decision . Then she raised her head and those bitten lips stood out rose-red in her face . Surrounded by her world of green , she was awaiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonnet fell unnoticed from his hands , and he moved eagerly toward her . She was resigned , quiescent ; her gaze never left his face . Yet , he could not remember later the words she had used in her acceptance of him . She had had little chance to speak at all , he reminded himself wryly , in the face of his impassioned declarations . Their engagement was qualified , that he knew . She would marryp304only an established surgeon , one who was associated with a hospital or who had a reputable practice . One , indeed , who would support her in a manner to which she was far from accustomed . It was only a matter of time before he could fulfill all the requirements , of that he was fiercely certain . Matters seemed to be running smoothly again for the Hunter brothers . William was better and had re-opened his School , with the embattled Dr. Hewson to assist him . And as ever the brothers prowled the board meetings at the hospital seeking tidbits of informationand assurances of future support . John 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though Mr. Spence performed the procedure himself now . John busied himself with his few students , his animal preparations , his Treatise on the Teeth ( for so George Fordyce was beginning to call it ) , his , as yet , slim practice about town  --  the venereal distempers were almost fashionable during the warm months  --  and the building of his cottage at Earl 's Court . He took to going out to the country before his day started , makingthe journey on foot . There he gazed fondly on the skeleton of his house , noting each time how much closer its growth was bringinghim to the fruition of his dream of Anne . But in time , it was no longer the house alone which attracted him to Earl 's Court . He made a few little experiments on the growth of trees ; and later began to stock his land with animals . He had it in mind to make Howisonhis caretaker . On a misty morning , following a night of rain , he rose to make his way again to Earl 's Court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of small rivers . He passed only a weary linkboy on his way home , and , near St. James 's Church , a morose footpad who eyed him sourly in the grim dawn . On Jermyn Street , he saw a chariot drawn up before number forty-two , and as he drew abreast of it , William alighted and stood for a moment drawing in the moist morning air , tottering with weariness . In one hand he held his bag containing the forceps he never used , and in the other his goldheadedcane upon which he leaned . He turned his head to observe John 's approach , the harsh eastern light full on his face . His eye/sockets were filled with puffy flesh the color of porridge , and his shrunken mouth clung dispiritedly to his face under the impending shadow of his nose . John stopped , and the Hunter brothers looked at one another for an endless moment in the sodden dawn . Then , with a tired smile , William said , " Good morning , Jock . " " Good night , Wullie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fitful sleep , and John to his grotto and work . He was late in returning to the tooth-shop , and Mr. Spence greeted him in the way of one who has been waiting impatiently . " Mr. Hunter , before you go to your room . . . a word , sir . " " Aye , Mr. Spence ? Has a customer  --  " " Mr. Foot is back there . " " I am not completely stunned by that piece of intelligence , sir . " John was in a fine mood , he felt very witty . " Sir , I must tell you that he has been going about impugning our work  --  the scion teeth . One of my lads heard it but last evening in a coffeeshop . Mr. Foot  --  most distressing ! " " Out with it , Mr. Spence . " " He has been saying that we are implanting venereal poisons along with teeth . He has been going about giving it out in the nature of a warning  --  that one can take the venereal distemper of the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state of dismay I know not what to say to Mr.  --  " " I know what to say to him . " In his own ears his feet sounded like those of a giant stomping down the hallway . He burst into his dissection room , gaze rushing past his two students to fasten on the steady stare of Jesse Foot . " You son-of-a-whore , " John said levelly , " if ever I see you again I will open up every vein in your body . " From his pocket he withdrew his lancet , opening it without taking his eyes from Foot . Still Foot said nothing , though the crumpling had begun . His elongatedface broke into horizontal planes , his narrow temples seeming to shrink within his worn wig . A strange sound as of an animal feelingthe inexorable bite of the trap rose in the room , coming from nowhere . " Mr. Hunter , " a student murmured , " I fear he is going to  --  "  |p306But  by then Foot had fallen at John 's feet , his body writhing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eyes turned up in his head . His wig came off and he bumped and knocked his shorn head mercilessly on the floor . John seized him by an ear , thrusting the handle of his lancet into the mouth , holding down the tongue . Again Foot wailed and opened his eyes . He lay still . " Give him some wine , " John said , " and then throw him out into the street . " He left the room to seek solitude in Mr. Spence 's room with the electrical machine . In time he heard steps coming toward the door . He waited for them to pass . They did not . Jesse Foot stood in the doorway looking at him , tears slowly coursing down his face . " When you need me , " he said sorrowfully , " I will come . Remember , Hunter . . . . " John turned his back . " I do not want to do an injury to one such as you , Jesse Foot . Do not force me  --  " " When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come . " After a moment , he added as if in warning , " Never fear , John Hunter . . . . " He was gone . The students were dissecting quietly when John re-entered his room . One of them had a question to ask . " I should have done it long ago , " John said to himself , ignoring his student . " It would have been better , sir , " the student ventured . " I , for one , am afraid of the mad . " John did not see nor hear of Mr. Foot again . Fortunately he had silenced him before Foot could do harm to Spence 's business . When winter , the season of fractures and lung fevers , came on , John 's practicepicked up a bit . He had enough now to enable him to move from the Garden to the more fashionable Golden Square . His rooms had the further advantage of opening off a back stair , up which the faithful Howison might creep of a night stealthily dragging his sack behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fordyce came late one afternoon with a strange young man in tow . With much arching of his dark brows and half-realized gestures pregnant with some meaningp307John could not grasp , George Fordyce introduced the youth as Mr. Joseph Banks . Still John watched the signaling brow , the twitching hands , and wondered . Before him was a lad of twenty-one or so , a mannered and intelligent young man , and by his satin suit and ermine muff , a rich one . He had come , at Dr. Fordyce 's kind suggestion , to see John 's collection of animal preparations . He was to all appearances , John was pleased to note , of a scientific turn of mind . Mr. Joseph Banks was a newly elected member of the Royal Society , he admitted with a nice display of modesty . He hoped to occupy himself as a naturalist . " Would you be interested in performing a human dissection ? " John asked after some moments of struggling to contain himself . Charge him six guineas if you charge him a farthing , his greed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Banks decided , though he was emboldenedto take it as an honor that Mr. Hunter should be so graciousas to offer his great knowledge and et cetera . Damme , what does he want , John asked himself . It was only that Mr. Banks was helplessly drawn by all manner of scientific oddments , that was all . And never had he been so impressedas he was this day . He was proposing to go on a trip to Newfoundland that summer to collect some botanical specimens , and it had just come to him that he might bring Mr. Hunter a few animals also . Would there be anything in particular Mr. Hunter desired ? Having seen and admired to his depths Mr. Hunter 's museum ( Bygar , Museum ! Shall I bow , or merely continue on as I am  --  grinning like an ass. ) . . . he , Joseph Banks , would find it a privilege to contribute to it in some small way by bringing Mr. Hunter a few dozen animals or so from " My God , " John cried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Banks grew slightly bewildered . " Why , certainly Dr. Hun  --  " " Mr. " "  --  ter . Since we shall not fill the hold of the ship in any way with only our botanical specimens , I thought we might take up the slack with animals . "  | " Ah , but the one who is financing this expedition might not care to carry free cargo . Pray , who is to finance the trip , sir ? " Still bewildered , Mr. Banks looked briefly to the snickering Dr. Fordyce before answering patiently , " Why  --  I am , Mr. Hunter . " John pulled his chair closer to this charming Joseph Banks . He could barely keep his hands from patting the fresh young cheeks , barely prevent his tongue from inquiring fondly as to the size of the fortune possessed by such a handsome and winning lad . Ah , what a treasure of a young man , John 's eyes declared , and he grinned so broadly , bringing the prognathous jaw into full play , that Mr. Joseph Banks drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality to it , somewhat like the toothy approval a tiger bestows on the grazing hart . " You are financing the expedition ? " John was saying joyfully . " Ah , sir , I can not express my approval of your wisdom . " Leaning forward ( he was rather in pursuit of the retreating Mr. Banks ) , he summoned his most reasonable tone of voice , " Now then , sir , how many species of animals do you calculate Newfoundland to have ? " " Why , in truth , Mr. Hunter , I could not hazard  --  " " Could you , " John went on , clinging desperately to his tone of assured reasonableness , " bring me a sample of each ? " Mr. Banks , now finding himself backed up against a table , faltered , " I can not promise  --  but I will try . " " Ah ! " George Fordyce put his head in his hands and shook . John spoke with such fulsome praise of Mr. Banks to Anne that evening that she at last remarked snappishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone unless they stink of dead animals or rotted vegetables ? I should think this Mr. Banks could put his fortune to better use by entering society and enriching culture . He might support a magazine devoted to young poets , for example , or  --  " " Anne , do n't talk like a fool , " John said shortly , forgetting himself . She swept to the harpsichord , where she spent the evening . Little Everard , now no longer so little , engaged John in a game of loo . John cheated so cleverly , and with so bland an expression , that Everarddid not find him out , and was sent to bed howling his rage at having lost every game . For his part , Robert Mylne whiled the hours picking morsels ofp309his supper from his teeth . His free hand lay familiarly on Mary 's arm . " I fear , " Robbie Home said thoughtfully , at the evening 's end , " that Everard will be much punished in life for his sensitivity . The cruel world always finds and tortures them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " John said solemnly . " Too true , Robbie . " He lingered ; but when he left he had Anne 's brief kiss on his mouth to warm him all the way home to Golden Square . He saw the affluent Mr. Joseph Banks several times that spring . He and Fordyce and Banks went the rounds of the taverns , ending in the Garden . Mr. Banks and Fordyce were drunk and garrulous on punch , John on the prospect of free acquisitions for his " museum . " He cracked coarse jokes in a loud voice , clapping the retiringFordyce on the back many times , and bending on the modest Joseph his ever devouring smile of delight . After a time Joseph grew somewhat used to John 's enthusiasm and managed to relax in the face of such concentrated appreciation . They left the Bedford Tavern at dawn , groping their way through a thick fog . Among the several opinions expressed by Joseph had been his conviction that Mr. Hunter would be a valuable addition to the rolls of the Royal Society . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though within he grew angry at the thought of this pup being invited to become a Fellow because of affluence and influenceonly , while Dr. William Hunter had for years knocked on the barred doors in vain. " . . . a paper on any of your many marvelous preparations would effect your immediate entry , sir , " Joseph was saying . " I would aid you in the writing , Jock , " Fordyce volunteered . " Most kind , by all means . . . . " John said . Then , when Banks left on his expedition , John forgot about the paper . William clutched the preparation he had come to borrow . Almost on the point of departure he had paused in the doorway to ask casu/ally , " Is it definite then , that you are going to marry your Miss Home ? " " Indeed , yes , Brother . " " She has condescended to have you , eh ? " " Oh come , Wullie , let us not fall out about the subject . I want you to take pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must , " William said with a sigh . " Ah well , with our sister 's children carrying the name of Baillie , it will be good to think that more Hunters are due to arrive one day . " He made a noble attempt to wax hearty . " And God knows I am not likely to father any future Hunters . Let us make a bargain , Jock . I 'll make a physician out of your firstborn son , if you 'll name him after me . " " Come back in , " John cried , " and we 'll drink to it . " They touched glasses solemnly . " To the second Dr. William Hunter , " they intoned , grinning foolishly . On the first fine day he was free , he drove Anne out to see the completed cottage at Earl 's Court . She was able to bear the impact of its magnificence with complete composure . " What a charming little nook in case it rained during a picnic . " For a moment , memories of the hours of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the summons of any who roused him , his scrabbling for students , his fevered preparations on the teeth for the forthcoming Treatise  --  all to secure money for this cottage and their future , gathered in his throat , thick as passion . " You are going to spend your summers in this charming little nook ' one day , Anne Home ! " he shouted . " I built it for you , and you 're going to live in it . D'ye understand ? " " Ma foi , " Anne said airily . " And , pray , where is my drawing room ? That patch of grass over there with the cow sleeping on it ? And where do my guests sit , on that broken wall ? " Beside himself , he shoved his ugly face at her and shouted the louder . " Damn you , I 'll build an addition on it . This little house that I put every farthing on for you will be my laboratory then . I 'll build you a barn large enough to hold every fop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in it ! Is that clear , Annie , my dearest love ? " " La , " Anne said uncertainly . " Pray , Mr. Hunter , cease taking that liberty with your hand . . . . " They were silent all the way back to town . Damn her , where didp311she expect a man to get enough money to marry her ? Steal it ? She forgot herself , she was only the daughter of a poor surgeon . Or did she think some lord was going to fall at her feet one day and " Bitch ! " he muttered involuntarily . " How kind of you to say so , " Anne snarled . Suddenly she laughed . He turned to her eagerly , humbly . " Forgiveme ! You drive me to  --  Gods , you know I would give my life for you ! " " Aye , " Anne said , allowing him to kiss her hands , " I know . " He mortgaged his lease on the Earl 's Court property in order to build onto the cottage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only he were ready to publish on the teeth and realize some money from the sale of the treatise ; but he could not establish whether or not the teeth were vascular , and he shrank from rushing into print unprepared . He wished he could murder John Gunning and have himself elected to his place at the hospital . He thought of experimenting with botanicals until he discovered an overnight cure for the venereal distempers . But he knew that for him there was never the fortunate misstep , never the lightning concept , only the wresting from each stubborn chunk of f esh some little point , some little confirmation of a simple theory , knowledge growing slowly as a stalagmite in his mind . At times , engaged in the tooth-shop , he suffered a constriction of his heart . I am not practicing surgery at all , he thought drearily . I am merely pursuing money . He pushed the thought away . He was growing rather haggard , George Fordyce observed . " Have you decided to fill the shoes of the long-departed Mr. Foot ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours and my appearance ? " " Pray , " Fordyce said gently , " do not think I wished to offend you , Jock . " And to further assure John of his unwillingness to quarrel , he added humorously , " I shall draw up the Foot-stool and watch you in complete silence . " " It is I who should apologize , " John said . " George , I am so beset by  --  " It was needless to state what Fordyce already knew . He worked in silence for some time.  | " Ah , nosiness that natuary of genius ! " Fordyce burst out . John turned away from his preparation to stare . " I am given to such statements , " Fordyce explained contritely . " I took my master 's degree at fourteen . " " Then you can not help yourself , " John said comfortingly . " Jock , you will join me in a bumper later , wo n't you ? " " Come with me to visit the Homes , instead , " John countered . But Fordyce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet him at the end of the evening . He was the only person he knew who could keep pace with the lonely and sleepless Fordyce . He was quitting the tooth-shop when a figure emerged from the dark . A callused hand seized his , a grin , white in a browned face , glittered in competition with Mr. Spence 's wares . " Mr. Hunter , I was afraid I had missed you ! Sir , I have all manner of  --  " " Joseph Banks ! When did you  --  " " My house is but a few doors from here , sir . Could you not join me in a glass while we examine what I brought back for you ? " Fordyce vanished from John 's mind ; dimly Anne called out even as she too was dissolving . " I must not keep a lady waiting , " he began , " and yet the thought of  --  Come with me to see the lady , and then we will return here . I do not want so much as to lose sight of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours , Mr. Hunter ? " " Yours , " John said . He added , " Come to think of it , I have no carriage . How many species did you find in Newfoundland , my fine young friend ? " They were admitted by one of the quiet middle children of the Home family . The first of the elder members to come into the parlorwas Anne . John went toward her , eager and proprietary , some such phrase as " Miss Home , my wife-to-be " on his tongue when her comeliness stilled him . It was as if she had awakened from a long and refreshing sleep , her eyes intensifying , gaining color , her breath becoming shallow and rapid . She was looking past John to Joseph Banks standing quietly by his chair . " Mr. Banks . . . " John said inadequately , and watched as Banks performed an elegant leg . Anne gave Banks her hand . " Mr. Hunter is my father 's dearestp313friend , sir , " she said cordially . " I am sure he will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She turned her head to John . " Father is in his study , Mr. Hunter . He will be so happy to see you . " Her gaze , which usually met John 's directly , now demurely lowereditself to rest somewhere on the region of his stock . She is makingan ass of herself before me , John thought angrily , and was turning to Banks to declare his situation with Anne , when , as with Anne , he was struck by the exceeding beauty of the young man . This night Banks was clad in deep blue velvet , a color so becoming to him that one did not realize at first that the effect of his bright glance in a browned face was partially due to his clothes and his wig , most faintly tinted also with blue . Anne 's fan was suddenly in evidence , fluttering against her breast . Within the hour , John knew , that fan would be tapping Banks provocativelyon the arm , would be shielding all but her eyes when she , laughing in protest , would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will not have it so , John thought , but in that moment Anne capturedhis attention . Her pleading gaze said to him plainly : If you love me , do not take this chance away from me . I am but a year or so older than he , and he is handsome  --  and rich ! And such was the social art of an Anne Home that while she was throwing herself on John 's mercy , her lips were asking casually , " Are you a married man , Mr. Banks ? " " My heart is yours , Miss Home , " Banks replied gallantly . In the months to follow , John looked on in pain and humiliation while Anne made a fool of herself over Joseph Banks . I will see it through , he told himself stolidly . For Anne had not turned John away . The Homes were very gay that winter season . There were alwayslittle parties , soirees , and musicales , and every play that came to the Garden or Drury Lane was one that Anne wistfully declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her , she seemed top314be wearing a dress more elaborate than the one before . She moved through the parties as festooned with lace and puffs and flounces as the mistress of a peer . Her voice was high and attenuated ; yet she could break off at the peak of a laugh like someone snapping an icicle from an eave . Saddened , John watched her , wanting to catch her to him and hide her face against his coat , to comfort her at those very times when her mood was the gayest , her eyes most bright . Always Joe Banks was near her . He smiled down at her , he danced attendance on her , he took her everywhere in his ostentatiouscarriage . Yet he was no less attentive to the frantically concentratingMrs . Home , or even to some decrepit remnant of eighty whom Mrs. Home entertained infrequently as an act of charity . When young Joe was alone with John , he spoke as if bewitched on " all things scientifick , " but Anne 's name never crossed his lips . Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home family , " which perforce included that obnoxious lad Everard , as well as the other six children , and possibly , Robert Mylne . There ! John told himself , Anne is but flirting with Joe , and well he knows it . It means nothing . And satiated with the abundance of animals Banks had brought him for preparations , he was able to save his money toward enlargingthe house at Earl 's Court . So , biding his time , he consulted with his builder as to the exposure of the drawing room , the dimensions of Anne 's own parlor , of her private closet , of her sunroom  --  of their room together . He had another thing to pin his hopes on . The better he knew Joe , the more he realized that here was a young man who stood forever on the edge of an abyss , desiring to jump . What lay beyond , whether it be at the bottom of Hell , or no , Joe wanted to go there . Strange lands , unknown dangers , all were included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not save yourself from loving Joe . He was an incorrigiblebenefactor , showering anyone who would take them , with gifts . He gave with such an unremitting fervor that George Fordyce remarked once , musing , " One has to remind oneself that he is not penniless and hunchbacked . At times I see him so , all covered over in his tallness and his money . "  | " Aye , " John said . After a moment he added , almost as if asking a question , " He has succeeded in getting me invited to join the Royal Society . " " By all means , " George said quickly . " Such an association will bring you a better class of patients . " " It matters little , " John said dryly , " where they received the distemper : on Robert Mylne 's bridge , or in milady 's bed . " " You are too holy for me today , Jock . Read a paper on it to the Society . " " That I will , George Fordyce . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Banks was instrumental in John 's invitation to the Society , but that he must informWilliam of it at once . He must do it , explaining the way of it , before William got the news elsewhere . The Fellows of the Royal Society , presumably the most learned men in England , and the world for that matter , were not to a man , wise , mellowed , and accomplished . In the Society influence was tantamount , if not superior , to talent ; and every brash young heir who came up from Oxford could become a Fellow with little trouble . At the meetings , during the reading of the papers , retired Army men were seen to doze in their seats , and dilettante noblemen twitched with impatience because the paper did not cover a current fad of theirs . Yet the Society took itself seriously , it was a scientific society , and therefore it was daring , advanced , and useful to the welfare of England , despite the snoring retired colonels . Usually a Fellow was selected after he had presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member . Dr. William Hunter , had , over the years , presented several such papers , all unsuccessfully . Mr. John Hunter , surgeon of Golden Square , being described in his certificate as skilled in natural history and anatomy , had presented none . " Mercy on us , Jock , " Dr. William Hunter said , " what a marvelous jest on the part of your Joe Banks ! Introducing you to the Society ! I vow that young man must be the soul of wit ! " " Pray , Wullie  --  " John began helplessly.  | " But then  --  I forget ! You attended Oxford ! Unfortunately , I was never able to afford such a luxury for myself . " William flung himself about in his chair as petulantly as an invalid . " Naturally , such a poor and uneducated thing as the Queen 's Own Physician is hardly to be considered worthy of  --  " " Wullie , will you cease indulging yourself in a paddywhack and attend me ? I have the ear of Joe Banks on the matter of your invitationnext @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next two months  --  " " Damme , in that case , I must hasten to prepare my paper ! Let me think : shall I write on The Incidence of the Venereal Distemper in Conjunction with Transplanted Teeth ? " " You might , " John snapped , " consider : My Discovery of the Placental Circulation ! " He had gone too far . John was privileged to watch William crumple under the hurt , seeing , with a great pain of his own , the courage and mighty anger of Dr. William Hunter drain out of him in tears of indulgent self-pity . " Ah , Wullie , " he said urgently , " you know what my temper has always been ! Never am I so apt to lie and calumniate as when I have lost  --  " " Leave me be , " Dr. William Hunter said , his tears flowing freely now . " I am tired and given to weeping even when I am not sad . My eyes , Brother , are constantly burning . . . It is nothing . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own . . . Lord Bute promising me , promising me that my Memorial .. . Own brother associated with a dentist . A dentist , no less . . . . " William Hunter was exactly fifty . The difficulty lay in John 's closeting himself with Joe Banks alone . He persisted , finally cornering his young friend in the Homes ' parlor , having begged Robbie to keep the family out on any pretext that came into his head . Then , in the course of the conversation , Robert Mylne wandered in , his fat face indicating that he had overheard what was said , howeverhis fat mouth might deny it . Young Banks was nothing if not magnanimous . His winning smile announced that there was no earthly reason why Dr. William Hunter and Mr. Robert Mylne both could not adorn the Society.  |p317Damme  , John thought , glowering squarely into Mylne 's smug smirk , just how did he manage to insinuate himself into the matter ? In April Dr. William Hunter became a Fellow of the Royal Society . In May Robert Mylne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time before that , John was destined to see his co-suitor but infrequently , whether at the Home household or anywhere else  --  except the Society meetings . It was still April when John groped his way to the tooth-shop through a swirling yellow fog , to find Spence in the back idly shockinghimself with his electrical machine , a lone customer waiting to be blooded , and a dullard of a duke 's son , his only student at the moment , desperately forcing himself to continue with a dissection begun as the result of his losing a wager . Were he to emerge from the experience acquainted with the major differences between the arm and the leg , John could consider himself a nonpareil as a teacher . He bled the customer , absently holding the basin and looking out the window , past the hand holding the tooth aloft , to watch a sedan lumber by , looking for all the world like a strange four-legged insect ; and listen to a carriage that was all sound and no sight , like a ghost in reverse . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one excuse or another to stay home for the day . He wiped his lancet on his sleeve and closed the lips of the wound with plaster . His departing customer let in a cloud of fog as he closed the door behind him . Still holding his lancet , John pondered . Robbie would be out on his rounds . Joe Banks was undoubtedly over at Dr. Solander 's , a a block or so away , talking botany . The younger Home children were in school ; Mrs. Home and Mary and Agnes would be in the kitchen ; and Anne would be at her desk in the parlor slaving over a poem . He closed his lancet and thrust it into his pocket . In his other pocket sagged the final plans for enlarging the house at Earl 's Court . He would need Anne 's approval of them before he undertook the prohibitive expense of the project.  |p318He  found Anne indeed at the desk prettily frowning and tickling her chin with the quill , as she sought her muse . There was a candle burning steadily at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her face , nor did it reflect in her dulled eyes . When she turned to him , John saw that her nostrils were pinched . She was both taut and weary , as if tired of some struggle within herself and yet compelled to carry it on . She smiled listlessly when he spread out the plans before her on the desk . " I am certain that the house will be most accommodating for you , John , " she murmured politely , drawing the quill back and forth under her chin and showing no more voluptuous response to the sensation than a corpse might have . " I am not building it for myself alone , Anne , " he reminded her gently . " It is exactly as you wanted it , is it not ? " " I ? " She turned to look out at the fog , uninterested . " Annie , you said you would want a drawing room , and here is one . You said you would want . . . " He grew silent , for if she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anne ? Anne , that first time I showed you Earl 's Court , that first day on which you allowed me to  --  " She jerked around to him . " Sir , I may have allowed you liberties ; if so , I do not find it becoming in a gentleman to confront me with my " " Liberties ! You witless little  --  I declared myself ! And you permittedmy addresses . Well you know that from that day on I have done nothing but work and slave and drudge with you in mind ! Every guinea I took in , I told myself that I could put it to good use for you . I have mortgaged my property  --  " he slammed his hand down on the plans  --  " to obtain the money to build this . What need have I for a drawing room ? What earthly need  --  " " My head does ache so , of a sudden , " Anne said , and with shouldersdrooping , attempted to rise . He held her down in her chair . Her cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more securely ; but he said , gently enough , " What is it , Anne ? How have I displeased you ? " She avoided his gaze , again turning to the window . " You have done nothing to displease me , John , my dear . Unless it be that you come here with the plans of a house I know nothing about and yell at me that I  --  "  | " Blawfum , Anne ! " He had blundered ; far from being jollied , she straightened up with insult . " Anne , I spoke too hastily . Do not draw away from me , we must have this matter out . If we are to be happy together we must learn to understand one another . " " You take too much to yourself , " she said coldly . " I have never considered myself bound or betrothed to you , sir . " " At least , not since you began mooning over Joe Banks ! Is that it , my fine lady ? " She sat for a moment in judgment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love him with all my heart , John . " She was pathetic . She and her brave declaration alike both saddenedand galled him . He was a man with work to do , and money he had earned for her to spend . It was time , past time , she put away her poetry and her fancies and squarely faced her duties to both of them . Well now , he would simply dismiss what she had said as being a giddy remark intended to tease him . He said deliberately , evenly , " Anne , Joe Banks does not know you exist . He is friendly to your family because of me . Do you think your house the only one in Londonhe visits to have pretty young women in it ? Why , I have heard his name linked with every girl in town  --  and with a handsome young widow too . . . . Pray , let 's have no more of this . What do you think of our house ? " " It scarcely matters since I shall never live in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him to fondle it and soften what next he said . " Annie , my love , let me advise you . Joe is a fine lad . Aye , and a rich one . But he 'll not have you . Hear me , my fine lady , he 'll not waste himself and his fortune on the daughter of a poor surgeon , however charming she may be . He 'll take to wife a girl with as much money as he has , and she 'll be as pretty as you . Do you hear me , Anne ? " When she turned her pinched nostrils to him , her eyes were flat with hatred . " You ugly little man with your thick features and your vile person ! " Her voice was quite calm . " You smell of death , John Hunter . You smell of death and blood . You are crude and virtually unlettered , you dance as a sow might staggering in her wallow , and when you touch me I see the collection of rotted flesh and filth under your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Hunter , and had not my father  --  " Though her voice faltered , her glancep320did not . Then at last she relented and dropped her eyes . " Forgive me , Mr. Hunter . " He had but one question . " You mentioned your father , Anne . That day at Earl 's Court , that first day  --  " " He had asked me to consider you , no more . " " Then that day  --  why did you permit me ? " She shook her head . " Anne ! " She said in a small voice , " I do not know  --  unless it was that I was curious .

" Good day , Miss Home . " She was already staring out the window again . Not until he had reached the door did she say in her customary high tones , " When I am Mrs. Joseph Banks , Mr. Hunter , will you come to tea one day ? " " Aye . That day I will come . " Robbie was coming up the steps as he left the house . He brushed past and Robbie 's voice drifted out of the fog , " Jock ! Good God , Jock , what  --  " Wandering about in the fog , careless of the carriages that rushed down on him out of nowhere , to clatter by within inches of his coat , he was tormented by the vision , never before so real , so clear , of Anne in his house in Earl 's Court , awaiting him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where men wept freely at plays , where they spilled copioustears on their lace stocks and the printed pages of novels , where men of venerable years sobbed aloud at musicales or at the sight of a painting ; in such a town there was no closet , no room where sound would not carry , no refuge where a man , broken not by the fancies of others , but his own folly , might go in private  --  to weep . Patients would be waiting on him in his parlor in Golden Square ,  |p321his  dullard would be desecrating flesh still at the tooth-shop  --  in all the world he would find no solitude . At last he stumbled into a tavern . In a dark corner he sat over his bumper , shovel jaw sagging , staring down at his stained hands . He did not bother to raise his eyes when a voice said : " Why , it is Jock Hunter , is it not ? " " Join me , Colin , " John said . " I recollect that when first we met it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seating himself . " You are looking fit , Jock . Tell me , how have you been ? " John began to laugh . Past midnight he sat at his desk putting down his thoughts as Fordyce had encouraged him to do : A man has an appetite to enjoy a woman ; but if the mind has formed itself to any particular woman , the appetite or enjoyment can be suspended till that object is presented ; and the more the mind interferes , the greater stress will be laid upon this relation : the mere sexual enjoyment will be almost forgot , and the whole pursuit will be after the particular quality of the appetite . He read what he had written , and then added : If a man has not fallen in love by his fortieth year , he would do well to refrain from it thereafter . He was thirty-nine . He blew out his candle and sat motionless in the dark , he knew not for how long a time , thinking of nothing whatsoever . Howison was the first to know of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in John 's behalf . He had waited till long after dark that wet May night to drag his sack up the convenient back stair leading to John 's quarters in Golden Square . Panting from his exertions , Howison had lingered to rest , while John examined the body . Though the night was wet , it was distressingly warm , and the curtainslifted silently from the open windows at each moist breath ofp322the air . When the flames of the farthing dips guttered and bent to one side , the hanged man seemed to blink and the broken veins on his cheeks and neck to writhe . The trunk and limbs of the hanged man were handsome , like Greek marble covered with a fine patina of filth , and there was only an angry swelling in the left groin to mar the classic structure which had been his . As Howison watched idly , John touched this swelling or bubo with his scalpel , not incising the skin but merely outlining the area . " Like as not , " John murmured , " he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Howison said . " Will you be wanting the teeth , Jock ? " he hinted . " If not , I might realize a shilling or so on them from old Spence . " He was taken by surprise by the vehemenceof John 's reply . " The teeth are yours . God knows , it is past time I have done with the damned things , and become a surgeon again ! " So saying , he made his first incision just above the pubis . Not wishing to press the matter further with John in such an explosivemood , Howison wisely changed the subject . " Jock , " he asked carelessly , " how does one get the venereal distemper ? " " Ha . " Howison grew earnest . " Ah , aside from that , you wag ! And I was trying to say : when is it a man gets one and not the other ? Or both , you might say ? " He scratched his head as if the effort of trying to regiment his thoughts had made him itch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that head . " In afterthought John added , " Yet , I have no way to prove it . Animals can not be infected , and what human being would offer himself ? " Howison delivered himself of a bark . " Not I ! " Then , chuckling to himself still , he announced that he was soon due to meet a lady on the Bridge and might yet present Jock with his proof . He departed in high spirits , money jingling in his pockets . Howison must have gained the street and gone several blocks before he slowed his pace , stopped dead in the mist , uttered a horrified , " Damme , he would not . . . even Jock would not . . . . " and hastily retraced his steps . He found John in his chair by the cadaver , his ivory-handled lancetgleaming softly in his hand . The farthing dips had been placed along the edge of the dissection table as if to light up a surgical field.  |p323John  sat in a trance . His clothes were opened and he was staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two punctures he had made in his flesh . Some material remaining on the point of the lancet resembledthat which had earlier stained his scalpel as he had cut into the bubo . Howison began faintly , " I forgot to take my teeth with  --  " and could go no further . Not raising his head , John said , " I am a surgeon again . " When William came to visit him one evening in early fall ( a cozily commiserative William ; the Hunter brothers , unappreciated by women or the world ) , he found John , shirtless , at his desk scribbling at his notes . Only William 's slight asperity of tone revealed his disappointmentat finding John busy , and therefore , quite cheerful . Williamchose a chair and eased himself into it , to rest his chin on his gold-headed cane , surveying John sourly . " Do you always receive guests in that half-naked condition ? " Williamasked . " D'ye consider yourself a guest , Wullie ? Moreover , I wished to make some notes while the observations were fresh in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your clothes to make these observa-tions ? " " Aye . " But William was not in the mood to be toyed with . He had come to John for intelligent , serious discussion . Among other things he wished to complain of Dr. Hewson , and to inquire ever so evasively and vaguely what plans John might be entertaining for the near future . Excluding the always present hope of a situation at St. George 's . Not that he was contemplating asking John to . . . It was merely that Hewson was literally stealing preparations belonging to the School , under some fool claim that since he had made the preparationsthey were his . . . . It was too saucy of him , too annoying . . . . Moreover , William was plagued by a toothache . " Wullie , why do you not let me pull those snags for you ? I am little concerned these days with the tooth-shop , but Spence and I are on the friendliest of terms  --  "  | " If you are working around to that scion tooth ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me inform you that I will have no part of it . I do not hold with quackery , Jock . " Still cheerful , John shrugged . The movement caught William 's strained gaze and he added disdainfully , " Physician , heal thyself . Why do you not put some salve on that rash you 've all over your back and shoulders ? My God , Jock , one would think you to be lousy . " " Not at all , " John said , " this happens to be a pox brought on by the gonorrheal poison . " He scratched himself casually . William was scandalized , stricken , stunned . Through a spray of spittle he managed , " But there is no such  --  Jock , I can not  --  " then cried  --  " who ? . . . " before he tried , with a choking sound , to recall the word , and ended weakly with a soft wail , " Jock . . . . " John was openly amused . " Aye , I have been traveling in high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , I turned in bed and said to Lady  --  " William had somewhat recovered . " Pray , do not jest . Are you curingyourself ? Which of the poisons do you think yourself to have ? Although it would seem clear to me that  --  " " Both , " John said bluntly . " Being that both poisons are but one . I 've inoculated myself to prove it . " " To prove what ? " William shouted . " Why , as I said , to prove that there is but one venereal poison . I had long suspected that it manifested itself in several ways , and thus we were all led to believe that two diseases were involved . In mucous tissue the disease exhibits itself as the distemper , in other tissue as the pox . " John indicated his notes with a wave of his hand . " You might read them , Wullie , if you care to . " William licked his lips . " How did you  --  where did you get your material ? " " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my lancet and rubbed the poison in well . " John was cool in the face of William 's perturbation . He pushed his notes at his brother , and restinghis chin on his cane , William began to read . Once William said fretfully , " You have always made such garbled notes , that I can not make head nor tail of them . What other treatmenthave you employed than mercuric salve ? " " Why , none , brother . That is my point . Though I have shownp325symptoms of what were believed to be two diseases , the simple treatmentfor the distemper has cured me  --  or , I should say  --  will cure me as soon as I resume my use of the salve . I was healing too rapidly , you see , and I wanted to keep the poison active so that I might make further observations . " William raised his chin from his cane . " You fool , " he said bitterly . " I could weep for you , Jock . You may as well have gelded yourself over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weep ! " John was superior . " Do n't fret your guts to fiddle-strings for nothing , brother . I tell you I am in full control of the situation . I can cure myself any time I choose . " " I can not find it in your notes when you did this . " " In May . " " May ! That long ago ! I was thinking it was a matter of a few days  --  Oh my God , you have let the poison get into your blood ! " William threw the notes to the floor . " I beg of you to enter at once on a severe course of salivation . You can come to my house with me and no one shall know of it . Tell your acquaintances that you must leave town for a few months . Duncan will be silent as the grave , we can rely on his discretion . You need never leave the house and no one will know where you are . " " This is the first time , " John said slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wullie . " " Doubted ? I have decried everything you have done since you associated with Spence ! Your quackeries with your scion teeth ' and your dancing attendance on customers in a tooth-shop like a ' bootblackready to hand  --  But I told myself , my brother is a man and I must presume that he knows his own mind . I should have thought that my obvious eagerness to place you at the hospital would have given you some clue as to my thoughts on your way of life . But this ! Doubt is too mild a word . This inoculation of yourself with God knows what , or how many , venereal poisons , from the corpse of a hanged man , from a corpse that died before the symptoms and effectsof his disease  --  whatever it was  --  could show themselves  --  " William could find no more words , though his mouth continued to move after his voice was stilled . " I tell you , " John said flatly , " that he had but one disease . The venereal disease . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragging his canep326across the floor . He stopped and turned to make his final appeal . " Come with me now , Jock . " Dimly his strained eyes could make out the rash on John 's shoulders . " None of us know what are the ultimate effects of the Great Pox , but , God help us , we are beginning to suspectthem . I beg of you to save yourself . It is a duty you owe to me . Jock ? Jock , have you not long known what is in my heart ? Jamie would not have been the best of us . . . for you are . " Dr. William Hunter , the Queen 's Physician , begged humbly , " Let me take care of you , Brother . " " I am quite capable of caring for myself , thank you , " John said politely . " For , as I have told you a number of times tonight there is but one  --  " " And I tell you , " William said , his voice raw with tears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third venereal disease known as Chancroid . It is caused by Hemophilus ducreyi , frequently called a streptobacillus . Chancroid is an acute , localized disease , characterized in over half the cases by a bilateral bubo which develops in the groin . The diseasepresents itself as a vesicopustule or chancre , after a brief incubationperiod . This chancre is not to be confused with the Hunterian chancre , which is typical of syphilis . In general , Chancroid is a selflimitingdisease ; it will run its course , and its victim will enjoy a spontaneous cure . It is not gonorrhea , though the two are often confused . Yet Chancroid must not be taken lightly , for it often forms a partnershipwith a killer . Chancroid masks the presenting symptoms of its insidious partner , and is cordial to it . When Chancroid departs from the victim , the partner remains to invade , to inhabit , and ultimatelyto destroy .

Our most classic description of it comes from the pen of John Hunter , who , all unknowing , meticulously recordedfor us the opening events of the great tragedy of his life. )  |p327It  was to take three years before John Hunter considered himself free of the venereal poison . But at last the copper splotches on his trunk disappeared , and the tiny ulcer that had appeared on a tonsil departed , and the bubo in the groin melted away . After three years he felt himself in perfect health but for a bout of the gout that last spring . During those years his star had risen . He was elected to the staff of St. George 's , he took over William 's elegant house in Jermyn Street when William moved , and he bought himself a carriage and fine horses , and he purchased every strange animal or monster or subject that took his fancy , whatever the cost . In this space of time Joseph Banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He left with many promises to John to bring him all manner of strange fish and beasts . And Anne Home began a dreary waiting for a man who had neglected , in the bustle of his departure , to ask for her hand , or make any promises to her at all . In time , she grew convinced that he would never return.  |p328ON  a fair Sunday morning in July 1771 , a quiet ceremony took place in St. James 's Church , Westminster , joining in holy matrimony Anne Home and John Hunter , surgeon , F.R.S . Although the bride was twenty-nine years old , it was her first marriage , she not being a widow . Miss Home was the daughter of Robert Home , surgeon . The groom , Mr. Hunter , was on the staff of St. George 's Hospital , was a Fellow of the Royal Society , was the author of The Natural History of Teeth , a definitive work on a subject much misunderstood , and had served in His Majesty 's forces during the Seven Years War with much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had a fine little country residence in Earl 's Court where he maintainedan exceptional anatomical museum , as well as a most diverse menagerie . Attending the ceremony were Mr. and Mrs. Robert Mylne , Mr. Joseph Banks , F.R.S , newly returned to London after a miraculous four-year voyage with Captain Cook to the Great Southern Continent , and several house students of Mr. Hunter 's . Among other members of the bride 's family was her youngest brother , Mr. EverardHome , a king 's scholar of Westminster School . Dr. William Hunter , F.R.S , Physician-Extraordinary to the Queen , did not make his appearance , remaining that Sunday morning in his magnificent house and School in Great Windmill Street . Though the ceremony attracted little attention , those who didtake notice of it observed that Miss Home was bettering herself . The newly wedded Hunters planned to spend a few days at Earl'sCourt before returning to London and Jermyn Street . Both bride andp329groom were quiet and reserved during the wedding festivities . The groom had suffered , for the three springs preceding , strange attacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered from that which had felled him in the spring just past . The bride smiled little , it was noted , but she was a woman of a grave turn of mind , though when younger she had been most flighty and gay for a season or so . There was some mention that she was a poetess , though none could recall reading her works in print . On the ride to Earl 's Court , Mr. and Mrs. Hunter sat silent for the most part , their bodies touching only when the sway of the carriage tossed them against one another . The bride stared out the window , her eyes shadowed under the ponderous erection of her hairdress . The groom constantly turned his great coarse head towards her profile . He noted with a tender delight the transparency of her nostrils and the swanlike fragility of her neck holding upright its burden of her hair . When the carriage stopped before the doorway of the brick house at Earl 's Court , the groom hastened around on his short thick legs to help his bride alight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head lookingup almost directly from between his broad shoulders , he appeared , for one startling moment , to be a powerful dwarf on his knees , worshiping . Then the bride alighted , landing on her dainty feet with the dry scratching sound of a cat coming to rest lightly on all fours . She looked back at the coachman , he preparing to drive the carriage around to the stables , and made her first domestic remarkto her husband . " I can not see why you persist in having that pock-marked rogue about . " " I will dismiss him on the morrow , " the groom said , telling his first domestic lie . At the door the bride turned to survey her country home . On a fine lawn a pair of peacocks stood motionless near a fish pond . Over the bride 's head gaped the jaws of a crocodile appended above the front door , while to each side of her stood stone lions . To her right the bride could see the jutting expanse of her drawing room from whose opened windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left the house extended into a plain ell topped by an ominous smokestack , from which would belch the smoke and glow of burning flesh and bones . All around the bride 's country home there extended a sunken , covered cloister emitting a sour ammo/niacal odor and an occasional snarling cry . There the groom 's leopardsprowled in their captivity . From stables and other small structureshere and there about the grounds there came more sounds from savage throats , and from a barred mound at the edge of the lawn there came the bored dry cough of a dozing lion . Above the top of this mound ran a miniature redoubt or buttress boasting a small cannon . As the bride stood at her door , two servants appeared at this cannon , looking over at Mr. and Mrs. Hunter . The groom raised his arm , there was a puff of smoke from the gun , a boom that seemed to jar the quiet morning into a series of jolting scenes , shifting one after the other before the eye , and then a silence broken only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest , the leopards snarled , a bull bellowed somewhere , and scores of birds took flight from the trees . In the midst of all this the bride sighed . " Each time I see this place , I see it anew . Somehow I can not seem to familiarize myself with it . " She smiled wryly and offered her husband her hand . " Perhaps it is that I do not really believe such a fantastic place exists . " " No more , " said the groom gallantly , " than I can convince myself of the wonder of your standing here as my wife . " " Little wonder about that , " the bride said strangely , turning to enter her country house . In the cool dim interior , husband and wife stood accustoming their eyes . Gradually their gazes met , and the bride 's pale mouth began to tremble . The groom touched her cheek , letting his fingers trail down her breast to her slender waist . His voice was harsh with his attempt to speak softly and reassuringly . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . " I promise you , " he said , " that I will do all in my power to make you happy . " The bride said politely , " I am certain that you will , John , " and prepared her trembling mouth for his kiss . " For you are a good man , " she added as if in explanation of her permitting him to draw close . The groom now placed his hands on each side of the bride 's face . Against her pale cheeks his nails stood out , ridged , thickened , the stained rims giving the appearance , like the fingers of a butcher , of having been dipped in blood.  |p331John  awakened in the deep of the night to find the bedcurtains still parted . Bright moonlight streamed through the opened window to pour across the floor and the bed and himself , at last to lie like a glow rising from the crest of Anne 's bare hip . She was sleeping profoundly , the tumbled structure of her hair massed about her . Outside the window a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor danced . He could see , as he rose carefully on his elbow , that the night without was faintly luminous so that the wall at the edge of the lawn stood out whitely against the blue-black sky behind it . The aura seemed to come from the very earth itself ; there was a shimmering quality about the lawn and the wall and the tree , and his fish pond gleamed like a lidless eye . He had then the feeling of earth-shine , the sensation of the steady glow of the earth as it hung , motionless , in the endless night of the sky . A silence spread through him , a withholding and a waiting , as he turned to look down on Anne . He bent over her , brimming , to find her awake , his shadow spreading over her pale face and skin like a black stain . There was a faint cry in the night ; his leopards were mating.  |p332Midweek  , Mr. and Mrs. Hunter drove up to the door of their town house in Jermyn Street , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps awaiting them stood Mr. Hunter 's house students , a handful of shavelings who had come to the city to study for a year or so at one of the great hospitals and to dissect under Mr. Hunter when they were not walking the wards after him at St. George 's or attending the numerous other lectures being given about town . There were the usual pair of bumpkins , sons of country surgeons , a ' prentice or so in search of a theoretical veneer , and occasionally a lad with an M.D. fresh from Glasgow or even Oxford , who , for all his degrees , did not know the sterno-mastoid from the Achilles tendon . On this morning , the students grouped on the steps wearing doubtful smiles ; one could not be sure , even on such an auspicious occasion as this , in what mood the " dear man " ( as his students had come to call him ) might chance to be . Mr. Hunter , all smiles , dropped from the carriage and turned to give his hand to his bride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era , came to an end about fifty million years ago . " " I just ca n't take it in , " remarked Delphine Travis , breakingan oppressive silence amid the group of neighbors walkingtowards the lower end of Heron Pond . " If we 've gone back fifty million years , then our little community , on GumptionIsland , contains all the human life there is . How awful ! " " It 's a challenge , to say the least , " said her husband . " Reggie , what do you think of that plan of organization we adopted ? " " Well , I guess it 's all right for a start , " replied Colonel Showalter . " It 's going to be difficult to handle Internal Order and Security with scarcely any materiel ; more so if an enemy officer is given the run of the place and if there actually are sea serpents splashing about , which , mind you , I do n't for a minute personally admit .

We 've got to start getting seed into the ground right away ; and the ploughing , even for what seed we 've got , is going to take plenty of labor . " " Who are the other directors ? " asked Mary Showalter . " I ca n't recall all six now , but I did think they were good selections . " " There 's Caselli here for Public Works and Reconstruction , " said Walter . " Dr. Lawson for Health and Sanitation ; Father Brown for Morale and Education ; the Colonel for Order and Security ; myself for Agriculture . Let 's see , there 's one more . Oh , yes , Admiral Evans in charge of Fisheries and Navigation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio , " added Phil Baker , the quiet young chemist . " A lot depends on how he does his job . I suppose the first thing will be to decide whether people are conscripted for particular jobs , or allowed to volunteer . " " Of course we 'll conscript them , " exploded Colonel Showalter . " Ca n't organize an adequate defense with volunteers . I 'll need all the young men and the best shots in my Security Force ; certainly if these imaginary dinosaurs really are hanging around . Maybe some more Reds too ! First thing tomorrow we should work out a plan for trenches and barbedwireentanglements . " " If we had any barbed wire , " commented Tony . " Dr. Lawson has done a swell job already , " said Walter . " So have you , Tony , as Doggy emphasized . I guess we can all make bricks without straw , up to a point , if we can see each other 's problems . That 'll be up to Doggy . One advantageis that everybody likes him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Showalter . " But I think he 's soft . Not a resolute leader ; not the man for an emergency like this .

Are n't you pleased that we have no women directors , and that there was no discussion over the appointments , except to confirm by ayes and nays ? " " I heard two votes against my appointment , " said Caselli bitterly . " And I know who they were  --  Bryson and Norton , the same ones who always blackballed me for the club . " " Now , Tony , " admonished Delphine Travis . " Do n't bear malice . Some people ca n't adjust themselves overnight , and you 've got to give them time to come around .

If not , who pays their wages , and how ? " " Of course , we 'll draft them , " shouted the Colonel , quickeninghis pace . " It 's a national emergency , is n't it ? With the Bolshies bombing the hell out of us ! " " Reggie , dear , " remonstrated his wife , " you forget that 's fifty million years from now . Not even Roosevelt could have maintained a national emergency that long . " " Things are a bit confused , are n't they , " said Phil Baker . " Well , here 's where I turn off .

" " I 'll see that you get the assignment , " said Caselli , as he too turned into a darkened entrance . " Good night . " " Do n't forget that tomorrow is the Fourth of July , " called Colonel Showalter . " Double work for the holiday ! " " Walt , " said Delphine Travis , as her husband fumbled for the doorknob . " Liss Phillips told me tonight that this warm weather is bringing out their holly berries , bigger than ever before . Could n't we melt them down for candles , the way we used to do with bayberries on the farm ?

" I only wish I could take it as calmly as you do . " Goldenrod and her two sisters chewed contentedly on the hay with which John had filled their improvised mangers.  |p53He  placed the half-full pail beside another at the door of the former garage , slipped wooden covers over them , wiped the perspiration from his forehead , and looked through the gathering dusk to the north shore of Gumption Island . There it lay , seemingly lifeless , a quarter of a mile away across the now open channel that had been the sheltered harbor of the yacht squadron . Piles of neatly stacked bricks and timber marked the sites of the cottages on Bo'sun 's Row . On the inner side of the broken causeway , jutting out to within two hundred yards of where he stood , a rowboat lay beached . " Calm enough , " John mused , " but even so , it looks as though the boys would be late this evening . And their visits are the only excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Jenny so tense and nervous . " Clad in blue jeans , pretty , girlish , and graceful , his wife came round the corner of the battered house , carrying an empty milk bottle and a ladle . " I hope you got a good yield , tonight , Jack , " she said . " Will you fill this bottle before they come to collect ? " " Let me just rinse my sweaty hands in this water bucket . But that 's a quart bottle , Jenny . We 're only supposed to take a pint . " " Well , who 's going to tell the difference , if you fill it quick so I can put it away ? A pint a day is n't even enough for me to cook with , and you ought to have a glass at night before you go to bed , working over here like a horse , the way you do . To tell the truth , I 'd like some milk myself , right now . " " There 's 171 people on the island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting about six gallons a day from these three cows , and that 's all you can expect . It 's 48 pints of milk  --  a little better than a quarter of a pint apiece , daily , for young and old .

That 's a generous ration and I 'm not goingto take any more . " " Well , all I can say then , Jack , is more fool you . How 4 '  |p54about  the liquor stocks some of them people over there has got locked up ? Bryson and Venable and Phillips and Randolphand a lot of others too .

He told Bobby , and Bobby told me that , if people do n't come across voluntarily , the stuff will be taken anyhow . And we 're not bad off here  --  except for being so lonesome . They gave us plenty of canned food from the club . I guess you 'd rather have that than liquor , would n't you ? " " Caselli told Bobby , and Bobby told you , " mocked his wife . " Why , stuck over here , with just one no-account nigger boy to help out , we do n't even know what 's happening on the island . The only people we see are Bobby Macpherson and Perry Warren , when they row over for the milk . There they come now . Give me the pint then , and I 'll go down to the landing with you . " Measuring carefully , John ladled the bottle half full of creamy milk , then replaced its plastic cap and handed the allotment to his wife . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess any better than you , " he said , as they walked the few steps to the house . " I miss our TV something dreadful . We do n't even have the radio to fall back on , and no company at all . Jenny , why do n't you take up your piano playing again ? That 's a nice one in there and it do n't seem damaged any beyond those scratches , where the plaster was shook down . How do you like the way I fixed that front door ? " " It shuts tight now , I 'll say that . And it better had , if what those boys say about sea serpents is true . " Putting the milk bottle on the mantelpiece of the battered living room , Jenny turned to face her husband . " As for playingthe piano , " she said , " I might be getting round to that pretty soon . Anyhow , I 'll have to stop all this heavy outsidep55work I 've been doing . And maybe I 'll sometimes be even more mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't mean I love you less . " The startled foreman eyed his wife closely . " Why , Jenny , " he cried , " are you telling me you 're pregnant ? Then we will have to move back to our own house , and quick . Why did n't you say so sooner  --  before I told Walter Travis I 'd come over to this dump and look after the stock ? Of course , I would n't have done it if I 'd known . I was beginning to think we never would have a baby . You know  --  all this talk about radioactive fall-out making people sterile . Say , this is going to cheer up everybody . You ai n't kidding , are you ? We 'll go right down and tell the boys ! Then they can tell Dr. Lawson and tomorrowWalter could send Bill Jefferson over to replace me . " Jenny smiled . " Take your foot off the gas , Jacky boy , " she said . " Sure I 'm kidding , but not the way you mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know myself . And do n't forget it 's only a fortnight since that bomb was dropped . I do n't mean to tell nobody else till I see the doctor , but I do think that ought to be pretty soon . Having a baby on the island now wo n't be no picnic . " Gathering Jenny in his arms , John Stokes tilted her chin back and kissed her passionately . " I 'll fix you that extra pint from now on , " he said . " Oh , Jacky , " she whispered . " I do n't really want you to chisel . But I had a real hankering for one good glassful . " The sound of footsteps on the path outside pulled them apart . " Hey , there , Stokeses , " shouted a boyish voice . " How about those six gallons you promised for tonight ? Let 's get moving ! Perry and I do n't want to spill it in the dark . " " All right , Bobby , " said John , emerging happily from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before it 's spilled . I 've actually got nearly four gallons . Goldenrod is making records . And not the only one around here , either . " " Perry just ran over to your hot spring to sterilize the pails we brought back , " said Bobby Macpherson . " He'llp56carry the new milk to the boat . We 're late . The Committee was sitting and asked me to wait so I could tell you what they decided about you and Jenny and Billy Watson . " " I do n't get you , Bobby , " said John , as they walked downhillto where the Gumption Island gatehouse once stood . " What did they have to decide about us ? " " They 're going to bring the cattle and sheep over to the island tomorrow . The plan is to pasture them on the first fairway of the golf course , close to the clubhouse . Since Perry and I saw that plesiosaurus , or whatever it was , this islet of yours seems a bit remote . Moreover , when the weather 's bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across anyway . " " That 's going to be some job , Bobby . Of course , I 'm glad for Jenny and me . And the sheep wo n't give no trouble . But how do you plan to move them cattle , most especially Buster ? He 's a right lively bull , for a youngster . " " Well , cowboy , that 's one for you to lasso . We 're going to have the big launch over here at seven o'clock , with AdmiralEvans and a couple of husky darkies . You do n't often have a retired rear admiral of the United States Navy ferryingcattle , Jack . You ought to feel proud . " " One ferried me and a lot of others just about like cattle over to Europe in the last war . " " Speaking of Europe , of course you might swim Buster over , " observed Bobby , as they reached the shore , where Perry Warren was stowing the covered milk pails in the stern of the rowboat . " Perry , could you play Europa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white teeth gleamed . " Some folks is so good at throwin ' the bull , " he laughed , " that they should n't need to swim him over . " " That 's one back for you , Bobby , " said Jack Stokes , shovingthe boat offshore as the white youth settled to the oars . " But throwing , or swimming , or riding in an admiral 's barge  --  Buster ai n't going to like it nohow . See you at seven tomorrow , boys . I 'll have the morning milking done by then . " P57Toddy Baker held a spoonful of porridge at arm 's length and eyed it gravely . " I saw a nairplane yesterday , " she remarked casually . " Now , darling , eat your porridge and do n't talk nonsense , " said her mother . " Heaven knows it 's difficult enough to get the fresh milk you and Budge need . Do n't go spilling any of it now . Where do you think you saw this airplane ? " " I do n't think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouted Toddy . " I saw it when I was playing on the beach . It was out over the Bay  --  a long way out . " " It must have been a sea gull , " said Mrs. Baker . " Toddy , you do n't ever go near the water when you 're down on the beach , do you ? Remember , it 's not like it used to be . Those big waves could hurt and , if I 'm working in the kitchen , I ca n't see you . I wonder now why we ever put the kitchen in the front of the house . " " I do n't go as near the water as Budge does . But it 's more fun when he 's there , too . I do n't like playing alone . Ca n't Budge go down to the beach with me this morning ? " " Yes , dear ; he can for a little while . He 's much better now and it 'll be good for him out there in the sunlight . I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you 've finished your porridge , you can both go down together , at least while I clean up the breakfast things . Remember that tomorrow you go back to school . Miss Buchanan is well again . " " You should call her teacher , " said Toddy . " Everybody calls her teacher , except Polly , and he calls her Mad . She does n't ever get mad , though . " " That dreadful Communist , " muttered Mrs. Baker . " Where do you see him ? " she asked . " He comes to school every day to take teacher home . He says she must n't walk through the woods alone . It is n't safe . " " I do n't think that 's the real reason he comes for her . What is there in the woods , any worse than he was ? Why , here 's Budgy boy ! All dressed and his sneaker strings tied up so neatly . Good old Budget ! Now you can play on the beach for a little while with Toddy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay well back yourself , too . If you get your feet wet , back to bed you go . " " I 'm seven and Toddy is five , so I can go two feet nearer the water than she can . Teacher says that 's subtraction . " " She 's five and you 're seven , so you must both stay twelve feet away from the nearest water , and I say that 's addition . " " You could be a teacher yourself , Mums , if the real one gets sick again . " " The important thing is that you do n't get sick again . Now run along , kiddies . I 've got to wash the dishes and then I 'll be out working in the garden where I can see you . Daddy said he 'll be home to help me this afternoon . This morning , they 'll finish the last of the clean-up at Bo'sun 's Row . Thank goodness that job is over . " Through the Baker 's pine-dotted shore front , allotted wholly to melons by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the beach , was only a minute 's run . Soon the children were happily digging in the soft hot sand , well away from the gentle surf . " You did n't see no airplane yesterday really , did you , Toddy ? " asked Budge , after a time . " I do n't think there 's been any airplanes since the ' splosion . It must have blown them all up . " " Oh yes , I did see a nairplane , " Toddy insisted . " It was way out there . . . . Why there , stupid , there it is again ! " Budge stood up , shading his eyes . " That 's a funny airplane , " he said . " Its wings go up and down , like a bird . It 's not very big , though . Maybe it 's a Thunderjet , from An-napolis . " " It 's getting bigger all the time , " said Toddy . " That 's because it 's coming this way . I 'm going to tell Mummy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " " You 'd better run , Toddy , and get out of the way . It 's coming down . I think it 's going to land on the beach , right about here . " It was indeed swooping down fast , directly towards the children . But for all the huge wingspread , of twenty feetp59or more , it was no airplane . The long neck , and open jaws with knifelike teeth , were all too clearly natural , and purposeful . " Toddy , run ! run ! It 's not an airplane . It 's a dragon . It 's going to eat us . Run quick to Mummy ! " Terrified , the little ones pounded through the slippery sand towards the steps . Toddy , starting well in advance , gained safety . Budge , looking over his shoulder at the awful apparition , caught his foot on a piece of driftwood , fell in a plump , pathetic , helpless heap . The great membranous wings rattled as the creature swooped in . Their shadow darkened the sandy playground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hissing sound burst from the crocodile jaws and a nauseating reptiliansmell assailed the children 's nostrils . As Budge , shrieking , got to his feet , the great jaws closed around his middle , and a twist of the muscular neck jerked him from the ground . The wings beat down , touching the sand , whirling it away in eddying clouds . Then , rising sluggishly under the weight of its prey , the monster circled over the heedless breakers , and out to sea . " Oh , Mummy , Mummy , " wailed Toddy . " A smelly dragon airplane has taken Budge . Oh , Mummy , Mummy , where are you ? "  | " THERE 'S ANOTHER red canasta , and I 'll go out , " said Elise Bryson , laying down her cards . " It makes game so easily I do n't think it 's worth scoring . Helen , the boys will think twice before they challenge us again . How about a drink , to cele-brate ? " " Wonderful , if it 's not cutting into your stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cloisonne box tendered by her hostess . Kenneth Bryson , slim , glossy haired and gallant , snapped his silver lighter for the ladies , used it himself , and then rose to strike smartly on a little hand bell beside the candelabra on the mantelpiece . " We 've got plenty , for the right people , " he said . " According to the priest , this is July 18 , which happens to be my forty-fifth birthday . Good reason for a drink . " " I scarcely believe you , " demurred Helen . " Why , you have n't a gray hair ! You must be using that Sicilian restorativeof Basil Agonistes ' . What 's its fancy name ? " " Basilicon No. 12 , " laughed Bryson . " Yes , I bought a dozen bottles . It 's no fake , Helen . Basil says he can go on making it here  --  from laurel leaves . " A colored butler , immaculately garbed , came silently out of the dark hall , halting respectfully in the doorway . " Four juleps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those caviar appetizers I told you to prepare , " his wife added . " Yes , ma'am . " Robert cleared his throat . " Beg pardon , Mr. Bryson , but you remember there 's no ice , sir ? " The banker 's geniality gave way to sudden irritation.  | " Damnation , " he snapped . " Well , bring us scotch and plain water , then . It 'll be quicker , anyhow . " " I do n't wonder , " said Dick Norton , " that you forget the fix we 're in , with this lovely house practically undamaged and the style you manage to maintain . " He looked enviously around the softly lighted room . " How are you going to keep Robert and Sarah ? " " That opens up something I wanted to discuss with you , Dick . I 've already mentioned it to Elise , but I do n't think she fully understands . However , the four of us ought to get it clear , right now . Everything that makes life worth living is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kenneth , " said his wife . On a big silver tray the soft-footed butler carried in a decanter of whiskey , water in a crystal pitcher , highball glasses to match , and a Limoges plate of tiny crackers covered with caviar . Deftly he cleared the card table , spread an embroidered linen cover , arranged the refreshments , and looked inquiringly at his employer . " That 's all , Robert , " said Bryson . " Just see that Roger is off his chain before you and Sarah go up , and make sure the back door is locked . " So far , they do n't realize that it 's anything more than an earthquake or some other transient disaster , " he continued , as the door closed . " Indeed , Sarah told Elise only this morning they 're saving more money than ever before . They have n't got around to wondering what they 're saving for . But , of course , they soon will . " " You must have had a lot of cash on hand , " commented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the nearly four weeks since the bombing . " " I was planning to fly from Friendship to Chicago the morning after Labor Day , " explained Bryson . " I guess I had a thousand in my wallet . But Robert would just as soon take my check each week , so far as that goes . The real question is , how can I keep it that way ? To put it generally : how do we stay on a credit economy ? "  | " Doggy tells me the Directorate is discussing money , " said Dick . " I gather they have n't reached any conclusion . Caselli wants labor certificates  --  one unit for each hour of communal work . These to be exchangeable at the canteen at fixed prices as long as the club has anything to sell . Caselli also suggests that the club use these certificates to buy what individuals have to offer  --  like wood and eggs from Phillips , or apples and cantaloupes from Buchanan  --  and so gradually establish a market . I confess I do n't see any long-range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " exclaimed Mrs. Norton . " He wants to make the club a market and he 's not even a member ! " " I 'm afraid that fight 's lost , Helen , " said Bryson . " But there 's a bigger one coming up . Do n't you see that Caselli 's idea is essentially communistic ? It 's the sort of scheme this Russian officer would sponsor ; and maybe he does , for all I know . Buchanan and several others treat him like an old college chum . " " Well , what 's your suggestion ? " asked Norton . " I start from the fact that I 'm a bank president and that Robert is my butler . I 'm a good banker and he 's a good butler , but we did n't achieve our respective positions accidentally . As a result of competition  --  or call it survival of the fittest  --  I normally make in an hour as much as Robert makes in a week . That 's as it should be , because it measures the greater economic value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's only a glorified laborer himself , proposes that henceforth one hour of Robert 's work should be the equivalentof one hour of my work . If that is n't communism , I do n't know the name for it . " " I do n't like it either , Ken . But you 've got to remember where we are  --  or when we are , if all this Mesozoic stuff is real . " " That awful thing that flew off with little Budge Baker two days ago was real enough , " said Mrs. Bryson . " Sure , that was terrible , Elise . But do n't weaken our case by sentimentality . Children get killed by automobiles everyp63day and we do n't think that 's any reason for going communist . I know what Dick has in mind . He 's about to say that , under conditions on Gumption Island now , my training as a banker and his as a broker are worthless . Value now rests in ability to dig dirt , or milk cows , or build dykes . Therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-won experience . Is that right , Dick ? " " That 's about what I was thinking , " admitted Norton disconsolately . " Well , just remember that the big majority of people left on this island are in our position . What market is there now for Randolph 's knowledge of the oil industry , for Phillips ' newspaper training , for Dr. Adler 's familiarity with Sanskrit , or for old McArdle 's skill at golf ? It 's not just bankers and brokers that could be out of luck here . We 're all that way except the laborers , and Caselli suggests that we get down and grub it out along with them . That 's not my pigeon . I 'm not going to change my ways . " " You have n't yet said what you propose . " " I propose that we utilize the instrument of credit , which you and I understand . I propose , in brief , that we set up a Gumption Island bank , with all the functions , so far as we need them here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , it will be the National Bank of Gumption Island , empowered to issue bank notes against reserves . You and I will run it , and we 'll soon get a productive economy going without plantingany potatoes ourselves . The reserves , on which we wo n't ever need to draw , will be securities owned by the directors , and those of us who put up those securities will take the new bank stock in proportion . " " But we do n't have those securities here , or at least I do n't , " Norton objected . " What does that matter ? No bank ever keeps any substantialpart of its reserves in its own vaults . Say we decide our reserve here should be $250,000 . Then you and I each pledge $50,000 in securities we own  --  or say we own . As a matter of policy  --  to spread it around  --  we 'll get DoggyP64Venable and two others to do the same . It 's really immaterial where or what those securities are , but we can call them shorttermgovernments . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million , at the start . Then we create legal tender up to 50 per cent of that . Then we make loans , at fair interest  --  say five per cent  --  and we 're off . We 'll get one of the lawyers  --  Murion would be best  --  to join us and draw up a formal charter . Dick , what do you think ? " " There are a lot of implications , " said Norton slowly . " There sure are , " Bryson agreed . " And I guess it 's too late to take them all up now . But the main point is that in this way , and this way only , we keep the relatively good position to which experience and ability entitle us . You sleep on it , Dick ; then come round and talk details with me in the morning . I can run this bank all right . But I need to sell the idea to everyone who does n't like the thought of labor certificates ; to everyone who does n't like being put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see the main point , okeh , " said Norton , rising with his wife . " And I think you 've got something . It 's clever . But there 'll be criticism . What time shall I come around ? " " By eight , if that 's not too early ? " " No , I 'll have had my Sunday breakfast then , such as it is . And I 'll still be able to keep a golf appointment at ten o'clock . Many thanks for the drink , Ken . " " It was delicious , and such a treat , " added his wife . Bryson patted her pretty , bare shoulder . " You get Dick working with the golfers for this plan of mine , " he said paternally , " and it wo n't be the last drink you 'll have here  --  not by a long sight ! " " It 's a picture to watch you play that waterhole , " said Bill Brady . In single file , the foursome was crossing the narrow plank bridge leading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the lead , softened a little at the corn/pliment . " The distance is just made for number five , " he said . " You ought n't ever miss the green if you handle your mashie right . " " Well , I can miss it , as just demonstrated , " grumbled Dick Norton . " One in the drink and the second in the bunker . " " Mac said if , ' " jibed Roy Wilson . " So the conclusion is obvious . " The steep climb on the far side of the marshy inlet preventedany rejoinder . At the top , the small square of green disclosed two white balls , one within a yard of the flag . " A lovely shot , Mac , " said Bill , as the less fortunate players separated to search the sand pits to right and left . The old pro , panting a little from the climb , selected his putter , dropped the bag of clubs , and looked out to the north . Across the road beneath them lay the tidy ruins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lumber stacked neatly beside the foundations of the vanished cottages . Beyond lay the still comparatively sheltered water of the empty harbor . The wind blew fresh from the northeast and the thunder of surf on the bar formed by the sunken causeway was plainly audible . " So far as the golf is concerned , we 're really lucky , " said McArdle . " Give me a little help , Mr. Brady , and I can keep these greens in quite good shape . Of course , we 've lost the first hole to those damned sheep , and all the fairways are going to pieces , but they never were what they should have been . Anyway , most people here like to play winter rules . " There was a soft plop as another ball fell on the green , followed by the stocky figure of Dick Norton , in khaki shorts and gaudy sports shirt . From the far bunker came an earthy thud , and stormy ob j urgations in Roy Wilson 's deep bass voice . " Nice recovery , " commented Brady approvingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dick , I think you 'd bettertell Mac what you were telling me . He was just saying that with a little help he could keep these greens playable . " " I 'm afraid not , Mac , " said Norton slowly , joining themby the flag . " I ran into Walter Travis on the road early thisp66morning and he gave me bad news . I was n't going to tell you till we 'd finished our round . I 'm afraid it 's the last one that will be played on Gumption Island . " In shocked silence McArdle looked inquiries , his yellowing teeth clenched on a stubby , unlighted pipe . A shower of sand and a grunt came from the far bunker , together with another golf ball which landed sluggishly at their feet . " Walter says the greens are all to be dug up tomorrow , " continued Norton . " He plans to plant them in fruit trees . " " In fruit trees ? " gasped McArdle incredulously . " What 's the point ? Where 's he going to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good waste land there is on this forsakenisland ? " " Not trees exactly , but seedlings . Walter has been experimenting with all sorts of seeds  --  orange and lemon pips , and grapefruit in addition to the figs and things he 's always grown . Now he finds them all sprouting in his various pots and pans . He 's made a collection of every available fruit seed on the island and he says the golf greens are the best places for developing small orchards . " As the old golf pro stood visibly trembling , Roy Wilson joined the trio . " I 'm five already , " he grumbled . " Why do n't you fellows finish it up ? What 's the matter , Mac ? I feel badly enough about my golf without having you stare at me that way ! " " They 're going to take my greens to plant fruit trees , " groaned McArdle . " Mr. Wilson , you 've been playing here for years . You 're chairman of the golf committee . Are you going to let them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being considered , " said Roy . " Walter Travis came around and talked to me last night . For a long time he 's grown tropical fruits in his little greenhouse . When that was smashed , he put the plants outdoors and they 're thriving . So now he wants the greens for orchards , because they 're already cleared and fertilized and get good sunlight . He said he 's already proved that six types of tropical fruit will grow here , and he wants three greens for each of the six.  |p67While  they 're maturing , he 'll plant melons and squash and cucumbers around them . " " It 's not so much what they 're doing as the way they 're doing it , " expostulated Norton . " Golf is about the only pleasure some of us have left . Before they bust that up , it ought to be put to a vote . This Emergency Committee just orders anything the way it wants . What we 've got is dictatorship ! " " I 'll bet that damn priest has a finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't even belong on the island . Of course he 'd like to take my greens , just because I 'm Presbyterian . He ca n't play himself , not with those silly flapping skirts . So lie does n't want anybody else to play either . He even suggestedI should go to church Sundays  --  the only day anybody dares play golf now . " " Oh , come , Mac , " said Bill Brady . " Do n't get religion into this . I 'm a Catholic by birth myself , and I do n't like it either . I think Dick is right in saying a decision of this sort ought to be debated first . If it was put up to me as necessary , I 'd probablygo along . But I 'd like to have some say in the matter . I do n't Iike to be pushed about . " " We 're continually pushed about , " interjected Norton . " This bunch on top wants to make us work like niggers . It 's all very fine for Walter Travis to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when it comes to the digging and ditching , he 'll be boss and we 'll do the work . I bet , Mac , they 'll turn you from a pro into a gardener . That 's what you started as , is n't it ? " " Yes , " agreed McArdle , " my old governor was a gardener all his life , back in Perthshire . He wanted me to do better for myself and was a time I thought I had . What are those six tropical fruits Mr. Travis wants to plant ? " " He named them , " said Wilson . " Let 's see : oranges , lemons , grapefruit , avocados , bananas . There was one more . Oh , yes , papaya ! " " I did n't know bananas had seeds , " commented Brady . " Of course they have , " exclaimed McArdle . " You gen/erally eat them before they 've had time to form . I recall when I was a bairn , my dad raised bananas from seed in the big conservatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about growing bananas in Scotland . " " Well , " persisted Norton , " as I say , the kick is against the way things are being handled . There may be an argument for this particular scheme , but if we do n't make a stand soon we 're all going to be ordered around like slaves . The idea of this directorate is just to tell the majority what to do . That's. not democracy . For instance , take the subject of money . Who 's going to decide what to do about that ? " " Gentlemen , " said the old pro , " if you do n't mind , I 'd like to call off our game . I want to go back to my room and think about this . Then I 'd like to see those seedlings . These greens are good soil , but we ought to muck it up a bit before plantingtropical fruit . " " Here 's a better plan , " suggested Norton hurriedly . " I met up with Ken Bryson this morning and he proposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe he 's got some ideas along the lines we 've been talking about and we could just as well go back there now . " " I could sure do with a drink , " admitted McArdle . The others nodded assent . " So ordered , " said Norton briskly . " Let 's go , then . The weather 's really too sticky for golf anyhow ! " With a big aluminum serving spoon , Sam Turner rapped smartly on the bottom of the frying pan lying on the table before him . " This yere convention , " he announced portentously , " will kindly come to order . " The buzz of conversation in the club kitchen tapered off . A semicircle of dark faces focused expectantly on the portly chairman 's white coat of office . With simple dignity , his glance swept slowly around the arc of the little gathering . " They 's twenty-four of us present , " he said , " counting me . That means only two abstainers . One is George Garvey , in thep69infirmity with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has yo ' wife got good reason for her abstinence ? " The Brysons ' butler rose respectfully . " Yes , Mr. Chairman , " he replied . " We considered as how we both should n't be away from work at once . Sarah 's preparing dinner now and I take this opportunity to inform the chair that in one hour I must be back to serve it . " " Ai n't no must about it , " grumbled a husky fellow clad only in undershirt and dirty overalls . " Bill Jefferson , " reprimanded the chairman , " you is out of order . Mr. Secretary , please record Sarah Delancey 's abstinenceas certified . Sister Banks , will you please to call a blessing on this convention ? " Ponderously , Sadie Banks heaved her 250 pounds erect . " O Lord , " she said , with closed eyes and uplifted glistening face , " help us Thy people to understand Thy will and act according . Grant to us wisdom to understand the white folks ' ways . O Lord , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of they skin . Help us as Thou helped the Israel children in the wilderness of snakes and scorpens . Help us to carry the cross humbly and widout fuss and fret as did Thy son , Jesus Christ . Amen . " Breaking the pause that followed , Bill Jefferson rose from his front row seat . " Ah guess you ai n't gwine to call me out o ' order now , Sam , " he said truculently . " You has the floh , Bill , " conceded the chairman . " And since you and Abe and Steve requested me to call this convention , you kin properly appropriate the time to explain yoh troubles . " " It ai n't especially my troubles , Sam , " said the big field worker slowly , " any mo ' than it 's yo ' troubles , or the troubles o ' any o ' the rest of us . Plain fact is , we 're all up against a dirty white man 's trick to make us slaves again . " With unconscious skill the speaker paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ah ai n't had schoolin ' like some o ' you Baltimore people . But we ai n't all fools just because we do n't understan ' about money and banks and highfalutinp70high finance . It 's the feeling of all us maintenance men that , even after this ' splosion , Mr. Bryson and his crowd aims to live high while we sweat our guts to get things straight . And we think you clubhouse barflies is ready to fall for that dirt . " Something as near to a flush as his skin permitted swept the chairman 's cheeks . " You do n't make no friends and you do n't win no votes with sech insults , Bill Jefferson , " he said sharply . " As for Mr. Bryson , I consider him a real gentle-man . " " He is a real gentleman , " affirmed Robert . " I 've been his butler for most ten years . He pays well , he pays easy , and he never talks insulting like you , Bill Jefferson . Funny how when a man collects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The chairman banged the frying pan fiercely . " Lemme make plain this am a convention and no low-down free-forall , " he shouted . " We do n't want to look down on nobody , white or black , fo ' what they does . We wants to look up to them fo ' what they is . Abe Lincoln , you do n't need to jesticulateso . I 'll give you the floh , but no more of this coarse ad hominy talk , if you please ! " The kinky redheaded mulatto , easily the best mechanic on the island , spoke haltingly . " I do n't handle words smooth like Bill Jefferson , " he said . " But I know as well as he do that this notice they posted is a trap . That idea of Mr. Caselli  --  those labor certificates  --  that made sense . But not this bank business . That do n't mean you get paid for what you does . It mos ' prob'ly means you loses what you gets . My mammy lost all her savings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traps , and this here proposition . . . we think it 's mo ' of a trap than most . " The headwaiter took a paper from his pocket . " Without embarrassment to nobody , " he said , " I apprehend that not every member of this convention reads easy . So I copies that notice careful and figure to read it now for expostulation . Anybody object ? "  | " That 's real nice of you , Sam , " said Sadie Banks . " Ah do n't make head or tail of what they tells me it says . I asked Mrs. Crashaw , but she 's mo ' fuddled than me . She most always is . " " On a point of personal privilege , " interpolated Perry Warren , " I want it understood that I ai n't no barfly jes ' because I tended the bar . " " You am the barfly to bar all barflies , " retorted Abe . " The way you sucks up to white folks ! " " Gemmen and ladies , " shouted the chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these pussonal recremations . Now this here notice "  --  he flourished the paper and adjusted his spectacles  --  " is entitled Notice ' . Then it reads : To facilitate community organization on Gumption Island it is proposed that a bank be established , empoweredto issue currency , make loans , discount negotiablepaper , and otherwise perform , so far as feasible and appropriate , all normal banking operations . While the idea has obvious merit the question of how the necessary capital shall be raised has caused sharp dissension . The Emergency Committee will meet on Saturday , August 1 , new style , to draw up a recommendation for submission to a public gathering one week later . All who are interested should express their opinions to any member of the Emergency Committee before August 1 . " " That 's real pretty reading , " said Sadie , " but Ah still do n't understan ' most of it . What 's this currency they wants to issue ? " " Currency is jes ' money , you goop ! " " Then why not say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to count , and what 's this capital they 's going to raze ? I thought Washington was the capital , and I bet that bomb already razed it ! " " Sadie , " said the chairman , " you is estimable , but you isP72not educated . Capital is money you puts into a bank so you can draw it out . They call Washington the same thing becausethat 's whah yo ' taxes go and then , from that capital , eventual you gets yo ' money back in social security . It 's a big way of doing what a bank does small . Capital means somethin ' extra special , like when they hangs you it 's called capitalpunishment . " " That ai n't necessarily so , " contradicted Bill Jefferson . " This here capital is the extra money rich folks has but do n't need . So they loans it out at interest to get mo ' money from them as has to borrow . Banks is jes ' the mechanism to loan that money an ' collet ' that interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Banks is a part of capitalism which is all a smart white folks way to keep you down while sayin ' you is free . " Sam Turner scratched his wooly head . " Well , this conventionai n't met to discuss economical details , " he parried . " These maintenance boys , they thinks we ought to tell the Emergency Committee that the colored help is against the whole idea of a bank . They asked inc to call this convention to adopt a resolution ' bout that . Does I hear a motion of entertainmentfor the chair ? " " Not yet you does n't ! " exclaimed Abe Lincoln . " We also said they ought to be a colored man on that Emergency Committeeand we ought to choose him ourselves . So I nominates Bill Jefferson ! " " But you'se out of order again , " protested the chairman . " You has forgot the previous question : does we or does we not want to protest this bank  --  lock , stock and barrel ? Who is agin the bank will raise his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot up . " And who is fo ' the bank , of co'se if properly run , will raise his right hand . " Fifteen hands were raised . " That 's fifteen to eight fo ' the bank , " Sam summarized . " The vote of the convention is favorable , but it takes a twothirdsvote to make a legal quorum . As chairman I could pro/vide that quorum by voting fo ' the bank myself . But I prefers to point out that Billy Watson votin ' fo ' and Estelle Jeffersonvotin ' no is both below the age of consent and cancels out . That makes it fo'teen to seben fo ' the bank , an ' you ca n't never veto a two-thirds quorum . " " You'se as full of tricks as Mr. Bryson hisse'f , " shouted Abe Lincoln angrily . " Now is you or is you ai n't goin ' to be fair and vote Bill Jefferson onto the Emergency Com-mittee ? " " That am a delicate parliament question , " commented the chairman thoughtfully . " Without contempt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To avoid acrimonia , the chair rules fo ' me to take that up mahse'f , at the chair 's discrimination . Robert , I see yo 's chafing to get back to Sarah and yo ' other duties . This yere convention stands adjourned ! " Henry Lawson laid his stethoscope on the table and gave his patient a friendly smile . " You 're right as a trivet now , " he said . " I only wish my ticker were half as good . " " High time for him to get to work , " growled Colonel Showalter . " There 's a lot of heavy duty he can do , under proper guard , of course . " " Oh , Polly is n't lazy , " said Bruce Buchanan . " He 's been most helpful round the house here and , next to George Garvey , I 'll bet he 's the best cook on the island . You 're going to have some of his borsch for supper . " " You 're taking a risk , Buck , " warned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food he prepares ? " Even without his shirt there was dignity in the Russian aviator 's rejoinder . " Colonel Showalter , " he said , " that is not how officer speaks , nor gentlemens . When you retired as one , did you also stop the other ? " The colonel flushed . " You impertinent Communist skunk , " he shouted , " you 'd better not forget you 're a P.W. , subject to any discipline I care to impose as commandant on this island . "  | " I forget nothing , " retorted the Russian , " least of all insultsto my great country . " " Now , now , gentlemen , " Buchanan cut in . " Is n't all this rather silly , considering our situation ? Polly , according to my niece , you have good manners . We regard you as a guest in our house and you have no right to talk to Colonel Showalter  --  another guest  --  like that . And , Reggie , the same goes for you ; even more so , because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the way you coddle this Commie , " expostulatedthe colonel . " And you talk about our situation . Did n't he put us here  --  by his own admission  --  dropping that fiendish bomb ? " ' fhat 's unworthy of you , Reggie , " said Dr. Lawson . " Have n't we dropped quite a few bombs , hither and yon , in recent years ? Are you going to hold it against Commander Polyvanov personally that the Russians got in under our guard ? " " No , " admitted the colonel slowly . " I do n't do that . It 's really the fault of those Pentagon bunglers in the first instance , and of course it 's Roosevelt 's fault fundamentally . But all the same , I ca n't patiently listen to this Red boasting about his lousy Russian system . And frankly , Buck , I do n't think you should expose your niece to all that subversive stuff . She 's too young to know her own mind . She might believesome of it . " " I think Madeleine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the young lady in question , from the doorway . " What are you men shouting about ? I could hear you all the way out in the kitchen , and if your cocktails are weak , as well as warm , it 's because you rattled me with all this row . Polly , have you forgotten what I told you just this morning ? " " No , Miss Madeleine , " said the Russian , taking the tray of drinks from her . " I remember everything you tell me . " " Well , what did she tell you ? " snapped Colonel Showalter . " She told me , " replied Polyvanov slowly , " that I must make allowances for you because you are an old man who hasp75lost his only son , for which I am personally very sorry . " He clicked his heels and bowed punctiliously . " God bless my soul , " choked Colonel Showalter . " Is that meant as an apology ? " " It is my expression of personal regret to you , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not necessarily expressviewpoints of my government . " " For heaven 's sake , stop all this nonsense , " cried the doctor . " Polly , your government wo n't even be established for fifty million years , more or less . And speaking of government , Buck , we 've just got to work out some intelligent procedureof our own here on the island , without worrying about either Moscow or Washington . All I know about Polly is that his broken ribs are healed and he 's fit to do any ordinary physical work . That was my job and it 's done . But there 's a lot bigger job coming up  --  to get a better way of running things . I do n't want to see any repetition of the row the Directorate had over Bryson 's bank scheme . " " I thought you were almost unanimous against it , " said Buchanan . " We were , " agreed the doctor . " In the showdown , there was only one who voted for the jip . But the point is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colored folks . Sam Turnertells me some of them are angry because they supported the bank and then did n't have any representative to speak for it . " " I do n't see why the Negroes should be represented as Negroes , " said the colonel . " That 's not what democracy means . " " I do n't see why Negroes should be excluded as Negroes , " protested Madeleine . " That 's not what democracy means . " " If you will excuse my having opinion , " said Polyvanov , " democracy and dictatorship are not opposed . In fact , dictatorshipof the proletariat is democracy . " " And if you have a chance , will you advance that argumentto Bill Jefferson and others ? " inquired the colonel . " I need advance no arguments for communism , " repliedp76the Russian coldly . " Its merits are self-evident . In time , they will be accepted by all . " " We hold these truths to be self-evident , ' " quoted Madeleine . " That remark , Polly , comes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " considering that seven weeks ago your bomb blew us out of all recognized time . And apropos of that , Madeleine , I do n't want to hurry you , but we really ought to be leaving soon . I do n't like these woods at night , not even with that peashooter on Reggie 's hip . Moreover , I have to go slow , with my bad heart . " " Supper 's all ready in the kitchen , " said the girl . " Such as it is . Polly , will you light your new candles ? " " What a quaint shape , " exclaimed the colonel , as the Russiantook a burning splinter from the fireplace and held it to the top of a fat , red , conical object on the mantel . " But why waste its little beam on us ? It 's not really dark yet . " " Oh , Polly 's made a dozen of them already , " said Buchanan . " He thinks he could make it a business and supplythe whole Island . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " From boiled down holly berries , " explained Madeleine . " He uses an old gasoline funnel as the mold . Runs a string through it for wick , blocks the spout with clay and then pours the liquid in . It cools into quite a good wax , and the sloping side catches the guttering . We call them P.J.H. 's  --  Polly 's Jolly Hollies . " " Well , I 'll be damned , " said the colonel . " Say , Mary certainlywould like some P.J.H. 's . Could I order half a dozen , do you think ? " " I shall delight to give you six of my candles , " said Polyvanov . " If you will honor parole I have already given as ranking officer of U.S.S.R. " " Let 's eat , " said Bruce Buchanan hastily . " Polly , do you mind taking those glasses out to the kitchen ? " " It is great pleasure , " said Wing Commander Polyvanov , graciously.  |p77TOM  PHILLIPS STOOPED and extracted another twig from the clogged blades of his lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new-cut grass around the house and the much greater stretch of tangled overgrowth that had been lawn two months earlier . Throwing his bare shoulders back to take the stiffness out of them , the editor felt in the hip pocket of his dirty shorts , pulled out an empty pipe , uttered a mild curse , and put it back . " You 'll never finish cutting the grass that way , " remarked his wife from the flower bed by the screened porch . " Do n't forget you 've got to thin those vegetables today ; your tobaccopatch too , if you want any results . And here 's something I really wish you 'd do for me . " Repressing a groan , Tom walked over to where Alicia , in soiled blouse and khaki pants , was weeding in the gay growth of petunias , nasturtiums , and cosmos . A basket full of waste vegetation gave evidence of her energy . " If you want a change of pace , " she continued , " just dump this stuff on the compost pile . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her husband stooped again , tugging the instrument from its position close to the roots of an iris clump . The prongs , pulled to the surface , still held a small , limp body transfixed . Raising it to his face Phillips sniffed . " Fresh as a daisy , " he said . " Want a spicy morsel for that stew ? " " No , no , Tom ! " protested Alicia . " We 're not that far gone yet . Frog 's legs I do n't mind . And I might go along with Basil Agonistes right up to those big snails on the ivy . But notp78moles , Tom ! You might as well eat mice . Put it on the compostpile too  --  please ! " " After I 've skinned him , " amended the editor hopefully , snapping open the big blade of his boy scout knife . " We ca n't afford to waste any more good material like moleskin . That'lI make a first-class patch for my blue jeans , where they 're goingat the knee . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think you 'd much better get on with the grass . There are still plenty of odds and ends for patches in my workbox . " " It is n't a matter of what you 've got now . The question is what will you have for patches a year hence ? And as for the grass  --  I do n't see how I 'm going to handle it , with this blunt old hand mower , nor how you 're going to find time to go on weeding flowers . We 're only at it now because we cut church to tidy the place a little . We ca n't decently do that every Sunday morning , and I 'm sure you do n't want to . " " Of course Mrs. Phillips does n't want to cut church , " said a pleasant voice around the nearby corner of the house . " Nor you , Tom . For one thing , if you had been at the service this morning , I would n't have had to walk around here now . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees with mingled embarrassment and pleasure . " You do put us to shame . But now you 're here , you 'll stay for lunch , wo n't you ? I 've made the nicest stew . And I 've just prevailed on Tom not to put that horrid mole in it . " " Well , that 's good , in a negative way , " smiled the little priest . " I 'd like to accept  --  very much . But first I really should get some quantitative information about that stew . I do n't need to ask about the quality , understanding that the mole is out . " " I do n't quite follow , " said Tom . " You mean you 're especiallyhungry , after walking all the way over here ? I 'm sorry about that . We were using the time to try and get the outside fixed up a bit . It 's simply gone to pieces in the eight weeks since the explosion . And this afternoon I 've got to split woodp79for the hospital . Bill Jefferson is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cart , at five o'clock . " " Bill Jefferson is here now , " replied the priest . " He 's round at the back looking at your tobacco patch with Dr. Adler . They 're the two reasons , aside from my own quite adequate appetite , why I ventured to ask about the size of the stew . " Phillips fondled his chin with a grimy hand . " You mean , " he said sharply , " that you want Liss and me to ask Bill Jeffersonto lunch ? " " Not merely Bill , " replied Father Brown , " but Dr. Adler and myself as well . A Negro , a Jew , and a Catholic . Can you face it ? " " Why Tom and I will be delighted to have you all . " Alicia Phillips brushed her knees and tucked the loose flap of her blouse inside the trousers . " I 'm sure the stew will stand it , if you can , Father Brown . All we ask in return is absolution for missing church . That was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson , we wo n't regard him as a penance . Now excuse me , please , and I 'll go get things ready . " " Your wife is a fine woman , Tom , " said the priest , breakinga momentary silence . " She 's a southerner , too , is n't she ? " " A native Washingtonian , " Tom qualified . " So were her parents and two of her grandparents even . I think you 've shocked her a bit though . She 's certainly never had a colored person as a guest in the house before . " " Alle Anfang ist schwer . You 'll agree , I feel sure , that here on the island we have to break that ice some tune . There 's a lot of discontent among the colored people and it would be very bad , even dangerous , to let it fester . They think they 're being exploited to do all the hard physical labor while they do n't have any say in the decisions . " " The second criticism may be justified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a colored man on the island who works as hard as Walter Travis , or Tony Caselli , or Dr. Lawson , or you or I for that matter . "   " True enough , Tom , but we 're working more or less cooperativelyand they 're all working under orders . It makes a big difference . The old employer-employe relationship is broken for the colored folk and has to be replaced somehow . You know that Robert and Sarah have left the Brysons ? They moved their things over to Abe Lincoln 's cottage yes-terday . " " That 'll sure be tough on Elise and Ken . " " Very likely , but that 's their problem . Racial bitterness in this little community is a problem for all of us . That 's why I wanted to talk it over with you as an old-time islander . And since Bill Jefferson told me he wanted to see your tobacco , it seemed reasonable to bring him along . Bill 's a natural leader and scarcely anybody was critical when he began to turn up in church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first step . It 's another big step to have him to a meal in your house . " " And what do you think the last step will be ? " Phillips inquireddubiously . Alicia 's voice interrupted . " Dr. Adler and Bill are waiting in the kitchen , " she called . " Arc you coming , or do we have to eat this famous stew without benefit of clergy ? " Bill Jefferson wiped greasy hands on his even more greasy dungarees . " That sho ' was a fine stew , Miz Phillips , " he said . " Ah suttinly appreciate yo ' courtesy in asking me to par-take . " " I 'm glad you enjoyed it , Bill , " replied Alicia . " Now if you men will continue your talk in the study , I 'll clean up here . " " Ah hope you 'll lemme wash the dishes , ma'am . Ah always does that fo ' mall Annabelle . She says Ah 'm a good kitchen worker . " " There 's one heavy job you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You might take those two pails in the garage and fill our laundry tub with water from the pond . It 's myp81chore to get the washing water , so you 'll be doing me a favor . " " Do n't you use the pond water for drinking purposes ? " inquiredDr . Adler . " We do , down at the other end . " " I 'm sure it 's all right . Lawson says there 'll be no contaminationif everybody observes the rule about privies . But we happen to have a good spring , so we get drinking water there . We have a separate pail for that which , for some occult reason , Liss keeps in the deep freeze . Maybe you 'll fill that up too , Bill ? " " Ah 'll be rhos ' happy , " said the big Negro , rising from the kitchen table . " Where is yo ' pond-water buckets ? " " In the garage , right through that door , Bill , " directed Mrs. Phillips . " To get to the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path to the left . You 'll find a milk bottle besidethe big sour gum where the water bubbles out . Funny thing is , it runs faster and colder than it did before the ex-plosion . " Father Brown folded his paper napkin carefully . " It might be colder because the basalt subbase at this location is thicker than it used to be , " he said . " On the other hand , close to where the bomb hit we 've got boiling water laid on now . There must be a volcanic vent there , right down to the subcrustalmagma . " " Phil Baker thinks we ought to make use of that hot spring off-island , " observed Tom . " He says if we dig up some of our useless pipes we could re-lay them along the causeway with enough declivity to bring boiling water right to the hospital . Phil says they actually use hot springs for central heating in Iceland . He was stationed there during the war  --  World War II , I mean . " " It would be a terrific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , it 's just an idea , " said Phillips . " But I think it 's very encouraging that people are talking about these possibilities . Take Buchanan  --  he was a mining engineer , you know . He says this igneous rock that 's been thrown up is rich inp82iron ore and also contains bauxite . He wants to start smelting operations and he 's already got Polly at work making charcoal , with that in mind . " " He sent in a report on that iron ore for the meeting of the Emergency Committee yesterday , " said Father Brown . " And that brings up the point I want to make . Essentially , GumptionIsland is still being run as it always was . Instead of golf , tennis , and beach committees we 've got Lawson 's Committee on Health and Sanitation , mine on Morale and Education , and so on . But there are plenty of indications that this setup is n't good enough . It has n't got flexibility . " " How do you mean , flexibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll give you an example . When John Stokes came back to the island he naturally talked about that hot spring he found . Phil Baker heard of it , saw possibilities , and rowed right over to take a look . As a result , he got bawled out twice  --  by Admiral Evans , for taking the rowboat without permission ; by Reggie Showalter , for being A.W.O.L. from dinosaurpatrol . Phil was quite upset , for naturally he thought he was doing something in the public interest . Of course , both he and Martha are still terribly nervous because of what happened to Budge . " " It 's made us all nervous , " said Alicia Phillips . " But I know you 've helped the Bakers a great deal , Father Brown . Martha was telling me how much your visits mean to them . " " I do what I can . But there again you touch the problem . Do I visit the Bakers as a parish duty , or because I 'm Directorof Morale and Education ? It makes a difference ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather a quibble , " suggested Phillips , " so long as you do visit them ? " " No , it 's not a quibble , " said Dr. Adler . " I see what 's disturbingDavid . Essentially , it 's the problem of Church and State . Is he acting as priest or politician ? To what authority is he responsible ? " " That 's what I mean , Albert . You must admit that my position here is not easy . Technically , most of you people , P83excepting the Bradys , the Casellis , and the few other Catholics , are heretics . But you 've put me , a comparative stranger , in charge of the religious life of the community , with an ardent young Presbyterian as my assistant . On top of that , I 'm a member of the Directorate . On the one hand , I have perhaps too much political power ; on the other , I 'm certainly compromisingmy clerical obligations . I could be excommunicated for that form of service we had this morning . You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a regulation Mass . " " It did n't have much in common with a Jewish service , either . So I should n't have attended , if what you 're saying is that the outward formalities are of first importance . " " The external formalities are of the first importance , " said Father Brown , " in so far as their symbolic value helps to developinward grace . But by the same token , there is always a risk of obscuring the inner meaning by treating the formalityas an end in itself . I suppose I could be severely criticizedfor saying that . But I believe it , nonetheless . As I see my function here , I must neglect some forms of Catholicism in order to serve the spirit of the ecumenical Church . " " When Bill Jefferson wipes his hands on his pants instead of his napkin , " inquired Alicia , " does it mean he 's lacking in inward grace ? " " You pose the issue neatly , " Father Brown replied . " I would say that , when Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grace . And I am even more certain that you reveal it when you ask a Negro to break bread with you . " " And when you simultaneously invite a wandering Jew , " commented I ) r . Adler . " Well , to be honest , you were n't any of you actually invited , " laughed Tom . " You presented us with a fait accompli , Father Brown . And Liss played up to it adequately , as she always does . " " We 're all presented with a terrifying fait accompli , " said Father Brown . " And the general question is whether we canP84all play up to it adequately . The particular question now is how to organize ourselves , politically , to give the best chance of successful response from everyone . That 's what I came here to discuss . " At a tap on the door , Alicia Phillips rose to admit Bill Jefferson , with two brimming pails of water . " This yere 's from the pond , " he said . " Ah rested the bucket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thank you , Bill , " said Alicia . " Will you just empty those pails into the laundry tub , beside that useless automatic washer ? And now I really wish you men would carry your discussion into Tom 's study . I 'd like to clean my kitchen . " Father Brown and Dr. Adler seated themselves on the big couch at one side of the fireplace . Tom Phillips sank into an easy chair facing them . Bill Jefferson , shyly declining its mate , selected a straight-back placed cater-cornered to the others . His eyes wandered over the library shelves , filled from floor to ceiling on three sides of the room . " It ai n't possible for no man to have read all them books , " he thought . " Do you mind if I indulge my curiosity as to your current studies ? " asked Dr. Adler , lifting the thick red volume beside a candlestick on the fireside table . " Plato , eh , in the Jowett translation . Well , do you find anything in the Republic to throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there might be , " replied Phillips , with some diffidence . " Until last night , I had n't looked at the Republicsince college . And I have n't yet improved my acquaintancevery thoroughly . Went sound asleep over it , as a matter of fact . But I had the thought that , since we have to build from the ground up , we might at least consider the Greek city-state . Seems to me we have something like the makings , here on Gumption Island . " " Is that the third volume of the Oxford edition , " inquired Father Brown , " the one including the Timaeus and Critias as well as the Republic ? "  | " That 's right , " said Dr. Adler , leafing through the back of the volume . " You know , I 've always been curious about what happened to prevent completion of the Critias . A great loss , I think , because , plausible or not , the Atlantis myth is certainly fascinating . " " I 'm afraid I never read Timaeus or Critias , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mused Bill , " is honest anyhow . Those are right pretty names : Timmyus and Crityus . Ah wonder if Annabelle is going to have twins . She sure is big enough . " " I was thinking , " observed Father Brown , " that what Plato says about Atlantis may have more significance for us than the Republic . I do n't suppose there 'll be much sentiment here for holding wives and children in common ; perhaps a little more for the system of slavery . But , if I recall correctly , Plato does give us a salutary warning in the Critias . " " We 've had our catastrophe , " said Dr. Adler . " So it 's a little late for warnings . " He put on his spectacles and turned to the end of the book . " It certainly does have punch though . Listen to this ! " " Such was the vast power which the god settled in the lost island of Atlantis . . . . For many generations , as long as the divine nature lasted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards the god , whose seed they were ; for they possessed true and in every way great spirits , unitinggentleness with wisdom in the various chances of life , and in their intercourse with one another . They despised everythingbut virtue , caring little for their present state of life , and thinking lightly of the possession of gold and other property , which seemed only a burden to them . . . . But when ... the human nature got the upper hand , they then , being unable to bear their fortune , behaved unseemly , and to him who had an eye to see grew visibly debased , for they were losing the fairest of their precious gifts . Yet to those who had no eye to see the true happiness , they appeared gloriousp86and blessed at the very time when they were full of avarice and unrighteous power . ' " With bushy eyebrows raised , Dr. Adler looked quizzically at Phillips . " I suppose , " replied the latter slowly , " your point is that we Americans were becoming as visibly debased as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are suggestingthat the same punishment has been applied to us for the same offense ? " " Oh , I 'm not ready to draw that conclusion . The moral law is Father Brown 's field , not mine . I 'm merely reading a passage that impressed me greatly when I first studied it in the original Greek . I will say that the ending supports your hypothesis . Zeus calls the lesser gods into consultation to determinewhat should be done about the corrupted people of Atlantis . Here we are : It was deemed necessary to inflict punishment on them , that they might be chastened and improve . ' So Zeus collected all the gods into their most holy habitation . . . . And when he had called them together , he spake as follows : . . . ' Unfortunately , that 's where the fragmentbreaks off . " " It has been asserted , " said Father Brown , " that Plato stopped at that point because he did n't have any definite idea of what the punishment should be . He had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , and decided a note of suspense would make the best ending . Of course , Zeus only controlled thunderbolts  --  no thermonuclear bombs . " " It could be merely that Xanthippe came in and interrupted , " suggested Phillips . " These yere white folks , " reflected Bill Jefferson , " can suttinly talk fluid once they gets going . " From the hip pocket of his dungarees he extracted a stub of pencil and a battered notebook . On a clear page , with his lips forming the words , he slowly printed : " Zantippy  --  Tirnmyus  --  Crityus . " " Nevertheless , " said Dr. Adler , " an impressive theory of what happened to Atlantis has been developed by joining Plato 's account to other evidence , geological , archaeological ,  |p87and  literary , including Genesis and Revelation , as I do n't need to tell you , David . " " You mean the ideas of Ignatius Donnelly and Lewis Spence ? " inquired the priest . " I read Donnelly when I was a seminarian . But I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a forgotten people with high cultural development , very seriously . Of course , we do have a generalracial recollection of an era of devastating floods . It must trace to the experience of the human survivors . Is n't the theme of a universal deluge equally pronounced in Eastern mythology , Albert ? " " It is . But the Atlantis legend has special features and they come to mind when you realize that we have n't seen the moon since our own local catastrophe . Are you familiar with that Viennese astronomer , Hans Hoerbiger ? He argues that the moon was for a long time a solar planet ; that it was , he says , eventually captured ' by the earth to become our satellite ; that this took place only about 10,000 B.C. , which is the approximate date accepted by all the Atlantis enthusiasts . Anyway , if the moon hitched onto us then , the resulting tidal and volcanic convulsions would have wiped out the civilization previously attained by Cro-Magnon man who was , perhaps , as intellectually competent as we are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that Ah jes ' ai n't intellectuallycompetent . With all this yak-yak , they 's clean forgot Ah 's supposed to pick up a load o ' wood fo ' the hospital . Maybe I 'd better say something to git us down to earth again . " As though reading his mind , Tom Phillips interrupted . " This is all very fascinating , gentlemen , " he said . " But I 'm afraid I 've got to split some logs . I promised a load of firewoodto Dr. Lawson , for this afternoon . And I have n't got it all ready yet , not by any means . " " We must all get back to our chores , " assented Father Brown , taking the volume from the table . " But first let me find the warning in the Critias which I mentioned . It 's not the part you quoted , Albert . That says the gods destroyedp88Atlantis because of the moral degeneracy of its people . My passage describes the problem of the survivors , after the catastrophe . Ah , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , " said Dr. Adler . " All right , Critias is speaking about what happened after Atlantis was destroyed . He says : When there were any survivors , they were men who dwelt in the mountains . . . the virtues and the laws of their predecessors , they knew only by obscure traditions ; and as they themselves and their children lacked for many generations the necessaries of life , they directed their attention to the supply of their wants , and of them they conversed , to the neglect of events that had happened in times long past . ' " " You mean , " inquired Phillips , " that we 'd better talk about how we 're going to govern ourselves , as well as how we 're going to feed ourselves ? " " He means , " assented Dr. Adler , " that it was a sound instinctfor you to look up Plato . Perhaps now you 'd better examine The Federalist papers . I 'll wager not half a dozen people on this island have ever read them . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of governmentany consideration . " " Excuse me , " interrupted Alicia Phillips , appearing in the doorway with a berry box in her hand . " Do any of you men know mushrooms when you see them ? I picked these in the woods and they look good , but I do n't know whether they 're edible . There 're lots more of them . " " Ah kin tell you , ma'am , " said Bill Jefferson , rising and taking the basket . He lifted the specimens one by one , looked at the undersides , smelled each carefully , and then smiled broadly . " Yes , ma'am , " he said . " They 's all good mushrooms . Growingthings is somethin ' Ah do know about . And Ah also knows it 's time fo ' me to git the cart and tote that load o ' wood that Mr. Phillips sez is half-ready . " " In other words , " said Father Brown , " what goes onto a plate counts as much as what went into Plato ! Tom , withp89your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes more . We 've got to utilize some of this stored-up wisdom , if we want to save something more than our mere physicalexistence . " Closing the door behind the Phillipses and the big Negro , Father Brown turned back to Dr. Adler , who was examining the crowded bookshelves . " Well , Albert , what do you think Bill made of that conversation ? " he asked . " If your object was to confuse him , I think you succeeded admirably . " Pulling out a leather-bound volume , the Jewish scholar scrutinized its title page . " Our host , " he continued , " is something of a collector . This is the Allston Mygatt editionof Madison 's Reports ; three volumes , published at Mobile in 1842 , and almost unobtainable now . My Philadelphiabookseller told me he once combed the South for that particular edition . He found a number of copies , but no owner would sell . Southerners are really interested in Americanpolitical theory , David . Of course they have to be , in order to justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing at a time , please , Albert , " said the priest . " About Bill Jefferson ; I was n't trying to confuse him any more than you were . But I 'll confess I was willing to have him feel a little out of his depth . He 's had a real succes d'estime , being invited to eat with white people , and that 's part of what I wanted . Now he 'll tell the other darkies that racial prejudice is diminishing here on the island . But he 'll also tell them that the whites  --  or some of them  --  have all the book learning . Then they 'll tend to go along happily with whatever plan of political organization is presented , provided it does n't offend their sense of justice . " " You 're quite a politician , David . " " A priest has to be . The Church was n't built by men indifferent to politics . As far as the Negroes go , I 'll warrant they 'll now follow any lead we give , and that will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turner , and the maintenancemen , led by Bill Jefferson . So right now is the psy/chological moment to decide how this island should be governed . And that 's where you and I come in . We understand this bourgeois community the better because we . do n't either of us really belong to it . " " In other words , you want my advice as an acceptable Jew . I 'm to be Barney Baruch to your Jim Farley ? " " Okeh , elder statesman , let 's summarize the situation . What we have now is actually a clumsy directorate . It must be replaced for two reasons . First , because a dictatorship eventually demands a single , recognized dictator . Second , because conditions here are wholly unsuitable for a dictatorship , even if efficient and humane . " " I 'm not sure of your second point . Emergencies produce dictators , and Gumption Island is certainly in an emer-gency . " " Emergencies produce dictatorships in communities that are either very simple or very complex . This is neither one nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as cultural background goes , and it 's unusually homogeneousexcept for the 15 per cent of colored people . There 's more professional skill in this group than you would find in most communities of the same size . But those unusual abilities will soon fade out , as the Critias warns us , unless we organize in a manner calculated to preserve them . " " The only parallel I think of is Pitcairn Island . I recall that Fletcher Christian tried to run it on a democratic basis and it soon went to pieces . " " I 'm not so sure . There 's a copy of the Nordhoff-Hall book at the Edminsters and I 've been refreshing my memory of it . Liquor , weak leadership , and racial antagonism almost ruined the Pitcairn Islanders . But eventually , you remember , they rallied round the Bible and came through . It was the women on Pitcairn  --  native women too  --  who really saved the day . " " Are you suggesting a theocracy ? I might help you there . It 's decidedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Albert , that you and I and Walter Travisp91could run this island quite effectively as a triumvirate , with Walter as First Consul . Everybody on the island likes him . He 's deeply religious , in an unostentatious way . And he has unusual business ability . So do you  --  as a racial trait , I suppose . Economics and finance confuse me  --  always have . " " But politics does n't ? Well , you 'd better realize that it 's impossible to divorce politics and economics . For instance , if you 're a Socialist , you believe in centralized planning and official directives . That means free enterprise is counter to your belief and what counters belief soon comes to be regarded as inherently evil . I do n't think you can apply socialismto this particular group of Americans ; certainly not if you have faith in them as individuals . " " The essence of socialism seems to me to be lack of faith in individual decency , " said Father Brown . " It is . Karl Marx was a thorough cynic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So he reasoned , with very good logic if you grant his premise , that they must be governed in every detail for their own good . That was his real thought . Engel 's incidental suggestion that the allpowerfulstate would eventually wither away ' was eyewash . No real Communist believes that . " " What I do n't like , " reflected Father Brown , " is that we 're already drifting into a sort of primitive socialism here . Everything is regimented by the Emergency Committee , and often in a contradictory way . " " Well , that 's quite in keeping . It 's a microcosm of the stage the country as a whole had reached . Remember when Eisenhower said that government ought to be a Big Brother ' to everybody  --  just like Orwell 's 198 ! No , if you want to prevent socialism , which is the logical outcome of political democracy , there 's only one certain safeguard . " " And that is ? " " To keep the control of money out of the hands of the government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " No , that does n't matter so much . Taxation as such is justp92a device for redistributing wealth and the power it gives . I think that can be called a proper governmental function . Free enterprise can survive high taxation , but not financial manipulation by the government . It was the gold standard that kept us a free country . And , for good historical reasons , every intelligent Jew understands the significance of gold . As a matter of fact , between ourselves , I 'm wearing a beltful of double eagles at this minute . I 've never travelled anywhere without them , since 1932 . It 's funny to think that now I 've carried these five hundred gold dollars back fifty million years . " Unhooking his belt , Dr. Adler opened an inner flap , extracteda yellow coin , and flipped it in the air . " Heads or tails ? " he inquired enigmatically , extending his closed hand towards Father Brown . " Oh , heads every time , Albert , " laughed the priest , his blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts . " " Suggesting that you put sentiment above intelligence ? I very much doubt it . But I wo n't give you away . You really see what I have in mind ? " " I see that you 've put us in a position to cut the Gordian knot . The Emergency Committee has turned down Bryson 's scheme for a private bank of issue designed primarily to benefit himself . We 're still boggling over the alternative of labor certificates , which would put a high premium on mere physical strength and endurance . For various reasons , nobodyliked the idea of assignats . Now I gather that you 're proposing a governmental gold reserve which you will personallycontribute to the community , on the understanding that paper currency will be issued against it at a fixed ratio ? " " That 's it , essentially . Of course , the ratio does n't matter , so long as it 's immutable . We could issue one hundred or one thousand gumptions , or whatever you want to call them , against each gold dollar of reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the currency inconvertible , until we get a free market established . "  | " We 'll call your gold eagles Adlers , of course ! " " Thanks for the compliment . But , David , I 've got two specific conditions . " " As many as you want , so far as I can honorably help fulfillthem . " " I must insist , first , that we adopt a written constitution making it clear that this gold reserve will always be independentof political manipulation of any kind . And I further suggest that Bryson and myself be made permanent governorsof this reserve , with power to name our own successors . Bryson , let me tell you , is a most able man . " " But he seems to me very unscrupulous , " protested Father Brown . " It 's my feeling that he tried to pull a fast one , solely for selfish reasons . " " In a free society , David , you ca n't penalize that selfish instinct , without also paralyzing the God-given ability that so often goes with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acquisitive instinct serve the general welfare . Remember , I 'm not demanding that Bryson and I be appointed financial managers . I 'm only asking that , in due course , you exert your influence in behalf of that selection . Meantime , I 'll talk to Bryson , who feels a bit of a pariah right now . " " I 'll do what I can , " the priest promised . " But the first step , clearly , is to call a convention , its members to be elected by full adult suffrage , and then have that convention draft a constitution . " " You 've got good precedent for that , " said Dr. Adler , tapping the volume of Madison 's Reports . " We 've also got good precedent for helping our host with his woodpile , " said Father Brown . " Good heavens , it 's almostfour o'clock ! " " The time has n't been wasted , " said Dr. Adler . " Whoa there , Kelly , " cried Bill Jefferson , pulling the big white horse to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turnaround between the clubhouse and club cottage . He looked across the battered seaside lawn , where half a dozen colored men with shovels labored to improve the sixfootdyke of sand and stones and lumber that now protected the club verandah . A heavy surf was swirling long fingers of foam to within a few yards of this barrier and the strong east wind drove stinging particles of spray through the tatteredscreening of the once immaculate promenade . Tony Caselli , watching the workmen from this partial shelter , walked over as Bill jumped lightly from the wagon . " Are you taking Kelly back to the stable after you unload that wood ? " he asked curtly . " Yas , suh . " " Then take the boys with you . They 've put in a hard afternoon , for Sunday . They 've earned a ride home , if it 's not too much for the horse . " " Kelly 's all right , suh . He was restin ' all mawnin ' . But we has n't got hardly any mo ' oats for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter Travis about that . He feeds the horse ; I work him . That 's the division of responsibility . " " Yas , suh , " said Bill dubiously . " Does yo ' tell me whah Ah unloads dis yore wood ? Or is Dr. Lawson responsible fo ' that ? " " He 's home resting , " interposed young Dr. Griffin , from the doorway of the improvised hospital . " You can stack as much in this vestibule as wo n't block passage , Bill , and the rest of it should go in the garage at the back . There 's plenty of room there . " " Those logs would make a nice bracing for the dyke , " said Caselli . " It 's got a lot of weak spots . You 'll be in trouble here , Doctor , if we ever get a bad nor'easter . " " In that case , I do n't think the logs would help much . And we need them badly inside ; both for the stove Mrs. Hoffmann gave us for the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's never really cold here , thank heaven.  |p95But  after any rain , the place is always damp . Is that wood seasoned , Bill ? " " Yas , suh . Mr. Phillips had it all cut by the corporation befo ' he built his new house , and Ah remember slicin ' those trees up wid the power saw . He was splittin ' them smaller , like Dr. Lawson ordered , when Ah went fo ' to load up a while back . But Mr. Phillips ai n't so good wid wedges and maul . I ' spec he 's better handlin ' books . So I took a hand and that 's why Ah 'm late . " " Well you wo n't be any earlier for gabbling now , " said Tony . " Hurry up and stack it where the doctor says . Those boys are tired and I want you to get them home . It 's too dark to work any more anyway . " Night was closing in as Bill Jefferson started to drive his human load to the stable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weary workmen sprawled or sat heavily in the back of the wagon . George Garvey , one-time chef at the club , perched on the front seat with Bill , broke silence . " I jes ' kaint take this hard work like you outdoor men , " he complained , as Kelly meandered slowly down Bayswater Drive , parallel to what had been the first fairway . " I 'd a bin mos ' too joed to git home , if DIr . Caselli had n't fixed up this ride . He 's always fair , but he sho ' do push hard . A shovel 's mighty heavy , when you ai n't used to anything bigger than a fry pan . " " Tony Caselli is Dago trash , " said the bitter voice of Abe Lincoln . " ' That 's why Mr. Bryson keep him outa the club , " explainedSam Turner , the former headwaiter . " There 's a real gentleman . If you maintenance men had n't hel Eyed to bust up his plan , I 'd be working for that bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It wo n't do you no harm to sweat for wunst in yo ' life , Sam , " retorted Joel Harris , the corporation 's handy man . " As fo ' Mr. Caselli , he ai n't got perfec ' manners , but Ah feel like George Garvey . Tony ai n't no jip . He 's straight . " Steve Douglas , also an ex-waiter , pulled himself to a sit/ting position as the cart creaked round the curve by the monument to Dr. Gumption . " White folks is very different , " he said philosophically . " Some seems generous and is really mean . Some seems stingy , but you knows they wo n't let you down . Take Mr. Travis . He neber tip heavy . But if yo ' got any trouble , he or Mrs. Travis 'll hep yo ' out  --  ebery time . " Paul Stoner , released as butler-chauffeur by once wealthy Mrs. Hoffmann , laughed ironically . " Steve do n't say all his trouble comes out the bottle , " he observed . " Quit scrappin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " interposed Bill Jefferson . " Ah went to church this mawnin ' . And afterwards I'se talkin ' with Mr. Travis about these yere fruit trees  --  they needs mo ' water  --  and Father Brown comes up with that Jew perfesser , Dr. Adler . And they says : Bill , come over to Mr. Phillips wid us and take a squint at his terbaccer . ' And I says : Father , Ah 'd like to but Ah ought to get home an ' see mah Annabelle '  --  she 's right sorrowful now . An ' he says , That 's okeh , Bill , yo ' tell Perry Warren to tell her I took you off for lunch . ' So we goes over to the Phillipses . They was n't to church . And they ast me to stay for lunch and Ah sits down at the table beside Miz Phillips and eats there . " " I'se sure glad to hear that , " said George Garvey . " I never could see why if I'se good enough to cook fo ' white folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em . I guess they 's gettin ' some sense beat in ' em now . When I was in the infirmity , with a bad foot , they had me in a bed between Perfesser Stevens and Mistah Randolph . And Dr. Lawson took jes ' as much time fo ' me as fo ' them . " " They 's one thing yo ' got to hand white folks , or some of ' em anyhow , " affirmed Bill . ' ' They does have the hell of a lot mo ' book learnin ' than we does . I wuz in Mr. Phillips ' liberry  --  he 's got nigh on a million books  --  and Father Brown and Dr. Adler and him got talkin ' about the damndest things . It seems what 's happened here ai n't j es ' no bomb . It 's mo ' like the flood that of Noah rode out in the Ark . They reads out of a big red book about it  --  not the Bible neither . It had somep97good-soundin ' names of people  --  like Timmyus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as I recollec ' . " " So yo ' sits round idle on yo ' big ass and then is late deliveringthat wood , " remarked Paul Stoner . " Then you tells Mr. Caselli it 's becuz yo ' had to help Mr. Phillips split it . " " Ah did hep him split it , Paul . And that 's part of what Ah 'm tryin ' to say . Mr. Phillips has books about mos ' everything , but he kaint split wood proper . Miz Phillips has the nices ' house you ever see , but she doan know a mushroom from a toadstool . Ah had to tell her . " " Oh , that ai n't unnatural , " explained Sam Turner . " It 's part of what Mr. Bryson calls division of labor . Trouble now is we 're all scrambled up . Take me  --  the best headwaiter you 'll ever see  --  reduced to working in a gang . And all I get for it is an order on Mr. Waynfleet letting me draw some grub . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said the ex-chef gloomily . " I know as well as Greg Waynfleet what 's in the storeroom . It 's j es ' about cleaned out . " Bill Jefferson turned the wagon into the dirt road running back from the boatyard to the idle power plant . Two or three lights burned dimly in the row of cabins on the west side . To the east , with neat rows of vegetables still visible in the gathering dusk , was a big , well-tended field . " That stuff there , " said Bill Jefferson pointing , " is ready to harvest now . They 's enough beans and carrots and beets and tomatoes in that field fo ' everbody on the island . Mr. Travis says to start pickin ' tomorrow , and you'se goin ' to head-wait out there in the sun wid rne , Sam . Ah guess we ai n't goin ' to starve , anyhow . Not with me and Mr. Travis as good at gardening as we is . " " I guess we got to leave it to the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " so long as they treat us decent . " " Time is goin ' to tell ' bout dat , " concluded Bill . " Right now , they gets the benefit ob any doubt . Whoa da , Kelly ! Jump out , boys , dis yere boss wants his supper , and so does  | " Yo ' don ' git no supper , Bill , unless you'se mighty brisk , " called a woman 's voice from the door of the nearest cabin . " I'se readyin ' fo ' bed . " " Ah 'll be right wid yo ' , Annabelle , " replied Bill cheerfully . Deftly he unharnessed the horse , led him to the stall in the stable across the road , and felt to make sure that water and forage were in place . He hung the harness in the tack room and crossed over to where his wife was waiting . Down the little hallway a kerosene lamp burned dimly in the kitchen . " I know you'se had a hard day , Bill , " said his wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stew , all warmed up . " " Hell 's bells , " Bill grumbled , " Ah figured on a change from stew . That 's what I had fo ' my Sunday dinner , over at Phillipses . " " I bet it war n't as good as mine , Bill , " said Annabelle , embracing him . " Ah put mushrooms in this one . " " You 's right , honey . Cookin ' ai n't white folks ' strong point . Mah Gawd , Annabelle , yo ' belly sure am big . Don ' I feel some bumpin ' there ? " " Ah guess yo ' does , if yo ' has any feelings . Bill , Dr. Lawson come by this afternoon , and he says I really is going to have twins . " " Sho'nuf ? Well , I'se got two good names all set  --  Timmyus and Crityus . " " Oh , go on , Bill . Eat yo ' stew . They 's right pretty names though . Is they both boys ? " " They 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Golden Age , befo ' sex come in . So they 'll fit whatever way you fixes it . "  | " WE NEED MORE charcoal , Stan , " said Dr. Lawson , taking some chunks from the nearly empty scuttle and feeding them into the old-fashioned kitchen stove . " Will you fill out the form ? " Dr. Griffin grunted , took a final squint through his microscope , extracted the glass slide , and slipped it into an envelope . " It would be scarcely more trouble to make it ourselves , " he complained . " There must be some better way of getting essentials than this red-tape system you fellows have devised . " " Trouble lies in the allocation of labor . I never realized myself how automatically these things used to work out . " The junior physician jotted a note on the envelope , put it in a drawer of the table , and got up from his stool . " I still do n't see why these requisitions , " he grumbled . " You 're Director of Health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Director of Public Works , that our laboratory has to have so much charcoal ? Then it 's up to him to provide it , as best he can . " " That 's precisely what I did and while I wash I 'll tell you what happened . Caselli sent Bill Jefferson over to help Polly , who 's making charcoal for Buchanan 's forge . But except for John Stokes , Bill 's the only one of us who can milk a cow . Then John breaks his leg and , come milking time , nobody but Caselli knows where Bill is working and nobody can locate Caselli , who 's assigned himself to help with the barge they 're building at Houseboat Cove . Result is , Walter Travis says he reckons he can still milk , and cuts a meeting of the Direc/torate to do it . And that meant we could n't settle anything definitely because nobody knew Walt 's requirements . " " Sounds like the house that Jack built . But was n't that all due to an accident ? People do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The real difficulty was n't the accident . It was the lack of that complete centralization you must have in a planned economy , no matter how primitive . That 's why Doggy introducedthe requisitions . They all have to be cleared . You take that slip of paper , saying we need two bags of charcoal , over to the corporation office . Waynfleet lists it along with all the others . They 're brought up to the Directorate  --  we 're meetingevery morning now  --  and , as far as the available supplies and labor permit , the requests are granted , in order of importance . Waynfleet acts as secretary and keeps a record of who is assigned to what job every day . " " It sounds dreadfully bureaucratic , Harry . I wonder how many man-hours are withdrawn from productive labor by your scarcity system ? I 'll bet we 're wasting a quarter of our total working time . " " Oh , at least ; but it 's not my system . We all know we 've got to get something better and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates chosen will draft a constitutionwhich we hope will give us all more freedom to produce whatever we can . Now , Stan , excuse me if I get on with this solution . The fire 's hot at last . " Dr. Griffin watched reflectively as his companion measured water into a saucepan from a pail standing in the sink , took a small red box from his pocket , extracted a cellophane capsule , and carefully shook a few greenish pellets into the saucepan . " But why do n't you fellows on the Directorate draft this constitution yourselves ? " he resumed . " What makes you think all the people on the island , black and white , will choose a group that 's better qualified ? Personally , I anticipatethat those elected will be less competent . " " They may prove less well qualified , " assented Lawson , stirring his compound delicately . " On the other hand , they'llp101probably be more representative . If there 's any serious kick about the form of government proposed , at least nobody will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its development . Moreover , after the five delegates have drafted the organic law , there 'll be a plebiscite as to whether or not we adopt it . I do n't suppose there 'll be any question about that . The only alternative would be to muddle along as we are , which nobody wants . " " I think you 've voiced the only real argument there is for democracy : its representative feature , I mean . But politics really does n't interest me . I am wondering , Harry , what 's that concoction you 're brewing ? " Dr. Lawson stopped stirring , moved the bubbling saucepanto the back of the stove , and placed a lid over it . " I 'm making a strychnine solution , " he said slowly . " Probably a little weaker than it ought to be . This mole poison from my garden shed is one-half of one per cent strychnine sulphate . I 'm using six of the pellets to a pint of water . And I propose to dose myself a tablespoonful every morning . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Has the heart been misbehaving lately , Harry ? " " To tell you the truth , Stan , yes . Please do n't mention it , but I 'm afraid the old pump 's giving out . And that leads to something I wanted to take up with you . We ought to be training one of those girls who are working under Lu . When I go , you 'll need all the help you can get ; and Pres Washburn , while a first-class dentist , does n't pretend to know physiology . " " I certainly hope you 're wrong in your personal diagnosis , Harry . But in any case , you 're right about teaching one of our amateur nurses what we can , while we can . The Hippocraticoath and all that ! " " Which of the girls would you choose ? " " Jill Clendenning , unquestionably . She 's much more interested in medicine than is Mary Anderson . Her nerves are good . She was very helpful setting John Stokes ' leg . Also , though it sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since young Showalter went . I gather that Mary is giving more thought to Peter Clarke than anything else . " " You confirm my opinion . Jill 's only defect is this dreaminessto which she 's subject . But , with more responsibility , she may brood less . You sound her out then . Why not do it right now , Stan , while I 'm away ? " " Where are you going ? Home to rest , I hope . " " Do n't laugh , but I promised poor John , who 's pretty restless confined to bed here , that I 'd look at Buster for him . Apparently Buster is off his feed . " " Buster ? Is he one of the colored boys ? " " No ; Buster 's the bull . Our one and only bull and thereforepotentially more important than any other male on this island . Incidentally , he 's going to be a father soon and either you or I will have to be on call when Goldenrod has her accouchement . You 'd better warn Jill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here from now on . The trend towards specialization has certainly been re-versed . " " A good thing , too . You know , I like this G.P. work . But with reference to that pregnant cow . Would n't it be well to make a check for possible mutations , when the calf comes ? " " If you want , Stan . But I 'm not worried about radioactive fall-out . I talked with Polly . He says there ca n't be any becausedisruption of the time-space continuum was coincident with the blast . So , in our case , fall-out is deferred for fifty million years , more or less . " " Hm , sounds logical  --  and to some extent consoling . Well , any instructions , Harry , before you leave to take Buster 's pulse ? " " I think everything 's under control , Stan . You might tell me what your microscopic test revealed ? " " Oh , malignant , without a doubt . But I believe it 's localized . I think we can save her , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I was afraid of it . Well , we 'll have to do the best we can and I 'm sure she 'll play up . But before you tellp103her anything , let 's have a talk . There 's a possible alternative to an operation , in this particular case . " " Okeh . I 'll make the rounds while you 're away . And I 'll have a chat with Jill before she goes off duty . Mary Andersonis on night shift this week . " " A little wider , Sidney , if you do n't mind , " said Dr. Washburn , leaning over the low back of the armchair in which his patient sat . " That 's fine . I can see now . Yes , all the decay is out . I 'm sorry it 's been so tedious but this scraping by hand is hard on me too . Will you rinse once more , please . Swirl it into that hollow tooth as well as you can . " Judge Anderson complied , then spat the water out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . " I 'm glad that 's over , " he said . " Well , it 's not exactly over , Judge  --  not quite . We still have to fill the tooth . And there I 'm able to offer a choice . I have some temporary filling which will patch you up for a few weeks , but of course it 's only a makeshift . I also have a little kaolin which ought to prove very durable . Do you want to use that ? I warn you , it 's experimental . But it ca n't do worse than come out in pieces . " " Kaolin ? That 's china clay , is n't it ? Are you proposing to bake it in my mouth ? " " Oh , no ! Just let it harden slowly under the influence of your own saliva . Naturally , I 'll cement it in . This is a big cavity and I think a solid porcelain crown should prove quite satisfactory . Of course , it 's not like gold ; but Dr. Adler tells me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the arts . It 's all to be kept to insure a stable currency . I had to admit that a gold filling is n't readily convertible . " " Where did you get this kaolin ? It is n't standard dental equipment , is it ? " " Not that I ever heard . It comes from the old feldspar thrown up off-island by the explosion . Phil Baker brought some back . Then he and Buchanan put their heads togetherp104and found a way to hasten decomposition of the stuff . Phil thought I could use some here in my work , and I think so too . He says he 's planning to make a porcelain tea service , and I 'm sure he could , if he wanted . " " Well , go ahead , Pres , I 'll be the guinea pig . Is that your next patient ? " Responsive to the knock , Washburn opened the door of the converted bedroom . Cool and charming in her white dress , Jill Clendenning stood in the passage . " Excuse me , Dr. Washburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the children 's soup over to the school and I 'm also leaving a requisition at the office for Dr. Griffin . I wondered if I could do anything for you . " " Hello , Jill , " said the Judge , looking round the side of his chair . " Oh , how are you , Judge Anderson ? I did n't recognize the back of your head . " " No wonder , with this haircut Sam Turner gave me by candlelight . He says he 's better at shaving , but life nowadays is too exacting for that pastime . How do you like my beard ? " " It certainly should impress any wrongdoer brought before you , " said Jill . " It certainly has depressed his dentist , " interposed Washburn . " For some reason , the Judge 's beard reminds me that I 've got to pick raspberries this afternoon . This is the best second crop we 've ever had ; the berries , I mean . But the Committeeruling is I must turn in three quarts out of every four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know whether we have any soap ? My piece is down to a sliver , and I 've got to keep my hands clean for this job . " " I should hope so , " assented his patient warmly . " You remind me that Sally found a box of Ivory , searching through an old trunk yesterday . She 's keeping one bar and sending the rest up here by Mary this evening . " " That 's generous , " commented Jill . " If everybody were equally co-operative , we might not be so short on everything . As far as soap goes , Phil Baker says he 'll make some out ofp105mutton fat when John Stokes can get around to killing a sheep . " " I 'll settle right now for one cake from Mrs. Anderson , " said the dentist . " And if it were legal , Sidney , I 'd swap a box of black-market raspberries for it . " " I must n't stay to listen to such temptation , " laughed Jill . " But I 'll be back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of daytime sleep , Judge ? " " She seems to manage , " growled Judge Anderson , opening his mouth ferociously at Dr. Washburn 's signal . " I 'm sure the soup will be here soon , Toddy , " said Daisy Crashaw , looking a little anxiously at her tiny wrist watch . " You must be patient . They 're very busy at the hospital now . " " My father is n't very busy there , " contradicted Charley Washburn . " He says he wishes he had more professional work and fewer odd jobs , like picking raspberries and makingfishhooks . " " Is yo ' father really makin ' fishhooks ? " asked Fenny Jones incredulously . " How 's he do that ? " " He 's making big strong hooks , to catch those porpoises that play round off Indian Point now . He 's fixed up two already , out of telephone wire . Captain Howland and AdmiralEvans is goin ' fishin ' . . " Are going fishing , " corrected Daisy Crashaw . " Are going fishing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ porpoises is full of oil . . . " " Are full of oil . " " Are full of oil , an ' we can boil it out of the blubber and use it for oil lamps when the candles are all gone . " Peggy Wilson , sitting at her little desk in the front row , suddenly burst into tears . " Why , what 's the trouble , Peggy ? " Mrs. Crashaw patted the golden head , bent disconsolately over a tattered spellingbook.  | " Oh , she 's just mixed up , " said Lucia Caselli , with the casual superiority of fourteen to six . " She 's a crybaby anyhow , and her father tells her not to blubber . So when Charley says we 're going to boil blubber out of porpoises , she gets skeered for herself . " " Gets scared for herself , " repeated Mrs. Crashaw with a sigh of relief . " Nobody 's going to hurt you , Peggy . That 's a different sort of blubber that fish have . You must learn not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry about anything , " said Charley Washburn firmly . " Not to cry about nothing is a double negative . You contradict yourself . " " Well , not exactly , " protested Daisy . " It is n't the same thing to say not to cry about anything when you mean not to cry about nothing , which really means not to cry about everything , if you see what I mean . " " Here 's Miss Jill ! " shouted Billy Watson , jumping from his seat by the window and rushing to the open door . " Thank goodness , " said Daisy . " Get your cups , children , and line them up on the table . Clean spoons in the box on the shelf . Billy , please go to the clubhouse pump and get a pail of water for washing up . " " Hello , Daisy , " said Jill , heaving her steaming aluminum boiler onto the table . " If you did n't know it , I can tell you that soup for sixteen is a load . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh no , she 's fine . I 'm filling in because she 's drafted to make that paper money . The Directorate approved Polly 's design and they 're drawing the notes upstairs now . Madeleine does one side and Polly the other , with his wording in Russian letters . He says he 's sure nobody else on the island could forge that script . " " That 's nice for Madeleine , " said Jill a little bitterly . " Nobody 's asked me to work with an attractive young man . " " Now , Jill , you know perfectly well Bobby Macphersonwould work with you at anything , any time you 'll let him . Moreover , Madeleine only has this job today and tomorrow ,  |p107I  'm glad to say . They 're making fewer than seven hundred notes to start . There 'll be 500 of one gumption each ; 100 of five gumptions . Then  --  I ca n't recall how the others are divided . " Richard Norton , Jr. , listening with all the concentration of which twelve years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; twenty-five of twenty ; and ten of fifty , " he said . ' that makes 2500 gumptions all told . Five gumptions will be worth a gold dollar . My father and Mr. Bryson were talking about it last night . They said we 'll go on using what coins we have . A dime will be a half-gumption and nickels will be quarters , if you get the idea . " " I want my soup , " cried Estelle Jefferson resentfully . " Of course , dear , " said Jill . " Line up , children , youngest first , the way you do for Miss Buchanan . Do you have any crackers , Daisy ? " " Just one box , " said Mrs. Crashaw , getting it from her desk . " And Mr. Waynfleet says it will have to last us all week . He says there are sixty crackers in the box . How do I work that out ? " " That 's easy , " asserted Richard . " Sixty crackers for fifteen children is four crackers for one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only four-fifths of a cracker a day . " " Richard , " said Jill , " when we start a college we 'll certainlyput you in charge of mathematics . Let 's call it a cracker a day apiece and hope Mr. Waynfleet will approve . Here 's your soup , Peggy . Now take it to your desk carefully and do n't spill any . What 's the matter with you , Fenny ? Why are n't you in line ? " From the corner beside the door , Fenny Jones shook an angry fist at Charley Washburn . " He wo n't tell me how his father makes them big fishhooks , " he cried tearfully . " He thinks just ' cause he 's white he doan need to tell a colored boy nothing . I 'm goin ' to smash his face in , soon 's we get out o ' this lousy school . " " The hell you will , " shouted Charley , jumping out of linep108belligerently . " An ' do n't go using double negatives , you dumb nigger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daisy . " You two boys shake hands right now , " commanded Jill . " And then , Charley , you tell him about the fishhooks  --  all about them . When Fennimore understands , you can both have your soup  --  but not before . " " He 's too dumb to understand , " grumbled Charley . " So that means I wo n't never get no soup . " " Triple negative ! Triple negative ! " yelled Lucia Caselli . " Do n't let them get you down , Daisy , " smiled Jill . " I think it 's splendid that you 're willing to substitute for Maddy . I 've got to take a hospital requisition up to the office , and I 'll tell her you 've got everything under control . " " If you can say that , you 'll say anything , " responded Daisy , with a rueful smile . The office of the Gumption Island Corporation had been designed as one big room , filling most of the second floor , above the schoolroom and what had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor rambles out into locker rooms and the office shops of the golf and tennis pros . The building , across Bayswater Drive from the club and club cottage , was never an architectural triumph . But it had been little damagedby the bomb explosion and now , nine weeks later , was serving as the seat of government . Administrative headquarters , as Jill climbed the narrow stairs and passed the alcove that had served as post office , seemed as crowded as , though less noisy than , the schoolroom below . On the north side , bent busily over the opposite sides of a table by the window , Vladimir Polyvanov and Madeleine Buchanan were working hard with India ink . Albert Adler , sitting at the inner side of the table , checked their finished product , marking each note that passed muster with a hieroglyphicAA . Several piles of cardboard , predominantly green but with red , yellow , blue , and white also showing , lay atp109the elbows of the craftsmen . Carefully cut to banknote size they suggested the magnitude of the task before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the room , sat Gregory Waynfleet , erstwhile manager of the club , now secretaryto the Directorate , studying his ledgers under the cracked but unbroken skylight . To his right , by the south windows , pretty little Alice Edminster was typing competently . In the corner back of her seventeen-year-old stepgranddaughtersat youthful Mrs. Edminster , studying the list of survivors and transferring names to five separate sheets of paper . From a partitioned corner , corresponding in size to the deserted post office , came the disputatious voices of Doggy Venable and Walter Travis . And on a bench by the entrance , silent and equally bored , sat a most incongruous trio : PercivalCauldwell , the elderly , aesthetic organist of the BoneberryConservatory of Music ; Basil Agonistes , young and dapper ; between them the towering , muscular figure of Bill Jefferson . Jill Clendenning paused at the entrance , smiled at ProfessorCauldwell as he rose and bowed courteously , then walked quickly to Waynfleet 's desk . " A requisition from the hospital , Greg , " she said . " Dr. Lawson asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent . " Waynfleet 's worried face relaxed only momentarily as he looked up at Jill and motioned her to a chair beside his desk . " Two whole bags , " he complained , examining the paper . " Could n't you get along with one for the rest of this week ? Our entire reserve "  --  he turned the pages of a neat loose-leaf folder beside him  --  " is only four bags . And Mr. Buchanan alone has a requisition in for six . He 's built a little furnace and thinks he can smelt iron out of some ore he 's collected . " Polyvanov , who had been listening intently from across the room , rose suddenly . " We do n't think we do it , " he shouted . " We know we do it . That ore is haematite of most superior quality . Mr. Buchanan assays it at least 50 per centp110iron . It is pre-Cambrian rock , blown to the surface when I hit your subcrustal fissure . We must advantage our opportunitiesand not fall over bag of charcoal ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast . You can not dispose of our precious charcoal  --  which I burned myself  --  Mr. Waynfleet ! " For a moment the manager was taken aback . Then , smiling at Jill , " I 'll recommend your requisition to the Directorate tonight , " he said . " As for you , Mr. Polyvanov , if you want to work in this office , kindly mend your manners . " The Russian started to speak again , but Madeleine , also on her feet , pressed him back to his seat . " Do n't get so excited , Polly , " said Dr. Adler softly . " If you believe in the planned economy you should n't be upset by its manifesta-tions . " " It is not planned economy , " muttered Polyvanov , taking up his pen again , " to place consideration for the sick ahead of the needs of basic industry . Or , at least , that is not wellplannedeconomy . " " Thanks very much , Greg , " said Jill . " I 'll get back to my job then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than I can say for the school . Integration does n't seem to be working too well . But Daisy 's doing a swell job , Madeleine . " Waynfleet walked with Jill to the door , pressed her hand warmly , and then stopped by the men idling on the bench . " You three are on the service roster for assignment , " he said . " We must produce more charcoal whether this iron smelting makes sense or not . You know that job , Bill . Will you take it ? " " Ah done burned all the charcoal that Mister Polly ai n't made hisse'f , " protested the big Negro . " Ah figure Ah 'm much mo ' he'pful in field work . But if yo ' says go , why ob course Ah goes , Mister Waynfleet . " " I should be happy to take that job , " interposed Agonistes . " What I hear about Mr. Buchanan 's project interests me . But , if so , I would like to be assigned the rest of the day there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags . Okeh , then , Mr. Agonistes . Bill , I was holding you for a call from Tony Caselli , but none has come in . So I guess you 'd better clear with Walter Travis as to what you 'll do next . Professor Cauldwell , do you mind waiting awhile ? We ought to have at least one man in reserve here . " " I would as soon sit here as anywhere on this blasted island , " said Percival Cauldwell resignedly . " May I sit with you for a moment then ? " asked Father Brown , who had slipped in unobtrusively after a whispered talk with Jill in the passage . " Alphabetically , I should have seen Cauldwell before Clendenning , but the order is really unimportant . " " I 'm afraid I do n't understand you , Father . " " Well , frankly , I 'm electioneering . You know the system under which the delegates will be chosen , next Sunday ? " " I understand that we 're all divided into groups according to the first letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think best in that group . There 's a notice posted at the entrance and I believe Mrs. Edminster over there is now making up a sort of scrutin de liste . My group is A to C inclusive . It seems rather small . " " Oh , just think of Banks , Bailey , Baker , Bryson , Buchanan , and other busy bees . May I suggest Brown , as a good middle-of-the-road candidate in your group ? " " Why certainly , Father , you can have my vote . I really had n't given the matter any thought . It 's all so depressing here now . " " It will be a lot more depressing , " said Father Brown , " if we do n't get something better than our present government , and get it soon . " He turned his head sharply as a stumbling , panting noise grew louder on the stairway . " What next , I wonder , " groaned Percival Cauldwell , also looking apprehensively at the doorway . Through it staggered the scarcely recognizable figure of Perry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slime ; clothing half-torn from his slim , brown body ; bloodp112trickling from an ugly gash across one of his unshaven cheeks . " Mistah Venable ! " he cried , then collapsed gasping on the floor . " Alice , go get Dr. Griffin , " ordered Walter Travis , emergingfrom the presidential sanctum . " Lift him into your chair , Greg . " " I 've got some brandy in my desk , " said Venable . He was back in a moment with half a tumbler . Perry gulped a swallow , then feebly pushed the glass away . " I 'm okeh , " lie muttered , between deep , panting breaths . " I 'm jes ' pooped . I 've run from down below the cliffs . " " Well over a mile , " said Father Brown , wiping Perry 's disfigured face tenderly with a moistened handkerchief . " The Colonel , he 's shot a Dinahshore down there , and killed him daid , " cried Perry , pulling himself upright in his chair . " He 's standing guard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Colonel sent me back fo ' to git help . " " Do you mean Colonel Showalter , Perry ? " asked Travis . " Here , have another drink . " " Yassuh . Colonel Showalter hisse'f . " The boy took anotherswallow of spirit . Then the story poured forth . " I has my ' structions to join him early this mawnin ' for Dinahshore patrol and he gives me brekfust , with some real sugar in the coffee . We only has .22 rifles and each of us takes ten ca'tridges . The Colonel he tells me he 's sure he 's seen some of them big serpents swimmin ' south of the island , so we goes up to the old Hoffmann house , where they ai n't nobodysince Paul Stoner quit her service and old Mrs. Hoffmann , she went to the hospital . So we stands on the empty po'ch , looking at the water and , sho ' enuf , there 's one of those great snaky things playin ' round not mo ' than a hundred yards to sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvia Edminster . " So Colonel Showalter he say , Perry , we kaint do him no harm from here , not with these pop guns , so let 's go down to the beach . ' And I'se skeered to go an ' mo ' skeered not to go.  |p113So  we clambers down the cliff and when we gets to the foot , jes ' behind some bushes from the beach , there 's that monster , h'istin ' himse'f on his big flippers right out o ' the water . He look like a great snake strung through the body of a ' normous turtle , only he got no shell  --  only giant flipper-flappers . And mah teeth begin to chatter and the Colonel whisper , Shut up , you . ' Then he say , When he turn his head , I 'll plug him in the eye . ' " " The pronouns are highly obscure , " observed Professor Cauldwell . Perry paused and took another drink . " And then , " he continued , " I'se so shaky I lets my gun off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see blood runnin ' but , shucks , that ai n't no mo ' than a sting to him . Then lie swings his head around to see what 's bitin ' and barn , Colonel Showalter ketches him a plug right in the eye , jes ' like he promised  --  Good Lawd above , that was some shootin ' ! And Mr. Dinahshore he rear up and bang about and , fo ' I knew where I is , one of his flippers kotches me wham an ' knocks me twenty feet in the mud . But I ai n't hurt  --  not much . . . " " You do n't seem to be , " said Dr. Griffin from the doorway . " Alice had you as dead as your dinosaur , Perry . She 's fixing a bed for you at the hospital now . " " Well , thank Gawd , Doctor , he 's daid and I ai n't . But Colonel Showalter , he say , You run like hell , Perry . Tell ' em at the office to bring axes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got food and blubber and fat here fo ' to replenish all our stock , if the sharks do n't get ' im off shore . ' And Lawdy , what a shot that was  --  right plumb in his nasty little eye  --  killin ' a Dinahshore with a .22 bullet . Land sakes  --  that 's shootin ' ! I 'll go tell Alice all about it . " " Do n't lay it on too thick , Perry , " advised Father Brown . " Plesiosaurus looks venomous , but I 'm sure is unaggressive and harmless . " " Anyway , " said Walter Travis , " we 'd better get the oilP114out of him , as Reggie suggests . Bill , there 's your afternoon'swork , all set . Professor Cauldwell , will you assist ? " " When I said I would remain here in reserve , " said ProfessorCauldwell tragically , " I certainly did not anticipate that I would be called upon to dissect an antediluvian plesiosaur ! "   " THE FIRST QUESTION we considered , " said Father Brown , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighting of the club dining-room was much improved . Oil lamps , long treasured on Gumption Island because of occasional hurricane interference with electrical supply , burned warmly in every corner . Candles shed extra illuminationacross the table where the members of the Constitutional Convention sat facing their constituents , two at the left and three at the right of Doggy Venable as presiding officer . There was even special decoration for the occasion  --  jars of deep red chrysanthemums and autumn-stained blueberry leaves on the long table ; a festoon of gay-colored internationalsignal flags , the property of Peter Clarke , behind it . Whimsical Pete had strung the appropriate letter flags back of the place of each elected delegate : A  --  C for Father Brown ; D  --  G for Gilbert Edminster ; H  --  K for Bill Jefferson ; L  --  S for Louella Lawson and T  --  Z for Walter Travis . Behind the chairman hung a large burgee of the defunct yacht squadron . " We had quite an argument , " the priest continued , " over this primary issue . We agreed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the peace , so that people may go about their lawful occasions within a frameworkof order . Bill Jefferson especially emphasized that government is also set up to secure justice . But that does n't requirebureaucracy . I recalled St. Augustine 's teaching that justice is not secured by laws , but rather by individual observance of the principle that every man should receive his due . "  | " Amen , " cried Sadie Banks fervently , from her front seat in the A  --  C section . " So we began our constitution-building with the thought that the power and functions of the island government should be severely limited , in order to stimulate self-development . This is certainly not in accord with the dominant political theory in the world we have left . It 's not in accord with the emergency system set up after the explosion . But that has bogged down , I think everybody agrees . " " And how ! " interjected I ) r . Griffin . " It could be shown , " Father Brown went on , " that all mankindwas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the twentieth century . Your committee would rather emphasize our present opportunity . It is to establish on Gumption Island something akin to the Greek city-state . Here , as there , every citizen knows all his neighbors . Here , as there , we are necessarily self-sufficing . Here , as there , the affairs of an integrated community are the concernof every member . Consequently , here , as there , the magistrates  --  if I may use an old-fashioned word so much happier than officials  --  should be strictly accountable to the citizens and held to accountability by them . " Vladimir Polyvanov , sitting glumly between Alicia Phillipsand Paul Stoner , stirred uneasily . Father Brown glanced at the Russian and raised his voice : " It is said that the Greek polis was never in fact an ideal form of government ; that it was based on slavery and was too small and powerless for great accomplishment . All right . We have no slavery here . We can demonstrate that achievementdoes not depend on numbers . Let us , then , improve on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It is our opportunity to build the City of God ! " Colonel Showalter , sandwiched between his wife and Jenny Stokes , could contain himself no longer . " I would have thought our own American Constitution a sufficiently good model , " he boomed . " G.I.S.S.R. , " muttered Vladimir .   " Of course , we have kept the fundamental American principles , " retorted Father Brown . " Indeed , we seek to restore and vitalize those principles . But please remember that the essential problem of the men who wrote the Constitution of the United States was to form a federal republic . The union was one of already self-governing communities . It was never anticipated that the formula used would be so twisted as to destroy local self-government . Fortunately , we can learn from this American tragedy . We can prevent usurpation of power here because our problem is the promising one of creating an ideal governmental entity from scratch . " Commander Polyvanov leapt to his feet . " That , " he cried , " is exactly why you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will surely be the end of all political evolution ! As you suggest , your own United States was alreadygoing Communist , even without the war you forced ! " Cries of " order , " " keep quiet , " and " throw him out " rang through the big room . Doggy Venable rose and tapped smartly with his gavel . " We have called this community meeting , " he said , " to hear the report of the elected drafting committee , from Father Brown as its authorized spokesman . There will be ample opportunity to question him , or any other delegate , after the report . We shall not vote on the proposed constitutionfor another week . I must insist that there be no further interruptions . " " Then let 's have less preaching and more explanation , " interjected Ken Bryson . " The rebuke is well taken , " replied Father Brown meekly . " But I was requested to emphasize why we have severely limited the province of government here on Gumption Island  --  so that there can be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have already examined the copy of the proposed constitution as tacked on the bulletin board . Greg Waynfleet has five other copies  --  the ones your drafting committee has here tonight  --  available for further study.1'The Gumption Island Constitution as adopted is printed as an appendix.  |p120My  assignment was only to explain the general purpose of this instrument of government . " " Well , get on with it then , " shouted Bryson angrily . " I 've finished , " responded the priest , unexpectedly taking his seat . Walter Travis , intercepting the chairman 's nod , rose promptly . " As you have in effect been told , " he said , " we decided that the fewer legislative acts and the fewer officials we have , the better . We suggest an elected council of five  --  men or women  --  of course not necessarily your deputies here now . That council will combine the legislative and administrativefunctions , distributing the latter among its members . It will elect its own chairman-president , serving a year , who will have neither precedence nor extra power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council , to be chosen from the same alphabetical groups we have established , will come up for re-election annually . Monday , November 1 , three weeks from tomorrow , is the date set for our first general election , assuming prior ratification of the constitution . " " Whatever Mr. Travis wants , " whispered old George Garvey to Dr. Griffin , " is okeh by me . " " You see , " Walter proceeded , " that the council is designed to have a great deal of administrative freedom , but within a very limited legislative sphere . Please note that all monetary and fiscal matters , whether of currency , appropriation , or taxation , are delegated to a Bank of Gumption Island , under two managers . They will be elected separately from a panel to be presented by the council , immediately following its own election . This is to protect our money from such governmentaldebauchery as was practiced in the United States . " " You assume this arbitrary constitution will be adopted ? " inquired Roy Wilson from the back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do , " replied Walter imperturbably . " For one reason , because the council is not empowered to make any enactments affecting wages , prices , hours and conditions of labor , or nature of employ-P121ment . We propose an absolutely free market , by contrast with our present controlled economy . Religious organization and observance , as under the American Constitution , Reggie , will similarly be wholly outside the province of civil government . So will education . So will the postal system , if we develop one . " " That 's my chance , " whispered Perry Warren to Greg Waynfleet . " The police power , " Travis continued , " will vest in the council . Our sheriff , under the councillor in charge of securitymatters , will be one of the two full-time employes of the government . The other will be the recorder . We shall have one justice of the peace , also elected annually , like the bank directors , from a panel presented to the community by the council . This J.P . will have power to interpret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the peace of the island . His sentences , however , will be subject to jury trial and to appeal and review by the council . The power to pardon or commute sentences will vest in its chairman . " That 's a bare summary of our plan , which seems simple , but for that very reason has taken us six weeks of discussion . There 's one more point , which Father Brown will emphasize . " " Briefly , I hope , " said Ken Bryson audibly . " So briefly that I need not rise , " acknowledged the priest . " This constitution is in the nature of a social contract . In the words of Bobby Macpherson , it 's a covenant among ourselves . Therefore , it will not become effective unless ratified by two thirds of the electorate , which is composed of every islander eighteen and over including Colonel Polyvanov . Furthermore , anyone who does not wish to be a citizen of Gumption Island is free to move to the uninhabited fifty-acre islet , which will be extraterritorial . A proportionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to any who so elect . Now , I think , Doggy , we 're ready for questions . "   " I guess it 's off-island for me , " muttered Vladimir Polyvanovmorosely to Alicia Phillips . " I saw your hand first , Sidney , " said the corporation president . " I must emphasize that this is a question period  --  no speeches , please . " Judge Anderson rose from his place on the left of the front row , and faced towards Walter Travis at the far end of the long table . " I have studied the proposed constitution , " he said precisely . " It 's ingenious and promising . I hope it will be adopted . But there is one question  --  Walter discussed it with me  --  which does not seen to me well settled , and which I therefore direct to him . The justice of the peace is to be elected from a panel of three citizens nominated by the council . It is assumed that he will have a thorough knowledge of the common law , for he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voters know whether this sweeping assumption is justified , when they come to elect ? " At a nod from the chairman , Walter got up , drew a P.J.H. candle closer to his papers , and thoughtfully fondled his sprouting beard . " Sid , " he acknowledged , " your question is the more importantbecause it applies equally , or almost equally , to the bank managers . They also are nominated by the council , and it 's certainly assumed they 'll have more than average financial competence . " " But the point is stronger in the case of the justice , " expostulatedJudge Anderson , " partly because the common law is more a matter of precedent than is any particular financial policy ; partly because this constitution divides the financial power between two men , while the judicial power is vested in one . " " Dr. Adler and I are really responsible for the formula , " admitted Travis . " He made the point that in Washington , leaving Congress out , financial power is also divided between two men  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governors of the Federal Reserve System . Those two officials must agree , as our two bank managers must agree . On the judicial side , in the United States , the power of decision in the last analysis also narrows down to a single though an indefinite person  --  that justice of the Supreme Court who personally makes the majority in a five to four opinion . So we have good precedent in dividing the financial and concentrating the judicial power . " " If I may interpolate , " said Father Brown , " there is also a fundamental distinction between the two fields . The objectivesare wholly different . The goal of judicial power , in government , is unqualified justice . Justice is absolute so must be dispensed , under safeguards , according to the conscientiousjudgment of one man . But the goal of financial power , in government , is merely social and economic stability , which is not an absolute , but a relative , matter . What is relative is properly a matter of controversy . Therefore , it is seemly to balance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " So long as its conduct is kept wholly free from political influence , which it never has been , in the United States , " cried Dr. Adler . Chairman Venable rapped smartly with his gavel . " No unauthorized comment , if you please , " he said . " Sidney , is your question answered ? " " Only in part . You explain why there should be a division of financial and a concentration of judicial power . You do n't explain how you expect to get the best-qualified man for any professional position by the clumsy process of election . Personally , I 've always mistrusted the election of judges . And please do n't think I 'm talking from any personal viewpoint . If anyone is thinking of me as justice of the peace , I hope he 'll change his mind . The position looks like one long and unrequited headache . I predict it 'll turn out to be a full-time job , and those of the bank managers too , most likely . " " The question , " summarized Doggy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of appointing them top124office . Walter has cleared the way for the answer . So please keep it short , Father Brown . " The little priest bobbed up again , peering benignly over his frayed and dingy clerical collar . " The system proposed , " he said , " combines the virtues of professional selection and democratic choice . We can reasonably assume that the freely elected council will only nominate qualified men to the two panels . Then it 's up to the citizens to choose between those who are regarded as equally , or almost equally , competent . I would emphasize the reciprocal nature of the arrangement . The power to nominate is placed in the hands of an elected council . But the selection among the limited number of nomineesreverts to the people again . Nobody knows better than Judge Anderson that the bar associations favor judicial appointments from panels approved by them . " " The whole procedure is as cumbersome as our requisition system , " commented Mrs. Bryson . " Do n't confuse politics and economics , Elise , " retorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The elections safeguard political freedom . In Russia , they 've simplified politics and made economic life cumbersome . We prefer to have politics complicated and business uncontrolled . " " No more debate , " decreed the chairman , looking away from Polyvanov 's furiously waving hand . " That 's quite enough on that particular point . In fairness , we must take up other issues . Ed Bailey , I saw your hand up a while back . " The old boat builder and carpenter rose stiffly . " I 'm just a countryman , " he said . " I 've never given much thought to this business of government , so mebbe my question ai n't very bright . But I always understood people should be represented in the House of Delegates , or Congress , according to where they live . This here proposed system , Mr. Venable , would represent us according to the spelling of our names . Can anybody up at the table explain that , to help a fellow who ai n't done much reading ? "  | " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll pass it to Bill Jefferson . " Fenny Jones turned his head to the ear of Annabelle , beside him . " Bill 's gettin ' mighty smooth , since the white folks took him up , " he whispered . But Annabelle only frowned . Her husband , looking gigantic and unusually presentable in his Sunday clothes , was wholly unembarrassed . " That business of votin ' by names did n't make no sense to me neither , when it come up , " he said . " But Ah finally got it through mah thick head , Mr. Bailey . Fust of all , here on the island we ai n't got land divisions , like counties , ' cept between us and the piece off-island which we ai n't goin ' to try to govern . So there war n't no sense in makin ' divisions just for the fun of havin " em . " " Got mo ' divisions than makes sense already , " muttered Sadie . " Then , if we had set up districts , all the help over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property owners in the others . It 's mo ' fair to divide folks up by names than by how they lives . Take me  --  Ah got a po ' house but a good name . So I votes as Jefferson , wid the H to I 's , and not jes ' wid mah colored neighbors . You can read how we'se fixed it in the constitution that if we gets too many J 's , like Timmyus and Crityus Jefferson that 's comin ' along , why then we redistricts the letters like they redistricted Maryland after the last census . It seems to me a right smart plan , Mr. Bailey . " " Very well put , Bill , " said the chairman . " Roy , I 'm not overlooking you just because you 're in the shadows back there . What 's your question ? " " It is n't directed to what the proposed constitution actuallysays , " explained the former chairman of the golf committee , " but to what it seems to imply . So you 'll have to decide who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , whatever it is , " retorted DoggyP126Venable , a little irritably . " We ca n't discuss this all night , you know . " " I do n't know that , " replied Roy Wilson with equal acerbity . " I think this is a mighty important meeting , for everybody on the island . You ca n't just railroad this constitutionthrough ; less so if you regard it as a solemn covenant . " At the applause for this sally , the chairman rapped angrily with his gavel . " Proceed , then , Mr. Wilson , " he growled . " This constitution , " said Roy slowly , " ostensibly protects private property . Actually , it 's confiscatory . What I happen to own here on the island  --  my house and lot , my furniture , some golf clubs , and an equally useless station wagon  --  is mine , to do with as I want . But everything I own elsewhere  --  that 's all wiped out . " " Well , is n't it anyhow ? " inquired Venable petulantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore than I have in Washington . My lumberyard there is gone , so far as I 'm concerned . " " Let me make my point , Doggy , " protested Wilson . " I guess I ca n't do it without seeming to be a little personal . Take Buck Buchanan here , or Phillips , or Brady . Buck owns a big piece of good land , and so do Tom and Bill . I paid about as much for my sandy bayside lot , because of its water view . What 's a view of the ocean worth now ? " Then take Ed Bailey , or Greg Waynfleet , or Bill Jefferson . They , and quite a few more , not only have their rented homes here , but regular jobs too . I guess they 'll be able to carry on about as they always have . But I 've lost my business , my savings , and the value in my investment here . I 'm not complaining especially . Evie and Peggy and I will managesomehow . But it seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . I 'd like to know whether our Founding Fathers gave due considerationto these inequities . " The room fell wholly silent . Venable consulted his notes . " Mr. Edminster , " he said after a pause , " I guess that ques-P127tion falls to you . You 're listed as answering personal com-plaints . " The elderly architect rose , removed his glasses , carefully pocketed the case and spoke into the flickering shadows . " We did n't examine your situation particularly , Roy , " he said . " But we talked for a whole week about the problem of how to make a fresh start without being unfair to anybody . " We had set ourselves a high objective : to establish a classlesssociety , in which government would be reduced to an absolute minimum , in which private property should be protected , not as an end in itself , but as a means for individual and collective betterment . Then we came right up against this problem that you raise  --  should we try to make an even start for all or should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lost when we were blown right off the map ? " We discussed that up and down and decided everyone would have to take his losses , whatever they are . We could n't do anything for those who were killed . We could n't go along with the suggested plan of capitalizing on vanished investments . Mrs. Lawson put it very well at one of our meetings . Will you repeat that , Lu ? " The audience listened attentively to Louella 's soft voice . " I merely suggested , " she said , " that most of the trouble after the first World War came from reparations  --  from efforts to escape the general social loss involved . The socalledstatesmen said it would only be necessary to blame the Germans for everything  --  then make them pay . Of course , the injustice of that attitude produced Hitler and World War II . Now it 's the third strike and out  --  for us at least . So I further said that this time I hope nobody here holds Commander Polyvanov personally responsible . I 'm glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemy alien , but a Gumption Islander like the rest of us . " Both Reggie Showalter and Vladimir Polyvanov , sitting a few seats apart , raised protesting hands . But Gil Edminster resumed swiftly : " Thanks , Lu . So we concluded that this time the onlyp128thing is to cut our losses , of every kind ; concentrate on trying to recoup them , co-operatively . And , Roy , I think the plan of leaving everyone just what they have here  --  and turning all the corporation assets over to the proposed republic  --  is more equitable than you realize . " If it seems to favor Ed Bailey , Bill Jefferson and some others , that 's because their whole stake was in this island . That 's also the case with those who 'd retired here , and of course we 'll have to do something for people , like old Mrs. Hoffmann , who are no longer competent to work . The council can provide relief , so long as the expenditure is covered by revenue . I 'm no longer young , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as they are . Personal talents are real prop erty , and if they were really valuable in the society we 've left , they should also be valuable in the society we 're trying to create . We 've got good evidence of that . Consider what our doctors have done for us already . " " Bless the Lawd , " cried Sadie Banks . " Just one thing more , and I apologize for talking so much . But Dr. Adler here  --  a visitor to the island with one handbagand , by good fortune , a beltful of gold dollars  --  Dr. Adler has contributed all that gold to our common cause and thereby , we think , provided the basis of solution for our monetary problems . I feel that we owe Albert Adler a standingvote of thanks ! " " So ordered , " said Doggy Venable , as the whole assembly rose with a storm of applause . " And now that you 're up , we 'll have a ten-minute break before we resume the interrogation . There are pails of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over two big baskets of apples . Fenny , will you and Charley Washburn see that the older people get served first ? " Dr. Griffin politely ushered Annabelle Jefferson to her chair , eyeing her professionally as she sat down heavily . " An apple a day wo n't keep the doctor away in your case , Anna-P129belle , " he said . " Did Dr. Lawson set a date for you to come to the infirmary ? " " Yas , suh . He say with Timmyus and Crityus acting up the way they is , Ah 'd better move over next Sunday , a week f'om today . I'se got to come over then , anyhow , to vote fo ' dis yere constitution . Dr. Lawson tole me to keep off mah feet as much as Ah kin . But that ai n't so easy , wid Estelle scamperin ' about and Bill busy as he is from sun-up to mid-night . " " And how old is Estelle , now ? " " She was five jes ' befo ' the ' splosion , Doctor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope she 's still thataway . Oh , here we goes again ! " The buzz of conversation halted as Venable smote the table sharply with his gavel . " The meeting will please come to order , " he said . " Dr. Griffin , since you 're standing , you may have the floor . I noticed your hand was up before I called the recess . " " Er  --  yes , " replied the young physician , turning away from Annabelle to face the chair . " I do have a question . It 's partly in the field of morals , so I 'll address it to Father Brown , as Mrs. Lawson suggested I should . " Pausing for a moment , Griffin looked meditatively at the shadowy ceiling above the head table . " Under the proposed constitution , " he continued , " our little infirmary , in a building owned by the corporation , will become the property of the bank and will be operated as a trust for the people . I assume the community will want this hospital to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Lawson and myself , or of Dr. Washburn , or of Mrs. Lawson and our part-time nurses . Our medical work will not be under the government , even though the infirmary itself is government property . Are we supposed to charge patients whatever we think proper ? If so , do we tailor the charge to the time spent on each case , or to the economic circumstances of the patient , or what ? " Doggy Venable looked inquiringly at Father Brown . Thep130latter looked at Walter Travis and smiled . Walter grinned back , with a conceding gesture . The priest rose , scratching his nose thoughtfully . " The point you make , Dr. Griffin , " he said , " applies to other professional work . For instance , when the justice of the peace sits in judgment the place where he holds court will , or should , be government property . But he will not be a full-time , salaried official . You might inquire whether he will charge for his services in proportion to the magnitude of the sentences he imposes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anderson audibly . " In the case of the justice , " continued Father Brown urbanely , " I think we can assume that the council will fix a reasonable per diem compensation . And there is some analogy between the dispensation of justice and that of medical care . A good many people think that public health is just as much a governmental function as is public order . One member of this delegation argued quite persuasively that we should have a full-time health officer , as well as a full-time police officer . " " I still think so , " said Louella Lawson . " But the eventual decision was opposed . The American medical profession , as none knows better than Dr. Griffin , has always been distinguished for social conscience as well as professional skill . We are fortunate in the representation of that profession on Gumption Island , and we think we should leave the matter of charges in the hands of our own doctors . The council will have to decide whether they shall pay rent to the extent that they practice privately at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per diem compensation for public service , as in the case of the J.P . " " As trustees , " commented Dr. Adler , " the bank managers will certainly expect to be consulted . " " But all that , " objected Dr. Griffin , " is n't spelled out very clearly in the draft constitution . " " A written constitution , " said Travis , rising slowly , " is n't supposed to spell out individual conduct . It merely lays downp131certain governing principles . In economic matters , this constitutionclearly establishes the principle of the free market . In a free market , what people desire to sell and what people desire to buy come into balance at a certain point . That point of balance is the agreed price . The same is true of wages , which are merely the price of personal services , skilled or unskilled . Is that correct , Dr. Stevens ? " " It 's good classical theory , " assented the young economics professor , from the back row of the gathering . " Of course a Socialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the determination of price . " " Well , " said Walter , " the present necessity of all of us here now is , obviously , increased production . We think that this constitution will help because it eliminates artificial impedimentsand leaves people free to produce . I expect there 'll be plenty of demand for medical service , Dr. Griffin , and what you charge wo n't be regulated by law . It will be settled by the market , modified by the dictates of your own con-science . " " With your permission , " asserted Father Brown , " I would emphasize that conscience is really the balance wheel of the free economy . It is n't merely shortsighted to charge exorbitantly , or to give less return for wages than your talents permit . It 's also morally wrong . So , if political government has to intervene , to control prices or wages , it means that self-government has broken down . The state then substitutes its police power for the inoperative power of individual conscience . At best , that 's a clumsy expedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Soviet Russia  --  the displacement of God by the state , the calculated elimination of Christian love and charity by a ruthless dictatorship . " Choking with anger , Commander Polyvanov leapt to his feet . " Mr. Chairman , " he shouted , " I have listened patiently to much absurdness . But these calculated insults to the Socialist Fatherland I can not more tolerate . I pity Mr. Travis , with his childish chatter of free economy . But your priest is different . He is dangerous . He uses mythology andp132superstition as weapons to block the progress of humanity . I am grateful for many kindness some have given me . I would like helping build a Soviet republic here . But Communists can not work with priests . Colonel Showalter has my parole . When you want you will find me what you call off-island . To my friends , I thank ; to your priest  --  I spit ! " With fists clenched and face livid , the Russian officer strode from the room . Madeleine Buchanan , after a moment 's agitatedhesitation , hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled back by the firm grasp of his wife , sputtered with indignation . " Oh , Lawd , " cried Sadie Banks fervently , " please to bring dese yere white folks to they senses . " Calmly , amid the wild commotion , Father Brown turned to nonplussed Doggy Venable . " I think , Mr. Chairman , " he said quietly , " it would be well to call the meeting back to order . " " Before the interruption , " observed Doggy , looking plaintivelyat his broken gavel , " Mr. Caselli had his hand up . Tony , do you still have a question ? If so , please try not to be controversial ! " " Thanks , Mr. Venable , " said the former contractor , wipingsmall beads of perspiration from his forehead with a bright bandanna handkerchief . " I do n't want to start no argument , and I certainly do n't want nobody to call me a Commie . But I do want to follow that point made by Roy Wilson . He asked whether we should keep real property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; some , like me , with just small lots ; some not owning no land at all . " I do n't think that question got answered ; anyhow , not to my satisfaction . The way I see it , land is the source of all wealth . Father Brown said we want to be democratic . But you ca n't be democratic if a few people own most of the land . That 's how it was in Italy . That 's how all this European feudalism got started . So why do n't our constitution fix it to tax a man according to the land he owns , rather than accord/ing to his income ? Would n't that be a lot more fair and American ? " " Gil , " said the chairman , " I guess that 's for you . " " I 'm wondering , Tony , " responded Gilbert Edminster thoughtfully , " whether you ever read Progress and Pov-erty ? " " Sure I did , when I was a youngster . My old man knew it pretty nearly by heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had it framed . We was all single-taxers in our family . I guess maybe that 's one reason why I went into the contracting business . " " You mean , " inquired the architect , " that you felt it especiallyimportant to improve the land , and therefore decided to devote your life to that purpose ? " " Well , Mr. Edminster , I do n't want to pose as no idealist . But I think you might say what you said . " " We ought to understand , " continued Edminster , " what worried Henry George . He believed that monopoly , and monopoly values , spring from holding land idle out of circulation , as you might say . So he proposed one single tax , replacing all others , to be levied on what he called the bare land , ' regardless of the value of the improvements in it or on it . He figured that would n't be a tax on production . " " Would you call a parking lot bare land ? " inquired Daisy Crashaw . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot is in use  --  if you 're talking of how things were . Henry George only wanted to hit the people who do n't use their land productively . They 'd have to pay for keeping other people off . He wanted to tax a vacant lot , held for a high price , just the same as if it was occupied by a grocery store . That makes good sense to me , and that 's why I 'm wondering whether we should n't try the single tax here on Gumption Island . " " Mr. Chairman , " interrupted Dr. Adler , rising abruptly , " may I speak to that for a moment ? This whole question of taxation is fundamental and we 're not really getting to the heart of the important point that Tony raises . "  | " If the rest can take it , I suppose I can , " replied Venable amiably . " As a matter of fact , I 'm interested in this matter of idle land myself . I 've had to be , in the lumber business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd like to say first that I 've read Progress and Poverty myself . It made a great impression on me , as a young man . Let me recall the setting . " Shortly after the Civil War , Henry George , in New York , saw the value of land going up by leaps and bounds , merely because the demand was strong in a strategic area narrowly limited by Nature . He was shocked by the profits of landowners , made without any commensurate service . And he reasoned that the state would be justified in confiscating all this unearned increment by taxation . He had three incontestablepoints : First , ownership of land is certainly the historic basis of social and political power ; second , the supply of land , on this earth , is unquestionably limited , so in theory at least it has a scarcity value ; third , a tax on unimprovedland is not a tax on production , and therefore does n't restrict production . Tony , do I summarize the theme of Progress and Poverty fairly ? " " Very fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me where 's the joker , if any ? " " The joker , " resumed Dr. Adler slowly , " is found in the fact that the power to tax is the power to destroy . Like all Socialists , Henry George blandly assumed that you can eliminate injustice by taking power from people as citizens and placing it in the hands of people as officials . If the second quarter of the twentieth century taught us anything , it is that this cure is worse than the disease . " " The single tax , " Ken Bryson cut in , " is just a special form of price fixing . In time , it would substitute state ownershipof land for all the little landlords Tony dislikes . " " That 's true , " affirmed Dr. Adler . " And the eventual land monopoly would n't solve the scarcity problem because , by nature , a monopoly tends to restrict rather than to produce . Let me point out that the only monopoly we plan  --  that of the bank  --  is frankly designed to restrict the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You mean that hard money encourages hard work ? " queried Caselli . " Of course it does , " Travis answered . " If our friend Polyvanovhad not left , I think he would tell us that Soviet Russia has seized on the theories of Henry George , more resolutely than on those of Karl Marx . Henry George anticipated collectivefarms , but the Communists have established them . What Henry George did n't anticipate . . . " An interrupting crash in the middle of the room revealed that Fenny Jones , after sleeping quietly for some time , had rolled off his chair . He rose confusedly , rubbing his elbow , and sobbing . " Yo ' wuthless jerk , " cried Annabelle audibly , " is yo ' tryin ' to bust up this impo'tent meeting ? " " Impotent or not , it 's high time to bust it up , " said Doggy Venable , glancing at his watch . " It 's past midnight , and I think we 're all exhausted . It seems to me that Caselli 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . But we do n't vote on the constitution for another week , and the panel members will all be at your service during the interval . Remember that you vote by alphabetical groups , here , next Sunday evening . Judge Anderson , I 'd like to name you and Debby Washburn as tellers . Now , Fenny , if you 've no objection , meeting 's adjourned ! " The woods seemed to move in on Tom and Alicia Phillips as they parted from the Bradys at the junction of Western Way and St. Stephen 's Road . A rising wind stirred the protestingtreetops and forced the dark thicket to ominous rustlings . Tom took his wife 's arm ; tightened the grip of his other hand on the head of his heavy stick . " Now we 're alone , " he said , " just what did you think of the meeting ? " Alicia peered apprehensively into the tangle of vinecoveredundergrowth , quickening her step to that of her hus/band . " I had the impression , " she replied , " that the political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . I noticed that few of the women asked any questions . " " I did n't ask any myself . But that does n't mean I was n't interested . You know , Liss , they did a swell job , drafting that constitution . Of course the test will be the way it works in practice . As Walter explained , all that any constitution does is formulate principles into fundamental law . If suitable to the temperament of the community , those principles work ; if unsuitable , the whole thing breaks down . " " But , Tom , only a few people like you any longer give any thought to principles of government . Most Americans have come to regard government as a service agency . The only question in politics is whether people are getting enough free service . The successful politician does n't waste any time on principles . He simply persuades the voters that he 'll give them more , for free , than the other guy . " " That 's precisely why I like what we 're doing here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I see two ways in which it meets problems for which the Constitution of the United States proved inadequate . It takes the money power away from the Administration , so that no official or candidate can promise the people something for nothing . And it practically prevents the building of localized political machines , simply by dividing the voters into alphabetical , rather than geographical , constituencies . " " Bill Jefferson did n't bring out that point . " " No , but he senses the underlying thought . You know , Liss , I 'd like to write some articles , in the vein of The Federalistpapers , explaining why this constitution ought to be ratified . Trouble is , we have n't got a newspaper to publish them and . . . my God ! what 's that ? " From the side of the road ahead , some ten feet above the ground , two close-set green eyes glared malevolently at the couple . Alicia gave a startled cry , then laughed hysterically . " Why , Tom , " she cried . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that tree . See  --  he 's gone now . You canP137hear him climbing . But the way you jumped  --  that almost scared the life out of me ! " " I 'm sorry , Liss . Seeing those eyes  --  higher than my head  --  I thought it must be some huge primeval carnivore . I guess it 's a good reminder not to be too theoretical . You know , Reggie was right in telling Father Brown that we have more to cope with here than just the deficiencies of human nature . " " Well , I do n't like it either , especially with you off somewherealmost every night . Why do n't we go live with George Buchanan ? He 'll be more anxious to have us if Madeleine is really going off-island with that dreadful Russian . I 've never trusted him . I never could , after the cold-blooded way he killed poor Donny . " " Just a minute , Liss . Your pronouns are a bit involved . Brady was saying on the way over , when you were talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join up with them or they with us  --  either way . We might all four move in with Buchanan now . But then what about all this land ? Seemed to me , at the meeting tonight , it was ironic to call me privileged  --  suggest I should be taxed most heavily  --  just because I own enough woodland to make a preserve for dinosaurs ! I 'll trade it off any day for a handpress and a load of newsprint . " " The way Moses traded the Vicar 's horse for a gross of green spectacles , " laughed Alicia . " I 'm enjoying that old book , Torn . I only wish we had more time for reading aloud . The light 's no trouble any longer . Admiral Evans told me tonight they got nearly a hundred gallons from the last batch of porpoises . Yes , it would be wonderful if you could start a weekly paper here , darling . But you ca n't get newsprint out of fish , I 'm afraid . " " No , but you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of them . Then it would certainly be possible to cut wooden type , and I guess one of the carpenters could constructa handpress . I 've got sketches of some early ones , in that history of printing . So I resent your comparison with the Vicar of Wakefield . "   " Then I 'm sorry I made it , dear . You know I have completefaith that you 'll accomplish whatever you set out to do . Let 's emphasize that the Vicar had setbacks even beyond what we have to face . Remember when he brought his poor deceived daughter home , only to find the house spurting fire from every window ? Now here 's our lovely place , black as pitch if you want to look on the gloomy side , but safe and sound and certainly comfortable , even without electricity . " " I do n't know that our difficulties can be laughed off , " said Tom , fumbling for the doorknob . " After all , fifty millionyears is considerable of a setback . Well , thank goodness there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lightwood splinters on the mantelpiece ? " " Right where it should be , Tom . And remember , if we 've gone back fifty million years , we 've also carried back a good sample of the skills that brought us up from whatever our ancestors were then . Did n't I hear you say that this proposedconstitution is in some ways ahead of the one written in Philadelphia , in 1787 ? " As Phillips held a sliver of resinous pine to the glowing embers in the fireplace , his wife unexpectedly burst into a ripple of laughter . Concentrating on the job in hand Tom carried the burning splinter to the old student 's lamp on the living-room table , carefully removed its green shade and glass chimney , watched the ring of flame run swiftly round the circularwick . " I 'm certainly glad you were sentimental enough to keep this family heirloom , " he said . " Now , will you tell me what 's so funny ? " " You make it funnier by referring to your famous grandfather'sstudy lamp , " smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ancestors , in the late Cretaceous period , were little tree-dwelling mammals . I was just wondering whether that creature back on the road was maybe not the raccoon , but your own great-to-the-nth-degree grandfather . " " You , " said Tom , kissing her fondly , " are the one who 's great to the nth degree . "  |p139IT  WAS STILL dark , but a sleepy twittering in the trees on Picnic Point presaged the dawn . The warm breeze from the south raised off-shore ripples to slow the sluggishly breaking waves . Gulls took flight from the beach , and a bevy of little crabs scuttled apprehensively towards the water , as the two men broke from the bushes and clumped heavily through the sand dunes piled on the seaward side of the point . " She 's hid away in the gulley runnin ' up towards that big pine , " said Paul Stoner , in the lead . " Ai n't no more tide to speak of , so I doan pull her up high . She leaks a bit , so yo ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow seat . " " Ah 'll sho ' be glad to res ' it somewheres , " grumbled Steve Douglas .

She ai n't no island boat , I doan think . She mus ' have been cut loose from somewheres in the ' splosion and then driff in here gradual . Talk about Providence ! I had all the fixings collected but jes ' didden know where to set ' em up . Then I finds this boat , with oars an ' all . So the nex ' night I ferries my stuff off-island .

" " Yeah , I brung mah knife , " said Steve , dropping his heavy bag beside the half-buried bow of the boat and flexing his big shoulders . " But I ai n't figuring to do no cuttin ' . That 's bad stuff , Paul . " " Now , lissen , Steve ; I got this from Bill Jefferson , and he knows the sco ' round here . The fac ' truth is that Russian ai n't got no rights . He bus ' out of the big meeting , swearin' ' blue hell at Father Brown , and den he go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted . He 's an outlaw , dat 's what he is . If we has to gut him , ai n't nobody goin ' to say nuthin ' . Come on , help push this boat out . We'se got to git over there befo ' daylight . " A few minutes ' rowing , with Steve at the oars , brought the skiff across to the foot of the raw cliff where the explosion had sheared the fifty-acre satellite from the mainland . Here the land shelved off steeply , with a narrow shore-line fringe of muddy clay . On his one hand , as Steve swung around to back in stern first , a hot spring bubbled and steamed . On the other , a sizeable fall of water cascaded musically down . In between , where great slabs of igneous rock broke through the clay , a semicircular cave some 20 feet in diameter had been gouged out , its interior completely hidden from above by the overhang . " Hop out an ' stow the charcoal and corn in that hole , " Paul ordered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's all hard rock underneath . Jes ' enough slick to pull the boat up right easy . Her bow 'll stick out in de open , but you kin skasely see it from up above . " " How you git up there to look down ? " inquired Steve , gingerly clambering over the grounded stern . " Roun ' the corner where we jes ' come , there 's an easy way up . Then you 's right alongside the of road wha she got bruk off by the ' splosion . The Mansfield house , where the Stokeses was livin ' , where that Russian an ' his gal is campin ' now , isp141hid by the curve . I 'll shin up and make sure they ai n't nobodyfoolin ' roun ' in the meadow up top . You kin study the way I got things arranged . Doan wanner brag , but I ai n't never seen a prettier still  --  an ' I seen lots of ' em in my day . " It was certainly an ingenious contraption . Over a crevice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kettle was carefullywedged . One end of a length of copper tubing was cemented into the spout with china clay . The coil wound across the stone , dipped down into an aluminum pail placed at a lower level , and continued to where its far end was insertedin an empty milk bottle . Beside the kettle stood an enamel water cooler , with close-fitting cover , which Steve Douglas remembered from the clubhouse porch . " Well , Ah 'll be jiggered , " he muttered . " Dat 's de berry cooler Mr. Waynfleet was askin ' about . So Paul done stole it . He sure am unscrupulous . " With gathering interest Steve examined the setup closely , absorbing the significance of its parts . The cooler , as his nose quickly told him , was already in use for fermentation . A ring of froth around it confirmed olfactory evidence . He lifted the cover and sniffed the rancid odor of the bubbling mash within . Then , stepping deeper into the cave , the ex-waiter found a small wooden mallet and pieces of crushed corncob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of empty bottles . One standing by itself , labelled gin , was half full of an appropriatelycolorless fluid . Steve held it to the light , pulled out the stopper and put his nose to the neck . " Doan smell so bad , " he said approvingly . Footsteps outside the cave made him jump guiltily , but the bottle was still in hand as Paul Stoner appeared in the entrance . " You sure ai n't wastin ' no time , " said the latter sharply . " If you 's as quick at distillin ' as you is at drinkin ' , we ought to do pretty good . " " Honest , Paul , " protested Steve , " Ah ai n't teched a drop . Ah wuz jes ' tryin ' to figure did yo ' really make this goodsmellingcorn likker . An ' Ah bin admirin ' how neat yo ' got it all fixed up . Ah ai n't had time to do no mo ' . "  | " Well , go ahead and take a drink . If you 's goin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample the stock in trade . It woan hurt you none , I kin guarantee . I already put away the half of it that ai n't there . " Steve tilted the open bottle and rolled a gulp of the raw spirit round his mouth . Approving the flavor , he swallowed the whole potion and grinned happily as the burn brought tears to his eyes . After a moment , as his breath came back , " Jeese , " he sighed , " that 's strong likker , Paul . We'se goin ' to make our fortunes . " " Not by lappin ' up the stock , we ai n't . Got to work first . Coast is all clear up above , Steve . I scouted down mos ' to the house . That Russian guy , he 's out fishin ' already , down by the landing where they used to load the milk . They 's smoke coming from the chimbley , and I guess the Buchanan gal is fixin ' brekfuss . Time for us to git goin ' . Open that sack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The big kettle , crammed with fermenting mash from the cooler , boiled merrily over the almost smokeless charcoal , forcing the steam through the spout into the coil . At the bottom of the pail , filled to the brim with cold cascade water , the circle of copper tubing gleamed like a golden snake . Condensationsplashed a constant succession of colorless drops into the milk bottle . Steve , from the rock where he was mashingcorncobs , looked longingly at the accumulating homebrew . " How ' bout one mo ' sample , Paul , " he said thickly , " jes ' to balance the weeks Ah bin bone-dry . " The smaller Negro smiled condescendingly . " You 's had four drinks to my one already , " he replied . " You ai n't done no work yet to speak about . I 'm the one who collected all these parts , brung ' em over here and fix ' em together scientific . What sort of partnership is it if I make the hooch and you jes ' guzzles it ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , thatp143bootleggin ' kin get me in bad trouble wid de white folks ; mebbe even wid dat stuck-up nigger , Bill Jefferson . Second place , how kin Ah talk this likker up less Ah knows it 's good from pussonal ' sperience ? You go in business , you 's got to advertise . What Ah drinks here am really advertisin ' . Jes ' one mo ' good swallow , Paul . " " On one condition . You do me a favor an ' you kin ' have another cup . I didden figure to do mo ' today than ' nitiate you anyhow . But first , you fill up that cooler with mash . Stuff takes mo ' than a day to work right , an ' I figured we 'd come back tomorrow night and really start bottlin ' . You kin po ' even drinks now . Then , while you 's doin ' me that favor , she 'll make enuf fo ' a sample to git some orders . " No further invitation was needed . Taking the lid from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its frothing , half-empty interior . Then he filled two cups from the milk bottle , replacing it to catch the continuing drip . Finally , while Stoner watched him closely , the big Negro settled comfortably in the hot sunshine at the edge of the cave , his back against a piece of driftwood . " Ef Ah only had a smoke , " he sighed , " dis would be jes ' Paradise . " " Ain ' no Paradise without women , " contradicted Stoner sharply . " Trubble wid dis here island is , they ai n't no free colored girls , less yo ' count Sadie Banks , an ' she 's got mo ' religionthan sex . Day 's nineteen colored men fo ' only seven females , countin ' two chillun . They 's only five you kin possiblytake to bed . An ' one of them is of Sadie and another is Annabelle Jefferson , who 's jes ' had twins . Gawd , I'se fergettin ' Timmyus and Crityus ! That makes twenty males for eight females , all ages . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ai n't nuthin ' to do ' bout that , " he said resignedly . " We'se got likker now and we'se gettin ' terbacca . That fust crop is mos ' ready for cuttin ' . But yo ' kaint make dames and yo ' kaint grow ' em , neither . Guess we unmarriedmen is jes ' outer luck . " He looked at Paul enviously ,  |p144as  the latter took another sip . " Yo ' sho ' does drink slow , " he added pointedly . " The fac ' truth is , " said the former butler , ignoring the hint , " that I 'm mo ' interested in women than likker . You says you kaint make dames . I says , that 's jes ' what you kin do , if you takes advantage of your opportunities and fergits about color . Steve , you kin have the res ' of my drink if you wants . " His companion eagerly seized the proffered cup , belching loudly as he leaned over . " Dissam all dopperdunity Ah wants , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good liquor doan need no color . " For a minute , while Steve swilled the remainder of the drink , Stoner sat silently . Then he rose and kicked the embers of the fire together . " Guess it 's time fo ' you to do me that favor now , " he said . " Ef you has any mo ' likker , you ai n't never goin ' get up that cliff . " " Whatta wan na clime cliff fo ' ? " Pulling the other roughly to his feet , Stoner spoke emphatically . " Now git this straight , you big souse , " he said . " We'se goin ' up to the Mansfield house . I'se got some bizness with that Buchanan gal . I 've had my eye on her ever since she come to Miz Hoffmann 's fo ' dinner in a low-cut dress . While I 'm inside , you 's goin ' to sit on the do'step and make sho ' I ai n't interrupted . You understand ? " Steve laughed foolishly . " Kin Ah take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You kin have some mo ' when we gets back here in half an hour  --  if you 's done yo ' job proper . Come on now , Steve . You doan have to worry none about that Cornmie outlaw . He ain ' got no mo ' right to dat gal than I have . " With Douglas lurching in front the two men splashed along the muddy beach , then turned inland up a narrow gulley , torn by the explosion , leading steeply to the meadow above . At the curve in the road , where the land sloped down again to the broken causeway , Stoner halted his half-stupefiedcompanion and reconnoitered carefully . A wisp of smoke curled gently up from the chimney hole in the roof of thep145battered cottage ahead . In the distance , at the tip of the sandspit jutting out toward Gumption Island , a fisherman clad only in trunks was casting his line beyond the rim of tumbling surf . The mid-morning sun beat fiercely down on the peaceful scene . " Okeh , " said Paul . " Git across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you can pull it easy . Keep yo ' mouth shut and walk quiet . " On the steps of the porch , Steve , obeying Paul 's strong pressure on his shoulder , sank to a sitting position . He was perspiring profusely . His head swayed from side to side and his thick lips parted in a foolish grin . " Makitsnappy , " he muttered , " Ah wan na li ' 1 mo ' hooch . " Paying no attention , Paul rapped smartly on the door of the cottage , pushed it open , and quickly slipped inside . As his companion disappeared , Steve closed his eyes and leaned back happily . " Paulz hottern me , " he murmured , laughing vacantly . He stretched his legs , rolled heavily to the path , and lay motionless . A gaily colored butterfly dropped from the air and perched picturesquely on the sweat-stained shoulderof his blue cotton shirt . Then it took flight , as the recumbentfigure gave a drunken snore . At the sound of footsteps , Madeleine Buchanan straightenedup from the stove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from electricity was primitive . The broiling compartment now served as fuel chamber , heating both the oven to one side and the useless coils above . A hole cut in the back of the broiler carried a length of tin pipe through the adjacent wall into the flue of the living-room fireplace . The contraption was amateurish and almost as much smoke poured through the joints as was carried up the chimney . In spite of her love for Vladimir , life off-island was proving anything but idyllic . Over in the community , since the explosion , there had certainly been plenty of chores . But mostp146of her time had been given to the school , which was stimulatingand gave a sense of accomplishment . Here , in this battered cottage , it was just an unending round of cleaning , cooking , washing , and grubbing . Vladimir , though considerate and helpful , seemed to take it all for granted . Now he was back early for lunch , half an hour before the fire would be hot enough to fry any fish . She wondered whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been alive ; if she could have counted on somebody more understandingthan her uncle to advise her . Anyhow , Polly must be made to realize that while American girls can work as hard as any , they do not live for that alone . " I 'm not ready yet , Vlad , " she called sharply . " If you want one of your fish for lunch , please scale and clean it outside . Then pull some beets and bring me fresh water . I have n't had time to get any . " But there was no answer and the footsteps , as they came cautiously down the hall , were those of shoes . Vladimir had gone to his fishing barefoot . Madeleine 's bewilderment deepenedas the kitchen door swung open , revealing a small , sharp-looking Negro whom she hazily identified as Connie Hoffmann 's former butler . " Oh ! " she exclaimed . " I thought you were my husband . What do you want ? Who sent you over here ? " Paul Stoner , hands on hips , surveyed her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue slipped out , to caress his unshaven lips . " You ai n't got no husband , honey , " he said . " And you ai n't got no call to stay in this smoky of kitchen now that I 've come to visit . " For a moment Madeleine was too shocked and indignant to speak . Fear and anger competed in her mind as the Negro moved close and she caught the smell of alcohol on his breath . " You 've been drinking ! " she cried . " You do n't know what you 're doing . Get out of here ! Get out , I say ! " A kitchen knife lay in the sink , two steps away . As the girl looked towards it Stoner slipped quickly in between and passed his arm around her waist . " Sho ' I knows what I 'm do-P147in ' , " he laughed . " Come along quiet , honey . We'se goin ' in the bedroom together . " With all her young strength Madeleine slapped him across the face , pulling back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cried at the top of her voice . " Polly , come quick ! Help ! Help ! " At the stinging blow , a savage grimace replaced the Negro 's lascivious grin . He clapped his free hand over the girl 's mouth and swung her violently towards the doorway . " You kin come quiet or you kin come kickin ' , " he grunted . " But you 's comin ' ! " In a whirl of dread and confusion , Madeleine felt herself propelled through the open door along the hall , thence into the ground-floor bedroom that opened off it . The muscles in the arm around her waist felt hard as iron . A sharp knee , rammed into her buttocks , threw her helplessly forward . Instinctively , she bit deeply into the sweaty hand that pressed ruthlessly over her mouth and chin . Stoner cursed at the pain . " You dirty bitch , " he snarled , " you 'll pay for that . " Putting forth all his strength , he flung Madeleine headlongon the double bed . His hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought convulsively to roll away . With mouth uncovered , the girl uttered one still more piercing cry for help . Quickly the Negro pressed a pillow over her head , then threw himself full length on the writhing body . Wing Commander Polyvanov , pleasurably certain that the fish was well-hooked and large , reeled in cautiously . The line swung first up the beach , then down , as his victim darted vainly in the effort to shake free . Winding steadily , the Russianofficer brought the silvery rock through the creamy surf into the shallows . Deftly he pushed two fingers through the gills and heaved the glistening captive out , carefully disentanglingthe hook with his other hand . " At least three kilos , " he calculated , carrying his catch to the basket where two smaller fish lay gasping under a covering of wet seaweed.  |p148Polyvanov  looked at his wrist watch . It was only eleven , an hour before he had said he would return to the house . But he had at least fifteen pounds of rockfish already . The smallest of the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather , the others should be cleaned and sun-dried , preparatory to smoking , without delay . He pulled his razor-sharp Stalingrad dagger from its sheath , planning to clean the fish right there . Then he reflectedthat Madeleine would enjoy seeing at least the big one as it came from its native element . Also , it would be easier to work on the cutting board at the cottage . Heaving the basket to his shoulder Polyvanov started up the broken roadway towards the Mansfield house . And at that moment Madeleine'sanguished cry came to him from round the curve in the road . " Polly , " it sounded faintly , " come quick ! Help ! Help ! " Polyvanov dropped his burden and listened intently . Only the gentle rumble of the surf broke the sultry , slumbrous stillness . Then , swift as a deer , he raced up the gentle slope . Eyes focused on the road , the young Russian leapt lightly over the fissures and piles of rubble remaining from the explosion . And as he ran , his right hand closed firmly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cottage , sprawled halfway across the drive that led up from the county road , a big Negro was lying face down , his head pillowed on his brawny arms . As Polyvanov slowed to look , another terror-stricken cry came through the open doorway . He took the steps to the cottage at a bound , dashed through the hall , and halted for a second at the sight of the twisting , struggling figures in the bedroom . But for a second only , since the meaning and desperate nature of the scene were obvious . In a stride , the Russian was beside the bed . With his left hand he seized Paul Stoner 's kinky wool , jerking his head up and backwards at a horrid angle . Then , even as the rapist cursed , Polyvanov struck home with his dagger , in the soft angle between the jaw and neck . Blood from the severed artery spouted over his arm andp149Madeleine 's naked breasts . In mid-syllable , the blasphemous words on Stoner 's lips changed to a frothy , bubbling shriek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Negro 's thrashing body off the bed , then pulled the pillow from Madeleine'sdistorted , congested face . " Dyevochka , " he gasped , " prastyite daragiya zhena ! " Madeleine opened her eyes . The drawn lines in her face eased a little as she sought to smile . " Oh , Valodya , " she murmured , " just in time . " Her blood-drenched body shuddered and its taut muscles relaxed as the long lashes folded again over her violet eyes . In the trophy room of the club , standing in front of a table piled with his law books , Judge Anderson surveyed the newly-elected members of the Council . " Gentlemen , " he said , " the troublesome fact is that we have absolutely no jurisdictionin this case . " " Oh , come now , Sidney , " protested Colonel Showalter . " You ca n't deny that it 's a serious breach of the peace . I 'm no lawyer . I do n't claim to have analyzed the Constitution the way you have . But at least I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion . Sure this Commie fellow had provocation . Still he committed murder , did n't he ? It 's not only our opportunity ; it 's our duty to put him where he ca n't cause any more trouble . " The Justice tapped a pencil against the palm of his open hand . " Reggie , " he said , " you do n't seem to understand . Both the attempted rape and the killing were actions committed off-island . That piece of land is extraterritorial . It 's outside our jurisdiction . If you want confirmation , look up Waynfleet'sminutes of the public meeting at which we discussed the draft constitution . " " The whole drafting committee , " observed Father Brown , " agreed that all who did n't want to be citizens could move off-island . " " And Polyvanov , " resumed the J.P. , " made that choicep150as was his privilege . I understand that , last night , he surrenderedvoluntarily , thus meeting his obligations as a paroled P.W . If this were his native Russia , and he were opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But under our Constitution there is no legal basis for his detention , much less for punishment . I do n't even see how he can be forcibly deported , since the Council has not legislatedon that subject and the Constitution specifically states that there shall be no ex post facto law . " " You mean to say , " expostulated Colonel Showalter , " that we 've set up a government which is helpless to deal with enemies in our midst ? " " I mean to say that we have set up a government of impartiallaw . That law can be modified but it can not be violated , unless you want to go in for legalized lynching , as the United States did in the so-called war crimes trials . " " Judge Anderson is right , Reggie , " said Father Brown . " You were n't a member of the Constitutional Convention . I 'm sure that Walter and Gilbert and Bill all recall our decision that the Constitution should be regarded as a social contract . Nobody was to be forced to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my thinking , he and Madeleine Buchanan have been living in sin , over there . But I have to admit that we are not empowered to punishhim for that . " " Wid yo ' puhmission , gemmen , " remarked Bill Jefferson . " Ah 'd like to express the sentiments of our cullud brethren . They 's full of remorse about Paul Stoner . We knowed he wuz bad , but not so bad as what he was set fo ' to do . By contras ' , dis yere Steve Douglas ez jes ' weak . We knows he ain ' vicious like Paul wuz , and we doan think Steve should get mo'an a month or so in jail , when we gets a jail to hol ' him . As fo ' Mr. Polly , we doan see no cause to criminate him a-tall . All he done was protec ' his gal and that ain ' punishable , or shouldn ' be . " " That 's an admirable viewpoint , Bill , " said Judge Anderson , a little wearily . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is n't a question of the morality of either Polyvanov or Steve Douglas . It 's simply that all this took place outside our jurisdiction . Therefore , in these cases , we have no authorityto punish . Power is not authority , under our system . Actually , we are at this moment ourselves transgressors , by holding in duress two men whom we have no legal right whateverto detain . " " You mean , " inquired Walter Travis , " that Steve Douglas is also immune , for extraterritorial reasons ? " " In some respects his case is different . He was , by his own admission , an accomplice in the attempted rape . But for reasonsstated , neither that nor the killing of Stoner by Polyvanovin defense of Madeleine Buchanan , is punishable under the law of Gumption Island . It 's further admitted that Douglas , in partnership with Stoner , was planning to bootleg moonshine into this community . I assume the Council would soon have acted to make that illegal , but at present there is no law on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Travis , " Steve Douglas is a certified citizen , while Polyvanov is not . " " That 's the difference , " agreed Anderson . " Perhaps I certified Steve too quickly and I can certainly revoke his citizenship , for good and sufficient reason , subject to his right of appeal to you gentlemen of the Council . I may do that , but I 'd like to talk to him , in the presence of Bill Jefferson , first . I would want further to consider the common law status of a non-citizen in a community which he is physically unable to leave , except for a deserted islet . Incidentally , Father Brown , I think we must regard Madeleine as the common law wife of Polyvanov . " " It seems to me , " exploded Colonel Showalter , " we 're just plain hamstrung by this Constitution . It 's that Fifth Amendmentbusiness all over again . I 've been named Councillor in charge of security matters and , when I accept a job , I like to do it properly . This Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lay him by the heels . But you all say it would n't be constitutional . My feeling is , I ought to resign . "   " Not so fast , Reggie , " said Walter soothingly . " As chairmanof the Council , I would n't accept your resignation . And I think what Sidney is telling us is most important . The whole purpose of constitutional government is to restrain those in power . As to subversives , you can be one while holding exaltedoffice . Take the case of ... " " I do n't think we should take any case , " interrupted Gil Edminster , " other than those before us . Obviously , Judge Anderson has no option except to liberate Polyvanov and Douglas , revoking the latter 's citizenship if he thinks best . But I 've got a suggestion . Is there any reason why the Councilshould n't act to annex the off-island territory , to prevent any repetition of this moonshine business ? Then we could use it as a penal colony , or a reserve for second-class citizens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " cried Colonel Showalter enthusiastically . " I 'll raise the Stars and Stripes over there this afternoon ! " " The yacht squadron banner , I suppose you mean , " commentedAnderson dryly . " Anyway , that 's your business . Mine is to release Polyvanov . With your permission , I 'll call him in and do it now . I 'd like all of you to be present . " He walked to the door outside which Peter Clarke , a revolversomewhat ostentatiously strapped at his waist , was dozing peacefully . The sheriff leapt to attention at the touch on his shoulder . " Pete , " said the Judge , " will you bring Polyvanov here , please ? " Locked in an empty bedroom of the island hospital , Wing Commander Vladimir Polyvanov brooded resentfully . He had , he fully realized , played into the hands of the capitalist exploiters . Although they themselves treated Negroes like slaves , he would be held to strict accountability for having killed one . Probably the sentence would be death at the hands of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The hypocritical priest would offer him spiritual consolation . Well , he could spurn that anyway.  |p153Exce|pt  for Madeleine he would n't greatly care . Indeed  --  he smiled sardonically  --  this ending would be quite in the family tradition . His grandfather , a Czarist general , had been killed by the Japanese at Mukden . His father , one of the Bolshevik intelligentsia , had been liquidated as a Trotskyite at the time of the great purge . Now he would get it because he also was too resolute for any compromise . Madeleine had warned him that his idealism merely irritated these smug Americans . But what a lovely girl she was  --  what dignity and intelligence , in addition to physical charm ! Although she had renouncedeverything for him , yet her essential independence was still unconquered , as he well knew . It was strange that she would live with him and yet make fun of communism , for which he lived . Somehow , that gentle mockery of hers had worried him less than he would have thought . How had she put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long before you were a Communist . " Maybe that was true . Maybe there were things in life more fundamental than the party line . He would certainly have married Madeleine if there had been any possibility of a civil ceremony . But that was all out of the picture now . He had told the truth and nothing but the truth , as she had said he should . In consequence , he would be shot . So be it . A sharp tap on the door confirmed the conclusion . The key grated in the lock and Peter Clarke , a smile on his quizzical face , stepped in . " Hello , Polly , " he said , " feeling sorry for yourself , as usual ? They want to see you over in the courthouse . I 'm guard of honor . " Somehow Polyvanov felt no resentment for the familiarity . " Tell me , Peter , " he said earnestly . " Is Madeleine all right ? Has her uncle forgiven her ? " " Sure , " replied Peter brightly , ushering his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl for almost anything . I guess Buck will ask you over there for dinner tonight . You 'll see for yourself . " " My last supper , " said the Russian dramatically , stoppingp154for a moment on the stairs . " Peter , when you take me , arrange that I have ten minutes alone with her . Here , I give you my grandfather 's watch , presented to him by his old regimentwhen he was made general officer . It is more precious to me than anything but Madeleine . " " Go on , you goop , " said Peter , pushing him affectionately . " I wo n't even be there . I have a date with the Judge 's daughter . And if you give your heirloom to anybody , it had better be Buck Buchanan . He probably has mixed feelings about you . " " A good idea , " thought Polyvanov , throwing his shoulders back and marching proudly through the hospital office . Pullingthe jacket of his tattered uniform down he ran a pocket comb through his long blond hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verandah . Peter rapped on the door of the trophy room , swung it open , pushed his charge inside and closed it from the outside just in time to stifle his laughter . Then , lighting an untidy homemadecigarette , he shifted the chair so that his ear came close to the keyhole . " At your service , gentlemen , " said Commander Polyvanov , clicking his heels and coming to attention before the table at which the Council members and Judge Anderson were chatting . The latter rose , acknowledging the salute with a courteous bow . " Please sit down , Mr. Polyvanov , " he said , gesturing towards a cushioned wicker chair . Vladimir complied warily , leaning stiffly forward with hands on knees . Closely he studied the faces of those whom he considered his judges , seeking to ascertain the attitude of each . That of Colonel Showalter was obviously hostile . Father Brown looked unusually stern . Bill Jefferson revealed embarrassment . Gilbert Edminster and Walter Travis stared back impassively . " Three for death and two undecided , " he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening words of Judge Anderson , still standing , did not sound at all like Procurator Vyshinsky , whose **25;10140;TOOLONG of his father had seared Vladimir 's childhood memory . " We recognize that we owe you an apology , Mr. Polyvanov , " the J.P . was saying . " When you went off-island , on the clear understanding that you had the right to refuse citizenshiphere , you passed beyond the jurisdiction of this court . Whatever your actions there , whether morally excusableor not , is beside the point . Whatever trespass was committed , it was not on the laws of Gumption Island . Therefore , we have no case against you and the decision of this court is that you be dismissed . " Confusion mounted in Vladimir 's mind . English words could be tricky , especially " dismissed . " As the J.P . paused invitingly he spoke : " Excuse me , but my understanding is still imperfect . I am not certain what you mean by jurisdiction . I kill a man  --  justly I think . I am under parole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you have jurisdiction over me . Is that not it ? " " No , Mr. Polyvanov , " replied Judge Anderson , " that is not it . Jurisdiction is Latin for the saying of the law , which may not justify possession of your body . Are you familiar with the principle of habeas corpus ? " Vladimir shook his head , listening intently as the quiet voice droned on in explanation . This lawyer , he concluded , has been appointed to defend me . But that is just empty bourgeois formality , as anyone could tell from Colonel Showalter'sgrim look . " Thank you , sir , " he said at Anderson 's next pause , " but what is the opinion of the court ? " " Just what I have told you , " explained the Justice patiently ; " that you have suffered from a false arrest , for which the court apologizes . " " With your permission , Mr. Justice , " said Father Brown , " I believe Commander Polyvanov is confused by our presence here . He thinks we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel . Am I correct ? " " You are correct in that , " admitted Vladimir guardedly . Anderson laughed . " Well , then , " he said , " I shall make twoP156suggestions : First , that you , Mr. Polyvanov , read our Constitution , and read it carefully . Second , that you gentlemen of the Council , whose help today I greatly appreciate , leave us now . That should make the identity of this court quite clear . " Vladimir gazed perplexedly at the floor as the members of the Council rose and filed out . Walter Travis , who came last , patted him on the shoulder . " Cheer up , Polly , " he said . " Lots of Americans have lived with it and still do n't understand . " Laughter , and a grumbling noise from Colonel Showalter , came through the door as it closed to leave the Justice and the Communist alone . Anderson looked at his wrist . " Polly , " he said , " your brainwashing is finished . George Buchanan asked me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it by seven , if we walk fast . Will you come ? " With head bowed , the Russian officer sought to control his voice . " I can think of nothing better , " he said chokingly .   " YOU DO N'T NEED to apologize , Phil , " said Dr. Adler . " We 're public servants . And if it 's anything to do with finance , this is the place . I guess you know your Constitution  --  ' All fiscal and financial powers granted by the people shall vest in a Bank of Gumption Island . ' " " It 's a queer-looking bank , " commented Phil Baker , closingthe door and looking curiously around the former clubhousebar . Except for the absence of all bibulous equipment , the little room was much as it had been prior to the bombing . A solid counter , with the big mirror behind it now badly cracked , ran nearly the length of the inner side . In the wider space beyond , one table and four plain chairs remained in place . Otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gumption Island yachts , and a few water-color cartoons satirizing amateur sailors and incompetentgolfers , remained incongruously on the walls . " Oh , you must give us a little time , " said Adler suavely , rising to shake hands . " We have great plans . Meanwhile , take a chair . Already we can accommodate two clients simultane-ously . " " You see , Phil , " explained Kenneth Bryson , " we plan to partition off this end as our private office . Then one of us can step through on call to serve as teller behind the counter , where Perry Warren used to mix his famous Gumption Girls . The cleared space in front will be for people coming to cash checks or deposit money . We 'll move a couple of tables back there after we 've had the carpenter in , assuming we ever get him . "   " Would it be impertinent to ask what you 're doing now ? " inquired the young chemist , glancing at the litter of scribbled papers . " Glad to tell you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bank managers is to prepare the annual budget , which must go to the Council , in balance , by December first , two weeks hence . Together with the budget , we have to present the tax schedule , showing how the revenue is going to be raised . We 've got all the data we can secure from the Council and now we 're trying to work it up . " " Quite a simple job , " observed Bryson , " since we can only tax income , of which nobody has any , and since the Council 's preliminary expenditure estimates for next year exceed the entire currency supply . For the Department of Security alone , Colonel Showalter wants nearly half as much money as we originally planned to place in circulation . " " So we 've already progressed a long way , " beamed Dr. Adler . " Only a truly modern government would consider spending half of the national substance for defense . " " It sounds impossible to me , " said Baker . " How are we ever going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income which is the only source of taxation , other than estate taxes , where the same problem will apply ? " " A free economy starts itself , Phil . And the motor 's already running here . Look "  --  the senior manager took a notebook from his pocket and studied a page  --  " here 's a list of fifteen nonagricultural enterprises now systematically under way . Here 's Abe Lincoln repairing bicycles and tools ; here 's Delphine Travis spinning cotton and wool ; here 's George Garvey starting a restaurant ; here 's Admiral Evans harpooningporpoises ; here 's Hunter Randolph , boiling down blubber to make lamp oil ; here 's Polyvanov , turning out his patent lamps at the Buchanan forge . Do you see how those last three fit together : blubber , oil and lamps ? Nobody had to tell Polly to make lamps . When he came back from offisland , ten days ago , he saw the opportunity and took it . " " Even though he is a Communist , " commented Bryson.  | " But , " protested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of products has been on a barter basis . The only money involvedhas been those cardboard gumptions , plus United States currency at a fantastic rate of exchange . And the prices asked do n't make any sense at all to me . I know we 're beginning to get some odds and ends of industrial production . I do n't see how that will provide more individual income than if we 'd kept the Emergency Coinmittee , assigning work to everybody . " " Evidently , " said Bryson smiling , " you do n't appreciate the importance of this bank . It will provide the credit mechanismwithout which any economy must remain primitive . This is only the third day we 've been open for business . But already we 've made two cash loans right out of the lockbox on which Albert , with admirable conservatism , is resting his foot at this minute . " " Can you tell me what the loans are for ? It 's not just idle curiosity on my part . " Bryson turned to his co-manager . " What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm for it , so long as we do n't give away trade secrets , like the amount or the rate of interest . " " I say we should take every opportunity to spread understandingof what we 're doing . We 've made a fairly substantialloan to George Buchanan , who must employ help to extract , transport , and smelt the iron ore he 's working . And we made a small loan to Daisy Crashaw , who 's opening a dress shop and wants to employ Sadie Banks as a seamstress . " " What sort of security did they offer ? " " As security , Phil , the bank has taken a mortgage on Buchanan 's house . And from Daisy , we have a diamond ring as collateral . The diamond is worthless here , except maybe to cut glass . But we can always use eighteen-carat gold . Incidentally , we got Murion to draw up Buchanan 's mortgage in proper legal form and paid him a gold gumption for the service . He was n't wholly satisfied with the fee . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no  --  with a paper gumption redeemable in gold , if heP160gets enough of them . What Murion actually did with the money was to go to the corporation store this morning and buy a dozen cans of soup at our tentatively established price . By order of the Council , Greg Waynfleet is selling off what 's left of the canned goods  --  everything that has n't been given to the hospital . Murion got a little change back , and I gather he was pleased to find that the gumption has high purchasingpower . " " And since , by constitutional provision , the bank owns the store , " remarked Bryson , " roost of Marion 's fee will be back in our strongbox by the end of the week . " " I see , " said Phil Baker reflectively . " Possibly you will get this financial confusion straight . Well , gentlemen , I do n't want to waste your precious time . I might as well admit that I came in to see if I can get a loan myself . " " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands together . " Of course you wo n't mind telling us about your project ? " " My project , " replied the chemist deliberately , " is to manufacture paper . That 's an essential commodity of which we 're already terribly short . " " We certainly are short on paper , " agreed Bryson . " This on the table here  --  know what it is ?  - -  the blank back pages of my monthly bank letter , taken out of my files at the house . Paper of every kind will soon be as scarce as hen 's teeth . I do n't want to seem vulgar but , at our place , all the old newspapersare gone now and , for a basic function , leaves are extremelyunsatisfactory . " Albert Adler scratched his nose reflectively . " If you can really make paper , Phil , " he said , " you 'll deserve a statue here . Is n't it a rather complicated process ? " " Not fundamentally . You need certain chemicals , of course . But I found some sulphur off-island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble about soda . Then you need soft pine , of which there 's plenty . I made a mold and , for pressing , I usep161an old hand wringer we had in the laundry . It 's slow , but ade-quate . " " Have you got any samples of your product ? " " In my pocket . This white piece takes ink perfectly  --  see ? It would serve for notepaper or typewriting of any kind . The coating comes from the same kaolin that I ) r . Washburn is using for dental fillings . This coarse , dirty-looking piece is n't treated and is too porous to take writing ink . But it 's wholly adequate for newsprint , or wrapping , or for that sanitary purpose that worries Ken Bryson . " " That better paper , Albert , " said Bryson , " would pretty well solve our checkbook problem . Could it be watermarked ? " " Easily ; and if you want to use it for bank notes , I could work in a pattern of Delphine 's cotton thread , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a point , " admitted Dr. Adler . " Could you producepaper like these samples in reasonable quantity ? " " Within limits and with some help . I could certainly turn out as much newsprint as Tom Phillips says he needs for that weekly bulletin he wants to publish . Tom figures on a circulationof a hundred copies  --  just one sheet printed on both sides ; same size as this sample , twelve by fifteen inches . That would mean a strip 125 feet long , one foot wide . From the pulp , I could roll that in a couple of hours . You might also like to see this sample envelope . The stickum is n't too good . " " How much help do you figure you would need , " asked Bryson , " and what wages would you expect to pay ? " " Well , I assume I can buy pine wood , cut to the desired length for treatment and delivered to my garage , where I 've already set up my pulping vat . Any unskilled man can pulp the fibre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts The Islander , as he calls it  --  I ' 11 need that man full time . Then I must also have a little expert mechanical assistance , to put heavier rollers and gears on my wringer . Abe Lincoln could do that job , I know . As for wages , I do n't have the ghost of an idea , any more than what I would have to pay for pine wood by the cord . Suppose you answer that one . "  | " We think it essential , " replied Dr. Adler , " to get started on a hard-money basis . Government can always depreciate the currency , to get around its immediate financial difficulties . But to restore purchasing power after depreciation is mighty painful . So , at the outset , anyway , we 're limiting the supply of money severely . That means low prices and low wages . " " I understood the gumption was to be worth twenty cents , " said Phil ; " five to the gold dollar . But I ca n't reconcile that with Murion getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " We have a gold reserve of five hundred dollars , " explainedDr . Adler . " And at first we proposed a total note issue of 2500 gumptions , meaning , as you say , that each unit would have an exchange value of twenty cents gold . But , to get a dynamic economy , money must circulate freely , and that means the note issue must be adequate as well as limited . Now that the bank is under way , we 've raised the total to 5000 gumptions , meaning ten to the gold dollar . " " If that were the entire currency supply , " interposed Bryson , " it would mean a per capita average of approximatelythirty gumptions for every man , woman , and child on this island . Not very much ! " " I should say not , " commented Phil . " If the gumption is only worth a dime , then everyone on the island is going to be terribly poor . " " It 's obvious that you 're an excellent chemist , Phil , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you do n't understand money . It 's a blind spot for many intelligent people . The popular illusion is that possession of money makes people rich . That 's only true if money has value . What puts value into money is the production of goods , which are most conveniently exchanged by the use of money . But , as Ken said , to produce and exchange goods on any but a primitivebasis you must have credit , and that 's why you 're here . You have the know-how and , if we can help you turn it into desirable production , the whole island will be wealthier , re/gardless of the nominal value of the gumption in American cents . " " I understand , " said Phil , " that if credit does n't increase production , or stimulates undesirable production , it may operateto undermine the value of money . " " That 's why bankers are important , " affirmed Bryson . " If Albert and I extend credit judiciously , it will increase desirableproduction on the island and thereby automatically increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as production advances , we can increase the amount of money without lowering the purchasing power of the unit . On the other hand , if we give credit without stimulating useful production , the value of the gumption will tend to decrease and the more gumptions we print , the less each one will be worth . That 's inflation . " " And inflation , " observed Dr. Adler , " makes it silly to talk of gold dollars and paper dollars as though they were the same thing . The last time I was in Paris , I paid over four thousand paper francs for a 0-franc gold piece . There would have been a big dollar premium for American gold coins also , if they had n't been taken out of circulation . " " Maybe I 'm not altogether the financial ignoramus you assume , " retorted Phil . " I see that the gumption can have an arbitrary exchange value of ten cents gold but a purchasing power far greater than the Roosevelt dime in my pocket . But to see that does n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor . And I 've got to know that before I can fix a price for the paper I 'm ready to make . " " The free market will fix that price for you , " retorted Adler . " Here 's your illustration : If Bryson agrees , this bank will make you an offer to manufacture paper for bank notes . We ought to have something that looks better and wears better than these cardboard makeshifts . But unless you accept our price , we 'll make do with what we 've got and then you 'll peddle your product elsewhere . I do n't want to seem rude , Phil . I do want to emphasize that it is n't the seller who fixesP164the price in a competitive market . Price is fixed by those who purchase , all of them unconsciously acting together to bid it up or down . " " That goes for wages , also , " said Bryson . " In paying wages , you become the purchaser of services that Abe Lincoln or somebody else offers to sell you . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and Martha will get your papermakingproject under way on your own . Then Abe Lincoln will offer his time to somebody else . Competition for goods and services determines the price of both . " " Are you telling me , Albert , " inquired the chemist , " that I wo n't myself decide whether I 'll make bank notes or toilet paper ? " " That 's exactly what I 'm telling you . Clearly , you have the ability to make either . But , at this stage , you must put one or the other first and you yourself ca n't decide which . Therefore somebody else will , in effect , decide for you . " " Is it going to be you ? " " It is , " said Bryson . " In my opinion , the community welfaredemands good-looking money rather than toilet paper . Of course , you could probably find time to turn out a few rolls of the latter for Albert and me , in return for the banknotecontract . " " I trust you do n't mean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't get this bank established independent of governmentcontrol in order to do business like that . But you 've given a good illustration of the corrupt way a dictatorship always works . " " I suppose the really democratic form of decision , " observedPhil , " would be a popular plebiscite . Those who want bank notes , extend a hand ; those who want toilet paper , raise a leg . " " I 'm not amused , " said Adler . " The method would be as putrid as the joke . In any such plebiscite , a majority would confusedly reason that if they voted for money they 'd get money , for themselves . We 'd have demagogues exploiting the general financial ignorance , as they always do . I hope youp165both see that you 've separately exposed the flaws in both dictatorshipand democracy . The beauty of the free market is that it combines the virtues of both , without subservience to their defects . " " You might enlarge on that , " suggested Phil . " In a free market , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the possible alternatives , shall he produced . That is certainly democratic . At the same time , if the government does n't interfere , these consumers , by shopping around collectively , force producers to be efficient . That is certainly dictatorial . But both the democratic choice and the dictatorial direction are made impersonally . What more do you ask ? " " Well , " retorted Phil Baker . " I still ask what will be a fair day 's wage for my vat man ? " Dr. Adler , looking out of the window , smiled and waved his hand . " By coincidence , " he said , " here 's the expert on that subject . We asked Professor Stevens to serve as our economic adviser , and he agreed to stop by this morning to go over some disputed points in the budget . Come in , Thad  --  and tell Phil Baker what we agreed would be a just wage for a full day 's work on Gumption Island . " The tall young economist shook hands smilingly and draped his battered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know why I wore this thing today , " he said . " It seems hotter and more humid than ever , even though they tell me this is the seventeenth of November . " " It promises to be the eighteenth , " said Phil , " before I know what wages I ought to offer . " " There 's no ought ' about it , " retorted Professor Stevens sharply . " It 's simply a matter of what the market will stand . My recommendation is a gumption a day for skilled labor , a little better than half that for unskilled . Of course that 's just a starter , to get things moving . Competition will soon modify it , up or down . On the one hand , there are no unions to forceP166wages up . On the other , the demand for productive labor is far in excess of the supply and likely to become more so . " " Half a gumption a day ! " ejaculated Phil Baker . " Why , that 's only the equivalent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price level just before the bombing . " " Mr. Baker finds it very difficult to escape from his inheritedpattern of financial thinking , " commented Adler dryly . " He ca n't see that money has absolutely no meaning except as a reflection of productivity . His trouble , I think , roots in the fact that our gold reserve is in American dollars . Therefore , he relates the value of a gumption to the value that a gold dollar had in his childhood . If the reserve were in gold marbles , it might clarify matters . " " That 's a thought , " mused Bryson . " Have Buchanan melt the coin down into one hundred gold marbles . Then you could redeem fifty paper gumptions for each one of them . " " Well , you ca n't blame Phil for not understanding money , " said Stevens , " unless you also blame me for not understanding isotopes . Did you tell him about our little object lesson over at the community store ? Those beans should help to make it clear . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a commercial loan , " he said with some irritation . " What I 've been getting is a tiresome lecture on banking and currency . Do you have to string those beans out very long ? " " No , " laughed Stevens . " It 's a simple story , but illustrative . As you know , the Emergency Committee at first urged everyone to plant beans  --  highly nutritious and easy to raise . And now we have a perfect glut of them . There was a guaranteedprice to the bean raiser of five cents a pound and a fixed retail price at the communal store of six cents . The Directorate figured it would make a little money on this Brannan Plan . " " What 's actually happened , " said Bryson , " is that our Commodity Credit Corporation has gone bust  --  on beans instead of butter . " " Waynfleet , " confirmed Stevens , " has paid out every centp167of the cash allotted to him . He has n't sold a bean for a fortnight . And he has two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for stock and giving the hospital as many as Mrs. Lawson would accept . Now , under the Council law establishing the new currency , a penny has become a tenth of a gumption , but should be worth more than any penny since the days of Queen Elizabeth . " " The free enterprise Lizzie , " interrupted Bryson . " So we told Greg , " continued the economist , " to offer his beans at five pounds for a penny . That 's at the rate of fifty pounds for a gumption . At that price those beans will move . Moreover , fewer will be planted . " " And you 'll get a far better understanding of our money , " said Dr. Adler , " if you 'll regard the gumption as being worth fifty pounds of beans rather than ten cents gold . " Phil produced his purse , extracted a dime and smacked it on the table . " I understand , " he said , " that this is now real money . It 's no longer the price of a doughnut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A penny will buy me five pounds of beans . But a penny is the smallest currency unit . Suppose I want to buy just one pound of beans ? How do I get it ? " Smilingly the senior bank manager opened the table drawer , extracted a beer bottle cap stamped AI ) LEB. in red letters , and placed it beside the dime . " Good for everythingexcept tossing , " he said . " Ten adlers to the penny , by virtue of the new currency law . You can swap your dime for a hundred of these , then go over to the store and buy half a pound of beans for one bottle cap . That will help to show you that money is only a token and has no inherent value . " Phil Baker examined the bottle cap curiously . " Obviously you have these in quantity , " he commented . " I 'll take a dime 's worth . But where on earth  --  or on this island anyway  --  did you get them ? " " We have Edgar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened that Labor Day weekend he had a load of bottle caps going from Baltimore to his Annapolis brewery . Edgar arranged to have the driver come by the island toP168deliver a hand roller he 'd bought for his grass terrace . Night of the explosion , the driver parked here and went off-island to visit relatives . So , when the smash came , here was the truck stranded with ten thousand caps for Adler beer , the roller , and some other junk . Edgar was kidding Albert a while back about his name being the same as the beer . The upshot was we got him to contribute the caps for coinage  --  ten kegs , a thousand to a keg . " " We have them stored in our vault in the club cellar , " added Dr. Adler . " Where the liquor stores were kept . However , here 's your hundred , in this ice-cream carton . Now that you 've taken them , I 'll admit that ten for a penny is a perfectlyarbitrary ratio . But in everything to do with money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They look cheap , so we made them cheap . Pretty soon , I guess , everybody will be figuring small prices in adlers . It 's going to be embarrass-ing . " " Well , you ca n't change your name , except by Act of Council , " commented Stevens . " That roller you mentioned , " remarked Phil Baker inconsequentially . " It could be just what I need to press my wood pulp . I looked at the big one Caselli took from the tennis courts . That 's too unwieldy . " " I 'm sure you could borrow or rent it from Edgar Johnson , " said the senior manager . " Now , unless you want to count your adlers , have you decided how much of a loan you want , and for how long ? " " How about fifty gumptions , for three months ? By then I ought to be well under way . " " Fifty gumptions ! " ejaculated Bryson . " Do you realize that 's one per cent of our whole monetary issue ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " because we 're temporarily reserving 2000 gumptions to exchange for United States coins at the rate of ten cents a gumption . Caselli 's questionnaire showed a little less than 200 dollarsp169in coin on the island , aside from what was in the club and corporation tills . That belongs to the bank now . Of course , some people may have understated the coin they really have . " " I must say you 've got me confused , " admitted Phil . " You say the note issue is only 5000 gumptions . But these bottle caps add up to another 100 gumptions , plus 2000 or more in coin in people 's pockets , plus maybe as much more in the bank 's possession , plus all the paper dollars that must be lying around . I take it a single ten-spot is worth a hundred gumptions . Yet you boggle about my suggesting what amounts to a five-dollar loan ! " " You see , " said Dr. Adler to Bryson and Stevens , " he just ca n't realize that from now on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little as our collective productivity puts into it . " " As for the United States dollars , " observed Bryson , " they have n't been legal tender on Gumption Island since midnight . That 's in the currency law . American coins are acceptable , as you know , but not the paper money . That 's worth-less . " Phil Baker whistled . " Then I 'd better get out and spend my bills while I can on whatever they 'll buy . " " We trust you 'll do no such thing , " reproved the senior manager severely . " Bryson here has a lot of paper dollars on hand  --  probably more than anybody else . But he 's consented to take the rap , and we hope everyone will do the same . Anyway , the news is out . A notice has been on the bulletin board since midnight . The United States dollar is like Confederate money now . It was getting that way pretty fast , even before the bombing . " " I guess the arrangement is reasonable , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the bill holders , but the distribution of the coin is probably much more even . As Gil Edminster said , the more level the economic basis from which we make our fresh start , the better for the com-munity . " " I 've come to feel that way myself , " admitted Brysonp170wryly . " But because we 're starting even does n't mean we 're all going to stay that way . I 'll bet , for instance , that you 'll do well with this paper business . Obviously , we 're soon going to want paper much more than we want beans , which everyonecan grow for himself . Listen , I 'll go along with my co-manager here and place an order with you now for watermarked , durable , pliable bank notes to replace this cardboardstuff  --  if you can manage to get it engraved . " The chemist rubbed his bearded chin thoughtfully . " It would be easy enough to make the impressions  --  in any quantity  --  ifwe had the plates , " he said . " You 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bill . Be no trouble to color each denomination differently , but you 'd still have to recut the numerals . " " We have a copper card tray that was the matrix for our wedding announcement , " suggested Bryson . " Elise and I will donate that to the cause . You can wash out the present engravingwith acid and find someone to etch in a design . Then I 'll warrant you 'll find another plate of the same sort for the reverse . It 's the commonest sort of family souvenir . " " I 'm with Bryson 100 per cent , " said Dr. Adler . " We 're taking great pains to see that our money here will have value . So the bank notes ought to look valuable . I 'll carry Ken 's suggestion a step further . You get these plates and find someone to do the etching , of course to our approval , and we 'll make you a 25 gumption loan for three months , interest free , on your own note of hand . Then we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for making the special paper and engraving the bills . That 'll start you off well  --  a contractwith the Bank of Gumption Island . And before you come back , get Phillips to print a sample check on that good quality paper . Here , I 'll give you the wording . " " Of course , " added Bryson , " as a matter of public policy the currency plates would have to be etched and kept here . Also , the printing of the money must be under our supervision . Nothing personal , but we ca n't take any risk of unauthorizedimpressions. "  |p171Phil  Baker tapped the table thoughtfully with his forefinger . " It 's a good idea , " he assented . " Jill Clendenning does lovely lettering . I believe she could do the engraving . If so , and if we find this second copper plate , I 'll go along . When do I get the loan ? " " Right now , " said Dr. Adler , stooping to the box at his feet . " Just sign this receipt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got it interest free . We would n't keep the gumption hard if we gave much credit on that basis . " " You left one point made by Phil dangling in air , " observedProfessor Stevens , while Adler counted out the crudelookingcardboard notes . " He spotted the fact that the total currency supply will be quite a bit more than the note issue  --  probably about 10,000 gumptions all told . That 's a per capita circulation of approximately 60 gumptions , half in specie and half in notes . " " The ratio is high , " agreed the senior manager , " but there 's some coin being hoarded and the way to get it out is to make the paper money both scarce and desirable . With checking accounts , we 'll soon get increased velocity of spending . That alone will have the effect of a proportionate increaseof currency . The essential point is to keep the currency supply contracted until expansion is forced by commercial transactions . Money does n't create production . Production creates money . That 's what everyone on Gumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realize it better than when I came in , " said Baker , pocketing his fountain pen . " How do you like my homemade ink ? You ca n't possibly erase it . I 'll use it in making these bank notes , if Jill will do the engraving . She was corning over to lunch with Martha , so I 'll probably find her at the house now . " " I hope Martha is bearing up pretty well , " said Bryson , rising and holding out his hand . " Elise asked me to tell you that she wants to bring her sewing down for a good visit soon . We do feel deeply for you both . "  |p172With  a gentle knock , the door opened slowly to admit the grizzled head of old George Garvey , the former chef . " Hello , George , " said Phil , as he picked up his cardboard money . " Take my seat  --  no charge for that . But here 's a warning  --  if you 're after cash , be prepared for a liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Dr. Adler , " to hear the word liberal used correctly . "  | " OUTGHTER RES ' a mite higher , doan you think , Mr. Garvey ? " Tentatively , Steve Douglas moved the big holly wreath a few inches up and down on the inside of the freshly painted dining-room door . The old chef , holding a candle aloft for better illumination , watched judicially , then pointed with his free hand . " Right there , Steve , " he said firmly . " Tack her in there . Folks is going to be sitting at the tables when they see these Christmas greens . So we doan want too much elevation . Now feed dat fire up mo ' cheerful .

Den , as people ketch on to his service , he fix his own charges . He tol ' me lie 's goin ' good , but I kaint write nor read no letters , so Ah don ' rightly unnerstan ' how come . " " It ai n't difficult , Steve . Beyond readin ' knowledge , Perry jes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroun ' the island and he had that . He need the guts to go roun ' regular , rain or shine , an ' he sho ' has that . Den he need to hab an idea clear in his mine , an ' he got dat . He ' splain it all to de Council , and Mr. Travis he tells it to Mr. Phillips . Den Mr. Phillips he talks to Perry and writes a piece fo ' de very first number of his paper , three weeks ago . Ah got it here . I'se what dey calls a charter subscriber . " Putting on his spectacles , the old Negro took a ragged sheet of badly printed paper from a shelf in the corner and read slowly : POSTAL SERVICEWarren Scheme ObtainsCouncil ApprobationWarren 's Express , making daily collections and delivery of mail , begins operations tomorrow , having received unanimous approval from the Council at its regular meeting Wednesday . For the first week , the service will be free and the proprietor will receive a per diem subsidy of ten adlers from the Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 6 of the Constitution ( the Welfare Clause ) . Thereafter service will be by individual contract , with payment either onp175the basis of pieces handled , or by inclusive weekly rate . Mr. Warren announces that he will cover the whole island every week-day morning , making collections from the old newspaper tubes between 7 and 9 A.M. and pledging delivery by noon . The service will extend to any letter , card , message , or parcel small enough to be contained in the tube ; larger packages by special arrangement . The names of consignee and sender must be clearly written . Recorder Waynfleet has some extra tubes available . All who desire home delivery of The Islander , on the morning of publication , may have this at no increase in cost , as a part of the Warren service . " So yo ' see , Steve , " concluded George Garvey , " dey ai n't nothin ' here to hold a colored feller back , if he 's smart as Perry Warren . I subscribes to his Express and dis mawnin ' , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Venable , sayin ' he and Mr. Caselli and Mr. Wilson is comin ' fo ' dinner dis berry ebenin ' . And here dey is now , while you'se gapin ' . Git into yo ' white coat quick ! " Voices in the passageway heralded the approaching guests . The door swung open to Doggy Venable 's vigorous push . Roy Wilson and Tony Caselli followed the former lumber rnerchant into the cosy room , partitioned off in one end of what had been the long dining-hall of the club . Appreciatively , their eyes took in the crackling wood fire in the stove , the table set for three , the Christmas decorations , and the improvisedbar , behind which big Steve Douglas stood smiling cheerfully , if somewhat breathless . " Hello , Steve , " said Venable ; " hello , George . You got my card ? " " Yas , suh . It come by the mawnin ' mail , plenty o ' time for me to get a real good dinner fixed for you three gemmen . Ai n't no other reservations this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve 's all set fo ' to shake the cocktails , good as you can make ' em when dey ain ' no ice . " " Well , we do n't expect ice at Garvey 's Restaurant yet , "  |p176continued  Venable . " But from what we 've heard , we do expect a good dinner . You 're the talk of the island , George . You must be coining money . What 's cooking tonight ? " " Fus ' of all , sub , I 've got some nice oysters that Steve here tonged up in the Cove jes ' this afternoon . We has to pick them fresh , of co'se . Den I got a fine snapper soup . Den some duck Steve done trap after yo ' card come . Fo ' vegetables , they 's French fries , corn on de cob , and lima beans . Den a salad and raspberry tart to top off . Wisht I could give you coffee , but ai n't none of that lef ' no mo ' . Dis acorn brew ai n't so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I does . " " Sounds good to me , George , " said Caselli . " We can do with that meal , after the argument we 've just had with Dr. Adler and Bryson . What 's so funny , Roy ? " " It 's that duck we 're going to have , " laughed Wilson . " Makes me think of the God-awful row , just before the bomb , about whether you should or should n't shoot ducks from blinds off Gumption Island . We 'd all be happy if we had the cartridges to shoot them now . " " Well , a lot of things look different from what they did six months ago , " observed Caselli . " What are you going to stick us for that swell dinner , George ? We 're poor men , now , by your standards . And of course we 're dutching it . " " No , no , Tony , " protested Venable . " This is my party . I want to celebrate the launching of the Three-Ply Lumber and Building Corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , George , if you do n't mind my asking , I would like to know what I 'm in for . Thank you , Steve . It 's a goodlookingdrink . And tastes good too ! " " Fo ' a dinner like de one tonight , including two cocktails , " said the old chef with dignity , " I has to charge 75 adlers . An ' I can assure you dey 's mighty little in dat fo ' me . I'se gettin ' more business than I figured , but the costs is awful . I has to pay rent to de Bank fo ' dis room , use ob de kitchen and all de table stuff . I has to pay Steve Douglas fo ' his help , over and above what I pays him fo ' de vegetables he grows . I pays Mr.p177Johnson fo ' de liquor he brews off-island , and Mr. Phillips fo ' my ad in de newspaper . An ' out o ' what 's left , I got to pay taxes . Dat Gregory Waynfleet  --  calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scrupulous books an ' pay ten per cent of all mah profit . Mr. Venable , that 's taxing too hard ! " " Oh , come , George , you 're just learning the penalties of success . Everybody pays the same percentage . If you do n't like it , kick to your councilman  --  Mr. Edminster , is n't it ? Anyhow , I do n't think your charges are too high ; not the way you cook . But I 'll have to ask you to accept a quarter from me . I could write you a check , on the brand-new account of Three-Ply . Only I would n't want its first expenditure to be for entertainment . " " A quarter is 250 adlers , suh . Dat 's mo ' than ample . Steve , po ' the gentlemen a second round . And now , if you 'll excuse me , I 'll go oversee de ducks . Steve 'll serve you jes ' as soon as you all is ready . " " Do you mind if we start right away ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I promised Lucia I 'd be at the church by nine , to bring her home . " In the radiance of a dozen candles , the interior of St. Stephen's-By-The-Sea was festive . Fresh evergreens and late blooming chrysanthemums decorated the simple altar , where the newly burnished silver vessels caught and reflected the rays of mellow light . A dozen children , white and black , were ranged facing each other in two lines on either side of the organ at which Professor Cauldwell sat . To Mary Anderson , the harmony of the hymn just ended had been beautiful . Not so to Percival Cauldwell 's more finely attuned judgment . " You 'll have to do that last carol once more , " he said plaintively . " And , Fenny Jones , that 's your fault . You do n't have the words right . It 's not In Excelsior Gloria . ' It 's In Excelsis '  --  Ex-cell-cease . You put in an extra syllable and that throws everybody out . It 's strange , because you 've got a beautiful ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephants ' , " observed Charley Washburn grimly . " Now stop that , Charley , right away , " interposed Mary . " When you were chosen for the choir , you promised to stop baiting Fenny . You promised . Remember that ! " " Well , it 's a stupid hymn anyway . Not near as good as Stifle Nacht . Mr. Cauldwell talks about pronouncing that Latin word right , but with this hymn you ca n't even pronounceEnglish properly . You 've got to rhyme face ' with solace . ' How you goin ' do that ? " " Going to do that , " corrected Professor Cauldwell . " It 's really no issue , Charley , because we 're not singing the final verse . Are you all ready now ? Remember , Fenny  --  Ex-cellcease ! Okeh  --  ' Angels sang . . " Again the pure young voices rang out , triumphing over the damp that crept into every corner of the church , over the menace of the encroaching night , over all the anxieties of these involuntary colonists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outlines of the candle flames into a soft golden aura . " I wish we could have more music on the island , " she pleaded , as the Amen died away . " Would n't it be possible for you to give us a concert once in a while , Mr. Cauldwell ? Except for you , music appreciation here would be dying out altogether . We ca n't do anything much in the school . " Percival Cauldwell passed delicate fingers through his thick brush of graying hair . " Mary , " he said , " I 'm getting a little more hope in that respect . At first , it seemed that I was utterly useless here . The best I could do , with my hands , under the Directorate , was carpentry work . They did leave Inc free from digging , but there was n't any way to connect music with food . " " If music be the food of love , play on , ' " quoted Mary softly . " It 's more than that : the food of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also for many who scarcely know one note from another . I 'm encouraged now because two or threep179people have asked me about giving their children lessons . And Mrs. Bryson invites me to use their piano whenever I want . It 's a Steinway  --  easily the best on the island . I was playing there this afternoon ; the Appassionata . I 'd like to attempt some sonatas for the community , if people would come . But would they ? " " Of course they would ! More than the room will hold . Oh , Mr. Cauldwell , that 's wonderful . I 'll talk to Father Brown about it tomorrow . " " My father wants me to take music lessons , " observed Estelle Jefferson . " And take them you certainly should , " replied Cauldwell with enthusiasm . " That little girl , Mary , has the vocal promiseof your famous namesake . She 's one of those who make this choir practice a real pleasure , even if I do have to pedal the organ . " " He 's talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caselli aside to Richard Norton . " You know , they did n't use to let her sing in Constitution Hall , just like they did n't use to let Kathleen and I come to the club . " " Kathleen and me , you dumb cluck , " corrected Charley Washburn loudly . " Shut up , you fresh bastard , " shouted Fenny Jones . " Dis ai n't school here and you kaint sing no better than a screech owl nohow . " Fire consumed the tears in Mary 's eyes . " Fenny , " she reprovedindignantly . " You 're outrageous . Apologize right away , to Charley and to Professor Cauldwell . He 'd be more than justified in dropping you from the choir . " Appalled by the threat , Fenny offered his regrets . " But Ah doan know that a fresh bastard is any wuss than a dumb cluck , " he added in a truculent mumble . " Well , it 's nine o'clock and time we broke up anyway , " concluded the music teacher . " Do n't forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow evening provided it 's not raining  --  for our Carol Singing Round . "  | " Kaint we sing if it rains ? " inquired Estelle Jefferson . " Thrushes do . " " Thrushes do n't catch cold , " replied Mary severely . " You 're singing here Christmas morning , anyway , and then again the day after for the St. Stephen 's Day service . Now you all know who 's going home with who , do n't you ? " " With whom , " chortled Richard Norton . " And my father 's coming for me . I 'm going home with him . " " Mine 's coming for me , too , " cried Lucia  --  " and here he is ! Hello , Pops . " " Hello , darling , "  --  " Hello , little people , " responded Caselli and Norton from the door . " Put your hymn books away neatly , " commanded Mary . " Why , Peter ! It 's nice to see you too . Maybe you 'll stay to help me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got something better in mind . " " I 've begun to think there could n't be anything better than a wedding in mind , " said Peter Clarke enigmatically . " It 's all right if it 's only in mind , " smiled Professor Cauldwell , struggling into his raincoat . " Now remember , Fenny , you 're in charge of the Houseboat Cove group ; and Charley , you 're responsible for the Baysiders . " " All the Dinahshores is on the Bayside , " taunted Fenny gleefully , amid the general exodus . An hour later , when a cool north wind had risen to dissipatethe earlier fog and damp , Peter and Mary emerged from St. Stephen 's and started , arm in arm , up Bayswater Drive . Above , the myriad stars shone brightly , though pockets of mist lingered in the hollows . To avoid stumbles , the couple kept close to the edge of the former golf course , now roughly fenced as pasture . The cattle had been herded off for the night , but bulky shadows , moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutton . Supervision was demonstrated by a volley of warning barks from John Stokes ' big collie.  | " Shep wo n't hurt you , darling , " said Peter , as the girl pressed closer to his side . " He knows you 're not a ptero-dactyl . " Mary laughed softly . " I 'm not worrying about him , " she replied . " I was just thinking how wonderful it all is . I 've always loved the little church , but from now on it 's going to be even more sacred to me . " " Well , I never heard before of anybody proposing in a church , but you ca n't say it 's inappropriate . " " I think it was just as discriminating as everything else you do . But , Peter , you know I 'd have said the same thing whatever the setting . I was ready to say yes weeks ago . " " I was certainly ready to give you the opportunity . Only I did n't see that I had anything to offer . A policeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I guess that applies to the policeman 's wife , do n't you ? " " Oh , but I do n't think of you as a policeman , Peter . " " That 's what I am , though . Sheriff , if you want to use the official title  --  at a salary of exactly five gumptions for a seven-day week . That 's fifty cents , United States money . Mary , how do you think you 're going to run a home and maybe raise a family on fifty cents a week ? " " Peter , you know perfectly well that a gumption is worth infinitely more than a dime . Why , even one of those adler bottletops has value ! This morning , for the hospital , I bought five pounds of new potatoes from Robert and Sarah for ten adlers . Think of getting half a pound of potatoes for a beer-bottle cap ! Of course we can live on five gumptions a week , even if I have to give up my work for a time . That would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely how it would happen , " replied Peter , stopping to kiss her . Their shadowy forms merged closely until the big collie , breaking through the fence with waving brush , demanded and received his own caress . " Not this night though , Peter , " whispered Mary breathlessly . " You said you did n't think we should get married until February . That 's more than a month away , you know . WhatP182day in February ? Oh , Peter , look at that beautiful bright star . It must be Venus , do n't you think ? " " One question at a time , sweetheart . Get down , Shep ! As to the date , I said February because by then I thought I might be something better than a cop . As to the star , it ca n't be Venus because she 's right here in my arms . Say , what 's biting the dog ? " With a sharp ecstatic bark , Shep had bounded down the road , to be welcomed in the darkness behind them by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " is that you , Peter ? You 're out late . If I 'd known you were coming by here I 'd have asked you to look at the sheep for me . They feed poorly in the heat , so I leave them out nights . But I 'm never sure Shep will stay on the job . He was n't brought up to work . " Somewhat embarrassed , Mary slipped from her fiance 's encircling arm . " You probably know better than Peter , Mr. Stokes , " she said . " What star is that big round one , right over the old eighteenth green ? " " Funny you ask that , Miss Anderson , " replied John . " It 's just what I 've been wondering , walking over here from the Cove . My opinion , it ai n't no star at all . It 's just too big and round . I think it 's the moon , starting to come back again . " " The moon ! " expostulated Peter , gazing in the direction indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Explosion Night . All stars look round through a telescope . They do n't have five points just because they make ' em that way on flags . " Mary moved closer to her lover . " It 's Christmas Eve , almost , " she said reverently . " Might it not be the Star of Bethlehem ? " " That 's a pretty thought , darling . But as a question , you can hardly answer it seriously . John , you may think it 's lunacy , but let me present the future Mrs. Peter Clarke ! " " I do n't think it 's lunacy at all , " replied the foreman seriously . " I think it 's swell . Matter of fact , Jenny told me just tonight she thought you was hooked . She 'll be as pleased as I am . I still think that 's the moon , though . If it wentp183away it could come back , could n't it ? More'n that : do n't it have to come back , sometime between where we are and where we was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter . " Well , you 've got an argument there , John . How 's Jenny ? " " And when do you expect that baby ? " inquired Mary . " Another coupla months . Near the end of February , so Dr. Griffin says . Jenny 's a little sorry for herself . She misses television terrible . But she 's pretty busy keeping my books . Price of meat is so low now I can scarcely pay my interest to the bank . I thought when George Garvey opened his restaurantit would help . But that old nigger only offers one measly gumption for a fresh-killed lamb , cleaned and dressed . And I 'm losing nigh to half of them , ' count of this hot climate . Wool pays better . Jenny can work at carding that . " " All you farmers , " reflected Peter , " seem to want price supports . " " You ai n't kidding ! They worked pretty good in the old days , did n't they ? Well folks , I 'd better get back home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corning off soon ? " " I hope soon enough for you and Jenny both to come , " said Peter . " Would it help if we order mutton for the weddingbreakfast , like the Bordens of Fall River ? " " I never was in Fall River , " replied John . " But mutton would be fine . I get tallow out of that to make soap and candles . If you want lamb , it 's just a favor for you which , of course , I 'm happy to do . Go on , Shep , get back on the job . Good night , Miss Anderson ; good night , Peter . That 's sure swell about you two ! " Lights were burning late in the three battered buildings that now , as earlier , focused the social life of the island . Upstairsin Government House , formerly the corporation office , Gregory Waynfleet struggled with tax sheets for the coming year . Across the road , in the metamorphosed clubhouse bar , Albert Adler and Ken Bryson wearily checked their increas/ingly complicated books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a stub of flickering candle and even more stubby pencil , worked over his Christmas menu . The stronger , steadier radiance of an oil lamp shone out from the entrance to the adjacent hospital , in what had been the club cottage . " Looks like Times Square , " remarked Peter as the couple , reluctant to part , halted again before turning from BayswaterDrive down the short roadway to the hospital . " Do you know , Peter , " said Mary thoughtfully , " I really like the island now even better than I did . Life seems to have a meaning it lacked when this was just a pleasure place . And still it 's small enough so you can see how one thing fits into another . Take John Stokes . Of course , I knew him when he was in charge of maintenance . But he seems much more real , somehow , now that he 's bought most of the livestock and turned butcher . Tell me , did he do a good job , skinning your minks ? " " Daisy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheap . Do n't forget , Mary , that mink stole Mrs. Bryson has ordered from Daisy is a part of your simple little jigsaw puzzle here . And not all the pieces are fitting together as smoothly as you suggest . I 'm afraid John 's business is one of the misfits . " " Why do you say that , Peter ? I 'm sure he works hard enough . Look at the way he was out checking up on his sheep tonight . Do n't you think his wife helps adequately ? Wives are important , are n't they ? Even when they ca n't afford mink coats ? " " Of course they are , sweetheart . I 'm sure Jenny tries , but she 's lost without neon lights . However , John must have had Jenny taped years ago . His worry is that he 's plunged too deep . He does n't own that livestock . The bank does . Bill Jefferson was smart . Bill bought half a dozen sheep and he can swing that . But because John knows animal husbandry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the herd of sheep  --  at a high valuation . Well , John just ca n't manage it , no matter how hard he works . I 'll have to handle a sheriff 's sale there , before we 're married , even . "  | " Oh , not that soon , I hope , darling ! Tell me , did Bryson make that deal when Dr. Adler was sick ? " " Of course . Old Adler would never have approved , if he 'd been on deck . By the way , how 's Dr. Lawson now ? " " He 's failing fast , Peter . You know they 've moved up to the hospital , so he can conserve his strength . That 's why I 'm living there now ; to help take care of him . I think Dr. Lawson'sthe most wonderful man on the island  --  with just one exception , of course . Jill says his operation on Sadie Banks was simply marvelous . She helped him , you know . " " Jill is really developing as a medico then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only thing is . . " Is what ? " " Well , she 's so sad about Jim Showalter . Every day she carries his picture from home to her desk and then back home again . And then she has these curious abstracted spells . Often I find her just sitting , looking out into space and when I speak she does n't even hear me . You have the impression that the real Jill is off in the old time belt . Still , Dr. Griffin says she 's always right on the ball whenever it 's really important . She 's certainly far more able than I am . You ought to know the worst about me before it 's too late , Peter . " " I 'll take my chance . But on this marriage business , Mary ; just how are you fixed ? How much do you make at the hospitaland how much at the school ? " " That depends . I 'm extra nurse at the hospital and , if Mrs. Lawson is pressed , she can call on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school . You know I teach hygiene and gymnasium and do n't laugh , Peter  --  I also teach the older children Latin and French and Art . If I do n't go , then those classes are skipped . When Madeleine 's married , she may want me to take over more of her work . I do n't know . On the other hand , Polly 's offered to teach French , and Russian too , in night school . There 's an awful row about that . " " Yes , Colonel Showalter exploded to me the other day . But he 's coming to the wedding tomorrow . He says it 's a real ad/vance when a Communist recognizes marriage as an institution , and he wants to witness it personally . " " Well , it is high time they were married , Peter . " " You mean after living in sin the way they did ? " " Well , more particularly  --  Peter , if you do n't know it already , for goodness ' sake do n't say I said so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention it , except that sort of secret ca n't be kept . " Peter whistled . " You do n't mean it ? Well , how would I know ? The Islander does n't have a gossip column . It does n't show . I think Maddy has the most wonderful figure on the island  --  with just one exception , if I may paraphrase you . " " Oh , Peter , I 'd like to keep my figure , for your sake . But I 'd like to have children even more  --  four at least  --  all of them a little bit like you ; not altogether like , though . " " Well , good-by to your figure then , to say nothing of my savings account . Have you got an account at the bank , Mary ? " " Peter , dear , I do n't save any money . They just give me board at the hospital and , when I teach , I get a small per diem . Last week it amounted to all of twenty adlers . I give those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Of course , when we 're married , you 'll get them . " " It 's going to be hard sledding , Mary . Trouble with me is I did n't have any loose change lying around at the time of the bombing . Just had some dollar bills , and now they 're worthless . The well-to-do people are those whose kids had piggy banks . Bill Jefferson was telling me , Estelle had 123 pennies saved up . He took it to the bank and opened an account for her . Twelve point thirty gumptions  --  think of it ! Why , Estelle 's an heiress ! " " Oh , Peter , you remind me . I 'd meant to tell you , but then John Stokes came up and we got talking about the moon . I was clearing out my bureau the other day and I found ten silver dollars Daddy gave me one Christmas years ago . That 's nice , is n't it ? " 186Past Subjunctive " Nice ! Mary , do you know what you 're saying ? Ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not bills ? " " Yes , coins  --  those great big cartwheel things . They 're all wrapped in cotton wool and still bright and shiny . " " Ten silver dollars ! Darling , that 's a hundred gumptions ! It 's almost enough to start a rival bank . It 's more than enough to start me  --  us  --  in business any time . It 's equal to all my salary for almost five months . I take it back about Estelle  --  you 're the real island heiress . Why , if I 'd known that , I would n't have dared to propose . " " I thought it might possibly help you to set the date , " said Mary demurely . " The date ? How about January 7 , my twenty-sixth birthday ? That 's just two weeks , for it must be well into Christmas have now . " " Oh , Peter , " said Mary softly , turning her lips to his.  |p188FACES  WERE SOFTENED by the pools of lamplight at either end of the long table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Greg Waynfleet discussed columns of figures . Towards the center of the big room that had been the corporationoffice , the five members of the Council chatted amicably . As a burst of laughter marked the termination of Colonel Showalter 's anecdote , Walter Travis placed his watch by the pile of papers before him . " It 's eight o'clock , " he announced . " We have a heavy agenda and , since they 've been posted as provided , I 'll assume approval of the previous minutes . Greg , what 's on the list of unfinished business ? " Turning from the two bank managers , the harassed Recorderof Gumption Island reached for his notebook . " Just the Edminster Proposal , " he said . " We should be able to dispose of that quickly , one way or the other , " commented the chairman . " Gil , do you have anything to add to what you said last week ? " " Only that I do n't think the issue was settled by Tom 's editorial this morning , " replied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more marriages and the more we have , the more tangled this representation system will become .

They both "  |p189Travis  rapped sharply . " You 're out of order , Reggie , " he said brusquely . " Please observe the rule about speaking in turn . David , what 's your pleasure ? " " I think the present system is admirable , " commented the priest . " As The Islander says , territorial representation did n't prove satisfactory in the United States . In metropolitanareas , you had well-to-do suburbs wholly indifferent to conditions in nearby slums . Many American communities had lost the town meeting ' feeling that our scheme of representationhas helped to reanimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's definite , " observed Travis . " I might observe , Father , that the slum problem on Gumption Island is n't pressing . " " It soon will be , " snorted the colonel , " the way the garbage is thrown about . " " Order , please , " said Travis . " Bill ? " The big Negro leaned forward , clasping his huge hands . " What we'se arranged seems to me good fo ' all of us , " he said slowly . " I doan feel I was ' lected jes ' to speak fo ' Houseboat Cove and , of I wuz , I know I 'd be much more pro-cullud den I tries to be . I votes agin this motion . " " And you , Reggie ?

So the proposed amendment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we take up the budget ? " " Well , what about this garbage ? " demanded Colonel Showalter . " I know people are supposed to bury their own , but they do n't . George Garvey just throws his restaurant refuse into the ocean , and half of it washes up again . We 're going to have rats all over the place , if that goes on . Already they 're terrible over by the Cove , for which Bill Jefferson is so careful to take no responsibility . You colored people talk a lot about equality of citizenship , Bill . Why do n't you advocateequality of cleanliness ? "  | " Dat ai n't fair , Colonel , " sputtered the Negro . " Gib us a chance and we'se jes ' as clean as anybody . " " We , " gibed Showalter . " What d'ye mean by we ' ? People whose names begin with H to L ? The Hellions  --  they 're your constituents .

If it comes under Health and Education , it 's Father Brown 's concern . I give the assignment to Bill . Greg , please note that at our next meeting Bill will report on violationsof the garbage disposal ordinance . Well , what is it , David ? " The priest lowered the hand he had meekly raised . " I do n't contest your decision , Mr. Chairman , " he said . " I think the garbage issue belongs under Public Welfare . But the remark about Garvey throwing his refuse into the ocean leads to another question . " " Keep it short , " said Travis roughly . " We ca n't spend all evening on trivialities . We 've got Adler and Bryson here to explain the budget and the taxation schedule . That 's pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be even more important , " said Father Brown . " If George Garvey chooses the right time to throw his trash in the ocean , we may not have any garbage disposal problem there . The tide is coming back . And before long it could be strong enough to sweep stuff away . Not only garbage , either . " There was a moment of silence . " Yes , I see what you mean , " replied Walter thoughtfully . " The return of the moon  --  if it is the moon  --  and all the implications . " " It 's a moon , anyhow , " commented Edminster . " Admiral Evans has been taking observations every night for a week now . In that time , he says it 's grown nearly a quarter of a diameter . He 's trying to work out the speed of approach . "  | " Well , bring Reggie in on the astronomy so he can report on that next week , too , " said Travis decisively . " I assume it falls under Security . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no objection , we 'll proceed to the budget . Albert , you and Ken have the floor . " At the far end of the long table , Dr. Adler arranged his papers neatly beside the primitive lamp and rose to his feet . " I do n't want to seem formal , gentlemen , " he said . " But I can explain things better if I 'm standing . Of course , it 's always a pleasure to attend your meetings . Tonight we 're more a part of the team than usual . We 've divided our task . Ken will discuss the estimates . I 'll propose certain modifications in the budget which have become advisable since we presented it five weeks ago . First , however , I want to make a constitutional point . " " Let me perhaps save time , " interrupted Travis , " by saying that we all understand the constitutional picture . Our control over the budget is limited . We can cut it down , but ca n't increase it without raising the additional revenue to secure a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax is ten per cent . As a matter of fact , Albert , I 've had representations urging that the rate should n't be above five per cent this first year . There 's a feeling that we ought to encourage capital accumulation . " " With which the bank managers wholly agree , " said Dr. Adler suavely . " From what we have heard , however , we think there may be some misunderstanding about the disposition of the bank 's profits . That should be wholly clear before you propose any downward revision of the tax rate . " " I 've always assumed , " said Travis , " that the profits of the bank , if any , are at the disposition of the Council . " " That , " replied Adler , " is precisely the misapprehension we want to correct . Your assumption would run counter to the constitutional safeguards against any form of double taxation on Gumption Island . " " ' Scuse me , gennelmen , " interposed Bill Jefferson.  | " But I doan rightly unnerstand what double taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adler , " is simply what the words imply . Two direct taxes levied simultaneously on a single source of revenue . " " I do n't see how there can be any misunderstanding , " commentedEdminster . " Here it is , at the beginning of Paragraph3 , Section 3 , Article II of the Constitution : There shall be no taxes of any kind , other than those on incomes and estates . ' An income tax and an estate tax are n't levied on the same source of revenue . " " That in itself might be questioned , " said Dr. Adler . " But if so , we must be the more careful that we do n't unwittingly introduce a more barefaced form of double taxation . I mean the taxation of a company 's profits coupled with the further taxation of income from dividends already reduced by the initial tax . " " Surely , " protested Edminster , " that only applies to the shareholders of a corporation . We do n't have any corporationson Gumption Island  --  at least none that I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving at , " said Walter slowly . " He 's referring to the bank . That 's a corporation all right , established by the Constitution itself . Albert is suggesting that because his income from that source , and that of Ken Bryson as co-manager , is taxable , the profits made by the bank should not be . " " That 's about it , Mr. Chairman , except I would say ' cannotbe . ' Of course , Mr. Bryson and I are not favoring ourselves . The same rule will apply to any other corporation established on the island . Its profits as such will not be taxable . Only the income actually received by employes and shareholders , in salaries and dividends , would be liable to tax . " " I doan know how that 's goin ' to set with Abe Lincoln , " remarkedBill . " He 's always talkin ' about how corporations suck the blood of the people . Now you says they kaint be taxed at all . "  | " There you go again , Bill , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abe Lincoln . I 'm his representative . L through S. Abe has a point , though . Tell him to talk to me about it . " " If you please , " said Walter . " Dr. Adler has the floor . Any questions had better be directed through me . All right , Gil . " " I do n't believe Dr. Adler is correct about the bank , " respondedEdminster . " It 's obvious from the Constitution that it 's a special case . Listen to this  --  first sentence of Section 4 , Article II : All assets and income of the Bank shall be held in trust for the people of Gumption Island . ' " " It says assets , not profits , Edminster , " retorted Adler quietly . " Does n't a profit become an asset , as soon as the profit is definite ? " " No more than an architect 's blueprint automatically becomes a finished building . The profits may have been hypothecatedin advance , for any number of purposes . Mr. Chairman , this is serious . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free economy that is growing so vigorouslyhere will wither away . That 's what was happening to small business in the United States . Fortunately , our institutionswere set up to prevent such confiscatory practice . Therefore , Bryson and I maintain that all profits of the Bank are nontaxable as such , and that it rests within our trust as duly elected managers to dispose of them at our dis-cretion . " " I ca n't see it , " protested Edminster . " Suppose , for the sake of argument , we admit that profits are n't assets . Still , the Constitution stipulates that all income ' of the bank shall also be held in trust for the people . That does n't mean you can dispose of it at your discretion . " " You 're one hundred per cent wrong , " interposed Bryson aggressively . " Money in trust is n't money in escrow . Trusteesare not deprived of the power to act . And the Constitutionclearly implies that the duly elected bank managers are the trustees in this matter . If not , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we all agree that double taxation is discouraged by the Constitution . We do n't all conclude from this that the profits of a public corporation are at the disposalof its managers . I think that issue must be decided by Judge Anderson . I doubt that we can come to a determinationourselves . " " I might say , Mr. Chairman , " observed Bryson , " that we already have an advisory opinion . Of course , if anybody questions our eventual conduct as trustees , they can bring suit against Dr. Adler and me for misappropriation of publicfunds . " " They 's a provision fo ' impeachment , too , " warned Bill Jefferson . " By a four-fifths vote of the Council , " Dr. Adler shot back . " If you want to discuss that now , Bryson and I will gladly retire . " " Come , come , gentlemen , " said Walter . " Let 's be mature . Unless and until suit is brought , I do n't believe we can deny validity to the managers ' rather staggering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposition of bank profits will be reported and audited . On that disposition the case , if any , will rest . So , with your permission , we 'll now proceed with the budget . We 've had the figures for over a month . I gather , Dr. Adler , that you want to revise them ? " " There 's no constitutional provision for that , " asserted Edminster . " There 's certainly no prohibition of revision that does n't unbalance the budget , " retorted Adler . " Our revisions are fortunately due to initial underestimates of revenue . Gross national product here is developing so rapidly that ProfessorStevens insists we raise the estimates of total income for the coming year . He wanted them upped 15 per cent from what we calculated a little over a month ago . Bryson and I agree the revenue estimates should be increased by 12 per cent , which is conservative . I assume you all are familiar with the original figures ? " Travis took a typewritten sheet from the pile before him.  | " Your original report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island for the ensuing year at 50,000 gumptions . I gather the figure is basically the number of anticipated workdays , at an average return of one gumption per diem ? " " That 's correct . Between the ages of 12 and 65 , we have a population of 129 people , male and female . Counting all these as producers , allowing 350 working days in the year , and averaging a gumption a day , we get 129 times 350 or 45,150 . Dr. Stevens made discounts for illness , accidents , extra holidays , and unremunerated work . Then he considered factors on the plus side , such as a rising wage rate , increasing velocity of currency , and more night work as a result of betterillumination . He also allowed for some release of hoarded coin and for a progressive rate of credit expansion . You 've seen all the calculations , Walter . The final estimate was a total national income of approximately 50,000 gumptions . Now , for two reasons , we think that 's too low . " " It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " if you 'll state those reasons . " " Well , first of all , we guessed wrong on the hoarding . Insteadof keeping their dimes and quarters , everybody 's been turning them in for our newly printed paper money  --  even pennies for caps , as I 'm happy to say the adlers are now known . The result is more currency , circulating at a faster rate than we had expected . " " If you 're interested in details , " interposed Bryson , " young Perry Warren 's had something to do with it . He 's developedthis registry service , so you can deposit and withdraw by mail . Fewer people are coming to the bank , but our business is going up by leaps and bounds . The week before Christmaswas terrific . You know , perhaps , that Perry worked from daylight to dark on Christmas Day . " " I know he was n't at church , " said Father Brown acidly . " And I 'm wondering how , with 52 Sundays , to say nothing of the saints I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ? "  | " Wait a minute , David , " said the chairman firmly .. " What 's your second inflationary factor , Albert ? " " The rising volume of credit . We 're holding it down as much as we can , but everybody wants to borrow to get some sort of business started . Then , we 've just had a surprise from Peter Clarke . He 's turned up ten silver dollars somewhere  --  that 's a hundred gumptions . And he 's deposited it under the name of the Great A and P Insurance Company  --  that 's Anderson and Peter . He plans to insure everything , from sunstroke to crop failure . That alone could speed up commercialactivity . Cover losses and people take more risks ! " " Do I gather , " inquired Walter , " that with this increased economic activity you think taxes might be reduced below the ten per cent we 're collecting ? " " To do so would stimulate business further , and might resultin a higher actual yield . But if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bryson on the spending side . He 's analyzed all the estimates made by you administrative of-ficers . " " I have several questions with some bearing on the subject of business activity , " said Father Brown . " A little later , " ruled the chairman . " Ken , the floor is yours . " The stern-faced banker , thinner and less immaculate than formerly , rose in his turn , glancing at a sheet of memoranda . " Albert , " he said , " has told you that we estimated the total island income for next year at 50,000 gumptions . On that basis with the flat ten per cent income tax and no allowance for death duties , we would expect revenue of 5000 gumptions . After discussion with you we advised that this be divided among the five departments as follows : Finance , 1500 ; Health and Education , 1200 ; Public Works , 1000 ; Security , 800 ; Welfare , 500 . " " Of course , " interrupted Travis , " the Council decides the allocation . " " Certainly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dutyp197to suggest the breakdown , since no deficit can be incurred without our approval . Now , as Albert has explained , we anticipatea broader taxable base , bringing total income to 56,000 gumptions . But it should be possible to keep the expendituresto the original estimates . If so , that would cut the tax rate to just under nine per cent . " " We assume , " said Dr. Adler , " that you 'll want to keep it a flat rate , remembering the disastrous American experience with so-called progressive taxation . " " What disposition will be made of the estate taxes , if any fall in ? " asked Travis . " That , Walter , " replied Bryson , " would be for you as Director of Finance to decide . I suppose you would deposit such windfalls to the account of the Council , regarding them as a reserve against unanticipated needs . Under the Constitution , it is clearly undesirable for the Council to incur any debt other than short-term borrowing from the bank at our discretion . A funded debt is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any uncovered obligations a year hence would have to be made up by you gentlemen per-sonally . " " In that event , " commented Edminster , " there 'd be a strong temptation for the Council to murder our wealthiest citizen . " " Of course , " the chairman frowned , " we 've discussed this over and over among ourselves . Nobody here thinks he can meet his departmental needs easily on the sums suggested . But we 're all willing to try . I 'll ask each administrator to express his own opinion ; you first , David . " Father Brown rose , looking unusually stern . " I recognize , " he said , " that Health and Education is allowed more than any other department , except Finance . But I think , subject to correction , that our need is greatest . Until we acquire more individual wealth , both the hospital and the school will need some governmental subvention . The church , perhaps , is different . It has learned how to support itself and I think will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thep198unholy assumptions that Sunday is a day to labor , and that every child should interrupt schooling at twelve , as the estimatesof income imply . I can not agree to either of those diabolical suggestions . " A round of applause , from all but the two bank managersand Travis , approved the priest 's viewpoint . " How about you , Gil ? " inquired the chairman . " I 'm chiefly worried about keeping the dykes in good repair , " said the architect . " There 's no possible way of foretellingwhat may be needed . As you well know , all the roads are in bad shape , but we 'll have to let that slide . I 'd like to reportthat Colonel Showalter and I are working together as closely as possible . Some of his wants can properly be classifiedas public works . " " What do you say , Bill ? " asked Travis . " I says I 'll do the bes ' I can wid the little money allowed me , " replied the Negro . " Father Brown an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of it widout gEtin ' their advice first . " " And you , Reggie ? " " The budget for Security , " said Colonel Showalter , " is almost farcical . It works out at less than 16 gumptions a week . Even if I do n't charge half of my own time , that does n't permit me to build up materiel or employ any staff , let alone train a corporal 's guard . But of course I 'll also do the best I can and it 's encouraging to hear Gilbert say that he sees the security significance of public works . " " Well , " said Travis , " that makes it my turn . I 'm sure the bank managers realize , from what 's been said , that the Council would like to co-operate in lowering the tax rate . That makes it the more unpleasant for me to disagree , especiallysince my budget as Director of Finance amounts to 30 per cent of the whole . But we must face the facts . I have to pay the full-time salaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five gumptions a week and , frankly , I do n't think Peter Clarke has been earning it . I 'm glad to hear he 's going into business on his own . Greg Wayn/fleet , here , gets six gumptions a week as Recorder and I hope he can make out on that , for we 'd be sunk without him . " " As a bachelor , I can make out so far as the money goes , " responded Waynfleet . " But the volume of work is appalling . I 'll say frankly that , unless I get an assistant , it will be impossible for me to be a churchgoer . " " Suppose we get a new sheriff , " continued Travis . " I 'm thinking of Billy Watson , at four gumptions a week . Even that , plus six , is ten , meaning 520 a year . That leaves me under 1000 gumptions to pay the big per diems and all my incidentals . " Ostensibly , the bank managers , and Judge Anderson , are on a per diem basis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their time to the job . Yet their remuneration , for this month of December now closing , is the meager sum of 30 gumptions apiece . No wonder if they eye the bank profits a little enviously ! During December , Judge Anderson has received exactly 19 gumptions for his important work . Projecting that total for the coming year , we get 79 times 12 or 948 gumptions . Add that to the 520 for salaries and it makes 1468 gumptions out of my total appropriation of 1500 . I will admit one pleasant factor . Contrary to Father Brown 's expectation , both school and hospital promise to cover costs from charges next year . " " So you balance nicely , " said Colonel Showalter . " Oh , I balance , do I ? All right , Reggie , here 's your fee for services tonight  --  one penny , or ten caps . Even that , for the seven of us here , is seven-tenths of a gumption . Figure an average attendance of six at the weekly Council meetings throughout the year and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ munificent directors ' fees . Now add that 31.2 to the other 1468 gumptions of expenditure and you have outlay of 1499.2 against income appropriation of 1500 . Yes , gentlemen , you can call it a balance , so long as nothing shakes the tightrope . " " You 've been a leading critic of bureaucracy , " observed the colonel.  | " And I do n't withdraw a word of it , " retorted Travis sharply . " But if we 're going to have any government at all , it 's got to be financed . So I conclude , Albert , that the tax rate will have to stay at ten per cent . Then , if the revenues do increase as you anticipate , we 'll get by . That 's all I have to say . Yes , David , please do n't talk as long as I have . " The little priest rose again , stood for a moment silent and then spoke softly . At the far end of the table Adler and Brysonleaned forward to hear him better , above the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two lamps jumped and flickered in the drafts that penetrated the shaken building . " I have a point of some delicacy to raise , " said Father Brown at last . " And if I do it crudely you must blame my ignorance of financial matters . " Again he paused for a moment , then turned his eyes squarely on the two bank managersand resumed . " I can understand that the Church must face the mundane primacy of business activity . I am not asking for Blue Laws , and I shall defer further comment on Sunday work until I have talked with Bobby Macpherson . " What I can not understand is the seemingly privileged position of the Bank of Gumption Island . It is established by the Constitution as the fiscal agent of our government . The Constitution says flatly that : All assets and income of the Bank shall be held in trust for the people of Gumption Island . ' Yet it was asserted here tonight that its profits , which I anticipate will be large , should be wholly at the disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to me wrong in principle and additionally improper because of the shortage of public funds as emphasized by all my colleagues on the Council . " He paused again , observing Dr. Adler and Bryson . The former now half-reclined in his chair , with eyes closed ; the latter still leaning forward , alert to answer back . " The Constitution says further , " the priest resumed , " that all legislative and administrative powers granted by the people ' are vested in this Council . We are their directlyp201elected representatives and the authorized custodians of their interests . I therefore move that , beginning January 1 , all profits of the bank be paid over to the Director of Finance , for such disposition within the budget as this Council may deem appropriate . " " I second the motion , " said Gilbert Edminster . Dr. Adler 's eyes opened , with no other change in his nonchalantposture . " If that motion is carried , " he warned coldly , " I may feel it necessary to withdraw the gold reserve , which is not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my private property . " " Moreover , " shouted Ken Bryson , " the motion is clearly unconstitutional . It would , in effect , make Dr. Adler and me full-time employes of government . Article IV , Section 1 , limits such employes to a Recorder and a Sheriff . " Walter Travis was on his feet . " Gentlemen , " he said firmly . " The issue now raised is complicated and far-reaching . It 's ten o'clock . All of us are tired and some tempers may be a little frayed . Do you want to thrash this out now or sleep on it and meet again tomorrow morning ? What is your pleasure ? " Bryson rose angrily . " It is n't our pleasure , but it is our duty to settle the matter here and now , " he stormed . " I do n't know how it is with the Council members , but tomorrow morningat eight Dr. Adler and I must be at the bank . If we 're not there , the whole developing economy of this island will bog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we stand . With your permission , I 'll speak to this motion from the viewpoint of a manager entitled to attend , and therefore I assume to be heard , at every meeting of the Council . " " Okeh , " said Travis pleasantly , and took his seat . " You handled that very well , Walter , " said Father Brown to Travis as they turned off Bayswater Drive and heard the footsteps of the others die away ; " very well indeed . " It was past midnight . The strong south wind blew gustily ,
