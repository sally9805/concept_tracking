Outside the Iron Curtain , Italy has more state-run businesses than any other European country . When Italy became a nation 96 years ago , her government inherited a Genoese shipyard from the old kingdom of Sardinia , and that was the state 's start in business . Under 21 years of Fascism , the government got more and more deeply mixed up in the economy , and has never since got out of it . Today the government mines all of Italy 's coal and 80% of her iron ore ; it produces more than three-quarters of the nation 's pig iron and half its steel , enjoys a monopoly or near monopoly of rail , sea and air transport , and competes with private industry in the manufacture of scores of products ranging from chocolates to Alfa Romeo cars . <P> Most of these diverse interests are managed for the government by enti , autonomous administrations which today number more than 1,000 . ( Exactly how many more nobody knows . ) Perhaps 200 of these corporations , e.g. , the Imperial African Transport Society and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since outlived their functions and represent a net loss to the Italian taxpayers . But even more of a menace to Italy 's economic health are such aggressive , purposeful enti as E.N.I. , the burgeoning oil and gas corporation which , under the leadership of hard-driving Enrico Mattei ( TIME , Nov. 29 , 1954 ) , has waged a determined fight to prevent private capital from sharing in Italy 's oil development . <P> Quivering Left . Three months ago wispy , white-maned Premier Antonio Segni won parliamentary approval for his plan to put all state-owned corporations under a single " Ministry of State Holdings . " The right was worried : in the hands of a zealous left-winger , the new ministry could spearhead an all-out assault on Italian free enterprise . <P> Last week Italy 's free enterprisers abruptly stopped quivering . In a move that surprised friends and foes alike , Segni gave the new Cabinet post to brawny , brawling Giuseppe Togni , 53-year-old founder-president of CIDA , the Italian business executive union . A onetime marble cutter who worked his way up to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Christian Democrat Togni is a vocal exponent of free enterprise . He is also one of Italy 's most unrestrained antiCommunists , two years ago set off the worst riot in Italian parliamentary history by bellowing at Communist deputies : " I would like to know how many ex-spies of the OVRA Fascist secret police there are in your ranks . " <P> Profits &; Losses . Togni 's appointment outraged the Italian left . Vice Premier Giuseppe Saragat was hard put to hold his Social Democrats in the government coalition . ( Their departure might have toppled the Segni government , which won its last vote of confidence by a majority of three. )
