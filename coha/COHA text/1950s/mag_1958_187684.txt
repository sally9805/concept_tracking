On the surface the Middle East was relatively quiet : not a single government collapsed , only two bombs were exploded ( in Lebanon ) , only one political plot frustrated ( in Jordan ) . Nevertheless , events happened in the Middle East like the first pebbles of an avalanche , and almost all of them fell in a direction favorable to Egypt 's Nasser . <P> Lebanon . The election of General Fuad Chehab to the presidency relaxed tension but did not end it . Lebanese rebels insist on remaining under arms until President Camille Chamoun steps down and U.S. troops depart ; Chamoun , not to be outdone , insists on serving out his term to the final minute on Sept. 23 . President-elect Chehab ducked all responsibility : the opposition wildly protested the return of Dr. Charles Malik as Lebanon 's U.N . representative , and Dr. Malik wanted Chehab 's endorsement before leaving for Manhattan . Chehab , as usual , was cagily silent . As a brutal reminder that the rebel-enforced general strike , so harmful to trade , was supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing two innocent bystanders and wounding another . While U.S. marines got their first liberty , 2,000 at a time , in Beirut , a pro-Chamoun leader and two of his aides were found near the Syrian border with their throats slit from ear to ear . <P> Lebanon 's Prime Minister Sami Solh , who narrowly escaped assassination two weeks ago on the road from Bit Meri and was irate at the rebels ' continued holdout , tendered his resignation , but President Chamoun refused it . Puffing worriedly on a hubble-bubble water pipe , Solh told newsmen that he could have been butchered as was Iraq 's Nuri asSaid " if the American forces had been 24 hours late . " He went on : " The rebels , who had massed fresh forces and ammunition from Syria , were to launch a big attack shortly after the Iraqi coup . Had the U.S. not acted in time , the massacres would have dwarfed those of 1860* and would have been comparable only to the Armenian massacres in Turkey during World War I. " <P> Jordan . Reassured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under heavy guard , began to move about more freely , helicoptered to the Jordanian sector of Jerusalem where he told a Jordanian army audience " we shall never allow troublemakers , Communist lackeys and atheists to succeed in undermining this nation . " But the arrests of pro-Nasser suspects continued with monotonous regularity : 27 Jordanians were standing trial for smuggling in guns and munitions from Syria , and several of them seemed certain to be publicly hanged ; 20 others were swept up by the police as members of a gang of terrorists and bomb throwers . The clandestine radios screamed for Hussein 's death ; the Damascus newspaper Al Nasr al Jadid , jeered : " Jordan has turned into a huge prison ! " <P> Four U.S. engineers arrived to try to improve Jordan 's incredible desert railroads ( of 21 locomotives , only five are operable ) and to devise a method of speeding up the unloading of cargo at the shallow-draft port of Aqaba . For the British , who are holding the lid tight on this boiling cauldron , the situation is becoming critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it solves .
