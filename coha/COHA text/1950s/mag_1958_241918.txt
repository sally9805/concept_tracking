Only two days after his suicide , the New York Central 's Board Chairman Robert R. Young won a belated victory last week . After a bitter , 2-year battle between Young and Randolph Phillips , a former associate , the U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way for one of Young 's pet projects : a plan to wipe out $18 million in dividend arrears to preferred stockholders of Young 's Alleghany Corp. , which has working control of the Central with 973,500 shares of stock . Under the plan , each share of Alleghany 's 5% preferred stock would be exchanged for ten shares of new 6% preferred , convertible to common stock in 15 years . <P> Young hoped to use the stock as collateral for new acquisitions , but Phillips froze it . He got a New York district court ruling that Alleghany fell under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission rather than the Interstate Commerce Commission , which approved the issue . When the Supreme Court reversed this ruling , the lower court held that Alleghany had illegally acquired control of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICC approval . The court ruled that ICC would have to settle that matter before it could properly approve the new issue . The Supreme Court last week decided that the question of Central 's acquisition was irrelevant , ordered the lower court to rule on the stock issue alone . Since the district court never questioned ICC 's power to approve the new issue ultimately , it seemed to have little choice but to release the stock-though Phillips might delay the release by further appeals to the Supreme Court . <P> As Alleghany got the good news , directors voted in Allan P. Kirby , 65 , Alleghany president and silent financial backer of Young for the last 20 years to succeed Young as Alleghany chairman . Five-and-Ten-Store Heir Kirby , largest single stockholder in both Alleghany ( 516,500 common shares ) and Central ( 300,100 shares ) , will continue as president , also become chairman of the executive committee . <P> Kirby has always stayed in the background , is expected to leave active operation of Alleghany to younger men . Among them : Vice President and Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas J. Deegan , 47 , Young 's right-hand man , and Kirby 's son , Fred M. , 38 . Still to be decided on : a chairman for the New York Central to succeed Bob Young , who left his wife his entire personal estate , valued last week at more than $6,000,000 , plus substantial real-estate holdings .
