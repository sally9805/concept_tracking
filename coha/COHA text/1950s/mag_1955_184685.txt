At 8 o'clock one morning last week a neatly dressed Negro in a natty brown suit parked his old Ford in an alley in Port Elizabeth , South Africa , and after glancing furtively around , hurried into a dingy building that had once been a garage Under his arm was a small blackboard wrapped in newspapers ; in his pockets were bits of chalk ; and awaiting him inside the building were 38 Negro children , sitting silent on wooden benches . Before he turned to them , however , the man first carefully locked the door . He had good reason : his is an illegal school . <P> Since the South African government put the Bantu Education Act into effect last spring , scores of such schools have sprung up . especially in the area around Johannesburg . Though the Bantu Act did not actually deprive South African Negroes of their regular schools , it imposed a curriculum that was designed to do nothing less than to convince every Negro child that he is inferior . Last April , thousands of students boycotted their schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F. Verwoerd , one of the architects of apartheid , retaliated by closing the boycotted buildings , thus leaving some 7,000 children without any education at all . Partly to take care of these , the African National Congress sponsored its network of secret , classes . <P> Since then , the Special Branch , i.e. , political police , has been kept busy with the strange task of tracking down " knowledge crooks . " These are the teachers who assemble small classes in private homes , alleys and backyards and who , if caught , are subject to a $140 fine and six months in jail . The police look for such evidence as boxes of chalk or bottles of ink . Once they hauled in a teacher and claimed they had caught him red-handed " pointing at a blackboard . " But so far , such arrests have been few . When their classrooms are raided , the children simply say they are having a party . <P> Last week the African National Congress and the African Education Movement added a new wrinkle to their bootlegging of knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can gather for lessons . The pupils call themselves " members/ ' the teachers are " group leaders , " the classes are " meetings . " By next fall these new clubs hope to have 20,000 children learning their history , geography and languages through quiz games and " talking newspapers , " their 3 Rs through songs ( " A for Africa , B for Ball . We are happy one and all " ) . <P> But the teachers who are risking their freedom for the cause know full well that Minister Verwoerd will never rest until every bootleg school , every club and every knowledge crook is put out of business . After all , Minister Verwoerd has a cause of his own . " Natives , " he once declared , " must be taught from childhood to realize that equality with the European is not for them .
