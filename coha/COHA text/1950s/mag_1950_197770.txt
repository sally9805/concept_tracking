Most radio whodunits rely on tough-talking private eyes , glossy gun molls and satanic scientists . By avoiding such standard characters , Dragnet ( Thurs. 10:30 p.m . E.D.T. , NBC ) lags in the Nielsen ratings , but it has won a devoted following among policemen from New Haven to San Diego , who welcome Dragnet 's non-nonsense approach . Says 30-year-old Jack Webb , creator of the show : " We do n't do it by underplaying-because underplaying is still acting . We try to make it as real as a guy pouring a cup of coffee . " <P> Each episode of Dragnet is " the documented drama of an actual crime " taken from the files of the Los Angeles police . Webb , who also plays matter-of-fact Police Sergeant Joe Friday , says : " We use the oldfashioned , plain way of reporting , where you do n't know any more than the cops do . It makes you a cop and you unwind the story . " <P> Rhythm of the Relay . The realistic approach is often a sound-man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 300-odd sound effects on each show . Webb 's trickiest piece of realism came when the script called for a long-distance phone call from Los Angeles to Fountain Green , Utah . " We actually placed the call and recorded it . We got all the line clicks of the trunk lines , the rhythm of the operators as they moved the call from one relay point to another . You ca n't fake stuff like the authentic way an operator says ' One moment , please . ' " Two telephone operators wrote in , praising the show . The telephone company wrote in , too , warning that their equipment could not be used for such stunts . <P> Even more important than sounds in the night is the jargon of the police . Instead of the familiar " Calling all cars , " Dragnet uses the duller but truer " Attention all units , " making sure that it is accompanied by a rush of air through the microphone ( called a " squelch " ) , because most police radio dispatchers ' are not educated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Large . Because its stories are based on actual cases , Dragnet breaks a few taboos . A program dealing with sex criminals " drew not one official or unofficial protest , " and the city of Detroit borrowed the recording ( minus the advertising plugs for Fatima cigarettes ) as the climax broadcast of a campaign against sex crimes . The most mail was pulled by a Christmas show called " The Rifle . " It dealt with a small boy who found the hiding place of his Christmas-present rifle in plenty of time to kill a playmate . The National Rifle Association protested strongly . Webb turned their letter over to the Los Angeles police , who promised the association ten more shows illustrating the folly of giving rifles to children . <P> Last week , as it rounded out its first year on radio , Dragnet 's realism reached a new high : the criminal got away . " We do n't try to punch a moral , " says Webb . " If there 's one in the show , the people get it . We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does . "
