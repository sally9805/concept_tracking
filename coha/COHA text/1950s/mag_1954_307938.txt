He also puts out a monthly house-organ Facts Forum News , which goes free to a mailing list including Congressmen , radio-TV stations , newspapers , commentators , etc . Last week word got out that Oilman Hunt had bigger publishing ambitions . To Manhattan he had sent a representative to try to buy two big national magazines , monthly Coronet ( circ. 3,565,122 ) and biweekly Collier 's ( circ. 2,818,003 ) .
