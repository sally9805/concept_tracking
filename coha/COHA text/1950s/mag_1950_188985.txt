The final all-night conference broke up with a formal exchange of recriminations for the record . " A wasteful and unnecessary thing , " said Chrysler . An " arrogant and stubborn attitude , " said the United Auto Workers . Smiling cheerfully , the U.A.W. 's cocky President Walter Reuther stalked out of Detroit 's Sheraton Hotel , trailing a school of lesser negotiators behind him . One of them stopped for a moment to give the word to waiting newsmen : " The strike is on , my boys . " <P> His word was hardly necessary . A full 15 minutes earlier , U.A.W. workers had quietly started filing out of the gates at Chrysler plants all around industrial Detroit . Outside the main Dodge plant in Hamtramck a newsboy unloaded a six-foot stack of extras and was peddling strike headlines ten minutes before the deadline . <P> " Free Vacation . " It all rolled off as smoothly as a new Plymouth coming off the assembly line . At the big Highland Park unit , a mobile crane operator stopped his machine just inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , to join the departing crowds . <P> The strikers grinned self-consciously and joked among themselves . " Free vacation , " shouted one . " Let 's go to Florida . " Remarked another , matter-of-factly : " This is n't so good . The best time to strike is when it 's a little warmer . " Within a couple of hours only token picket lines plodded mechanically back &; forth . <P> Explained one union official : " Look , we 've got this thing down to a system . I 'll admit that it 's boring . The whole town 's unionized and nobody 's going to cross a picket line , whether pickets are there or not . Why wear out shoe leather ? " <P> " A Mean One . " But for all the studied indifference , the U.A.W. was digging in for a long and wearing struggle with the nation 's second largest automaker . Ever since last July , Reuther had been haggling with Chrysler for the same kind of pension package he won from Ford and hoped to get from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits . <P> Chrysler turned him down cold . It was willing to pay whatever it took to provide $100-a-month pensions ( including social security ) , but it was dead set against putting a price tag on the bargain . Chrysler would guarantee the pensions ; it was none of the union 's concern how much they cost or how they were administered . <P> This week , with no sign of a break in the deadlock , the walkout of 89,000 Chrysler employees was spreading to Chrysler suppliers . Briggs Manufacturing Co. , which makes many of Chrysler 's bodies , had laid off 23,000 workers , other parts makers had laid off thousands more ; altogether nearly 120,000 were out of work . Crumped one Chrysler employee : " This could be a mean one . "
