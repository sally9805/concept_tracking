Photographer Ralph P. Creer of Chicago , who specializes in medical pictures , had often heard that human and animal eyes are natural cameras . But he had never seen any pictures taken with them . Creer got a collection of pig , sheep and beef eyes from Chicago 's stockyards and set to work . <P> First he tried to put photographic film into an eye near the center of the retina , the point where the lens brings the image naturally to a focus . This did not work ; eye fluids ruined the film . So he cut a small hole in the rear of the eyeball and placed in it a disk of film about as big as a pea . When an object was held six inches away , the lens of the eye brought its image to a focus on the film . The aperture of this " camera , " he figured , was somewhere between fI.9 and f3 . <P> Then , using a slow film and a flash attachment , Creer took a series of photographs-of newspaper headlines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York meeting of the Biological Photographic Association . The pictures were clear enough , considering the size of the film , but they were somewhat distorted because an eye lens is intended to focus on a curved surface , not on a flat film . <P> Creer wants to make clear that pigs , sheep and steers do not necessarily see what their eyes " saw " when they were used as cameras . The image on the retina is " assembled " in the brain into a visual image . No one knows what the brain of a pig may make of a comic strip .
