Photographer Robert Capa , who spoke five languages , was once asked which language he " thought " in . After mulling over the question , Capa answered : " I think in pictures . " Most of the pictures Capa thought in were of war . As a LIFE staffer in World War II , Capa earned a reputation as the best combat photographer in the world . Although he hated war ( " It is like an aging actress : more and more dangerous , and less and less photogenic " ) , Capa was seldom far from the front lines . Armed with three cameras and a flask of Scotch , he jumped with U.S paratroopers into Nazi-held Germany . At Anzio he landed with the assault troops ; on D-day he hit Omaha Beach with the first wave of the 1st Division . " For a war correspondent to miss an invasion , " Capa said jauntily , " is like refusing a date with Lana Turner after completing a five-year stretch in Sing Sing . " <P> The pictures Capa liked best were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his photo of an American machine gunner the instant he was killed , or his pictures of half-drowned G.I.s crawling through the heavy surf toward the Normandy beaches . Photographer Capa was no master technician ; under battle conditions his lighting and his focus were often faulty . He got his best pictures by knowing and understanding war , and by staying close to it . " If your pictures are n't good , " he was fond of saying , " you are n't close enough . " The late Brigadier General Teddy Roosevelt once said : " Bob knows more about the art of war than many four-star generals . " He also had a way with people and a flair for " getting around . " <P> Salons &; Saloons . Capa was born Andr Friedmann in Hungary . At 18 he went to Germany to study sociology , started to earn his way as a part-time photographer . When Hitler came to power , Capa skied across the border into Austria , then went to Paris , where he hit upon a unique scheme to sell his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as darkroom assistant for " a rich , talented American photographer named Robert Capa . " French newspapers and magazines were first impressed with the nonexistent Capa 's buildup . Then they were impressed with the pictures Andr Friedmann sold them . He did so well selling them that he changed his name to Capa , married Gerda Taro , his pretty assistant , and went off to Spain to cover the civil war . After his wife was crushed to death by a retreating Loyalist tank , Capa left Spain to photograph the war in China .
