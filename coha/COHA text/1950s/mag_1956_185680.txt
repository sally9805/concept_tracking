For a brief span of years in the 9th century , through a combination of armed might and wisdom , the Prankish King Charlemagne succeeded in establishing a measure of unity in war-torn Europe . Last week , 1,142 years after Charlemagne 's burial in Aix la-Chapelle ( the German city of Aachen ) , Sir Winston Churchill journeyed to Aachen to accept its Charlemagne Prize* for his own efforts to promote European understanding . <P> <P> At 81 , Britain 's great wartime leader looked a figure who already belongs to history . In contrast , Germany 's Chancellor Konrad Adenauer , only a year younger , seemed almost youthful as he bustled about , looking solicitously to the welfare of his guest . Rheumy-eyed and bowed with fatigue , Churchill , at Lady Churchill 's side , doggedly dragged his weight up the 23 steps into Aachen 's city hall , putting on a brave show for the 5,000 Germans gathered in the square to greet him . <P> The Old Fire . Once inside , however , there were 52 more steps to be negotiated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , the city fathers of Aachen had herded the 300 invited guests into the auditorium ahead of Sir Winston , then , discreetly sealing'the staircase from prying eyes , had the great guest carried up by four city firemen . <P> Facing a battery of microphones , Sir Winston managed to summon up a spark of the old fire , audaciously talked of making Russia a partner with NATO . His audience was more startled than inflamed . " A new question , " said Churchill , " has been raised by the recent Russian repudiation of Stalin . If it is sincere , we have a new Russia to deal with , and I do not see myself why the new Russia should not join in the spirit of this solemn agreement . In a true Unity of Europe , Russia must have her part . I was glad to see that Poland was already not unaffected by the changes in Russian outlook see below . It may be that other changes will follow ; Czechoslovakia may recover her freedom . Above all , Germany will be reunited . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attempt to solve the problem of European unity by any violent stroke . The only unity that might come might be a unity of ashes and death . " <P> " Equally , it would be fatal for NATO now to relax and let apathy overtake what has been achieved . " Nevertheless , in the long run , " our main theme of salvation should be the Grand Alliance of the European powers , linked with Canada and the U.S. The spirit of this arrangement should not exclude Russia and the Eastern European states . It may well be that the great issues which perplex us could then be solved more easily than they can by rival blocs confronting each other with suspicion and hostility . That is for the future . " <P> It is certainly no salvation for the present , said West Germany 's Foreign Minister Heinrich von Brentano next day . He and the Adenauer administration are having trouble enough to meet their minimum obligations to NATO in the prevailing apathy .
