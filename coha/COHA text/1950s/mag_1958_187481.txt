Trouble for iproniazid , the remarkable new anti-depression drug introduced last year ( TIME , Dec. 16 ) , was sparked last week by the death of a San Francisco woman whose physician prescribed it . A coroner 's jury ruled that her death ( of hepatitis ) was directly due to the drug , which is trade-named Marsilid by its maker , Hoffman-La Roche Inc. of Nutley . N.J. In January and February the drug house cut the recommended daily dosage for moderately depressed patients from 150 milligrams to a maximum of 50 . It tried to notify most practicing U.S. physicians , but the information never reached the woman 's doctor . Last week the company began renotifying some 145,000 physicians , and . by order of the Food and Drug Administration , will recall from druggists ' shelves all Marsilid packages bearing the old dosage label . <P> Smokers who can not break the habit may owe it all to mother , according to Harvard Psychologists Charles McArthur .

Those weaned at eight months were easily able to stop smoking ; those at six months still had a chance . But the most confirmed ( and heaviest ) smokers had taken to the bottle at four months , say the psychologists , too early to satisfy oral need and later keep them off the weed .
