" Certainly no people have ever had so much , and enjoyed so little real satisfaction . . . Can it be that our god of production has feet of clay ? Does industry need a new religion-or at least a better one than it has had ? " <P> These words came from no Sunday pulpiteer , but from the assistant to the president of the Standard Oil Co. of Ohio . Oliver Arthur Ohmann , 55 , writing in the current Harvard Business Review . Says Oilman Ohmann. who used to head the Department of Psychology at Western Reserve University 's Cleveland College : U.S. wage earners are uneasy , and the problem is not one of wages and hours , " as organized labor would have us believe . Raising the price of prostitution does not make it the equivalent of love . Is our industrial discontent not in fact the expression of a hunger for a work life that has meaning in terms of higher and more enduring spiritual values ? " What the modern worker needs , according to Presbyterian Ohmann , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe in ... that will give meaning to his job . " <P> The idea that a man should work hard and efficiently so that he can have more time and money to cultivate his soul is out-of-date . Now , " the job is the life . This is what must be made meaningful . . . What happens to people in the course of producing may be far more important than the end product . Materialism is not a satisfactory ' skyhook . ' " <P> How does the modern executive buckle up to his new responsibilities ? " He interprets or crystallizes the values and objectives for his group ... He integrates the smaller , selfish goals of individuals into larger , more social and spiritual objectives for the group . . . Conflicts are resolved by relating the immediate to the long-range and more enduring values . " Faced with this assignment of relating his product to his God , many a chewing gum manufacturer , comic-book publisher , movie distributor or banker might well fall to his knees . But , says Ohmann , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's founder , a good capitalist and good Baptist who took the long-range values for granted , might be somewhat puzzled by all the skyhook talk . John D. Rockefeller Sr. had put the matter more simply when he wrote : I was early taught to work as well as play ; <P> My life has been one long , happy holiday- <P> Full of work , and full of play- <P> I dropped the worry on the way- <P> And God was good to me every day .
