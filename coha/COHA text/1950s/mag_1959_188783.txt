South West Africa is a big ( 318,000 sq . mi. ) , largely treeless land that once belonged to imperial Germany and now has the unhappy distinction of being the last of the League of Nations mandates . Other such territories are either free or have been placed under U.N . trusteeship ; but the adjoining Union of South Africa goes blandly on ruling its old mandate as if it were a permanent province . <P> Only last month , having for the eighth time condemned the Union for its drastic racial policies , the U.N . General Assembly called on it to begin talks to put South West Africa under the U.N . The Union was piously proclaiming that it was just this kind of " interference " that was to blame for the bloody outbursts that had just been quelled in the South West Africa capital of Windhoek . <P> Spilled Beer . The Windhoek riot was the sixth major one to erupt in Union territory this year , and like all the others , it was the direct result of the whites ' measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles outside Windhoek , the government is completing a $5,000,000 " location " for the capital 's 16,000 blacks . Though the austere new houses are quite an improvement over the old tin shanties , they not only cost eleven times as much to rent , for people whose pay ranges from $3 to $10 a month , but are regarded by the blacks as nothing more than one more ignominious step toward complete apartheid . When the mandate 's administrator flatly refused even to receive a delegation from the location , the voteless blacks turned to the only weapon they had left-a boycott of the city-owned buses and beer halls . <P> As tension in Windhoek mounted , a beer-hall picket knocked over a can of malt beer that had just been bought by a woman customer . The woman called the police . Within minutes , police and an angry crowd of several thousand were scuffling . The blacks set the beer hall on fire , stormed the city jail , and freed all the prisoners . Some even dared the soldiers and police to shoot them , taunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The soldiers and police obliged : by the end of the day , twelve Africans had been shot to death . <P> Understanding . Anxious to place the blame elsewhere , the Union 's Minister for External Affairs Eric Louw declared that he had warned the U.N . all along that " incitement among nonwhites would give rise to disorder . " And just to make sure that the outside world would not be so misguided in the future , a group of South Africa 's richest men , headed by Sir Francis de Guingand , onetime Chief of Staff to Field Marshal Montgomery , and including Harry Oppenheimer , head of the De Beers diamond trust , announced that they were setting up a foundation devoted to promoting " international understanding of South Africa 's way of life , achievements and aspirations . " <P> Convinced that they already had a perfectly clear understanding of South Africa 's aspirations , nine African nations sent off a letter to U.N . Secretary Dag Hammarskjold protesting against the " shooting and killing " at Windhoek and sharply reminding the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international status . "
