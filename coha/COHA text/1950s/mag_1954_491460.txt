. NURSES ARE LUCK ' GIRLS ! By GEORGE SESSIONS PERRY . HEN , recently , after the usual delay I was finally admitted ton New Haven hospital , I discovered an odd fact . Though I knew others who were still waiting , I found on arrival that there were numerous beautiful , brand-new , unoccupied rooms . The fact was there were simply not enough nurses to take care of all the patients those rooms could hold . As my stay in the hospital extended first to weeks and then to months , this fact became more and more curious to me as , day after day , I saw before me the gaiety with which these young nurses went about their work . In the carefully demarcated caste system of hospital life , they were decidedly important persons . The management kowtowed to them . Their patients of all ages , with rare exceptions , adored them . The young doctors strove mightily in the sickroom , if perhaps less successfully in the halls , to keep from flirting with them . Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought would have disqualified them . were also guilty of a certain shy , mild flirtatiousness . The younger male patients , such as Yale students , were neither shy nor indirect . They were simply gaga about et least one nurse , and in various degrees of infatuation with most of the rest . What , I wondered , kept the bulk of America 's young female high-school graduates from stampeding into a sit uation such as this , where even a fairly attractive young nurse is today a kind of queen ? Plainly the working conditions were ideal . This spanking-new hospital had been designed to be not only fireproof but drudgery-prnof . It had been decorated so that the rooms were lighted by soft pastels and the corridors by sunshine colors . And if st could not be said that this up-to-the-minute hospital was representative of American hospitals of the past and pre. ? . lent , it was just as truly representative of the hospitals of the lot ure . While this repiirl may bring bitter Nolte from some : lunges Hull we here ore describing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Grace-New Haven have not been sufficient to attract a full staff of nurses . Indeed , theme nurses who scan their professional journals will recall this limpid al 's ail vert isernente which implore , " Are there any more at borne like you ? " Even so , beautiful living and working conditions , plus pmgressive ideas in nurses ' training and n disinclination to exploit the free labor of student nurses , have nuide the shortage of nurses and students far less acute here than in most places . Indeed , the rent significance of the Grace-New Haven setup is that it demonstrates what hospitals and nurses ' quarters can and should be if the shortage is not to become more desperate than it is . In any case , I meant to link carefully into the profession of nursing , as it was now being practiced , particularly on me , in this particular hospital . Was it any good , amt if so what was good about it ? I decided to start my inquiry at the bottom , which is to say with one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nursing  --  a " pinkie , " as these " preclinical " youngsters were called . This name derived from the color of their uniforms which for the first six months were to be a pleasant , restful pink , trimmed in while . And where bettor to start than with the pinkie to whom I was assigned as a patient ? to t he extent , that was , of the simple duties with which a pinkie nt first is trusted ? That pinkie was Miss Martha Wilson . aged eighteen . She came from ( Gmtiniseil on Pace 118 ) Just for inn , student nurse CarillY11 fir  --  ykenhohnn cheers 111 ) patient Luigi 11.114111illi atith a shave . EV EN I NC : MST Rowaytore Connecticut , and was an attractive , high-spirited brunette . She was almost always smiling . except on one occasion just after she 'd asked a patient if he wanted his teeth brushed , only to learn that he had n't any . At the other extreme , she 'd been walking on air the preceding morning because a doctor had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With the permission then of Miss Anna E. Ryle , director of nursing , I made what might be called a wheelchair date with Miss Wilson . I , twice her size , was to do the riding and she the pushing as I went with her on her morning 's activities , beginning at breakfast in the cafeteria where the student nurses are given their meals . Here in the cafeteria was a variety of the good things that are built into an American lirenkfaet . Yet when Miss Wilson went to get more coffee for us , I learned that no payment was necessary . " That 's one of the most lovable things about this old cafeteria , " Miss Wilson said fondly . " You can have seconds or , for that mat ler , even thirds . And that is very important , since student nurses are always ravenous . " But it was time now to set our wheel chair in motion , as we were due to be in class by eight o'clock . Soon , then , we were in the tunnel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student nurses , familiarly known as " Nightingale Haven , " in the basement of which the girls have their classrooms end laboratories , In psychology class , where we sat in chairs arranged amphitheater style , the talk was by no means limited to bow to quiet frantic patients or elevate the spirits of the depressed . Instead there was a symposium on how best to deal with a specific patient with a specific temperament , a specific clinical situation and set of prold  --  ms outside the hospital  --  ouch as family or money troubles . Different situations would be discussed on different days , but always specific cases , in order to impress on the students never to think of patients collectively but as individuals . From psychology chow we went to the nursing-arts laboratory , n large , low-ceilinged room done in pale green that contained , in effect , a twenty-bed hospital . Here charts were kept on mythical patients , just as they were on real ones in a real hospital . There were also dressing rooms where , when needed to serve as imital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniforms and into their pajamas before popping into tied . Then threw " patient " pinkies took their ease while their fellows , under the instruction of Mrs , Margaret Graham , made the beds an which they lay , received full " morning care , " including back rubs , and even got their hair shampooed in bed , which is quite a trick . And if you ever saw n perfect musical-comedy stage setting , this was it : Could you have raised a curtain on either side of the room , you 'd have seen ten green neck with cloud-white linens , beside which ten uniformed pinkies made identical moves as they tended ten gaily pik:ntied other pinkies . The drawee were interesting and the students unusually intent , since all of them knew darned well they must acquire in six months the game amount relinoury 20 , Nu of knowledge a college freshman more% up in nine . In checking over Mira Wilson 's academic schedule . I found that she had classes not only in the above . mentioned subjects but in anatomy , physiology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Miss Wilson and I left the nursing-arts lab , the door of the chemistry lab opened , and it was with something of a shock that I sawn score of pinkies pouring into the corridor , all in hrighl sweaters and skirts . It was the fine time I 'd seen them out of uniform rind minus their professional mien . NOY , they were just as attractive as , and wholly indistinguishable from , any group of college freshmen you might find anywhere in the country . Ordinarily , now that it was ter , o'clock , Miss Wilson would have gone " on the floor " in the hospital and administered to the needs of such as me . But since this morning was one of officially permitted exploration for us , I asked her to take me upstairs , so that I might see her new living quarters . As we came out into the lounge , with its glowing fireplace , its pale birch panels , its gold-and-walnut drapes , I got the feeling that we were entering a top-notch apartment hotel . Here Missi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervisor , who thereafter lent Miss Wilson a hand with the pushing and explaining . Next we encountered a number of small , cozy reception rooms called " Bernie Parlors , " done in French  --  provincial tfilcor , where girls might have some semblance of privacy with their dates and perhaps indulge , if there be such a thing , in at least intellectunt smooching . Hard by was the television lounge , and at the opposite end of the fine floor was the library . " Thin , " said Meet Wilson , " is where I do at least some studying almost every night . " Soon , then , we took the elevator sad went up to see Miss Wilson 's particular premises , which , like the 158 other roadie in the building , was entirely privote . It had a charming , built-in dresser , chest of drawers and bookcase made of birch . There was a big wardrobe on one aide , on the other a closet with shelves reaching to the ceiling . The bed was low enough to serve ns a couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture window , five feet wide and five feet tall . Beyond question this was one of the most charming dormitory rooms I 'd ever seen . Incidentally , it was identical with the new dormitory rooms just built for the girls at Mount Holyoke College . Mies Wilson 's room , brightened with pennants and a photograph of n Harvard freshman , lay but a short distance away from the bright red-and-yellow snack kitchen where at night the pajama-clad students make and devour sandwiches , hot chocolate , and so on . So far as Miss Wilson 's food , entirely becoming clothing and sumptuous shelter were concerned , neither she nor I could find grounds for complaint . As we started hack to the hospital , l pried a little into Miler Wilson 's social life . She was free , she said , each evening after dinner , which started at 6:30 and could be gulped by 6:00. until 10:30 in the evening . That meant that by taking a ten-minute walk , she in her companions could be seated tn downtown movie end enjoying their popcorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ally do , they attend a double feature , they can still get borne well before the 10:30 curfew . On week ends she could go home or spend Friday afternoon , Saturday and Sunday with one of the other girls and meet her family and friends . But oven on week ends when she stayed in New Haven , Miss Wilson managed to have a good time . Late passes could be had , and ordinarily she went to n football game or a dance with one of the Yale medical students . For not long after this class of pinkies had arrived , the juniors in the nursing school had given a big dance and arranged dates for all the pinkies . Since the medical students ate right in the cafeteria with the nursing students , acquaintances made on the dance floor naturally ripened into friendships in the cafeteria . But since at heart Miss Wilson is a kind of female Tom Sawyer , even on Sunday when there is no date she manages to corral a few hardy souls to go exploring through the countryside on rented hikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field trips that I find most interesting of /111 , " she said . The field trip that has made the greatest impression on Miss Wilson so far is the visit to the children 's hospital at Newington . Indeed , it put a new cast on her ambition for the future . Until then she had looked only four years ahead  --  first to finishing her three years of nursing education , and then spending a year as a nurse on a luxury cruise ship . The more she thinks about that year of cruising the oceans and seeing the strange , far cities of the world , the lees she can find wrong with it . But now she has begun to wonder if , after that happy year , she would n't like to continue her education for two more years and receive her B.S. degree . Then perhaps she could become a nursing specialist in the care of children , go right back to that children 's hospital at Newington , where nurses will probably be just as scarce as they are anywhere else , and participate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on these young and malleable patients . " So you think you 'd be good at handling kids ? " I asked . " Sure , " she said . " That 's the way I earned my spending money in high school  --  as a baby-sitter . " Well , unless babies and children in general were more peculiar than I thought they were , I saw no reason why they should n't respond to and love Miss Wilson , since , so far as I could see , everybody else did . My morning with Miss Wilson naturally made me recall n recent conversation I 'd had with a neighbor of mine who had graduated in nursing from an earlier Grace Hospital training achool . In her time , student nurses had had to set up and serve trays , scrub bathrooms and perform dozens of other not-strictly-nursing tasks which have long since been assigned to u variety of assistants . In her training days sheworked ten hours per day , six days a week , with only two hours off each evening . On Sunday , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , and had four hours off . Yet even though she had to put in exactly twenty-four more hoary per week than Miss Wilson does , she invariably recalls her nursing-school days as " the three grandest years of my life . " My date that afternoon , Miss Carolyn Kreykenbohm , wore a different-colored uniform  --  a soft . yet bright blue which made it plain that her pinkie days were over , but that she had yet to become a registered nurse . What 's more , 6110 sported a little cupcake cap of white , starched crinoline which rode square on top of her head . Yet , like Miss Wilson , this attractive , slender young lady would not have brought much if sold by the , pound . As it happened , I was her patient also . For where Miss Wilson would not , until her uniform turned blue almost six months hence , be permit ted to administer medication , give hypodermics or have possession of the key to the narcotics cabinet , Miss Kreykenhohm had already attained that state of grace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed or wheel chair , and had , moreover , spent the whole morning with Miss Wilson , the time had now come , as daily to all hospital patients it must , for me to have a bath . And whet better time for a talc-a-Lae than while we plashed about in the watihpan ? Now , much of what happened to Miss Kreykenbohm last year we already know from traipsing about with Mitts Wilson . But at present Miss Kreykenbohrn was in what L4 generally conceded to be the toughest part of a nursing course , her junior year , in which both academic and clinical experience are piled on thickest . Miss Kreykenbohm , incidentally , wasa very sweet little brunette with a retroutisi nose and a delightfully casual manner . I fell certain 1 that she never made even the most fractious patient nervous by her prience or manner , since her extraordinary poise came as naturally as breathing . As she scrubbed away , then , we talked about the business of nursing . She 'd come onto our floor only recently from a hitch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so short , it was her job to hand instruments In the ' surgeon . " Then , " she laid me , " came that awful morning . In the middle of an operation , we had to wait three minutes for a special instrument to be sterilized , while the patient lay gaping open on the table . At last I took the sterilized instrument out of the cooling pin , started to hand it to the surgeon and , horror of horrors , I dropped it on the floor . Then I had to stand there another whole three minutes waiting far the instrument to be sterilized again , while everybody stared at me , and the surgeon just stood there drumming on the patient 's chest with his fingeni ! " That , Miss Kreykenbohm felt sure , had been the very lowest moment in her career as a student nurse . I asked her if by now she 'd begun to be disillusioned and to feel that she 'd made a bad bargain . " Oh , no , " she said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , once you get into blue , you really become a pretty full-scale working part of the hospital . It needs and leans on us . Nowadays the students even have some say-so in running the nursing school . There are some students on the curriculum committee , and when we thought we needed more training 12o in how to care for polio cases , we got it Besides , " she continued , " at this stage of the game , there 's never a dull moment . As soon as we learn the ropes on one floor or department . which takes about a month , they shift us to another . " I asked her what she studied that the pinkies did n't . " Surgical nursing , operating-room technique , which is n't the same thing , medical nursing , more pharmacology , obstetric ; and pediatrics . And all of that tits perfectly into my future plans . I like this whole hospital scene so well that I think as soon as I finish my nursing training I 'll start studying medicine . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time you finish you 'll he too old to practice . " Site looked at me sharply . " I will not , " she said . " It 'll only take ten years in all . " That dropped me back on the pillows . " I 'm nineteen now , " she went on . " I 'll get almost two years of college credit for my nurse 's training . Besides , I 'll be about $1500 ahead . My whole nursing course , even including pocket money , will have cost only $500 , and I do n't believe I could possibly do two years of college for lei* , than $2000 . If , before I finished medical school , I fell in love and got married , which of course could happen , I 'd at least be a full-fledged something . I 'd be a registered nurse . Then , should anything ever happen to my husband , I could put on my uniform and tide our family over . But meanwhile Fm not counting on any of those things happening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , do n't call me ' Miss . ' call me ' Doctor . ' " Apparently nursing , these girls seem never to forget . is an avenue into every kind of allied field from public , industrial and military health work to 1w-coming an airplane hostess . Throw who wish to travel have complete assurance of getting a job anywhere in the United States . not to mention countless opportunities abroad . Nurse Mary Roberts Rinehart , of course , simply married a doctor and began writing novels . Yet most students aim directly at the job of nursing itself as a dignified , well-paid calling in which , so far as anybody now can see , their services will remain in perpetual demand . Where else , I wondered , could a woman past fifty be so completely free of the fear of unemployment ? Certainly the corridor outside my room was at that very minute cluttered with vintage belles who were serving as private-duty nurses . They were always in bubbling good spirits , sticking their noses in to pass the time of day or having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After Miss Kreykenbohm had me all bathed and powdered , my bed freshly made , Watt Point style , had made me comb my hair and shave , so that her Patient would be presentable , she popped off to address her next task , and I , with the agreeable languor that comes to persons after weeks or months in a hospital , fell peacefully asleep . It was almost two hours later when , without being called , I awoke to see standing over me that pleasantest of sights , a pretty hazel-eyed nurse , all bandbox fresh in a crisp white uniform , and smiling a lovely , warm smile that made me involuntarily , though half awake , smile back and say " Hello . " " I 've been in here five times , " she said , " to give you your pills . You really are very peaceful-looking , even innocent-looking , when you are asleep . " TILE sATu11111,11 ' " Thanks , " I said , and yawned . At that point , she dropped in two red pills and handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurses who worked on my floor , none was more genuinely loved , not merely by the patients but by that whole corps of employed and potentially jealous fertmlee ? maids , nurse 's aide , technicians , student nurses and registered nurses  --  theist this young lady , Mrs. Pearl Lipsky , R.N. Mrs. Lipsky had real stage presence . When she entered a room , there came with her a gentle freshness and coolness . She was also extremely pretty , kind , and the sort of person in whose presence a lot of ordinary things somehow became funny . " I 've been told , " I said , " that more nurses get married per capita than women in any other profession . " " They do , " Mrs. Lipsky said . " Lots of student nurses get permission to marry these days and later gel maternity leaves without any trouble . Ten years ago , if they got married , they got bounced out of school . " I asked Mrs. Lipsky if she 'd had much trouble with the young-men patients falling in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's nothing , " she said . " Even a dog ! owe ; you if you are good to him when he 's sick . " " And what about a young doctor ? When he 's working with an attractive nurse , is n't sheer propinquity , plus the adoration that most young nurses lavish on doctors , plus her ent husiale is interest in and understanding of his work  --  are n't these things enough ordinarily to make him /Hip the question ? " Mrs. Lipsky blushed and " ' ought for an answer . But luck was with her . She was saved by the bell  --  or rather a call to the nursing station . It would have been inappropriate for Mrs. Lipsky to say she did n't know . For what made her testimony on these crucial mutters of the heart especially important was the fact that she had done what virtually all young nurses dream of doing . Only a few months earlier , this talented but demure young lady had walked down the aisle and said her " I do 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly had Nurse Lipsky left my room when Miss Elizabeth Bemis , a tall , slender , blond lass who was the head nurse in my part of the hospital , dropped in and offered to Lake me on a personally conducted tour of what the hospital calls its " nurse savers , " which is to say its new work-eliminating gadgets . I accepted eagerly EVENINI : lti'l* and was , what 's more , flattered , since as the head of our entire floor , Miss Bemis was a big shot . She was living proof not only that young nurses can get important executive jobs but that in reality it is the nurses who run hospitals . Directors and doctors may make the policy and the speeches , but it is the executive nurses , like Mime Bemis , who actually keep things rolling smoothly . Incidentally , Miss Bemis was one of the many nurses and students who 'd got a running start in their nursing training by working week ends as nurse 's aids while still in high school . We wheel-chaired directly to the nursing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that the nurses here can see each person who enters or leaves any room on the floor . But it is the two-way intercommunication system running from this station to every patient 's bedside on the floor that saves the nurses literally miles of walking . In the old days , when a patient wanted a glass of water , he pressed his buzzer and the nurse made four trips  --  first , to find what was wanted ; second , to get the water ; third . to deliver it ; and finally , to return to her station . She now merely asks , " What can I do for you ? " , learns that the patient 's water pitcher is empty and dispatches a nurse 's aid on the errand . The nursing stations are also served by pneumatic tubes , which save trips to the pharmacy for pills , the laboratories for reports , and so on . But even better is a nearby utility room which contains one of the greatest step and work savers of all  --  the automatic dumb-waiter . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are received , not only hoists the stuff upstairs but also , without any human assistance , unloads itself and starts on another errand . And just so the nursee will be in the know , it informs them of its doings by light and buzzer . The fact that each patient 's room line its own lavatory and toilet saves countless other steps . Each room also has a Vacuum outlet , handy for pumping out the patients when they need it , and even more important , an oxygen outlet . Mists Bernet still vividly recalls the old method of administering oxygen when the nun. * or somebody first hauled in a heavy oxygen cylinder , tied it to the patient 's bed , then " cracked " the valve with a wrench . Now , when this valve was inadvertently opened too wide , the huge metal flask became , in effect , a jet-propelled torpedo which on occasion tore itself loose from the ledpoet and went zizzFrlornury ' 20 , 041 ing dangerously about the hospital like u high-lifed thing while doctors , nurses and technicians dived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can all be glad need pursue Miss Bemis no farther . " About the only thing here that has not been modernized , " Miss Bemis pointed out , " is the patients . And the fact that the nurses Still have to mike the beds every day . " By now we were back in my room , where Mrs. Lipsky and Mrs. Evelyn Madigan were straightening mine . " Why , I would n't dream of letting anybody make up my beds , " Mrs , Madigan declared . ' that 's the only time I have really to find out how my patient 's feeling  --  up , down , or so-se , When I 've finished making that bed , I know . " Soon Miss Eunice Gordon , night supervisor for the fifth , sixth and seventh floors , came in to chat a moment . I always loved for Miss Gordon to drop in , not only because she was so pretty but because of her tales about nursing both out of and in the Air Force . Soon Mts . Doris Tharp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those nurses had had most experience in obstetrical work , the talk drifted to that subject , and I found out something I 'd never have suspected . Though , in all , these women had probably been present at 1000 deliveries and would , I 'd supposed , regard each new infant as a highly humdrum addition to the census , that was not the case at all . Each told of the strange sense of exaltation that possessed her with the arrival of each new baby as if she were somehow part of a real and tremendously exciting miracle . " I do n't care if I attend fifty million more deliveries , " Mrs. Madigan declared , " I 'll always feel the same way . " Then , more casually , they got to talking of how rewarding it was to see a patient gain and glow in health , of the little things they liked to do to make pi-Went-4 more comfortable . And as they talked , I wondered if , in their profession , the natural , human instinct to give a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it kept their psyches in tone and singing . In any ease , these veteran nurses were talking about their jobs with as much excitement and enthusiasm as if they were pinkies . I recalled a comment Mrs. Graham had made earlier in the day . In speaking of the pinkies ' real zeal to serve and their almost luminous kindness to the patients . she pointed out how these qualities often grew dim during the student nurses ' senior year , when they became immersed in routine , the beginnings of professionalism and the intoxication of living in one 's own twenties . At this period they were more skilled and just as attractive as ever . Yet it was often five or eight or ten years after graduation that the real and ennobling sense of mission returned to give new meaning , satisfaction and bloom to a nurse 's career . Each of the many mature nurses I questioned on this point agreed that it was e.o . There in the soft light , 1 looked at Miss Gordon 's face , agleam with gentleness and strength , generosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face that Americans had visualized as The Rose of No Man 's Land ? the Red Cross nurse back in iiVorld War I. In another role , I thought , that face might have been different . For surely an essential quality of its loveliness reflected n life devoted to a lofty profession .
