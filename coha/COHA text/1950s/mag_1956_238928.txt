After the House of Commons voted to outlaw the death penalty , Britain 's Chief Hangman Albert Pierrepoint , 45 , quit the job that has been in his family for 85 years and turned his strong , steady hand to his memoirs . Fleet Street , which has spiced many a grey Sunday with the death-cell memoirs of murder ers , bid eagerly for the chance to take their readers right into the execution chamber . The winner : Lord Kemsley 's Sunday Empire News ( circ. 1,961,230 ) , which paid a reported 40,000 ( $112,000 ) for Pierrepoint 's own story of how , in 26 years , he took 433 men and 17 women to the gallows . <P> The hangman 's memoirs brightened the Sabbath with intimate glimpses of the killers about to die ( " He blinked bewilderedly , screwing up his eyes " ) and craftsmanlike pride in his humane efficiency ( " I hanged John Reginald Christie , the Monster of Rillington Place , in less time than it took the ash to fall off a cigar I had left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an execution ( fee : $42 ) , Pierrepoint would go back to his cigar and his regular job ( pubkeeper ) . <P> The Empire News series was such a coup in sensation-hungry Fleet Street that the Sunday Dispatch tried to run neck and neck by publishing installments from the diary of a second-string hangman named William Willis . But Pierrepoint was so far out ahead that the Dispatch had to fall back on a new serial called " Liana-the Blonde from the Jungle . " <P> Then the shadow of the Home Office fell between Pierrepoint and his readers . The government , which still supports the death penalty , felt that the memoirs made grisly grist for foes of capital punishment , who are now pushing their bill in the House of Lords . Under the Official Secrets Act , the Home Office demanded the right to censor the stories . When the paper defied the censorship in one installment , the government threatened to prosecute at the next violation . <P> The Empire News waved the banner of " freedom of the press , " and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act , if used against Pierrepoint , should not be applied to Sir Winston Churchill for publishing some of the " closest secrets of the war . " Gamely , the Empire News carried on with the series , though " deleting . . . those passages which seem to arise from knowledge gained by Mr. Pierrepoint in the course of his official duties . " That left Pierrepoint little of the noose fit to print . This week Pierrepoint reached the end of his rope . Announced the Empire News : " In view of the difficulties ... it has been decided to cancel the series . "
