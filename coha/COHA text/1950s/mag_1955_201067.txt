The Georgia board of education decided to backtrack on its widely criticized resolutions to " revoke forever " the license of any teacher who approves of mixed classes or is a member of the N.A.A.C.P. Instead , it demanded that all teachers take the annual teachers ' oath to uphold the state constitution ( including its segregation provisions ) and " to refrain from directly or indirectly subscribing to or teaching any theory of government or of social relations which is inconsistent with the fundamental principles of patriotism and high ideals of Americanism . " If the board enforces its own ideals of Americanism , the new resolution will have much the same effect as the old . <P> The Norfolk ( Va. ) city council approved a new plan for getting around the U.S. Supreme Court 's order to end school segregation . Henceforth , Norfolk will have three types of schools-all-white , all-Negro , and mixed . Parents can take their choice .
