Once a temporary cease-fire line was agreed upon , the negotiators in the tent at Panmunjom went on to harder matters . They sank their teeth into the " tough gristle of Item 3 , which concerns supervision of the armistice after it is signed . Meanwhile , the 30-day trial period , which expires Dec. 27 , started ticking away . <P> Everyone knew that Item 3 would be difficult . Key point of the U.N . proposal was that joint U.N.-Communist observation teams should be given access to all parts of Korea . Key point of the Communist proposal was that a joint armistice commission should be set up with , apparently , no authority to inspect anything but the 2-mile buffer zone between the armies . A deadlock immediately ensued . Vice Admiral Charles Turner Joy rejected the Red scheme as toothless . Lieut . General Nam II , the deadpan North Korean commander , rejected the U.N . plan as a " brazen interference " with the internal affairs of North Korea . <P> Chilly Language . As the argument over Item 3 wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new problems and extraneous issues cropped up . Admiral Joy beefed up his inspection proposal by suggesting that air patrols as well as ground teams should be provided for . The Reds demanded the right not only to repair existing airfields in North Korea , but to construct new ones during the armistice period . Their argument : " wanton bombing " by the U.N . had deprived them of adequate air defenses . In spite of two roaring stoves in the conference tent , the air was chilly with frigid language and stale with monotonous repetition . Admiral Joy said that U.N . forces were willing to be inspected , and asked a simple question of the Communists : " What do you plan to hide ? " <P> Red About-Face . Just when the Reds appeared most stubborn , they performed a dramatic about-face . They accepted the principle of inspection and of a military " freeze " of existing forces . They proposed that : 1 ) neither side should introduce into Korea " any military forces , weapons and ammunition under any pretext during an armistice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " neutral " countries should inspect " ports of entry in the rear as mutually agreed upon . " <P> At first blush , this seemed to come close to meeting U.N . demands , and looked like an even bigger concession than the Communist abandonment of the 38th parallel . If the Reds meant what they said , it would be the first time in any postwar negotiations that an Iron Curtain country has been willing to let outsiders in for a look around . Cautiously pleased but wary of booby traps , Joy 's team prepared a list of 21 questions which they wanted the Reds to answer . For example , just what countries would the Communists consider neutral . Nam II promised a prompt answer .
