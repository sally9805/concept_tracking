Not for a long while had Broadway had a more prosperous or pleasing season . At times , during 1955-56 , even the more contained critics chose their words like poets - or like pressagents . Where , all too often in years gone by , the jejune was bustin ' out all over , this season had a great deal of flavor , and a fair amount of body as well . Even so late as April , when playwriting usually sports its lightest-weight and most ill-fitting clothes , plays still looked neat or showed substance . <P> <P> AAA to EEE . Merit , on Broadway , came in most sizes and shapes . In My Fair Lady , music had charms to please the most civilized breast ; gilding Pygmalion , My Fair Lady made a dazzling Mayfair lady of Shaw 's guttersnipe . The season 's comedies had everything from the faint fine laughter of the eyes to sheer guffawing rock and roll . There was rewarding drama as well as melodrama , and in The Diary of Anne Frank , which won seven awards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound sentiment . <P> Most works with any real distinction possessed foreign blood . The season 's most creative new play was British Writer Enid Bagnold 's witty , elegantly savage The Chalk Garden . Even more finely tempered was Tiger at the Gates , Jean Giraudoux 's humanely ironic lament for the Trojan and all subsequent wars . Audiences might argue whether Samuel Beckett 's puzzling , plotless Waiting for Godot was profound art or a mere philosophic quiz show ; less arguable was the neatness of its writing , the desolation of its mood . In Lillian Hellman 's sharp adaptation , Jean Anouilh 's The Lark proved a lively stage piece ; under Tyrone Guthrie 's vivid direction , Marlowe 's Tamburlaine the Great , if still no play , was rich in theater , spectacle , rhetoric . <P> Made in U.S.A. Native playwriting was solid too , but at a less lustrous level and in less creative guise . Much , instead of being directly created for the stage , was made over from something else , whether in such clear successes as The Diary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heart , or such interesting failures as Mister Johnson and The Young and Beautiful . At straight playwriting , Arthur Miller came closest to real achievement with A View from the Bridge , but he let a longing for Greek tragedy blur the play 's kinship with primitivist drama . <P> The honor roll for acting was almost tiresomely long : beyond established names like Bert Lahr , Ruth Gordon , Rex Harrison , Joseph Schildkraut , Shirley Booth , there were young or foreign ones like Julie Andrews , Andy Griffith , Earle Hyman , Siobhan McKenna . It was the season when , thanks to Comedienne Nancy Walker , Noel Coward 's generation-old Fallen Angels was restored to life without having previously ever lived , when Orson Welles played King Lear in a wheelchair , and when Susan Strasberg , in the title role of Anne Frank , was raised to stardom at 17.
