You have undoubtedly noticed that full-color pages in TIME 'S editorial sections-which once appeared as infrequent " extra dividends " - have now become a regular feature in the magazine . <P> A year ago , Executive Editor Dana Tasker was put in charge of a special project to use color in TIME whenever it helps tell a story better than black-and-white illustration . I think you will agree that color pictures often do add another dimension of understanding to news reporting . <P> Paintings and art work of all kinds were natural candidates for color treatment , and have been reproduced in TIME 'S Art section in every issue since May 28 , 1951 . TIME has also developed a special type of story in which color pictures have played a major part-reports on areas of the world that have become important in the news . Some which you probably remember were those on the British Isles ( TIME , July 2 ) , the Moslem World ( Aug. 13 ) , Alberta ( Sept. 24 ) , the Industrial South ( Dec. 10 ) , Hawaii ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Perhaps the really unique feature in this part of TIME 'S color program has been the maps drawn by Robert Chapin . I think you will feel , as I do , that color has given Chapin 's maps-one of TIME 'S hallmarks for many years-an even greater degree of clarity . <P> A byproduct of TIME 'S color program has been the emergence of Cover Artist Boris Artzybasheff as a color photographer . A good journalist , as well as an imaginative artist , Artzybasheff made the color photographs of booming Alberta and lonely San Salvador ( TIME , Oct. 15 ) . Associate Editor John T. McCullough . who was once a news photographer and is now TIME 'S color picture editor , has also used his camera to advantage for color supplements on Old Sturbridge Village ( TIME , Nov. 5 ) , Hawaii , and , in this issue , Lexington , Ky . <P> The color pages in TIME 'S Art section during the past year have ranged all the way from the work of old masters to that of the most brash of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the new work of contemporary painters , conservative as well as the most radical experimenters . Those of you who have been collecting TIME 'S Art color pages now have a gallery of reproductions that includes the work of Toulouse-Lautrec , John Sloan , Andrew Wyeth , El Greco , Vincent Van Gogh , John Marin , Wassily Kandinsky , Willem de Kooning , Jackson Pollock , Paul Cezanne , Paolo Veronese and Leonardo da Vinci . In addition , the color pages have provided the opportunity to show a wide range of other art forms : from modern church architecture to flower arrangements , from Indian sand painting to luminous sculpture , from 20th century fireworks to Ming ceramics . <P> To test the simple hypothesis behind TIME 'S art color program - i.e. , that since paintings are painted in color , it is better reporting to show them that way - look at the black-and-white reproduction of Paul Gauguin 's Tahitian Landscape shown here , then turn to the Art section and compare it with the same picture in color . <P> Cordially yours ,   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
