 | What We 're Learning About Tornados LAST year was the worst tornado year on record . This year could be even worse . To quote one weather man : " If the trend continues , 1958 could be a blockbuster . " Until 1951 an average of 150 twisters per year were reported to the U. S. Weather Bureau . In 1951 there were 300 . In the next three years the number skyrocketed . There were 690 in 1954 . In 1955 , 870 ; last year , nearly a thousand . To top this off , our big cities and their sprawling suburbs are being hammered : Dallas , Worcester , Flint , Kansas City , Fargo are examples . On some recent days twisters have come at a fantastic rate . As many as 28 have been officially reported in a single day . In Texas last April 3 , 58 tornadoes were unofficially reported . " They 're coming so fast and thick , " one watcher moaned , " that we 've lost count . " Some experts blame the tornado boom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about twisters are true . This happened in Ionia , Iowa , on April 23 , 1948 . Tornadoes hit more often now , yet kill fewer people . Radar gets a big share of the credit ris Tepper , the Weather Bureau 's expert on tornado research , says : " There are many more people today to sec and get in the way of ? tornadoes . The tornado that rolled harmlessly through a field 10 years ago today rolls through a shopping center . " Anyway , the fact remains : More towns and more people are getting hit . Against this bleak background are two bright spots : 1 . The Weather Bureau is fighting back . Soon it hopes to launch a " severestorm laboratory " project that could lead to tornado control . 2 . Fewer people are killed in spite of the sevenfold increase in twisters . Until 1951 deaths averaged about 225 a year ? three deaths for every two tornadoes . But between 1951 and 1956 the death rate dropped to about 175 a year ? one death in three tornadoes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's alert young Severe Weather Warning Service . In five years this service has saved , conservatively , 2,000 lives . Helping the Weather Bureau are thousands of volunteer observers and dozens of college scientists . A tornado disaster today is treated like an air crash . Just as CAB inspectors swarm over a smashed plane . weather-research teams now swarm into tornado areas , examining bits of wreckage , interviewing witnesses . Along with this , Weather Bureau observers are closing in on tornadoes . A few seasons ago observers were often 200 or300 miles apart . Today competent volunteers may be stationed , with instruments , every 20 or 30 miles . The facts . Here are some of the things we now know about twisters : ? They come usually from southwest or west ; occasionally from the northwest . ? They breed when a warm , sticky south wind has been blowing for several hours ? but a cold front is charging down from the northwest . Usually there 's a thunderstorm , too . ? They mostly show up between three and seven p. m. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike in any month . Winter tornadoes usually are limited to the Gulf states . In March they migrate north with spring . After July , they suddenly begin to quiet down . ? Tornado Alley stretches from Texas to Minnesota . Another path chops all across Dixie . Mountain areas and the West Coast are fairly immune . ? Some twisters are vicious , travel 300 miles or more , smashing town after town . Others give up after a few minutes ' whirl . The tricks that twisters play are part of American folklore . A farmer will swear that tornadoes follow roads and ditches . Some weather men think that this may be coincidence . Still , one recent twister actually appeared to change course to follow a road for a half-mile . One may roar toward a house and suck denly leapfrog over it , leaving no more damage than a few bricks loosened in the chimney . Last year one charged down a driveway toward a farmhouse , turned and went around it before resuming course . just as if there had been a " Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in gangs . as many as six funnels jumping up and down at once . ( If you 're ever near a twister , keep a sharp eye out for its " sister " ? another main funnel which can develop on one side . ) Anatomy- of a twister . At the ground a funnel may be a giant whirlwind a mile wide or just a good-sized vacuum-cleaner nozzle ? nine or 10 feet across . Usually it 's 200 to 300 yards wide . Some appear to " hunt , " as an elephant 's trunk probes for peanuts . Air pressure inside the fun-@#  | nel is very low , which is why tornadostruck buildings burst outward . Suppose a funnel passes close to you . What do you hear and see ? The sound , as everyone knows who 's ever been close to one , is like a fast freight train or a hundred airplanes . On a quiet day you may hear another sound smashing timber . A slashing wind may bend the trees , and horizontal brown rain ( stained by mud being whirled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there 's no rain you may have a pretty good view of the breath-taking gray funnel . If the twister comes in a thunderstorm you may see endless flashes of lightning . This intense phenomenon is , in fact , one way scientists now study the funnels . Special " sferics " instruments now spot such lightning outbursts and follow tornadoes by triangulation from as far as 200 miles away . How fast do they whirl ? Recent studies find no evidence of winds faster than 200 m. p. h . Forward speed averages 16 to 20 m. p. h . But some twisters move at turnpike speeds of 60 m. p. h. , and one hotrod was clocked , unofficially , at 138 . There are also slowpoke twisters that creep at walking speed , and one last year even stopped long enough to chew a hole in the ground with spinning wreckage . If you ever see a tornado that seems to stand still , duck . Chances are it 's heading straight for you . The best defense : early warning . Your greatest protection against tornadoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today the Weather Bureau has radar at offices and airports in many states . In Tornado Alley some towns own and man their own radars . But lately another device has come into wide use : the pressure-jump detector . Weather men have discovered curious lines of pressure that skid eastward ahead of a cold front . In some cases tornadoes form near those lines . You can do some detecting by observing your own living-room barometer . Suddenly , after hours of rain , the instrument  | will kick up a notch and you 'll hear a peal of thunder . That 's a pressure jump . Now the Weather Bureau has special detectors installed in dozens of farms . and in police and fire stations . These sound a buzzer and flash a light when barometric pressure suddenly rises ? and this sends a volunteer observer to the phone to notify the nearest Bureau . When a " jump line " is moving , the radar operators watch their scopes for the curious button-hook-shaped blips that may mean tornadoes . What makes a tornado ? Scientists now think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some vast force pulling through the atmosphere ( as a spinning propeller , suddenly revved up ? or revved down ? pulls up little dust devils when a plane warms up ) . This pulling force could be one of the narrow jet streams ? high-altitude winds that zip eastward across America at speeds of 100 m. p. h. or more . But this does n't explain another puzzler . Anyone who has seen a weather map knows about " highs " and " lows , " their centers several hundred miles apart . But now weather sleuths have discovered strange little highs and lows that can form side-by-side almost within a goodsized farm . These curious " micro lows " look like mere dimples on a weather map . But they can be deadly when they form in twister weather . For out of these innocent-looking micro lows may come tornadoes . Tornado control ? If twisters come out of strange little disturbances only a few miles across , it seems reasonable to expect that cloud-seeding or some similar technique can prevent them . Meteorologists hope Congress will okay S5,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ground observers 30 miles apart , the meteorologists want to station men and instruments only 10 miles apart in the busiest parts of Tornado ? Alley . These men would take readings ? on every foot of a tornado ? beginning ? hours before it is born . And when the funnel forms , five or six planes would buzz around it even over it to take radar photos down the funnel . From this kind of massive study the Weather Bureau thinks it can , in five years , learn what tornadoes really arc and then , how to stop them .
