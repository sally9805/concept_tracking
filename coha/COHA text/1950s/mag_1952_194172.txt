As even the proudest Southerner knew , post-graduate education in the South , particularly in professional fields , was in a sorry state . Florida had neither dental , medical nor veterinary schools ; facilities in most other states were hopelessly inadequate . What could be done to bring the South up to par ? <P> At their annual meeting in 1948 , nine Dixie governors agreed on a simple answer : they would share each other 's campuses . They set up a council , opened headquarters in Atlanta , went into operation in 1949 . By last week , the Southern Regional Education Board had become the biggest boon that Southern education has ever known - " the greatest bargain , " says Florida 's Fuller Warren , " since manna fell on the children of Israel . " <P> Peaks of Excellence . Under its young ( 33 ) director , Sociologist John E. Ivey Jr. , the program has invaded every aspect of higher education . Today , 14 states belong to it , and each year hundreds of students who can not get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for help . If the board accepts a student , it can assign him to a school in another state . The student 's home legislature foots the bill : $1,500 a year for medical and dental students , $1,000 for veterinarians , $750 for nurses and social workers . <P> This fall , the board will assign more than 1,000 students , send more than $1,000,000 in extra fees to various institutions . But that is only a fraction of its work . In three years , the board has become not only a vast student clearinghouse , but also a planning agency that is rapidly turning Southern campuses into one prosperous university . <P> College and university presidents are beginning to learn that they no longer have to spread their budgets thin over dozens of different departments . With the board 's help , they can now specialize ( " We are building complementary peaks of excellence , " says Ivey ) . Instead of diluting specialities by trying to duplicate those of other campuses , each school can go right on improving what it has : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one place to earn a degree . <P> Isolationist Colleges . The board has also persuaded the Air Force to set up a $40,000 scholarship program for the Air University at Maxwell Field . Largely through the board 's contacts with the Federal Government , the South now gets 14% of all research contracts ( seven years ago it got 5% ) . <P> This year , the board is laying plans to reach out into such fields as city planning , hospital management , marine science , forestry , foreign affairs . It is considering a faculty exchange program and a combined library service . If all goes according to plan , says Ivey , the South 's colleges and universities will eventually become a sort of education NATO : " There is nothing more isolationist than our colleges , and there is no greater barrier to sound development than the generally accepted notion of institutional sovereignty .
