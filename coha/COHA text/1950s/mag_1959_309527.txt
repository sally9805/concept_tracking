Robert B. McNeill was on the way through law school at the University of Alabama when he switched to Richmond 's Union Theological Seminary . But for Alabama-born Seminarian McNeill , the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth had separate entrances marked WHITE and COLORED ; as a member of the basketball team he refused to play against Richmond 's Negro College , Virginia Union , and at an inter-seminary conference he balked at sitting down to lunch with the Negro delegates . <P> But he did sit down with them and thereafter began an intensive study of race relations , which he kept up at the First Presbyterian Church of Columbus , Ga. , where he went 6 years ago . In 1957 and 1958 he was chosen to draft the Southern Presbyterian reports on race , and they were noted as the most liberal statements on the subject to have been issued by a predominantly Southern denomination . <P> Imperative Demand . Two years ago , McNeill upset some 50 members of his influential , 1,200-member First Presbyterian Church by writing a magazine article calling for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " representation of both groups on city councils , grand juries , school boards , medical societies , ministerial associations and other public agencies . " Fortnight ago , he wrote a note in the church bulletin urging parishioners to read without prejudgment an article by a Columbus newspaperman saying how much better the racial situation had become in Columbus . <P> Last week , after 44-year-old Presbyterian McNeill had finished his Sunday sermon , the Rev. Frank C. King of Valdosta , Ga . rose to read the decision of a commission appointed by the Presbytery of Southwest Georgia to study reports of dissension within Pastor McNeill 's church . The decision : Robert McNeill must go : " The interests of religion imperatively demand it . " <P> Emotional Flames . The congregation was stunned . Some women in the choir burst into tears . Several parishioners rose from their pews to denounce Commissioner King . " You have been listening to the wrong people , " said one . " If we kick a Christian man and his family out like this , what hope have we ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Said he , with notable irrelevance : " The commission feels that the voice of the pulpit should be the voice of the congregation . " <P> At the evening service , the real voice of the congregation was still heard : parishioners wept again as they heard Bob McNeill preach a blistering farewell sermon . " We in the South can no longer speak in terms of democracy or justice without making a parenthetical exception for an entire people . When we make this exception time after time in everything we do , we have lost the capacity to reason logically . I have grown to despise a particular word . That word is ' compromise . ' Have you noticed how everybody is a moderate these days ? Everybody is rushing toward the middle ground . We 'll have to revise our terminology now . We 'll have to refer to left moderates , right moderates and middle moderates . This type of so-called moderate will be caught up and squeezed in the very middle he has created for himself .
