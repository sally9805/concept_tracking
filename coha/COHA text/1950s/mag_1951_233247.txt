Like the birds , vacationers fly south in the winter and north in the summer . No one follows their flight more closely than National Airlines President George T. Baker . His passenger traffic reaches a peak in winter on its main-line run from New York to Miami , but it slumps during the summer . Last week Baker made a deal to give National a big payload the year round and move it up from tenth to eighth largest U.S. airline . ( It ranks an estimated fifth in net operating income among domestic airlines . ) National will buy Colonial Airlines for $7 million worth of stock ( ? of a share of National to be exchanged for one share of Colonial ) , subject to approval by CAB and the stockholders of both lines . <P> Colonial 's biggest business is in summer over its northern routes ( see map ) . By merging , the lines would feed passengers into each other all the way from Havana , Cuba , equalize year-round traffic . CAB will probably approve the deal since it has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of its troubles . In 1951 , Colonial pulled out of the red for the first time in five years with the help of a $13-per-ton-mile payment for carrying air mail v. 54 per ton mile to National operating on more profitable mail routes . It had still other troubles . Last summer , CAB charged Colonial President Sigmund Janas with 40 violations of its rules ( TIME , July 2 ) . Janas resigned , was charged in Canada with illegal currency speculation and by New York 's U.S. Attorney of falsifying records of $69,000 in Colonial funds . <P> But Baker thought he could afford to take over Colonial-troubles and all-to get its air routes . After a six months ' strike of his pilots almost forced National out of business in 1948 , Baker pulled the line out . Last year , National turned in a profit of $548,000 . In the year ending June 1951 , Baker boosted the profit to a record $2.6 million .
