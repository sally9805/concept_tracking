Today 81 years after his death , detractors of Berlioz still scorn him as a crude noisemaker who marshaled whole regiments of instruments and singers to gain his fantastically emotional effects , although most of them will grudgingly admit that he contributed some new colors to the palette of orchestration . His fervent admirers , even those who are troubled at the ease with which he passes from the sublime to the banal , claim that Berlioz was one of the giants of the romantic period-a composer who caught the heart beat of Beethoven , and went on to develop his own huge and powerful " narrative " ( Symphonie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Columbia University Professor Jacques Barzun is an earnest and erudite man who inclines with all his heart toward the second view .

He was continually in &; out of love , twice halfheartedly attempted suicide to prove his devotion . His punishment for one clumsy attempt at sea , Hector told a friend , was " to swallow a lot of salt water and be yanked out like a fish . . . " He was married twice , both times unhappily ; his only son Louis became a sailor , died two years before his famous father . <P> " I Am Going .
