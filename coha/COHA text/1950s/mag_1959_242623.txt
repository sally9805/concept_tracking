Late each afternoon , villagers of tiny Beutelsbach ( pop . 900 ) , in Germany 's Rems valley climb the twisting road to the hedge-bound estate of Landgut Burg . Their hosts , American undergraduates studying at Stanford University 's experimental overseas branch , serve coffee and kuchen , talk exuberantly in often sprained , sometimes fractured , German . Last week Beutelsbachers were greeting a new batch of Stanford students , the second to arrive in Germany since the 30-acre campus was opened last summer . <P> The university 's overseas base , twelve miles from Stuttgart , is a rarity-other American colleges and universities let their undergraduates study abroad , but - few have foreign campuses-and Stanford is well pleased with the project . Because classes in such subjects as political science , art history and philosophy are conducted by Stanford professors in English , admission to Landgut Burg is not restricted to language majors and the few other students able to speak German-usually a limitation of the year-abroad programs run by other U.S. institutions . <P> Liebesfreiheit . All students get intensive language instruction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amiable Beutelsbachers . The results are impressive , although not perfect - on one dining hall poster , " love of freedom ' ' ( Freiheitsliebe ) came out Lie-besfreiheit-free love . <P> Europe itself is the subject most painstakingly studied . Field trips-to Rome for art and architecture , to Berlin for political science-fill in the outlines of classroom lectures . Three-day weekends during the summer and fall allow long freelance forays . " There was . " according to one report , " a definite trend to Lederhosen " Wrote Friedrich W. Strothmann , head of Stanford 's modern languages department and , with General Studies Chairman Robert A. Walker , originator of the Landgut Burg school : the students typically " hop on a motorcycle Thursday afternoon and come back Sunday from Venice and Salzburg after having seen a Mozart opera , a puppet play , an Everyman performance , on merely a piece of cheese and a little spaghetti . Faced with the choice between either a good meal or another tankful of gasoline and an opera ticket , they invariably renounce the meal - as they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss no meals , although they may eat plain Bratwurst or Sptzle . Plainness in food is more than made up for by the low cost of the six months abroad . The university charges only about $1,000-the amount it collects for a boarding semester at Stanford-for plane fare to Germany , board , room and tuition . Thoughtfully , Stanford officials made no provision for return flights to the U.S. Best evidence of Landgut Burg 's success : the university is seriously considering a similar outpost in Florence , has in the back of its mind a Stanford-in-France and a Stanford-in-Mexico.
