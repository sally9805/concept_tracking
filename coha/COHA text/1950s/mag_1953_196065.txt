All week long , anti-Communist North Korean and Chinese prisoners who had refused repatriation were herded into the muddy-red , hilltop compounds of " Indian Village " in Korea 's neutral zone . As each new batch arrived , Communist officers and " newsmen " crowded in close to the fences to listen while neutral Indian army guards called the roll . Each time they caught a name , the Red observers glared ominously and scribbled it down in note pads with exaggerated gestures . <P> The incoming prisoners reacted to this clear attempt at intimidation with a mixture of fear and defiance . Many of them refused to answer the roll , tore off their Manila name tags and kept their fists tightly clenched to forestall fingerprinting . Gradually they grew more bellicose . Compounds bristled with South Korean and Chinese Nationalist flags . Barrages of stones and curses descended on glum-faced Communist observers . <P> Faced with repeated near-riots , Major General Shankar Pandurang Patil Thorat , commander of the 5,000-man Indian guard force , hastily cabled New Delhi for reinforcements . He ordered the Communists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire . " Just a little more than a stone 's throw , " smiled an officer . <P> This week , with only a fraction of the 23,000 non-repatriates still to arrive , the tumult in Indian Village began to subside . Sandhurst-trained General Thorat and his troops-the pick of India 's professional army-showed impressive efficiency and tact in handling the physical transfer of the prisoners . There was considerable doubt , however , that the Indians would prove equally competent to handle the skulduggery sure to take place when the Communists get their chance to " explain " to each prisoner why he should change his mind and accept repatriation . And they were not prepared for a possible mass breakout attempt by the thousands who plainly feared the arrival of the Red " explainers . " " If one or two P.W.s try to escape , we will shoot them , " explained one Indian officer . " If there is a mass breakout attempt , we will do the best we can to stop it , but we do not want to quell it by mass killings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
