Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you ; even as the green herb have I given you all things. - Genesis 9:3 <P> Ever since the days described in Genesis , some men have liked meat and others have shunned it with loathing ( besides uncounted millions who eat none because they can get none ) . The roll of prominent vegetarians includes such diverse figures as Gandhi and Shelley , George Bernard Shaw and Gloria Swanson . Though all vegetarians are sure they are healthier than carnivores , and hope to live longer , medical science has had few facts on which to base a comparison . Working toward a Harvard degree in public health , Dr. Mervyn G. Hardinge has now collected more facts . <P> Vegetarians , Dr. Hardinge found , have to be divided into two major classes : moderates ( officially known as lacto-ovo-vegetarians ) , who will use milk and eggs but no flesh , fish or fowl , and purists , who exclude milk and eggs . He chose 86 moderates-some adults in the upper age brackets , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare that Dr. Hardinge could find only 25 adults ( none of them pregnant ) and one adolescent for his study . Then he picked 88 normal , omnivorous neighbors for comparison , and went to work on weights and measurements , blood pressure , blood analyses and a detailed check for physical disorders connected with diet . His major findings : <P> Vegetarians , especially the " pure " kind , are so diet-conscious that they nearly always get the right amounts of all the food elements , including protein ( which the moderates get from eggs , and the nuts from nuts ) . With milk and eggs , a vegetarian diet is fine for growing youths and expectant mothers . <P> Raised as such from the cradle , vegetarians grow as tall as anybody else . <P> The moderate adult vegetarians and meat-eaters averaged 12 to 15 lbs . overweight ; the simon-pures ran about eight pounds underweight . <P> Blood pressure and most of the chemicals in the blood average almost the same in all three groups . However , moderate vegetarians have a little less cholesterol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikingly less . ( This might mean something if doctors can ever figure out the tie-up between cholesterol and heart-and-artery disease . ) <P> Dr. Hardinge could come to no conclusion as to whether his vegetarian subjects are going to live longer than their fellows . He could not even tell whether they get as many colds . But the vegetarians are at least as healthy as their kin who spend a lot of money for steak . One likely reason appears in Dr. Hardinge 's study : vegetable-eaters spend so much time working in their gardens .
