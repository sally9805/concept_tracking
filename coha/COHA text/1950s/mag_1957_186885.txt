As the season of epidemic polio moved northward , the quality and effectiveness of U.S. polio vaccine were being debated last week on both sides of the Atlantic . In Britain , despite a shortage of home-brewed vaccine , Health Minister Dennis Vosper took a harsh jab at the American product by announcing that he had " accepted expert medical advice that Britain should not run the risk of importing poliomyelitis vaccine . " Snorted the British Medical Journal : " It is difficult to believe . . . that the safety of poliomyelitis vaccine as used now in the U.S.A. is seriously questioned . If its antigenic potency ability to stimulate production of protective antibodies is in doubt , some doctors might well like to give their patients the benefit of this doubt . " <P> In fact , though some U.S. experts were still exercised about highly technical problems involved in guaranteeing the vaccine 's safety , the public apparently had little cause for worry on this score . Since the flurry of vaccine-precipitated cases at the time of the Cutter incident ( TIME , May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made more stringent , and there have been no more such cases . <P> More nagging and worrisome today than doubts about safety is concern over the less dramatic question of potency . The National Institutes of Health rules require manufacturers to use a certain amount of formaldehyde to kill the virus . The trick is to use just enough to destroy the virus ' ability to cause infection , but leave a well-preserved virus corpse that can still stimulate the inoculated subject 's system to produce antibodies . <P> Before vaccine can go to market , potency is tested in chickens and monkeys . The manufacturer must test every batch ; N.I.H. spot-checks a batch here and there . How tricky it is to combine potency with safety was shown last month when Indianapolis ' Eli Lilly &; Co. , after successfully producing 109 million shots ( two-thirds of all used in the U.S. ) , had to withhold 6,000,000 shots from the market because they flunked their potency tests . Retesting will take another month . <P> In an effort both to reduce the amount of formaldehyde needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Detroit 's Parke , Davis &; Co. has added another step : centrifuging the virus ( after formaldehyde treatment ) and making a thin film which is irradiated with ultraviolet light . The company has produced 25.5 million shots this way , is the only producer using the method ( developed in cooperation with Chicago 's Michael Reese Research Foundation and General Motors ' research laboratories ) for U.S. sale ; Wyeth Laboratories uses it for export vaccine .
