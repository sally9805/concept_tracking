THE MANY LOVES OF DOBIE GILLIS ( 220 pp. ) - Max Shulman-Doubleday ( $2.50 ) . <P> Dobie Gillis is " a warm-blooded man of 18 summers " who enrolls at the University of Minnesota chiefly because " I was getting nowhere with the girls back home . " But poor Dobie-he has his setbacks at Minnesota too . Perhaps the barber who gives him crew cuts has mowed too close and sliced away what little brain he had . In any case , as described in this collection of magazine stories by Max Shulman , Dobie 's activities keep involving him in such things as academic failures , incarceration for love 's sake in a semester of home ec. , and the righteous rages of his father , who tells Dobie : " I will pound you into the ground like a tent stake . " <P> Perhaps to console himself , Dobie takes to devouring something called a " Varsity Voom " at the " Kozy Kampus Korner . " The recipe : " One scoop vanilla , one scoop chocolate , one scoop coleslaw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a happy coincidence , this mixture perfectly conveys the flavor of Shulman 's humor . Readers whose palates were tickled by Shulman 's previous concoctions ( Barefoot Boy with Cheek , Sleep Till Noon ) will find these stories just about as pleasant to swallow as anything he has written . People who have never tried Shulman might be well advised to test themselves first with a Varsity Voom.
