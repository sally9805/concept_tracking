Thomas Hollis , the London merchant-philanthropist , had nothing but good will for the struggling little colonial college in Cambridge , Mass. , but he decided something would have to be done about Harvard College 's library . The collection , he found in 1725 , was " ill managed . . . You let your books be taken at pleasure home to Mens houses , and many are lost , your ( boyish ) Students take them to their chambers , and teare out pictures &; maps to adorne their Walls . " It was really a wonder that the library had managed to survive at all . " Such things , " warned Mr. Hollis , " are not good . " <P> In spite of these early bunglings , the library did manage to survive . But it did not achieve its present position as the foremost university library in the U.S. without its share of crises . No man knows this better than 66-year-old Keyes ( rhymes with skies ) DeWitt Metcalf , who for 18 years has been-Harvard 's chief librarian . Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could report with as much authority as any man alive just what it means to run a great empire of books . <P> No Room . From Harvard history , he found ample precedent for trouble . On a stormy night in 1764 , all but 404 volumes of the 125-year-old library were destroyed by fire . In 1831 , Librarian Benjamin Peirce complained that the library was so crowded that " many of the books . . . have been excluded from their proper places by the want of room . " For years , the lament was the same , and even after Mrs. George D. Widener gave Harvard a vast new building in memory of her son , who went down on the Titanic , the space problem loomed again . <P> Keyes Metcalf took over in 1937 and soon realized that the Widener building would overflow within three years . What the university needed , he decided , was 1 ) a special library for undergraduates , 2 ) a new building for rare books and manuscripts , and 3 ) some sort of cooperative plan with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisition of new ones . As he steps out , Metcalf can reflect proudly that every one of these goals has been achieved . <P> In 1942 , the Houghton Library for rare books was opened , complete with temperature and humidity control . In 1945 , in response to a hint that Metcalf had dropped at a dinner some years before , Manhattan Financier Thomas W. Lamont ( 1892 ) gave Harvard $1,500,000 for a new open-stack undergraduate library . Meanwhile , Metcalf helped to set up the New England Deposit Library , in which colleges and universities in the Greater Boston area store their little-used books , and the Farmington Plan by which colleges and universities buy foreign publications in common , thus covering the foreign field thoroughly while avoiding wasteful duplications . <P> No Catching Up . Today , Metcalf 's musty , dusty empire includes 86 different collections scattered throughout Harvard 's various schools : in all , nearly 6,000,000 volumes worth at least $60 million . It has a regular staff of 350 , spends $2,400,000 a year . Some 15,000 students and scholars a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to see that they get the books they want as quickly as possible . Among the headaches this involves :
