Dulles &; the Treaty <P> Sir : <P> Those who firmly believe in the Christian approach to perplexing foreign and domestic problems are deeply indebted to TIME , Aug. 13 for the assuring , enlightening article about John Foster Dulles . <P> Could the atheists , the revengeful , the cynics or the skeptics begin to devise a more practical and rational peace treaty ? <P> <P> EDGAR H. HENDLER <P> Elmira , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : <P> . . . I hope I am one of the first to recognize the fact that Mr. John Foster Dulles would be the presidential choice of 1952-by both Republicans and Democrats-should the Republican Party have the good sense to nominate him . <P> <P> NORMA KING <P> Tucson , Ariz . <P> <P> <P> Sir : <P> . . . It is a real contribution to the cause of a just and durable peace . For Mr. Dulles , the Japanese Peace Treaty is the height of a brilliant career , marked by a keen intellect and a deep sense of real moral and spiritual values . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as a giant among a host of midgets in our government . <P> <P> ( REV . ) CHARLES E. HURST Clyde , Ohio <P> <P> <P> With Mother Bloor in The Jungle <P> Sir : <P> <P> ... It is not true that Ella Reeve Bloor " helped Upton Sinclair investigate the horrors of Chicago 's stockyards , which he dramatized in his novel The Jungle TiME , Aug. 20 . " My investigating was done in the autumn of 1904 , and E.R.B. had nothing to do with it . <P> In the spring of 1906 , when President Theodore Roosevelt asked me to go out with his investigating commission , I sent E.R.B. and her husband , paying their expenses , to help the commission meet the workers . A year later , when the New York Herald asked me to go and make another investigation , I again suggested E.R.B. , who went with a Herald reporter , and the report they brought in was suppressed by James Gordon Bennett , owner of the Herald . . . <P> <P> UPTON SINCLAIR <P> Monrovia , Calif @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Most scientists , reiterates TIME , Aug. 13 , believe in God . It would be interesting to know if these learned men could say , as did the eunuch baptized by Philip : " I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God . " If they can say this , I argue , then this country is on the verge of the greatest spiritual awakening in history . If they can not , we are plunged once more into a sterile pantheism , Fatherless and cold . <P> <P> LEWIS WILLIAMS <P> Philadelphia <P> <P> Sir : <P> Scientists who believe in God are simply exposing dark , untidy corners of their minds . Those who say they can not accept chaos probably mean they can not accept the ignorance which they humbly offer as a promise for their belief . . . <P> A scientist , of all persons , should be able to stop where knowledge stops , namely with Nature , and be bold enough to confess and to live with the great gulf of the unknown which lies beyond . . . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Sir : . <P> . . . The trouble with such articles and others like it is the support they lend to a belief that scientists are beating a retreat to some more or less anthropomorphic god , Catholic , Protestant , Hebrew , etc. , and it just ai n't so . <P> R. S. TOMAN Chicago <P> <P> Hearst Obit <P> Sir :
