Restoring an old master is always a ticklish job . When Belgian authorities announced last fall that they were planning a major cleanup job on the 15th Century Adoration of the Lamb by the brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck , they drew a chorus of protests . The Lamb is Belgium 's No. 1 art treasure . It had already suffered through 500 years of wars , fires , thefts* and the ministrations of countless well-meaning artist-restorers . <P> Last week Belgian art lovers could breathe easy . The restored Lamb , back in place in Ghent 's Cathedral of St. Bavon , looked better than it had for centuries . Long-obscured flowers sprouted from the grass , the grey clouds that once hovered about the holy dove had become a rain-bow-hued nimbus , and a lovingly detailed background landscape emerged clearly from the greenish-brown mist of generations . Everywhere , colors brightened to the rich blues , yellows and reds the Van Eycks had originally painted . <P> The experts began with a painstaking study of the painting 's twelve panels with microscope and X-ray photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattened out blisters with warmed spatulas . With mild solvents , they removed centuries of varnish ( sometimes twelve layers deep ) and retouchings , and they scrupulously avoided doing any retouching of their own . <P> Ghent townspeople , examining their cathedral 's prized possession , noted one startling change . The mystic lamb now has four ears instead of two-the extra pair being the work of an early retoucher . " It would have taken two or three more months to remove the extra ears , " explained an official . " And Ghent wanted the painting back . " <P> * Most recently by the Nazis , who earmarked the Lamb for Hitler 's private collection , finally hid it in an Austrian salt mine , where it was recovered in 1945.
