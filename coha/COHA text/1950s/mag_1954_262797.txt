Busy at her chores as Washington society columnist , picture-pretty Austine ( " Bootsie " ) McDonnell Cassini Hearst , 33 , has had trouble finding enough time for her children and husband , Publisher William R. Hearst Jr. , boss of the 16-newspaper and magazine empire . Last week the family won out . In her column , " Under My Hat , " published in the Washington Times-Herald ( syndicated to ten other papers as " Washington Whirl " ) , she wrote : " Ah Washington ! After more than ten years of covering the Washington parade ... I shall soon say goodbye to a regular deadline . . . Mostly for two very good reasons-my two little sons ages four and 16 months . " <P> Bootsie began her column in 1943 when her first husband , Igor ( Cholly Knickerbocker ) Cassini , went off to war . But , said she , it " was a luxury from the beginning . Now I find it 's a luxury that I ca n't afford . " The Times-Herald had no trouble finding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 55 , wife of Colonel Robert R. McCormick , the Times-Herald ( and Chicago Tribune ) publisher . Maryland 's new column started off this week on a subject on which both she and her predecessor are undisputed experts : publishers ' wives . Says Mrs. McCormick , with a touch of the outspokenness that has made her husband famous : " Publishers ' wives have an excellent sense of humor ... All lords of the press take themselves very seriously , so we have taken the lines of least resistance and are gay . . . Most newspapermen think that they form public opinion . This is somewhat true . . . but perhaps these little-known wives have more power than is generally known . Is not the female of the species stronger and more deadly than the male ? . . . Before the last G.O.P. presidential nomination , Los Angeles Times Publisher Norman Chandler 's wife and I both were against the candidate our so-important husbands had picked Taft . Our judgments proved better than theirs , as we picked the winner . "     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
