Since the days when he was enrolled on the staff at stately 400-year-old Diddington Hall , Rodwell Patience had been a model manservant . As an apple-cheeked footman , he was up at dawn each day to oil the lamps and trim the wicks . No faithful servitor in the vicinity could pad about with such noiseless efficiency or efface himself with such dignity as Patience , and he was a dab at removing the pips from his master 's grapes before setting them on table . <P> In 1930 , when the old squire of Diddington died , it was natural that Patience should be elevated by the new squire , Guardsman Noel Thornhill , to the rank of butler . <P> In private , Mr. Patience and Captain Thornhill often dropped the mask of formality and addressed each other as " Roy " and " Noel , " but Patience continued his devoted and impeccable service , even to the extent of tucking the new lord of the manor in bed each night . <P> Grapes , Gifts , Girls . Last year , when Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cecily , it was Patience the butler who did the proposing and it was Patience who stood by as best man at the wedding . Over the years , in gratitude for such devotion , Thornhill showered his butler with gifts of clothes and money , even of a nine-room house completely furnished . Out of sight of the squire , Patience lived like something of a lord himself . When the daily grind of grape-pitting at the manor was over , Patience would slip away , clad in the best , and whisk off 50 miles to London in his master 's Jaguar to flash 5 notes in the eyes of a bevy of girl friends . By the time his master married , Patience himself was already paying alimony to one exwife , supporting another and paying ardent court to a prospective third . Where , wondered the local police , who kept a closer eye on Butler Patience than his master did , was he getting the money to spend ? Lawyers and Legacies . Last December , as Captain Thornhill , lord of the manor of Diddington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their answer in the bare bedrooms of the old house itself . Patience was hauled off to court and charged with stealing some 3,000 worth of family heirlooms . The family lawyers promptly fired him . <P> Twenty-three days later , without ever learning of his former butler 's perfidy , the squire of Diddington died . In his will , he left Patience a handsome legacy-some $30,000 in cash and a lifetime income-on condition that the butler was still in his service when he died . <P> Last week , deprived of the riches his greedy impatience had cost him , Rodwell Patience , ex-butler , stood in a dock at Norwich and heard himself sentenced to six years in prison . " Thank you , my lord , " he said with an impeccable bow when the judge had finished .
