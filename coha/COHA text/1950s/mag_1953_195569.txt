The London Times , which has not missed a day of publication since it first came out in 1788 , this week showed how it hopes to make sure that it never will . The Times put on display a mobile newspaper plant which could produce 12,000 eight-page tabloid copies of the paper an hour , if the London plant were put out of commission . In three trailers and five trucks , the mobile unit has Linotype and stereotype machines , presses , typewriters , electric generators , and even desks for editors . The vehicles are connected by radio , so that the Linotypes in two of them can be operated by remote control from other trucks in the unit . If the Times should have to move from its plant in London in an emergency , the mobile unit would be supplied with news and instructions from two new high-powered radio transmitters the Times has built , one in London , the other in the country .                   @ @
