txt Secretary General Trygve Lie defended today his right to intervene in= the case of China 's representationin the United Nations . He denied any " surrender " to the Soviet . Union and announced that he intended to push ahead for a quick decision . The chief of the United Nations staff , faced with criticism that he had come out in favor of admitting Communist China to membership , called a special late-afternoon press conference to defend his actions . Mr. Lie again gave his backing to a United Nations legal memorandum , circulated among all members , which said that an applicant government should ' be judged on ability , to employ its national resources , exercise effective authority and command the obedience of its people . It was this statement that touched ' criticism that Mr. Lie was trying " to pave the way for Communist ' China 's admission . Once again , Mr. Lie put forward ' the . idea that the Security Council ' could start an inquiry to determine ' which of the rival Chinese regimes should sit in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memorandum and Mr. Lie took ' pains to single it out today , but , ' said he was not yet yeady to ad vance the proposal formally . Mr. Lie said it would be " nega-1 tive and destructive " to concentrate on placing the blame for . the United Nations ' troubles ? " there is always plenty of blame to be shared by everybody . " The first concern of , member nations , he went on , should be this : " To uphold and strengthen the organization that is the world 's one hone for peace . For that pur- pose it is necessary to reach a decision on what Government is to represent China in the United Nations and to reach it soon . " The Secretary General and his staff spent most of the day working on his statement . It was worded carefuly and apparently intended to answer charges that he was siding with the Soviet Union . After he read the statement to the press conference , Mr. Lie was reminded by a reporter of an editorial in . Tim NEW @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Mr. Lie felt that " a surrender to the Soviet U ; on is required to save the United Nations he should say so . " Mr. Lie was asked whether his memorandum . was a surrender to the Soviet and shot back : " Not at all . If my memorandum is a surrender to anything , it is a surrender to international law , to the practices of the League of Nations and the United Nations . It is a surrender to , common sense . " Against Franco Spain The . Secretary General was asked whether the criterion of ability to control a country 's resources and exercise authority applied to Franco Spain . He replied that his opposition to the admission of Spain was well-known , and that China 's case was different since she was a permanent member of the Security Council : and mentioned in the Charter itself . In his statement , Mr. Lie said it was his duty as Secretary General to assist in seeking a solution of problems like the case of China so that the United Nations could function effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many conversations with delegations and I am continuing these conversations , " he added . " I have also prepared a memorandum on the legal aspects of the problem of representation . In particular , : I have called attention to the differences between representation .. in United Nations bodies on the one hand and diplomatic recognition by states on the other . " Mr. Lie said that since the United Nations was divided ? " some recognize one Chinese Government , some another " ? he was working for a solution based on the " collective interests " of the organization rather than national interests . The Secretary General declined to answer a sharp attack on him by Dr. T. F. Tsiang- , delegate of Nationalist China , but said he was willing - to leave the question of law to the International Court of Justice and the question of politics to the " considered judgment of member nations and to history . " As for Russia 's boycott , Mr. Lie said he had always fought the policy of the walkout as harmful to . the United Nations . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in the work of the United Nations , especially in the Security Council . " Refusal to participate in United Nations meetings is not the way to help solve such problems as the question of China , " he declared . Mr. Lie said that he had received no " official reaction " to his memorandum on . China 's representation . " Unofficial ? " he was asked . " Unofficial  --  that 's my business , " he answered . Two Press Conferences Mr. Lie 's press conference on ! the China issue was his second of the day . Between press conferences , Mr. , I Lie conferred with Mahmoud Faw- , zi Bey of Egypt , one of the Se- curity Council members that does not recognize the Communists in China . Several hours before Mr. Lie made his statement , the Russian boycott was extended to the Economic and Social- Council 's interim ! committee on program planning . ! For the fifteenth time , a .
