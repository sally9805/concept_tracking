The marshal 's backside hung low and wide , as a marshal 's backside should n't . Not only that , but it was so close to the TV camera that it blotted out the scenery . Still , he was the marshal , and when he whipped his Colt from its holster and fired at the varmint standing at the other end of the dusty , deserted street , western fans could only suppose that things were back to normal . But on ABC 's Maverick this week , nothing returned to normal . The marshal 's first shot missed his man , and so did five more . Cried the varmint : " Shall I stand a little closer , Marshal ? " <P> Remarkable Resemblance . With that , Maverick gleefully dropped most of its own identity , loped off on a laconic parody called Gunshy . As played by Ben Gage , tall , broad-beamed Marshal Mort Dooley looked remarkably like Gunsmoke 's tall , broad-beamed Marshal Matt Dillon . But unlike Dillon , Dooley is a businessman ( " I own 37% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is Boot Hill-I like to come up here sometimes , to think , and maybe get a grave or two ahead " ) . With the help of the " finest undertaker west of Dodge City , " Doc Stucke ( clearly related to Gunsmoke 's Doc Adams ) , and loyal , limping Deputy Clyde Diefendorfer ( Gunsmoke 's Chester ) , Marshal Dooley watches hawk-eyed over the welfare of the town 's citizens , taking special pains that drunks who wander out of the saloons are courteously guided right back inside . <P> But there is one kind of hombre that clogs up Dooley 's craw so tight he can hardly spit : the professional gambler . When Bret Maverick ( James Garner ) rides into town in search of buried gold , Deputy Diefendorfer has no trouble spotting him for the cardsharp he really is . " He 's wearing a clean white shirt and a black necktie , " explains Diefendorfer , " and he 's winning , Muster Dooley . " Outraged , Marshal Dooley heaves Maverick out of town , has to repeat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're sure getting some strange breeds in Ellwood lately , " muses the marshal . " Remember that gunman who came through last week passing out business cards ? " <P> Ingratitude . Gunshy 's suet-headed hero was born one night last fall at a party at the home of Bill Orr , a Warner Bros . TV producer . Recalls Maverick Scriptwriter Marion ( See Here , Private ) Hargrove : " I said it would be fine if the classic opener was carried a step further - the long street , the shot of the marshal entering . The marshal takes a quick draw and fires and fires and misses . " By the end of the evening , Hargrove and Orr had worked out a rough plot , chosen their title . Hargrove picked NBC 's Gunsmoke as his target , he says , " because it is a tremendously solid show . The characters are sharply defined . It is easier to spoof a good western . A bad western does n't have anything to get your hands on . " Ungrateful Gunsmoke producers , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their show an episode about a lying , cheating heavy named Huggins . Maverick 's producer : Roy Huggins . <P>
