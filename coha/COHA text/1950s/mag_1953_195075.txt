As the new Administration moved in , a prime question was : Will the U.S. raise the price of gold ? For months , speculators and wishful thinkers had been puffing up the possibility , and support from abroad gave the glittering scheme some weight . <P> But the arguments for revaluation were dubious at best . The theory was that by raising the price of gold from $35 to perhaps $52.50 an ounce the U.S. could 1 ) increase the value of monetary gold stocks in the hands of foreign governments and central banks , 2 ) encourage hoarders to bring gold out of hiding . The $12 billion windfall from revaluation of the U.S. 's own $23 billion gold reserves could then be used to set up an international fund to stabilize weak currencies . <P> But currency juggling alone could not cure fundamental economic ills . At a time when most of the world was afflicted by inflation , revaluing gold would only make it worse by depreciating currencies . <P> There were other objections . The supposed benefits of revaluation would not extend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy , which are most in need . It was even debatable whether revaluation would bring gold out of hiding ; it might only increase hoarders ' distrust of paper money . And even though revaluation would artificially increase the value of a nation 's gold stocks , it would not stop the drain . Only a balance between imports &; exports could do that . If the balance were achieved , then even a small gold supply , such as France had , would be ample . And the price of gold had not been kept artificially low . Bar gold , in which the big trading is done , was quoted at barely $3 to $4 over the official price . <P> In the face of the overwhelming arguments against revaluation , the new Administration had no plans to change the price of gold .
