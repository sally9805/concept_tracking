Twelve years ago what remained of Germany 's bombed-out cities and factories was littered with more than 500 million cubic yards of rubble , and the German people-some of whom were getting only half as many calories as the average Chinese peasant-stumbled through the ruins of their homeland in dazed hopelessness . Last week the free half of Germany , long since recovered , was embarrassed by its riches . It had so much foreign currency that its hoard was becoming a handicap . <P> Adenauer 's West Germany , with but two-thirds the population of Hitler 's Reich , is now Western Europe 's richest nation . Thanks to a roaring export trade - this year its exports are expected to exceed imports by about $1 billion - West Germany 's gold and foreign-currency reserves have jumped since the end of 1952 from $1 billion to $4.8 billion . In gold and dollars alone , the West German republic now holds $3.6 billion , half again as much as Great Britain . In the European Payments Union , where France is nearly $2 billion in debt to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up an additional $3.5 billion credit , and it is increasing at the rate of more than $100 million a month . <P> The Drain . Paradoxically , this ever-mounting wealth is becoming something of a worry to the very man who did the most to bring about " the German miracle " - Economics Minister Ludwig Erhard . By selling them far more than it buys , West Germany has been steadily draining the slender gold and dollar reserves of Britain and France . Should the drain continue unabated , there is danger that Britain and France will declare the Deutsche Mark , like the dollar , a " scarce " currency and will then be able to impose stiff tariffs and import quotas on West German goods . Worse yet , a continuation of Germany 's lopsided trade balances threatens the European Payments Union itself , and with it the best mechanism for Europe-wide free trade . <P> Faced with these threats , Erhard and his colleagues have been doing some unusual maneuvering to get their foreign funds back into circulation . Not long ago the Bonn government agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment on loans which will not legally come due for several years . Twice in a year and a half Erhard has slashed tariff rates in an effort to increase West Germany 's imports . Wherever possible , weapons for the new German army are being ordered from Germany 's debtors ( Turkey , Austria , Belgium ) . Last week Germany announced its intention to reduce tariffs on fruit imports from European neighbors to the lowest level permitted by law . <P> Bad Behavior . None of this has appeased the debtors . Instead , for months past , French and British economists and pundits have been suggesting that Erhard revalue the Deutsche Mark upward ( as France has just revalued the franc downward ) . Instead of its present 23.8 official rate , these economists would like to see the Deutsche Mark worth 26 . " Will Germany now concede , " asked the London Economist last week , " that to hold the mark 's value low . . . amounts to bad creditor behavior ? "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
