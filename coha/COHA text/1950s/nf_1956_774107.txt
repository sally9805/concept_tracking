When steam-power took the place of the water-wheel , Yorkshire again had the advantage of coal-mines close at hand , while Norfolk had to bring coal by sea . So the centuries-old East Anglian cloth trade came to an end just at a time when the distress which followed the Napoleonic Wars was most acute . Many families , unable to make a living , moved to the new industrial towns on the Yorkshire coal-field . Others emigrated to Canada or the United States to find employment in the new lands . As we have seen , the introduction of new methods in textiles was unpopular , chiefly because of the dread of being out of work. , One writer complained that " the employment of machinery was one of the greatest evils that ever befell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to riots by bands of machinebreakers . The best known are those who in 1811 ? 16 called themselves Luddites ? perhaps after Ned Ludd , a half-witted lad of Leicestershire , who , being unable to catch someone who had been tormenting him , destroyed some stocking-frames in a fit of rage . The Luddites in various districts vented their rage on the particular kind of machinery which seemed to threaten their employment . In Nottingham , they attacked the stocking-frames because the master hosiers began to reduce wages and make stockings on wider machines . In Lancashire , the Luddites were handloom weavers ; they succeeded at the third attempt in burning a steam-loom factory at Westhoughton , in April 1812 . In Yorkshire , it was the " croppers " who were Luddites ? these were skilled workmen who cropped the nap on the cloth to give it a smooth surface ; they objected to the use of the shearing-frame , which replaced their work . As a result some rioters were hanged , and others transported to Botany Bay in Australia . But their demonstrations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fail , were not altogether unreasonable , and we may be glad that the Luddites won the sympathy of the poet , Lord  | Byron : for it was true that people were being thrown out of work by the machines and were not at once re-employed elsewhere . This caused terrible suffering . But it is also true that in the end the use of machinery increased the demand for labour : the machine-produced goods were much cheaper and were sold in much larger quantities , so their manufacture in the long run found work for far more people than could ever have been employed under the old system .  | INCREASE in trade made it essential for traders to have better means of transporting their goods . Coastal shipping had long flourished and it continued to expand : until the close of the nineteenth century it carried a greater weight of cargo than made and it was not until the latter half of the eighteenth century that any great progress began to be made . Arthur Young , an agricultural expert who made tours at that time through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads were often little more than bridle-paths , quite unfit for any kind of wheeled vehicles . He advised travellers to avoid the roads around Newcastle , which " must either dislocate their bones with broken pavements or bury them in muddy sand " . The Norfolk roads he described as " ponds of liquid dirt " , while the Essex roads were " so narrow that a mouse can not pass any carriage " . In winter , the road between Kensington and London was an " impassable gulf of mud " . King George II and his Queen once spent a whole night on the road when going the eight miles from Kew Palace to St. James 's Palace , and once the coach overturned in a ditch . It is little wonder that highwaymen found easy prey on such roads . Though the four horses were changed at every town , it took four days for a coach from London to reach Manchester or York , while the journey from London to Edinburgh took ten to fourteen days . Turnpike Trusts The great obstacle to improvement lay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parish responsibility : they were renewed , improved , and repaired to the extent and by the methods which  | suited the needs of the people who lived there . The needs of longdistance travel and transport ? except for horse riders and trains of pack-horses , which could get round the holes and unsafe stretches of highway ? were simply ignored . The solution was the Turnpike Trust ; we hear of them occasionally as early as the reign of Charles IT , but it was the difficulty of moving the army northward to meet the Jacobites in 1745 which caused the need for them to be generally recognized , and 1773 is the date of a law which made it easy to administer them . Each Trust consisted of local people who were willing to invest their money in improving a stretch of main road in their own locality . Having improved it and arranged for its upkeep , they were empowered to recover their expenditure by a toll on every vehicle or beast driven along their road . Soon the turnpike gates on the high roads were almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traveller bound for Oxford would pass through one near the modern Marble Arch and a second at what is still called Notting Hill Gate . If the caricaturist Rowlandson is to be believed , such a gate was a very lively place and its corpulent keeper had a busy time enforcing his placarded list of tolls on coaches , carriages , and horse- and donkeyriders . The erection of turnpike gates and the vast improvements with which they were associated , ushered in the age of the flying coach and the private post-chaise , racing to Bath or Brighton or Gretna Green at nearly twelve miles per hour . For humbler purposes , too , pack-horses began to disappear when covered wagons could move more easily . Roads arid Bridges But the Turnpike Trust itself was merely a way to raise money for the roads : its importance was that it gave scope for inventive minds to introduce better gradients and drainage and more durable and smoother surfaces . Towards the end of the eighteenth century three great road-makers were at work ? John Metcalf ( " Blind Jack of Knaresborough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty years Metcalf ? blind through smallpox at the age of six ? was at work superintending the making of roads in Yorkshire , Lancashire , and Derbyshire . He invented a smooth , durable  | road surface , made by pounding small stones together , and he tested the surface and slope of a road by walking to and fro , tapping the road with his hollow stick . The second famous eighteenthcentury road-maker and engineer , Thomas Telford , became road surveyor in Shropshire . He advocated solid foundations , with a firm , moderately cambered surface . His chief work was in Scotland , where , between 1803 and 1821 , he constructed 920 miles of road and more than 1,200 bridges . As a result of his work traders and travellers were enabled to move freely between England and Scotland ; this helped to bring a new era of prosperity to North Britain . In southern Britain , Telford 's best-known work was the great London to Holyhead road , along the line of the old Roman Watling Street , which he furnished with new bridges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Straits and beyond . An even more famous road-maker was John Loudon MacAdam ( 1756-1836 ) , a Scotsman , who found a way of making roads as good as , but less expensive than , those of Telford . Even when a  | boy at school , MacAdam made a model section of a road . As a youth he went to New York , and there became a successful merchant . Later , back in this country , he experimented at Falmouth , and was able to put his ideas into practice , first as surveyor-general of the Bristol roads ( 1815 ) and finally , in 1827 , as general surveyor of roads for the Government . He realized , like Metcalf , the need for well-drained subsoil . If the subsoil were well drained and the road raised above the general level , then the subsoil would be strong enough , without the solid foundations of Telford , to bear the weight of the road surface and the traffic passing over it . His method was to make the top layer of the road of small broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weld together into a hard smooth surface . To ensure that the stones for the road surface were not too large , he used to tell the stonebreakers : no stone should be larger than can go comfortably in the mouth . On one occasion MacAdam is said to have expostulated with an old man who was breaking the stone into too large pieces , only to have the old man pop a piece easily into his mouth . But the mouth was large and toothless ! In various parts of England he helped to plan , repair and build a great network of roads , on many of which the mail coaches ' could travel at an average rate of eleven or twelve miles an hour , a speed that would have been thought impossible thirty years earlier . Visitors to this country from Germany and France were highly impressed by British roads . Whereas in 1706 the coach from Newcastle to London took eight days , in 1820 on the good roads the journey could be made in forty hours . The coaches had been immensely speeded up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most rapid passenger transport . To send heavy goods might take weeks ; normally they would go by sea where possible . It was this slowness of goods transport which stimulated the construction of railways and , earlier , of canals . MacAdam 's plan for road-making is still in use , though in these days of motor traffic what were once called " macadamized roads " are reinforced with tar , and the surface is now known as " tarmac " . The construction of bridges was a problem which had to be faced by some road-makers . The old method of building a bridge  | was to sink either large boulders , or baskets filled with stones , into the bed of the river as foundations to support the arches . The old London Bridge was built in this way , stood for centuries , and supported rows of houses . But the art of bridge-making did not make much headway until the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries . Then progress was rapid , owing to the work of famous bridge-builders and engineers , such as Smeaton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who attended Leeds Grammar School as a boy and became a Fellow of the Royal Society before he was thirty , had studied the canals and bridges of the Netherlands . His most famous bridge , 900 feet in length , was built across the River Tay , in Scotland . Telford 's Menai Suspension Bridge , which carried his Holyhead road across to Anglesey , had the central portion supported by chains , so as not to interfere with the navigation along the Straits below . Rennie built the old Waterloo Bridge in 1817 , and his son built a new London Bridge in 1831 . When bridges for railway traffic were built , even greater strength was required ; but the main problems had been solved by these great pioneers in civil engineering . Smeaton founded the first society for the profession , from which the Institution of Civil Engineers was developed in 1818 , with Telford as president . Canals The bad roads of the eighteenth century made the carriage of heavy goods ? such as coal , iron , clay , pottery , and machinery ? very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we have seen , but the course of rivers is often irregular , and they may suffer from droughts and floods . In the second half of the eighteenth century , canals or artificial waterways were made . The first English canal-maker was James Brindley , a Derby- shire cottager 's son . Brindley was largely illiterate , but possessed high ability . He became a wheelwright by trade . From 1759 he was employed by the Duke of Bridgewater to construct a canal from the Duke 's colliery at Worsley to Manchester , eleven miles away . Brindley began by cutting a tunnel ( or adit ) straight from the coal workings . He invented water-tight embankments to carry the canal through bogs ; and finally brought it across the River Irwell by an aqueduct at Barton Bridge which was regarded as a great triumph of ingenuity . Brindley trained his workmen or navvies , and fitted up special boats as forges and carpenters ' shops , which were floated along each section of the canal as it was made . The canal proved a great success , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke then had the canal extended to Runcorn , thus connecting Manchester with the Mersey estuary and so with Liverpool . When the whole canal was completed , it was so much used in preference to the bad roads , both for goods and passengers , that the tolls paid for its use brought the Duke a large fortune . Brindley next undertook a greater piece of work , the Grand Trunk Canal , which , when completed , extended southwards from Runcorn through the salt and pottery districts to join the Trent at Wilden Ferry . The first sod of this canal was cut by Josiah Wedgwood , the potter , one of the chief promoters , in 1762.1 The canal , with all its branches , had a total length of 139 miles , and brought great benefit to the important pottery industry . Large quantities of clay , lime and coal had to be fetched from some distance ; and the finished goods were bulky , brittle , and difficult to carry by road . The Grand Trunk Canal reduced the cost of carriage on clay and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also made bread cheaper by reducing the carriage on a quarter of wheat from 20s. to 5s. for a hundred miles . During the four years from 1790 to 1794 , no fewer than eightyone Acts of Parliament granted permission to cut canals . Among the other famous canal-makers was John Smeaton , who constructed the Forth and Clyde Canal in Scotland . Another Scottish canal , the Caledonian Canal through the Great Glen , was the work of Telford and financially a failure . His best work in this field was  | the Ellesmere Canal , famous for its two aqueducts , which forms part of the Shropshire Union network linking the Mersey , Dee , and Severn . In general the canal was a perfect example of a laboursaving device . A General History of Inland Navigation , published in 1792 , described canals as " roads of a certain kind on which one horse will draw as much as thirty horses on an ordinary turnpike road , or on which one man alone will transport as many goods as three men and eighteen horses usually do on common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rather slow means of transportation at best , and there were often delays at the locks ; through-traffic was also seriously impeded by the absence of any standard width of water-way . But the development of England during the Industrial Revolution of the late eighteenth century and the early nineteenth century owed much to the canals . The pottery towns of Staffordshire , for example , trebled in size within a generation of their coming into use . Ports also benefited enormously by being brought into direct communication with the industrial districts . Lastly , canal transport helped farmers , who were provided with a wider market for their crops as well as a cheaper means of obtaining manure and other bulk supplies . Thus the canals are one factor which is common to the industrial and agrarian revolutions .  | WHILE the invention of new machines was bringing about an Industrial Revolution , important changes were taking place in the eighteenth century in agriculture ? through the enclosure of the open fields to form compact farms where better farming could be practised . Clover and deep-rooted lucerne for cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their value for improving the soil and breaking it up with their long roots was not at first understood . The horse-drill for sowing seeds , and the horse-hoe for weeding , had been invented by Jethro Tull in the very early years of the eighteenth century ; his method of sowing seeds in rows some distance apart actually produced a strike of labourers who believed the right way must be to scatter broadcast as in Biblical days ! Nevertheless , Tull persevered , and eventually produced a book , Horse-hoeing Husbandry , with diagrams showing how easily his machine could be made . Among other pioneers of eighteenth-century farming was the 2nd Viscount Townshend , who began farming in 1730 , and by his constant praise of turnips as a crop earned the nickname of " Turnip Townshend " . At his estate of Raynham in Norfolk , he introduced a new rotation of crops known as the Norfolk system of four courses , namely : turnips , barley or oats , clover , wheat . Thus he was able to keep all his land in use instead of letting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each year , as under the old system of the Middle Ages . His new rotation of crops not only improved the land itself , but root crops and clover meant winter  | food for cattle ? and therefore fresh meat for people during the winter . His soil at Raynham was light and sandy , and in earlier days " two rabbits had fought for every blade of grass " , but under the new cultivation it was greatly improved . Coke of Holkham Another Norfolk farmer , Squire Coke of Holkham , inherited in 1776 a badly cultivated , unproductive estate . He applied new techniques , often with more care than their original inventors had shown , and at the end of a long life ? he died as Earl of Leicester in 1842 ? had multiplied his rent-roll by ten , while his tenant farmers prospered with him . By draining and manuring the light soil , Coke succeeded , to everyone 's surprise , in growing corn . He also did much to improve the breeds of cattle and sheep ; he studied grasses to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , beginning in 1778 , Squire Coke had a meeting at sheep-shearing time to which he invited farmers ? sometimes 7,000 ? from all parts of the country to discuss agriculture . " Everybody made use of expressions towards Coke which affectionate children used towards their parents " ? wrote Cobbett , a farmer and journalist who did not , as a rule , have much to say in favour of the landlord class . Meanwhile another farmer , Robert Bakewell , of Dishley , Leicestershire , experimented in scientific cattle-breeding . Taking advantage of the improved feeding provided by root crops and clover , he produced a breed of sheep , " New Leicesters " , nearly three times the weight of the long-legged , bony creatures previously reared . He then turned to cattle with equal success , and provided such good beasts that other farmers began to take more interest in cattle-breeding and so improved the meat supply . His work was continued by the Colling brothers , who after a visit to Dishley began to develop the modern breed of shorthorn cattle on their own farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? set up a model farm at Windsor , and even wrote articles for the Annals of Agriculture , a monthly publication which was continued for twenty-five years ( 1784 ? 1809 ) by Arthur Young . Young 's Tours of agricultural in- vestigation have already been mentioned ; in 1793 he became secretary of the newly founded Board of Agriculture . This was not the direct ancestor of the modern government department of that name , but a national society for collecting facts and figures and reports about new methods , and it offered prizes for essays on farming and for inventions of benefit to agriculture . This propaganda , as we should call it , was very necessary because farmers were slow to change , having always provided for themselves and for a local market in traditional ways and without being exposed to much competition . The result was a series of further improvements , which came slowly into use . New methods of draining the land were preached in Warwickshire and perfected in Perthshire . In 1813 Sir Humphry Davy published his Elements of Agricultural Chemistry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Scotsman ( Meikle ) invented a threshing machine as early as 1786 , which came quickly into use in the Lothians : but in 1830 this machine , through which the steam engine was  | harnessed to perform an agricultural task , was still a novelty in most parts of England . These new methods brought prosperity to wealthy landowners , able to spend money on experiments , on machinery , and on new breeds of cattle to improve their stock . For example , in the background of the scene in which Thomas Coke is proudly inspecting his Southdown sheep , Holkham Hall appears ? the magnificent mansion he built with his farming profits . But it was impossible to practise the new farming on the old large " open " or unfenced fields divided into " strips " . At the beginning of the eighteenth century , as we have seen , much of the land was cultivated in the old style as it had been throughout the Middle Ages . But as long as his land was not fenced off , a farmer could not grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaten and trampled on by other men 's cattle when they were given the run of the common fields after harvest . A man might see that his land could be improved by drainage , but where could he carry the water without making a neighbour 's land sodden ? If a man tried to produce a better breed of cattle , as Bakewell was doing , the beasts had to mingle with the ill-kept village herds , usually infected with footrot , scab and other diseases . Again , it was difficult to keep one 's own crops free from weeds when a careless neighbour 's strips were overrun by thistles . Further , much time was wasted in going from strip to strip ; and the land itself was wasted in the balks and pathways separating the strips . Enclosure Acts In his tours over England , Arthur Young saw that if agriculture was to prosper it must make use of new methods . He also realized that as these methods could not be used on the old open fields , the latter must go , and the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were carried out by general agreement among all concerned , the usual method was for each village to obtain its special Act of Parliament . A few such Acts had been obtained under Queen Anne and George I , and over two hundred during George II 's reign ; but even at the accession of George III in 1760 , the open-field system still existed in about half  | the counties of England ? in a roughly triangular area on the east side of the country , bounded by the East Riding of Yorkshire , Norfolk , and Wiltshire . From about 1760 onward it became more evident that efforts must be made to increase the food supply of the country . The population of England and Wales was almost certainly growing rapidly in the later decades of the eighteenth century ; this growth was very marked in the towns . Another reason for increasing the agricultural output was the series of wars with France , which made it impossible to import much corn from abroad . With bigger demand came bigger prices ; and this made many farmers anxious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to acquire a greater acreage . The number of enclosures therefore increased . During George III 's reign some 3,200 Enclosure Acts were obtained , including in 1801 a General Enclosure Act which simplified the procedure . The actual process of enclosure , after an Act of Parliament had been passed , was carried out by Commissioners . They were generally named in the original petition asking for the Act , and their appointment was ratified by the Act . They were often three in number , and might be peers , gentlemen , clergymen , or farmers ; sometimes they acted without fee , but usually fees and travelling expenses had to be paid . The Commissioners generally held a public meeting in the district , and then appointed a valuer and surveyor . Each holding of land had to be valued and measured ? and this was no light task . The Commissioners had to allow for the roads , either public thoroughfares or private roads leading to individual farms , and they could make regulations as to drainage . But the main task was the redistribution of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the manor and all owners of land in the common fields , and of all who had legal claim to meadow , pasture , or use of the common had to be considered . It was a most intricate and complicated business . At the end , when the reallotment of land was finished , each landlord or farmer would have , instead of his former scattered strips and his right to a share in the common , a compact allotment of land , a farm or farms , where he could work and carry out improvements untrammelled by his neighbours . Next came the expensive task of fencing or hedging  | the newly allotted farms . Boundary fences for each total share had to be put up , and payment for them was exacted from each farmer in proportion to the size of his allotment of land . The interior fencing of fields was left to the farmer as he chose . The whole business was most costly , from the beginning , when the petition had to be drawn up and presented to Parliament , until the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were visits to London with travelling expenses and delays which also cost dear . Between the passing of the Act and the completion of the Commissioners ' work of reallotment five or six years might pass . During that time there was uncertainty and confusion , and the land might be badly farmed in consequence until the changeover was settled . Effects on the Poor On the face of it , the system was a fair one . Parliament did not pass the Bill unless the owners of four-fifths of the area of property to be enclosed were in favour ; it sent , as we have seen , Commissioners to settle the redistribution ; and every strip belonging to the old open fields was replaced by an equivalent area . But the small man was nevertheless at a great disadvantage because the compact piece of land which he received had not only to replace his arable strips but also the use he had formerly had from the common ? the untilled land where he ( like his neighbours ) had kept his horse and cows and a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the free timber and firewood on which he had always relied . And the poorest class , the cottagers , who had no arable strips but picked up a living from the common did not , at least if they were newcomers to the village , necessarily receive any compensation at all . Sometimes the freemen of an ancient town still share an unfenced common , such as the Port Meadow at Oxford ; more often it is a little village green which survives to remind us of what was lost when the compact modern farms with their hedged fields came into existence . The hedges or fences , too , cost money and , together with the proportion of the cost of the award which had to be paid by each person who benefited , were another thing which made it harder  | for the small farmer to keep his farm . Many peasants sold their bit of land to a more fortunate neighbour . They became landless men and worked as whole-time agricultural labourers : the big new farms were mainly arable and would need more men . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake in the country " was one strong reason for a movement of " surplus " population away from rural areas into the new industrial towns or overseas , which continued all through the following century . In this way the cultivation of the land passed mainly into the hands of men with capital . Small freeholders , who had been the most independent type of yeoman ( because , being actual owners of their land they need obey no squire ) , kept their farms as long as prices were high . But at the end of the French Wars many of these had to sell up their possessions and go to the towns . In the end nothing was left of the ancient system of agriculture but the one or two unenclosed villages , such as Laxton ( Notts ) , which still stand out , as seen from the air , in strange contrast to their neighbours . Even Arthur Young , who had for years advocated enclosure , was forced to acknowledge the " knavery of commissioners and  | attorneys " acting under the Enclosure Acts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acts the poor are injured , and most grossly " . Oliver Goldsmith in his poem , The Deserted Village , lamented that . . . a bold peasantry , their country 's pride , When once destroyed can never be supplied . The hardships of the villagers were increased during the Industrial Revolution by the gradual loss of their other means of livelihood , hand-spinning and part-time weaving . The spinning-wheel , in particular , had been a regular source of income , for under old conditions it required six or eight pairs of hands to prepare and spin the yarn needed by one weaver . But by the end of the century , wool was being spun in factories , so the women and children of the countryside lost their small earnings . The menfolk also found that , when the power loom began to spread , the hand loom could no longer be brought out to supplement the profits of a small holding . Then there were the incredibly harsh Game Laws ? seven years ' transportation was the penalty for being found by night on open land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbearable thing of all was the knowledge that the great agricultural changes , which enormously increased the nation 's stock of wheat and meat , had brought no improvement at all to the lot of the landless rural worker , who eked out a miserable existence on inferior bread , potatoes , and cheese , washed down with weak beer or weaker , unsugared tea . Other Considerations Nevertheless , the future lay with the large compact farms , where the farmer had capital for purchasing machinery and stock and for improving the land . One of the reasons which led to a great increase of enclosures was the desire of men who had made a fortune in trade or industry to become landowners . As early as 1724 , Daniel Defoe had noted that on estates near London families of local gentry were being displaced by families enriched in business ; and Cobbett , the writer who admired Squire Coke of  | Holkham , felt very differently about the people from London whom he termed " the Squires of Change Alley " . The possession of land had political and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Parliament in 1832 , nobody but landowners was entitled to vote in county elections , and even later every candidate for Parliament was nominally supposed to prove himself to be a substantial landowner : the landed interest was the basis of political power . Parliament was controlled by landowners . The possession of land also conferred social distinction , for the lord of the manor or squire was the local magistrate or Justice of the Peace . But beside political and social distinction , the keen business man who invested money in land would expect profitable returns . He wanted to bring as much as possible of the open fields and the " common " under his control to farm according to modern methods for profit ; or he might let the land after enclosure to tenant farmers at a high rental . It is now clear that , though much distress was caused by enclosures , they were essential to work the improved methods of agriculture , and without them it would have been impossible to feed the growing population in the factory areas . It is possible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggerated by some writers : Goldsmith is said by Lord Macaulay to have introduced into his English Deserted Village ' conditions characteristic only of Ireland . For it must be remembered that waste land also was enclosed , particularly during the Napoleonic war , and this bringing of new land into cultivation to meet the increased demand for food meant more , not less , agricultural employment . During the wars , too , tenants often took advantage of high profits to buy their holdings . During the years 1800 ? 50 no English county , however rural , showed an actual decline in population , though London and the counties containing the new industrial areas showed by far the greatest increase .  | Foa centuries wood had been the principal fuel for household use ? except in the districts where outcrop or surface coal was easily obtainable . Wood had also been used in great quantities ( in the form of charcoal ) for smelting iron ore . Two loads of wood were required to make one load of charcoal , and two loads of charcoal were needed to smelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the forests and woodlands of England were dwindling , and Parliament began to fear that ship-builders would be short of timber at a time when there was an increasing demand for new ships for trade and defence . One result of the shortage of wood was to increase the mining of coal to provide fuel for domestic and industrial purposes . This led to a rapid opening of coal seams in Northumberland and Durham . Coal was sent from Newcastle to London by sea , and so it was known as sea-coal . At the time of the Civil War in Charles I 's reign , the coal-pits of Northumberland and Durham were so valuable that some people suspected the Scottish army of planning to gain permanent possession of them . Apart from corn , it was already the chief article of internal trade . Transport of coal otherwise than by water was difficult on account of bad roads . Until the cutting of Brindley 's canal from Worsley to Manchester in 1759-61 , coal was carried in baskets on pack-horses . The usual load was 280 pounds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The digging of the canals not only assisted the development of the Lancashire coal-field , which up to the middle of the nineteenth century was second only to north-east England in importance ; it also started the coal industry of the South Wales valleys , with iron ore close at hand and convenient sea communications from Cardiff .  | Owing to the increased demand for coal , the surface outcrops were used up , and miners had to dig down . At first they made pits thirty or forty feet deep , and worked over a small radius from the bottom of the shaft . More than half the coal was left in the form of huge pillars to support the rocks above . Lower seams had been reached by 1776 , and pits as much as 600 feet in depth were being worked . These deep pits presented great difficulties ? drainage , raising the coal to the surface , ventilation , and the danger of explosive gas . As the mines went deeper the danger of flooding increased , and pumps were set up , worked by various contrivances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by wind and water is unreliable , and this led to the introduction of Savery 's primitive steam pump , which had been patented in 1698 as " an engine to raise water by fire " . Newcomen improved on Savery 's engine , and Newcomen 's engine was in use in many coal-mines during the earlier part of the eighteenth century . The way in which this was developed into the modern steam engine , which could raise the coal as well as pump up the water , will be described in the next chapter . Raising the coal to the surface was another problem which had to be faced as mines became deeper . In most collieries some kind of mechanical apparatus came into use , either a simple windlass or horse gin or crane . The winding tackle served also to lower and raise the miners . But some pits had no mechanical gear , and the coal was carried to the surface by means of ladders in baskets slung over the shoulders of women and children , the distance climbed being equal , in at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even after the steam engine came to be used for haulage , there was still the difficulty of finding a rope strong enough to take the strain ; the wire cable was not invented until 1839 . Prevention of Mining Accidents The problem of ventilation was equally difficult . Most coalmines contain harmful gases , and are only made fit to work in by having pure air forced through . The first method adopted was the provision of two shafts on different levels , the air rising in one and being drawn down the other . The air from the down shaft was  | conducted through the mine workings by a system of trap doors which were opened and closed by boys and girls . This method was not sufficient for deep mines , and towards the end of the eighteenth century a mining engineer , John Buddle of Wallsend , invented an exhaust fan . This drew the foul air out of one shaft by suction , which caused a current of fresh air to be drawn down the second shaft . Upon the ventilation of the pit depended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller pits " choke-damp " , or carbon dioxide , was the chief danger ; but in the larger and deeper pits there was sometimes " fire-damp " , or methane . Fire-damp was the more dangerous , for the flame of the miner 's candle caused it to explode without warning , while choke-damp usually put the candle out before its suffocating fumes took effect on the miner himself , thus giving him time to escape . Fire-damp made the lighting of mines a serious problem . The usual method was by the naked flame of a candle or by a lantern . Explosions were frequent , and caused great loss of life . A clergyman , the Rev. John Hodgson , who once lost over ninety of his parishioners in a colliery disaster , became the pioneer of a movement to establish societies for the prevention of mining accidents . The first of these societies was started in Sunderland in 1815 . At about the same time the old North of England practice , by which mining disasters were exempt from coroners ' inquests , was at last abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to abolish the still more shameful Scottish custom of compelling miners to serve for life in the same pit as " bondsmen " , punishable if they ran away . Thus public attention was directed to the need for greater safety in mines , and by 1815 an important step forward was made . After careful experiments , Sir Humphry Davy ( 1778-1829 ) , one of the leading scientists of the time and a pioneer in chemistry , invented a safety lamp in which the flame is shielded by a cylinder of metal gauze fine enough to let the light through . But the conductivity of the gauze disperses the heat of the flame throughout the cylinder , so that the temperature is not high enough to ignite any gas outside , as the naked flame would have done . The lamp proved very useful . When told by a friend that he ought to patent the lamp as  | it would bring him a small fortune , Davy nobly replied : " I never thought of such a thing . I am only too happy to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In more recent years electric lighting has been introduced into the main galleries of the mines , and portable electric lamps are used in other parts ; but as late as 1926 half a million Davy lamps were still carried in British mines , so that the " cap " of burning gas within the gauze might give its warning of the presence of fire-damp . As the Industrial Revolution progressed , coal became more and more important to feed the ever-increasing steam-engines , for the iron manufacturer , and for millions of new domestic hearths . In the first seventy years of the eighteenth century the output may have doubled to reach an estimated total of six million tons . Between 1770 and 1816 the six million became sixteen million , which in turn was nearly doubled by 1836 , and the 1836 figure more than doubled by 1854 , the date when accurate coal statistics began . Deeper shafts were sunk to reach lower seams of coal . By the end of the eighteenth century , wooden props were being used to support the roofs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unworked coal . But , because of the cheapness of child labour , boys and girls were still employed in coal-mines : some dragging the trucks of coal through the low , narrow tunnels , others crouching for hours in the dark by the side of the trap doors which they had to open and shut as the trucks passed . It was not until many years later that reformers denounced the hardships endured by these children , and steps were taken ( in 1842 ) to forbid work underground for females of any age and boys under ten . Modern Developments Since then governments have ceaselessly tried to im prove safety and working conditions in the mines . An important law in 1850 established the principle of control , by officially listing coalmining as a dangerous trade and requiring all mines to be inspected . Miners ' earnings were next safeguarded against fraud by an Act of 1860 which gave them the right " at their own cost to station a person ( being one of the persons for the time being  | employed ) to take account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of check-weighman , as he is called , was strengthened by two later laws . An Act of 1872 raised the age at which boys might be employed to twelve years ; it was again raised in 1900 to thirteen years ; in 1911 to fourteen years ; and in 1944 to fifteen ( to be raised later to sixteen ) . An act of 1881 gave the Home Secretary the right to hold inquiries into the causes of accidents in mines , while another Act in 1896 regulated the use of explosives in blasting . The record of beneficial legislation is almost endless . But even at the present day , though it is no longer ill-paid or unregulated , the work of the miner at the coal face continues to be hard , cramped , dirty , and above all dangerous . Up to the First World War our output of coal grew continuously , though as early as 1865 a well-known economist ( Professor Stanley Jevons ) had written a gloomy book on The Coal Question , i.e. what was to happen when it was all used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentieth century the annual total was 242 million tons , about four times the figure for the 1850 's , and this was sufficient to provide both for all our own needs and for threequarters of the total weight of British exports to all destinations . Well might Kipling write , as he did : Oh where are you going to , all you Big Steamers , With England 's own coal , up and down the salt seas ? We are going to fetch you your bread and your butter , Your beef , pork and mutton , eggs , apples , and cheese .  | THE STORY OF THE STEAM-ENGINE THE steam-engine was the key invention which made the Industrial Revolution possible , and after a century and a half is still one of our main sources of power : even in the days of jet aircraft the steam locomotive seems to keep its fascination . Let us trace the story from the beginning ? a long story , since the wet , white cloud we wrongly call " steam " must have attracted attention as soon as early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . What is popularly called " steam " is really the little drops of water condensed from steam by the cooler air surrounding it , steam itself being an invisible gaseous substance which is formed when water changes into vapour . Steam expands , that is , it takes up more room than water . When the water in a kettle boils and turns into steam , the lid of the kettle begins to shake and rattle ? because the steam is expanding . It is this expanding power of steam that has made it so useful to mankind . Nearly 2,000 years ago a Greek named Hero , living in Alexandria , who had invented a number of curious machines , experimented in the use of steam . He placed water in a globe with an opening at the top ; in the opening were two tubes . When the water was heated the steam passed out through the tubes and kept a ball turning round and round on two pivots . This apparatus was just a curious toy , but it showed that steam might be made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with steam , trying to make it useful . In the seventeenth century an Italian physician named Branca , and a French scientist named Papin made useful experiments . Papin discovered a way of using steam in a cylinder , so that none of its power was lost . But it was not until 1698 that an English military engineer named Thomas Savery made use of steam for an important practical purpose .  | At that time the coal-miners ( as stated in the last chapter ) , having worked out many of the seams of coal near the surface , were trying to reach lower seams . As they dug deeper into the earth water collected in the pits and there was danger of flooding . Savery invented what he called a " fire engine " for pumping water out of mines by filling a cylinder with steam , condensing the steam by means of cold water so that there was a vacuum , or space , in the cylinder , and then allowing the cylinder to fill with water by means of the pressure of the air . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it drained the pit without the hard work of pumping by hand and baling with buckets . Several of Savery 's engines were set up in mines , and enabled miners to work at a greater depth ; but the engines were slow and used a lot of coal . In 1711 Savery 's original patent was improved by his partner , Thomas Newcomen of Dartmouth , an ironmonger or blacksmith by trade . His first engine was used in a coal-mine , where they were most needed ; they were also used in the Cornish tin-mines . They had many faults , and were wasteful of fuel , but remained in use for over seventy years ? especially in coal-mines , where fuel consumption was of no importance ? and during that time doubled the depth to which the miners could go . A Newcomen engine developed 5- h.p. , and it could raise 50 gallons of water a minute from a depth of 156 feet , which seemed no small achievement ? until Watt set to work on it . James Watt James Watt ( 1736-1819 ) was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the University of Glasgow . He had already interested himself in the subject of the steam-engine when , in 1764 , he was given a model of a Newcomen engine to repair . He became absorbed in its improvement , and after many failures he succeeded in making a model for an engine which would be greatly superior to Newcomen 's . But Watt had neither the money , nor the materials , nor the workmen to make a full-size engine which he could show to mine- owners and others , and no one in Glasgow took any interest in the scheme . At last Watt found a patron in Dr. John Roebuck , who in 1759 had opened the first big Scottish iron works at Carron in Stirlingshire , where the famous guns called carronades were later produced . An engine was built at Carron , but at that time there were no tools accurate enough for such work . The result was disappointing , and as Roebuck was now suffering heavy losses in his own business , he could not afford further interest in Watt and his engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up engines , and take a job as surveyor of a new canal that was being made . His work brought him to Birmingham , where he met Matthew Boulton , the head of the prosperous Soho Engineering Works housed in a fine new building at Handsworth , which was later ( 1802 ) to be the first large building ever lit by gas . Boulton was a keen business man , and he agreed to take Watt into partnership . The engine , which had been first patented in 1769 , was brought to the  | Soho Works , where the workmen were more skilful than those at Carron , and it was soon functioning well . The Boulton-Watt partnership , which began to operate in 1775 , was indeed an event of great importance in the development of the steam engine . For behind the inventive genius of Watt it put the solid business ability and established position of Boulton . Matthew Boulton ( 1728 ? 1809 ) was himself an outstanding man . He had succeeded to his father 's business of silver-stamping , but he had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred workmen , making metal articles of various kinds ? perhaps the largest hardware business of the time . He was quick to realize the possibilities of development in Watt 's early engine , for even in 1776 , when the biographer Boswell visited the Soho works , Boulton declared : " I sell here , Sir , what all the world desires to have ? Power . " Later Boulton used steam power in coining , and produced coins for the East India Company and a copper coinage for Great Britain . He took interest in scientific and literary matters , and was a Fellow of the Royal Society . When Boulton and Watt retired , eventually , in 1800 , they handed over the business to their sons , whom they had taken care to have well educated ? and so the partnership went on in the names of Boulton and Watt . Watt 's engine was from the outset a great improvement on Newcomen 's , because it had a separate condenser : when steam was generated in a cylinder which could be kept continuously hot and condensed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the result was a machine of greater power and lower fuel costs . Late in 1775 , the first Watt engine to be sold was at work in a colliery near Birmingham , and a second was on order for John Wilkinson 's blast furnaces at Broseley in Staffordshire . Soon they were being sent to the Cornish tin-mines , where within ten years they had replaced all but one of the old wasteful Newcomen engines . But these engines were only an improved form of pump : in flat country they were sometimes used as part of a water-mill , pumping back the water that had turned the wheel . The next step was to make an engine with a rotary motion which could drive machinery for all purposes . With the help of his foreman , William Murdock , Watt solved this problem . Moreover , in the next year ,  | 1782 , he patented " a double-action expansive working engine " , in which the piston was worked up and clown by steam , a great improvement on the earlier engines in which the piston fell by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for general use in iron works , for forge-engines and bellows in blast furnaces , and for use in the sheet-iron rolling mills . In these mills , waterpower had been used , but steam proved a great advantage , especially in severe winters , as a letter from Boulton to Watt shows : " There is not a single water-mill at work in Staffordshire , " he wrote , " they are all frozen up , and were it not for Wilkinson 's steam-mill , the poor nailers must have perished ; but his mill goes on rolling and splitting ten tons of iron a day , which is carried away as fast as it can be bundled up ; and thus the employment  | and subsistence of these poor people are secured . " The new engines were also adopted in some potteries , breweries , flour-mills , and ? from 1785 onwards ? in spinning factories . " The people of Manchester are steam-mill mad , " wrote Boulton to Watt . Steampower began to take the place of water-power , and mills and factories built on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in towns where coal was cheap . But we must not be tempted to exaggerate . By 1800 Boulton and Watt 's Soho works had produced more than fifty steam engines and the steady growth of the coal and iron industries made it easy to provide the material to make and work more of them . Nevertheless , in 1830 the go-ahead cotton factories still used 30 per cent of water power , and all the industries of Birmingham , where steam-engines were first built , required only a dozen new ones a year ? in 1826 , for instance , thirteen , averaging 121 h.p . For the early steam-engine was a hand-made , individual machine : there were no standard spare parts to be had ; and when it developed a fault ( a fairly frequent occurrence ) , the men to repair it must be sent for from the original makers . These men who understood steam-engines ? successors to the millwrights who used to mend the old water-driven corn-mills ? were not numerous : not till the middle of the nineteenth century did they come to form a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture of standard steam-engines had gradually become possible with the development of machine tools . The Earliest Steamboats The next chapter in the story of the steam-engine was to make it useful on the water . Boats were rowed by oars ; ships were moved by the power of the wind in their sails . Rowing was hard work ; sails were useless if there was no wind , or if the wind was blowing in a completely contrary direction . In some parts of the world at certain seasons there was hardly a breath of wind , and ships might lie becalmed , unable to move for days , even weeks . When a steam-engine could be made to move a boat or a ship , that would be a great advantage . The earliest experiments culminated in a paddle-wheel steam- boat , which was used to tow barges on the Forth and Clyde Canal in 1801-2 . This was seen by the American , Robert Fulton , who took one of Watt 's engines home with him to America , and in 1807 was steaming up the Hudson River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Cornet , ' which was built on the River Clyde in 1812 , and made regular trips between Glasgow and Greenock . When the first steamboat appeared on the Thames many people disliked it ? " It is strange to hear and see it hissing and roaring , foaming and spouting like an angry whale " ? but they were already four in number by 1814 . The early steamships were small and the coal took up too much space ; they were preferred to sailing-ships chiefly in river navigation and ferry services , such as that maintained by the Dover-Calais steam packets , which began to run in 1821 . As late as 1847 sailing-ships made up 96 per cent of the British mercantile marine , and iron was still a novelty in shipbuilding ( as we shall see ) long after it had set its stamp upon the whole life of the age .  | THE NEW IRON AGE IT has been claimed that iron comes second only to the air we breathe and the water we drink in the list of substances essential to the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 cwt. of it , we are told , to every ton of the earth 's crust ? that we easily forget our dependence upon its use for nearly every kind of building and machinery , cutting-tool and magnet . But when we look back to early history , we readily divide the Ages of Stone and Bronze from the Iron Age when men first used implements and weapons of iron . It would be just as reasonable to make a further division at the time of the Industrial Revolution , when iron first became adaptable to its innumerable modern uses , and to say that after about 1800 civilized man was living in a New Iron Age . The smelting of iron was carried on in Roman Britain , and throughout the Middle Ages . For smelting the iron ore , charcoal continued to be used till the middle of the eighteenth century . Smelting was a local industry to be found in various wooded districts , because it was easier to carry the ore to the forests than to carry timber to the iron-fields . The most important iron-smelting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Forest of Dean , and the Wrekin district of Shropshire . As Kipling sings : Out of the Weald , the secret Weald , Men sent in ancient years The horse-shoes red at Flodden Field , The arrows of Poitiers . During the Tudor period and afterwards , when timber was needed for shipbuilding , several Acts of Parliament were passed to check the cutting down of trees for iron-making and these Acts  | greatly reduced iron production . A cheap and effective substitute was now obviously needed for the use of charcoal in smelting the ore . In 1619 an ironmaster named Dud Dudley began experiments , but for various reasons he was not successful ; his iron works were attacked and wrecked by jealous charcoal burners . The iron industry was in fact hampered by lack of cheap fuel until the middle of the eighteenth century . Abraham Darby of Coalbrookdale in Shropshire discovered about the year 1707 that , if the coal was first turned into coke , it could replace charcoal in the high-temperature furnace used for smelting . But for various reasons the secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the original Abraham Darby 's grandson of the same name , about 1760 . By that time the coking process could be worked under more favourable conditions , because engines , driven first by water-power and then by steam , were becoming available to produce a strong blast in the furnaces . The production of iron and steel involves many processes . First , the metal must be extracted from the ore , which comprises other substances . This is done by smelting in a furnace ; in order to obtain the great heat necessary , a blast of air is forced through coke , ore and limestone ; hence the name " blast furnace " . Iron ore smelted in a blast furnace with coke and limestone becomes pig iron , the raw material from which cast iron , wrought iron and steel are made . The use to which the iron is to be put determines its subsequent treatment . If cast iron is required , the " pigs " are re-melted in a foundry , and poured into moulds . To make malle'ble or wrought iron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a forge . For steel , a still more elaborate process of reheating is needed to get rid of impurities and a proportion of carbon must be added , making true steel very costly . Cast iron is hard but brittle ; wrought iron is soft but holds together ; steel is strong and tough . Abraham Darby 's process applied only to the first stage of the iron industry , the smelting of the ore into pig iron . But there was greater demand for wrought iron , and this required refining ? a process which used more charcoal than smelting had done until Henry Cort , a Lancashire man , discovered a cheaper method . In 1783 Cort planned a method of rolling out the iron by passing it  | between a series of rollers , instead of beating it with heavy hammers while still in a molten condition . The next year he perfected the use of the reverberatory furnace , invented twenty years earlier , in which the only contact between the fuel and the metal was the flame beating down on the pig iron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the furnace . Workmen used long poles to stir or " puddle " the molten iron to drive out impurities . The metal was then taken to the rolling mills in large balls weighing about eighty pounds each . The use of the reverberatory furnace at last enabled coal to be used instead of charcoal . One of the difficulties of the eighteenth-century ironmasters was to obtain an effective blast to maintain the heat in the furnaces . At Coalbrookdale and other early iron works a water-wheel was used to strengthen the draught . Then Smeaton attempted to solve the problem with the help of blowing-cylinders , which were introduced at Carron about 1768 . Next , Watt 's steam-engine was employed by Wilkinson in 1776 for working the bellows in a blast furnace ; this , as we have seen , was a few years before it was adapted for working forge-hammers and to provide power for the rolling and slitting mills . Finally , a Scot , a collier 's engine-worker named James Neilson , suggested heating the blast before it entered the furnace . The " hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success ; it cut down the consumption of coal by one-quarter , thus further reducing the cost of production . When the use of coal was possible for all processes of the iron industry , the ironworks ceased to be located in the woodlands , and were established on coal-fields , as in Yorkshire , South Wales , South Staffordshire , and the valley of the Clyde . The last charcoal smelting furnace was extinguished in 1827 . The cost of manufacture was lessened , and Britain was able to produce all the iron needed for her own use and a surplus for export , instead of having to import pig iron from as far afield as the Urals , which had been her position earlier . Between 1788 and 1830 the total output of pig iron , the raw material of the iron manufactures , was multiplied tenfold.  | New Uses of Iron The use of iron for various purposes rapidly increased . Iron rails were laid down for the tramways at the collieries as early as 1767 . By 1840 iron was even coming into use to build sea-going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new mills , and later for steam engines . The perfecting of cast-iron production enabled iron to be employed for domestic purposes ; it was cheaper than copper , bronze , brass , or pewter ; it was more easily handled than stone or wood . But these developments , and the kind of enterprise which made them possible , can perhaps be illustrated best from the career of the greatest of all the eighteenth-century ironmasters . John Wilkinson , born in 1728 , the son of a labourer in a Cumberland village , is said to have founded the family fortunes while still a boy by inventing a box-iron for laundry work , which his father patented . Next he developed the first accurate metal-cutting tool for large-scale work ? a hollow , cylindrical boring bar , mounted on bearings . This was valuable for cannon and also to give precision to the steam-engines with which Watt was then experimenting . At Broseley in Staffordshire in 1776 ? 80 he equipped himself for the large-scale manufacture of iron by introducing four of Boulton and Watt 's engines to blow the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firms , for Wilkinson became a regular supplier of cylinders for the engines of which Boulton and Watt became " designers and erectors " . He also made 32-pounder cannon and howitzers for the government . In 1779 he built the first iron bridge , with a 100-foot span , across the Severn at Broseley ? an elegant structure , well suited to figure in an engraving " by permission most respectfully inscribed " to King George III ? and sent his munitions down the river in the first iron barge . He cast all the ironwork for the Paris waterworks and erected the first steam-engine in France ; he built a Methodist chapel of iron . His nickname , " Iron-mad Wilkinson " , is usually associated with his wish to be buried in an iron coffin ; but a better illustration of his enthusiasm and single-mindedness ( qualities which shaped the careers of many of his fellow-industrialists as well ) is the tradition that Wilkinson never wrote a letter without a mention of iron .  | Steel Fine steel , used mainly for weapons , cutting implements , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England before the seventeenth century , when Sheffield began the manufacture of shear-steel , chiefly from very pure Swedish iron . The first step towards the improvement of English steel production was taken by Benjamin Huntsman in the middle of the eighteenth century . Huntsman was a Sheffield clock-maker , who had difficulty in obtaining steel of a suitable quality for his work . In 1740 he succeeded in producing steel of a uniform quality by remelting the shear-steel in clay pots , known as crucibles , subjecting it and a small admixture of carbon to great heat , and so freeing it from slag . The best steel is still made in crucibles , but the process was too costly for general use , and a century passed before steel production was developed by further invention . The new iron age was then succeeded by the age of cheap steel , in which we are still living .  | Engineering With the revolution in textiles and the invention of machinery , with the development of the steam-engine and the growth of the iron industry , there went the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what an engineer is . In America he is the driver of a train ; in this country he may be anything from the man who repairs a motor car or wireless set to a highly trained scientist who has specialized in engineering . In the early days of machinery three trades supplied the men who undertook engineering jobs ? clock-makers and instrument-makers ; millwrights , who set up and repaired the machines in the textile factories and worked at first with wood and water power ; military engineers , who understood cannon , siege works , and something of roads and canals . Basic to the development of engineering was the machine-tool industry . The machine tool is a mechanically-driven tool which is employed to make the parts of other machines , and since these parts are machine-made they can be standardized . A skilled workman using a machine tool can make any number of parts of the same size . Except for the boring-machine mentioned above , Boulton and Watt had no such tools ; they had to depend on hand tools , though they improved on some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , devised some machine tools to use in making his patent locks , and he also invented an hydraulic press . He trained Henry Maudslay , who about 1800 perfected a self-acting lathe . Whereas previously a worker had had to hold the cutting or shaping tool against the work , now the tool was fixed in a rest and adjusted to the work . Maudslay also made a very accurate measuring machine , which led to yet finer work on the lathe . Such machine tools came into common use in the 1820 's and enabled precise work to be done . Indeed , they were essential to the development of engines . " How " , asked Nasmyth later , " how could we have good steam engines , if we had no means of boring a true cylinder or of turning a true piston-rod , or of planeing a valve face ? " James Nasmyth was trained by Maudslay , and set up for himself in Manchester in 1834 . Five years later he invented his steam- hammer , which cheapened the production of wrought iron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the paddlewheel shafts which were beginning to be required for steamships . His contemporary , Joseph Whitworth , also worked as a machinetool maker in Manchester . He devised various standard sizes for machine parts , for example , for screws . Thus parts became interchangeable , and the supply of spare parts was made possible . So it was that the making of tools became an industry in itself ? the machine-tool industry . " Tools " , it was said in 1841 , " have introduced a revolution in machinery and tool-making has become a distinct branch of mechanics and a very important trade , although twenty years ago it was scarcely known . " And with the machine tools , the machine makers were able to provide the machines and the engines required in ever-increasing numbers as the industrialization of the country went on . Machine-making also became more specialized . In the early days mill-owners had had to make their own textile machines before they could start to manufacture . But with the provision of machine tools , firms were established in the textile districts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was possible to distinguish three main types of engineers . There were the makers of heavy machinery , steam-engines , mill gearing , and hydraulic presses ; the makers of the machine tools ; and the makers of the textile machines . Engineers were employed by railway and steamship companies to construct the locomotives and the marine engines , and engineers of some kind worked also for contractors , and in the mills and mines to look after and repair machinery . In a country with growing industry engineering was a growing profession , and as industry developed in foreign countries there were also many opportunities for British engineers abroad .  | CHANGES IN OTHER INDUSTRIES : POTTERY AND SHIPS WE have now seen the big changes which transformed the textile industries , transport , agriculture , and the manufactures based on coal and iron . But the same period witnessed similar , if less dramatic , changes in other branches of industry . Let us examine one or two of these before we pass on to consider , in the next section of our book , the new ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potteries , that is the six North Staffordshire towns which have been united in recent times to form the city of Stoke-onTrent , owe the rise of their speciality very largely to the coming of the canals to that part of the country , as already mentioned . For it was the clay industry of Cornwall which supplied the material for the potters . In old days , drinking-mugs and plates for ordinary use were made sometimes of horn , or of wood , or of pewter ( the grey alloy of tin and lead ) which has lately come back into fashion . Cups and saucers were not needed until coffee and tea first came to be drunk in England in Stuart times , and they were then imported from China by the East India Company . But coarse earthenware pots and jars were already being made in north Staffordshire , where there were supplies of black clay and terra-cotta which baked into a buff or reddish-brown colour . There was also plenty of brushwood there for fuel . Like spinning and weaving , pottery was at first a cottage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oven made of turf with a roof of boughs , and heated with charcoal , where they could bake such things as the large jars , in which at that time butter was sent from farms to shops in London and other cities . Packmen came round the Staffordshire villages each week to collect the jars and pots to be sold elsewhere .  | At Bow and Chelsea there were potteries which tried to imitate the porcelain which came from China . The potters of Germany had already discovered that the secret of this fine ware lay in the material used for its manufacture : and in time they found deposits of the right kind of clay in Saxony . English potters at first used a mixture of pipe clay , sand from the Isle of Wight , and glass . But a great discovery was made about 1768 by William Cookworthy , a Plymouth druggist , when he decided that Cornish clay ( kaolin ) and china-stone were the materials the English potters needed to enable them to produce the fine kind of earthenware or " china " known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a china factory , but it was not a great success , and in 1777 his porcelain rights were bought by a Staffordshire firm with works at Stoke-on-Trent . The discovery of the china clay opened up a new industry for Cornwall , and in time the quarrying gave employment to many former tin-miners ; but the absence of coal in Cornwall prevented the setting-up of Cornish potteries on a large scale . The clay was therefore sent by sea to Chester , and later to Liverpool , and then conveyed laboriously overland to Staffordshire . The quarrying and preparation of china clay is still one of the great industries of Cornwall . It is not only sent to Staffordshire , but is exported to America and elsewhere from Falmouth and other west-country ports . Cornish clay is now also used in some other manufactures besides pottery . In Staffordshire , in the latter half of the eighteenth century , many changes took place . New methods of glazing were introduced . The white Cornish clay was used to make a thin layer over the local clay , so that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The increase in the use of tea and coffee , and in the number of coffee-houses opened in London and elsewhere , had led to a great demand for cups and saucers , and Staffordshire potters began making these in quantity . More ovens were built , but the supply of brushwood was not sufficient . Fortunately there were coal seams close at hand , and the potters were able to fetch sacks of coal to feed their ovens . But as time went on , machinery and new methods made the old ways of working out-of-date , though the potter 's wheel was still worked by hand ? in fact , there is still  | some hand-decoration of the more expensive products , even in the twentieth century . Instead of working in their own little sheds , the men had now to work for a master-potter for a weekly wage . The industry kept the coal-miners busy , and attracted to north Staffordshire various craftsmen , who made crates , sieves , and other things needed in the potteries . Transport was the most difficult problem the early masterpotters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Chester or Liverpool had in the early days to be carried across country by pack-horses to Stoke-on-Trent and Burslem , and the finished goods were carried by pot-wagons along the roads to the River Trent or the River Severn and thence distributed to other parts of the country . But Brindley 's Grand Trunk Canal , begun in 1762 , joined the Cheshire town of Runcorn on the Mersey to the Trent , and thus solved the problem of transport . We can now see how it came about that the first sod was cut by Josiah Wedgwood , the greatest master-potter of the eighteenth century , as one of the main investors in the canal scheme . Wedgwood Josiah Wedgwood ( 1730-95 ) , was the son of a Burslem potter and himself started work at ten . He became highly skilled at shaping pottery on the wheel , and it was he who perfected the fine art of English pottery . In the course of a most successful career , he built a large earthenware factory together with a village for the work people at a place near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in the reproduction of classical designs recovered from graves in Italy . Wedgwood discovered and invented many improvements and machines for mixing clay , and for modelling and glazing of china . He engaged clever artists , such as the famous Flaxman , to decorate his dine wares ; but he also insisted on careful work in the manufacture of ordinary domestic earthenware , so that the simplest articles were well shaped and finished . One of the improvements was to give a clean white finish instead of a dirty yellow . Wedgwood was not without rivals ? Spode , for instance , who , like Wedgwood , became potter to King George III ? and famous wares were established outside the  | Potteries area at Derby and Worcester . But from his Etruria works came a vast variety of goods . As a result , the use of earthenware ? " common Wedgwood " ? became general in English homes , while large quantities were exported to European countries and to America . Wedgwood himself was a real character . It was said that he used to stump around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfy him . On the bench alongside he would chalk : " This wo n't do for Josiah Wedgwood . " He worked tirelessly to raise standards , both by experiment in new methods and by trying to turn workmen who were sometimes drunken and lazy into skilled hands . He was very active in promoting turnpike roads as well as canals , and by these means he helped to reduce costs of transport and also loss by breakage . He also tried to raise social standards by starting and encouraging schools and chapels , and took much interest in public affairs . He was a man of cultural and intellectual interests , and a Fellow of the Royal Society : members of his  | family have been well known in public life down to our own time . His name indeed became a household word , as his pottery and that of other English potters went all over the world . A traveller in the early nineteenth century reported that , all over Europe , " one is served at every inn upon English ware " . New Types of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds ( such as " Iron-mad " Wilkinson 's ) suggested improvements , and it was another of the cases in which there was an obvious need for new development at this time . For under the Navigation Laws , which dated back to the time of Oliver Cromwell and partly even to the Middle Ages , it was in the main compulsory for British trade to be carried on by ships which were built , owned , and manned in British territory . There was also an expansion of the Royal Navy as a result of the wars against the French , especially the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars of 1793-1815 , and the need for a special kind of ship in the growing trade with India ? one that could carry the maximum of cargo on that long , expensive voyage and yet defend itself , if necessary , from attack in distant oceans . By the end of the eighteenth century the oak-built ship had reached its greatest size . The ships of the East India Company , the finest merchant vessels afloat , were about 1,000 tons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 2,000 tons ? onefortieth of the size of the largest Atlantic liners to-day . About 1760 it had been found an advantage to fasten sheets of copper to the outside of the ships below the water-line to give the ships greater speed . The copper did not become fouled by crusts of seaweed and shell-fish , nor was it eaten by the Toredo worm as was the case with the wooden hulls of earlier ships ; thus the vessels could move more easily through the water . Copper was expensive , but it did not need periodic scrapings . Moreover , the supply of timber for shipbuilding ( like the wood for producing charcoal ) was rapidly becoming used up , and shipbuilders began to experiment with the use of iron fittings to replace certain natural shapes of timber . This was the beginning of a great change . The mixture of wood  | and metal was followed in due course by the all-iron hull which made it possible to build much larger ships . As early as 1787 iron boats were built in north Lancashire for use on canals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1818 . Many people thought iron ships would never be possible . How could iron be expected to float ? Yet , strange as it may seem , an iron vessel did not weigh as much as a wooden one . Strong iron frames were only one-third the thickness of wooden ones ? only four inches thick , while those of a wooden vessel had to be twelve inches thick . This gave the ship more room for stowing cargo and shipbuilders were therefore encouraged to use iron , though the Royal Navy ( because of the deadly effects when iron plates were splintered in action ) used only wood as late as the Crimean War . Early in the nineteenth century , as we noticed in an earlier chapter , experiments were being made with steamships . But these first steamships were wide and clumsily shaped . They were driven by paddle-wheels , one on either side , but if the vessel rolled in rough weather , one wheel might be wasting energy by beating the air . In 1823 the General Steam Navigation Company was founded at Deptford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a small and uncertain business . For , while the early experiments in steam navigation were being made , shipbuilders were working on a newer and faster type of sailing ship , the clipper . Clippers , with fine lines almost like those of yachts , were first built in America , and when they appeared in British waters , notably the Thames and Mersey , British shipowners were aroused to compete against these American rivals for the carrying trade . The first British tea-clipper was built in 1850 , and until 1870 this remained the fastest type of vessel afloat . Sailingships of all kinds , making their voyages from London and the Clyde and Liverpool to every port in the world , were still the standard cargo vessels of the mid-nineteenth century . The Shipyards Shipbuilding on a small scale was carried on all round the coast in any convenient port or estuary , but the main centres in the eighteenth century were on the banks of the Thames and on  | Tyneside . On the Tyne , for instance , the work had originated in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " keels " ( as in the famous song ) , which were used to carry coal down the river to sea-going vessels off the coast . Later , coastal colliers were built , and finally still larger and more ambitious types of vessel , the iron and steel of the modern shipyard being readily available there . Plymouth , Portsmouth , and Chatham were concerned only with the construction or repair of the ships of the Royal Navy . For the first new developments we must turn to the Clyde , where the first British steamship , the Comet , was built by Bell in 1812 . This was the start of an enterprise , based on the accessibility of coal and iron , which in time made shipbuilding rather than the cotton manufacture the premier industry of Glasgow ; the manufacture of iron steamers was established there as early as 1841 . Another new centre was Birkenhead , which made the first iron paddle-steamer ever seen in America , and in shipbuilding rapidly out-distanced Liverpool . As for London , it was not until 1835 that iron shipbuilding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant Scottish engineer who migrated from Manchester . His yard was at Millwall , in between the West and East India docks . But Fairbairn had to face much conservative opposition , and  | although he built about a hundred iron ships of different sizes , in the end he turned his attention to bridge- and boiler-making instead . Thus shipbuilding is an interesting example of an industry where the new inventions were applicable but , for a long time at least , were only slowly and fitfully applied . In conclusion , we may notice two special features . Shipbuilding was a business which required much capital , to buy the raw material and pay for the long and elaborate processes of construction . It therefore had , almost from the first , big employers of labour , such as Sir John Laird ( 1805-74 ) , who in the first half of the nineteenth century practically created modern Birkenhead . On the other hand , as soon as ships came to be of any considerable size , a large number of workers were necessarily employed together in the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called , were one of the first crafts to form strong trade unions . The clash between big employers and the trade unions , beginning in the shipyards as early as 1825 , will be noticed in a later chapter . Ports and Docks The expansion of British shipping called for an expansion of port and dock facilities . The modern port systems , with their channels of approach , docks and landing quays , were a nineteenthcentury creation . London by 1800 badly needed docks . During the eighteenth century about three-quarters of imports into England passed through London , so that the Thames became congested with the fleets of merchant ships , and much of their eargo used to lie on the wharves out in the open . The first modern dock was the West India Dock , which was opened in 1802 . Within five years this was followed by the opening of two more docks ? the London and the East India ? on the north bank of the Thames , and the Surrey Commercial Docks on the south bank . The last named occupied the site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by whalers . Further evidence of the pressure of trade demands is given by the fact that within two decades Telford was at work constructing St. Katherine 's Docks , immediately below the modern Tower Bridge . The docks were built by joint stock com- panics , which charged dues for their use and for the use of the adjoining warehouses . Each of the leading provincial ports developed a similar system . Hull built its first dock on the site of its ancient fortifications in 1774 . Liverpool , as we might expect from what we already know of its rapid commercial growth in the eighteenth century , began early , its first dock being opened in 1715 , a second in 1753 . In the case of Bristol , on the other hand , where the Dock Company was incorporated in 1803 , high dock charges are regarded as an important cause for its loss of trade to Liverpool . Safety Measures Danger has never been far away on the seas , and therefore measures were sought to safeguard both the cargoes and the lives of the crews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habit of meeting at Lloyd 's coffee-house . Here they developed methods of insuring ships and cargoes . At first informal , the meetings of merchants led to an association , which eventually became the world-famous insurance organization of to-day . By the end of the eighteenth century Lloyd 's had a general form of insurance policy , and was issuing information on the movements of ships ; about that time , or a little later , Lloyd 's was keeping a classified register of shipping ? a valuable indication to shippers of the seaworthiness of merchant vessels . From an early date the need had been realized for lights to warn ships at night of danger spots . The exact origin of Trinity House is unknown , but a religious guild for mariners existed in the Middle Ages , and received a charter from Henry VIII ; it was soon responsible for various maritime duties concerning lights and buoys . Later on , the Corporation of Trinity House gradually took over control of privately owned lighthouses and built some new ones . Between 1800 and 1830 it was busily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in active competition with a newly established authority for Scotland , the poetically named Commissioners of the Northern Lights . In 1836 an Act of Parliament empowered it to purchase rights over coastal lights from the Crown and from private owners . The expense of building and  | working lighthouses the Corporation covered by the tolls levied on ships , but control over these dues was transferred in 1853 to the Board of Trade . The courageous efforts of lighthouse-builders is well illustrated by the story of the successive Eddystone lighthouses , built on the Eddystone rocks fourteen miles from Plymouth . The first was built in 1698 and a few years later was destroyed in a storm , its builder being drowned ; the second was built in 1709 but was destroyed by a fire ; the third was built by Smeaton in 1759 , but its foundations showed signs of weakening later on , in the nineteenth century . Trinity House decided on a new structure , and the present lighthouse was completed in 1882 . From time to time some fearful wreck on the coasts would arouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hillary , who lived in the Isle of Man and had seen many a wreck on its shores , put forward a plan which resulted in the foundation in 1824 of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution . This has proved a grand example of a voluntary charitable organization . It soon began to place life-boats at danger spots on the coast , as did also some private individuals and other societies . Experiments were made with different types of life-boat , and a policy developed for rewarding the life-boatmen for their dangerous services and paying pensions to the families bereaved by accident . The R.N.L.I . has grown into a large organization , but is still maintained by voluntary contributions .  | THE FACTORY TOWNS IN the next three chapters we shall look at some of the social changes at the end of the eighteenth and beginning of the nineteenth centuries . These were of course largely the result of the developments in industry and agriculture which have already been described . But in order properly to understand what happened it is important to bear in mind two other main facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of great wars . In 1775 ? 83 Britain had been fighting , first the American colonists , and then the big European alliance which was formed to help the rebels in America and to win back , if possible , what Britain had gained by her victories in the Seven Years War ( 1756-63 ) . After the American war had ended in our defeat , there was an interval of barely ten years before the outbreak of the last and greatest of our struggles against France , which lasted with two short intervals for twentytwo years ? up to the final overthrow of Napoleon . About the middle of this period it was officially estimated that more than 10 per cent of the male population of military age were under arms ; probably one more war-worker would be required for every two fighting-men . Such a situation could not fail to impose a heavy strain both on family life and on industrial organization . Moreover , the Duke of Wellington 's victory at Waterloo marks , not only the climax to a series of great military exploits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain and France . Napoleon had called England " a nation of shop-keepers " ,  | which prompted Pitt 's retort that it was also a nation which never lost its martial spirit . Napoleon realized that trade was the lifeblood of his main enemy , and he did his best to ruin British commerce by a blockade of British ports . But even Napoleon could not manage without British goods , and British coats , caps and boots for the French army were smuggled into France by way of Hamburg . On the other hand , when the British harvest failed in 1810 , and famine was near , Napoleon , anxious to obtain English gold , allowed the export of corn to Britain on payment of an export duty . Thanks to this action , famine was averted . And thanks to the courage and initiative of Nelson and to other British sailors and soldiers , Britain was able to hold her title of " Mistress of the Seas " and to keep her trade routes secure . As our industrial output rose , merchants were able to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the war years had been years of deep depression in trade , others had seen our exports mount to greater heights than ever before in our history . But a time of war is always a time of hardship for many people : in 1800 ? 13 there were no fewer than five years in which the average price of wheat exceeded 100s. a quarter . This fact encouraged acceptance of the gloomy forecasts made by the Rev. Thomas Robert Malthus in his Essay on Population , first published in 1798 . He taught that , apart from such special measures as deferment of the age of marriage , the growth of population always tends to outrun the growth of the food supply . Therefore permanent improvement in the standard of living of the masses , however desirable , was quite unfeasible . This dismal conclusion , widely accepted by the classes to which it was not deemed to apply , connects with the second main fact which governs this period . Britain was fighting against the greatest of revolutionary movements , and this had the effect , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform very unpopular because they could be denounced as unpatriotic , " the kind of thing we were fighting against " . Accordingly , the policy of our government in this period was to refuse to listen to the grievances of the workers ( or those who could find no work ) ; to assume that the employer would manage his  | business best without government interference ; and to concentrate on avoiding any possibility of a revolution in Britain by firm measures to check disorder.The panic outlived the war and the downfall of Napoleon . As late as December 1819 repression culminated in the Six Acts . One of these required public meetings to be sanctioned by magistrates ; another extended the heavy Stamp Duties imposed on newspapers , so as to put any kind of political periodical out of the workers ' reach . The Factory System We can now see how it was that the government welcomed the new factories , because they produced the wealth which helped us to beat the French , while it turned a deaf ear to complaints about the new conditions of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been attempts at introducing a factory system long before the Industrial Revolution . As early as the reign of Henry VIII , John Winchcombe ? " Jack of Newbury " ? is said to have employed six hundred workers , men , women and children , in various branches of the cloth manufacture ; and other clothiers of that time also set up houses full of looms . But workmen complained bitterly of exploitation by wealthy clothiers ; in most rural areas a special Weavers ' Act ( 1555 ) forbade one man to own many looms ; public opinion in general favoured the older system of work done at home . And so the development of the factory system was delayed until the eighteenth century , when conditions favoured important changes in the textile industry . A silk-throwing factory was set up at Derby in 1719 , but it was the invention of the water-frame fifty years later which ( as we have already seen ) made factories essential to the rapid development of cotton spinning . By 1769 our population , for reasons previously outlined , was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern history . Britain had a growing market for textile goods in foreign and colonial markets overseas ; prosperity had resulted in an increased demand at home also , and at the same time clothing was needed for our soldiers and sailors engaged in the recur- rent wars in Europe and beyond . This increased demand was more readily met by a system of mass production , and this encouraged the building of mills or factories to house the new machines , and to collect under one roof a large number of workers employed by a single capitalist master or by a partnership or company of capitalists . The growth of the factory system brought with it two important changes in the capitalist system as it had worked previously , in what is often called the " domestic " stage of industry . In the domestic stage , the capitalist provided the raw material , but not the spinning-wheels or , in most cases , the looms for weaving ; he was concerned with the purchase of the raw material and the sale of the finished product rather than with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the workers ' homes . But under the factory system the capitalist employer owned the machines as well as the raw materials ; the work was done on his premises ; and it became part of his business to study and improve the processes of manufacture . This change clearly made the workers more dependent on the employer than they had been before , and one of the most hated features of factory life was its discipline ? the need to start punctually , to work regular hours and to do the job systematically , things which people need not bother about when they worked in the privacy of their own homes . But at the same time the mustering of so many workers under a factory roof gave opportunity for forming trade unions , and these unions enabled the workers in due course to bargain successfully for better wages and better conditions of employment . Other results of the coming of factories and of new capital into industry , and of increased production , were a cheapening of goods and in the long run a higher standard of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . The factory system first grew up , as we have seen , during a period when England was engaged in a series of wars . One consequence was fluctuations in trade and employment from year to year : another was financial crisis , resulting in the suspension of cash payments by the Bank of England ( 26 February 1797 ) and the first introduction of income tax . Yet a third was a panic measure , following upon  | a whole series of Acts of political repression aimed at " revolutionaries " , by which the younger Fitt 's government forbade the existence of trade unions . These Combination Acts of 1799 and 1800 will be considered later , as they were the starting-point of the history of the modern trade union movement . The Village Poor But the actions of the authorities to meet the emergency of the French wars were not all of them repressive . The Berkshire magistrates , when they met at Speenhamland , near Newbury , in 1795 , intended at first to establish a minimum wage system for the county under the obsolete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they adopted in deference to farming opinion ? the " Speenhamland system " ? was well intentioned . Berkshire , followed by most of the other counties in southern and eastern England , decided to make up the wages of " every poor and industrious man " to a total sum fixed by the size of his family and the varying cost of a loaf of bread . The dearer the bread , the higher the wage ? that was reasonable ; what was not reasonable was the undertaking to make up wages , which meant that farmers had no reason to pay a living wage since the smaller wage got a larger addition from the rates . The result was that the rates became a terrible burden on the country , while a great number of farm labourers , though kept from starving , were made to feel that they were a class of paupers , because they were unable to keep themselves and their families by the wages they actually earned . Some of the big farmers began at this time to employ regular gangs of women for hoeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the women came from the labourers ' families , at the expense of home life and probably of health . The practice was not abolished by law until 1867 . Moreover , the new farming robbed many villagers of the strips of land which had provided much of the family 's food supply , and at the same time the money earned by the wife and children at wool-cleaning , carding , and spinning rapidly decreased . The handloom weavers , some of whom were also small-scale farmers , did  | not suffer appreciably by the competition of power-looms before 1815 , but their weekly earnings then fell fast , until in the 1830 's and 1840 's a whole-time weaver did not earn as much as 10s. a week . Under these new conditions it was difficult to maintain a family , and many villagers drifted reluctantly and by slow stages ( in days when there were no railways ) to the new factories and mines . It was made easier for them to go because the Law of Settlement had been modified . After 1795 it was illegal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually asked for poor relief . Movement of Population One of the most striking features of the rise of the factory system was the shifting of population towards the factories of the north and the Midlands . The new industrial areas increased their inhabitants very fast . At the first census in 1801 Manchester was the only town in Great Britain ( apart from London ) with a population which exceeded 100,000 . In the next twenty years Manchester reached 150,000 , and four other towns ? Glasgow , Edinburgh , Liverpool , Birmingham ( in that order ) ? had risen above the 100,000 mark . Moreover , Edinburgh was the only one of these five which had been of any considerable importance a century before . The very first factories , because they were dependent on water-power , had often been placed at lonely spots in the upper valleys of Pennine streams where the current flowed fastest . But from 1785 onwards the steam-engine had been installed in many spinning-mills , replacing water-driven machinery , and by 1815 it was also beginning to be used for the new power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large centres where coal was locally mined or otherwise obtainable . At the same time there was an increase in iron production to meet the demands for new machinery , which was now almost entirely of iron to stand the strain of steam power . Isolated villages on the coal-fields or near the iron furnaces in the north and Midlands rapidly expanded into towns . These districts had been poor and thinly populated and now became rich and crowded , whereas towns in East Anglia and parts of the West  | of England ? which had prospered under the old domestic system and were far from coal-fields ? gradually declined and superfluous villagers moved from many districts . Few people moved long distances ? many families went on foot and took their belongings with them . What usually happened was that they ventured to the nearest town or the next county , and it was the districts nearest to each of the industrial areas which contributed most largely to its new industrial population . The Irish travelled farthest but they travelled most easily , crossing the sea for as little as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Glasgow , and bringing with them from their native land an appallingly low standard of life and aspiration . All too often the Irish made slums where they did not find them , and what they made they perpetuated .  | This rapid movement of population led to acute overcrowding . New towns were built without proper supervision . There was in those days no planning of housing development to hinder this expansion : there were no building regulations , no sanitary inspectors , no government control , and indeed very few accepted standards even of decency , to prevent people from living where they chose or how they chose . A man who lost his job or his land in one place had no council house , no unemployment insurance or national assistance to enable him to go on living there . When he found a job in a new place he would welcome the enterprise of builders who ran up jerry-built cottages : for otherwise he would have had literally nowhere to live . And thus there soon arose a very grievous housing problem ? as our reformers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tidy up the towns which the early nineteenth-century had left for later generations . Men who bought building sites put up as many houses as possible on those sites . The rows of houses were crowded close together ; they were even built back to back , in which case through ventilation was impossible and half the rooms had no direct light . There was little attention to drainage , sanitation or water supplies . The building materials were usually of the cheapest quality , and there were special shortages which caused buildingwork to be scamped during the long war period . Lack of a good water supply was another of the evils of the new towns . Often water was sold : for example , at Hyde near Manchester , the poor people had to pay a shilling a week to water-carriers . " Many of the poor beg water , many steal it , " said a witness to a Royal Commission on sanitary conditions in 1842 . With this scarcity of water , even for drinking , impure water from stagnant ditches was used for cooking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now again after two world wars ? had to accommodate several families . And in those days of the early factory system , even undrained cellars were often let as separate dwellings . Two other essentials to health ? fresh air and light ? were also lacking . The old window-tax , increased in 1784 , amounted at one time during the Napoleonic Wars to 8s. for houses with six win- dows , or less ; ? 1 for seven windows ; ? 1 13s. for eight windows , and so on . To save expense , windows in older buildings were blocked up ? as we can still see to-day in some old houses ? and when new houses were built the number of windows was reduced as much as possible . Stairways were often without any windows , and were pitch dark at noon . Moreover , the windows in many houses did not open , and there was no inlet for fresh air . Factories , also , were built entirely to suit the work and not the workers . Until 1833 there was no State interference and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly drained and were full of holes . After rain the gutters were flooded with filthy water ; and at other times were full of all kinds of decaying refuse . There were no regular scavenging services . Proper sewers did not exist : the drains from the best houses emptied into underground cesspools . It is little wonder that typhus , cholera and other fevers were prevalent , though the arrival of the first great cholera epidemic from Russia in 1831 caused the first local boards of health to be established by Parliament . But as soon as the scare was over they were allowed to lapse . To sum up , between 1815 and 1832 the death rate , which had been falling for about a century , was again on the increase . How the workers lived was not then regarded as the business of the factory owner or capitalist ; in the early years of the factory system , when all was experiment and change , he certainly had enough to do in organizing the output and sale of the factory 's products . As the supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rate of wages , though the larger factories had overseers for engaging and dismissing employees , and for keeping the factory hands at work . Again , the factory buildings and equipment were also the concern of the employer ; but he normally regarded them from the standpoint of their cheapness and handiness without much consideration for health and safety . However , while the conditions under which men , women and children of the labouring class worked and lived were in many cases worse than similar families had experienced before the Industrial Revolution , the value of the wages was not . Provided they were not among the unemployed or special groups like the hand108 THE FACTORY TOWNS  | loom weavers , workers after the immediate post-war period , which may be said to have ended with a fall of prices in 1820-21 , were on the average better off than the generations before 1793 . As for the more limited group of workers employed in the new factories , a Government Commissioner declared in 1832 that their wages " were so large as to appear almost incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural labourers " .  | WOMEN AND CHILDREN ; THE FACTORY ACTS IN this chapter we are going to consider how women and children fared in this age of change , taking the children first , because the early Industrial Revolution brought some of them , the very poorest of the poor , into a prominence they had never had before . As we saw in the last chapter , the first factories were placed in the hills , where quick-flowing streams and rivers would turn the millwheel . But there were very few people living up in the hills of Derbyshire , Lancashire , and Yorkshire , so the difficulty of finding workers was solved by sending for children . One of the most terrible things about eighteenth-century life , as Captain Coram had shown , was the treatment of orphaned and deserted children , of whom London and the larger towns had great numbers for which to provide . The parish in which they were born used to apprentice them almost as soon as they could walk to any master who was willing to employ them and pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as apprentices were supposed to do , or were just used as cheap labour and , when they came of age , turned loose on the world without any special skill , depended on the sort of master they happened to get . These pauper apprentices were sent off in large numbers to the factories , where buildings of a rough-and-ready kind were put up for the children to live in during the long period , seven or ten or more years , of their legal apprenticeship . They had few rights of any kind , and no right to leave their employer 's service . This was so hard on the children that in 1802 a law was passed to improve the conditions in which they lived when not at work and to forbid the factory owners from making them work for more than twelve hours a day ; they were also forbidden to make them  | work at night . From this we can imagine the sort of life these children had been leading . But this particular form of employment for children was already coming to an end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built near the coal-fields and towns quickly grew up round them . The people living in those towns sent their sons and daughters to work in the factories , not as apprentices but as wage-earners , just as naturally as in earlier days they would have found work for them to do at home . The children did not earn more than a few pence a week , but it paid for their keep . The employer , on the other hand , wanted the children not only as cheap labour but for two special reasons : their fingers were more sensitive than those of adults , so that they quickly learnt the work of " piecers " , who join the broken ends of thread , and it was easier for small bodies to worm their way under or through the machinery for cleaning it . There was also , alas ! the advantage of their comparative docility . Adults , as we have previously noticed , resented the regular hours and controlled activities of factory work and were less in awe of the foreman or manager . Children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under any other conditions , would accept factory rules without much audible protest , and if they broke them could easily be punished . The work was not always exacting . Michael Armstrong the Factory Boy and his friends are not pictured in a scene of unending labour , and in real life we know how , in the Lanarkshire of the 1820 's , young David Livingstone learnt his Latin grammar for college from a book propped up against the machines . But the hours were very long ? often twelve hours a day and not infrequently more ? and the conditions ( heat , noise , dust , and unfenced machinery ) often led to children becoming sickly and their bodies stunted . It is not a proud memory that the wealth of early nineteenth-century Britain was built on such a foundation ; but before we condemn the factory-owners too sweepingly we should remember that child labour was nothing new ? it was , for instance , a prominent feature of the woollen industry when Defoe was on his tour , long before the factories began . We ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was led by other children in the time of the early factories .  | Education Only a minority of children attended school at all regularly , even if they were not otherwise employed . There was often a primitive Dame 's School , to which the very small ones were sent at a trifling fee , to keep them quiet rather than to learn , and since 1782 Sunday Schools ( popularized by Robert Raikes of Gloucester ) had been available . These concentrated on teaching their pupils how to read the Bible and were supported by the Churches : having learnt to read the Bible , the ex-Sunday School scholar of course had the ability to read in general , but at the rate of one lesson a week progress was extremely slow . In some fortunate neighbourhoods there was a Charity School , probably dating from the reign of Queen Anne , or there might be one of the new National Schools attached to the parish church ? the National Society had been founded in 1811 to promote education in Church principles ? or a school belonging to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 1808 . These schools would teach the three R 's after a fashion , but attendance at them did not often lead on to the Grammar School , which commonly required the payment of fees and was in practice reserved for the sons of the middle and upper classes . For girls there were no grammar schools and very little education of any kind . To complete our list , we must mention the half-dozen great Public Schools , like Eton , Westminster , and Harrow , though they were far out of reach of the ordinary people we are thinking of . But even there the life was hard , the teaching harsh , and the curriculum narrow ? six hours of Latin and Greek six days a week , with the Greek Testament for a change on the seventh ? from which we can judge what it was like at less favoured schools . The latest method of teaching for the masses , thought to be a labour-saving device as valuable as the spinning inventions , was styled the " Monitorial System " . Each lesson was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older pupils ; when they knew it by heart , the school was to be divided into classes , each of which would learn the same lesson from one of the older pupils or " Monitors " ; in this way a single master , it was claimed , could teach a school of almost unlimited size . We can only guess at the  | means employed to keep order and secure results by this system ! Most children worked , as a matter of course , if their parents could hear of any work that they could do . Parents as a whole did not resist the employment of their children in factories , not only because they needed the additional earnings but because factory work was not necessarily the worst work . Apprentices in shops and handicrafts might have a kind master ; on the other hand , they might be treated more inhumanly than by an overseer in a factory , whose activities were in public . Life on the farm , which often gave employment in bird-scaring to children who were only just old enough to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bustle of the factory . Worst of all , perhaps , was the work in the galleries of the coal-mines , where the smallest children sat alone in the dark to open and shut the ventilation doors , while bigger ones dragged the trucks of coal with bent backs or even on all-fours along low passages . Work Done by Women Women also were employed to haul or carry coal between the face , where the miner worked with his pick , and the more or less distant pithead of the primitive collieries ; they were employed in far greater numbers in the cotton-spinning mills . It was not a new thing , though a bad thing , for them to do heavy industrial work : we have referred before to the nail- and chain-making of the Black Country , in which women had for centuries been prominent . Indeed , it is a remarkable fact that in the case of the well-to-do merchant class the Industrial Revolution had the opposite effect . In the old days , when the master-craftsman or shopkeeper usually had his home above his place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work that was going on ; many a widow ran a business with success until her sons were old enough to take over . But with the growth of factories and factory towns , it became usual for the successful factory-owner to live in some select residential quarter remote from the factory , and it became a mark of his success that his wife and daughters lived in ignorance of his business or of any other business : their idleness advertised his wealth . The more energetic and adventurous women of this class  | looked with secret envy upon the comparative freedom of the milllassie in shawl and clogs . The Industrial Revolution gave two benefits to working women . Firstly , by transferring the place of work from the home to the factory it made it possible for the home to be kept tidier , healthier and more private . How encumbered a cottage must have been in the old days when it contained spinning-wheel , weaver 's loom , wool that was being prepared for use , unspun rovings , unwoven yarn , raw material just arrived from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for return to him ! Secondly , the regular if small wage , earned in the factory and paid direct to the person who  | earned it , gave women their first chance to be independent of father or husband . Of course , the wage of the unmarried daughter or the wife who kept on at the factory ( the usual practice in the cotton towns ) might all be needed to support the home , but what was earned was indisputably hers . There might have been a third benefit . In theory , the factory system gave women workers the same chance as men now had of securing better wages and conditions by forming trade unions , when they had become legal again in 1824 ? 5 after a quarter of a century of suppression . But women , it must be confessed , showed little readiness to give time or money or interest to organizing in their own defence , even where ? as in the coal-mines ? they were given degrading work to do , of a kind unsuitable to their sex . Shaftesbury , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efforts of the early trade unions as the devoted work of a great Tory nobleman and Evangelical religious leader , the 7th Earl of Shaftesbury ( 1801 ? 85 ) , which ended the gravest evils . As Lord Ashley he sat in the House of Commons for a quarter of a century ( 1826 ? 51 ) , and it was during this period chiefly that his campaigns on behalf of women and child workers established a higher standard than had existed before the Industrial Revolution . This last fact is clearly shown in his much longer struggle on behalf of the " climbing boys " , exposed to death or injury inside the twisting chimneys of the big houses they were sent to clean , for this terrible practice dated from the earlier part of the eighteenth century . Not only did it arise before the worst evils of the new industrialism ; it also outlasted them . Public sympathy was first claimed for these hapless children , who were employed as small and therefore as young as possible , by the eighteenth-century philanthropist , Hanway , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1789 : When my mother died I was very young , And my father sold me , while yet my tongue Could scarcely cry " ' Weep !

Oliver Twist , it will be remembered , narrowly escaped being bound apprentice to a sweep ? and figures prominently in Charles Kingsley 's Water Babies in 1863 . Not until 1875 did Lord Shaftesbury finally triumph over custom and supposed convenience . Nearly all the philanthropic works , which still cause Shaftesbury 's portrait ( here reproduced ) to be among the select few that mean something to the average visitor when he sees it at the National Portrait Gallery , belong to a period a little later than that which we are now considering . But it seems appropriate to end this chapter with his great reforms ; for the struggle for the Factory Acts marks the transition to the less inhumane Victorian era . The Struggle for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring about improved conditions in the factories , and the method was by getting Parliament to pass Acts which would prohibit the worst practices . To us to-day it seems obvious that such regulations should exist , but at the time people did not look at things in the same way . To begin with , very often the facts were not known , at least until government commissions were appointed to investigate and report . Many of the manufacturers held that Factory Acts would be an interference with private property and free enterprise . They argued also that they would increase their costs . And to increase costs would lead to a fall in sales and profits which would bring unemployment and so , instead of helping the workers , would do  | them harm . The manufacturers , without being deliberately cruel , wished to get their labour as cheaply as possible . At the same time , where self-interest is involved , people are easily led to ignore suffering and cruelty . From time to time there was a demand for reform . In 1802 the Health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations made by the better Manchester millowners , including the elder Sir Robert Peel . The Act , as has been noticed already , fixed the maximum working day for apprentices at twelve hours , and forbade their working at night . In addition , factories were to be properly ventilated and whitewashed . Apprentices were to have better clothes and sleeping accommodation , and were to be given a little elementary education . The J.P.s were to enforce the provisions of the Act , and to send visitors to the factories . But the Act had little practical effect . The J.P.s were often friends of the local manufacturers , and did not enforce the law properly . It was possible also to evade the Act , which applied only to apprentices , by engaging unapprenticed paupers for a term of years ? and other children were now readily available . Meanwhile one important factory-owner , Robert Owen , had shown in his New Lanark mills that it was possible to improve factory conditions and make the mills pay at the same time , and he tried to convince other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the factory system . Another Act was passed in 1819 , applying to cotton factories only , which forbade the employment of a child under nine . Once more , however , there was little result ; there was still no adequate inspection , and the age of children employed might be unknown or concealed . But the early 1830 's were an age of reform of many kinds , and by this time factory reform in particular mustered a number of energetic supporters . Though Robert Owen had sold his factories and was engrossed in trade unionism , his place as leader was taken by Ashley ( the future Lord Shaftesbury ) , and he acted in association with men who represented many different political , religious and social groupings . The best-remembered perhaps is John Fielden , Quaker and Radical M.P. , whose spinning factories at Todmorden , Yorkshire , were among the largest works in the  | world . To him fell the honour of carrying the Ten Hours Bill in 1847 , when Lord Ashley had temporarily vacated his seat in the Commons . Others were John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Tory land agent , who stirred men 's consciences by letters headed " Yorkshire Slavery " , which he wrote to the Leeds Mercury in 1830 ; and Michael Sadler , an importer of Irish linen and Fellow of the Royal Society . There was strong agitation in favour of reform , inside Parliament and outside . Parliament set up a committee to make inquiries , and Ashley pressed for real reform . As a result the Factory Act of 1833 was passed , the first really effective Factory Act , often known as Althorp 's Act from the name of the leader of the House of Commons who sponsored it in its final form . It applied to all textile factories ? not only to cotton , like the Act of 1819 . No child under nine was to work in a mill ; children under thirteen were restricted to a nine-hour day ; and young persons of thirteen to eighteen were restricted to a twelve-hour day . The most important feature of the Act was that it was to be enforced by the first salaried inspectors . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law was obeyed in the factories , and they largely succeeded . The Act also provided for two hours ' schooling a day for each child-worker under thirteen ? though what the sense of this was it is difficult to see . The children were at work while the schools were open , even if there were schools nearby ; the factory-owners were not likely to be helpful in providing schools or teachers ; and nine hours ' work plus two hours ' schooling made the children not much better off than before . Further Factory Legislation Nothing had been done so far to limit directly the hours of adult workers , and therefore the struggle had still to go on for a shorter working day and also for greater safety and better conditions in both factories and mines . Lord Ashley carried on his noble work of pressing for reform . A Royal Commission brought to light some of the horrors of the mines , and in 1842 Parliament passed the Mines Act . This prohibited the employment underground of women and girls , and of boys under ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " under thirteen " . Fifteen was at the same time made the minimum age for the highly responsible work of an engineman in charge of the winding apparatus on the surface . It required another Act in 1850 properly to establish inspectors of mines ; they had been included in Ashley 's Bill in 1842 , but their powers were whittled away by the House of Lords . The Factory Act of 1844 made an important step forward . Women were classed as " young persons " and so their working day was restricted to twelve hours . Children 's hours were reduced to six and a half and more practical provision made for education . Very important , in this Act , was the provision for fencing machinery . Unfenced machinery , and also the practice of cleaning machinery while in motion , had caused many accidents . Women 's hair and clothing were liable to catch in the machines , causing serious injury . The Act of 1844 made the fencing of machinery compulsory , and in this way it also protected adult men ; in addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning and shifting machinery while it was in motion . Three years later the Factory Act of 1847 was passed . At last the provision of a ten-hour day for women and young persons became law . Ashley had long worked for this , and had hoped that it might also restrict the hours of men , because it was difficult to keep the factories working with the labour of men only . But some employers still found means , by working women and young persons in shorter shifts , to work the men for as long as fifteen hours a day , and two more laws were required , in 1850 and 1853 , to establish the principle that factories might only be open to women and young persons for twelve hours daily ( 8 on Saturdays ) , within which they might work a 102-hour day ( 72 on Saturdays ) . The extra half-hour remained until 1874 , but adult male workers were more interested in the fact that their own hours were now indirectly but effectively restricted ? a change which marks the beginning of the transition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the heroic labours of Lord Shaftesbury .  | BRITAIN AFTER WATERLOO  --  THE NEW SOCIETY The growth and misgrowth of industrial towns and the hardships , slowly surmounted , of the industrial life of women and child workers are characteristic features of the first half of the nineteenth century in its entirety . But the period just after the close of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 was also darkened for contemporaries by special problems , which we can now understand more easily in the light of two later post-war eras . War in this case had given an intermittent stimulus to industry ? the " false and bloated prosperity " , as the journalist William Cobbett called it ; there had been heavy demand for arms , cloth and leather for the armies . Now slump followed . Factories and plants were now too big for peace-time needs ; capital could not be used , profits fell , and employment fell also . Iron-workers , gunmakers , clothiers and food contractors all suffered . At the same time men came back from the Army and Navy ; half a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was contracting . War had helped British farmers . British agriculture had had a virtual monopoly , for war had shut out supplies of foreign corn . As population was increasing at the same time , there was a greatly increased demand for bread which led to high prices for wheat . As a result new land was ploughed , marsh and waste were reclaimed , enclosure was pressed on . When peace came , foreign corn was again available , and prices fell . Tenants could not pay their rents , poorer land went out of use , agricultural wages and employment were reduced . It was to give landlords and farmers a measure of protection that the Corn Law was passed in 1815 . But this , by raising the price of bread , hit at the factory workers and the unemployed . Apart from a protective measure of this kind , govern- meats at the time had little understanding of economics , and had no means of dealing with the economic problems facing the country . The general policy was to let things alone , a policy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post ? war Distress Consequently , there was unrest and disturbance . We have already mentioned the machine-breaking activities of the Luddites in 1811 ? 12 ; these were revived in 1815=16 . Other rather similar outbursts of popular discontent occurred in places as widely separated as London ( Spa Fields riot ) and Scotland ( the so-called Battle of Bonnymuir ) , though the most dramatic episode , the one  | which created most stir at the time and is best remembered now , was the " Peterloo massacre " in August 1819 at Manchester . On that occasion a squadron of Hussars , riding in to break up a huge but peaceful demonstration of workers , caused eleven deaths and about 500 injuries to the panic-stricken crowd . These casualties , which deeply impressed the public mind , were at least inflicted in hot blood . When the farm labourers of southern England demonstrated in the winter of 1830 ? 31 against threshing machines and starvation wages ( between which they saw a connection ) , His Majesty 's judges sent three to the gallows and 420 to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? unemployment , low wages , the high price of bread , unfair taxation , the need for parliamentary reform ? to which we might add the underlying resentment against the whole nature of factory work and all the miseries of life in the industrial town . Hand-loom weavers vainly struggling to compete with machinery ; workers who found themselves " stood off " by some sudden slump in an export trade ; and to a small extent all the people who were trying to fit in to the new industries and the life of the new towns were the victims of that change from the old to the new . But we may pause here to remind ourselves by a brief survey that this was also an age of energy and progress . Agriculture and Industry First , the methods of agriculture were greatly improved . George III , " Farmer George " , and the great landowners had been united in their zeal for agriculture . The enthusiasm which animated members of the Board of Agriculture and others was voiced by Sir John Sinclair in 1803 . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against a foreign country ( France ) . . . let us not be satisfied with the liberation of Egypt , or the subjugation of Malta , but let us subdue Finchley Common ; let us conquer Hounslow Heath ; let us compel Epping Forest to submit to the yoke of Improvement . " In 1815 there were two centres of progress in agriculture . First , there was " old England " , the eastern counties ? Essex , Suffolk and Norfolk , with Hertfordshire and Leices- tershire . The second centre of successful farming was in the Lowlands of Scotland . The farms of East Lothian were among the best managed in Britain , and on them new methods of breeding and cultivation had been quickly adopted or in some cases invented . In 1815 some people were already viewing with concern the growth in the number of persons employed in industry and commerce . Accurate measurement of change was now for the first time possible , as the first census taken in 1801 was to be repeated at ten-year intervals . In 1811 , 6,129,000 persons depended upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigation and manufacture . Agriculture and mining produced a revenue of ? 107,246,000 ; commerce , navigation and manufacture produced ? 183,908,000 . Was it wise , men asked , to sacrifice agriculture to industry , for England to become like Tyre of old and Venice in the Middle Ages , a purely commercial and industrial state dependent on other countries for her bread and meat ? The coal-mines grew in importance year by year . Gas-lighting , for instance , started about the end of the war in London and other large towns , and by 1837 an ancient export trade in coal had risen to a million tons a year . On account of the demands of the Army and the Navy , the iron industry had been prosperous during the quarter of a century before 1815 . The price of iron had been rising , and wages had also been increased . The restoration of peace in 1815 caused a sudden drop in demand , but soon iron exports , particularly to America , were rising more rapidly than any others . Many small masters shared in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then towns of small workshops rather than large factories , Sheffield dealing in cutlery , Birmingham in machinery , hardware , and a great number of small articles . The largest factories in Birmingham represented a capital of ? 6,000 to ? 8,000 , but the majority had a capital of less than ? 1,000 . In the textile industry , the woollen trade , which had long been the chief source of England 's industrial wealth , now occupied second place , having been overtaken by cotton . In 1815 it was estimated that the profits from the cotton manufacture amounted to ? 23 million , while those of the woollen industry were only ? 18 million . Machinery driven by water power or steam was coming into general use in the cotton factories for spinning the yarn ,  | and for finishing processes . All this pointed to future prosperity . Hand-loom Weavers But power-looms made slow progress ; in 1823 the number of steam-looms in the whole country was apparently not much above 10,000 . This was enough , however , to force down the earnings of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest and poorest classes of the industrial population . They were about a million in number , including some who were reluctant to change from a job which had at one time given them good earnings and an independent way of life . But there were many more who could find no other job . It should be noted that these handweavers no longer included any large proportion of part-time farmers , for the loss of their " strips " had driven many of these to move to the industrial districts , where the women and children could find work in the mills while the men worked at home . The hand-weavers were to be found in the silk industry of Spitalfields and Macclesfield , and in all the woollen-weaving districts from Glasgow to Norfolk , and from the West Riding of Yorkshire to the south-western counties of Gloucester , Somerset , and Wiltshire . Their desperate struggle to stave off the introduction of the machine by cutting the price of handwork continued in out-of-the-way places until some time in the second half of the nineteenth century . Improvements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With better roads , there was great rivalry between various coach services . Newspapers viewed with concern the racing between drivers of stage coaches . In 1815 Edinburgh was only sixty hours ' coach journey from London ; in the middle of the eighteenth century , the journey had taken from ten to fourteen days . Steam power had already been applied , as we know , to navigation in river estuaries and canals . The Calais packets began to ply in 1821 , and in 1824 the holiday-steamers which made the fortunes of Margate and Ramsgate : regular Atlantic crossings by steamer date from the ' forties . A start had also been made with the  | application of steam power to the work of propelling a locomotive , The first " iron-horse " or steam carriage was made in 1801 by Richard Trevithick , a Cornishman ; in 1804 his road locomotive ran adventurously through the London streets to Paddington and Islington . A number of steam coaches made a brief appearance on the roads during the next twenty or thirty years ; but the future lay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made an engine , named Bli , ' rcher after the famous Prussian general who was shortly to fight at the side of the British against Napoleon . This engine drew coal trucks , not passengers ? but the coming of the railway brings us to the Victorian Age . Enough has been said to show that the era of Waterloo , marked by economic distress , is also marked by economic progress . Similarly , while this was a period in which appalling slums were being created , so that the horrors of Manchester , Liverpool , Birmingham , and Glasgow rivalled the horrors which had existed in East London for a century or more , it was also a period of important social advances . Social Progress London , for instance , was beautified by the great building schemes of the Prince Regent 's architect , John Nash ; he designed the processional way from his master 's residence at Carlton House ( where Carlton House Terrace stands now ) up Regent Street and Portland Place to the great terraces at Regent 's Park . This is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new aristocratic quarter for the world 's wealthiest capital . The middle class in London and the provinces were housed in villas of little or no architectural merit , but it was a most important aspect of the change from old to new that they were increasing rapidly in numbers and influence . Merchants and bankers ; the new factoryowners ; the old profession of the law and the new profession of engineering ? all these were beginning to have a new sense of their own importance , even in comparison with the landed magnates who had ruled Britain for five generations , unchallenged since 1688 . After 1815 the men of influence in politics included Peel , the son of a successful cotton-spinner ; Canning and Huskisson , men  | of middle-class origins who represented commercial interests as successive Members of Parliament for Liverpool ; and Brougham , a self-made Scottish lawyer with a special interest in the reform of education . In 1828 Brougham helped to found London University ; the improvements which began about the same time at Oxford and Cambridge are another mark of the rise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible to generalize . It is not enough to say that the purchasing-power of their wages was on the whole greater than before the French Wars , though this fact is sufficiently important to bear repeating . For we can not estimate with any accuracy what proportion of individuals or families gained less by the better wage rates than they lost through periods of unemployment . Nor is it satisfactory to point to the increased chances of self-improvement which the industrial towns offered , though it was obviously easier than before to change one 's job for the better . By 1825 all the bigger towns had Mechanics ' Institutes , with lectures and library , and in that year a Society for the Diffusion  | of Useful Knowledge was set up to provide cheap books for the ambitious worker ? all this by voluntary effort . But we have to admit that there may have been very many workers whose only ambition was to be allowed to return from the rush and din and ugliness of the new town to the simpler , slower life they had left behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last type was William Cobbett ( 1762-1835 ) , the self-educated son of a poor farm-labourer , who became soldier , farmer , politician , and journalist ? but it is as a journalist that he is still remembered . In his Rural Rides , which were written in the 1820 's as a series of diary items for his paper , the Political Register , Cobbett is never tired of praising country life in the good old days , before London became the " Great Wen " and the nation fell into the power of bankers , stock jobbers , and all the many new types which he heartily disliked and denounced . Cobbett wrote so well that his opinions still colour our picture of the age . But perhaps we get a truer picture from the career of a man like Robert Owen ( 1771-1858 ) , a penniless shop assistant  | from Newtown in far-off Montgomeryshire , who became one of the chief factory-owners of the day . Having made a fortune in a few years at his New Lanark mills ( near Glasgow ) , he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions for his workpeople and their families , but of the co-operative movement , national trade unions , socialism , and other new ideas which grew out of the industrial changes . And , finally , Cobbett 's outlook is certainly less representative than that of George Stephenson , the wholly uneducated son of a colliery fireman ? he was seventeen before he learnt to read ? to whom the Industrial Revolution gave the chance to develop the locomotive engine and plan the railways . The Stockton and Darlington railway , with which so much of our modern civilization begins , was being opened at the very time when Cobbett was riding through the country and saying that every change he saw was a change for the worse . '  | THE COMING OF THE RAILWAYS QUEEN VICTORIA had been on the throne for rather more than a year when the first of the main line railways existing to-day was opened from London to Birmingham in September 1838 . In the course of her reign , and chiefly in the first half of it , the network spread throughout Britain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for passengers and goods alike ? much quicker than the canal , much cheaper and easier and quicker than travel by road . Not only so , but the building of railways in foreign countries , in the Empire , and in India , became one of our most valuable export industries : the rails , the engines and carriages , and the skilled labour for making the permanent way ? all these came from Britain and were an advertisement of our industrial leadership . By the time of the great Queen 's death in 1901 , railways had spread to most civilized countries , but the British railway system was so complete , well built , and efficient that we still retained an advantage over our rivals in the ease with which raw materials , coal , foodstuffs , and finished goods could be moved about the country . Even to-day the railway viaducts and bridges and some of the big railway stations , like Euston with its classical entrance or the huge vault of St. Pancras , are regarded by many as the best type of architecture of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may well make the railway the starting-point for our study of the period of Britain 's greatest power and prosperity and selfsatisfaction , which we call " Victorian " .  | The railway resulted from a combination of two ideas ? the mounting of a steam engine on a carriage so as to use its power to propel that and other attached carriages ; and the propulsion of the carriages along a track made of parallel lines . We have already mentioned Trevithick 's locomotive , which ran along the road in Cornwall and in London . Primitive railways , made at first of wooden planks , were then already a fairly common device for moving heavy material in mines or quarries , and on Tyneside and in South Wales iron railways often ran from the collieries down to the canal or river : the standard gauge of British Railways to-day reproduces what was found to be a convenient width for these early coal-trucks . It was in South Wales in 1804 that Trevithick 's locomotive was put on to a railway , and in Northumberland in 1813 that William Hedley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , is a very clumsy machine , but it is evidently intended to draw other wagons along an iron railway , though the smallness  | of the flange on the inner edge of the wheels suggests that its speed would be extremely slow . Puffing Billy attracted the attention of George Stephenson , the engine-wright at Killingworth , a neighbouring colliery , and in 1814 he built his Blucher on the same general plan ; but it was so much better that it could draw no fewer than eight trucks containing thirty tons of coal along the level and even up slight slopes at a speed of about nine miles an hour . The Stockton-Darlington Railway Eight years later , a railway for goods traffic was being planned between the towns of Darlington and Stockton-on-Tees . It was first intended to use horse-drawn trucks , but Stephenson suggested that steam locomotives should be used , and he was appointed to carry out the work . He built another engine , the Locomotion , and this drew a train of trucks at a speed of twelve miles an hour when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first many people thought it would be unsafe to travel in a train drawn by a steam engine ? the engine might blow up , or the train catch fire . But before long , the merchants of Liverpool and Manchester decided to have a railway between their two towns , and Stephenson carried out the work . The directors ' prize for the best locomotive was won by Stephenson 's famous Rocket , which travelled at the rate of twenty-nine miles an hour . The Liverpool and Manchester Railway , opened in 1830 , ran passenger trains as well as goods trains . In 1831 , over 256,000 people travelled by train in six months , although the total length of the railways was only sixty-nine miles . In 1836-37 there was a short-lived " boom " in railway construction , which provided more capital for two big schemes already under way for lines connecting London with Birmingham and Bristol , and the first of the big London stations was opened , Euston . Of course , railway travel to begin with was by no means comfortable . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diarist Charles Greville , when travelling from Birmingham to Liverpool in four and a half hours , found nothing disagreeable about it except the whiffs of stinking air . " Town after town , one park and country house after another , are left behind with the  | rapid variety of a panorama . The most surprising feature of all , apart from the speed , was the wonderful punctuality . It gave to man something of the precision of a machine . " Greville also notes that " one engineer " , on that journey in the first year of Victoria 's reign , reached the astonishing speed of forty-five miles an hour , and that he was promptly dismissed by a prudent company running no risks . In a leaflet , Rules for Railway Travelling , some amusing advice is given : " If a second-class carriage , as sometimes happens , has no door , passengers should take care not to put out their legs . " " Beware of yielding to the sudden impulse to spring from the carriage to recover your hat which has blown off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At first some of the older and more select towns petitioned Parliament to keep the " new fangled notion outside their boundaries " . Other people asked what would become of coach-makers , harness-makers , coach-masters and coachmen , inn-keepers , horsebreeders , and horse-dealers if the railways were allowed to take the place of travel by coach . Many landowners tried to prevent railways being taken through their estates , and when they had to sell the land to the railway company , they made them pay very high prices . But the early fears of the new means of travel died down , and the rapid development of passenger traffic proved even more important than the carriage of goods . Construction of Main Lines Then came the great " railway mania " , following nearly ten years after the first boom and marked by great schemes for amalgama-  | and drawn by Jupiter ( manufactured by Robert Stephenson and Co. of Trade that " Six-wheel engines and carriages are much safer and rs than four " . tions as well as for new lines , with huge investments by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The leading spirit was George Hudson ( 1800 ? 71 ) , the " Railway King " , a York draper who organized the Midland Railway Company , with its headquarters at Derby , and other shorter-lived combinations . In 1847 the bubble burst ; Hudson and many other people were ruined ; and he was accused ( but not convicted ) of fraud . But railways , like the habit of Stock Exchange speculation , had come to stay , and between 1848 and 1870 the railway mileage in Britain increased from 4,600 to 13,600 miles . The chief lines in this country were constructed between 1833 and 1862 , and most of them were planned by George Stephenson ( 1781 ? 1848 ) or his son Robert Stephenson ( 1803 ? 59 ) . The latter was engineer for the London to Birmingham line , which was built by 20,000 men in five years . His other achievements included the high-level bridge over the Tyne at Newcastle and the Britannia tubular bridge at the Menai Straits . Another of the famous railway pioneers was Isambard Kingdom Brunel ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frenchman . In 1838 ? 41 he built the main line from London to Bristol , with its tunnels and bridges . The long Box Tunnel between Chippenham and Bath set a particularly hard problem for him to solve , as water gushed out freely through crevices in the rock . Brunel was also prominent as the great advocate of the seven-foot broad gauge ' , which the Great Western Railway did not finally abandon until 1892 . His last great railway undertaking was the Royal Albert Bridge at Saltash , to carry the first lines into Cornwall . The Brunels , father and son , were outstanding practical engineers and their careers illustrate how in those days able men  | learnt their jobs by doing them , that is by practical experience rather than by specific training in a technical college . Their careers also show that jobs were less specialized than they are to-day and consequently a clever man might turn his hand to several different occupations in one lifetime . The father , Marc I. Brunel , served in the French navy but fled during the Revolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . Then he came to England and was active as inventor and engineer . He invented certain machine tools , machinery for sawmills , and a stocking frame , and he drew plans for bridges in this country and abroad , and constructed the first tunnel under the Thames . His son , after going to school in Paris , learnt his job as an engineer in his father 's office and in working on the Thames tunnel . Apart from his achievements as a railway engineer , he designed at the age of twenty-five Clifton suspension bridge . Later he designed three famous ships . The Great Western was the first steamship built for the Atlantic crossing ; the Great Britain was the first large ship with a screw-propeller ; the Great Eastern held the world record for size ? and , alas ! uselessness ? for nearly half a century . Brunel also designed a number of docks , piers and buildings . And he was a strong supporter of the Great Exhibition of 1851 . Such men were the planners and pioneers of the railway age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be remembered . It demanded great physical strength and powers of endurance . It was sometimes dangerous , especially when tunnels had to be blasted , often with insufficient safety devices . But it was comparatively well paid and attracted labourers from country places , especially districts where main lines were being constructed , of whom a large proportion eventually settled in the towns . A great many navvies came also from Ireland . Although the express services between principal towns soon reached high speeds , comparable with some twentieth-century services , it took years of practice before local trains ran to time as often as they do now . Another problem for the early railway companies was the method of signalling . The electric telegraph , first patented in 1837 , did more than any other device to ensure safety , railway companies being the first organizations to make practical use of this great invention : by 1848 , 1,300 miles of telegraph wires  | had been set up along railway tracks . The telegraph could be used to send messages to advise station-masters of the approach of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . But a better method of signalling to engine-drivers was needed . In due course the system of " distant " and " near " signals , operated by wires from a signalbox , was worked out , the intervening space being sufficient for the train to come to a halt at the second signal . Further Development of Railways In the second half of the nineteenth century more spectacular works were undertaken than had yet been known . Two of the greatest were the Severn Tunnel and the Forth Bridge , both of which took years to build . They were under construction at the same time . The Severn Tunnel , 42 miles in length , by taking the railway under the river greatly shortened travel between South Wales and the West of England . In 1886 the first train ran through the tunnel with a load of steam coal from Aberdare to Southampton . The Forth Bridge , with piers nearly as high as St. Paul 's Cathedral , was formally opened in 1890 . It provided a direct route for the railway from Edinburgh to Dundee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between London and the north of Scotland . Gladstone , when he visited the bridge , was strong in his admiration of the work . It did indeed mark a great advance in science , engineering and industry since his early days when , as he described it himself , he had " crossed the Forth in a little bit of an open boat , tumbling about " . At first the government had left the building of a railway to unrestricted private enterprise , once the railway company had received powers from Parliament to buy the land required and to make all the other complicated financial arrangements for the work . But it was soon found necessary to pass certain Acts regulating their management . The Railway Passengers Act of 1844 required every railway to run some trains carrying third-class passengers at the rate of a penny a mile . The companies found that the third-class " parliamentary " trains , as they were called , paid best of all , and third-class carriages were placed on all trains . An Act of 1871 required Companies to notify all accidents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inquiry when an accident occurred . About this time great improvements took place in the building of carriages ; padded third-class seats , restaurant cats , and sleeping cars for night travel began to be introduced ; steel rails took the place of iron ones ; and a better braking system made travel both safer and more comfortable . Among the many small local companies which had built the railways by private enterprise a process of amalgamation went on . The Great Western Railway , for example , which had built the line from Paddington to Bristol , later took over four smaller companies which had laid down sections of line as far as Penzance . Similar amalgamations went on in other parts of the country , so that before the First World War the main railway companies were seven or eight in number . After that war , in 1921 , the number of companies was reduced to four , the G.W.R. , the L.M.S. , the L.N.E.R. , and the S.R. Since then the main event in the story of railway management has been the nationalization of the railways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a controversial political measure , and its good and bad features are still debated . The Advantages of Railways In the early days , of course , there had been considerable opposition to the railways , as there generally is to anything new . All those interested in coaches and road travel , and canals , and also country gentlemen who wished to preserve parks and country houses in peace and quiet , did what they could to oppose the coming of lines of track and steam monsters which disturbed cattle and frightened horses . Some people scoffed at the possibilities opening out ; they argued that a speed greater than that of the old stage-coach would be too dangerous , and that the new tunnels and bridges would collapse . In spite of such fears the railways grew rapidly . Fears , however , were not altogether without foundation , for there were numerous accidents and some awful disasters . Among the worst were the accident at Abergele in North Wales in 1868 , when thirty-three people perished by fire , and the collapse of the Tay Bridge in 1879 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a  | train with all its passengers were destroyed . Accidents , though frequent , did not prevent the gradual establishment of public confidence . A prominent business man , who travelled much , declared : " I have proved that railway travelling is safer than walking , riding , driving , than going up and down stairs , than watching agricultural machinery , and even safer than eating , because it is a fact that more people choke themselves in England than are killed on all the railways of the United Kingdom . " The advantages of railways were indeed to become so obvious that they came to be accepted as a matter of course . The railways had effects , direct or indirect , on almost every sphere of life . Most important were the industrial and social effects . The industrial effects of the extension of railways were farreaching . They enabled factories , wherever they were situated , to receive coal , machinery , and raw materials at cheaper rates , and to have their manufactured goods carried to all parts of the country as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standardized brick and slate to replace the use of local building materials , which were often more picturesque ; but they also enabled farmers and others to improve upon local prices for their products by sending to the big industrial towns . Again , the speed and low rates of railway transport enabled fruit , vegetables , and milk to be sent safely , and there were special trains for bringing fish from the fishing ports to inland towns . The working classes benefited in many ways : in towns , food was cheaper and more plentiful ; in the rural districts , increased production gave increased employment . There was also the speeding-up of the mails and ? in the later part of the century ? the institution of the newspaper train , which carried the London papers , for better or worse , far and wide into the provinces . The social effects of the railways , their effects on the lives of the people , were also far-reaching . In the old days people had been tied by circumstances to their village ; most were born , lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The railways made it much easier to move . Men could leave the village and seek work elsewhere , and during the Industrial Revolution and the railway age new centres of population grew up , largely aided by travel on the  | railways . This mobility contributed much to our success as an industrial nation by enabling new manufactures to grow wherever development was easiest and most profitable . In the new towns men escaped the old feudal influences of the countryside , the authority of the landlord and parson . The old class-structure was greatly weakened ; in the towns men were largely free of the old influences , and new ideas were rife . Even to-day people in the towns are usually more open to new ideas in politics and economics than people in the country . Thus railways , with the freedom of travel , facilitated Victorian liberal and reforming ideas and contributed to the growth of democracy . They also directly assisted the growth of active political life by enabling the leaders to speak at any centre of population ? even from the train itself , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the form of newspapers , pamphlets , and books , to distant parts of the country . The railways also made possible holidays by the sea or in the country . The railways opened up the Highlands of Scotland to walker and tourist , and the deer forests and moors to the wealthy and fashionable . A visit to " the seaside " became the summer holiday of millions ; places like Blackpool , Bournemouth , and Westonsuper-Mare were largely created by the railways . To all this excursion trains and cheap tickets contributed , and with them came the chance of pleasures and experiences for the masses which before had only been open to a few .  | THE COMING OF FREE TRADE IF the rapid spread of the railways was the physical change which was most typical of the Victorian age , there was an equally characteristic change in people 's ideas which showed itself in the success of the Free Trade movement . This had its roots in Adam Smith 's Wealth of Nations ( 1776 ) which said that the prosperity of a nation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most countries had ( and still have ) an extensive tariff ? a list of Customs duties which restrict the importation of foreign goods by making them more expensive . Adam Smith argued that , if there were no tariffs ( except purely for revenue ) every country would be able to sell abroad the things it produced most cheaply , and buy in return the things that it could not cheaply produce for itself . What Adam Smith advocated was the kind of policy which his first great disciple , the younger William Pitt , adopted when he became prime minister in 1783 . He tried to reduce any duty which was heavy enough to encourage smuggling : that on tea , for example , was brought down from 119 to 12+ per cent . He made a commercial treaty with France ( 1786 ) , by which each country reduced the duties levied on the principal imports coming from the other one . He also proposed , and struggled unsuccessfully for , complete free trade between the United Kingdom and Ireland . Thus Pitt 's policy was leading Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars of 1793-1815 intervened . These ended for the time being not only the treaty with France , but every project for the reduction of tariffs in the spirit of Adam Smith . The attack on the tariff was renewed by William Huskisson as President of the Board of Trade in the 1820 's . But it was not until the reign of Queen Victoria that Britain put free-trade principles systematically into practice , allowing unrestricted admission to almost all of the world 's products , and relying on the skilful manu- facture and cheapness of our own products to enable us to sell at least as much as we bought . The few duties which remained ? on tea and tobacco , for instance ? were not designed to restrict trade but as a convenient form of tax which nearly everybody would have to pay . The great trial of strength in this matter concerned the importation into Britain of cheap corn . This would lower the price of home-grown corn , to the disadvantage of landowners and farmers , but it would make wages go further ( cheap bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town workers and farm labourers . It was a problem which had already arisen in the later eighteenth century , when Britain as the result of the growth of population and industry was ceasing to be in normal years an exporter rather than an importer of corn . There were already import duties in existence to protect the landowner and farmer against the possibility of very low prices for their crops . But they were lowered or suspended if prices rose to famine levels , as they did during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars . It was to meet the post-war situation , which we have already described , that a Parliament representing chiefly the landed interest passed the drastic Corn Law of 1815 . This forbade the importation of foreign corn until British corn reached the price of 80s. a quarter , and thus the farmer was protected against foreign competition . But the law also had an adverse effect on the working population of the country . The price of the 4-lb. loaf now rose from 10d. to 14d. , although the ordinary farm labourer earned only 10-12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were riots and discontent . But it was unreasonable to blame the Corn Law for all the troubles of the time . It now seems , looking back , as if the agitation against the Corn Laws was exaggerated and as a result their evil effects were overdrawn . The price of corn at that time still depended much more on the harvest at home than on the import of corn from abroad . In years of good harvest the price was relatively low and , in spite of protection , agriculture might be distressed . In 1821 , for example , Huskisson presided over a committee of inquiry on the " depressed state of agriculture " . Huskisson himself concluded that the law failed to help the farmers , though it hampered the course of our foreign trade . In bad times , however ,  | the prohibition of imports did make it difficult to help the poor . And , as we shall see , repeal when it came did not lead to any immediate decisive fall in prices , such as its advocates had often confidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith , which had influenced the Younger Pitt to make a commercial treaty with France and generally to reduce the tariff , had rather been lost sight of in the stress of the great French wars of 1793 ? 1815 . But interest in them now revived , and not only the Corn Laws but also the old Navigation Laws were bitterly attacked . It was the advisers of King Richard II in the fourteenth century who had laid the foundations of our Mercantile policy by Navigation Acts that forbade English merchants to import or export goods except in English ships ; but the most stringent Laws belong to the time of Cromwell and the Restoration . The various Navigation Acts still in force in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries required that goods imported from America , Asia and Africa into Great Britain , Ireland , or the Colonies be carried in British-owned ships , and that goods imported from Europe be carried in British ships or in ships of the country from which the goods came . These Acts had encouraged and " protected " British shipping , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , British shipping had a practical monopoly . When peace came , other nations imposed or reimposed restrictions similar to our own . The first easing of British restrictions on shipping took place in 1814 in favour of the United States of America ; and in 1824 ? 5 a number of other treaties were made to give ships of a foreign power as good access to our ports as that particular foreign power gave for our ships to theirs . But another twenty-five years were to pass before the Navigation Acts were finally repealed . William Huskisson ( 1770 ? 1830 ) , the author of the treaties of 1824 ? 5 , although he had helped in Parliament to pass the Corn Law of 1815 , had since then gradually changed his views in the direction of freer trade . He was a man of great knowledge and experience . As a youth he had worked at the British Embassy in //  | Paris , and this training was useful to him when he came to negotiate commercial treaties with foreign countries . He was a Member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last seven years of that time he represented the commercial constituency of Liverpool . He was President of the Board of Trade from 1823 to 1827 , and that was when his chief work was done . He was held in great respect by the business and financial sections of the country , but became more and more opposed to protection for agriculture . This disagreement with the strong agricultural interests in the government led him to resign in 1828 ; two years later he was fatally injured by a locomotive at the opening of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway . Besides his revision and extensive easing of the Navigation Acts , Huskisson also strove hard after 1820 for reform of the Corn Laws ? reform , for as yet there was no talk of total repeal . Huskisson aimed at a sliding scale of duties , so arranged that the duty on foreign corn would be gradually lowered as the price of corn grown in England rose . In 1828 , after Huskisson had resigned , the government did make a law for a sliding scale , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much opposition as the original law of 1815 . In one respect , Huskisson followed a policy which would not have been approved by later free-traders . He maintained a policy of imperial preference . That is to say , he made the duties on colonial goods entering this country lower than those on foreign goods ; and , since this country still dictated policy to the colonies , he fixed colonial tariffs in such a way as to give a preference to British as against foreign imports into the colonies . During the years 1822-8 , when trade was prosperous , the government under the influence of Huskisson and the Chancellor of the Exchequer ( F. J. Robinson ) followed a general policy of reducing tariffs and internal taxes . The Chancellor 's optimistic budget speeches led people to speak of him as " Prosperity Robinson " ; various taxes were abolished or reduced , including the ancient window-tax , which Robinson halved , although this was not finally abolished until 1851 . This was the sphere of the Chancellor of the Exchequer , but Huskisson gave his attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The revision lay mainly in the reduction of import duties on raw materials and semi-finished goods . Huskisson swept away prohibitions of import and prohibitive duties , and put in their place moderate duties , setting 30 per cent of the value of the goods imported as an upper limit . Goods on which import duties were greatly reduced included copper , zinc , tin , wool , silk , and cotton . Huskisson fixed the moderate level of 30 per cent as an upper limit , because he thought that duties above that level would encourage smuggling . Previously , smuggling of goods had caused considerable losses to the revenue . When , for example , in 1823 the duties on Irish and Scotch spirits were reduced it was soon found that the revenue was greater than before , because , with the lower duty , the profit to be made from smuggling was no longer worth the risk involved . A number of export prohibitions and bounties ( i.e. sums paid by the government to encourage exports ) were likewise abolished , thus freeing outward-bound trade as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he would have permitted the free export of machinery , but this idea caused alarm in our manufacturing districts , so for the time being a licensing system was introduced . But in principle Huskisson made it possible for the foreigner to acquire both the machines and the skill for competing against British industry . Huskisson was also responsible for a codification of the customs . Over a thousand separate Acts were repealed , and the remaining laws codified . By 1826 there was a consolidated tariff system for the United Kingdom ( Great Britain and Ireland had previously had different customs duties ) . Free trade was coming about by stages . Huskisson was preparing the way for Peel , as Peel did for Gladstone . Peel and the Tariff Sir Robert Peel ( 1788-1850 ) , was the son of a wealthy cotton manufacturer . The profits his father made gave him the best education of the time , at Harrow and Christ Church , Oxford , and he devoted his great intelligence and ability to public life . His main work , so far as free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister from 1841 to 1846.  | Peel 's principle was to carry on Huskisson 's work of reducing the tariff . If trade expanded , sufficient revenue might still be obtainable from duties levied at much lower rates on a bigger turnover of goods , but as a temporary measure Peel revived a tax of the war period ? which has grown and continued ever since . Thus in 1842 an income-tax at 7d. in the ? on all incomes over ? 150 was introduced , and Peel proceeded to the reduction of tariffs . He divided imports roughly into three classes : raw materials were to pay least , up to 5 per cent ; partly manufactured goods were to pay more , up to 12 per cent ; fully manufactured goods paid the highest rates , up to 20 per cent ? although this compared well with Huskisson 's 30 per cent . In 1843 the export of machinery was freed . In 1844 the remaining export and import duties on raw wool were abolished . In 1845 most raw materials were admitted free ; in the next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also admitted free . The year 1846 also saw the reduction of duties on sugar , cheese and butter , and the abolition of those on live stock , meat and potatoes . The Anti-Corn Law League But the last stronghold of protection ? the Corn Laws ? remained , in spite of many proposals made to the government for their repeal . In 1839 the Anti-Corn Law League was founded in Manchester . The agitation against the Corn Laws was essentially a movement of the new manufacturing interest , which the Industrial Revolution had created , against the older agricultural interest striving to maintain its privileged position . Thus the League attacked the landlords as the one beneficiary from the Laws and maintained that they were standing in the way of industrial progress . It was argued that our export trade was hampered because we would not accept foreign corn in payment for our manufactured goods . It was also suggested that if foreign countries were not able to use their surplus corn in this way , they would take to manufacturing for their own needs , to the detriment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industrial employing class . To the wage earners it was pointed out that the Corn Laws were there for the purpose of raising the price of corn ,  | and that their repeal would mean cheaper bread , and this argument attracted numerous working men from the ranks of the Chartists . Richard Cobden and John Bright were the chief supporters of the League . Richard Cobden ( 1804-65 ) , the son of a poor Sussex farmer , started his business life as a clerk ; he later set up on his own account in Manchester as a calico merchant and manufacturer . He found time to remedy the weaknesses in his education , studied economics , and became an advocate of free trade . John Bright ( 1811 ? 89 ) was a Rochdale cotton manufacturer and a wonderful orator . The League sent out numerous speakers , including Bright and Cobden , to address meetings in the chief towns . The new railways , spreading over the country , were a great boon to the organizers , carrying the lecturers on their tours . At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one penny made cheaper newspapers possible , and enabled the League to spread a strong Free Trade propaganda . " Honest Hodge " , it has been said , found tracts in his village inn and learned to spell the big word " MONOPOLY " . Not less important was the introduction of the Penny Post in 1840 , which helped the League to shower anti-corn law literature on the towns and villages of England . Cobden entered Parliament as member for Stockport in 1841 , and set to work to form a party of Anti-Corn Law Leaguers among M.P . ' s . Bright became M.P . for Durham three years later ; he was a Quaker and he regarded his political activities as part of his religious duties . In spite of all this activity , however , a motion for free trade was defeated in Parliament . Repeal But in the autumn of 1845 , an unexpected ally came to the aid of the Leaguers . After several good seasons , it was a year of exceptionally heavy rain . In England , the wheat crop was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasants ' chief food , failed , and the people there were faced with famine . " Famine , against which we have warred , joined us , " said John Bright . " It was the rain , " writes Lord Morley in his Life of Cobden , " that rained away the  | Corn Laws . " It was impossible to refuse help to the starving Irish peasantry ; England was also short of food ; only an abundance of cheap corn from abroad could bring relief . The Prime Minister , Sir Robert Peel , wished to open the ports to foreign corn , but his Cabinet was divided in opinion , so he resigned . Lord John Russell , the leader of the Whig opposition , failed to form a new government to take his place , and Peel came back to office . He was now completely converted to Free Trade by the potato famine in Ireland , the threat of famine in England , and the outcry of public opinion led by the Anti-Corn Law League . " It was the rotten potatoes that put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Wellington . But when Peel was convinced as to the right step to take , he took it even though it practically ended his political career . In spite of bitter attacks , Peel succeeded , in June 1846 , in passing the Bill to repeal the Corn Laws . All that was left was a maximum tariff of 10s. a quarter for the first three years ( 1846-9 ) . The effect of the repeal ? of free trade in corn ? was nowhere so  | disastrous as the landowners and farmers had predicted . The average price of corn in the following twenty years was 52s. a quarter , which had also been the average for the five years before repeal . The difference in the situation , a difference which did no harm to farmers , was that the industrial workers were now prospering and had more money , so they bought more . Imports from abroad increased : but it was not until the 1870 's that the United States and Canada began to grow and export corn in large quantities at a price with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result came which Peel 's opponents had prophesied ? the fall of rents and profits , the ruin of farmers , and the depopulation of the countryside . As we shall see , it took two world wars to set British farming on its feet again . On the very day on which the repeal of the Corn Laws was finally accepted by the House of Commons , Peel was outvoted on another matter , and his government came to an end . In his resignation speech , he said : " It may be that I shall leave a name sometimes remembered with expressions of good will in the abodes of those whose lot it is to labour and earn their daily bread by the sweat of their brow , when they shall recruit their strength with abundant and untaxed food ? the sweeter because it is no longer leavened by a sense of injustice . " Triumph of Free Trade In 1849 , three years after the repeal of the corn laws , the Navigation Acts were also abolished after a long and bitter struggle in Parliament , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ships of all the world . The ship-owners declared this would be the ruin of British shipping ; but the quarter of a century following the repeal of the Navigation Acts was one of the greatest periods of expansion in the history of British shipping . As freight charges were now necessarily competitive , this is another case where the withdrawal of protection proved to be an all-round advantage . Thus the Great Exhibition of 1851 was meant to demonstrate the merits of our free trade system , as well as of our other freedoms , to the outside world . The scene at the opening ceremony is worth looking at . It gives something of the atmosphere  | of an aristocratic society long past ; there is the group composed of the Queen , a regal figure in pink and gold brocade , her young children , and ladies of the Court ; we see the marvel of the Hyde Park trees growing inside the crystal palace and providing the reason for its imposing height ; but above all , this famous scene marks the moment when Viztorian Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peel had died from an accident in 1850 , but the most brilliant of his followers , W. E. Gladstone ( 1809 ? 98 ) took up his work , and as Chancellor of the Exchequer in a series of great budgets used all his skill to reduce import duties to the absolute minimum , that is , to what was needed for revenue . When Peel opened his attack on customs duties in 1842 some 1,052 articles had been subject to duty ; in 1853 Gladstone still found 466 taxed articles , and by his budget of that year reduced the number ; in 1860 he found 419 and reduced them to 48 . Only 15 of these were of importance ,  | including the duties on spirits , sugar , tea , tobacco , coffee , wine and timber . Gladstone abolished the timber duty in 1866 , and took the first steps with regard to sugar , that duty being abolished by his successor in 1874 . When in 1860 Cobden had negotiated a commercial treaty with France , so that both countries made certain tariff reductions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look as if Adam Smith 's views might prevail and all Europe , or even the whole world , exchange its goods freely on free trade principles . The immediate effect of the treaty was to double the export of British manufactures to France , though the French silks which came in return hurt the trade of our silk-weavers . Every system of trade probably injures the interests of some groups : but it is safe to say that to the average British worker free trade at that time spelt cheap food , more employment , and the absence of any serious grievance about taxation . The customs duties which Gladstone made use of were used for revenue purposes only , that is to say , they were not protective of British producers by keeping foreign goods out but were used only to raise revenue . In levying duties for revenue he concentrated on a few great articles in general consumption . Hence the duties on tea , sugar , beer , spirits and tobacco . He avoided taxing raw materials and foodstuffs ? hence he abolished the tax on timber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved towards the abolition of the sugar duties , for sugar , besides being a food , was also a raw material in the making of jam , sweets and confectionery . He aimed in all respects to free industry , and to help the wage earner by reducing the prices he had to pay and by giving him employment . These principles were the principles of free trade . Free trade had come . The basic fact was that , before Huskisson , Peel and Gladstone , the country had suffered under an incredibly complicated and muddled system of taxes , both customs duties and internal excise duties , which had for the most part originated in an earlier age and under different conditions . A great army of collectors had been required and , so complicated were the laws , even the officials had difficulty in understanding and applying them . Now , after the Industrial Revolution , British industry and commerce no longer needed protection . Britain was ahead of  | other nations , and our trade was expanding . What paid us best was not protection and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world ? the export of more and more British goods , which could only be achieved if we were prepared to take foreign imports in return for our exports . Many free traders believed also that free trade would make for international peace . Free exchange of goods would bring prosperity not only to this country but to other countries as well . And in exchanging their goods countries would become dependent upon one another . It would be foolish to make war on one 's customers , and war would dislocate the intricate machinery of transport , exchange , and banking . Hence it was thought that the more international trade developed , the more secure would be the peace of the world . This belief contributed to the feeling of security and comfort in Victorian England . '  | THE COMING OF TRADE UNIONS AND CO-OPERATIVE SOCIETIES THE prosperity which came to Victorian Britain with the building of the railways and the establishment of free trade was shared by the workers in the form of higher wages , shorter hours , and more regular employment ? but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfair . Their share in this prosperity would have been even smaller than it was if the workers had not made tremendous efforts to form special organizations to protect their interests , both against employers , who naturally wished to keep down the wages they had to pay , and also against unscrupulous shopkeepers , who often overcharged and swindled the poorer classes . Trade unions came into existence early in the eighteenth century , particularly in the woollen industry , to keep up the level of wages , either by striking for more money or by trying to exclude any worker who had not served a full seven-year apprenticeship : for the smaller the supply of workers in a trade , the easier it was for them to get their way about wages and other conditions . In some trades unions were forbidden by special statutes , and they could also be proceeded against at common law , for " conspiracy in restraint of trade " . But it was not until the great French wars that their activities , in the eyes of the law , came abruptly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Combination Acts , which banned trade unions as a revolutionary danger to the safety of the realm . We say " in the eyes of the law " , for some unions continued an underground existence throughout the period when they were illegal . Either they held their meetings in secret or , like the Greenock Coopers ' Society in June 1811 , went on issuing their regular membership cards and , if questioned ,   could doubtless pretend that they were merely a club or friendly society . They might admit they were all interested in making the barrels for the salted herrings but not that they ever combined to help each other over wage rates . Repeal of the Combination Laws ; the G.N.C. T. U. The hero of the first period of trade unionism was Francis Place , a tailor , who had worked his way through hard times , from an apprentice to a master . He owned a very successful shop in Charing Cross , and his parlour there became a meeting-place for reformers . In this and other ways he gave publicity to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Combination Acts . His friend , Joseph Hume , a Radical M.P. , with Huskisson 's help secured the appointment of a parliamentary committee . As a result of its enquiries , in 1824 all laws against trade unions were repealed . The immediate result , as might have been expected , was an outburst of strikes , culminating in one by the shipwrights which   reduced the entire port of London to idleness . Employers were angry and alarmed , and another committee was appointed amid great excitement . But petitions from Manchester , Sheffield and other industrial towns poured in to Members of Parliament , and workmen even made their way to the House of Commons , demanding that their case should be heard . This determination on the part of the workers defeated attempts to reimpose the Combination Acts , but severe limits were set to the powers of the unions . They must confine their activities strictly to " consulting upon and determining the rate of wages and prices " ; special penalties were fixed for any " molestation " or " obstruction " . Another man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Robert Owen , whose experience in improving the conditions of labour in his own cotton-mills at New Lanark led him to try to extend his ideas of industrial organization over the rest of the country through the now legalized trade unions . He realized that the isolated strikes of small local unions would not avail . There must be co-ordinated , national action . He founded a Builders ' Union , which he hoped would be strong enough to take over the whole of the building work in the country and run it without any employers . This was followed in 1834 by a Grand National Consolidated Trades Union , which was joined by half a million people . There were at this time far-reaching , though often vague , plans in the minds of the union leaders . One plan was for a general strike or " national holiday " ( the Chartists later spoke of a " Sacred Month " ) . This would be a means of breaking the capitalists ' hold over industry , and giving the workers power . There were two ideas of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a peaceful change-over from capitalism to socialism . " The men may remain at leisure , " it was said , " no law can compel them to work against their will . They may walk the streets with the arms folded . . . . What happens in consequence ? ... Government falls into confusion , and every link in the chain which binds society together is broken in a moment by the inert conspiracy of the poor against the rich . " Thus , some of the workers thought , might come the social revolution which would give them power and redress their ills . The leaders of the G.N.C.T.U. seem   also to have pictured as the final development a scheme of workers ' control over the whole industrial system ? a kind of syndicalist organization of society , with local lodges as the base of a pyramid which might have at its apex a kind of trades parliament . Such ideas were to appear again ? much later . In the meantime nothing came of them , but the movement for the G.N.C.T.U. gave rise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Tolpuddle Martyrs While workers in mines and the textile and other industries were forming unions , farm labourers had been doing the same . In 1830 starvation conditions existed in many rural districts of southern England , and there were demands for higher wages . Bands of farm labourers marched from village to village , appealing sometimes to the squire , sometimes to the local magistrates , sometimes to the farmers themselves . We have already mentioned the severe repression which followed this episode , sometimes known as the Last Labourers ' Revolt . Another of its consequences was a brief flare-up of trade union activity in the countryside . Owen 's Grand National Union formed a special sub-division , the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers , and wages tended to rise . When the labourers in the Dorset village of Tolpuddle were threatened with a reduction , they wrote to the Grand National Union for advice . As a result two brothers , named Loveless , and four other men formed a branch of the Friendly Society of Agricultural Labourers , and many labourers joined it ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer be tried for " combining " to obtain higher wages , it was known that members joining the Union went through a quaint ritual with masks and other curious things ; so it was decided to charge them under another of Pitt 's repression laws made during the French wars ? the Unlawful Oaths Act of 1797 . The Loveless brothers and four other men were arrested , tried at Dorchester in 1834 , and sentenced to seven years ' transportation . It was a savage sentence to pass upon men of good character who had done no violence , and George Loveless was a Wesleyan local preacher .   This fierce vengeance on the Tolpuddle Martyrs , as the men were sympathetically called , aroused great indignation . Nevertheless they were shipped off to Tasmania to work in chains ; it took four years to get the remainder of the sentence remitted , and it was another two years before they returned to England . As for Owen 's Grand National Union , it was wrecked by internal strife , and fell to pieces about the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unions in the ' Forties and ' Fifties The Tolpuddle trial alarmed other Unions . For fifteen years or so we hear less of their activities . The energies of the workers were devoted instead to the agitation for the People 's Charter , a sixpoint political programme drafted by Francis Place , of which the main object was to demand the parliamentary vote for every man . If this movement had had any success , then no doubt Parliament would have been used to help the trade unions . But up to the time of the final failure of the Chartists in 1848 , the chief benefit the trade unions brought to their members was through their eventually successful organization of support for the Ten Hours movement , which . had been begun in the factory districts as early as 1831 . The bitterness of the hostility shown towards any interference with the power and authority of the employer , such as a trade union must necessarily seek to practise , may be judged from The Economist 's description of the Ten Hours Bill of 1847 as " The Lords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the century , however , there was a revival of trade unionism , based on new aims and a better organization for the new Unions of better-paid workers . There was more thought of conciliation and of the closely related material interests of employer and workers . In many cases the strike was no longer regarded as the best weapon . In addition to such practical advantages as insurance of tools , the Unions offered Friendly Society benefits of payment in times of sickness or unemployment , and assistance to the family on the death of a member . They also helped members to emigrate , to reduce competition for jobs , though this device was exploited by rogues who made the round voyage . But the important fact is that , when men paid a high   weekly subscription in expectation of substantial benefits , they were not so willing to risk the Unions ' funds in long disputes with employers . They settled disputes by arbitration rather than by strikes . In 1851 , a number of Unions connected with the engineering trade united to form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid secretary , and headquarters in London , and its organization was established on such sound principles as to become a " New Model " for others to imitate . In course of time the Carpenters and Joiners and other trade unions , each composed of skilled artisans who were able to pay a fair-sized regular subscription , followed the same policy . Such unions were respected by employers because they had money in the bank and prudence as their first principle . Growing Power of the Unions But some of the smaller unions were less respectable : in 1866 at Sheffield , for instance , they put gunpowder in the grinding-trough of a cutlery worker if he did not conform with their requirements , or dropped a keg of gunpowder down his chimney . Sometimes injury or death resulted . Many employers became alarmed at the growth of trade unionism , and some of them hoped that the Combination Acts would again be brought into force . In 1868 the Unions began to meet together in an annual Trades Union Congress ( T.U.C. ) to discuss matters of general welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working-class householders in towns , who included many trade unionists , decided that it would be wiser to give the unions more power rather than less , and this was done by the Trade Union Act of 1871 . This measure for the first time provided full legal protection for their funds , and gave them the status of Friendly Societies . The Unions , however , were not satisfied with the Liberal Government which passed the Act , for it did not allow picketing during a strike . They therefore looked in 1874 to the new Conservative Government . Disraeli , who was anxious to win their support , gave the Unions what they wanted . His Act of 1875 legalized peaceful picketing during strikes and also made it impossible to prosecute strikers under the common law of conspiracy .   At the 1874 election two working men had taken their seats in the House of Commons ; they were the first working-class M.P.s . They were both miners : Thomas Burt , M.P . for Morpeth ; and Alexander Macdonald , who was returned for Stafford . A dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been a trade-union leader , became an under-secretary in Gladstone 's third Ministry . A wave of trade unionism that swept the country in the early 1870 's aroused farm workers to form the Agricultural Labourers ' Union , led by Joseph Arch , a Warwickshire farm-hand and lay preacher . But in the later ' 70 's , when agriculture suffered an acute depression owing to the importation of American wheat and there was widespread unemployment on the land , membership of this Union decreased . By 1894 it had ceased to exist , and the present National Union of Farm Workers was not formed until after the First World War . Trade Unionism also experienced great difficulty among railway workers , for the employing companies said that , to be safe and efficient , a railway ought to have the same sort of  | discipline as an army . The Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants was formed in 1872 , but it was too weak to organize a strike . In 1890 , however , the first serious stoppage resulted in some Government help over dangerously long hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the L.N.E.R. , refused to recognize the unions . The members of the earlier trade unions were in the main skilled workers . The first of the great Unions of unskilled workers was that of the London Dockers , dating from 1886 . At first few believed that such a tough body of men as the dockers could be controlled by a Union , but in 1889 under the leadership of John Burns they won a strike in London for the " Dockers ' Tanner " ( 6d. an hour ) and a minimum of four hours ' employment . The gas workers were another unskilled and underpaid body of workers who achieved the same kind of success at this time . By 1920 ( to look ahead ) a score of these struggling groups had been united into a single Transport and General Workers ' Union , which the late Ernest Bevin ( a farm boy who rose to be Foreign Secretary ) built up into the most powerful organization of its kind in the world . The Co-operative Shops Robert Owen was the pioneer of co-operation as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the benefit of his employees at New Lanark , and later on gave much of his energies to schemes for co-operative production , that is , forming groups of craftsmen who would join together to sell the things they made , thus getting rid of the capitalist employer . Too many slackers flocked to the co-operative workshops , as they were called , for them to achieve any lasting success , but it was as a result of Owen 's teaching that in 1844 , during a trade depression , twenty-eight flannel weavers joined together to establish the first modern consumers ' co-operative . The modest-looking shop which they opened in Toad Lane ? Lancashire for " the old lane " ? Rochdale , was the home of one of the weavers , used to keep the stock which they bought with their original capital of ? 1 a head . The system was as simple as the place where it was first practised .   They bought at wholesale prices and sold at retail prices . The profit , after allowing for the cost of running the shop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the purchases each of them had made . This profit was the Co-operative Dividend . Membership grew ; the capital also grew , for each new member had to pay for a small share ( on which he would get interest ) ; and there was no limit to the number of similar societies which could be started anywhere . The idea spread fast ? in Lancashire and Yorkshire , then into Scotland and the Midlands , last of all to London and the southern counties , where conservative prejudices were strongest . In 1863 the first Co-operative Wholesale Society started business , in Manchester : this meant that the retail shops were now large and numerous enough to join together to form their own organization to make wholesale purchases on their behalf . This enabled them to buy more cheaply , as large concerns can usually do ; and although the C.W.S. made a slow start ? after twenty years   their annual profits were only about ? 20,000-they grew to have their own factories , bakeries , etc. , and nowadays are among the largest trading organizations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the people , comparable to the steady pressure of the trade unions for higher wages , shorter hours , and better working conditions ? The answer is threefold . First and foremost , the " Co-op " helped people to a higher standard of living by giving good value for money , since the dividend was really a reduction in prices . It also played a part in the struggle against adulteration of food , and helped the trade unions to get rid of the last " truck " shops . The second main virtue , however , was that the movement encouraged thrift , because it was always made easy to leave the dividend to accumulate at a good rate of interest . Third , the " Co-op " was a real contribution towards the growth of democracy . Each store was managed by a committee elected by members and composed of members , working under the eyes of critics who had a direct interest in checking each mistake or extravagance . This makes it all the more creditable that the stores have also kept up the tradition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of devoting some part of their profits to educational and cultural objects . This mixture of hard-headed business with a genuine desire for self-improvement was one of the strongest features of the great Victorian age . ' Compare Tennyson 's description of a Mechanics ' Institute outing   THE WORKSHOP OF THE WORLD THIS proud title was in a sense held by Britain throughout the nineteenth century , but its third quarter is the time when our industries had become big enough to supply all demands . It was likewise the epoch when the rest of the world had reached the stage of making big demands for the goods we could supply but had not yet gone on to the next stage , of supplying the goods for themselves . At the 1851 census our population was shown to be one-half urban , one-half rural ? perhaps the ideal mixture , but in any case one which indicates the great growth in our manufacturing towns since 1815 . About the same time the nations of Europe and the United States of America , which might have begun to overtake our industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the struggle for national unity in Germany and Italy , the rise and fall of the Second Empire in France , in America the slavery dispute and the war between the States ? which in varying degrees distracted their attention in the next two decades from the peaceful development of manufactures . British businessmen saw their chance and took it . Between 1850 and 1872 the value of our exports rose from ? 71 million to ? 256 million . In the same period the total quantities of coal , pig-iron , and cotton cloth ? three staple commodities in which we already dealt largely ? produced in Britain were approximately doubled . The tonnage of shipping cleared from British ports multiplied itself two and a half times in just over twenty years ( 1854-75 ) , and in 1870 the volume of our external trade ( i.e. goods coming into , and going out of , the country ) was more than that of France , Germany and Italy put together and was between three and four times that of the United States of America . Gold discoveries in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising prices , and in such periods profit-making is comparatively easy ;   what is more remarkable , wage-levels rose sufficiently for their purchasing power to go up a little , year by year . It was a period of tremendous optimism , in which Dr. Samuel Smiles , the author of Self-Help ( 1859 ) , Thrift , The Lives of the Engineers , etc. , used the careers of the earlier industrial pioneers to point an attractive road to fortune to English and Scottish youth . Science and Self-Help This worship of self-help perhaps does a little to explain one most extraordinary deficiency in the equipment of the Workshop of the World , namely the poor provision made for scientific and technical education . Several foreign countries outstripped us in this respect , although we were the wealthiest country and owed our wealth largely to scientific progress . An adequate training in science could only be obtained in a rather haphazard way , by private study and experiment , or by apprenticeship to industry or to some private researcher . Improved provision for medical training had been made early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last decades that organized courses of study in chemistry , physics , engineering , and so on , began to be established in universities and technical colleges and , in the case of chemistry and physics , in schools . Thus the great Victorian scientists , the men who laid the foundations of modern science and opened the way to so many practical applications of the principles they discovered , usually " picked up " their knowledge and training by following various paths very different from the broad highway now offered in the science courses of grammar schools , universities and technical colleges . The scientists of those days , like the businessmen , were self-made men . Sir Humphry Davy , for example , who was responsible for " discovering " Faraday , the central figure in the scientific advances of this period , had himself begun life as apprentice to a surgeon and apothecary . He studied chemistry on his own , and then assisted Dr. Beddoes , who had set up at Clifton , Bristol , a Pneumatic Institution for treating disease by breathing . Davy , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was appointed a lecturer at the Royal Institution , which had been set up privately   for scientific research and lectures and granted a royal charter in 1800 . Gaining knowledge and training in these ways , Davy went on to his own great researches in chemistry , which make him one of the pioneers of that subject . And , as we know , he invented the safety-lamp for miners . Michael Faraday ( 1791-1867 ) , another self-educated scientist , was a blacksmith 's son . At twelve Faraday was an errand boy , and then he was apprenticed to a bookbinder and stationer . He read much and went to lectures . He went to hear Davy at the Royal Institution . Afterwards he bound a set of notes and sent them to the great man . Davy was so impressed that he took on Faraday as his assistant and thereby opened a scientific career to him . Faraday indeed went on to a lifetime of research . He made basic advances in chemistry , but is to-day best remembered for his work as a pioneer in physics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the whole development of electrical engineering , on which twentieth-century life is so dependent , can be traced back to Faraday 's discovery of electro-magnetic induction in 1831 . Lord Kelvin ( 1824-1907 ) , another great pioneer worker in the field of electricity and physics , had what seems to-day a rather more conventional scientific education . For his father happened to be a mathematics professor at Glasgow University , and Scotland was in many matters of education ahead of England . As a Glasgow student the young William Thomson , as he then was , was able to get a little laboratory training from the professor of astronomy . He proceeded to Cambridge , distinguished himself as a mathematician there , and almost at once became professor of natural philosophy ( science ) at Glasgow , where he was the dominant scientific figure for over fifty years . Besides his achievements in pure science , Lord Kelvin was concerned with the laying of the Atlantic cables and the improvement of the mariner 's compass . He also set up the first physics laboratory for students in Great Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' eighties , our most important inventors had no proper scientific training .

It helped also in the final triumph of the steamship , for steel plates were thinner than iron though equally strong , so the steel-built ship was lighter and rose higher out of the water . This enabled it to stow more cargo before being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important because the great drawback to the steamship had been the difficulty of carrying cargo and coal in sufficient quantity . The Age of Steamships This problem was already being tackled from the other end by making the propulsion of the steamship more efficient and thus economizing in fuel . The screw had replaced the paddle-wheels of the earliest steamboats , and in 1854 John Elder of Glasgow invented the compound engine ; this was followed by the triple and quadruple expansion engines , which reduced fuel consumption by 50 per cent in ten years . Even so , such beautifully designed sailing-craft as the tea clippers of the China trade , built latterly of wood on an iron frame , might still have held their own in some cases against the iron steamer ; but the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 , the year when the Cutty Sark was launched , provided a handicap on the route to the East which no sailing-ship could surmount . Thus all through the second half of the nineteenth century the British iron and steel industry was building the most up-to-date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for many of our competitors . The shipbuilding industry flourished at Glasgow ? where the Clyde , once fordable at low tide , had to be dredged to nineteen feet to serve the shipyards stretching along its banks for twenty miles . It was also well established on Tyneside and elsewhere on the north-east coast of England and on the west at Birkenhead ; and was even carried across the Irish Sea to Belfast , where Harland and Wolff ( a German immigrant ) developed after 1860 shipyards which grew to be the largest in the world . It was not until about 1900 that ships were equipped with the steam turbine engine , which had been invented by Sir Charles Parsons  | in 1884 , with the different purpose of generating electricity . But long before this Britain was deriving full benefit from all the changes . We built the ships ; being faster and more efficient than before , they carried more goods at lower cost ; every voyage in British service meant a profitable exchange of our cotton and other manufactures and coal for foreign raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by us from selling the ships to foreigners or from hiring them out in the carrying trade of foreign countries . The construction of shipbuilding yards and of merchant ships was accompanied by the building or extension of docks . The work of the earlier part of the century was continued . New docks were added to the London system , including Tilbury ( 1882 ? 6 ) some twenty miles down the river . Liverpool docks were extended and Manchester built its Ship Canal , opened by Queen Victoria in 1894 , to the Mersey . Southampton , with its magnificent estuaries , revived after 1850 ; it became the headquarters of the P. and O. Line to the East , though the famous Ocean Dock which can take several of the world 's largest liners at the same time was not constructed until 1912 . During the second half of the nineteenth century , some ports , thanks to railway communication , sprang up almost out of nothing , like Barrow-in-Furness and Grimsby . Cardiff , which had fewer than 2,000 inhabitants at the first census , and built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to pass Newcastle as the world 's greatest coal exporter . Bristol , the second port in the kingdom in the Middle Ages , likewise enjoyed a great revival of trade and prosperity after 1884 , when the corporation bought up the recently built docks at Avonmouth . These accommodate the larger vessels , which can not be brought up the river into the heart of the ancient city . As steamships gradually took the place of sailing-ships , steamships did on the ocean what railways did on the land . Just as the railways linked one part of a country or continent with another , so steamships linked up distant parts of the world and all its different continents by regular ocean lines , until it was no more expensive to bring many tons of corn from Canada than it had been to bring a few hundred quarters from Norfolk to London in the seventeenth century . There was also the effect on trade of the  | opening of the Suez Canal , already mentioned . This was the work of the French engineer , Ferdinand de Lesseps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it provided a shorter route for ships bound for the East ? India , China , Australia , New Zealand ? and saved them making the long voyage round the Cape of Good Hope . The East India Company had for many years tried to trade with China , though the Chinese disliked foreign " barbarians " ( as they called foreigners ) on the soil of the Celestial Empire . But after our Chinese War of 1840-2 , China was opened to British and other European trade , and our exports to China increased from ? 936,000 in 1850 to ? 6,138,000 in 1870 . Trade was also opened up with Japan , the Malay Peninsula , and even Siam . Opening-up of New Lands During the nineteenth century , great developments were taking place in lands overseas . The great prairies of mid-western America were being settled , and as the American trunk railways were extended from the Atlantic coast , corn could be sent to Britain to supplement and replace home supplies for our growing urban population . British trade with Canada and the United States increased yearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufactured goods . In South America , Britain found a new customer , the Argentine , which after long years of strife , settled down to corn-growing and cattle-rearing . In 1889 the first shipload of cattle from the Argentine was landed in England , and already our merchants were sending British goods there , establishing offices in Buenos Aires , and investing capital in railways and factories . By the beginning of the twentieth century the Argentine chilled-beef industry began to rival the Australian trade . In the southern hemisphere , Australia developed sheep-farming until it became the chief source of our raw wool , and by 1914 Australia normally had about 90 million sheep ? one-sixth of all the sheep in the world ? and an annual export approaching 800 million lb. of wool . Australia also became a wheat-growing country , with its harvest reaped during our winter , and so the grain reached Britain when the stocks from northern harvests were becoming exhausted . It was in the Australian grain trade that the long-distance ocean  | sailing-ships rendered their last service , steering adventurously east-about round Cape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a means was discovered of sending meat to England by refrigerator ships . With the rapid growth of new towns , Britain offered a big market for all qualities of meat . In America surplus beef was cooked and packed in tins for export . In Australia also a tinning industry was set up , and as early as the Great Exhibition of 1851 there was an exhibition of tinned mutton , though this does not seem to have become popular . A freezing machine was invented to assist in keeping the meat in good condition on the long voyage from the southern hemisphere to Britain . At last , in 1880 , the first satisfactory cargo of frozen meat ? beef , mutton and lamb ? reached England from Australia , and in 1883 from New Zealand . Later improvements in chilling and freezing made it possible for them to send butter to Britain , and specially constructed fruit ships brought us the harvest of South African orchards and West Indian plantations . Thus an important advance had been made in our trade with the Empire overseas . Zenith and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from abroad , while it greatly benefited the workers in the " workshop of the world " , had the opposite effect on our farmers and farm labourers . To understand this we must go back a little . The repeal of the corn laws in 1846 did not ruin agriculture as many people foretold . Indeed , the decade 1853 ? 62 proved to be the golden age of English agriculture , and " high farming " with plentiful capital expenditure continued to show good profits up to the ' seventies . The foundation of the Royal Agricultural Society in 1838 and of the Rothamsted Experimental Station in 1842 had prepared the way for an era of scientific progress . Better methods of land drainage were now introduced . It was at a Royal Society Show in 1843 that a drainage engineer , Josiah Parkes , first saw some little clay pipes made by a gardener for heating his master 's forcing frames . Parkes at once realized that such pipes could be used instead of ditches for draining fields .  | " My lord , " he said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of England . " In order to encourage farmers to spend money on scientific drainage , Sir Robert Peel introduced the first Public Drainage Act , by which the government set aside ? 2 million for making loans to farmers for that purpose . The study of agricultural chemistry became more than guesswork , and fertilizers , such as guano , bone meal , and phosphates , were applied to the soil with good results . Swedes , mangel-wurzels , and other novel root crops were grown . Russian linseed and North American meals were imported for feeding cattle , and the improvement in the breeding of stock continued . Again , the railways played an important part by providing wider markets for the staple farm products , corn and cattle , while also making it easier and cheaper for the farmer to acquire such things as machinery , fertilizers and high-quality seed corn . These changes enabled high profits to be combined with economy in the use of labour . For agriculture , which had employed nearly 2,000,000 in 1851 ? it was then much the largest industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1871 . Yet at the latter date the cultivated area had reached record size ? nearly twice as much land under wheat , and more than twice as much bearing root crops , as at the present day . But the position of the farm labourers of the ' fifties and ' sixties , who were not driven from the country though they might be attracted by the higher wage rates of the towns or better prospects overseas , was fortunate indeed in comparison with the lot of their fellows ? and of the farmers who employed them ? when the prosperity of the country-side came suddenly to an end . Between 1875 and 1884 cold springs and wet summers resulted in poor harvests ; the harvest of 1879 is said to have been the worst in the century . About the same time , the home market was suddenly flooded with the cheap corn from the great new cornfields of America , which were large enough to derive full benefit from machinery such as the McCormick combine harvester , then practically unknown in Britain . Their new railways enabled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought it to Britain where it could be sold at a lower price than our own ? and there were now no Corn Laws to protect the British  | farmer . The price of corn dropped . In 1876 , wheat had fetched 44s. a quarter , in 1877 it rose to 50s. , but by 1885 it had dropped to 32s . A second wave of agricultural depression followed in 1891 ? 9 : in 1894 the average price of wheat fell below 23s. , a figure to which the records of three hundred years afford no parallel . Many British farmers were faced with ruin , and there was great distress among labourers . Farmers now turned much of their land into pasture for rearing cattle , which was fairly well worth while in spite of imported frozen meat . Stock farmers , if able to invest money in their farms , found the breeding of pedigree herds very profitable . The increasing population in towns demanded more milk , butter and eggs , so dairy farming became prosperous . Fruit-growing and marketgardening and , in some districts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But all this amounted to very little in comparison with the good profits and plentiful , if ill-paid , employment ? a man to every twenty acres , or thereabouts ? which the great corn-farming districts had formerly provided . Many of the younger men had to leave the countryside and look for work in the towns , which was not easy to find because during the 1880 's there was a trade depression in the towns as well . Britain had over-produced during the good years , and both America and Germany were beginning to compete seriously with our manufactures in the world markets . The export trades recovered again , but at the end of the century ( and right up to 1914 ) our agriculture struggled on without much success , being undersold all the time by cheap imports from distant continents . However , the steamers which , as we have seen , made it possible for free trade in corn to bring about the ruin of British farmers , also provided a means of relief : for this was one of the great ages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hundred years after Waterloo . They left from town and country alike , inspired to move in good times by the hope of bettering themselves and making a good use of their savings , and in bad times by the belief that any change must be beneficial to them . But of all the emigrants those who were the best adapted to settle overseas were probably the dispossessed farmers and farm labourers and their stout-hearted wives , who went to till the  | wheat-lands of the American Middle West and the prairie provinces of Canada . The uprooting of thousands of families was nevertheless in any case a very painful business : From the lone shieling of the misty island Mountains divide us , and the waste of seas Yet still the blood is strong , the heart is Highland , And we in dreams behold the Hebrides ! The Scots were perhaps readier to express their emotions than the exiled English , but all who went left much behind , though they gained much in the new homes they created . This was the cost of empire-building . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country that industrialization and emigration went on side by side ? we had the people to man the ever-increasing machines  | of our towns and also the people to found new Britains overseas . It was no idle boast but a fair summary of Queen Victoria 's great reign , when her successor inscribed his coinage with a new royal style ? Britanniarum Omnium Rex , King of All the Britains . But we have no space within the limits of this little book to tell the proud story of the growth of Canada , Australia , New Zealand and British South Africa . Instead we must now turn aside from the social and economic development of the British people within these islands , which is our main theme , to look in a different direction ? to see how the shape and activities of government were changing to meet the needs of the industrial age . '  | NEW TRENDS IN GOVERNMENT THE reign of Queen Victoria ( 1837 ? 1901 ) had begun soon after a series of reforms , passed by Parliament in the years 1832 ? 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's subjects . These included the Factory Act of 1833 , already described ; a new poor law , designed chiefly to do away with the wasteful Speenhamland system ; and a law which started the modern Town Councils . But the first and most important of all was the Parliamentary Reform Act , passed in June 1832 , for this brought to Parliament the sort of M.P . ' s who were interested in passing other reforms ; it also enabled people to argue that , since Parliament itself had been reformed once , it could be reformed again ? until after a hundred years of change we arrived at the present democratic rules for choosing members . The great Reform Act , as it is often called , did two things , both of which are connected with the industrial changes which had been taking place . A number of small towns and villages which had returned Members to Parliament in earlier centuries lost their special representatives , and most of these seats , totalling 143 , were redistributed to the big towns , like Manchester , Birmingham , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revolution . Others were allocated to the most populous counties , as an addition to the two M.P . ' s which each county had returned since the Middle Ages , or to the newer outlying districts of London . In the second place , the Act recognized the fact that the middle class ? small capitalists , tradesmen , shopkeepers , minor professional men , even clerks ? had been made more important by the growth of industry . In towns the old and complicated system of voting , which often enabled one or two rich men to control the entire result , was swept away and the right to vote was given to every householder ( male and over twenty-one ) who owned or rented premises worth ? 10 a year .  | An Era of Middle-Class Rule For a generation , accordingly , the middle class , in so far as its members chose to study political questions and used their right to vote , decided the result of every General Election . But by 1867 the skilled artisan or other working man in regular employment had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of affairs that Parliament , with much less fuss than in 1832 , extended the vote to all householders in towns , however small the value of the property , and to occupants of lodgings worth ? 10 a year unfurnished . In 1884 this system was applied also to the county seats , so that farm labourers and coal-miners ( who often lived in villages straggling over the coal-field ) might have the vote . In 1872 the Ballot Act had established secret voting , and in 1885 the Redistribution Act made single-member constituencies almost universal , so that each vote cast might be equally independent and equally important . The franchise laws of 1867 , 1884 , and 1885 were not further altered until the end of the first world war ; 1 it is often said that they established democracy in Britain . They certainly were important steps in that direction , but there was still a considerable way to go . Women were left out altogether . Of the men , the proportion who still had no right to vote , either because they were not householders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain in one place for a minimum period of twelve months , or because they received poor relief , was at least one in every three . Moreover , as M.P . ' s were not ( until 1911 ) paid for their services , candidates for Parliament came from the families of the aristocracy and landed gentry , or ? to an increasing extent as time went on ? from the middle classes : a working-class representative , for whom a trade union or other organization would have to find money was still a rarity in Parliament right up to the death of Queen Victoria . Of course , there were many M.P . ' s who sympathized with the workers and helped to pass reforms for their benefit , but it was not the same as if they had been free to elect men who understood their needs from their own experience .  | Chartism and the New Poor Law The history of the Chartist movement ( 1838-48 ) is really an illustration of this . It is usual to point out that , when payment of M.P . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political points of the Charter had been in principle conceded , except the not very sensible proposal for general elections to be held annually . But William Lovett and Feargus O'Connor , the two principal leaders ? both of whom were sent to prison during the period of agitation ? and the bulk of their followers wanted something more than manhood suffrage , vote by ballot , and other changes in electoral procedure . They aimed at getting a different kind of M.P. , the sort of Member who had first-hand experience of the sufferings of the poor . The result would be the enactment of a policy of social reform . So far from being completed in 1911 , the Chartist demands in this sense only began to be considered about 1906 , the year in which ( as we shall see in due course ) Members of Parliament of a new social type first appeared in significant numbers . The social reforms which the Chartists advocated were often vaguely described as impracticable or inconsistent with each other . But they were certainly united in their outcry against the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Wesleyan minister turned Chartist agitator , called it " this damnable law , which violates all the laws of God " . Yet the law which bore most hardly upon the lives of the workers was left unaltered throughout the Queen 's reign . The new poor law of 1834 stopped the Speenhamland system of rates in aid of wages by trying to abolish outdoor relief . If the poor needed help , let them come to the workhouse for it . If they came to the workhouse , let them find that the help they got ? food and shelter for themselves and their families ? was administered in such a strict , mean , and humiliating fashion that people would rather die than become paupers . If they would not become paupers , then they must either find a job , however hard and poorly paid , or emigrate , or die . In spite of Dickens 's Oliver Twist and in spite of the Chartist agitation , the grim new workhouses remained the typical public buildings of Victorian England . Outdoor relief was never wholly abolished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after about 1870 the principle of abolition survived chiefly in rural areas . Some relieving officers and workhouse masters administered the law in a kindlier spirit than others , and the workhouse infirmary , where the sick lay , gradually took on more the character of a hospital than a place of punishment . But the fear of the workhouse remained one of the biggest factors in creating and maintaining the habits of hard work , thrift , and adaptability ? whole families would move about the country , on  | foot if necessary , in search of employment ? which made what the books call our " Labour Force " ( i.e. the workers ) so efficient an instrument for creating wealth . The supervision of the Poor Law , at first entrusted to commissioners , was the main task of a new government department set up in 1871 . This was the Local Government Board , having as its other work the control of the town councils , which had been reformed and put on an entirely new basis in 1835 . Local government was a second point at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially in the new industrial towns , for the law intervened to restrict within narrow limits the improvements which a council could provide for the town it served . Local Government As with the central government , so also with local government there was a need for reform . The corporate towns were in a deplorable state , and the reforming Parliament in 1833 set itself to this task also . First a commission of inquiry was appointed , and in its report it revealed how corrupt were the conditions prevailing . The town government or corporation was , in many cases , elected by only a handful of residents , those who claimed an ancient right to be " freemen " , and the majority of residents were excluded thereby from any share in control . When elected , the corporations were often neglectful of their duties . Funds , which had been placed in their hands for charitable purposes , were not properly used , or were even used for private purposes . Charities for schools , when in the hands of the corporation , were often abused ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one or two pupils . To put an end to these abuses , the Municipal Corporations Act was passed in 1835 and it applied to about two hundred corporate towns . In all cases , the town council was to be elected by all the male ratepayers . The councillors in turn were to elect their mayor , who held office for one year , and a number of aldermen , who are additional members of the council , for six years ( the councillors themselves serve for three years at a time ) . At regular intervals there was to be an audit of the town 's accounts . This im- portant Act , which marks the beginning of democratic government in local affairs , should be remembered along with the great Reform Act of 1832 in the history of Parliament . Further important local government legislation was passed late in Queen Victoria 's reign . The Local Government Act of 1888 created new local government authorities ? the county councils , whose members were to be elected by popular vote ? and these took the place of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s . London was made a separate county . The larger boroughs , with a population of over 50,000 , were given a position of equal importance with the counties ; they were made County Boroughs . These new authorities , the County and County Borough Councils , became the most important local government authorities . They were given by Parliament powers to look after bridges and roads , public health and housing , and by subsequent Acts ( e.g. the Education Act of 1902 and the Local Government Act of 1929 ) powers over other matters , including education and the maintenance of the poor . In 1894 another Act was passed setting up a number of lesser elective authorities ? Urban District Councils , Rural District Councils , Parish Councils , and , for the smallest parishes , a Parish Meeting . These various local government laws prescribed in detail how the ratepayers were to elect councillors , how aldermen , mayors , chairmen , etc. , were to be appointed , and what salaried officials ( town clerk , borough treasurer , etc. ) were to be provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? preservation of good order , street lighting and cleansing , and so forth ? to which other laws from time to time made additions . But in Britain , unlike many other countries in Europe , a local council , however enthusiastically it may be supported by local opinion , had ( and has ) no power to engage in any activity , however praiseworthy , which the law has not declared to be a proper activity for local councils . It was the business of the Local Government Board to watch for , and check , any attempt to expand . When Birmingham , for example , wanted to collect the savings of its citizens and have its own municipal bank , it required a special Act of Parliament , secured by the influence of Joseph Chamber- Board . In 1889 a Board of Agriculture was set up to deal with the pressing problems of the great depression ; in 1885 a separate Scottish Office for the affairs of the Northern Kingdom . The Board of Education , created out of a committee of the Privy Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such minor departments as the Office of Works ( controlling Crown property ) and the Post Office the unenviable position that the Minister in charge of the Department was not necessarily a member of the Cabinet . The Post Office The multifarious activities at the post-office counter of to-daypensions alongside parcels , licences jostling letters , and a special queue for the Savings Bank ? are a natural development from the fact that in Victorian times the Post Office was the only centrally administered government service with which people in every class of society had any regular dealings . When Queen Victoria came to the throne in 1837 the public post had already been in existence for two hundred years , but was about to be transformed as regards both speed and scope and cost . Until the end of the eighteenth century , mails were carried by post-boys on horseback . Then a certain John Palmer , who had charge of the mails at Bath , suggested to the Prime Minister , William Pitt , a scheme for running fast mail coaches which could carry letters cheaply because the passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaches started from Bristol for London on 2nd August , 1784 , and services soon multiplied throughout the country . Each coach was accompanied by an armed guard in case of attack by highwaymen . At the end of the eighteenth century , most large towns had a daily delivery of letters , and small ones two or three a week . By 1829 , the date of the opening of the General Post Office at St. Martin's-le-Grand , on the north side of St. Paul 's Cathedral , the mail coaches had long been the standard means of fast travel between London and the provinces . But the railways , even in their earliest days , transformed the speed at which letters were conveyed . The first travelling post office began to ply between Birmingham and Liverpool in 1838 , and soon the wayside stations  | on all main lines were being serviced by special sorting wagons and contrivances for picking up and setting down mailbags at speed . The early steamships , too , though lacking space for bulkier cargo , were well suited to speeding-up the overseas mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying American and other mails , Samuel Cunard , a Canadian shipowner , obtained a contract and a subsidy for carrying the mails from Liverpool to Halifax , Nova Scotia , and Boston , Massachusetts . He was a pioneer in the use of steamships for long journeys , and his example was followed by the Peninsular and Oriental Line , which undertook mail services to India , Ceylon and China . By 1874 , when the Universal Postal Union was founded to regulate charges and conditions for postage between countries , it was possible to send a letter almost anywhere in the civilized world at a cheap uniform rate , prepaid by an adhesive stamp . It was the distinctive achievement of the British Post Office that it led the way in bringing the postal service within the reach of the masses . In January , 1840 , a penny post for the whole of Britain was introduced by Rowland Hill ( 1795 ? 1879 ) in place of the old system of charges which varied according to distance and weight and were paid by the recipient ? a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had long advocated postal reforms . He was specially attached to the Treasury in order to carry them out . Postage stamps came into use in May of the same year , being defined by Hill as " a bit of paper just large enough to bear the stamp , and covered at the back with a glutinous wash which , by applying a little moisture , might be attached to the back of the letter " . A few years later , in 1855 , the first street letter-boxes were set up in London to save people going to the Post Office with their stamped letters . The penny post led to a great increase in the number of letters ? the quantity had already multiplied ten times by 1870 . Post cards ( an Austrian invention ) came into use in Britain in 1870 . But it was not until 1883 that the Post Office undertook to carry parcels , though it is evidence of Victorian earnestness that the book post had been instituted in 1848 . One other landmark in postal history was the extension of penny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle ? of enormous  | value to imperial good feeling ? was first brought into limited practice on Christmas Day , 1898 . New Functions ; The Savings Bank Besides organizing the transmission of letters and parcels , the Post Office acquired the telegraph and telephone systems . The first experiments in electric telegraphy were made in 1837 . But it was not till 1868 that the government decided to take over all the private telegraph companies , excepting the systems used by the railways for their own business . The transfer took place in 1870 ; the government paid a total of ? 11 million to the companies , and from that time telegrams had to be sent through the Post Office . Submarine cables enabled the telegraphic system to be extended to other countries . In 1851 , the first successful cable was laid between Dover and Calais , and from that time business men in the Stock Exchanges of London and Paris could keep each other informed as to prices of stocks and shares during the day 's work . In 1866 , the first regular telegraphic service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon a network of cables , the joint property of British and foreign governments , which gave direct and instant communication with most parts of the world . The telephone , which was invented in 1876 , was also taken over by the Post Office for development in 1896 . But it was not until the twentieth century that the habit of telephoning made letter-writing in some circles appear old-fashioned . It is more important for us to refer now to one completely non-postal activity which dates back to 1861 and is very characteristic of the Victorian age about which we are thinking , namely the Post Office Savings Bank . Gladstone , who as Chancellor of the Exchequer was responsible for its foundation , regarded it as one of the greatest achievements of his career . On the opening day there were 435 deposits of an average amount of ? 2 ; these had grown by December 1951 , to 22,450,000 accounts , averaging about ? 85 each ? a remarkable growth , even when we make full allowance for the fall in the value of money . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it stood for ? to encourage the saving of small sums by enabling the depositor of a shilling or two to earn interest on his money  | and to feel that his deposit , being guaranteed by the State , was at least as secure as the investments of the richest man in the land . Gladstone and other chancellors of his period kept taxes low by rigid economy and a stern refusal of social services . National expenditure per head of population remained stationary for thirty years ( 1857-87 ) . The money was left , as Gladstone once said , " to fructify in the pocket of the tax-payer " . A ' system of government which kept things cheap ( including for example the cost of postage ) and did all it could to encourage the habit of thrift was , in his view , helping the people in the best possible way by enabling them to help themselves . If they failed to struggle upwards , then in the Victorian view the poor might have a claim to private charity but not to any generous assistance from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victorians were very slow to tackle , and which to some extent is still a problem for us to-day , was the effect on people 's health when more and more of them were packed together to live and die in the streets of ever-growing towns . The health conditions of London and other ancient urban centres had been very bad , though mitigated towards the end of the eighteenth century by the work done under the Improvement Acts . The quality of the new industrial towns was worse , with a great mass of shoddy building ( dating often from a period of maximum growth in the ' twenties ) which deteriorated as it grew older . Meanwhile the population was still increasing fast : the Queen 's subjects in the United Kingdom numbered 26 million at the beginning of her reign , 42 million at the end of it . If we exclude Ireland , where the population after the famine of 1846 had declined at every census , the increase is still more remarkable : England , Wales , and Scotland ? in spite of the millions who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had had in 1837 . In 1851 the division between town and country was almost exactly even , but by the end of the century three-quarters of the people lived in the towns and the total of country-dwellers had actually declined by 5 per cent . It was therefore a very important fact that the conditions of town life , which up to the ' sixties were getting worse rather than better , did at last begin to improve , so that the ' seventies brought a decisive fall in the death-rate . The horrors of the earlier years had been eloquently described , not only in several of the widelyread novels of Dickens , but by Disraeli in a story called Sybil or The Two Nations ( the widely-separated nations of the rich and the poor ) and by an earnest German named Engels , the friend and associate of Karl Marx , the founder of Communism . His account  | of The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844 gives an unforgettable picture of Manchester ? grim factories overshadowing dark streets and lanes , the undrained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of black smoke , the malodorous River Irwell swirling underneath the narrow bridges . Twice there had been a big scare , in 1832 and 1848 , when epidemics of cholera in London and the provinces ravaged the homes of rich as well as poor , with the result that Boards of Health were set up by Parliament to see to matters of water supply , drainage , etc . But each time , when the epidemic subsided , health measures were allowed to fall into neglect , even though they were championed by one of the first great civil servants in our history . This was a social reformer as determined as Lord Shaftesbury , but , unfortunately , greatly inferior to the " Children 's Friend " in social influence , sympathy , and tact . Edwin Chadwick Edwin Chadwick ( 1800 ? 90 ) was a native of Manchester , who had much to do with the making of the Poor Law in 1834 and became Secretary to the Poor Law Commission established to carry out the new system . In that connection he visited the worst slums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences led him to press for a government inquiry on Public Health and Housing ; a rise in the number of deaths from typhus made an examination of conditions in London urgent , and the Bishop ( Blomfield ) suggested that it should cover the whole country . So in 1842 , Chadwick published his famous Report on the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population , which revealed the startling fact that owing to insanitary conditions the number of deaths in one year from typhus fever alone was double that of the lives lost by the Allies in the battle of Waterloo . Besides the lack of sanitation there was the evil of overcrowding . In 1840 there were 15,000 persons in Manchester living in cellars . In Liverpool the number was twice as great . To find a parallel Chadwick harked back to gaol conditions in the eighteenth century before they were reformed by John Howard , declaring that " more filth , worse physical suffering and moral disorder than will also be made , aid the " A miserable region of damp , dilapidation , and decay " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before reconstruction under the Act of 1875.  | Howard described as affecting the prisoners , are to be found among the cellar population of the working people of Liverpool , Manchester or Leeds " . Nevertheless , the Board of Health scheme which he succeeded in establishing in 1848 did not include London in its sphere of action ; in other towns it could recommend but not , usually , compel the appointment of a local Health Board ; and for want of support it came entirely to an end in 1854 . Chadwick then turned his attention to more hopeful projects ? omnibuses , postoffice telegraphs , and London University all benefited by his many-sided activities . The reasons for the long delay in tackling the needs of the towns are many and various . We may put first the strength of laissez-faire opinion , that is , the widespread belief ( to which the economic writers of the day contributed ) in leaving things alone . Any government measure was bound to interfere with people 's liberty of doing what they liked with their own property , and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no measure taken , the situation might get better of its own accord or through some private and voluntary work of benevolence . This view was very popular among the well-to-do classes : Punch , for example , saw fit to caricature the public health movement in the guise of a severe nurse trying to scrub a reluctant Master John Bull , with whose reluctance the reader is clearly expected to sympathize . There were powerful vested interests ferry-builders ; landlords of old , deteriorated , but profitable property ; water companies whose affairs ( and water ) would not bear looking into , and so forth ? which made it difficult for town councils and even for M.P . ' s to inquire into the housing conditions of the poor . There was also much genuine ignorance , for the expansion of the towns had been accompanied by the removal of the betterclass homes into " eligible residential areas " , situated usually in the outskirts and distant from the homes of the workers . As ' late as the 1880 's , it was a great novelty when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reside in the poor quarters of London and other large towns . To find out how the workers lived therefore required an effort and a deliberate venturing into strange and disagreeable scenes , for which the hardworked head of a business or professional man had no time , while  | for his women-folk it would be thought unladylike and unsuitable . Many people genuinely believed accounts of slum conditions to be hopelessly exaggerated or , alternatively , accepted them with resignation as originating in the drunkenness , laziness , and folly of the poor . There were many besides his own horse that seemed to agree with Tennyson 's Northern Farmer , when he said : " Take my word for it , Sammy ! The poor in a loomp is bad . " But the biggest difficulty of all lay in the physical facts of the situation . In days when surgeons used to operate in dirty overalls , it is obvious that the connection between dirt and infection was understood but dimly if at all ; and without the modern microscope the influence of a tainted water supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot-water systems were eventually among the greatest gifts of the Industrial Revolution to man , but these objects and others like them were still neither cheap nor plentiful in Early Victorian England . In 1832 a bath with a hot-water supply was the latest novelty at the London Mansion House , and we may surely suppose the City Fathers to have budgeted a little more lavishly for the honour of the Lord Mayoralty than for their personal requirements . Therefore , as the crowds poured into the towns it seemed sufficient to subdivide old houses and build new ones , at top speed , without considering that there was any need to improve on the standards of accommodation which had been found adequate by the immigrants before they left their original home , no doubt small and overcrowded , or perhaps a mere hovel on the edge of an Irish peat-bog . A typical village had had no drainage system or artificial water-supply : it took time for men to face up to the fact that , when the equivalent of fifty villages were laid side by side to form some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning had been created , for which our new industrial methods must somehow find a solution . Reforms of the 1870 's Health of towns , fortunately , was not made a party issue . A Royal Commission , the report of which laid down a list of requirements " necessary for civilized social life " , was appointed by Disraeli , completed its work under Gladstone , and had its recom- mendations carried partly by the Liberals , chiefly by the Conservatives . The requirements included : good water , proper drainage , removal of nuisances ( such as excessive noise , smells , and smoke caused by industrial processes ) , healthy streets and houses , measures to prevent the spread of disease . The first step , taken in 1871 , was to establish the Local Government Board to supervise all " local government " . The novelty of its work is shown by the fact that the phrase itself had only been coined a dozen years before . Then in 1875 a Public Health Act laid down rules for sanitation which all owners of houses had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer of health , a surveyor , and a sanitary inspector , and it might provide a water-supply for its area unless this was already provided efficiently by a private company . Sewers must be maintained in good condition ; the making , paving , cleaning and lighting of the streets must be attended to and scavengers must be employed to collect refuse regularly . Other duties of the sanitary authorities included the supervision of markets and slaughter-houses ; and their inspectors had the right to seize and destroy unsound food . They might , if necessary , provide public baths and wash-houses . The medical officers must take proper measures to prevent the spread of infectious diseases . Later , the inspectors were also empowered to examine the sanitary conditions of workshops . Some cities had already taken the initiative in these matters . Liverpool had appointed a medical officer as early as 1847 . London got its first medical officer in 1848 ; Manchester came next in 1869 ; Birmingham also had its first medical officer already at work in 1875 . But the whole basis of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant to adopt health measures were often those where they were most needed . In the same year as the Health Act , the Artisans ' Dwellings Act gave local authorities power to condemn , clear , and redevelop slum areas . Mention has already been made of the great work undertaken at this time in Birmingham , though this required the help of a special Act of Parliament . But Birmingham did not stand alone . Manchester had a similar big clearance scheme in Deansgate under another private Act of 1869 . Liverpool in the ' eighties was prominent in getting rid of cellar residences ; Leeds ,   rather later , tackled the back-to-back houses for which it was specially notorious . In London the Metropolitan Board of Works , soon to be superseded by the London County Council , in eight years secured the rehousing of 28,352 persons ? less than 1 per cent of population , but a beginning . Established in 1855 , this now longforgotten local authority had already provided London with its main drainage system and the Victoria Embankment , under which one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1875 was the Sale of Food and Drugs Act . This tackled the problem , not peculiar to towns , of articles prepared from injurious and falsely described ingredients ; the law made arrangements for inspection and analysis of samples and was not greatly altered until 1928 . In this connection it must not be forgotten that the Education Act of 18701 played a part by making people less ignorant and on the whole less gullible . Universal elementary education also stimulated the activities of the town councils : people could understand more readily what was being done for their benefit and therefore co-operate ? they could also understand what was not being done , and therefore agitate . The provision of parks and recreation grounds , for instance , the socalled " lungs of the great cities " , now went ahead without much prompting by Parliament , and the growth of education certainly encouraged the growth of municipal art galleries , museums , and libraries , and ? in some enlightened neighbourhoods ? the use of local government powers to make towns less ugly . Not all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the erection of municipal buildings on the grand scale often marked the moment when a town began to take a new pride in its appearance . ' Medicine Although the provision of a complete public health service in the modern sense was utterly beyond the imaginations of the contemporaries of Gladstone and Disraeli , the " shilling doctor " of the poorer quarters of the town , no less than the up-to-date physician visiting the rich in his brougham , had an important   cumulative effect on public health . It has already been mentioned that medical training provides an exception to the general rule of indifference to the need for scientific education . Between 1818 and 1831 medical schools were established in Bristol , Manchester , Sheffield and Leeds , and interest in the subject also revived at Oxford and Cambridge . By the end of the century every industrial area had its quota of qualified medical practitioners ; the type is described for us from first-hand knowledge in the novels of Francis Brett Young and A. J. Cronin . Meanwhile surgeons were faced still with two old but formidable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was operated on without anaesthetic , the other was the blood-poisoning which so often set in after operation , wound or accident . Various experiments in the use of gases to limit pain had been made , including some by Davy and Faraday . Eventually Professor J. Y. Simpson of Edinburgh himself inhaled a number of vapours , and in 1847 he found that chloroform was the most useful . It soon came into general use as the first anaesthetic . The other problem was made worse by the crowding of patients into hospital wards , especially when the hospitals were old and dirty . The connection between dirt and disease was scarcely suspected , and so infection spread easily on the hands of doctors and nurses and from patient to patient . Blood-poisoning , or hospital gangrene as it was called , was so deadly that it was safer to be treated at home than to go to hospital . In the 1840 's Semmelweiss in Austria and Oliver Wendell Holmes ( doctor as well as writer ) in America practised and advocated the use of antiseptic materials in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and made no impression at the time . Later the French scientist Pasteur ( 1822-95 ) , working on fermentation and decomposition in connection with brewing and wine-making , discovered that these processes were caused by living organisms or germs , and that these germs came from the air . Joseph Lister ( 1827-1912 ) , who was professor of surgery at Glasgow and Edinburgh , realized in 1865 that such germs must also be the cause of blood-poisoning . By using antiseptics to destroy germs ? by sterilizing hospital equipment and treating wounds ? he revolutionized surgery and , though his methods are now outmoded , he first made it compara- tively safe . His great work was recognized when he was made Lord Lister in 1897 . Every improvement in hospital practice was powerfully assisted by the long-maintained influence of Florence Nightingale ( 1820-1910 ) . By her work during the Crimean War and afterwards in England , she made a revolution in hospital administration and in nursing . She raised the standard of cleanliness in hospitals and she did much to make nursing a regular and respected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1880 onwards a number of the germs , or bacteria , causing diseases were isolated and studied , and means of counteracting them discovered . The use of soap and water to secure household and personal cleanliness , new methods of avoiding contamination of food , and the process of pasteurization of milk to destroy bacteria , have all furthered improvement in health . To attack bacteria directly in the human body is , however , difficult by means of antiseptics : they destroy the bacteria but may also destroy or harm the patient . But the old method of inoculation was further developed by Pasteur , who treated hydrophobia by inoculation with a weakened form of the rabies virus . Another method is to inject a blood-serum from an infected animal , and not the living organism of the disease . Thus in 1890 a German doctor discovered a serum which could be injected against tetanus , and in 1892 a serum or anti-toxin was prepared for immunization against diphtheria . As a result tetanus was very greatly reduced in war wounds and diphtheria , once the scourge of childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time the County of London recorded not a single death from this cause . Below the Poverty-Line Improvements in medicine and higher standards of sanitation , hygiene , and building practice combined to produce a fall in the death rate , which was approximately halved in fifty years . The decline was slower in the first half of the period ( 1875-1900 ) , but even then it was commonly believed that reasonably healthy conditions of town life were at last assured . That this , alas ! was   not so was shown , to the general surprise , by a remarkable book on The Life and Labour of the People of London , of which the first volume was published in 1889 . The author , Charles Booth , a retired Liverpool shipowner , collected full details , by door-todoor inquiry in carefully chosen " sample " areas , of how people lived ? wages , rent , size of family , regularity of employment , etc . What he discovered was that no less than 30 per cent of the population of the world 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , the food , clothing , and shelter which they could buy with their earnings were not sufficient to keep them in proper physical condition . Clearly , for those 1,200,000 souls the metropolis must be a place of ill-health and misery or dumb despair ; the legislation for the betterment of town life completely passed them by . It was thought and hoped that these dreadful statistics applied to London alone , but a dozen years later a similar inquiry at York , a city which was neither particularly large nor particularly poor , gave a corresponding figure of 28 per cent ? and this was believed to have been calculated more exactly than Booth 's . This established the fact that all our industrial towns must contain , chiefly in the families of the unskilled workers , a mass of people who never had a chance to live even physically satisfactory lives . The problem was perhaps at its worst in the large ports , crowded with Irish immigrants and destitute foreigners , such as the Jews fleeing from persecution in Russian Poland . But another class of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the farm labourers . Their pay was about half that of a factory hand ; their hours of work were unlimited ; and their whole life was passed under the often tyrannical eye of the farmer by whom they were employed . The efforts of Parliament and local authorities had largely got rid of the squalor and disease , if not of the drabness and boredom , which had made the early Victorian town a wretched place even for the craftsman and factory worker in steady employment . Rising wages had helped them on , so that in the ' nineties this class was sure that progress had been made : for them Victorian comfort was no illusion . But it was left for the twentieth century to begin the task of pulling up the " submerged tenth " , now found to be nearer three-tenths , for which the Victorian world planned no
