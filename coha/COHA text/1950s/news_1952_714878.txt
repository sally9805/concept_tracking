txt The American Legion flooded Fifth Avenue with a tide of sound and color yesterday as it staged its annual convention parade  --  a tide that flowed unbroken for nine hours and thirty-nine minutes . Sound swelled from the deep . hroated brasses of the bands , from the shrill-piping flutes of the drum corps . Color shone in the uniforms of the 75,000 marchers , the flags they carried and the floats beside which they trudged . It was a gala show . The parade got under way at 10:06 A. M. from Thirty-first Street . The New York delegation , last in line , passed the reviewing stand at Sixty-fourth Street at 7:45 P. M. Three million persons , according to the estimate of Police Commissioner George P. Monaghan , saw the spectacle . They saw it under ideal weather conditions  --  a cloudless sky and just enough breeze to keep the flags waving . It was actually . cool in the shade of the Central Park trees on the avenue 's west side .
