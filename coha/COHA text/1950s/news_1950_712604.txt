S. industry to invest in her reviving industry and at the same time obtain for herself sorely-needed technical " know-how " That is one of the two main goals of the present Japanese government , according to Takeshi Watanabe. financial commissioner , and the No. 2 man in the nation 's Ministry of Finance . Mr. Watanabe is currently here en route from Tokyo to the east coast to study American private and government financial methods .

All the indexes show our economy is on the right track . " Mr. Watanabe says The second big hurdle which the government is trying to clear is establishment of a tax program attractive to foreign capital .
