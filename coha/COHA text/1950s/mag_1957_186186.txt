The number of patients in the nation 's mental hospitals has been rising steadily for many years , at present totals about 800,000 . Last week the National Mental Health Committee announced that in 1956 this " seemingly inevitable rise " was reversed for the first time . The total number of state-hospital patients for 1956 was about 7,000 under the 1955 count-despite the fact that 1956 was a record year for mental-hospital admissions ( 186,000 , or 8,000 more than in 1955 ) . <P> The reverse proved a point that doctors have been making all along : many mental patients can be restored to society if states will only spend the money for intensified treatment and more personnel . The average daily expenditure for each state mental patient has risen since 1945 from $1.06 to $3.26 , the ratio of employees to patients from one for every 6.8 to one for every 3.6 . Though these figures are still woefully low , the rise has made it possible to treat more patients rather than just maintain them . With the impact of the tranquilizer drugs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharging from 65% to 80% of first admissions . The committee 's forecast : the trend will continue .
