What picture of the U.S. do Britons get from the British press ? Last week , splashed across a tabloid page of the Laborite London Daily Mirror , world 's largest daily ( circ. 4,514,000 ) , was a headline : THE CLIMATE OF FEAR . Below was an article by Mirror Reporter William Connor , just returned from the U.S. A congressional investigation , wrote Connor in a fantastic comparison , " reminds you of the Communist trials , the horrible . . . Slansky affair in Prague , the grisly Mindszenty farce and a dozen other dismal puppet shows on the other side of the Iron Curtain . " <P> A few days before , Britons had been treated to an equally hair-raising story by the London Sunday Pictorial 's Special Correspondent Ralph Champion , who had been sent to find out for the Pictorial 's 5,170,000 readers what the U.S. is really like . " It is horrifying , " wrote Champion , who had set foot on U.S. shores for the first time just five days before , " to find everyone in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced forms . " Correspondent Champion found bombproof safe-deposit boxes " strictly for dollars ... no humans need apply , " a Broadway " populated with sex-mad morons , " and " one advertisement everywhere : Blood donors wanted . High cash payments given on the spot . " ( Champion admitted later that " everywhere " was actually only in small classified ads . ) <P> " It is a bad sign , " reported Conservative M. P. Beverley Baxter in Lord Beaverbrook 's Evening Standard , " when American taxi drivers do not engage a stranger in conversation . This time the canaries did not sing . . . When I asked a friend for an explanation , he answered that America is haunted by two spectres-war and peace . . . Incidentally , a New Yorker who has lived on the fringe of world affairs . . . suggested to me that Japan might be invited to take over Korea . . . ' Japanese armament shares have had a sharp rise , ' he said suavely . I make no comment on his statement , but merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gangsters . As a result of such wild reporting in Britain 's press many a Briton is led to believe that the U.S. is dominated by Senators Joe McCarthy and Pat McCarran , and that it is a slick , grossly materialistic country populated by bathing beauties , crooners , gangsters and political strong-arm men . Americans have a stereotype of Britain too , says the Manchester Guardian 's U.S. Correspondent Alistair Cooke , but it is usually a flattering picture of " Shakespeare , dignified gentlemen , and so on , " while Britons , from their press , often think the U S is made up of " jukeboxes , gangsters and glistening bathing beauties . " A false image is being projected , " wrote London Sunday Observer Correspondent Alastair Buchan , " of an America where liberals are hounded with bell , book and candle and where people who hold unpopular opinions are afraid to open their mouths . " <P> Some British newsmen blame the limited British coverage of the U.S. on the newsprint shortage . It follows , they insist , since British papers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the U.S. But every time paper rationing is eased , British dailies use the extra newsprint to add more entertainment and feature news .
