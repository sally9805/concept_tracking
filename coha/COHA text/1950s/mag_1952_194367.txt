" Unity of the Nile Valley " - joining the Sudan to Egypt-has been the Egyptian version of " Remember the Maine " and " Fifty-four Forty or Fight . " For half a century , no clever Egyptian politician would be caught in the open before a crowd without echoing this familiar vote-catching cry . One day last week , Egypt 's strong man of three months , General Mohammed Naguib , who likes to call himself a simple soldier , scratched pen on paper , and the issue and the cry vanished . Instead of insisting on sole control of the Sudan , Naguib agreed to let the Sudanese themselves , operating under a new constitution , decide their own political future . <P> This surprising accord was hammered out in eight days of talks in Cairo with white-bearded , wealthy Sir Abdel Rahman El Mahdi of Sudan. * They agreed that the Sudanese should elect a legislative assembly by year 's end , and thereafter practice full home rule under the supervision of the British governor general .

There would be no opportunity to choose dominion status within the British Commonwealth . <P> Nonetheless , in London last week , the Foreign Office was chirpy with pleasure , a sensation its African department had almost forgotten how to feel . The British have long insisted that they are prepared to get out of the Sudan as long as the Sudanese are left to themselves ( and presumably advised discreetly by the British ) . Even better would be an agreement whereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the vulnerable , volatile Middle East . Said the Manchester Guardian : " We should be ready to take the rough with the smooth if we can secure a tolerable way out of what seemed a little time ago to be an impasse . " Said the Economist : " For the first time for very many years an Egyptian statesman has publicly given Great Britain the benefit of the doubt .
