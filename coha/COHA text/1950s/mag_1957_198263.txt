In Veneto , the flat northeastern plain of Italy between the Alps and the Adriatic where once Caesar 's armies stood guard , stands an outpost of the new U.S. Army . It is no sword-shield-and-visor legion of Caesar 's hour ; neither is it the sprawling sea of men and machines that fought the brutal battles of World War II . It is a unique organism , the Southern European Task Force-SETAF-whose job it is to support NATO 's ground armies in that area . A tightly packed , well-trained band of about 6,000 men , SETAF comprises the U.S. Army 's only operative atomic Missile Command in Europe . <P> In SETAF 's hands rest the vital early weapons of the Atomic Age : the rocket Honest John and the guided missile Corporal ; the vast , complicated network of control panels and radar screens and radio beams that will aim and fire the supersonic Corporal at an enemy perhaps 200 miles away ; the surprisingly agile 30-ton missile-carrying trucks ; the truck-bed cranes called " cherry pickers " and the devastating wallop itself : atomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready for tomorrow 's atomic war . <P> Science in the Defiles . SETAF stakes its job in a three-point pattern . Headquarters , stationed in ancient Verona , and Task Forces Alfa and Bravo , * in Vicenza , are assigned to defend Italy 's northeastern frontier ( Austria and Yugoslavia ) ; about 150 miles to the southwest , at the Italian port of Livorno , is Task Force Sierra , which supplies Alfa and Bravo with everything from carbines to carefully shrouded atomic warheads . If war comes , Alfa and Bravo can take aim on or fan out into the painstakingly mapped passes and defiles of the nearby Alps with astonishing mobility . With the 200,000-man NATO-commanded Italian army moving in to drive an oncoming enemy into a pocket , SETAF efficiently unlimbers its cranes , trucks and crews , loads its rockets and missiles , releases its wallop with discriminating accuracy . <P> But even an offensive force must stand ready for defensive action . Once SETAF has discharged its mighty power , it must move out fast , for the enemy can easily pinpoint the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile equipment , the task forces can shift from their firing position with remarkable speed . <P> Well-Organized Haste . SETAF 's performance depends as much on its human muscle as it does on its scientific punch . SETAF 's commanding officer , California-born Major General Harvey Fischer , is a barrel-chested West Pointer ( ' 32 ) with a snappy mind and a faithful following . From the top brass down , that following is made up of controlled , hardened , carefully honed experts who have sheathed a commonplace soldier 's training in the new technology . <P> Typical is a Memphis sergeant first class named William Kinney , 25 , who studied missilery and electronics in Texas for 28 tough weeks , carries the customary carbine and 20-lb. pack , commands 35 men . The 14 specialists in his group who fire the supersonic Corporal are all familiar with one another 's jobs , can get their hardware into the air in less than an hour after its delivery to their station , then disperse with their rumbling equipment in well-organized haste , set up again elsewhere for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
