Oil tankers of the future may be giant descendants of sausage skins . Two years ago Engineering Professor William Rede Hawthorne of Britain 's Cambridge University got empty sausage skins from his butcher , filled them with alcohol , tied the ends and towed them in the laboratory 's wave tank . The alcohol sausages rode the waves so valiantly that he got financial backing from Esso Petroleum Co. , Ltd. to build and test good-sized flexible barges . <P> Last week the professor demonstrated , in Southampton Water , his latest barge , which he calls a " Dracone , " from a Greek word for serpent . It is 100 ft. long , 5 ft. in diameter , and made of 200 Ibs. of strong nylon fabric and about a ton of synthetic rubber . Partially filled to keep the skin relaxed , it carries 10,000 gallons of fluid and slips through the water like a boneless whale with a flattish top 18 in. above the surface . <P> Dracones have proved to be surprisingly seaworthy . A 67-ft. model was towed out into a full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tug that towed it had to run for shelter . When making a sharp turn , a Dracone does not swing like a ship ; its fabric forms a kink that moves from bow to stern . <P> The economic advantages of Dracones are their cheapness ( about $5,600 for the 100-ft. job ) and the fact that they can be pumped dry at the end of a voyage , rolled up , and shipped back to a source of oil as cargo of a small towing vessel .
