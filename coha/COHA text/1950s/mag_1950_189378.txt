Italy 's prizewinning The Bicycle Thief ( TIME , Dec. 12 ) , one of the screen 's most widely acclaimed films , has been called honest , moving and classic . It remained for sharp-eyed Hollywood Censor Joseph Breen , who administers the industry 's production code , to call it indecent and unacceptable for the bulk of U.S. moviegoers . Last week the picture 's sponsors were fighting Breen 's edict that the movie must be cut before it can go from the art theaters into most U.S. cinemansions . <P> Breen demanded two cuts : 1 ) the shot of the little boy " about to make his toilet against the wall " and 2 ) all the interior shots of a bordello into which the hero chases the thief . <P> In Milan , Director Vittorio De Sica was " astounded . " To Joseph Burstyn , the film 's U.S. distributor , he cabled : " Picture circulates successfully whole world including England without ever meeting similar demands . As to girls ' house scene , critics everywhere have stressed the delicate way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene , once more its spirit and execution have been judged everywhere simply candid . May I recall that noble religious town of Brussels , Belgium , emblem is boy in said circumstances whose statue stands in one of its squares . " Taking up the argument , Burstyn charged " a subtle form of sabotage . " He pointed out that the cuts demanded by Breen would entail gouging hundreds of more feet out of the picture to have its continuity make sense . <P> By still another yardstick , the Breen order seemed somewhat strange . As an outraged American Civil Liberties Union quickly noted , the production code office 's parent body , the Motion Picture Association of America , was waging a legal fight against movie censorship by states and cities . Yet The Bicycle Thief already had passed muster with the official censors of New York , Pennsylvania and Ohio. * Was the M.P.A.A. trying to be more censorious than the very censorship boards it was opposing ? Distributor Burstyn planned an appeal to the M.P.A.A. 's directors and beyond them to the U.S. public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offended Breen but ordered only a few seconds snipped from each - and only for Sunday showings . On weekdays in Boston , the original version is shown .
