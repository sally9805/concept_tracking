When Queen Elizabeth ( above ) and Prince Philip saw their first American football game Saturday , it is doubtful that they realized Maryland 's 21-7 victory over North Carolina was one in a series of upsets which rocked the thrones of the football mighty , from the staid Ivy League through the brawling Midwest and on out to the schizoid Pacific Coast Conference , The Queen watched the game with queenly dignity and , by the end of the game , had asked enough questions to pick up roughly the same knowledge of football as a one-game-a-year alumnus ' wife . University of Maryland President Bull Elkins , who instructed her on the fine points , found only one of her questions very difficult to answer : " Where do your players come from ? " Said he , " All over . " // By late Saturday night no coach in the country had felt impelled to blow his brains out ( see cartoon ) , but more than a few must have considered the idea seriously . That was notably the case of Michigan State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare distinction of having his team rated over Oklahoma nationally , then watched that rating plummet as a Purdue team jolted his Spartans into 10 fumbles , recovered five of them and converted two of the recoveries into touchdowns for a 20-13 upset . Such , too , was the case with Minnesota 's Murray Warmath as Illinois , teased into fury during the week by Coach Ray Eliot 's shuffling of first-team personnel to the second for " poor play , " took out its pique on the fourth-ranked Gophers 34-13 . But the Hawkeyes of Coach Forest Evashevski , the Iowa iconoclast , followed form as they blocked out a 21-7 victory over Wisconsin ; another formful team was Indiana , whose coach , Bob Hicks , told newsmen at a Friday practice , " Gentlemen , you 're looking at the world 's tallest midgets . " Saturday the midgets lost , 56-0 , to Ohio State . In the West , Teacher Red Sanders gave a postgraduate lesson to Pupil Tommy Prothro ( a former assistant ) as UCLA toppled Oregon State 26-7. // King for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose strong running was one of the big factors in the 34-13 upset the Illini handed Minnesota Saturday . Gaping holes like the one below gave Mitchell running room , and the senior back time and again split the Gopher defense with slithering , slippery runs . Here he dances through a huge gap in the Minnesota line to score the third Illinois touchdown , with not a tackier in sight who is standing up . // Regicide resulted from plays like these as Purdue unceremoniously dethroned football 's top-ranked Michigan State 20-13 . Fullback Bob Jaurus ( 36 ) went up and over a knot of Spartan tacklers to score from the one-yard line in the second period . The Purdue victory could be traced largely to the Boilermaker line play , which not only banged the Spartans into 10 costly fumbles , but stopped Michigan State 's running with only 115 yards , rushed Spartan Quarterback Jim Ninowski so hard he lost 36 yards attempting to pass , and squelched three Spartan attempts to run on fourth down . It also paved the way for the Purdue backs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast , found its position usurped by underdog UCLA Saturday , had to wait until the fourth quarter before Jim Stinnette ( 37 ) finally climbed over this stack of humanity for the first OSC touchdown . But UCLA , playing safe , unspectacular football and waiting for the Beavers to make the mistakes , scored early and reasonably often to upset the defending Pacific Coast champions 26-7 . Oregon State Coach Tom Prothro , who once was assistant to UCLA 's Red Sanders , had no difficulty in explaining the thundering upset succinctly : " They blocked better , they ran better , they passed better . They were superior in every department . " // This gravel road was the way to victory for Iowa 's Hawkeyes as they pounded out a methodical 21-7 triumph over previously undefeated Wisconsin . Behind the tremendous blocking which characterized the Iowa attack all afternoon , Bill Gravel ( 14 ) , stubby Iowa halfback , heads for daylight . The street-sweeping ahead of Gravel is being carried on by Fullback John Nocera ( 33 ) , Guard Bob Commings ( 50 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's fullback , Bob Zeman ( 34 ) . The Iowa defense contained Wisconsin 's speedy halfbacks  --  Danny Lewis and Sid Williams  --  admirably all afternoon as the ends turned sweeps back into the middle , where Tackles Alex Karras and Dick Klein could ambush them . Gravel gained only four yards on the excursion above , but later he returned an intercepted pass 44 yards for a touchdown as Iowa remained unbeaten . // The eyes have it here as Marvin Lasater of Texas Christian ( 23 ) eyes a hole in the Texas A&amp;M line and Ken Beck ( 72 ) of A&amp;M pokes his finger into the eye of would-be blocker Jimmy Shofner ( 22 ) . Beck 's unusual defensive tactic was effective enough for him to shake his blocker long enough to make the tackle on Lasater after a three-yard gain . Leading the play is Texas Christian Fullback Buddy Dike ( 38 ) ; the young man being forcibly erased from the picture at top is A&amp;M 's fullback Dick Gay ( 30 ) , the victim of some neat team play by Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Texas A&amp;M struggled to a 7-0 victory against a TCU team which moved the ball all afternoon but could not score . Said A&amp;M Coach Bear Bryant , " We went at ' em head on and they rose up to meet us . You could hear the licks out there . " // Hoist with his own petard was Utah Coach Jack Curtice , who , by example , made the forward pass popular in the Skyline Conference ( see next page ) . Here Denver 's Steve Meuris hauls in a long pass from Al Yanowich for a 40-yard gain which extricated Denver from a deep hole in the third period . Trailing Meuris futilely is Stuart Vaughan , Utah halfback . Denver went on to upset the favored Utes 12-7 , relying on a bristling line to keep Utah 's aerial offense off balance all afternoon . Icy-cold weather kept the crowd down and may also have had something to do with the inaccuracy of the Utah passing attack . Adding insult to injury , Denver 's first touchdown came on the heels of a pass interception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Denver scored quickly on a pass of its own . Curtice may come to regret his advocacy of the aerial game .
