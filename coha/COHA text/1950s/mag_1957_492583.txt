. By NOEL BARBER BEIHAN , ON THE ADEN-YEMEN FRONTIER , 7ihr Sharif of Beihan , a grizzly-bearded gentleman in a green skirt , white jacket , brown at the edges , and the only man wearing shoes , analyzed the whole war sternly and succinctly . " Things are getting worse . In the past three months we have suffered casualties  --  two killed , one wounded , four hundred stolen . " " Stolen ? You mean prisoners ? " I asked . The interpreter gave an apologetic cough . ' ? My fault , " he added hastily . should have said four hundred goats stolen . " And that about sums up the oddest little war in the world , a war that started on this vicious , arid mountainous frontier 2000 years ago and has been going on steadily ever since . Though now the quarrel is virtually between Britain and the Yemen , it is still at heart a war of blood feuds between savage tribes who still come out after the sunset prayer , fighting barefoot , often in loincloths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down their backs . The night before I wrote this they loosed off hundreds of rounds at this isolated British Royal Air Force camp where I am staying , then melted back into the indigo night . And on this occasion  --  as on nearly every occasion  --  not a soul got hurt . Both sides blazed like merry hell for half an hour and then settled down to sleep . The war was over for another night . I have now flown this frontier dozens of times : I have jeeped with patrols over hundreds of miles of wicked border country ; and I have stayed at three front-line battle stations . And though at times we were attacked by maniacal hordes of tribesmen 500 strong , all rifle-armed , I have never seen a casualty . One bullet whined through a sleeping tent one night , that 's all . The casualties at Beihan arc the first I had heard of fur weeks . And yet one day soon this crazy war in which hardly anybody gets hurt could be a major U.N . headache . For this sandbagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet above the sea and surrounded by cruel , jagged volcanic peaks that soar 5000 feet or more  --  this camp is on the frontier that separates the Protectorate of Aden from the Yemen . one of the world 's most backward lands . Here the guns splutter every night as the tribesmen scramble down the weird , futuristic mountains of geological clinker to the sandy wadis that were once the ancient route of the spice and frankincense trade . ( Continued on Page MS ) ( Continued from Page 33 ) Here , along this border , Nasser  --  aided gleefully by the Kremlin  --  is staging a show of strength in his hid to be master of the Arab world . It is hard for me to believe this as I report this war , for of all the quarters of the globe 1 have visited , this is the most desolate , the most backward , the most pitiful . It is scourged by periodical famine , it is racked by disease , it has an infant-mortality rate of 15 per cent . Only I per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked a villager who carried my bags what he would like me to give him . He answered , " Master , a tin of pineapple . " For the tribesman it is mostly arid desert ; so , automatically , for the leaders of Soviet Russia it is fertile gi-ound . But though outside factions greedily foster unrest , there are few areas in the world where conditions have changed so little in 2000 years . Here the unwritten tribal law still obtains in the lonely villages . In one week I saw three men whose right hands had been cut off  --  still to many the only recognized way to punish the thief . " And in some villages : * added the interpreter modestly , " it is still regarded as reasonable to throw an adulteress from the highest building . " In the isolated mountain-locked settlements I have visited on patrol the tribal law still demands that a man accused , however flimsy the evidence , must undergo ordeal by fire . His tongue is burned with a red-hot iron , and only if it leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops carry civilian clothes into battle areas because they can not pray in uniform , while tribal chiefs like the sharif need three separate armies to spy on one another . It 's a war , too , in which almost everybody stops fighting between two and eight P.M. because all Yemenese and Adenese tribesmen are drug addicts , chewing a strange narcotic called got at daily six-hour drug orgies . It keeps up the spirit , as 1 shall testify from experience . Yet now the armored cars rattle along the blinding wadis , and overhead , like gulls , the jets dip and dive . Nasser , the Kremlin and oil are etching a local war on the international map . Why ? Better get this cleared up before we go backstage to the private life of a frontier tribesman and an off-duty narcotics binge , After several warring tribes united to form the Yemen , the tribes on the other side of the border signed protection agreements with Britain . That did n't make them a colony  --  it 's important to Tea/in that Aden Protectorate is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles ) at the extreme southwestern tip of Arabia . The tribal rulers of the protectorate arc independent , but Britain looks after their defense  --  and obviously has a big stake in " protecting " Southern Arabia , as it is a perfect cushion to her colony and guards her oil interests . So what was a tribal war has become Yemen vs . Britain . Nasser and Russia foment the trouble . Cairo Radio blares out vicious propaganda ; Russia provides the cash and the arms  --  recently a Russian ship was reported delivering a cargo of automatic rifles for the tribesmen . The Yemen is the cat's-paw  --  the " holier-than-thou " country whose duty it is to " liberate " the tribal chiefs of Aden from the British , Highfalutin theories are one thing , but as well , there is oil , which will probably one day be found in Aden . And remember , every Arab nowadays dreams not of a harem of twenty-five beautiful women but a garage of twenty-five beautiful limousines , which they firmly believe will arrive ten minutes after oil is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Yemenis give dissident tribesmen guns and even send troops across the border in the hope of one day claiming Adenes their own . The tribesmen in actual fact hate the Yemenis  --  they do n't want to be ruled by anybody  --  so they use the rifles to try to grab neighboring land which might one day be oil rich . They attack the British , too , but not necessarily because they are anti-British , though they are becoming more so because of Cairo Radio . No , they tight the British because the age-old tribal laws decree that when you make an agreement with another tribe , you leave a hostage  --  usually a son  --  behind . So the dissident tribesmen leave their sons in the Yemen as the price of a free gun or a bribe , and if they do n't keep up a sporting average of attacks against the British , off conies junior 's head . " So , you see , Mr. Barber , " explained the sharif  --  a title meaning " noble " ? " why I have not slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being bribed away from me by the Yemenis . " That is doubtless why , as we talked , the sharif was guarded by three separate armed forces . We held our Conference in the reception room of his fortress  --  a long room painted shiny green halfway up , like a kitchen , with white above , lit by naked electric bulbs , with eighteen kitchen chairs , three kitchen clocks  --  all different times  --  a safe built into one wall , and a desk for the sharif knocked together out of old planking . On this stood two bright yellow " in " and " out " trays made from old oleo boxes . While slaves  --  yes , there are still slaves around  --  served coffee and lemonade , a dozen tribesmen , unblinking and glum , perched on the chairs . Each carried an enormous dagger and a gun . But could the sharif trust them ? Certainly not , so also present were troops from his private army of mercenaries , distinguished by blood-red turbans . They watched the tribesmen . But can you trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four other guards from an outfit called Civilian Guards that are thinly spread over the whole country , a few to each ruler . They are always posted to areas new to them , and so have no interest in tribal wars . They watched the mercenaries . Might as well be sure  --  especially as these boys are even more ferocious than they look . found that out the first time I came under attack , at Dhala , another trouble spot , where 1 stayed at art Aden Levy camp tucked in a hollow with villages looking down from pyramids of parched yellow rock . The Levies are volunteers from all parts of the protectorate , and are led by British officers , whereas the Civilian Guards obey the tribal chiefs . Now 1 must emphasize that this war is rarely fought at less than 800 yards ' range , but even so , it 's no joke being on the receiving end of a midnight ambush when 500 enemy tribesmen let off ten rounds each . It makes quite a din . I thought all bell was loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapping one around me , went out into the bitterly cold desert night to a machine-gun post . The sky was alive with spurting flames , and , as usual , the camp of 120 native troops and three British officers was heavily outnumbered . It 's true we did have machine guns against fifty-year-old Turkish Sultana April 19 , 1957 109 rifles , It 's true we had gun emplacements and radio communication . But I could n't help wondering what would happen if these half-crazed , pepped-up savages  --  for that 's what they become after their drug parties  --  should rush us . My bet is that a night assault by 500 of them would have caused quite a stir in camp . After the attack , the British took a rare prisoner . He wore a loincloth in which was stuck a jeweled dagger . His torso was bare and dyed indigo , and his face was blackened with a thick paste , while he had a scarlet line dyed down the center parting of his hair , which was tinged with henna and bound up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm he wore a silver bracelet and on his left a wristlet watch . Below the knee of his right leg he had wound a few strands of twisted cotton  --  it is supposed to give extra strength to a man 's limbs . I would have been extremely embarrassed meeting him alone on a dark night . At Dhala I paid my respects to the Emir Sha'aful bin Ali bin Shaif , a fragile little man with matchstick legs , a multicolored skirt and a pea-green blazer over a red pull-over , and with khaki socks held up by visible gems ' garters . He , too , wore shoes . He , too , was guarded by three different forces as we drove toward his home in the center of Dhala , a conglomeration of mud and lava buildings soldered to the mountainside . The emir lived in the biggest house , easily distinguished because all its glassless windows were thickly framed with white . As we approached it across the wadi , the house looked exactly like the face and eyes of a man made up for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the emir or get shot at . I wanted to try some gat ( pronounced eat ) , the narcotic that all tribesmen on both sides chew when they can afford it . Qat only grows at altitudes over 4000 feet and must be chewed fresh , and Dhala has the juiciest in all Aden Protectorate . Over this whole region tribesmen stop fighting for their daily gat party and it 's a far more elaborate affair than a diplomatic cocktail party . I was invited by a Dhala tribesman , loyal to his emir , of course , one Husein bin Ghaleb  --  hereinafter Husein . He collected me around eleven A.M. , after a night of sporadic shooting . He was neatly dressed in a vivid blue skirt , a dirty striped shirt without a collar , his shirttails hanging outside , and a belt in which were stuck two daggers . He had white-rubber tennis shoes , two fountain pens , two watches , and over his shoulder he had slung  --  rather as a Highlander does  --  a heavy shawl . He had a sprig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through an interpreter , who explained that Husein was high ranking and also quite rich because he grew gat on one of the many plantations I saw on the edge of the village , rather like the tea gardens of Ceylon , with the gat growing on small bushes . " There will he no fighting today , " promised Husein ; " it has been arranged so that we can all enjoy ourselves . " Considering I was in the thick of a war , it was quite a day  --  and with quite a hang-over . When we reached Husein 's house , half a dozen friends were wail ing , and here I got my first shock . With the sun at its fiercest in a country where fountain pens literally dry up , Husein blithely announced , " We will now walk four miles very swiftly . " I gulped . Everybody put on all the extra clothes he could find . Wrapped around with heavy shawls , we might have been setting off skating on a frosty night . The sun ate into everything . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we set off at a jog trot straight into the desert ; then , putting and streaming with sweat , returned at the same speed . " I must explain , " said Husein , " that you can not enjoy gat unless you have a really big thirst . Now we will have lunch , with nothing to drink , and then we start . " Husein had apparently an almost daily gat party and so did all the other warlike tribesmen who could afford it  --  a most convenient way of limiting the hours of warfare . " Well , you see , ' ? confided Husein , " fighting is all very well , but if we can arrange when we fight , then we all know how we stand . " He added thoughtfully , " It 's a great pity the British do n't chew gat , too , instead of working so hard at being soldiers . " Just before we started , Husein and his friends went oil to prayers . Happily for theil ' gal parties , the prayer times have been conveniently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We say both our noon and afternoon prayers before starting , " explained Husein , " and sunset and evening prayers when the chewing ends about eight o'clock . " Then they go out fighting . We chewed in Husein 's bed-sitting room on the first floor of his house  --  the wives and kitchen being above . Sprigs of young leaves  --  each sprig about a foot long  --  were wrapped in grass to keep them fresh , and we all sat down , handed the twigs round , pulled off the leaves , which are dark and shiny , like small bay leaves , and chewed them . // They did n't taste bad  --  a trifle bitter , but no more impossible than some cough lozenges I know . You do n't swallow gat : you chew it until it turns into a paste , swallow the saliva . Ilea spit the paste out anywhere  --  though in high-class houses into spittoons . In about two hours Husein 's room looked like it goal shed  --  and smelled like one . The door was strewn with stripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spittoon . But the effect was astonishing  --  not alcoholic at all , just an overwhelming feeling of supreme confidence and ability . Soon the men looked bright-eyed ; then the tongues started wagging , and Husein boasted , Any time we like it , of course , we can beat the t emenis . " And no doubt the Yemenis , chewing madly a few miles from us , were equally boastful . At first I felt a remarkable sense of clarity . Then I , too . became extremely talkative . In no time I was solving the whole Yemen-Aden war , and finally I delighted the tribesmen by changing clothes with one of them  --  a rather rash exercise that necessitated much DDT in camp the next day . There is no doubt qat makes you feel like a superman , but there is also no doubt that it gives you the world 's vilest hang-over. l left Husein at eight o'clock . I remember nothing until I awoke the following morning  --  still with my desert boots on . " What a wonderful way to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and all we have is warm beer . " By now the gar habit has spread to wherever it 's possible to deliver leaves that are still fresh , Even in Aden Colony , which is at too low an altitude for gal to grow , everybody chews it . Every single day of the year a planeload arrives from Ethiopia , where the habit originated , and which produces an enormous quantity . And the British Government ca n't do a thing about it . Nasser is one thing , war is one thing , and the British will hang on to Aden until the end , but they would be kicked out next week if they stopped the people from getting their gar . Naturally the fact that most tribesmen  --  and all Yemenis  --  bold daily gal parties gives the British-led Aden Levies plenty of time when they know there will be no fighting , but these fine Arab troops are rigorously barred from gar chewing , except on /cave . Thus the trick is how to get leave . Since the Levies , despite their discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life as the tribesmen , gal chewing  --  via leave taking  --  is the No. preoccupation in all Levy camps . And as there is no hope of getting a single leaf in camp , you have to get out  --  but how ? The simplest way is to have as many children as possible , since it is absolutely obligatory  --  for religious as well as social reasons  --  to hold a party seven days after a child is born . After Dhala , 1 flew to another lonely Levy camp at a township called Ataq , arriving just as six excited Levie.s were off to baby parties  --  and not on weekend passes , as you might imagine , but for eight whole days . Two days at home  --  the least important thing to them  --  plus three days for traveling each way : and with some qat chewing , I do n't doubt , ten minutes after leaving camp . For the joy of leave has nothing to do with the folks back home . That is incidental to getting gal , " Trouble is , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to hold another beano forty days after the birth , so they 'll probably be off again two or three weeks after they return . It 's a damned odd way to run a war . " Obviously the more children you have , the more gal you get , for if you have a baby a year  --  and why not ? ? then you have two guaranteed compassionate leaves a year . Then you must get the offspring married as soon as possible , for no Arab child gets married unless pop is home for the fiesta . Happily the Levy who loves his gat does n't have too long to wait for the cycle to start , as children sometimes marry around the age of ten . Even in camps right in the thick of the battle areas , the Levies have their own odd customs , as l found at Ataq , when I saw one soldier carefully collecting his hair after a routine camp trim . no " ? the native interpreter was really shocked ? " you must never throw hair away . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nail clippings . " Which is why I saw several soldiers burying their nail clippings on the edge of camp . " lt is very necessary , " explained the interpreter . " The man who is careless with his nail clippings will have to pick them all up with his eyelashes on Resurrection Day . " The Levies wo n't even eat certain things , however good they may be . One day we bought a couple of highly expensive chickens in the local market , Quite a lot of meat was left , but not one mess-boy dared even pick a bone , for the Arab proverb says , and goes on saying , " To eat a chicken makes you chickenhearted , " But at least the Levies keep their women trouble away from camp  --  which is more than tribesmen do . In this crazy war , woman trouble is quite something . It sounds so simple , just to marry four times if you wish . and divorce merely by announcing the fact three tunes . But it is n't . Women are often the direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the husband gets into Yemeni hands  --  the equivalent hereabouts of the moneylender . In one village I met a tribesman whose two wives each insisted on having art entirely new dress each day . They wore their dresses one day and threw them away . Dresses do n't cost much , and among the rich , women sometimes do this , but this poor guy was n't quite so rich as his wives had been led to believe . The Yemenis paid to keep his wives happy . At Ataq , the British grabbed a tribesman called Kathiri  --  indirectly , because his first wife played hell when he quite legally took a second one . " He 's accepted bribes from the Yemenis to plot against us , " a court officer told me . " He just got out of his depth financially . " What happened was that poor old Kathiri , like so many married men , changed his affections after being married live years to only one wife . When he took a second  --  a plump young stripling of thirteen  --  Wife No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , but she was tough enough to insist that Wife No. 2 live in a different house  --  something that does happen here . Kathiri borrowed the money to build the house , Then Wife No . I insisted that at the second wedding ceremony she receive gifts identical with those promised to Wife No. 2 . Lovesick and henpecked , Kathiri just went over the border for the money , leaving a son as hostage . And the emir lost a good fighter to Yemen and love . I was very surprised , once I left Aden Colony  --  where she women hide their faces  --  how often the women were unveiled as I traveled from village to village . At Dhala I saw women with vividly painted yellow faces and their eyebrows and nostrils painted scarlet . Some had a green line drawn down the nose , and all had eyes heavily made up with kohl , the Arabian equivalent of the eyebrow pencil . In another village  --  an extraordinary place where the houses looked like a Manhattan sky line  --  girls had the upper half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They made no attempt to hide their faces as our convoy of armored cars stopped near them . Maybe they were too busy , for the girls usually look after the goats , which in this part of the world are normally perched in thorn bushes . The girls lift them up each morning ; it 's the only chance the goats get to nibble anything other than odd bits of cardboard . Nobody knows how this crazy war will end , if it ever does end . But one thing is certain : what for 2000 years has been a peashooter war , and is still the screwiest war on earth , is now moving swiftly into the political arena . Aden Colony itself is the last British colonial possession near the center of the Arab world , and in the minds of most people , and certainly all Arabs , the protectorate is identified with it . It can not hope to escape the Communist-inspired Nationalist ferment that is sweeping this oil-rich area . Back in Aden , where perspiring young subalterns put on black ties and go dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting cards on silver trays , the Aden-Yemen frontier war may still be regarded as small stuff , But the truth is that even with jets and armored cars , the British are politically fighting a rear-guard action against the half-naked men who creep out after sundown , paid and armed by Nasser and the Kremlin to take pot shots at the British Raj  --  pot shots that are nightly getting nearer the bull's-eye . And that bull's-eye is well known ; it is Nasser 's avowed aim to get the last white man out of Arabia and whole Middle East .
