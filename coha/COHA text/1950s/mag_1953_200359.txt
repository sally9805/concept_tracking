In Hollywood , every smog used to have its silver lining , but nowadays the lining is not even tinfoil . With TV competition rampant , and enough talent unemployed to fill a dozen De Mille epics . Hollywood is escaping into the past . Aging cine-moguls such as Mack Sennett , King Vidor and Adolph Zukor are publishing reminiscences about the good old days , studios are remaking old hits ( e.g. , The Covered Wagon and Ben Hur ) , production schedules read like mail-order history ( Demetrius and the Gladiators , Prince Valiant ) . But the most startling forays into the past occur at Hollywood 's quainter eating and drinking places . <P> At the " Roman Room " of a restaurant named Sasha 's Palate , the tired moviemaker can lie down to a juicy buffalo steak , in what Hollywood considers Roman fashion . Upon entering the candlelit , gold-draped room , the diners toss their shoes into a basket and recline on a five-foot-wide divan which stretches around the walls . Sinking into a sea of pillows ( 45 in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden , the guests are served by waitresses dressed in silky purple pantaloons and boleros . In addition to buffalo steak , Sasha 's offers such items as suckling pig ( dressed with lemon in mouth , maraschino cherries in eyes ) , lamb , baby goat , pheasant and partridge . Price of a meal : $6.50 up . Among the regular Romans , some of whom like to wear togas for the occasion : Robert Cummings , Ray Milland . Lucy and Desi Arnaz . Explains Sculptor-Restaurateur Atanas Katcha-makoff : " The Roman Room gives people a chance to be aristocrats , be elemental , to enjoy themselves like before the last days of Pompeii . " <P> The Bohemia Club , dedicated to the age of chivalry , boasts more than 40 members , all of whom go through an elaborate system of probation , starting as pilgrims and gradually working up to burgher , squire and knight . They bear special names : e.g. , a Hollywood physician is known as Knight Hypocrates or the Pill Peddler . Members carry swords and wear helmets , use what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for eat , " torch " for cigar ) , and engage in musical and beer-drinking contests . In the works : a club house with moat and drawbridge . <P> The Vikings , a drinking society , meets at a Sunset Strip restaurant , numbers among its members Victor Borge , Lauritz Melchior , Michael Wilding . The Vikings wear horned helmets and bearskin robes , and on special occasions blow an ancient Bavarian mountain horn . Their motto : " Work is the ruin of the drinking classes . "
