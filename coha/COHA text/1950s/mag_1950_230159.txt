Dance Me a Song ( produced by Dwight Deere Wiman ) is a professional-looking revue that uses an amateur-night technique . All sorts of people have " entered " individual songs and sketches in the show ; and whether from too many cooks , or mere incompetent cooking , Dance Me a Song makes very thin broth . For awhile it can just manage to be termed uneven ; by the end , there is no kinder word than weak . The show boasts a batch of sprightly and likable young people , including Dancer Joan McCracken . But youth at the prow can seldom prosper without ability in the engine room . The show has some pleasantly simple dance numbers , but more that are noisy and elaborate . One or two songs are nice enough to listen to , but there are none worth talking about . The sketches , always the most important part of a revue , are by &; large the deadliest part of this one . <P> Two spoofs about radio deserve a mild hand . Wally Cox , a young monologuist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheer . By means of a quiet Will-Rogersish manner and a sharp Ring-Lardnerish pen , he creates a couple of monstrously matter-of-fact characters that are both hilarious and appalling . <P> Alive and Kicking ( music by Hal Borne , Irma Jurist &; Sammy Fain ; lyrics by Paul Francis Webster &; Ray Golden ; produced by William R. Katzell &; Mr. Golden ) turns bright just often enough to accentuate its general dullness . It is a mussy show ; its acts do n't move in procession , they merely pile up like wash . It is also a mechanical show ; it behaves as though the right proportion of songs , skits and dance numbers were just as good as the right kind . <P> The songs , studded with lines like " Now that I have found you , " all sound the same and all sound banal . Jack Cole 's wriggly , exotic dances are all much the same too , and elaborately meaningless , but they are sometimes decidedly clever . The skits and satiric ditties vary enormously . Many need the ax , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use manicure scissors . But there are funny things in a take-off of a book-and-author luncheon , the plight of a man who has sworn off cigarettes , and a parody of a sentimental French chanteuse . Assisting-usually at their peril-are Comics David Burns and Jack Gilford , and Lenore ( Junior Miss ) Lonergan . Now grown up , Actress Lonergan should make a good comedienne when she gets the right comedy .
