txt CIO steelworkers whooped uo a new strike threat today and received warm support in their steel industry wage battle from two more administration stalwarts . Both Vice I President Alben I Barkley and Le- Tobin bor Secretary Maurice Tobin expressed all-out sympathy with the workers in speeches to a raucous confetti strewn session at the union 's convention here . More than 2.500 delegates shouted approval of a resolution indorsed by Philip Murray , United Steelworkers union and CIO president , which declared that the 650 , - 000 workers in the basic steel industry wo n't stay on the job " indefinitely " without a pa y boost . They 're on Union 's Side Tobin said that since both the industry and the union had presented their co If:tiding wage increase views to the government 's wage stabilization board and the board 's ultimate recommendations had been accepted by the union , but rejected by the industry , he was on the union 's side . Barkley said : " It is un-American for any group or any interests to defy or to deny or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle these matters . as it is to defy the verdict of a jury in a court of justice in this country . " Barkley made no reference to the fact that WSB labor dispute recommendations are not binding on either side . The Vice President denied that . the government has " sought to do a special favor for labor " but maintained it has only ' tied " to see that every laboring man has justice and equality in the solution of his problems . " hopes They Witt a Victory Barkley , whose talk was spiced with jokes vigorously applauded by his audience , wound up expressing hope that the union eventually would win a " victory " satisfactory to its members . Convention action on the resolution was accompanied by a mass demonstration of de le gates , swarming over the convention platform yelling , shooting fire crackers , and shouting , " No contract , no work " and " We shall not be moved . " no union speakers gave no indication of a date for the strike and another industry shutdown . The strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government seizure with workers technically employes of the government and thus legally barred from walkout . Legality of President Truman 's seizure action is being contested , however , before the sunreme court . Text of Resolution After delegate followed delegate to the floor for hours with bitter haranguing that " well hit the bricks " and " shut the steel industry down until hell freezes over , " the convention unanimous- ? ly adopted the resolution declaring , the dispute must be " promptly resolved " or else : " We can not and will not continue indefinitely to work in 1952 ? for 1950 wages and working conditions ; we can not and will not continue Indefinitely to work without satisfactory collective bargaining contracts . " Tohio , former Massachusetts ViyerRo ! i%Whp1$Ad.Previously kept . ; 111 out of the steel dispute , jumped into it with both feet . He said he " stood heart and soul and spirit " with Murray 's union . Tobin said he remained silent while the steel wage dispute was pending before the government 's wage stabilization board for a recommended solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the union has accepted its recommendations and the industry has not , I do n't feel any obligation to be impartial any more . " The labor secretary thereupon gave a blanket indorsement of the union 's position and maintained that the steel industry could afford to give the workers the WSB 's entire 26 cent hourly wage boost package and still make good profits . " If the steel industry grants all the recommendations of the wage stabilization board , if it takes the $3 a ton price increase authorized under the Capehart amendment , and if it computes the saving that would result in its excess profits tax , " Tobin said , " the actual cost to the steel industry in dollars and cents would be less than 65 cents4a ton . This differs from industry esti- , Mates . Steelmakers have said they would have to increase prices as much as 612 a ton to pay for the WSB proposals and still retain their present rate of profits . Small Price , Secretary Says " That 's a small price for an industry to pay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would cripple the nation 's defense effort and in the interest of keeping the wages of the men who make its steel at a level of decency . " Typical of delegate speeches were the shouted words of Sam Camens of Youngstown , O. : " That little three-day strike we had recently was just a dress reliearsal of what we 'll have to do some day . " Camens said he was sure workers would shut the steel mills ? from coast to coast , " within an hour , within minutes " in the event of a Supreme court ruling ' that the existent seizure is illegal . . President Truman has indicated : that if seizure is validated he will order a pay raise into effect even ' over industry objections . ? " We are going to shut the inAustry down , let it rot until hell freezes over , " warned Clarence jloyster , an Inland Stee company union leader from Gsry , Ind . Murray , finally gaveling the convention to order , posed for ' hotografers and then told the ' delegates : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sins memorable demonstration , that it now has - its answer as to how the union : feels about the present dispute and what the membership must : have if this dispute is to be settled . " MURRAY NO STEEL WORKER Philip Murray , boss of the CIO United Steelworkers union and . possibly the most powerful man in America 's vital steel industry , has never been a steel worker . lie entered the industry as a labor organizer . His experience as a worker had been in the mining industry . Born in Scotland nearly 66 years ago , Murray left school when he was 10 to work in a coal mine . His father was president of the miners ' local union . Unionism was impressed on him early . His father took him to a union meeting when he was 6 . The family emigrated to the United States when Murray was 16 . They settled near Pittsburgh . Murray returned to the mines and within two years was an official of the United Mine Workers of America . He became a naturalized United States citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which elected John L. Lewis president of the miners for the first time also named Murray vice president . For the next 22 years Lewis and Murray worked together in a close and friendly partnership . Since 1942 , however , the two men have been enemies . ' Murray became a factor in the steel industry in 1936 when Lewis selected him to manage a campaign to organize the steel workers . As chairman of the steelworkers organizing committee , Murray masterminded the bitter and sometimes bloody battle to organize the nation 's steel mills . His stature as a labor leader increased to such a point that when Lewis gave up the presidency of the Congress of Industrial Organizations in 1940 , Murray succeeded him . Lewis had quit in a pique because his candidate for President , the late Wendell Willkie , was not elected . Completes Break with Lewis The bushy browed miners ' boss apparently had expected to run the CIO thru his former lieutenant , but Murray refused to accept Lewis ' dictation . Murray 's position was further strengthened when the United Steelworkers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray 's organizing committee . Murray became its first president . He is expected to be reelected at the convention now in session at Philadelphia . The break between Lewis and Murray became complete in 1942 when Lewis led his miners out of the CIO . Murray does not draw a salary as president of the CIO , but he receives $25,000 a year from the Steelworkers union . Despite his background as a miner , Murray 's leadership in the steel unions has not been seriously challenged . As president of the CIO , however , he faces strong competition from Walter Reuther , aggressive leader of the United Automobile Workers union , Loyal to Truman Murray 's skill as a union politician is expectet to save his dominant position , alai ? he has been hampered by illness . The steel ) workers ' boss is also active in national politics . He is one of the ' chief supporters of the CIO political action committee . His adherence to the late Franklin D. Roosevelt largely was the cause of his early estrangement from Lewis who turned against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray maintained his allegiance to the Democratic administration when President Truman succeeded Mr. Roosevelt . President Truman 's seizure of the steel mills and his refusal to invoke the Taft-Hartley act are believed by many to be dictated by Murray . The foreign born former miner , Washington observers concede , has it within his power to jeopardize the nation 's future by exercising his throttlehold on the steel industry .
