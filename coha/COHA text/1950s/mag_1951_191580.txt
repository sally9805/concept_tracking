At Kunu last December , Colonel Paul Freeman , 43 , silver-haired commander of the 23rd U.S. Infantry Regiment , covered the Eighth Army 's retreat . At Wonju in January , the 23rd hung on . At Chipyong last week , Freeman and his men held down the hot corner again . With them was a tough French battalion commanded by Lieut . Colonel Ralph Monclar , a Foreign Legion veteran who had given up his general 's rank to take his men to Korea . <P> Attacking Chinese Reds swarmed down the mountain valleys on both sides of Chipyong , the tip of a precarious but vital U.N . salient . Freeman set up a circular defense perimeter on a low ring of hills , said to his men : " There is no place to go . We are cut off and surrounded . This is a key point of the Eighth Army effort , so we will stay here and kill Chinese . " <P> Tuesday night , three Red Chinese divisions attacked . Mortar , machine-gun and shell fire poured in from Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abated ; cargo planes dropped food and ammunition into the 23rd 's position , while U.N . fighters clawed Red positions with rockets and machine guns . At dusk the Chinese came in again . The 23rd 's ammunition ran low . G.I.s combed the glove compartments of jeeps for spare cartridges . When the Chinese assaulted a French-held hill , the Frenchmen threw them back with a bayonet charge . <P> In the dark of Thursday morning the Reds almost made it . One Chinese threw a dud grenade into a G.I. 's foxhole , then walloped him with a rifle . The G.I. clubbed the Chinese to death with his Garand . Red engineers blew a hole in the barbed wire with a bangalore torpedo . As Chinese infantry charged in , Sergeant Stewart Oshell 's machine-gunners opened up , and 78 enemy bodies plugged the gap . <P> At dawn , the G.I.s and French counterattacked . Three times ist Lieut . Richard Kotite 's platoon was thrown back from an enemy hill position . Then fighter planes dropped napalm on the Reds . Said Kotite : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thursday afternoon , Colonel Freeman 's perimeter got an iron cavalry rescue . Twenty-two 1st Cavalry Division tanks crashed through from the south , scattered the remnants of the Communist attack . Exhausted G.I.s and poilus climbed out of their foxholes . Around them they counted 1,747 enemy dead . At least 2,000 others had been captured , wounded , or buried by Communist troops in shallow graves on the mountainsides.
