Thoughout a decade of cold war , the non-communist world has been divided on a key question . What is the best way to deal with the Communists ? From a demanding position of strength ? Or from a purely defensive position of conciliation ? Last week , as the West welcomed a rearmed Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization , a clear answer came through the Iron Curtain . In the face of the new display of Western unity and strength , the Communists were reacting almost desperately to Western initiative . <P> The Red reaction took several forms . After ten years of stalling , the Soviet Union finally signed a peace treaty for Austria , agreeing to long-resisted clauses in return for Austrian neutrality . At the same time , with noticeable urgency , the Kremlin arranged a top-level mission to Yugoslavia , a pilgrimage to beg Marshal Tito to take a neutral position . <P> The Communist moves in Austria and Yugoslavia meant a considerable retreat from the old Soviet formula of swallowing up satellites and building an ever-expanding Communist front , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Red army needed only shoes to march to the English Channel . <P> The Time Has Come . " This week came the most important reaction of all : the U.S.S.R. accepted a Western invitation to a Big Four conference of the heads of government some time this summer . The invitation had been issued from Paris , where the NATO Council had met to accept their new colleague , West Germany 's Konrad Adenauer . <P> The timing was all-important . For many months the U.S. had been resisting the idea of a " conference at the summit . " Those months were the critical period when the issue of rearming West Germany hung in the balance . The U.S.S.R. made it menacingly plain that it would do everything it could and dared to prevent German rearmament . The Soviet attitude stirred neutralists and others to support a " conference at the summit " as a substitute for German rearmament . This sentiment was so strong that even Sir Winston Churchill repeatedly urged such a conference , if only to prove that Russian peace talk was insincere . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the conference clamor . <P> More recently , it has been increasingly apparent that Moscow recognizes its failure to divide the West over the German rearmament issue . Secretary of State John Foster Dulles and President Dwight Eisenhower were convinced that last week 's deeds in Europe adequately set the stage for words . Said Dulles : " Our experience has shown that each time we have confronted the Russians with a strong and determined act they have been willing to talk seriously . " <P> The tone of the Western invitation was set largely by John Foster Dulles . " We recognize that the solution of these problems will take time and patience . They will not be solved at a single meeting or in a hasty manner ... In the limited time for which the heads of government could meet , they would not undertake to agree upon substantive answers to the major difficulties facing the world . Such a meeting could , however , provide a new impetus by establishing the basis for the detailed work which will be required . . .
