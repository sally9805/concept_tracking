txt // time of day is noon at the mid-point of the path for the columns headed Day . The night field strength , which is approximately independent of frequency , is given in the column headed Night . The values given are for summer sunspot minimum absorption conditions . In order to show absorption variations , effects of skip at the higher frequencies have been ignored . Day-to-day Variations of Field Strength Besides the regular predictable diurnal , seasonal , and solar-cycle variations of received voltage , there are irregular unpredictable day-today variations . The statistics of these variations and their dependence upon frequency , path length , time of day , and season have been studied by the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory . The data analyzed were hourly median values of received voltage recorded at Washington , D.C. , during the year 1944 from transmissions by a number of stations varying in distance from 590 to 6,580 km and in frequency from 770 to 15,310 kc . The average ratio of the value exceeded on 10 per cent of the days of the month at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90 per cent of days was approximately 4 . The variations of this ratio for different transmission paths , hours of the day , and months of the year were such that in 10 per cent of the cases the ratio was less than 2 and in 10 per cent of the cases greater than 8 . However , the ratio showed no appreciable dependence upon // frequency , distance , or time of day , except in the case of paths approaching the auroral zone for which the ratio was significantly greater than for other paths . The results for frequency and distance variations are not conclusive , because frequency and distance were correlated in the data . Distance Ranges Outside the skip zone the field strength decreases with increasing distance from the transmitter , and at some distance called the " distance range , " the field strength becomes too low for useful communication . This distance depends upon many variables . It depends in part upon the radiated power ; the higher the power , the greater the distance range . But the rate of increase of distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field strength with distance . At night , when the rate of decrease of field strength with distance is small , a given increase in power results in a much greater increase in distance range than during daytime , when the rate of decrease of field strength with distance is great . The distance range also depends upon the minimum required field strength , which is a function of the radio noise level at the receiving station and the type of service ( radio telephone , radio telegraph , etc . ) . As with power , the effect of a change in the required field strength is greater at night than during the day . The rate of decrease of field strength with distance is greater for low frequencies than for high frequencies , especially during the day . Consequently a given change in power , or in required field strength , produces a greater change in distance range at a high frequency than at a low frequency . The distance range is thus a complicated function of the // power and of all the variables which affect field strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of day , season , sunspot number , degree of ionospheric disturbance , orientation and geographical location of the transmission path , and the geographical location of the receiving station . For a given power and required signal-to-noise ratio the variations of distance range may be summarized as follows : 1 . Distance ranges increase with increasing solar zenith angle , being greater at night than during the day , greater in winter than in summer , and greater in high than in low latitudes ( barring paths through the auroral zone and regions affected by ionospheric storms ) . 2 . For transmitting stations located in intermediate latitudes , distance ranges are greater in directions away from the equator than in directions toward the equator . 3 . Distance ranges decrease with increasing sunspot number . 4 . Distance ranges increase with increasing frequency . Limits of Usable Frequencies for Fixed Distances The MUF constitutes the upper limit of the band of frequencies useful for communication over a fixed distance . This limit is practically independent of the power of the transmitting station . The lower limit , or lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the signal-to-noise ratio is less than that tolerable in the type of communication employed . Such a limit usually exists because the field strength of the desired transmission tends to decrease with decreasing frequency while that of atmospheric radio noise tends to increase or at least to decrease less rapidly . The lower limit is a function of the transmitter power , the required bandwidth , and the required signal-to-noise ratio . Specifically , it is a function of the ratio of the power to the // product of the bandwidth and the required signal-to-noise power ratio . It is also a function of the directional pattern of the transmitting antenna and , to the extent that it controls the signal-to-noise ratio , of the directional pattern of the receiving antenna . For a given power , bandwidth , and minimum required signal-to-noise ratio , the LUF varies over a wide range as a function of time of day , season , sunspot number , and geographical location , all of which affect both signal and atmospheric noise levels , and of transmission distance , which also affects the signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than at night , higher in summer than in winter , higher in low latitudes than in high latitudes , higher at sunspot maximum than at sunspot minimum , and , of course , higher at long than at short distances . Fortunately the MUF has similar variations , so that the range of useful frequencies does not fluctuate so much as the extremes . On long east-west paths , the LUF may exceed the MUF at certain times of the day and thus make communication impossible . This is due to the fact that the MUF for the path is the least of the values of MUF for the individual hops along the path , while the LUF depends upon the integrated effect of absorption in all the hops . When the sun rises at the eastern end of the path , absorption and LUF begin to rise , but the MUF does not begin to rise until the sun rises on the westernmost hop . The LUF may exceed the MUF in this period . This situation may occur again near sunset , but the tendency is weaker because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it increases at sunrise . A result of the diurnal , seasonal , and sunspot-cycle variations in MUF and LUF is that in most cases more than one frequency must be provided in order to maintain sky-wave communication between two points at all times throughout the day , year , and sunspot cycle . // Effects of Ionosphere Irregularities Thus far the regular predictable variations of ionosphere and radio-propagation characteristics have been primarily discussed . Certain irregularities or disturbances which have important effects on radio communication will now be described . In middle and equatorial latitudes irregularities are secondary in importance to the regular variations . In the auroral regions , however , where disturbances are frequent and severe , the irregularities are the main features of the ionosphere and of radio propagation . Sporadic E One of the most prevalent of the irregularities , which is not yet well understood , is the sporadic occurrence of a condition in the E layer which reflects waves at frequencies above the normal E-layer MUF . The character and prevalence of this condition vary widely . In low latitudes sporadic E is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during daytime . At higher latitudes it is often more nearly a total reflection and occurs at night as well as during the day . It is especially prevalent and strong in the auroral zone , where its occurrence is correlated with general auroral-zone disturbance . Seasonally , sporadic E is at a maximum in summer . Sporadic E accounts for sky-wave transmission up to higher frequencies than by any other means . Amateurs working in their 50-me band occasionally are able to make contacts over considerable distances ( up to the limit of 1-hop-E ) by sporadic-E reflection . Because of its irregular nature sporadic E usually can not be depended upon for reliable communication . Scattered Reflections Irregularities in the distribution of ionization cause scattered or diffuse reflection of radio waves // in contrast to the mirrorlike reflections obtained when the distribution is smooth . The strongest diffuse reflections known as " spread echoes " occur at F-layer levels , at times even obscuring the normal F-layer reflections . They are mostly observed at night , especially in equatorial regions , and during ionosphere storms . Scattering of much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Scattering may introduce large direction-finding errors . Consider , for example , a sharply beamed transmission aimed obliquely upward . A direction finder located within the skipped zone of the transmitting station would receive waves scattered from the area where the beam intersected the E region , which could be in a direction up to 180 deg from the direction of the transmitting station . Sudden Ionosphere Disturbances Occasionally a sudden outburst of ultraviolet light on the sun , known as a solar flare or chromospheric eruption , produces abnormally high ionization densities in the D region which result in a sudden increase in radio-wave absorption , especially at the lower frequencies . It has negligible effects on the critical frequencies and heights of the reflecting layers , but the reduction of received field strengths may be enormous . This phenomenon is called sudden ionosphere disturbance ( SID ) . " It often results in a complete loss of communications , and its effects may last for several hours in severe cases . Since the SID is produced by direct ultraviolet radiation , it never occurs on the dark side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ varies with the sunspot cycle , being greatest at sunspot maximum . The time of occurrence can not be predicted in individual cases , but it has been found that SID tend to occur in groups on the same day or successive days and to repeat at intervals of one or more solar rotations. // To give an idea of the nuisance value of the SID , the following data on SID observed at Washington , D.C. , 13 are presented . During the sunspot maximum year of 1937 SID were observed on 84 days . On 66 of these the SID was classified as intense , on 39 days there were more than one SID , and on 33 days the SID lasted more than an hour . In the sunspot minimum year 1944 the corresponding numbers were only 5 , 3 , 0 , and 2 . In the sunspot maximum year 1947 they were again high , 121 , 104 , 54 , and 33 . Ionosphere Storms In medium and high latitudes , ionosphere storms are the most troublesome of the ionosphere irregularities . They may occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preference for the equinoxes . They usually last for several days ? several weeks in unusual cases ? and their effects are felt during the night as well as during the daylight hours . They are caused by charged particles from the sun . Such particles are continually bombarding the auroral zones ( regions near the two poles of the earth ) , being guided in along the lines of the earth 's magnetic field . The influx of such particles is irregular . When it increases greatly , the influence extends out from the auroral zones to lower latitudes ; occasionally worldwide ionosphere storms result . Except in the auroral zone itself , which expands during a storm , there is little effect on the E layer and only minor effect on the Fl layer , but the F2 layer is profoundly affected . It is greatly expanded and diffused , resulting in decreased critical frequencies and increased virtual heights . During daylight hours the F2 critical frequency may even drop below the Fl critical frequency ( see Fig. 5 ) . The MUF is , of course , decreased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fading or fluttering signals , and received field strengths are lower ( absorption greater ) than normal . // The following statements summarize the results ( obtained by the Central Radio Propagation Laboratory , unpublished ) of analyzing disturbed conditions resulting from ionosphere storms , for North Atlantic transmission paths , from data furnished by a number of radio users since 1944. 1 . Disturbed days tend to occur on the average in groups of 2 to 3 days . 2 . The percentage of the days of the year which are disturbed varies between 10 and 30. 3 . The percentage of disturbed days does not vary significantly with sunspot number , but the character and distribution of disturbed days do so vary : a . Individual ionosphere storms are of greater intensity at sunspot maximum , but because of the greater range of useful frequencies , communication is not impaired for so long a period as at sunspot minimum . b . After sunspot maximum and extending into the minimum , disturbed days have a pronounced 27-day recurrence tendency and effects on communication are more lasting . Fading The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered in sky-wave propagation in the 2- to 30-me range . Most relatively rapid fading is the result of a combination of interference fading and polarization fading . Both occur even when only one mode of propagation is present , ; h id both increase in rapidity with increasing frequency . Besides the nuisance effects of fading , polarization variat ions may introduce large errors in direction-finder bearings . Special precautions in design and operation must be taken i 11 order to avoid polarization errors . The correlation between fading fluctuations of field // strength received on two adjacent antennas decreases rapidly with increasing separation of the antennas , and the correlation of fading at two adjacent frequencies received on the same antenna decreases rapidly with increasing frequency separation . Fading may therefore be reduced by the use of multiple antennas and frequencies ( " diversity " systems ) . Radio Noise The reader interested in comprehensive information and data on radio noise in this frequency range is referred to the survey published in 1947 by Thomas and Burgess . ' Of the sources of noise listed in Sec. 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 2- to 30-mc range , although extraterrestrial noise may become more important at the higher frequencies at times when the operating frequency is above the MUF for the paths between the receiving station and the atmospheric noise centers . As both atmospheric and extraterrestrial noise are of the random or fluctuation type , their nuisance effect is a function of bandwidth of the receiving set . Below 30 mc radio noise from the sun is nearly always much weaker than galactic noise . The main source of galactic noise appears to be a region near the center of our galaxy in the direction of the Scorpio-Sagittarius region of the celestial sphere . Thus the received intensity at a point on the earth depends upon the position of the zenith in the celestial sphere . The intensity is also affected by ionospheric shielding and absorption . A typical value of required incident field strength for intelligible reception of radio telephony in the presence of galactic noise , using a receiving antenna with no more directivity than a half-wave dipole , is approximately 0.4 ? v per meter between 15 and 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic variations of atmospheric radio noise in the range 2 to 30 me are : 1 . Higher noise levels at low than at high latitudes , the difference being greater during the day than at night , especially at the lower frequencies . 2 . Higher noise levels in the vicinity of land masses than over oceans . 3 . Higher noise levels at night than during the day , especially at the lower frequencies . 4 . Below the MUF limitation , noise levels tend to increase with frequency during the day , decrease with frequency at night . 5 . In temperate latitudes noise levels are higher in summer than in winter . These characteristics are consonant with the origin of atmospheric radio noise in thunderstorms and its propagation to great distances like other radio-frequency fields . A method of estimating the required field strength for reliable radio reception in the presence of atmospheric radio noise is given in Chap . 8 of ref. 5 . Because of limitations of available data on which the method was based , its accuracy is not great , but if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general level and variations of atmospheric radio noise and required field strength . To illustrate the levels and variations numerically , values of required field strength for radiotelephone reception in the presence of atmospheric noise , obtained by the above method , are listed in the following table . The values are given in microvolts per meter at Washington , D.C. // Day-to-day Variations Radio noise levels at a given place , season , and hour of the day vary from day to day . It has been found that the logarithm of the hourly average noise field strength is approximately normally distributed during a month , with a dispersion such that the field strength exceeded on 10 per cent of the days is approximately 2.2 times that exceeded on 50 per cent of the days . Communication Efficiency and Uses of Frequencies in This Range The principal advantage of frequencies in this range is that useful long-distance propagation can be achieved with relatively low transmitter power . When the transmission path is in darkness and the ionosphere is undisturbed , all frequencies below the MUF are propagated to long distances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher frequencies can be used for long-distance communication with low power . Disadvantages of the band are : 1 . Because of the continual variations of the limits of the band of frequencies usable for communication between two points , it is in most cases necessary to have available more than one frequency , often three or four , in order to maintain relatively uninterrupted communication throughout the day , year , and sunspot cycle . This increases the amount of spectrum space required . 2 . A frequency which has a large distance range also has a large interference range . This severely limits the number of transmitting stations over the earth which may use the same frequency simultaneously without creating interference . 3 . Long-distance communication in this frequency range , depending as it does upon ionospheric reflection , is at the mercy of ionospheric disturbances . Particularly in high latitudes near the auroral zone , a certain amount of lost time // during severe ionospheric disturbances is inevitable , and even during moderate disturbances , efficiency may be impaired . In low latitudes the effects of ionospheric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daylight hours cause some lost time . 4 . Even under undisturbed conditions , there are fading and multipath effects which limit efficiency and the speed of intelligence transmission . Fading can be offset to a great extent by the use of diversity systems ( multiple antennas and frequencies ) , but the latter , of course , require additional spectrum space . Multipath distortion can also be lessened somewhat by the use of optimum antenna directivity patterns and a frequency near the MUF . In the case of direction-finding systems , polarization effects , multipath effects , and nongreat-circle propagation are serious problems . In navigational systems , accuracy suffers from changing delay times and the presence of multiple modes of propagation with a wide range of delay times . For such systems operating beyond the ground-wave range , the lower frequencies in the band which are propagated by E-layer reflections are probably best . 2.5 PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SPECTRUM FROM 30 TO 3,000 MC General This very wide band of frequencies is the oldest of the entire radio spectrum ; it was here that Hertz about 1885 produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Marconi , a decade later , conducted his first experiments in " wireless . " Old as this band is , its practical use is fairly recent , for it was little more than a decade ago that it // came into general use . This band is distinguishable from others previously discussed in that it can not in general be relied upon for transmission to great distances . ' There are , however , numerous occasions , particularly at the lower frequencies , when it can be so used . More often , however , longdistance signals of this kind constitute potential sources of interference . Cases of transmission to great distances decrease rapidly with frequency and become negligible at a frequency around 80 mc . At the higher frequencies of this band , atmospheric noise is relatively low . Also these frequencies permit the use of moderately high antenna directivities and the transmission of broad bands of communications . Together , these characteristics tend to make this band very useful , particularly where small or moderate distances are to be covered . It was hoped in the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ionosphere played no very important part in propagation , transmission in this band would be very stable . While this is generally true , there are , as we shall later see , numerous exceptions . The mechanisms which lead to instability are discussed more fully below . Mechanisms of Propagation Substantially all the mechanisms of radio propagation , reflection , refraction , diffraction , and scattering as well as guided propagation play a part in this frequency range . At the lower end of the range , the ionosphere is occasionally sufficiently dense to return waves to earth , particularly at great distances . This band therefore has properties in common with those covered by the two previous sections . Also at the lower frequencies of this band , // ground reflection is particularly important . It will be remembered that , for certain antenna heights , the ground-reflected wave tends to cancel the direct wave , while for others there is reinforcement , so that some antenna heights result in more efficient transmission than others . It was pointed out in Sec. 2.1 that , on the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its dielectric constant decrease with height above earth , with the practical result that radio waves in this frequency range tend to follow the curvature of the earth . The radius of curvature turns out to be about four times the earth 's curvature . For this case the relative curvature is 1 ? = ? . Facts are correctly represented if we assume rectilinear propagation over an earth whose radius is four-thirds of the earth 's actual radius . This effect tends to make the range of a transmitter slightly greater than the horizon distance . The atmosphere that has this distribution of dielectric constant is called a " standard atmosphere " and the gradient is called a " standard gradient . " It is of interest that the properties of the earth 's atmosphere do not always vary smoothly with altitude . As a result of an unequal heating or possibly to a failure of the air to , nix freely , discrete layers are often formed with more or less definite interfaces between . If the change in properties in the interface is sufficiently rapid , the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there may be threedimensional air masses having somewhat different dielectric constants from the surrounding air . There is evidence , too , that , on occasion , the dielectric constant of the air near the earth may be less rather than greater than that directly above . This effect is known as an inversion . Deviations of the kind just referred to account for certain vagaries of propagation discussed in this and also in the succeeding section . One interesting example is the phenome94 RADIO SPECTRUM CONSERVATION non of guided propagation , which may occur when the rate of change of index of refraction in an inversion is so great that waves are bent repeatedly back to earth for successive earth reflections . Radio waves may be propagated to great distances by this mechanism . This phenomenon will be discussed more at length later . Deviation from standard gradient of the index of refraction does not always improve radio-wave propagation . For example , an abrupt change in the gradient can bend the waves in such a way that there are regions to which very little energy is propagated . Specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes through this change in the gradient , there may be a reduction in the received field strength by as much as a factor of 10 ( 20 db ) . Another type of deviation important in this frequency range is the irregular , though small , variation due to atmospheric turbulence . These fluctuations in the dielectric constant of the atmosphere are a cause of fading of the radio signal . Irregularities in the atmosphere may also scatter the wave . Sometimes small but nevertheless measurable scattering is observable at distances far beyond that at which any signal could otherwise be received . The mechanism of diffraction plays its major role in this frequency range . At the lower frequencies ( longer wavelengths ) the bending of the waves into the shadow region of the obstacle ( the earth ) is sufficiently complete that a good approximation is to assume the earth 's surface plane . At the higher frequencies ( shorter wavelengths ) the effect of diffraction is very much less , so that the bending of the waves into the shadow of the obstacle ( the earth ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this mechanism is relatively unimportant . In this frequency range , however , neither of these two extremes forms a good approximation to the actual propagation conditions , and the // amount of bending resulting from diffraction must be determined by more exact means . Some of the polarization effects prevalent at the lower frequencies are also present in the frequency range under consideration . The reflection coefficient of the ground ( and objects in the propagation path ) is greater for the component wave having its electric vector parallel to the reflecting surface than for the component having its electric vector perpendicular thereto . The angular distribution of energy scattered by atmospheric turbulence also depends upon the polarization , since the scatterer may be visualized as a dipole oscillating parallel to the electric vector of the incident wave whose reradiation has the directional characteristics of this dipole . As throughout the frequency spectrum , so in this frequency range , there are phenomena which contribute to the distortion of the signal . Atmospheric turbulence is continually contributing to short-time variations of the signal amplitude . Also multiple-path transmission may produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other parts . This results in the transmitting medium not only attenuating the signal and introducing a background noise but also distorting the desired signal . When it is desired to transmit the maximum amount of information in any given frequency band in a specified time , this distortion may be an even more important limitation than the signal-to-noise ratio . Certain of these phenomena will be discussed further below . Ground-wave Propagation In this frequency range , it is common experience to find that the power radiated from an elevated antenna varies over a smooth terrain inversely as the square of the distance . The distances at which this applies depend on the frequency and // antenna heights . At greater distances the rate of decrease rapidly becomes exponential . Well within the horizon , the interference between the direct and ground-reflected wave produces a series of maxima and minima . The field strengths in these regions are complicated functions of the conductivity and dielectric constant of the earth . Also actual terrain varies markedly from that assumed above . Thus the application of the science of propagation in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is rather complicated . Attempts to calculate the field strength prevailing at a distance from a transmitter have met with varying degrees of success . All involve simplifications which at best are only approximated in practice . In one simplification the earth 's surface is assumed to be a perfectly homogeneous sphere surrounded by a homogeneous atmosphere . Even this is complicated mathematically . It resisted attack for a period of a decade or so , until Watson ' in 1919 took an important simplifying step by expressing the solutions as a rapidly converging exponential series . Later investigators introduced the effect of different electrical properties of the ground and the effect of the uniform decrease in the dielectric constant of the atmosphere with height . ' A better understanding of this very difficult problem may be had by considering a series of idealizations of increasing theoretical complexity . The simplest idealization is that of propagation between two vertical antennas above a perfectly conducting plane . ' The effect of the plane is to introduce a reflected wave in addition to the direct wave . This reflected wave is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transmitter , so that , for antennas in contact with the plane , the received field strength is exactly twice that from an antenna carrying the same current located in free space . As a result of the reaction between the image of the antenna and the antenna itself , its impedance is changed , so that the power // transfer between two vertical antennas above a perfectly conducting plane is the same as that in free space . At sufficient distances it is possible to raise the antenna height while at the same time obtaining the benefit of the image of the ground as far as received field strength is concerned , so that the received power for vertical antennas whose height above the ground is large compared with the wavelength and whose distance apart is large compared with the antenna height is four times that for the same antenna in free space . The path difference between the direct and reflected waves may become of the order of a wavelength or more , in which case the interference pattern between the direct and reflected wave already referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider the perfect reflecting plane to be replaced by one which has the same electrical properties as the actual ground . ' When this is done , the field strength is still inversely proportional to the distance for short distances but becomes inversely proportional to the square of the distance for larger distances . The transition between these two relationships occurs at a distance which is equal to the complex dielectric constant of the ground times the wavelength divided by 2r for vertical polarization . For horizontal polarization the inverse square relationship starts in the immediate vicinity of the antenna . Some of the relationships described in this and the preceding paragraph are shown graphically in Fig. 7 below . The next complexity to be added to the approximation to actual propagation conditions is to take into consideration the curvature of the earth . The shadow factor , which represents the quantity by which the field for propagation over an imperfectly conducting plane must be multiplied to obtain the field for propagation over a sphere , is a function of the distance , frequency , radius of the earth , ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effect // of the earth 's curvature is negligible . At greater distances the field drops off exponentially . For a more precise statement see The Effect of the Earth 's Curvature on Groundwave Propagation by Burrows and Gray . ' The results of the above analysis are further summarized in the following sec=tions . If as a final complexity we introduce the effect of hills and other intervening objects , the problem becomes very complicated indeed . Irregular terrain , with no pronounced hills , may be approximated by fitting an average sphere to the actual terrain . ' If there is a single intervening hill , an approximation may be had by assuming that the received wave is made up of several components , each accounted for by // particular features of the terrain . ' Other approximations have been formulated , ' each quite useful in establishing magnitudes of expected results but hardly applicable to specific problems . In view of this situation the practical engineer confronted with a special problem will probably feel that it is better to exercise good engineering judgment followed by an experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ratio of the power received by an antenna , Pr , to that transmitted by a similar antenna , Pt , is a significant quantity called the " radio gain . " 7 It is a measure of the communication efficiency . For two doublets located in free space ( this is called the free space gain ) : where a , is wavelength and d is distance , both measured in the same units . This indicates that , for transmission in free space with nondirective antennas , the gain is inversely proportional to the square of the distance measured in wavelengths . The above relationship applies specifically to nondirective doublets . For directive antennas having an effective area A , Eq . ( 1 ) becomes As mentioned earlier , the formulas also apply to the paths between vertical antennas above a perfectly conducting plane . If the conductivity of the plane is not perfect , however , the inverse square of distance relationship merges into an inverse fourth-power distance relationship . This occurs at a distance which depends upon the ground constants . // Returning to doublet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function only of the transmission path , frequency and polarization and accordingly is called path gain . For antennas raised above a certain height which also depends upon the ground constants , there is a range of heights It and distances d for which the path gain is given by the following equation : This indicates that , in this range , the communication efficiency varies inversely as the fourth power of the ratio of height to the distance and is independent of frequency . Figure 7 illustrates how these and other relationships calculated by the above-mentioned theory apply to propagation for one representative set of conditions . It illustrates the inverse square of distance relationship , Eq . ( 1 ) , which holds for short distances . This is followed at a somewhat greater distance by the interference fringes that result from the interaction between the direct wave and that reflected from the ground within the line of sight . Further on there is the inverse fourth-power relationship , while at the extreme right there is the effect of the earth 's curvature . Equation ( 2 ) indicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication efficiency in free space increases with the frequency ( inversely with the wavelength ) for antennas of equal size . The advantage of the higher frequencies is increased still further when the effect of reflection from the earth 's surface is taken into consideration . This suggests that , in order to take full advantage of these relationships , services requiring omnidirectional antennas such as broadcasting should be assigned frequencies near the lower end of this range , while services permitting the exploitation of highly directive antennas such as point-to-(3) // point communication should be assigned the higher fre quencies in the range . Modifying Effects The above summarizations assume average transmission conditions . As already pointed out , there are various meteorological effects which may materially modify these conditions . A few that are of special importance are noted below . Air Masses There is a form of fading which frequently occurs in this frequency range that can best be explained by assuming that the received signal arrives by two or more paths , as , for example , by ground reflection , and that the effective lengths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to two or more components of the received signal , each varying in phase to produce at the receiver a resultant signal of variable amplitude . This type of fading can be caused by air masses of slightly different dielectric constant from the surrounding air passing through one or another of the several paths . Air masses of this kind are well known in meteorology . Fading of this type may be very rapid , but more often the variations may extend over several minutes or even hours . It can be mitigated by the use of automatic gain control at the receiver and corresponding increases of power at the transmitter . Effects of Elevated Layers Besides the inversion layer that may on occasion be found near the earth to trap waves and propagate them to great distances , there may be elevated layers of air having dielectric constants appreciably different from the layers immediately above or below . The interfaces between these layers may provide a sufficient discontinuity to reflect radio waves in this frequency range . Under certain // conditions an abrupt change in the vertical gradient of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrease in the received field strength over an appreciable range of distances . This has been observed in the propagation between aircraft under such conditions that the direct path between the two craft barely penetrates the layer of the increased negative vertical dielectric constant gradient . Under these conditions there is a range of distances for which , on the basis of geometrical optics , no rays penetrate . This effect has been observed throughout the frequency range covered in this section . Turbulence 8 Even a " well-mixed " atmosphere may not be entirely homogeneous . The very turbulence that produces the mixing provides deviations in the dielectric constant from the mean . The scale of these deviations is of the same order of magnitude as the turbulent eddies . Radio waves are scattered by the deviations from the mean of the dielectric constant which result from this turbulence . While the amount of energy scattered by a unit volume of the atmosphere is negligibly small , the total integrated effect produces a signal which predominates over the weak signal that would be diffracted around the earth 's curvature under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of atmospheric scattering in the troposphere , the field that would cause interference with other services operating on the same frequency is not the field of the standard propagation but is greater than this as a result of atmospheric scattering . This scattered field comes from a direction somewhat above horizontal . Ionospheric Scattering The scattering theory of Booker and Gordon 8 has been extended to the ionosphere by Booker. ? His theory predicts long-range ionospheric communication at VHF up to ranges of 1,200 miles . ExperiPROPAGATION // ments 10 have confirmed the existence of such propagation at 50 me per sec at a range of 780 miles . Signals are always present and increase during sudden ionospheric disturbances . Atmospheric Ducts ? Guided Propagation As already pointed out , special meteorological conditions may lead to a steep gradient in the dielectric constant gradient at points near the earth . This gradient may on occasion be so steep that the wave is repeatedly bent back to earth for a succession of reflections . This results in a small but very significant portion of the wave being trapped in a thin layer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively little attenuation . The phenomenon is not unlike that of waveguide transmission , particularly the form in which waves are propagated through a dielectric slab . Since in this case the earth provides one of the two guiding discontinuities and ground scattering may be appreciable at the higher frequencies , we may expect guided propagation to be more prevalent at 200 than at 10,000 mc . This appears to be the case . One rather interesting example of duct propagation was noted during World War II , when a radar station at Bombay , India , observed reflections from the coast of Arabia 3,000 km ( 1,800 miles ) away . Although at this location duct effects were noted so frequently as to be almost consistent , there are many stations at which the phenomenon is almost unknown . Duct propagation has been observed at various times and places over a wide range of frequencies , even to frequencies of 10,000 mc . In general , however , it is so rare that it is not relied upon as a practicable medium of propagation . Conditions favorable for duct transmission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth caused by a decrease in air temperature or an increase in moisture content , // or both . This may occur , for example , when cool air blows over a warm sea as in a trade-wind belt . It may be caused also on clear quiet nights when the surface of the earth and nearby layers of air are chilled by radiation . Still another mechanism is subsidence inversion . This may occur where dry air for extreme heights merely settles to lower levels without acquiring heat in the process . Subsidence inversion is usually associated with areas of high atmospheric pressure . Radio Noise As in other portions of the radio spectrum , so in this band , noise plays an important role . The various components of noise , including atmospheric , ignition , resistance , and extraterrestrial sources , are discussed below . Atmospheric Noise The atmospheric noise at any location is the integrated effect of thunderstorms throughout the world . The radiation from these natural transmitters is subject to the same laws of propagation as affect the desired signal . Since in this frequency band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect atmospheric noise to be generally low . This is the case . Such atmospheric noise as prevails is usually due to local thunderstorms and appears generally as sharp clicks . In general , atmospheric noise decreases with increasing frequency , becoming negligible at the HF end of the band . Industrial Noise When currents flowing in ordinary circuits are interrupted , transients are set up . If conditions are favorable , as in ignition systems , power will be radiated as noise to become a potential source of interference . Other sources of such noise result from the turning on and off of motors and lights and from diathermy machines , X-ray equipment , // and electronic equipment . Since ignition systems have resonances in the frequency range covered by this section , they may be expected to constitute one of the more important sources . This is particularly important , since mobile services such as those used on aircraft and automobiles are accommodated in this band . Their effects are usually minimized either by altering the steepness of the transient or by a suitable shielding . Most industrial noises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order of 3,000 inc . Receiver Noise In addition to the sources of noise just mentioned there are certain kinds of noise that arise within the receiver itself . One form , sometimes referred to as resistance or Johnson noise , arises in the early circuits of the receiver and is subject to any amplification that follows . This type of noise may be reduced by a suitable reduction of temperature , but it follows a law that makes cooling generally impracticable . This type of noise appears to set a limit of received power below which we may never pass . A second source of noise may arise in the first detector or first amplifier of a receiving system . In this band of frequencies this type of noise is somewhat greater than the corresponding thermal noise just referred to . Already considerable improvement has been made in its reduction , and further progress may be expected . Extraterrestrial Radio Waves A third type of noise , particularly important at frequencies below 300 mc , is due to radio waves coming from the galaxy outside the solar system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sagittarius in the Milky Way . It is sometimes referred to as galactic noise . Certain measurements made with horizontal half-wave antennas located a quarter wave above the ground have // shown that galactic noise is about 20 times that of the thermal noise in the receiver . Directive antennas may be used to discriminate against this type of noise , except , of course , under particular circumstances when the Milky Way lies in the path of transmission . The sun emits radio waves as well as light waves . This type of noise is greater at frequencies of a few hundred megacycles than at higher frequencies and is much greater at times of sunspots than during quiescent periods . Its magnitude when received over moderately directive antennas pointed at the sun is somewhat greater than the noise prevailing in the receiver . Like galactic waves , solar waves can ordinarily be discriminated against by the use of directive antennas . Utility of the Frequency Range 30 to 3,000 me At the lower edge of this frequency range reliable longdistance propagation appears possible by the mechanism of scattering from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers and antenna gains are employed . Since the number of long-distance communication channels could conceivably be increased a hundredfold thereby , it appears that this is the most important use to which these frequencies could be assigned . The lower frequencies in this band are also useful for transmission well beyond the horizon . This together with the fact that moderately high powers may be produced and wide bands of frequencies may be accommodated makes this range applicable to a number of possible local uses . Included are visual broadcasting and communication with mobile objects such as motor vehicles and airplanes . Also this region has important radar applications . As we proceed toward the higher frequencies , primary // power becomes more difficult to produce , diffraction effects are less pronounced , and receiver noise becomes appreciable , but these limitations are largely offset by low atmospheric noise and the possibility of obtaining greater directive gains . Also still wider bands of frequencies may be accommodated . The need to offset low power with high directive gain suggests the use of these higher frequencies for point-topoint services rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band , high-definition radar becomes quite feasible . 2.6 PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SPECTRUM FROM 3,000 TO 300,000 MC General This very wide band of frequencies is the newest to find practical use and also the newest to be explored as regards physical features . Indeed , it is so new that large portions are still uncharted . In contrast to lower-frequency bands , we find in this region little or no evidence that the ionosphere plays any important part in propagation . This leaves as the principal means of communication the directly radiated wave . Diffraction effects , which at the lower frequencies play such an important part in bending waves around obstacles and over horizons to serve areas beyond , are still present , but they are becoming progressively less important . Thus more than ever these higher frequencies are limited in their primary service range . Also , in contrast , we find in this new range , particularly near its upper limits , a very special feature which , though not exactly new , is of particular importance . It is the tendency for molecular aggregations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attenuate severely the transmitted signal . It is of interest , too , that atmospheric radio noise , the principal source of noise below about 30 mc , is almost completely absent . Also extraterrestrial noise is so small as to be of little practical consequence . Ordinarily this low noise level would permit communication with extremely low powers were it not that the type of noise arising in the early circuits of radio receivers now predominates and prevents the complete realization of this very desirable situation . This particular aspect of the noise problem is currently being given a great deal of attention . Special Techniques An important feature of this frequency band , quite unrelated to the transmission characteristics of the radio medium , is a relatively new circuit technique that makes it possible to carry out efficiently , in this upper register of frequencies , processes that were previously feasible only at much lower frequencies . More particularly it is possible to utilize new modulation , filtering , and amplifying techniques and to assemble as a closely packed radio band either several television channels or virtually hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antenna structure . This new circuit technique has been used very effectively in communications work at frequencies up to 7,500 me ( 2. = 4 cm ) and in radar to frequencies of 10,000 mc ( 2. = 3 cm ) or more . Beyond about 30,000 mc ( ) . = 1 cm ) apparatus difficulties of one kind or another become increasingly serious . This , at the moment , is one of the more interesting frontiers of radio science . An important feature of this new technique is a more effective means for producing sharply directed beams . The latter appears to be increasingly more feasible as frequency is increased . As already explained , the use of sharp beams // tends to conserve power that might otherwise be wasted on areas in which no service is needed . At these high frequencies the gain is such as to enable a few watts of directed power to be as effective at the distant receiver as many kilowatts of undirected power . A similar gain may be obtained from the use of a directive antenna at the receiver . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portion most thoroughly explored , combined power gains , both at the transmitter and at the receiver , of a hundred million ( 80 db ) or more are not uncommon . At the high-frequency end , it should be possible to provide very much higher gains . As might be expected , the use of highly directive systems tends to avoid interference with other stations operating in the same or neighboring channels . It will be readily apparent that high radio directivities have their greatest application in the point-to-point services and that their value in the forms of broadcasting now in general use is distinctly limited . Considerations of Power The substantial power enhancements that accrue from the use of high directivity come as a fortunate compensation for other difficulties inherent at these frequencies . As already mentioned , noise arising in the radio receiver is a limiting factor . While there is some prospect that this may be reduced with further improvement , there is also in prospect a limit , apparently set by nature and known as resistance noise or theoretical first-circuit noise , below which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it progressively more difficult to maintain the necessary signal-to-noise ratios to ensure a good grade of service . For frequencies in the lower part of this band , the upper level of sustained power now in current use in communications services lies between 5 and 20 watts . Often it is but a fraction of a watt . At the highest frequen110 RADIO SPECTRUM CONSERVATION Gies of the band , no adequate methods of producing and using wave power have been developed . Hence no limiting power level can be specified . It is reasonable to expect that with further improvements in techniques both the frequency frontier and the presently available power levels will be substantially increased . One promising method of increasing the effective power and also of extending the frequency frontier consists of concentrating the available energy in short pulses each a fraction of a microsecond long spaced by relatively long periods each of perhaps thousands of microseconds . Methods of this kind are currently used in radar to produce peak powers of thousands of kilowatts , and considerable thought is being given to ways by which they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a given antenna structure is directly proportional to each of its dimensions measured in wavelengths . In the case of the paraboloid , which is one favored form of antenna , it is therefore possible to obtain from a given structure a hundred times as much directive gain from the use of 30,000-me waves as from the use of 3,000-me waves . By the same token we find that , as we proceed toward the higher frequencies , the necessary radio antenna for a given degree of directivity becomes progressively smaller and accordingly it may be made more readily portable . The combination of portability with beam sharpness has made this band very useful for radar as , well as for communications . As applied to radar , the sharp beam makes it possible to resolve and note on a viewing screen details that otherwise might be lost . The degree of resolution increases with beam sharpness and hence with frequency . Thus there is a particular urge in radar to make higher and higher frequencies available . At the highest frequencies used in radar // it is already possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivers , islands , and bays but a considerable amount of fine detail as well . Physical Properties of the Medium This band of frequencies ( 3,000 to 300,000 me ) like that discussed in Sec. 2.5 , is propagated mainly by the troposphere . The latter consists roughly of four-fifths nitrogen and onefifth oxygen together with a sprinkling of argon , carbon dioxide , water vapor , and smoke particles . Also of appreciable importance in reflecting waves are insects , birds , and other air-borne objects . On rainy or foggy days there may be in addition substantial quantities of water particles of varying dimensions . Most of these substances play a part in one way or another in radio propagation . Meteorological Effects It has been pointed out that , on the average , the density of the earth 's atmosphere and its index of refraction decrease with height , with the practical result that radio waves tend to follow the curvature of the earth . This effect makes the range of a transmitter slightly greater than the horizon distance . It was pointed out also that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothly with elevation . As a result of uneven heating or possibly of a failure of the air to mix freely , discrete layers are often formed with more or less definite interfaces between . These interfaces are believed to play a very important part in the fading phenomena observed in this band as well as in the band previously discussed . Also there are times and places , too , where the density and hence the index of refraction of air close to the earth may , temporarily at least , be less , rather than greater , than that directly above . These unusual effects , known as inversions , may conspire with a // smooth earth below or another layer above to form a kind of guide for propagating waves from one point to another . These peculiar guiding effects , which are referred to as ducts , were a feature of the discussion of the previous band . They are prevalent also in this band . Ground Reflections As at frequencies below 3,000 mc , so in those above , the earth and the various objects thereon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , however , that the earth 's role in the two bands is rather different . In the range below 3,000 me there may be a direct component between transmitter and receiver which follows the line of sight , and there may be one or more components that have left the transmitter slightly off beam and have been reflected by the earth at some intervening point . It was explained that , if , in this low-frequency case , the heights of the two antennas are properly proportioned relative to their separation and the earth is a good reflector , the second component may be of considerable amplitude and may arrive in such phase as to reinforce the first . If the heights are inappropriate , the two components will , of course , oppose and the corresponding signal level may be very low . In the frequency range above 3,000 mc , it seldom happens that the earth is perfectly smooth but instead it appears , roughly at least , as though it were made up of an infinite number of very small mirrors , each a fairly good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a diffuse reflection of incident radio waves . If in addition the earth is covered with vegetation , much of the incident radiation will be absorbed . Together , these two effects tend to make specular reflection a rare phenomenon . Thus very little reflected power reaches the distant receiver . It is evident that , in cases where the reflected component reaching the receiver is small , there can be no very strong signal due to reinforcePROPAGATION // meat and no very weak signal due to wave interference . This condition is as though we had free-space transmission . In cases of this kind , antenna height is relatively unimportant as long as there is an adequate line in sight . In so far as the inherent roughness of the earth and objects thereon tend to avoid multiple-path transmission and therefore fading , roughness is a virtue . Scattering is of further value in the case of radar . Because of this roughness , there is usually , on an object under observation , a sufficient number of reflecting facets facing the radar to return the necessary wave power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , its returned wave power becomes progressively less important , and at that time elevated objects on the horizon become the principal reflectors . At these frequencies not only do tall buildings become discernible but so also do small objects , particularly when they may be contrasted to a non-reflecting background . Good examples are buoys and similar small objects floating on water . Layer Reflections Though the roughness of the earth tends to reduce the particular kind of multiple-path transmission and fading associated with earth reflection , another very important type of fading remains . It is believed to be associated with multiple paths supported by discrete layers in the earth 's atmosphere . If the length of any component path supported by these Iayers changes , there will be a shift in the interference pattern at the receiver and accordingly there will be fading . This type of fading , which was discussed more at length in the previous section , is believed to he particularly important in this frequency region . Diffraction Effects Another very important characteristic of radio waves is diffraction . It relates to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill the space be114 RADIO SPECTRUM CONSERVATION hind . In general , diffraction becomes progressively less important as the frequency is increased , with the result that in the present range there is a tendency , more pronounced than ever , for buildings and man-made objects to cast sharp shadows . Likewise , smooth buildings tend to produce sharp reflections . It is of interest that , though the tall buildings of large urban areas tend to shield their streets from microwave signals , multiple reflections from their surfaces tend to offset this effect and give rise in the street to stronger signals than otherwise might be expected . In these cases , wave power seems to follow the direction of the street . Rain Scattering At frequencies of several thousand megacycles , rain has a deleterious effect on radio propagation . This effect depends on the size of the individual drops as well as on the total number of drops encountered . It is of interest that , although pure water is transparent to visible light , it is rather opaque to radio waves , particularly in this upperfrequency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very much greater than that of air . Hence the wavelength in water is correspondingly shorter . Since at these very high frequencies the wavelength is already short , this further reduction is such as to make the wavelength inside the drop comparable to the drop diameter . This leads to a kind of resonance which makes raindrops virtual traps for passing wave power . Experiments suggest that not all of this trapped energy is converted into heat . A very substantial portion is reradiated from the raindrop as a new center . It is significant that , though the exciting wave power may have arrived along a highly directed beam , it is reradiated in a wide range of directions . This phenomenon , known as scattering , is quite analogous to scattering in ordinary optics , the theory of which was worked out by Lord Rayleigh about fifty years ago to explain the blueness of the sky . This type of // scattering has an attenuating effect on radio waves that is somewhat like that of diffuse earth reflections . Though absorption and scattering are fundamentally quite different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal are much the same . If the drop size is small compared with the wavelength , as might be the case with fog and relatively low frequencies , the loss is dependent only on the mass of water in suspension and accordingly is small . Molecular Absorption Water drops are not the only centers that may absorb or attenuate radio waves . The molecules both of water vapor and of oxygen may also produce this effect . ' The latter , however , occur at much higher frequencies . In the case of water vapor , absorption occurs around the frequency 22,300 me ( a , = 1.34 cm ) . The rate of attenuation depends on the amount of water vapor present and is such as to make the loss at this particular frequency rather serious in humid regions of the tropics . In this case the signal might be attenuated to one-half its initial value in traveling distances as small as 6 km ( 3.7 miles ) . For average conditions prevailing at sea , the corresponding distance is estimated to be as small at 16 kin ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas in North America , these attenuations would probably be less . The attenuation in desert regions for this type of attenuation would presumably be very small . Absorption due to oxygen molecules appears to be of greatest importance at frequencies of about 60,000 me = 5 mm ) . Indirect measurements suggest that at this frequency the attenuation may be such that the initial signal // power is reduced to one-half in traveling as little as 200 meters ( 220 yd ) . Theory indicates that there are other oxygen-absorption bands at still higher frequencies . The intervening regions are referred to as " windows . " One absorption band that is believed to be even more deleterious than that just mentioned is calculated to appear at about 120,000 me ( 2. = 2.5 mm ) . It is to be noted in passing that the various losses just referred to fall into three rather different categories . For example , the importance of raindrops depends to a large extent on the frequency at which rains are encountered . Storms that may affect the lower frequencies are relatively rare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The importance of water vapor is similar , but since in most practical cases there is always a considerable amount of moisture in the atmosphere , these losses are somewhat harder to avoid . In contrast , the radio losses due to oxygen molecules are altogether unavoidable except possibly by a proper choice of frequencies . No losses due to nitrogen molecules have so far been cited . Theory indicates that they would not be serious , at least in the band of frequencies with which we are here concerned . Scattering by raindrops and by molecules of water vapor and oxygen is presumably not unlike that described in Sec. 2.5 and there ascribed to discrete air masses in the atmosphere . It is of interest that scattering phenomena described there extend into this frequency band . Transmission Characteristics of a Typical Radio Path 1-laving discussed briefly the physical properties of the medium by which communication takes place , we shall examine more fully how these properties may affect in practice the over-all characteristics of the path . // Variation with Distance On the average , the power received from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square of the distance . Thus , doubling the distance between the transmitter and receiver reduces the received power by a factor of 4 . Accordingly the received field strength is reduced by a factor of 2 . This relationship holds generally for all short distances , but at a range which corresponds roughly to the distance to the horizon , a new and more complicated relationship sets in . Beyond the horizon the signal decreases with distance very rapidly , and soon its level becomes too low for general use . As might be expected , the rate at which the signal power decreases in this fringe zone is a complicated function of terrain . Hence it is seldom possible to forecast in any detail its transmission behavior . It is generally true , however , that the signal level in this fringe zone falls off more rapidly for the higher frequencies than for the lower frequencies . Thus these higher frequencies are more than ever distinctly local both in their effect in producing a usable signal and in their effect in creating interference with other channels . In an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any natural elevations that may be present . This range is further augmented by the erection of suitable towers . As long as we stay well within the horizon distance and the characteristics of the medium remain constant , only a fraction of a watt of transmitted power is needed . Modifying Effects In a properly aligned radio system , it is common experience to find that the signal level remains substantially constant for many weeks , but on occasion , it may vary through very wide limits and accordingly may produce considerable trouble . Often these variations take place during nighttime hours in summer and at times when there are few , if anv , air currents . In a few cases where the // phenomena have been examined rather carefully , it is found that not only does the level of the received signal vary but so also does its angle of arrival . Indeed , the signal may on rare occasions arrive from angles outside the region of maximum response of the receiving antenna . Thus it is possible for receiving antennas to be too sharp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Usually the main component arrives from angles above the line of sight , but on a few occasions it has been observed arriving from angles below . Available data strongly suggest that , in some cases at least , the received signal is a composite not only of two components , as already explained , but of numerous components , each of which has arrived by paths of different lengths and different angles to produce interference in the receiver . Pathlength differences as great as 7 ft have been reported . These correspond to simultaneous fading at frequency intervals in the transmitted band as small as 150 me . This phenomenon is referred to as selective fading . Angular differences of a few tenths of a degree are common . ' Components arriving from angles below the line of sight suggest that the upper portions of the wave front have traveled more slowly than the lower portions and that , in the medium between , the more highly refractive ( more dense ) layers of air are temporarily located above less dense layers . These are presumably substantially the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will not be discussed further here . A matter of great practical interest is the prevalence of these fading phenomena . Though this band is a new field of study and though the phenomena in question are relatively infrequent in their occurrence , sufficient data have already been accumulated to warrant important conclusions . On one particular path of about 25.5 miles mostly overland in northern Ohio on which the operating frequency was roughly // 1,000 me ( 2 = 7.5 cm ) , it was found that during the month of July , 1948 , the signal power was at least one-half its calculated free-space value 72 per cent of the time . It was greater than one-tenth its free-space value nearly 98 per cent of the time and greater than one-one-hundredth this value about 99.7 per cent of the time . On systems of this kind single fades to one-one-thousandth ( 30 db ) of their original power level are not regarded as serious . The troublesome periods centered around the early morning hours , but fading occasionally took place as early as 10 P.M. and as late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was slightly more severe , but thereafter fading conditions improved until the end of the year , when measurements were discontinued . During the month of December the signal power was on the average at least one-half its calculated free-space value more than 96 per cent of the time , more than one-fourth the freespace value 99.6 per cent of the time , and greater than onetenth the free-space value practically all the time . Somewhat similar data have been obtained on other paths in eastern United States . In contrast to the above cases , which may be regarded as representative , it was found that , , on a particular 29-mile path extending across a deep valley in an arid section of the West in which strong air currents prevailed , there was little or no fading . In another path , this time in California , fading was observed in daytime and also in winter . In still another eery unusual and very interesting case , the path extended across a salt flat in western Utah . This path was unusual in that it combined typical desert climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flatness . It was one of the very few cases in this frequency range in which it was found that specular ground reflection prevailed . It was found that , when antennas 135 ft high were used , fading was serious . Most of the fading difficulties were reduced to ac120 RADIO SPECTRUM CONSERVATION ceptable levels by making use of fortunately located elevations in such a way that successive repeater points were alternately high and low . This arrangement made it possible to operate on the first Fresnel maximum under conditions in which the effects of change of path length were a minimum . It is believed that , on most paths encountered in practice , the signal will be greater than one-tenth its free-space value 90 per cent of the time even during the worst months . Other observations made by Bell System engineers between 1943 and 1946 on a range of five frequencies between 710 and 24,000 mc indicate quite clearly that over this range difficulties from fading generally increase with frequency . This has been substantiated by measurements made by the Western Union Telegraph Company 0 at frequencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4,200 mc ( 2 = 7.1 cm ) , 6,400 mc ( X 4.7 cm ) , and 9,700 mc = 3.6 cm ) . There is relatively little information about radio links similar to the above but operating at still higher frequencies . However , it is to be expected from known properties of the atmosphere that such fading will prevail throughout the entire band . Rain Scattering Beginning as early as 1935 , experiments were performed z to determine the impairment to a radio path resulting from scattering or absorption by raindrops . This was done at a frequency of 3,300 Inc . No impairment was noted . Seven years later other tests were made at frequencies of about 10,000 and 30,000 mc Still later similar tests were made at about 50,000 me . ' These measurements have since been adequately verified.10 They indicate that , with the better techniques now available , communications systems operating at frequencies of 10,000 mc ( X = 3 cm ) are only // slightly affected by rains of cloudburst proportions . At frequencies of 30,000 mc ( X = 1 cm ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may now be rather serious , while rains of average proportions now become appreciable . j At 50,000 mc ( = 6 mm ) it is quite evident that even rains of average proportions will be rather serious . It is generally agreed that , since radar signals must pass through a rainstorm both before and after reflection from the distant target , radar is somewhat more vulnerable to rain than ordinary communications . In addition to contributing attenuation , rain may envelop the distant target and impair definition . A mathematical theory of rain scattering 71 which these experiments seem to support indicates that losses due to rain increase with frequency throughout this band . No attenuation attributable to snow has so far been reported . It seems doubtful that this form of attenuation will be of importance in this band of frequencies as long as the snow remains dry . Losses due to rain scattering , like those due to fading , are of importance only if they occur frequently . Strangely enough , data on the frequency of rains of varying proportions , applicable to different parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as are available indicate that rains of cloudburst proportions are relatively rare , while those which might be characterized as merely average are much less frequent than might be supposed . Conclusions based somewhat on general judgment and sense of proportion indicate that , for radio relay systems , transmission frequencies of about 10,000 mc would not be seriously hampered by rain * but , at some rather indefinite // point above this frequency , troubles may be expected . Eastwest systems seem particularly vulnerable in North America , since they lie along the path of heavy showers . In single-link radio communication systems where the path is relatively short or where reliability is less important , these higher frequencies may prove to be very useful . Also in radar systems where some reliability may be sacrificed for high definition , these higher frequencies may likewise be justified . These practical limits are by their nature rather indefinite . Radio Noise In the portions of this band that have so far been examined , both atmospheric noise and galactic noise are almost unknown . Moreover , solar noise is at such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directional methods that it , too , can usually be neglected . This leaves the noise arising in the radio receiver as the principal limitation to the use of extremely low powers . Receiver noise consists of two distinct components . One is the noise that arises in the conductors forming the various circuit elements . The other arises in active electronic devices such as crystal detectors and amplifier tubes . The power in the first type of noise is a function both of the resistance of the early circuits of the receiver and of the bandwidth to which the receiver is adjusted . It is also a simple function of the temperature of the receiver , measured in degrees absolute . In this frequency range , receivers are usually broad-band devices such as to make this type of noise appreciable . The latter is sometimes referred to as theoretical first-circuit noise . Its level for a given bandwidth is relatively fixed and therefore constitutes a convenient datum * with which other low powers may be compared . // The type of noise arising in electronic devices likewise depends on temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of which are under our control . Although improvements have already been made , the level of this type of noise is still several times theoretical first-circuit noise . Since a reduction of noise is quite as important in improving signal-to-noise ratios as an increase in transmitter power , this is a productive field of research . Considerations of Adaptability Because radio waves in this frequency range may be depended on only for line-of-sight distances , they might at first sight appear to have a very limited scope of application . It turns out , however , that these distance limitations are largely offset by the increased bandwidth that they provide . In addition , these extremely high frequencies make possible high directivities and a correspondingly low level of primary power . Thus it becomes economically feasible to transmit to the horizon and there retransmit to the next horizon beyond . This may he continued to distances of many hundreds of miles . It also turns out that these very high directivities make possible high-definition radar . Best frequencies both for communications and for radar are usually compromises between increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other . Optimum frequencies for these services have not yet been arrived at . Radar and radio repeater systems represent the major aplications so far made of this frequency band , but being a relatively new range , other applications may be expected . // Future Development The foregoing discussions strongly suggest that at some frequency between 6,000 and 10,000 mc rain becomes a factor which must be taken into consideration and at much higher frequencies it may become a serious limitation . At another frequency centering at about 22,300 mc ( = 1.34 cm ) further absorption results from water vapor . Still further on at 60,000 me ( X = 0.5 cm ) and again at 120,000 me ( X = 0.25 cm ) very substantial attenuation results from oxygen absorption . Together , these three sources of absorption might appear to be a formidable barrier to progress . But it should be remembered that , as radio has progressed to its present frontier in the frequency spectrum , other points have likewise been reached where the outlook was unpromising . It is significant that in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very useful medium of communication . ' Upon reviewing the history of radio , it is readily apparent that methods and techniques have changed enormously . Thus at the extremely high frequencies with which this section is concerned , the type of radio used is vastly different from that at the so-called VHF used in broadcasting television . Perhaps the next step in progress will likewise reveal another very different kind of radio ( or at least of electrical // communication ) . The nature of that step and the direction in which it will take us represent one of the more interesting developments that lie ahead . One of the attractive possibilities for future communication is a scheme in which wave power is led from one point to another through hollow metal pipes . In such a pipe the transmission medium is sheltered from rain , conditioned for water vapor , and if necessary freed from oxygen . Thus the medium , which in the radio case is subject to all the vagaries of weather , would presumably now be largely within our control . It should be noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be radio but will be a particular kind of transmission line . It is of interest that its success depends in no small measure on the use of a very special wave configuration , somewhat like a smoke ring in form , having the unique property of attenuating wave power progressively less as the frequency is indefinitely increased . The concept of a waveguide transmission line of this kind is not new . Indeed , research on such lines has been in progress for many years.12 In fact , it was a by-product of this research which led to the critically important circuit elements and certain of the highly directive antennas that have made possible the extensive use of radio frequencies above 3,000 mc . If the waveguide transmission line becomes a reality , as now seems probable , we shall have experienced the interesting evolution of electrical communications started by Morse more than a century ago using extremely LF waves guided by a wire transmission line , extending first to radio and much higher frequencies and later back to guided transmission , this time at frequencies far beyond any originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BASIC ASSUMPTIONS The purpose of Chap . 3 is to prepare an ideal allocation table , based on present knowledge , present and prospective needs , and current trends , such as might be set up using the information presented in Chap . 2 , on the assumption that no radio services or facilities exist and that the money which has been spent and the knowledge gained are now available to start a new radio industry . Furthermore , it is assumed that the world is peaceful and that all peoples are cooperating to make the best and most efficient use of available facilities ; no consideration therefore has been given to political and military factors . The aim is to prepare an allocation table which will provide the peoples of the world with the radio services which they deem essential in the best and most economical manner . It is fully realized that such an allocation is not practicable for world adoption today and that an ideal allocation can never be achieved . Nevertheless consideration of an ideal table of allocations yields interesting information and may be a useful reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed service is defined by international regulation as " A service of radio communication between specified fixed // points . " The word " specified " is included in the definition in order to establish the difference between fixed service and certain broadcast services , the intention being that the fixed service shall include all communication by radio between established stationary communication points and through relays along established communication routes . The demand for radio service has always outgrown the useful spectrum space very soon after the technical means for using a given frequency range were known . For this reason international agreements and domestic regulations have subdivided most of the services in accordance with specific uses , giving priority to those considered to be the most important . At present , administrative and political considerations , theories of economics , and the inflexibility of statutes , rather than engineering factors , govern the allocation to a great extent . The fixed service is divided into parts in accordance with a particular type of fixed service ( aeronautical fixed , for example ) or in accordance with the user or service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , television studio transmitter link , etc . ) . These ulterior considerations have led to the establishment of multiple circuits between certain points , with the result in some instances of waste of valuable frequency space and high cost inherent in multiple staff and facilities . A different type of a subdivision of the fixed service would provide greater efficiency and conserve frequency space , particularly in the HF range . A number of the present fixed services should be combined into a single system providing communication between major centers of population and carrying the normal government and private communication . Special circuits within this network should be available to large users , and priority afforded essential communications . Fixed service between points not regularly or effecAN // tively served by the integrated fixed system may be provided by separate systems used for a particular type of fixed communication . Where emergency traffic is being handled or the traffic load is heavy enough to warrant the use of exclusive frequencies , separate fixed services might also be established . In addition , suggestions are made in Sec. 3.7 , Special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in isolated areas or under particular circumstances . Modern information theory indicates methods of transmitting and receiving greater amounts of intelligence in a given band in a given time . New techniques would not be closely related to presently operating systems . The time required to discover means of employing these new techniques in the fixed communication network can not now be estimated , and therefore continued conservation of the HF spectrum is very important . Within the next ten or twenty years overcrowding of the fixed service bands would be avoided in an ideal system by limiting the use of such frequencies to services which can not be economically provided otherwise . Super-high-frequency relay systems are capable of supplying the necessary bandwidth with good stability , and it is physically possible to establish such a relay to interconnect all the continents . While it is recognized that the system would be expensive and that there would be difficulties in installation and administration , a relay could be built from New York to the southern tip of South America and from New York through Alaska across Bering Strait into Asia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Australia . The greatest overwater distance involved is approximately 90 miles . Alternate or basic circuits might be established over long water routes by aircraft relay , moored ships , or seadromes . A system of this kind would be capable of furnishing wide-band service for written , aural , and visual communica130 RADIO SPECTRUM CONSERVATION lion to all major population centers of the world . Because of the high directivity obtainable , additional circuits could be added along the same routes by selection of repeater locations and frequencies to prevent interference . The HF part of the spectrum could then be devoted to communication between the major world land masses and offshore islands or to isolated areas where the communication requirement does not justify the bandwidth available in the SHF relay . Even when conservation measures are taken and use is made of SHF relays , it will not be easy to fit the communications requirements into the HF band . The most difficult problems are faced in the 4- to 7-me range . At the present state of the art , the required communication bandwidth does not increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the complement of frequencies in each range up to that limit need not be larger than the band available between 4 and 7 mc . The mobile service is internationally defined as a service of radio communication between land and mobile stations and between mobile stations . The mobile services are subAN // divided into maritime mobile , land mobile , and aeronautical mobile . Mobile services are similar to the fixed services with respect to the suballocations which have been made to specific users and with respect to the kinds of emission and types of traffic . The mobile service commands a priority in the allocation of radio frequencies , because radio is the outstanding ( and often only ) means of providing communication from and between mobile units and because communication is needed for the protection of life and property in the operation of aircraft , ships , and land vehicles . The maritime mobile service is one of the oldest radio services . Its safety function is well established by domestic and international regulation as to both frequencies available and the procedures to be used . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most of the communication is paid message traffic by telegraph and telephone and open to public correspondence . On the other hand , mobile communication in the aeronautical field is limited primarily to operational traffic because of the character of present demands for service , the lack of frequency space , and the great dependence placed on communication for aeronautical navigation and traffic control . In the latter service , both telegraph and telephone are used , with telephone predominating . The aeronautical and land mobile services have expanded eery rapidly . Because of this rapid expansion and the lack of sufficient frequency space , the kinds of communication in which these services are permitted to engage have been restricted . Until very recently , all the aeronautical and land mobile services were limited to operational traffic and not open to general public correspondence . At present each user in a given type of mobile service operates his own epmmunication system . Direct communication between the mobile services and direct communication // between a mobile unit and other networks are technically possible but not as yet widely practiced . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obtained by the integration of a number of the present mobile services . Such a general mobile network interconnected with the fixed network where required would provide improved service to many of the present intermittent users and sufficient facilities for additional users . Large or essential mobile operations may require special facilities within the mobile network or a priority of use . There will remain mobile operations which should be conducted separately using their own system , the occupation of additional frequencies justified by the amount of traffic handled , the improved control of the system , or the greater dependability . Other types of mobile service for special purposes are discussed in Sec. 3.7 , Special Services . The mobile service must be provided with frequencies suitable for medium- and long-distance communication , for short-distance communication on land and to ships on inland waters or harbors , and for short-distance communication to aircraft . The medium- and long-distance communication requirements can be met on frequencies between 2 and 25 mc , the short-distance mobile service on frequencies beginning at approximately 60 mc , and the short-distance aeronautical service on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be provided in the VHF-UHF range for short-distance services , one near 60 mc for coverage of relatively wide areas over average terrain and one near 800 mc to provide service in large cities where multiple reflections may be used to fill in deeply shadowed areas . It is assumed that an integrated navigational system for aircraft multiplexed to provide communication will reduce the separate operational communication requirement and that the aircraft use of these frequencies could be devoted // primarily to meet future demand for public correspondence . Because of the very considerable interference range of highaltitude aircraft transmitters , VHF and UHF aircraft frequencies must be separated from land and maritime frequencies . Frequencies below 2 me are not proposed for mobile service because of the limited bandwidth available and because of the inefficiency of antennas on mobile units i n this frequency range . The present 500-kc safety operations would be transferred to 2 mc . The broadcast service , by international definition , is a radio service intended for reception by the general public . The auxiliary services such as studio transmitter links , remote pickup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services for allocation purposes . Where there are particular and unusual requirements , they would be satisfied in the bands available to the special services . Broadcasting is by all odds the most widely distributed radio service . Many countries which have inadequate fixed and mobile communication maintain multiple broadcast services . The broadcast service is recognized as the most important means of mass communication ever devised . // Although the broadcast service has been limited by insufficient frequency space , its growth has been tremendous , and at the present time aural broadcast service is available by various means to most of the areas of the world . In the heavily populated areas , multiple aural broadcast services are provided ; even in isolated areas as many as 40 different HF broadcast programs may be received during the early evening hours . Aural broadcasting now occupies frequencies from 150 kc to above 100 mc . Governments in general place high importance on their broadcast service . Many government administrations have , in fact , departed from the international allocation table to improve or augment their own broadcasting . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than twice as many broadcast channels are in use as have been allocated . Such operation outside the allocated hands is capable of causing serious interference to other services operating in accordance with international agreements . The early development of broadcasting and the pressure to find room for a large number of broadcast stations have led to allocations having an unsound engineering basis and to operations which are improvident in frequency utilization . It is recognized that the tremendous public investment in broadcast service prevents radical changes in this service and that the determination of the number of programs which should be made available to any area is not an engineering matter . Nevertheless , the engineering factors which determine an efficient broadcast system should be examined in the light of present knowledge . The economics of the present radio broadcast system are based on a very large expenditure by the public for receiving equipment compared with the expenditure for transmitting equipment . Recognizing this , broadcasting transmitters opAN // crate with much greater powers than do transmitters in any other service in order to simplify the receiving problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trend has not been carried far enough and that , in the future , material increases in transmitter power will provide better broadcast reception with greater freedom from noise and with less costly receivers . In addition to the power required , the frequency band in which aural broadcast transmitters operate is important . It should be selected to provide high signal level over large areas , and the transmission should be as stable as can be attained . To meet these requirements ground-wave transmission , because of its stability , should be used to provide service to the majority of receiving locations . For the coverage of large areas , frequencies from 200 to approximately 1,000 kc are well suited . These frequencies , however , are not ideal because of the limited number of channels available and because they are subject to sky-wave interference , particularly at night , if the channels are duplicated within a region . Analysis of the demands of the various nations for broadcast service makes it amply evident that extensive duplication will be necessary , and therefore the nighttime range of stations operating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , where several different programs should be available , VHF sound broadcast stations can . provide high field intensity and stable transmission conditions . If the frequency is above 50 mc , sky-wave interference over long distances does not occur for any appreciable percentage of the time . Other intermittent types of interference can be reduced by sufficient geographical spacing . If one assumes that there are no receivers in the hands of the public and that a sound broadcast system is to be provided on a good engineering basis , the VHF band should be // used for multiple-program service in heavily populated areas and LF service should be provided for the large , sparsely populated areas . The LF transmitters should operate with very high power and should be so located that they provide optimum coverage of the area involved . It is recognized that the inherent higher cost of VHF receivers tends to retard the use of VHF frequencies for local coverage , but the better service rendered would appear to more than compensate for this additional cost . High-frequency broadcasting ( 2 to 25 me ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long distances . Even with extremely high power , the service is subject to wide variations over long and short periods of time , and regular changes of transmitter frequency are required in order to meet changing propagation conditions . With equipment of simple design , this requires the listener to keep track of such changes so that he can continue to receive programs . There are engineering developments , such as diversity reception , single side band , augmented carrier , etc. , which could be employed to aid in overcoming some of the difficulties due to HF propagation . However , the limited and specialized audience of these stations makes it difficult from a production standpoint to provide superior receiving equipment at a reasonable cost . High-frequency broadcasting is used for the interchange of cultural programs to supplement domestic broadcasting in countries where the area to be covered is great and the MF broadcast service is not well distributed or of insufficient power , to transmit programs from mother countries to colonies , and for the transmission of programs from a country to its nationals in other countries or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used for the transmission of propaganda by some countries . Under the peaceful conditions assumed in this chapter , there would be complete I // freedom of information among countries and the transmission , under arrangements which would be the subject of agreement , would be accomplished at great conservation of frequency space . The transmission of cultural programs by means of HF broadcasting does not appear to be sound from an engineering standpoint because of the inferior quality of transmission by this means and because of the difficulty of capturing a large audience when high-quality domestic service is available to the majority of the listeners . Ideally the interchange of cultural programs should take place by means of program relay over high-quality fixed circuits or by electrical Transcriptions or tape recordings subsequently broadcast over the domestic system of the country concerned . By this means the programs can be arranged to suit requirements of individual countries and the originating country can be assured of the greatest possible audience . The domestic use of ground-wave transmission at high frequencies is unsatisfactory . Even in tropical zones it has been shown that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See Chap . 2 of the International Radio Consultative Committee , Study Group 10 report . ) Some countries employ a special form of HF domestic sky-wave broadcasting wherein the government provides special receivers at public places in isolated communities for general listening . Such receivers can be enabled to make the best use of the unstable HF transmission . . High-frequency broadcasting would appear to be the only economically practicable present means of reaching the nationals of a given country on the high seas or in other countries . However , the number of such persons is small compared with the total number of people which radio must // serve , and it is doubtful if a large amount of valuable IW space should be devoted to such a specialized service . Special arrangements can readily be made in the fixed and mobile service for the transmission of news and special events on occasions . In view of the foregoing , an ideal allocation would not provide for the operation of HF broadcast stations for reception by the general public . A major trend in broadcast service is toward maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ television ) requiring wide bands and a stable transmission medium . This combination of requirements limits television broadcasting to frequencies above approximately 50 mc ' Television should be allocated a continuous band . Present growth of the television service indicates that a minimum of four television programs should be available to each major population center and that very large cities should have as many as eight . To satisfy this requirement in the United States , the band should be about 600 me in width . Power of the transmitters should be of the order of 500 kw or more , and the transmitting antennas as high as feasible in order to provide a reasonable distribution of system cost between transmitter and receivers and further to improve the service . A discussion of broadcast service would not be complete without mention of the several systems of distributing broadcast programs by wire which in many cases have rendered service in areas not adequately covered by the radio broadcast services . These systems have proved economical and also assure better reception quality . In many parts of the world central receiving stations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then distributed to the listener over the telephone network or a separate wire system . // In the United States a number of wired television systems have been developed recently to provide programs in areas where home reception is difficult because of the distance floor the television stations or other factors . Some of these systems are designed to provide programs directly rather than by reception from a television broadcast station . Demand for facsimile broadcast service has not developed at the present time to any great extent , probably because of the efficiency of other means of distribution of printed matter within heavily populated areas . It is quite possible that facsimile service for rural areas will become of importance , and apparently this can be most easily provided through the off-hour or multiplex use of aural broadcast stations . Amateur radio is a worldwide hobby embraced by over 100,000 persons in all walks of life having a purely personal interest in various phases of radio technique . The individual interests in amateur service are as varied as are the interests of the people engaged in this hobby . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its various forms , others in the technical aspects , and still others in scientific research . The contribution of the amateur to the technical and practical development of radio is recognized by all , as is the fact that such a large group of citizens devoting their own time // and money to the study of the various phases of radio operation constitutes an extremely valuable source of trained personnel . In case of disaster the equipment and capability of the amateur service are important in the preservation of life and property . To encourage the continuation of this valuable hobby and to take into account the variety of interests represented , appropriate frequency bands in various parts of the spectrum should be provided . Provision should also be made for wideband as well as narrow-band types of operation so that experimentation and investigation by amateurs will not be restricted . The amateurs present a difficult allocation problem because of their numbers and because of the difficulty of weighing the importance of amateur service in a given frequency range as against other services which must occupy the same frequency range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced in size from time to time while the number of amateurs has increased . The resulting interference has , on the one hand , restricted those amateurs interested in communication and , on the other hand , encouraged the development of types of equipment capable of operating under the increasingly difficult conditions . The ideal allocation for the amateur service would include a number of frequency bands in harmonic relation , where possible , the width of the band to be determined by the amount of space required in that region by other services carefully determined to have priority . Amateurs should be permitted to use the industrial , scientific , and medical bands , since some communication can be accomplished even in the presence of severe interference and in addition the amateur may well develop techniques which will help to overcome interference . // Radio Location Services Radio has been used for location and ranging , particularly in connection with navigation , for a great many years . Radio direction finding has been used in the maritime and aviation services almost as long as radio has been used for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been developed pulse devices such as radar and loran and phase or frequency comparison systems such as FM altimeters and Consol . Radio location and ranging are used primarily as means of navigation , but radar systems and others are also used for the determination of exact locations over water or swamps where no other means are available . Other uses of radio location and ranging are to determine the location and direction of travel of unidentified aircraft and of storms and for scientific purposes such as ionospheric sounding . // Aeronautical Radio Navigational Services Because of the ever-increasing speed and density of aeronautical traffic , the trend toward all-weather flying , and the lack of defined tracks in the three-dimensional medium traversed , the aeronautical service places increasing reliance oil the use of radio for navigation and control purposes . Presentday air traffic is dependent upon a number of radio aids which have been developed gradually over the years . Although the requirements for a complete system of radio aids to aviation have been well formulated , the existence of serviceable equipment providing separate functions will necessarily impede implementation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aeronautical aids required for overland flying may all be provided in a single band centering at about 1,000 Inc . The requirement for long-distance aeronautical navigation can be met by a system utilizing low frequencies . This determination assumes that a complete navigational service would be established in the 1,000-me range for all overland aeronautical lanes where traffic is heavy and allweather flying is permitted . It further assumes that the control of the system will be on the ground , where adequate facilities are available , and that no military , commercial , or private aircraft may be flown unless equipped with an essential minimum of radio equipment to ensure its safety and the safety of other aircraft . For off-route flying some of the same aids may be used . For particular purposes air-borne radar is desirable , for example , as a collision warning device in off-route flying . It could be operated in the 9,000-me band which is suggested below for maritime radar . The aeronautical service has been given the highest priority in the past because safety of life is involved in its operations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore , a large amount of space has been devoted to aeronautical service and the space has been distributed throughout the frequency spectrum in order to encourage development . While the present trend is toward the integrated system previously noted , the industry is bringing into use new and radically different types of aircraft , and the requirements are certain to change in a short period of time . The ideal allocation should therefore provide for about twice as much spectrum space as is immediately needed in order to permit the simultaneous development of new system components to meet future requirements . There is no indication that the usefulness of frequencies between 500 and 3,000 inc is limited by propagation factors . Rather , in the present state of the art , equipment limitations appear to be the controlling factor . A high-priority service should operate at the lowest frequency at which sufficient bandwidth is available . In the case of the over-all aeronautical navigation system it would appear that the band should center at about 1,000 me . Maritime Radio Navigational Services The present indications are that the maritime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accuracy and a short-distance aid for use in restricted waters and near port where traffic is heavy . The long-distance requirements can be met through the use of the same LF , longdistance aid which aircraft uses when flying over water . For short-distance , shipboard radar with appropriately placed passive or active responders and in some cases land-based radar for harbor traffic coordination will be sufficient . The shipboard radar may be used as an anticollision device in the open sea . In certain instances for medium-range offshore operations it may he desirable to provide a radiolocation or navigation system for special purposes . // Land Radio Navigational Service At the present time there is no indicated need for a navigation service for mobile units operating on land except in remote desert areas . Should such a need develop , it can probably be integrated with the navigation service provided for the aeronautical and maritime services . However , since no medium-range service is available over rough terrain in the frequency bands proposed previously , and since there is a requirement for a medium-distance radio location service , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near 900 mc should be made available for either land-navigation or medium-distance location services . There are a large number of existing and potential radio services which , because of their peculiar nature or particular need , are best treated as " special services . " Some of these services are part of a regular service but have requirements sufficiently different from the general requirements to warrant separate consideration . An excellent example is the standard frequency service which is a broadcast service , but not a program service . Other examples are meteorological services which include operations similar to those provided under other service designaAN // tions but require special treatment because of the difference between meteorological requirements and other requirements for a comparable type of operation . Forestry and conservation interests require fixed and mobile service but , by the nature of their operations , need these services in areas where fixed and mobile services would not otherwise be provided . There are numerous beneficial uses of radio for short-range communication and control which can not be provided within the framework of the services previously discussed . Lower power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on large construction projects , farmers , and even fishermen . Such communications do not require protection from interference and with a power limitation could be established in a reasonably small band . In a " citizens ' radio service , " for example , any citizen might be permitted to operate a radio transmitter for short-range communication on a party-line basis with no protection from interference by other users of the same service . These special services are so varied that it is impossible to analyze all of them and difficult to discern their trend , except that more and more uses for such services are being considered daily . Frequencies throughout the HF band should be continued for the standard frequency service , and suitable frequencies provided for forestry and conservation . Other special services may be established in four parts of the spectrum , namely , 10 to 120 kc , 1 to 2.5 mc , 20 to 50 mc , and 1,900 to 2,400 mc . The middle two ranges are transition bands between basic types of propagation and as such are subject to serious sky-wave interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmission because of the relatively limited time that such transmission is effective . These bands would be devoted to the various types of low-power special service which can tolerate interference // or which , because of the very short communication range , would not usually be subject to interference . The range 10 to 120 kc is useful for special fixed services in polar regions and for certain other fixed operations and is well suited to general broadcasts of information to be received over wide areas . Portions of the bands may be set aside for particular special services such as forestry and conservation . In the special services , provision should be made for unforeseen uses of radio . It may be reasonably expected that most new uses will be within the basic service definitions and therefore could be included with the allocation to such services . Those which are completely new may be placed in bands not fully occupied by a regularly allocated service , or if they are of sufficient importance , a reallocation can be made . It is not believed desirable to leave portions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither the best position in the spectrum nor the width of the spectrum can be determined until the use to which it is to be put is decided upon . Experimental bands of frequencies have not proved ideally useful , and it is considered that experimentation should take place on the most appropriate frequency with provisions to prevent interference with established services . In this brief discussion it is impossible to consider alI the radio uses which may be included under the special services . A few examples will serve to indicate this approach to the problem and permit the reader to expand along the lines indicated . The meteorological requirements , for example , include fixed circuits which would be part of the regular fixed service and mobile circuits to aircraft and ships which would be in the mobile service . There may be other meteorological requirements which fit into the normal service patterns established , but in addition , frequencies are required for balloon radio sounding , radar storm tracking , and many // other special types of radio operation . It is proposed that these special requirements be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis or by suballocation . Another unusual use is mobile pickup of television , not to be confused with the usual remote pickup , which would be carried by the fixed network . Television from a moving truck , aircraft , ship , or other conveyance where the pickup is made while in motion would be included in the special services bands . In industrial , scientific , and medical uses , radiation is incidental to the primary purpose or , if radiation is essential , intelligence is not conveyed . The conveying of intelligence is , for the purpose of this distinction , broadly defined to include the kind of intelligence obtained in the case of radio location and ranging , telemetering , remote control of devices , as well as ordinary communication . The industrial , scientific , and medical uses are therefore confined to heating and other reactions which occur in substances because of the presence of rapidly varying electric fields . The use of radio-frequency generators for heating is very old . Their use for the heating of the elements in vacuum tubes for the removal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent years many new processes have developed // which depend upon the use of radio frequency for heating , and the present trend is toward the use of this means to speed and make more efficient many industrial processes . It is certain that , with expenditure of sufficient money , incidental radiation from these devices capable of causing interference to the communication and radio location services can be suppressed . However , in the present state of the art the public interest requires that some of these devices be built cheaply and used in circumstances where control of the amount of radiation is not economically feasible . It appears desirable , therefore , to provide frequency bands in which such devices may be operated . Certain frequency ranges are required to perform certain types of operation , the frequency being determined , for example , by the physical size of the material to be treated or the dielectric constant of the material . At the present time , frequencies throughout the spectrum are used for this purpose . If bands were provided for all these uses , there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since the only reason for not suppressing radiation from these devices is economic , one is faced with the problem of weighing the amount of spectrum space demanded against the cost of adequate shielding and other measures . These operations are not capable of interfering with each other and all units of a single type can operate on one frequency occupying very little spectrum space , provided the problem of maintaining adequate frequency stability is solved . The ideal allocation would provide a number of bands in harmonic relation below 100 me and several bands above 100 Inc , the bandwidth being limited to reach a compromise between the cost of suppressing radiation and of maintaining adequate frequency stability .
