There is a tale that during World War II , when Colonel Frederick Wildman , aide to General " Hap " Arnold , flew around the world with his chief , a second plane loaded with fine wines trailed their aircraft . To the friends responsible for this legend it is as difficult to think of Wildman roughing it without a fine Moselle for his fish and a choice of clarets and Burgundies for meat and game as it is to imagine Pancho Gonzales without a tennis racket or Van Cliburn without a piano . // Anyway , as president of Bellows &amp; Co. from 1933 till its dissolution in 1952 and since then a senior partner of Frederick Wildman &amp; Sons , fine wine importers , the Colonel , as he is still affectionately called , has had ample opportunity both in public and in private to exercise his notable nose , his discriminating palate and his exceptional stirring elbow . // This last is especially evident in his own dining room , for both at his New York town house and at a country house in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Mrs. Wildman is a patient as well as a lucky woman . ) What 's more , although both these households are adequately staffed , the Colonel will rarely tolerate the cooking of principal dishes by anyone else  --  particularly if the choice is game . // Though he has traveled and has found excellent sport in many countries of the world , the Colonel is an old-fashioned New Englander at heart who really most enjoys shooting over his own dogs ( Brittany spaniels ) , on his own native heath ( the country around Colebrook ) . The ruffed grouse  --  " pahtridge " in New England  --  woodcock , duck and pheasant that he bags are hung in a most modern walk-in refrigerator at his country place for two to three weeks . Here there is a magnificent kitchen , complete with built-in charcoal broilers and rotisseries ; in town the Colonel has the choice of two kitchens . The picture opposite shows him carving grouse in his office luncheon room in New York  --  birds that were prepared for table by the method described below . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spit I first stuff the properly hung birds with a little celery , celery leaves , parsley , tarragon , etc. , largely to keep them moist . I like to do game birds at medium heat on the electric spit of a rotisserie , cooking them 30 to 40 minutes , depending on the size of the birds , and basting them with the following : // Basting sauce for birds Saut ? one or two chopped shallots lightly in butter , bind with a little flour , add stock made from the extras of the birds ( wingtips , feet , lower legs , neck , gizzards , etc. ) with chicken or smoked turkey broth . Add a fair amount of dry red wine and port wine , twice as much dry wine as port . If port wine is not available a combination of currant jelly , Dijon mustard and a little chutney juice may be substituted  --  the idea is to give a sweet-sour effect . I sometimes also add a little glac ? de viande , or meat essence . The stock must then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cornstarch . Baste the birds with some of this sauce three or four times during the cooking ; to what is left of the sauce add a little more stock and red wine , heat , and pour over the finished birds on a serving platter garnished with watercress . // Special pointers from an expert // To prevent scorching , tie the breasts of delicate birds like chukar partridge with strips of bacon or salt pork before roasting ; remove same when birds are half cooked , to permit browning . // Cut larger birds in half with game shears after cooking ; serve a half to each person on a round of toast spread with foie gras or pheasant liver p ? t ? . // For wild duck : add grated orange peel to the basic sauce given above and pour a teaspoon of cura ? ao over each duck before carving .
