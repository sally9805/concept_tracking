Six years ago a staff member of the Minneapolis Institute of Arts saw a striking pair of portraits in the shop of a Chicago art dealer . They were rare works from the middle period of Lucas Cranach the Elder , one of the great German painters of the early 16th century . The 10-by-16 ? - in. wood panels , described by experts as among Cranach 's finest portraits , show Moritz Buchner , mayor of Leipzig , and his wife Anna , elaborately dressed and richly bejeweled , the man gazing at the world with shrewd but not unkind eyes , the woman modest , grave , rather sad . The portraits roused considerable excitement in German art circles when they were shown in 1928 in Frankfurt , later made their way via Switzerland to Chicago . For six years the Minneapolis Institute of Arts dickered with the Chicago dealer . This week the institute announced acquisition of the portraits . Price for the pair : $42,000.
