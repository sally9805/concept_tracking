All we need see are three chairs , a low sofa and a taboret . Two steps descend from the hall at the back into the room . A Swedish maid , Marget , introduces John Lubbock , twenty-seven , self-assured ; face and bearing under absolute control . LUBBOCK Mrs. Mowbrey wrote me , asking me to call . My name is Lubbock . MARGET Yes , sir . Mrs. Mowbrey is expecting you . She will be down in a moment , sir . She says I 'm to bring you some port . I 'll go and get it . ( Exit Marget . Lubbock , hands in his pockets , whistling under his breath , strolls about examining closely , one by one , the pictures hanging on the wall invisible to us . Marget returns bearing a small tray on which are two decanters and two goblets . She puts them on the taboret . ) There 's port in this one , sir , and sherry in this . Mrs. Mowbrey says you 're to help yourself . LUBBOCK Thank you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestors of Mrs. Mowbrey ? MARGET Oh , yes . Mrs. Mowbrey comes of a very fine family . I 've heard her say that that is her father . As you can see , a clergyman . LUBBOCK ( Casually ) She lives alone here ? p. 3 MARGET Oh , yes . She 's a widow , poor lady . And very much alone . Would you believe it , if I said that no one 's come to the house to call for the whole time I 've been here , except her lawyer man . And , oh yes , the minister of her church . LUBBOCK For several months . MARGET Oh , I 've been here about a year . But today we 're going to have two callers  --  you , sir , and a young lady that 's coming later . Yes , and I must n't forget : when the doorbell rings for the young lady , I 'm to take out the decanters before I open the door . Now I must n't forget that . And then I 'm to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself , wo n't you ? ( Marget goes out . Lubbock , thoughtfully , pours himself a considerable amount of sherry and , sipping it , returns to his examination of the room and the pictures . Enter Mrs. Mowbrey , late fifties , handsome , florid , powdered . She wears a black satin dress covered with bugles and jet . She addresses Lubbock from the hall before descending into the room . ) MRS . MOWBREY Mr. Lubbock , I am Mrs. Mowbrey . LUBBOCK Good afternoon , ma'am . MRS . MOWBREY You do n't know who I am ? LUBBOCK No , ma'am . I got your letter asking me to call . p. 4 MRS . MOWBREY ( Coming forward ) Wo n't you sit down ? ( They sit , Mrs. Mowbrey behind the taboret . ) Mr. Lubbock , I had two reasons for asking you to call today . In the first place , I wish to engage a lawyer . I thought we might take a look at one another and see if we could work together . ( She pauses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean a lawyer to handle my affairs in general and to advise me . ( Same business ) My second reason for asking to see you is that I am your fiance 's aunt . LUBBOCK ( Amazed ) Miss Buckingham 's aunt ! She never told me she had an aunt . MRS . MOWBREY No , Mr. Lubbock , she would n't . I am the black sheep of the family . My name is not mentioned in that house .  --  Will you pour me some port , please . I am glad to see that you have helped yourself Thank you Yes , I am your future mother-in-law 's sister . ( He is standing up , holding his glass  --  waiting ) Our lives took different directions . ( He sits down ) But before we get into the legal matter , let 's get to know one another a little better .  --  Tell me , I have n't seen my niece for fifteen years . Is she a pretty girl ? LUBBOCK Yes  --  very . p. 5 MRS . MOWBREY We 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall ) And a distinguished one . Miss Buckingham would be very interested in seeing these family portraits . MRS . MOWBREY Yes . ( She sips her wine , then says dryly , without a smile ) It 's not hard to find family portraits , Mr. Lubbock . There are places on Twelfth Street , simply full of them . Bishops and generals  --  whatever you want . LUBBOCK ( Continuing to look at them , also without a smile ) Very fine collection , I should say . ( She takes another sip of wine . ) MRS . MOWBREY Mr. Lubbock , I 've made some inquiries about you . You are twenty-seven years old . LUBBOCK Yes , I am . MRS . MOWBREY You took your time finding yourself , did n't you ? All that unpleasantness down in Philadelphia . What happened exactly ? Well , we wo n't go into it . Then you gave yourself a good shaking . You pulled yourself together . Law school  --  very good . People are still wondering where you got all that spending money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one could figure it out . Apparently it was something you were doing up in Harlem .  --  Certainly , your parents could n't afford to give you anything . In fact , you were very generous to them . You bought them a house on Staten Island . You were a very good son to them and I think you 'll make a very good family man . p. 6 LUBBOCK ( With a slight bow and a touch of dry irony ) You are very well informed , ma'am . MRS . MOWBREY Yes , I am . ( She takes another sip of wine ) On Saturday nights you often went to 321 West Street  --  " The Palace , " you boys called it . Nice girls , every one of them , especially Dolores . LUBBOCK ( Mastering violence ; rises ) I do n't like this conversation , ma'am . I shall ask you to let me take my leave . MRS . MOWBREY ( Raising her voice ) You and I have met before , Mr. Lubbock . You knew me under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Higgins ! ! MRS . MOWBREY My hair is no longer blond . ( She rises and crosses the room ) You may leave any moment you wish , but I never believed you were a hypocrite . LUBBOCK ( After returning her fixed gaze wrathfully ; then sitting down again ) What do you want ? MRS . MOWBREY Yes , I owned The Palace and several other establishments  --  refined , very refined in every way . I 've sold them . I 've retired . I see no one  --  no one  --  whom I knew in those days . Except today I am seeing yourself . Naturally , I am never going to mention these matters again . I am going to forget them , and I hope that you will forget them , too . But it would be very valuable to me to have a lawyer who knew them and who was in a position to forget them .  --  I 'll have a little more port , if you 'll be so good . ( Lubbock takes the glass from her hand in silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She murmurs : " Thank you . " He returns and stands by the taboret , talking to her across the length of the stage. ) p. 7 LUBBOCK I do n't believe you asked me here to engage me as your lawyer . There 's something else on your mind . Will you say it and then let me take my leave ? MRS . MOWBREY You were always like that , Jack . LUBBOCK ( Loud ) I will ask you not to call me Jack . MRS . MOWBREY ( Bowing her head slightly ) That was always your way , Mr. Lubbock . Suspicious . Quick to fight . Imagining that everybody was trying to take advantage of you . LUBBOCK What do you want ? I do n't know what you 're talking about . ( He starts with fuming lowered head for the door ) Good afternoon . MRS . MOWBREY Mr. Lubbock , I will tell you what I want . ( He pauses with his back to her ) I am a rich woman and I intend to get richer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think that that is necessary . I want to live . And when you and Katy are married , I want you to help me . ( He is " caught " and half turns ) I want company . I want to entertain . I also want to help people . I want  --  so to speak  --  to adopt some . Not young children , of course , but young men and women who want bringing out in some way or other . I have a gift for that kind of thing .  --  Even in my former work I was able to do all sorts of things for my girls .  --  Did you ever hear anyone say that Mrs. Higgins was mean  --  unkind  --  to the girls in her place ? ( He refuses to answer ; the port is going to her head . She strikes her bosom emotionally ) I 'm kind to a fault . I love to see young people happy . Dozens of those girls  --  I helped them get married . I encouraged them to find good homes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : married a policeman . Happy as a lark . ( She puts a delicate lace handkerchief to her eyes and then to her nose )  --  Will you consent to be my lawyer ? p. 8 LUBBOCK ( Scorn and finality ) My firm does n't allow us to serve family connections . MRS . MOWBREY Oh , I do n't want to have anything to do with that wretched firm : Wilbraham , Clayton , what's-its-name ? All you do for me will be on your own time . I shall start giving you three thousand a year for your advice . Then  --  LUBBOCK I beg your pardon . It 's entirely out of the question . MRS . MOWBREY ( After a slight pause ; in a less emotional voice ) Yes , yes . I know that you are always ready with your no ! no ! You have n't yet heard what I can do for you . And I do n't mean in the sense of money . There is something you are greatly in need of ( Pause ) John Lubbock . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good one , I suspect .  --  So , you looked about you and you selected my niece ? LUBBOCK Oh , much more than that . I 'm very much in love with your niece . You should know her . Katy 's an extraordinary girl . MRS . MOWBREY Is she ? There 's nothing very extraordinary about her mother ? What 's extraordinary about Katy ? LUBBOCK Why , she 's I feel that I 'm the luckiest man in the world . p. 9 MRS . MOWBREY Come now , Mr. Lubbock . You do n't have to talk like that to me . LUBBOCK ( Earnestly ) I assure you , I mean it . MRS . MOWBREY ( A touch of contempt ) Very clever , is she ? Reads a lot of books and all that kind of thing ? LUBBOCK No-o . ( With a slight laugh ) But she asks a lot of questions . MRS . MOWBREY ( Pleased ) Does she ? So do I , Mr. Lubbock , as you have noticed . ( She rises and starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She asks lots of questions . I like that .  --  I asked her to call this afternoon . LUBBOCK ( Startled and uneasy ) You did ? Did you tell her that I would be here ? MRS . MOWBREY No . I thought I would surprise her . LUBBOCK Katy does n't like surprises . ( Preparing to leave , with hand outstretched ) I think that at your first meeting with  --  after so long a time  --  you should see her alone . Perhaps I can call on you at another time . MRS . MOWBREY ( Still standing ) What are you so nervous about ? It 's not time for her to come yet , and besides I have this law matter to discuss with you . p. 10 LUBBOCK Thank you .  --  I 'll ask if I can call some other time . MRS . MOWBREY Anyway , perhaps she wo n't come . She 'll have shown my letter to her mother and her mother will have forbidden her to come . Would Katy disobey her mother ? LUBBOCK Yes . MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry you against her mother 's wishes ? LUBBOCK Yes . Very much so . MRS . MOWBREY I see . Tears ? Scenes ? Slamming of doors ? LUBBOCK Yes , I think so . MRS . MOWBREY ( Leaning toward him confidentially , lifted finger ) Katy is like me , Mr. Lubbock . I can feel it with every word you say . ( Still uneasy , Lubbock has been taking a few steps around the room ; he looks up at the ceiling and weighs this thoughtfully : ) LUBBOCK If you told her you were her aunt Yes , I think she will come . Katy likes to know where she stands ; what it 's all about , and that kind of thing . MRS . MOWBREY I see . A lawyer 's wife . As you suggested a few moments ago : she 's inquisitive ? p. 11 LUBBOCK ( With a nervous laugh ) Yes , she is . MRS . MOWBREY And you think I 'm inquisitive , too  --  do n't you ? LUBBOCK Yes , I do . MRS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lubbock . Everybody says we women are inquisitive . Most of us are . We have to be . I would n't give a cent for a woman who was n't . And why ? ( The wine has gone to her head . She emphasizes what she is about to say by tapping with jeweled rings on the taboret ) Because a good deal is asked of us for which we are not prepared . Women have to keep their wits about them to survive at all , Mr. Lubbock . ( She leans back in her chair ) When I was married I did n't hesitate to read every scrap of paper my husband left lying around the house . But ( She leans forward ) as I said , I have some business to discuss with you before Katy comes .  --  Do you always walk about that way ? LUBBOCK ( Surprised ) People tell me I do . I do in court . If it makes you uneasy  --  MRS . MOWBREY I would like to ask another thing . When you are married  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large check , I assure you  --  I want you both to give me the opportunity to meet some of your friends , young people in whom I could take an interest . New York must be full of them . But most of all I want to see you two . I want you to feel that this house is your second home . ( Very emotional ) I will do everything for you . I have no one else in the world . I will do everything for you . ( Again she puts her handkerchief to her face ) Now I 've talked a good deal . Have you anything to say to all this ? p. 12 LUBBOCK ( After rising and taking a few steps about ) Mrs. Mowbrey , I like people who talk frankly , as you do , and who go straight to the point . And I 'm going to be frank with you . There 's one big hitch in what you propose . MRS . MOWBREY Hitch ? LUBBOCK Katy . ( He looks directly at her and repeats ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say about my professional life .  --  And I want to thank you for the confidence you express in my ability to be of service to you . ( He looks up at the ceiling in thought ) But about those other points : I do n't know . I tell you frankly , Mrs. Mowbrey , I 'm in love with Katy . I 'm knocked off my feet by Katy . But I feel that I do n't know her . How can I put it ? I 'm I 'm even afraid of Katy . MRS . MOWBREY ( Almost outraged ) What ? A man like you , afraid of a mere girl ! LUBBOCK ( Short laugh ) Well , perhaps that 's going too far ; but I swear to you I still ca n't imagine what it will be like to be married to Katy . ( His manner changes and he goes to her briskly as though to shake her hand ) Really , I think it 's best that I say good night now . Katy will want to see you alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-bye . And ask if I may call on you at some other time . p. 13 MRS . MOWBREY Nonsense ! What possible harm could there be  --  ? ( The doorbell rings . ) There ! That 's the doorbell . That 's Katy . It 's too late to go now . Do calm down , Mr. Lubbock . ( Enter Marget . ) MARGET That 's the front door bell , Mrs. Mowbrey . Shall I take out the tray ? MRS . MOWBREY Yes , Marget . And be quick about it . ( Marget scutters out with the tray . ) Really , I do n't understand you , Mr. Lubbock . This is not like you at all . There 's nothing to get nervous about . The young girls of today are perfect geese  --  do n't I know them ! Pah ! ( Marget at the door . ) MARGET Miss Buckingham to see you , ma'am . ( Katy , twenty-one , very pretty , stands a moment at the top step and looks all about the room . ) MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Ah , there you are , dear . KATY ( Taking a few steps forward , her eyes on Lubbock ) Aunt Julia , I 'm very glad to see you . MRS . MOWBREY ( Apparently expecting to be kissed ) This is a joy ! ( Katy , approaching her , looks at her smiling , and suddenly drops her reticule which she has opened . Thus avoiding an embrace , she leans over and takes some time picking the objects up . Lubbock and Marget come to her assistance. ) p. 14 KATY Oh , how awkward of me ! I 'm so sorry . I 'm always doing things like this . Thank you . There 's my key and my card case . Thank you . MRS . MOWBREY Marget , we 're ready for tea now . I 'm sure you 'll want some tea , dear . ( Exit Marget . ) KATY Thank you , I would .  --  You 're here , John ? LUBBOCK ( Uncomfortable ) Mrs. Mowbrey wrote me and asked me to call . MRS . MOWBREY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly . Now sit down and let me look at you . ( Katy sits in the chair Mrs. Mowbrey has indicated . ) What a dear , beautiful girl you are !  --  And you 're so like my father ! You 're like me and my father . LUBBOCK ( Reluctantly ) Yes There is something there . MRS . MOWBREY Oh , I 've lost my looks  --  I know that ! I 've been through great unhappiness , but the resemblance is there , there 's no doubt about it . KATY Did you know I was coming , John ? LUBBOCK No , no . KATY Is John going to be your lawyer , Aunt Julia ? p. 15 MRS . MOWBREY I hope so , dear . I certainly hope he will be . That 'll bring us all closer and closer together . KATY Aunt Julia I scarcely remember you . Why why have n't we seen you more often ? MRS . MOWBREY Mildred , dear , your mother and I let 's not talk about it . I 'll just say this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't get on together . I hope your mother 's happy . I wish her every good thing in the world . If she does n't wish to see me , that does n't change anything . I wish her every good thing in the world . You can tell her that any time you wish , Mildred .  --  But Mr. Lubbock tells me you wish to be called Kate ? KATY Yes , I do . MRS . MOWBREY But why ? KATY ( After looking down a moment ) That would take too long to explain , Aunt Julia . MRS . MOWBREY Well , you are a dear original girl , are n't you ? KATY John , are you Aunt Julia 's lawyer ? MRS . MOWBREY He will be . He will be . We 've just settled that . So that both my business and my pleasure  --  my affection , let us hope  --  will be close together . Oh , here 's the tea . ( Enter Marget with the tea service . ) Oh , I have such plans for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 16 KATY AND LUBBOCK : Thank you . MRS . MOWBREY You see , dear , I 've lived too much alone , since my dear husband 's death . That 's not good . That 's not right . And you are going to bring me out .  --  Now tell me , Katy , where are you going to live ? Have you found just what you wanted ? KATY Yes , we have .  --  Thank you . MRS . MOWBREY Splendid ! Tell me , dear , do n't have a moment 's hesitation What will it be : linen ? silver ? KATY Aunt Julia , I do n't like receiving presents . I never have . I may be strange in that , but I do n't . MRS . MOWBREY Presents ! But I 'm your aunt  --  this is the family . KATY ( Clearly ) But we do n't know one another very well yet . ( Mrs. Mowbrey is stopped short . She fumbles with her handkerchief . She begins silently to weep . ) Have you been living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not kind , Mildred . That was not kind . KATY ( Searching herself , softly ) I 'm sorry . I 'm sorry , if I think I 'm supposed to be a very outspoken person , Aunt Julia , but I did n't mean to be unkind . p. 17 MRS . MOWBREY ( Still drying one eye ; but in a low firm tone of instruction ) That means you must have been hurt in life , in some way . I 've seen it often . KATY ( Another glance at John , slowly ) No , I do n't think I have . LUBBOCK ( Floundering , but trying to do his part ) Katy 's right , Mrs. Mowbrey . But when she does make a friend , she 's a real one . MRS . MOWBREY That I believe . And so am I. And I want to prove it to you . I want you to come to feel that this is your second home . I want to be useful to you , in any way . Do you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my name , too ? I was christened Julia ; but I did n't like it . I wanted a name out of the Bible . I liked the story of Esther . I liked her courage . That 's what I like  --  courage . Now will you tell me why you changed yours ? KATY Well I used to read Shakespeare all the time . And I liked the girls in Shakespeare . Even when I was very young Every day I 'd pretend I was a different one . And , you know , they most of them have no fathers or mothers , or else and they have to go live in foreign countries or live in a forest and they even have to change their clothes and pretend they 're men . They 're very much thrown on their own resources . That 's what they learn . There are four or five that I admired most  --  but I knew I would n't be like them . So I chose one of the lesser ones , one of the easier ones  --  p. 18 MRS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't remember its name  --  but that Kate had an awful temper . Mr. Lubbock , has our Kate got an awful temper ? ( Katy stiffens . ) LUBBOCK No , indeed , Mrs. Mowbrey . KATY No , I wish I did . I think people with a temper are lucky . MRS . MOWBREY Lucky ! How could you wish a thing like that . KATY When things seem all wrong to me , I do something worse than have a temper . I turn all cold and stormy inside . It 's as though something were dead in me . MRS . MOWBREY I understand every word of that . Katy , dear , we will be good friends .  --  Now surely there 's some furniture I can lend you , some household appointments ? KATY ( Quietly ) Thank you very much , Aunt Julia . But , of course , we mean to live very simply . And we wo n't be seeing anyone for the first year or two .  --  Will we John ? LUBBOCK ( Floundering ) Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear ! That 's so unwise ! My dear children , you must come and see me  --  and my friends . I have so many friends who will be delighted to meet you : artists and writers and young men in politics  --  so valuable for Mr. Lubbock 's work . And the dear rector of my church , Mr. Jenkins . p. 19 KATY All that 's for John to decide , of course . ( Katy turns inquiringly toward him , as does Mrs. Mowbrey . ) LUBBOCK ( Belatedly he stammers ) Oh , we wo n't be seeing too many people MRS . MOWBREY There 's Judge Whittaker 's son for example . You 'll laugh till the tears run down your cheeks . ( With confidential emphasis to Katy ) Judge Whittaker can do anything in New York  --  anything you ask him Old friend of mine . ( To Lubbock , rising ) People with influence like that  --  you must know them . ( To Katy ) And then I want to take you shopping , dear . Stores where they know me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have n't had to pay the marked price for anything , for years . Friends , friends everywhere .  --  Now I 'm going to leave you two alone together . I know you have a world of things to talk about . ( Katy rises . ) If you want some more tea , just ring and ask Marget for it . KATY ( Always quietly ) Aunt Julia , I can see John perfectly well in my own home . I came to call on you . MRS . MOWBREY ( Moving to the door ) What a sweet thing to say .  --  No , no . I know young people in love ; do n't say I do n't . And beginning today I want you to think of this house as your second home . Besides , I have a present for you and I must go and get it . ( She indicates a ring on her finger ) A very pretty thing , indeed . p. 20 KATY ( Following Mrs. Mowbrey toward the door ; with a touch of firmer protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ten minutes ! I 'll give you ten minutes ! ( She goes out . Katy turns and with lowered eyes goes slowly to her chair . She sits and covers her face with her hands . ) KATY ( As though to herself ) I ca n't understand it What a dreadful , dreadful person . LUBBOCK ( Uncomfortable ) Come now , Katy . It 's not as bad as all that Of course , she 's a little odd ; but I imagine she 's been through a lot of trouble of some sort . ( Katy looks at him a moment and then says with great directness : ) KATY What has she done , John ? ( He does n't answer ) It must be something serious . Mother wo n't talk about her one minute !  --  Tell me ! What is it ? LUBBOCK Well uh she may have made some wrong step early in life . Something like that . KATY ( After weighing this thoughtfully ) No . My mother would have forgiven that It must be something much worse . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's in the past . KATY ( Shakes her head ; she gives a shudder ) It 's there  --  now . ( Always very sincerely , this as though to herself ) I do n't even know the names of things . Except what I 've read about . In books . ( Brief pause ) ( As with an effort to say such an awful thing ) Was she a usurer ? LUBBOCK What 's that ?  --  Oh , a usurer . ( With too loud a laugh ) NO , no  --  she was n't that ! KATY Was she a perjurer ? LUBBOCK Katy , where do you get these old expressions ? I do n't know , but I guess she was n't that . KATY ( Gravely pursuing her thought ) Was she that other kind of bad person . That word that 's in the Bible and in Shakespeare ( This takes solemn courage ) that begins with " double-you " with " double-you aitch "  --  ? ( This takes a minute to dawn on Lubbock . He reacts violently ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Katy ! ! How can you say such a thing . p. 22 KATY I do n't know how to pronounce it . LUBBOCK Do stop this ! Put this all out of your head , please . KATY But she 's my own aunt . I must have some idea to go by . Mother wo n't say a word . She just bursts into tears and leaves the room . LUBBOCK Please , Katy .  --  For Heaven 's sake , change the subject . KATY I do n't want to know anything that it 's unsuitable for me to know . But I do n't want to live with people hiding things from me . I do n't think ignorance helps anybody . I can see perfectly well that you know the answer : Was Aunt Julia that thing that beings with " double-you " ? LUBBOCK I 'm not going to answer you , Katy . This conversation is unsuitable . Very unsuitable . KATY ( Who has kept her eyes on him ; calmly ) Then she was . LUBBOCK No  --  I did n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that ?  --  Probably , she was just connected with such things  --  at a distance . KATY How do you mean ? LUBBOCK She was n't in it herself She just  --  sort of  --  stood by I 'm not going to stay here another moment . Where 's that woman put my hat ? p. 23 KATY I see She arranged them . That 's in Shakespeare , too . She was a bawd . LUBBOCK Katy ! KATY It 's in the Bible , too : she was a ( She pronounces the " aitch " ) whoremonger . ( She rises . ) LUBBOCK ( Fiercely ) Stop this right now . How can you say such ugly words ? KATY Are there any others that are n't ugly ?  --  Anyway , now I know . ( She quickly moves up toward the entrance . ) LUBBOCK Where are you going ? KATY ( From the steps ) You do n't want me to stay , do you ? LUBBOCK Think a moment , Katy . Stop and think . KATY Think what ? LUBBOCK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to be charitable about people 's mistakes . About Mary Magdalene and all that . KATY ( Turning in deep thought ) Yes , it should , should n't it ?  --  But Mary Magdalene was n't the second thing ; she was the first . ( She returns to her chair and sits , her eyes on the floor . Again as though to herself ) I do n't know anything about anything . ( She suddenly looks at him and says with accusing directness ) And you 're not helping me . Tell me what I should think . Are you going to be like this always ? When I ask questions ? p. 24 LUBBOCK ( Urgently ) No , Katy . I promise you . I 'll answer anything you ask me ! KATY When ? LUBBOCK When we 're married .  --  But not here ! Not now !  --  Today , anyway , put all this out of your head . KATY ( Reluctantly acquiescent , rises again ) When we 're married . That 's like what Mother 's always saying : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( Turning to him with decision ) But if she is those things  --  those things that Shakespeare said  --  LUBBOCK Do n't say them ! KATY Promise me that you 'll never see her again . LUBBOCK Now , K-a-a-ty ! She 's a client . In business we ca n't stop to take any notice of our client 's morals KATY In business they do n't ? I mean : thieves and criminals ? Do n't men meet that kind of people all the time ? LUBBOCK ( Putting his hands over his ears ) Questions ! Questions ! You 're going to drive me crazy . KATY ( Looking around the room , musingly ) And all this money came from that ! ( Her eyes return to him ) And when she asks us to come here to dinner ? p. 25 LUBBOCK Of course , we do n't have to come often . But she 's a lonely woman who 's trying to put the mistakes of her life behind her . Be kind , Katy . Be charitable ! KATY ( Weighs this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LUBBOCK Mrs. Mowbrey ? ( Loud laugh of protest ) Of course not . ( Katy goes to the hall . From the top step she turns and says with great quiet but final significance : ) KATY And you want me to invite her to the wedding ? ( Lubbock can not answer . His jaw is caught rigid . Katy returns into the room , drawing a ring off her finger . ) All I know is what I read in Shakespeare and the Bible . That 's all I have to go by , John . Nobody else helps . You do n't help me . I 'm giving you back your ring . ( She puts the ring on the taboret and goes quickly , with lowered head , out of the house . The front door is heard closing . Lubbock stands rigid . Slowly he goes to the taboret and takes up the ring . Mrs. Mowbrey appears at the hall indignant . ) MRS . MOWBREY Who went out the front door ? Was that Katy ? ( He puts down the ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mowbrey . She went home . MRS . MOWBREY ( Coming in ) Without saying good-bye to me ! Her own aunt ! Well  --  there 's a badly brought up girl ! ( Sitting down ) What did she say ? LUBBOCK She left no message . MRS . MOWBREY I 'm ashamed of her , Mr. Lubbock . I never heard of such behavior . The idea ! ( Seeing the ring ) What 's this ? What 's this ring ? LUBBOCK She left it . It 's her engagement ring . MRS . MOWBREY She broke her engagement ? ( Rising ) Mr. Lubbock , listen to me ! You can call yourself a very lucky man . One look at her , and I could see she was n't the right girl for you .  --  Left without saying one word of good-bye ! I do n't know what 's become of the girls these days . A niece of mine  --  behaving like that . ( Giving him the ring and wagging her finger in his face ) Now you must put that in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl for you . They are n't all dead yet . You 're going to find some splendid girl and I 'm going to make a second home for you here . We 're going to have fun . You only live once , as the Good Book says . p. 27 LUBBOCK You did this ! Look ! ( Holding the ring toward her ) She 's gone .  --  You with your conniving and sticking your nose into other people 's business . WHY the hell did you have to put your goddamned nose into my affairs ? MRS . MOWBREY I have never allowed profanity to be used in my presence . LUBBOCK Well , you 'll hear it now . You  --  with your sentimental whining about wanting friends . You 'll never have any friends . You do n't deserve to have any friends . God , have you wrecked your chances today !  --  While you were wrecking mine . ( She has descended coolly into the room . Lubbock passes her toward the hall . ) You can sit here alone for ever and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that girl put my hat ? MRS . MOWBREY Yes , Mr. Lubbock , you go and you stay away . You have just shown yourself to be the biggest fool I ever saw . It was n't I that lost you that girl ; it was yourself . And you deserve to lose her . LUBBOCK How do you know what happened ? MRS . MOWBREY I will ring and Marget will get your hat . ( She pulls a bell rope . The waiting . ) Katy is my niece . Every inch my niece . She put you to the test and you were ( Vituperatively ) Shown up . Shown up . Oh , you men ! On your high saddles . p. 28 LUBBOCK I tried to save you , anyway . MRS . MOWBREY I never saw anyone so stupid . ( Enter Marget . ) MARGET Yes , Mrs. Mowbrey . MRS . MOWBREY Mr. Lubbock 's been looking for his hat , Marget . MARGET Yes , ma'am . ( Marget disappears and returns with a straw hat . Lubbock takes it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs . ) LUBBOCK Well  --  out with it . What should I have done ? MRS . MOWBREY In the first place you should have lied , of course . Strong and loud and clear . A girl like that is not ready to learn what she wants to know . And at this stage it 's not your business or mine to tell her . LUBBOCK She said she left me because I was n't any help to her . Is lying any help ? MRS . MOWBREY Of course it is . I suppose you think you were trying to tell her the truth ? Young man , you 're not old enough to tell the truth and it does n't look as though you ever will be . In the first place , you should have lied , firmly , cleanly . THEN , you should have shown her that you were her friend . Katy did just right . Katy left you standing here , because she saw that you never would be her friend  --  that you have n't the faintest idea what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in my own life . It 's taking place all the time . Mr. Lubbock , people do n't like to be  --  ( Lubbock rises , crosses the room and says aggressively and a little brutally : ) p. 29 LUBBOCK Mrs. Mowbrey , this has all been very interesting ; and you 've played your various cards very neatly and all that , but I want to know why you really asked me to come and see you today . MRS . MOWBREY ( Also getting tougher ) I am coming to that . ( She pauses ) Do you prefer to stand ? LUBBOCK ( Shortly ) Yes , I do . MRS . MOWBREY There 's one event in your life  --  in our lives  --  that I 'd like you to explain to me . One night , at The Palace  --  it was in the spring of  --  you lost your head , or rather you lost control of yourself . You broke every bottle in my bar . You did like that with your arm . ( Her arm makes wide sweeping gestures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You terrorized everyone . You did n't strike anyone , but the flying glass could have blinded my girls . You were n't drunk . What happened ? What made you do that ? LUBBOCK ( Furious , but coldly contained ) I paid for it , did n't I ? MRS . MOWBREY Oh , Mr. Lubbock . Do n't talk like a child . You and I know that there are a great many things that ca n't be paid for .  --  Was it something that Dolores said to you  --  or that I said to you ? ( Pause ) Or did that friend of yours  --  what was his name ? Jack Wallace or Wallop ?  --  did he hurt your feelings ? No , it could n't be that ; because you did n't strike him . The only thing you struck was a lot of bottles and you were n't drunk . ( She waits in silence ; finally he says in barely controlled impatience : ) p. 30 LUBBOCK What of it ? What of it ? I lost my temper , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing your temper at people , Mr. Lubbock  --  we all do ; but I ca n't understand your losing your temper at things . LUBBOCK What are you trying to get at , ma'am ? Out with it . Are you trying to tell me that you think I 'm not fit to be the husband of your niece ? MRS . MOWBREY No , indeed . I think you 're just the right husband for her ; and the more I talk to you , the more I think you 're just the right lawyer for me . ( Lubbock is stunned by this sudden shift in Mrs. Mowbrey 's attitude . ) Now , do you know what I have out in the sun porch ? Do you ? ( He shakes his head in confusion ) A bottle of champagne . And do you know what Lena is looking at in the kitchen ? Two great big steaks . LUBBOCK ( Slowly recovering himself ) I do n't really like champagne , Mrs. Mowbrey ; but would you happen to have any bourbon in the house ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six o'clock that 's all I touch . ( Guiding him to the door ) And if you 're a good boy I 'll show you the list of my investments . There are one or two I 'm worried about . Really worried . ( She pauses at the top step ; he beside her . She puts her hand on his arm ) We all have disappointments in life , John  --  every one of us  --  but remember Shakespeare said  --  ( She smiles and taps him significantly on the chest with her jeweled forefinger ) you know  --  ( She laughs and exits . He stands a moment , uncertain , then notices the straw hat still in his hand . He descends into the room , and gazes thoughtfully about . Then he places his straw hat on the taboret , turns and quickly exits in the direction Mrs. Mowbrey has taken . The Lights fade. )
