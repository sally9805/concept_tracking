For months the betting was evenly divided among foreigners in Djakarta that Indonesia 's long-postponed first national election would be postponed still longer . For even an experienced government the problem might have seemed overpowering : to register an honest vote for more than 1,000 candidates , representing 172 parties , by 43 million voters who are more than 50% illiterate and speak some 200 different dialects , at 93,000 polling places in a primitive country that is 3,000 miles long and cut up into 3,000 islands . For the young ( 6 years ) , inexperienced Indonesian Republic , beset with a desperate economic crisis , five concurrent armed rebellions and a government only one month in office , the task might have seemed impossible . <P> But with the dedication and determination of people who had fought long and bitterly for the right to govern their own affairs , the Indonesians persisted . This week , from the crowded streets of Djakarta to the head-hunting regions of Borneo , Indonesians get their chance to elect their leaders . <P> Brother , Brother . To set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Party government of Burhanuddin Harahap used a fleet of 100 yachts and fishing boats , air-force planes , army trucks , oxcarts and 3,500 bicycles to transport ballots . They distributed millions of leaflets , showing the different par ty symbols and explaining to the elector ate the simple mechanics of voting - punching a hole through the symbol of one 's choice . Electoral officers plodded through the jungles to advertise the election with cartoon movies and singing pup pet shows . Sample song : " Let 's all go there , brother , brother . Let 's all go vote ... to be respected and defend the na tional state . " At stake were 260 seats in a parliament that will govern Indonesia at least until year 's end , when a constitutional assembly will be elected to write a permanent constitution for the republic . At issue was whether Indonesia reverts to the neurotic , fuzzily pro-Communist path of the Nationalist government , which fell in July ( TIME , Aug. 1 ) , or chooses to stay on the anti-Communist course of the present Masjumi regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible . <P> Bark Instead of Bite . In last week 's campaign windup at a Communist strong hold near Djakarta , a pretty 24-year-old girl intensely pleaded the Masjumi line : " The Communists stabbed us in the back . . . The welfare of our people depends on Allah , not on Malenkov or Mao Tse-tung . " A crowd of 2,000 barefooted workers and women listened impassively cheered lustily . But a larger crowd a mile away cheered , too , when a Communist speaker harangued against " Dutch imperialism , " and accused the Masjumi of selling out Indonesia to the U.S. Similarly . <P> the Nationalists , like Pavlov 's one-track-minded dogs , preferred to bark at the Dutch rather than bite into the current issues . In a remote Sumatran village a Nationalist screamed : " Politically you are free , economically you are not . Everything is still Dutch . You are guests in your own home . "
