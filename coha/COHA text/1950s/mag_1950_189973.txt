JANE WELSH CARLYLE : A NEW SELECTION OF HER LETTERS ( 355 pp. ) - Arranged by Trudy Bliss-Macmillan ( $3 ) . <P> <P> Dolorous Alfred , Lord Tennyson , always felt " dreadfully embarrassed " when he found himself alone with a woman . But when he paid a visit one day to dyspeptic Thomas Carlyle and found only Mrs. Carlyle at home , he was so promptly disembarrassed by her poise and charm that he stuffed a pipe brimful with stinking shag and harangued her happily for three solid hours , " exactly as if he were talking with a clever man . " And Charles Dickens-to say nothing of Thackeray and John Stuart Mill-felt much the same way about Jane Carlyle . " None of the writing women , " said Dickens , " came near her at all . " <P> Letters to Posterity . In the sense of producing stories or poetry , Jane Carlyle was no " writing woman . " But to posterity she bequeathed a host of letters in which her life and times are portrayed as brilliantly as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it ) in " grains as of gold . " She achieved this perfection of correspondence while suffering from periodic bouts of sleeplessness , racking headaches , and the cares of looking after dour , excessively difficult Thomas-a combination of circumstances that at one period brought her to the very verge of lunacy . <P> When husband Carlyle demanded a soundproof room in which to do his writing , it was Jane who directed its construction . When he was exhausted with overwork , it was Jane who laid him tenderly on the sofa and hushed his sonorous Scots groans by sitting down to the piano and playing " Ye banks and braes o ' bonnie Doon . " When he spent one vacation savoring the simple pleasures of lying under a tree , Jane could not help reminding a friend that there was a very large tree in their own backyard- " but it were too easy to repose under that . " <P> Painful Twinges . For the 40 years of their married life , Jane Carlyle shared every painful twinge of a genius to whom all literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying : " Well ! They may twaddle as they like about the miseries of a bad conscience : but I should like to know whether Judas Iscariot was more miserable than Thomas Carlyle who never did anything criminal , so far as he remembers ! " <P> Her role was made the more arduous by the fact that Thomas could think of nothing but whatever book he happened to be writing at the time , and that his massive projects took years to finish . " I begin to be seriously afraid , " wrote Jane , " that his Life of Cromwell is going to have the same strange fate as the child of a certain French marchioness that I once read of , which never could get itself born , tho ' carried about in her for 20 years . . . A wit is said to have once asked this poor woman if ' Madame was not thinking of swallowing a tutor for her son ? ' So one might ask Carlyle if he is not thinking of swallowing a publisher for his book ? "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
