Clarence Macartney 's fellow students in Princeton Seminary 's Class of 1905 felt a trifle awed when Freshman Macartney began setting out on Sundays to preach in nearby churches , wearing a high hat and a black tailcoat . Many of his colleagues have stayed awed ever since . For 47 years , Presbyterian Macartney , singularly unperplexed by theological doubts , scientists ' criticism , or the pendulum swing of vogues , has been filling churches by preaching the same Gospel he learned at the Seminary . <P> Macartney 's father , a strict Scots Covenanter minister , taught his children* a firm , old-fashioned set of religious beliefs . Young Clarence learned the fine points of oratory from an equally good source . As a University of Wisconsin undergraduate , he used to go down to the elder Bob La Toilette 's office in the Madison courthouse to rehearse his debating speeches . The training helped make him one of the ablest preachers in his church . In 1924 , William Jennings Bryan , an orator himself , proposed him for the one-year term as Moderator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moderator Macartney had led the fight of Presbyterian fundamentalists ( he prefers the term " orthodox " ) to oust the Rev. Harry Emerson Fosdick , leading theological modernist , from the pulpit of Manhattan 's First Presbyterian Church . Attracted by Macartney 's reputation , Pittsburgh Presbyterians asked him , in 1927 , to take over the ministry of their own First Church , long one of the most influential in U.S. Presbyterianism . <P> The new pastor never left Pittsburgh . To two generations of churchgoers , he has preached his same steady brand of orthodoxy , with the same grave eloquence . Sunday mornings and evenings , a good half of his 2,500-member congregation make their way downtown from outlying residential districts to hear him preach . On Tuesdays , as many as 600 local businessmen drop in at the First Church for his noon meetings ( a cafeteria lunch and two short sermons ) . <P> Outside of his pulpit , Bachelor Macartney spends most of his spare time in writing and historical research . A specialist on the Civil War , he has walked over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of his 46 published books are written about historical subjects ( e.g. , a life of McClellan , several studies of Lincoln ) ; the rest are sermons and devotional works . <P> Souls First . Not far from retirement now , Pastor Macartney , 72 , is slightly less pessimistic about the state of the church in the U.S. than he once was . " Modernism , " he says , " is not nearly so belligerent as it was . The barrenness of it has been demonstrated . " But , to a man strong in the fundamentals of the Gospel , the kid-glove handling of the question of sin in many U.S. pulpits is still hard to take . Says Macartney : " One reason why we have so few conversions is that we do n't ask people to repent . "
