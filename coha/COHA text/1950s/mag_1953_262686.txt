Servant or Master ? <P> <P> Everybody knows about the Eisenhower Administration 's struggles with members of Congress . Perhaps more important in the long run is a hidden struggle inside the executive branch of the Government . This is not the too-familiar rivalry between presidential appointees ; the Eisenhower Administration , so far , has been remarkably free of high-level backbiting . The significant struggle is the quiet war of the President and his appointees to get control of the vast governmental machine , manned by civil servants ( and military men ) who operate under protective rules designed to keep them partially independent of their nominal bosses . <P> The permanent establishment of the Government is not supposed to make policy . But it does . It is even more influential in strangling efforts by political appointees to change the quality and direction of Government and to make new policy . <P> A few figures reveal what Eisenhower &; Co. are up against : out of 2,300,000 people on the federal payroll ( exclusive of armed forces ) , the Eisenhower Administration has succeeded in appointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no means all the 2,500 are in key jobs . In the 1,200,000-man Defense Department , there are less than a score Eisenhower appointees . <P> The U.S. public is conditioned to read into this situation the old conflict of patronage-hungry politicians against the merit system . That conflict does exist , and the Administration would have an easier time with Congress if it had some more jobs to dole out . <P> But the patronage drought is relatively a very minor factor in the present struggle . Far more important is the question of whether the men who bear the constitutional and legal responsibility for running the executive branch will , in fact , be able to get into their hands the power to run it . Eisenhower promised the people reduction in the cost of Government , decentralization of power , a stronger and more coherent foreign policy and a more efficient defense policy . Whether he succeeds or fails in these promises depends largely , perhaps mainly , on his ability to get control of the permanent establishment . <P> Reform at a Price . In the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staffs without restriction , took credit or blame for the results . With the rise of political parties and patronage officials began to distribute jobs with an eye more to party spoils than to the nation 's business . <P> As Government services grew more important and more complex , protests arose against the quality of public employees produced by the patronage system . After 20 years of agitation , the Pendleton Act of 1883 established a merit system of appointment for some Government employees . Steadily , but very slowly , the merit system spread within the U.S. Government . Its next sensational gain was made under Theodore Roosevelt , but even at the end of his Administration , little more than 60% of federal civilian employees had civil-service protection . Herbert Hoover extended it further until at the end of his term about 80% of employees were covered .
