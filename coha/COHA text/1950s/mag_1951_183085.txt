When the Federal Communications Commission asked RCA to show its all-electronic color television tube to CBS last October , RCA said no ; it would be like asking the Yankees to give Joe Di-Maggio to the Phillies for the World Series . But last week , RCA unwrapped the tube ( known to the trade as the " Joe DiMaggio " ) for all to see . To 25 tube-makers , RCA sent 14 pages of illustrated instructions on how to make it . At the moment , the instructions will do the manufacturers little good , for FCC has approved only the CBS color system . RCA apparently hopes to build up a string of potential customers for its tube , thus persuade FCC to change its mind and approve RCA 's system .
