There were hopeful signs last week that the depressed steel industry has reached bottom . For the fourth straight week , steel production edged upward , to 54.9% of rated capacity , the best pace since January . " April . " said U.S. Steel Chairman Roger M. Blough , " may have represented the low point . " <P> The remarkable fact is that steel companies have been able to continue making money at such low rates . Only ten years ago , 77-80% of capacity was considered a break-even point for most companies . But since that time the industry has sunk nearly $10 billion into new plants and processes , closed obsolescent mills . Companies are so much more efficient that Republic Steel Chairman Charles M. White could say : " We intend to make money at whatever capacity . " <P> Since the recession in steel , as elsewhere , is spotty , some companies are doing much better than others . U.S. Steel , the nation 's largest producer , is operating at about 54% . Lukens Steel has managed to stay at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates . Inland Steel is operating at 70% , partly because it had a smaller percentage of auto business than other companies . Says Inland Steel President Joseph L. Block : " I guess we 're just selling harder . " Other companies that have been harder hit are beginning to spring back . Youngstown Sheet &; Tube is operating at 50% of capacity after hitting a 1958 low of 45% ; ninth-biggest Colorado Fuel &; Iron has edged up from 42% to 54% , is operating at 70% in some plants . <P> For the steel companies , an upturn can not come too soon . Faced with an automatic rise in steelworkers ' wages on July 1 , the industry will be in a better position to raise steel prices if orders are rising and inventories down . Armco Steel President R. L. Gray said flatly last week that Armco will hike prices when wages go up . While steel companies talk of an $11 hike ( v. last year 's $6 ) , one steelmaker called such a hike " a lot of nonsense , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " <P> <P> Despite the present pickup , steelmakers expect production will fall off again in summer as customers shut down for vacation and the auto industry begins retooling . By fall , they expect to see production rise again , reach about 75% by the fourth quarter .
