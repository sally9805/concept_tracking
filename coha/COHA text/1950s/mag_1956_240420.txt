Harold Dahl was an air-age soldier of fortune with a quiet , ingratiating manner , the face of an unappreciated minor poet-and an astonishing talent for oscillating rapidly between the frying pan and the fire , meanwhile eating well and never getting badly burned . He was also a good pilot-and a very lucky one . <P> Born in 1909 , in Sidney , Ill. , " Whitey " Dahl learned to fly as a U.S. Army cadet , later dropped out of the Air Corps. and by 1937 was ready to launch his flamboyant , horsepower-opera career by marching off to the Spanish civil war with a $1,500-a-month contract to fly and fight for the Republican side . On a bombing mission over the Madrid front , he was shot down , captured and sentenced to death before a Franco firing squad . <P> Black-Market Deals . Before the sentence was carried out , a shapely blonde show girl who signed herself Mrs. Edith Dahl wrote a poignant letter to General Francisco Franco , pleading for her husband 's pardon and thoughtfully enclosed a fetching photograph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Edith 's picture , a letter came back bearing the rebel leader 's signature , with the courtly , old-fashioned Spanish salutation q.b.s.p . ( " I kiss your feet " ) , and promising to spare Dahl 's life . <P> <P> Back in the U.S. in 1940 , Whitey soon was in another jam , arrested for passing bad checks . He was freed next morning when the judge turned out to be a sympathetic fellow member of the Quiet Birdmen , an aviators ' club . <P> Like many another U.S. flyer , Dahl headed for Canada early in World War II to enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force . He became a squadron leader ( equals U.S. major ) and married a Canadian girl , belatedly explaining that his marriage to wife Edith had never been exactly solemnized , from a legal point of view . Before the war ended , Whitey was in trouble again , charged with selling government pistols , compasses , lamps and radios on the black market while in command of a station in Brazil . He got off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never at a loss for work , Pilot Dahl barnstormed around South America after the war until he landed a good spot with Swissair on the run from Geneva to Paris . That lasted until one night in 1953 , when Dahl was seen leaving his plane with a heavy package-and $35,000 in gold bullion was missing from the baggage hold . Whitey was found guilty , sentenced to two years in prison , but was freed pending appeal . <P> While waiting for the new hearing , Dahl went back to Canada and got a job with a Quebec bush airline , flying supplies to the Arctic radar sites . At Frobisher Bay on Baffin Island last week , the owner of a beat-up DC-3 propositioned him to ferry the plane with two passengers to the mainland . The aircraft had no operational radio equipment , but it was flyable-and bush pilots earn their extra dollars by taking risks . Dahl took the job and was only minutes away from his destination when the old bucket gave up the battle and went down in the Quebec wilderness . One man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent at last , was found dead at the controls .
