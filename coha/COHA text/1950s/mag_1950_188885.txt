Hollywood will wait until March to award its Oscars for the movies ' brightest achievements of 1949 , but last week critical kibitzers everywhere had loosed their own showers of laurels . Two of the weightiest forums reached major agreement on one picture : Italian Director Vittorio de Sica 's The Bicycle Thief won the National Board of Review 's blessing as the year 's best film , and the vote of the New York Film Critics as the best foreign-language movie . <P> **26;6827;TOOLONG Robert Ros-sen 's All the King 's Men won the New York critics ' award as 1949 's best English-language picture , but failed to appear on the National Board 's ten-best list . Except for The Bicycle Thief , only four films won recognition from both groups : Britain 's The Fallen Idol and Quartet , MGM 's Intruder in the Dust , and France 's Devil in the Flesh . <P> For the best performances , the Film Critics named Broderick Crawford in All the King 's Men and Olivia de Havilland ( for the second year in a row ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honors for direction went to Carol Reed 's staging of The Fallen Idol .
