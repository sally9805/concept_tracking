txt FOREST PARK , Pa. , June ** industry-financed fund , to protect 60,000 union garment workers in the New York metropolitan area if their employers go out of business is being sought ' by the Cloak Joint Board of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union , A. F. L. The union is asking no direct wage increase , because of slack conditions , but it has called upon the four associations representing New York manufacturers of women 's coats and suits to contribute 2 per cent of payrolls to a fund that would give workers a " nest egg " if their jobs vanished . The fund demand is part of a program for increasing stability in the industry and preventing the return of the old " auction block " system , under which employers succeeded at the expense of their workers . Old Contract Continued The employers contend that the union 's program is " full of indirect wage increases " and that it will stand in the way of industrial reforms necessary to strengthen the New York market against inroads by manufacturers in other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but have expressed willingness to extend all provisions of the old three-year contract for one year without change . The old contract expired at midnight Thursday , but it had been continued for ten days to permit further negotiations . The industry , once the center of union-management conflict , has not had a strike for twenty-five years . Both sides hope to maintain this record . The inability of the manufacturers and the union to work out a prompt accord cast no visible pall over the opening this week-end of Unity House , the union 's luxurious summer resort in the Pocono Mountains . It is the union 's custom to invite several hundred employers as guests of the workers at the opening . Heads of the cloak association , all of whom were invited a month ago , were among the employers here today . David Dubinsky , union president , and the employers agreed that // there would be no discussion of the contract controversy until they retithed to New York Monday . pin rummy , dancing , boating and exchange of reminiscences about UM turbulent early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employer guests . The union 's call for a job-terminption fund would cost the empoyers about $2,500,000 a year . As outlined by Israel Feinberg , manager of the cloak board , the demands would give workers payments equal to one week 's wages for each year of employment if their employers quit business . Fixing of Rates Sought " We have had situations , " Mr. Feinberg said , " in which employers have accumulated comfortable fortunes over the years . At the first sign that business is going to be bad , they cease to operate . Workers are thrown out and it takes them weeks or months to find another job . It is no more than fair to remedy this through the establishment of an industry-wide fund . " The union also is seeking a 2 per cent increase in its welfare fund to finance disability benefits . This would add another $2,500,000 to a fund that now takes 6% per cent of payrolls from all cloak employers . The fund provides retirement , health and vacation benefits .

It also wants the minimum wage rates in the contract revised to reflect cost-of-living increases received by the workers in the war and postwar years . ? Operators , who are currently receiving $87 a week , have a contract minimum of $55 , Mr. Feinberg said . Finishers , earning $78 a week , are listed in the contract to receive $46 , Louis Dubow , managing director of the Merchants Ladies Garment Association , said the employers had " no money " to increase labor costs this year . He maintained that the union program was inconsistent with Mr. Dubinsky 's announcement last week that the union would seek no increases until business improved . Mr. Dubow said little could be done to solve the problems of New York manufacturers unless the union would permit a thorough overhaul of the old contract to give specific recognition to the socalled section work system of operation . This system makes greater use of mass production techniques than the old hand tailoring method . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , " Mr. Dubow said . " It has obliged us to live under an antiquated contract and philosophy that is responsible for the decline of the New York market . The only way we can get business back to New York is by making it profitable to do business in New York . That does not involve cutting wages or exploiting the workers . It is simply a matter of applying reasonable rules and not hampering us with constant demands for increases in one guise or another . " The union got a $5 increase under an arbitration award last No vember.
