On a windswept field near Bolivia 's big Catavi tin mine , President Victor Paz Estenssoro stepped to a rude table one day last week and with a golden pen signed the decree nationalizing the country 's three big tin companies . Twenty thousand black-shawled women and tin-helmeted men yelled vivas . A leather-jacketed Indian stepped to the President 's side and sounded the ancient Inca battle call on a curved bull horn . That night bonfires burned all over the Bolivian Andes , and the cobbled streets of La Paz echoed with the din of jubilant partisans firing off the rifles and pistols they had seized from government arsenals and routed army units last April during the uprising of Paz Estenssoro 's totalitarian Movement of National Revolution . <P> Time to Explain . The tin decree , climaxing long years of bloody struggle , was the most important act of nationalization in Latin America since Mexico expropriated its foreign oil companies in 1938 . The three nationalized companies-Patino , * Hochschild , Aramayo-produce 72% of the country 's tin . Though Bolivia now mines only 15% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that is produced in the Western Hemisphere . And tin is still backward Bolivia 's one cash crop , providing 80% of the country 's foreign exchange . Last week 's decree set a tentative valuation on the expropriated properties of $21,750,000-barely a third of what the companies think their investments in Bolivia are worth . <P> Nevertheless , President Paz Estenssoro hopes to make a peaceful settlement with the big three . He has insisted that " lawful compensation must be paid . " On the eve of nationalization , the companies received what appeared to be a demand for $505
