As we have often told you , TIME is in the international publishing busi ness , with four International editions which carry the news of the world and the advertisements of free enterprise to our readers over seas . These editions print the same news as the U.S. edition , of course - but they print different advertisements . Consequently , while you often see the mes sages of foreign busi nesses in our U.S. edition , you do not see the advertisements of U.S. business which run in our International editions . <P> Recently , Roy E. Larsen , President of TIME Inc. , was quoted in this connection in a booklet we published about advertising . Said Mr. Larsen : " Our magazines are dedicated to " the distribution of informa tion - and this applies to their advertising as well as to their editorial pages . Just as the work of our world could not go on without the swift ex change of news - so would our economy , grind to a halt without the swift exchange of goods and news about those goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those in other U.S. publications distributed overseas , constitute a major medium for the ex change across our borders of news about goods and their sources . Naturally , the advertisers are conducting their businesses to make money , but in the process many of them are selling the New World to the Old . <P> Their advertisements are often quite different from the ones you find in our U.S. edition . Many of them ( and there were 2,792 pages of them in our four International editions last year ) are directed towards supplying the needs of war-torn or economically undeveloped areas , and almost always they offer their wares by selling the con cept as hard as the product . They sell insecticides , antibiotics and pharmaceutical products , for instance , by selling American standards of health ; they sell trucks , petroleum products , road-building equipment and automotive replacement parts by selling American standards of transportation ; they sell agricultural equipment by selling American standards of food productivity ; they sell office equipment and engineering services by selling American standards of efficiency . <P> As one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages are milestones on the road to progress ; they tell us much of the American way of life . " <P> And not long ago , with an even larger focus , one of our European readers had this to say about TIME International : <P> " You have really succeeded in making American democracy an article of export . <P> TIME is a link , not only between reader and world news , but also between a wide spiritual community of people feeling the same way . " <P> * * * Of course , to stay in business , all these advertisers in TIME 'S International editions must sell their products or services . <P> A case in point is one American manufacturer who has been an advertiser in the International editions since 1941 . He told us that his company had received an inquiry from a major Government official of Pakistan early in 1949 concerning one of his advertisements in TIME . <P> Recently , he wrote to say that he had closed an order for $800,000 worth of hydroelectric equipment . He had been selling American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cordially yours ,
