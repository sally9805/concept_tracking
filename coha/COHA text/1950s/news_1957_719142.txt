txt ALEXANDRIA , Va. , Sept. 14 ? A Federal court ordered Arlington County , Va. , today to begin racial integration of its public schools a week from Monday . Albert V. Bryan , United States District judge , granted a motion for the early admission of seven Negro children to formerly all-white schools . He rejected an appeal for delay by J. Lindsay Almond Jr. , the state 's Attorney General and Democratic candidate for Governor . Admission of the seven children will mark the first break in Virginia 's " massive resistance " to the Supreme Court 's decision that racial segregation in public schools is unconstitutional . This resistance has been directed by Senator Harry F. Byrd , leader of the dominant Democratic state machine . Further delay at this point would be possible only if some court should grant a stay of today 's order while it was appealed . But the judge 's language in an accompanying memorandum suggested that a stay might be difficult to obtain . If the children do enter as ordered on Sept. 23 , there may he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last May // automatically would cut off state school aid funds for any county in which even one school was racially integrated . Such a cut-off would throw a burden on local taxpayers and undoubtedly provoke resentment against the Democratic state govern-ment , The likely political beneficiary , then , would be Mr. Almond 's Republican opponent , Ted Dalton . Mr. Dalton has told his campaign audiences that Mr. Byrd 's " massive resistance " program will collapse and bring " massive integration . " Mr. Dalton is , however , an underdog in the gubernatorial race . Judge Bryan 's decision today dealt primarily with a pupil placement act also adopted by the Legislature last . year in an effort to circumvent the Supreme Court ruling . It took away from all local school boards the power to assign pupils to schools and gave the authority to a three-man board in Richmond . Only one of the seven Negro pupils involved in the present case had filled out the form required by the pupil placement board . The Virginia authorities argued mainly that the students had not exhausted their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief . Judge Bryan ruled that the Negro children need not comply with the pupil placement act or fill out the required forms . ' Too Sluggish and Prolix ' " The procedure there prescribed is too sluggish and prolix to constitute a reasonable remedial process , " he wrote . He said the court could not " fairly require the plaintiffs even to submit their applications to the board for school assignment . " Judge Bryan noted that the form committed persons signing it to accept a school " which the hoard deems most appropriate in accordance with " the pupil placement act . He said signing this " amounts almost to assent to a racially segregated school . " The judge reviewed the evidence in the seven cases and concluded that all the children had applied on the opening day of school , Sept. 5 , to be admitted to the Arlington public school nearest their homes . Each school had been all white . The Negro schools were many miles farther from the children 's homes . Judge Bryan asserted that refusal to admit the seven children " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His order directed admission of the seven to the schools at which they had applied . The judge , who held two days of hearings on the case , said that his order would affect school attendance " very slightly . " " Into a white school-population of 21,215 only seven Negro children will enter ; one Negro will he with 11,421 white children in the elementary grades ; and no more than six Negroes among , the 9,821 white high school students , " he , said . " Of thirty-six previously allwhite schools in the county , four will he affected by the d-cree , and then not to a greater extent than two Negroes in any one of the four schools . " In holding the procedures of the Pupil Placement Art an unreasonable administrative remedy , Judge Bryan followed a decision handed down last July 13 by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit . The appellate court 's ruling came on suits brought originally in Newport News and Norfolk , Va .
