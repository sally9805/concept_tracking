Vacationing in the Caribbean , TIME Associate Editor George G. Daniels spent three days in the Dominican Republic , where Dictator Rafael Leonidas Trujillo is tensely on guard against any attack by Caribbean revolutionaries . His report : <P> No one batted an eye when I presented my tourist card with its " Occupation : Journalist . " They quietly took my picture , checked me electronically for weapons , secretly searched my belongings , fastened a couple of plainclothes cops to me like leeches , and turned me loose . <P> What I saw was the bristling little dictatorship of Generalissimo Trujillo . The Dominicans brag that they have 25,000 men under arms , an air force of 50 jets , and a navy of 19 frigate-destroyer escort-type vessels , all highly efficient . The troops looked neat and tough . Drive west from the center of Ciudad Trujillo , and you come on huge fields with possibly 2,000 to 3,000 men drilling in squad-sized groups . These are the draftees , and their D.I.s strut and chant like U.S. marines , all very sharp . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand-new jet base at San Isidro , about 15 miles from Ciudad Trujillo , with what looked like 8,000-9,000-ft. run , ways and high-speed taxi strips . What is more , Trujillo 's navy actually sails-one or two of the frigates were constantly on the horizon while I was there . <P> In Lock Step . The city they like to show visitors looks something like the better residential sections of Palm Beach , Fla . The ten-minute drive from the airport takes the visitor past block after block of modern houses that range from $50,000 on up to $200,000 . This one belongs to Trujillo 's son , that one to his daughter . Brother Hector , the nominal <P> President , lives here ; this is one of the Chief 's houses ; his uncle owns this one , aunt that one . Out in the country there are magnificent ranches owned by the Chief , a handsome estate with a small French chateau owned by one of his daughters . <P> Trujillo 's country home near San Cristobal , 20 miles west in the foothills , is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went up there with my two policemen buddies , and a soldier dogged me so closely it looked as if we were in lock step . The house itself is an immense pile of plate glass and yellowish-brown stone , with galleries running all around . On the next hilltop was a huge neon sign about 50 ft. by 20 ft. that flashes at night , " telling people , " my buddies said , " of all Trujillo 's good works . " <P> Painted Slums . What the Dominicans do not like to talk about is the poverty . They show visitors the new housing project across the river from Ciudad Trujillo , but it is very small potatoes compared with the slums that make up the bulk of the city . The hovels are all freshly painted , generally an ocher or a sky blue or sea green , with a barn-red trim framing the doors and windows . That 's the way El Benefactor wants it , and everybody paints once or twice a year . But the houses themselves are miserable one-or two-room shacks , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The children are naked and dirty , the women haggard , and much of the cooking is done on the sidewalk over charcoal braziers-rice , fried bananas , very little meat .
