Picked by President Eisenhower to head the cluttered , musty Federal Trade Commission in 1953 , Washington Lawyer Edward F. Howrey immediately set about using a stiff new broom . He brought back FTC as the umpire of U.S. business practices , cleared up a mammoth backlog of antitrust and unfair-practice cases . Last week , when he resigned , Chairman Howrey was able to tell the President : " The Commission has been reorganized from top to bottom . Its docket is up-to-date for the first time in almost 40 years . Its policies have been reoriented to the original intent of Congress . " <P> To succeed Republican Howrey as chairman , the White House picked FTCommissioner J. W. Gwynne , 65 , who , like Howrey , grew up in Waterloo , Iowa and was appointed to the agency in 1953 . A conservative , hard-plugging lawyer and onetime judge who represented Iowa 's Third District in Congress for 14 years ( until 1948 ) , Republican Gwynne worked closely with Howrey , is expected to keep FTC on its present course . <P> Howrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norwegian-born Sigurd Anderson , 51 , who stepped out after two terms as South Dakota governor last January . Next month there will be another new face on the FTC : Democrat William C. Kern , 52-year-old Indianapolis lawyer and son of the late Senator John W. Kern , Democratic vice-presidential candidate in 1908 ) . Kern , now assistant director of FTC 's Bureau of Litigation , will succeed 69-year-old Commissioner James Mead , former New York Senator , whose six-year term is expiring . <P> When the new appointees take office , the Commission will take on a brand new characteristic : for the first time in its 40 years , it will be composed entirely of Midwesterners.
