" 434COMFORT GOODPASTURE sat at the desk in her father 's study with her homework in front of her . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fast-rising bosom . Occasionally one of her male colleagues at Webster High School , made recklessby desire , would undertake to lay hands on those haunches or that bosom . For his pains he would receive a clout that sometimes required stitches . Comfort , no matter how she jiggled and jutted , was still unawakened . She opened her textbook in geometry , found a clean sheet of paper , uncapped her pen , furrowed her alabaster brow , and began to write . " Dear Elvis , " she wrote . " Well , I suppose you are wondering what happened at the last meeting . Elvis , it was the most ! Betty Ann Steinberg had this absolute gasser of an idea . Instead of playing the whole album like we always do , we only played one song  --  Hound Dog , of course . We played it 38 times and I 'm here to tell44you everybody went ape !

This girl Gloria Coleman was at the meeting . I never wrote you about her before because this is the first meeting she ever came to . She has n't been a bit well . She ran into this lobster pot when she was water skiing last summer , and she had to have bone grafts and everything . She 's all right now , but she sure is a changed person . I mean , before her tragedy she was always hacking around and yocking up a storm , but now she 's very quiet and spiritual if you know what I mean . Well , anyhow , she said she wrote this poem which she wanted to read . Of course , everybody groaned and pretended they were shutting their ears , but she read it anyhow and , Elvis , I 'm here to tell you when she finished , there was n't a dry eye in the house . So we passed a resolution for me to send you the poem which hereinafter follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonely on a cloud , And I said , What are you doing ? ' And he said , I watch the crowd .

' Well , Elvis , I know how you must feel after reading this , so I will close now . The girl who wrote the 45poem 's name is Gloria Coleman , and it would be very nice if your agent could send her a little note or something , because when a person has had bone grafts they can always use a little cheering up . I will write you again after our next meeting , and meanwhile the girls all join in wishing you many more golden platters , and may the Big Fellow in the Sky continue to watch over you and your meteoric career . Your Fan , Comfort Goodpasture " She addressed the letter , put it away , and turned with a martyr 's groan to her geometry book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding a corn- manding lead , the uneven match was interrupted by the entrance of her father . " Hi , Daddy-O , " she said , looking up at him in an unfrightened manner . Comfort was not intimidated by Isaac Goodpas- ture , but there were plenty who were . Isaac was a long , dark , craggy Yankee with eyebrows like hang- ing gardens . He had an abrasive wit and a place to exercise it : he was editor and owner of the Putnam 's Landing Gazette , a weekly newspaper which had belonged to his family since 1834 . Isaac and Comfort lived in a tiny , tidy pre-Rev- olutionary clapboard house , located unfashionably near the center of town . There were just the two of them . Comfort , an only child , had been left mother- less when she was twelve , and it had fallen to Isaac to guide her through puberty . He had , in his opin- ion , done a reasonably good job . True , her speech was an execrable mishmash of teen-age patois , and 46the clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks in school took no prizes , and she thought Elvis Presley shaded Abe Lincoln as the greatest American of all time  --  but , on the other hand , he had successfully kept her out of the white slave trade . And that , in this rock-and-roll era , he regarded as no minor achievement . He stood now in his study and looked down at Comfort , incongruously pink and voluptuous behind his austere Early American desk . " Good evening , Comfort , " he said . " Daddy-O , " she said , pointing at her geometry text , " I do n't dig this Pythagoras cat . " " Try a little harder , " said he . " But try up in your own room , will you please ? I need the study . Some people are coming in . " " All rootie , " she said agreeably . She picked up her book and papers and , humming the largo from Hound Dog , she started out of the study . " Comfort ! " he called sharply . " Yeah ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like what ? " " Like that ! " " But , Daddy-O , that 's the way I walk , " she said innocently . " Nobody walks that way , " he declared . " Or , at least , nobody did before Marilyn Monroe invented it . " Gee , I ca n't help the way I walk . " " Yes , you can  --  and , as a matter of public safety , you better had , " he said grimly. 47RALLY ROUNDComfort broke into a delighted giggle . She came back to Isaac and planted an affectionate kiss on his cheek . " Daddy-O , " she said , " you 're square as a bear , but I dig you the most . " " I appreciate that , " he said drily . " Now get upstairs and do your homework . . . And do it right . One more report card like the last one , and I 'm puttingyou to work in the steam laundry . " " Har-de-har-har , " said Comfort , vastly amused . " This is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start tending to business and stop running around with those hot-rod Romeos . What in the world do you do with those boys anyhow ? " " I cope , " she replied . " Successfully , one hopes ? " " Are you kiddin ' ? " she snorted derisively . " Why , those little twerps at Webster  --  I can handle ' em with my pinkie ! " " For this relief much thanks , " he murmured . She giggled again . " You stone me , " she said fondly . " I mean you drive me ape . " She gave him another kiss and went to her room . Isaac watched pensively as she ascended the stairs . " If she gets any rounder , " he thought , " I will have to post guards . " Nature had been more than normally whimsical to give a daughter like Comfort to Isaac . He was everything she was not  --  bony , dry , tough , unfrivolous . He had only one passion  --  the preservation of the status quo . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change of48THE FLAG , BOYS ! any kind . Each week , as the Yankees nodded approvaland the commuters had conniption fits , he wielded his editorial axe against new schools , new roads , new sewers , new parks , and other such , as he had once called them , " toboggans into the murky valley of deficit financing . " Now , as Comfort sat upstairs making feckless lunges at Pythagoras , Isaac , in his study , broke out a bottle of blended whisky and a box of dime cigars . A few visitors were coming to help him shore up the status quo . Tonight was town meeting night in Putnam 's Landing , and Isaac was holding his usual small caucus at home before the meeting . The town meetings of New England , Isaac would agree in principle , were an excellent thing . Every voter could attend , could rise and be heard , could cast his ballot . It was democracy in the grand old Yankee tradition . But  --  and here , for Isaac , was the heart of the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yankees . Or , at any rate , only for adherents to the Yankee financial philosophy . Isaac had no prejudicesof a religious or racial nature . When , for example , the Italians moved into Putnam 's Landing and he saw that underneath their swarthy volatility they had a healthy respect for the dollar , both privateand public , Isaac was well pleased to have them . But the commuters were something else again . In this instance , too , he had no objections on grounds of prejudice ; it made no difference that so many of them were Jews , copy-writers , Barnard alumnae , vodka drinkers , dextrose eaters , Kafka49RALLY ROUNDreaders , Democrats , and other such exotics . But what he found utterly and totally unconscionable was that these people earned an average of ten to twenty thousand dollars a year and failed to live on it ! And , instead of decently hiding their shame at home , they came pouring into the town meeting each month to make fervent speeches for more schools , more parks , more traffic lights , more everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes ! It was to save Putnam 's Landing from these fiscal idiots that Isaac held his caucus before every town meeting . He called together a few prominent citizens , Yankees all , men of his own sober political persuasion , and together they laid plans to meet the menace of the commuters . The members of the caucus arrived promptly at eight . They took seats in the study , accepted White Owls and iX ounce shots of Three Feathers . ( In point of fact , two of them did not smoke or drink , but as a matter of principle they never turned down anything free . ) There were five of them in all . Readingfrom left to right , they were , first , George Melvin , a rosy , plausible real estate dealer who had gotten rich selling housing sites to commuters . George 's success was largely attributable to one fact : he had mastered the art of nomenclature . When , for instance , he bought the swamp behind the old Penniman place , he named it " Powderhorn Hill " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of salt meadow south of the tracks were re-chris-50THE FLAG , BOYS ! tened " Flintlock Ridge " and sold with equal dispatch . Perhaps his boldest stroke was " Upper Meadow "  --  formerly a gravel pit . No pangs of conscience disturbed George 's peace . Maybe his customers ' cellars did leak a bit , but , by golly , when a fellow has been living , say , on 68th Street , it sure made him feel mighty proud when he could call his friends and say , " How 'd you like to run up to Flintlock Ridge this weekend ? " Next was Waldo Pike , a direct beneficiary of the leaky cellars spawned by George Melvin . Waldo owned the local hardware store and did a booming business in wall sealers . And when , after hideous expense , the cellars were finally snug and dry , Waldo promptly persuaded the homesteaders to fill them with work benches , power saws , jigs , lathes , drills , sanders , and a huge , gleaming variety of tools . This took no great persuasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was queer for tools . After dealing exclusively with abstractions from Monday to Friday at CBS , BBD &O,; or Doubleday , he felt a frantic compulsion to restore the balance by working with his hands on weekends . Which redounded directly to the enrichment of the third member of Isaac 's caucus , Dr. Emmett Magruder , who could always count on a brisk trade with needle and suture on Saturdays and Sundays . And , to his great surprise , he was busy all the rest of the week too . Doc , now nearing seventy , had receivedhis M.D. from a Boston diploma mill in 1909 and had successfully avoided learning any medicine since . The Yankees of Putnam 's Landing knew the51RALLY ROUNDextent of Doc 's training and never troubled him with anything a talented Boy Scout could not fix . But the commuters flocked to his office in droves . After New York with its high-pressure doctors and their high-gloss equipment , they found it downrightrefreshing to come to a twinkly old man in a tacky old office with a battered old desk and a creaky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was  --  good ; simple ; American ! They were further gratified to learn that Doc was not given to glib diagnoses . Unlike his arrogant Manhattan colleagueswho would never admit themselves at a loss , Doc would more often than not make a frank , cheerful confession that he had n't a clue as to what ailed them , but whatever it was , it would probably go away . " What a fine , honest old gent ! " they would say about him later , those who lived . The fourth member of the caucus was Minton Evans , landscaper , from whom never was heard a discouraging word . Was Minton called to make a lawn where the soil was too sandy ? Too silty ? Too sour ? Did the land lie in the path of every spring freshet ? Was the sun blocked off from seven a.m. to nightfall ? Were the moles holding a track meet underneath ? Was the forest nibbling on the edges ? ... Well , never mind . Minton would do the job , no matter how much muscle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job had to be done again , Minton was available again . And again . And again . " One good thing about Minton , " the commuters told each other . " You can always get him . " Manning Thaw completed the caucus . Manning52THE FLAG , BOYS ! was the first selectman of Putnam 's Landing . The office was equivalent to mayor , and , in fact , Manninghad long wanted the name changed officially to mayor . But George Melvin , the expert on nomenclature , had argued strenuously that " first selectman " had just the kind of quaint , cottage-cheesy quality that kept New Yorkers moving to Putnam 's Landing , and so the name was retained . Manning was a drab , sallow little man , sixty years old and precisely five feet tall . He was about as unlike a politician as a politician can be . He shook no hands , clapped no backs , kissed no babies , granted no interview , made no public speeches . No private speeches either ; he was as thrifty with words as with money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's salary of $4200 a year , he supported himself , kept an aged mother in St. Petersburg , operateda 1951 Chevrolet , gave a tithe to the CongregationalChurch , paid his taxes , and bought three shares of AT &T; each year . He was a bachelor and lived in a furnished room over Da Costa 's drug store . His objets d'art were two  --  a framed sampler over his bed which said : MAKE IT DO , WEAR IT OUT , USE IT UP , DO WITHOUT. and a framed sampler over his desk at Town Hall which said the same thing . Isaac Goodpasture , having fulfilled his obliga-53RALLY ROUNDtions as host , capped the Three Feathers , closed the White Owls , and began the business of the evening . " Boys , " he said to all assembled , " we 've had some tough town meetings before , but tonight 's is going to be a bitch-kitty . First of all , that demented O'Sheel woman is coming in with a recommendation for a garbage disposal plant . She says we ca n't keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why the hell not ? " demanded Minton Evans , the landscaper , who sold the town five yards of gravel each day to cover the garbage . " Why , it 's a wonderful system , " declared George Melvin , the real estate dealer , who had an option to buy Haskins Hollow once it was filled and covered . " And very sanitary , " added Doc Magruder , who had three inbred cousins , otherwise unemployable , who were now on salary as custodians of the dump . " You do n't have to convince me , " said Isaac . " I do n't want to throw away a half million dollars on a garbage disposal plant . But the O'Sheel woman is coming in loaded for bear this time . She 's got some brand-new gimmick , and she 's also got a lot of people on her side . We better think of something . " Manning Thaw had been silent to this moment . Now he said two words : " Forget it . " They all turned and looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Manning , I tell you she might have the votes to push it through . " " Forget it , " repeated Manning . Isaac looked at him narrowly . " Manning , do you54THE FLAG , BOYS ! know something we do n't ? " " Yup , " said Manning . " You going to tell us ? " " Noe . " " Why not ? " " ' Cause it 's a long story , and I got to tell it at the town meetin ' . No sense tellin ' it twice . " " I see . But we 're not to worry about the garbage disposal plant ? " Isaac pressed him . " Nope . " " All right , " said Isaac . " If you say so . . . Now here 's item number two : another wild woman with a mission . Laura Beauchamp wants the town to sponsor a folk-drama on the Fourth of July . " " What in tarnation is a folk-drama ? " asked Doc . " Nothing small , " Isaac replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have a cast of a hundred people . " " Doing what ? " asked Minton . " Re-enacting the landing of the British on Ram 's Head Beach in 1778 , " said Isaac . " And , believe me , the original British landing was a good deal cheaper . She 's asking for fifty Redcoat uniforms , fifty Minutemencostumes , a hundred muskets , a hundred sabres , three longboats , two field pieces , and God knows what else will pop into her feeble mind ! " " Forget it , " said Manning . " This too ? " asked Isaac . " YupIsaac gave him a close scrutiny . " You 're sure ? " " Yu " p  --  " Positive ? " asked Isaac. 55RALLY ROUND " I said , did n't I ? " snapped Manning . Isaac shrugged . " All right , Manning . On to the next item . Still another one of our busy young matrons  --  GraceBannerman  --  is making a motion to reinstatethat teacher who taught the second grade how to copulate . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Every so-called enlightened housewife in town , " Isaac answered . " They 've been ringing doorbells , writing leaflets , passing petitions , making speeches , all week long . " " Forget it , " said Manning . " All right , Manning , " said Isaac firmly . " What 's this big secret of yours ? " The others crowded around the first selectman . " Yeah , Manning , what 's up ? " " What 's been going on ? " " What makes you so cocky ? " Manning rose . " Possess your souls in patience , " he said primly . " Come on , time to go to meetin ' . " He started out with the others close behind him , wagging their heads in bewilderment . As they passed the staircase , Isaac stopped suddenly . " Go ahead , boys , " he said to his cohorts . " I 'll meet you outside . " When they had gone , Isaac shouted up the stairs : " Comfort ! " " Yes , Daddy-O ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That ought to be yells . " " Do your homework , do you hear ? " 56THE FLAG , BOYS ! " Yes , Daddy-O . " " And do n't go running around . ' " I dig you , Daddy-O . " " Goodnight . " " Crazy , man ! " Wincing , Isaac went out to join his friends . The square on the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the gizmo on the rillera of my blue suede shoes , " said Comfort and flung her geometry text peevishly into a corner . " Dullsville , " said Comfort , lying on her back and regarding her toes . Everything dullsville . Geometry . Town meetings . Her dad . Her toes . Everything . Suddenly from beneath her window there came a roar of dual exhausts , a screech of brakes , the blast of a Klaxon . " Oh , no ! " she groaned . " Not him again ! " She looked out the window . At the curb behind the wheel of a make-it-yourself automobile sat Grady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( The term " juvenile delinquent " is here used loosely . Grady was not the lean , hard , Sal Mineo type . He was more on the well-fed , spongy side . The tenement that spawned him was a $40,000 ranch house on two well-kept acres , and the sight of a switchblade would have put him in shock . Grady was a member of the new school of juvenile delinquency , the You-Too-Can-Be-A-Rebel School . The headmasters were Elvis Presley and the spook of Jimmy Dean , and the entrance requirementswere completely democratic . A boy was no longer excluded from the glamorous ranks of the57RALLY ROUNDdelinquents simply because he had had the rotten luck not to be born in a slum ; all he had to do was look as though he had . If he would wear his hair in a duck-tail cut and his sideburns at nostril level , forsake grammar , dress in black khaki trousers with the cuffs narrowed to fourteen inches , never do his homework , and spit a lot , his origins , no matter how respectable , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " said Comfort , leaning out her window . Of all the gropers at Webster High , this one was far and away the stickiest . Only last week she had given him a fat ear , and here he was again ! " Go away ! " she repeated . Unheeding , Grady stepped out of his hot-rod . He took out a cigarette , struck a kitchen match on his thumbnail , lit the cigarette , tilted his pelvis , half-lowered his eyelids , hooked his thumbs in his wide , studded belt , and expressed some saliva . " Whaddya say , hey ? " he said to Comfort . " Let 's do some truism ' . " " I 've got homework , " she said . " Homework 's for squares . Come on , we 'll have a few chuckles . " " Chuckles with you ? " she hooted . " Oh , flake off , little man ! " " You 're fighting me , " he said reproachfully . " You are a ninety-handed idiot , " said Comfort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , you do n't , " he said positively . " I figured it out , see ? I drive you ape , and you just do n't trust yourself with me , that 's what it is . " " Har-  --  de-har-har ! " replied Comfort. 58THE FLAG , BOYS ! " And I 'll tell you somethin ' else , " he continued . " In exactly three months , you and I are gon na be goin ' steady . " " Man , what are you smoking ? " " It 's a fact , hey . No doubt about it . Because in exactly three months , I 'm gettin ' somethin ' that 's got ta swing it . " " Plastic surgery ? " asked Comfort . " A motorcycle , " said Grady . " Hm ! " said she thoughtfully . This did put rather a new aspect on the situation . " Why do you have to wait three months ? " she asked . " ' Cause it 'll be my eighteenth birthday , and the fossils promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then you 're dead , " she said flatly . " I 've been knocking myself out all night with this Pythagoras cat , and I 'm nowhere . " " Maybe if we kind of helped each other ? " suggestedGrady . " Well , maybe , " she allowed . " Come on in . " " No , you come out . We can cruise while we 're studyin '  --  maybe get a hamburger or like that . " Comfort sighed . So it was to be another evening of groping . . . Oh , well , what did it matter ? She 'd have no trouble handling this busy little man , and anything was better than laying around this dullsvillehouse all by herself . " I 'll be right down , " she said. 595SOME said it was metal fatigue , some said it was electrical failure , and some said it was plain oldfashionedpilot error . But all anybody knew for sure was that in four widely separated areas of the world  --  Utah , West Germany , Okinawa , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had crashed within a single week . The Air Force began an immediate investigation . Pending the results , orders went out grounding all C-124s everywhere . One C-124 , bound from Mitchel Field to Fairbanks , Alaska , was actually in the air when the grounding orders came through . The pilot made a 18o degree turn , headed back to Mitchel , landed , taxied to the hangar , and out came a passengernamed Guido di Maggio , smiling the profoundsmile of the reprieved . " It 's the hand of God ! " cried Guido thirty minutes later as he rushed into the office of Major Albert R. McEstway , post adjutant at Fort Totten. 60RALLY ROUND THE FLAG , BOYS ! " It 's what I keep telling you : I am not meant to go to Alaska . Sir , if you send me now , you 're flying in the face of Providence ! " " I 'll risk it , " said the Major . " Sir , look at me , " said Guido earnestly . " Have I got a pleasing personality ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are all of those , " allowed the Major , " and persevering into the bargain . " " Right ! So why do n't you send me to New York ? Boston ? Washington ? Are you going to waste officer material like me on the frozen tundra ? " " That I am , " said the Major comfortably . " Sir --  " " There will be another plane any day now , and you will be on it . " " Sir --  " " Goodnight , Lieutenant . " " Okay , I 'll leave , " pouted Guido . " But do n't expecta salute . " He left the adjutant and went to the nearest phone booth . He called Maggie Larkin in Putnam 's Landing . This was a rite he had been performing twice daily since his arrival at Fort Totten , and always with the same outcome ; when Maggie heard his voice , she slammed down the phone . Tonight , however , the result was different : as Maggie was out baby-sitting at the Bannermans ' , Guido got no answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Officers Club . Seething with frustration and rage , he stormed into the bar-room . It was deserted61RALLY ROUND except for the bartender and a solitary captain , hunched over a highball at the end of the bar . Guido had never laid eyes on the Captain before ; nonetheless , he strode directly over to him and said , without preliminary , " Let 's get one thing straight , Captain . I 'm in no mood for any conversation to- night . Okay ? " " Suits me , " said the Captain , regarding Guido incuriously . The Captain was a large , muscular man of forty . His chest was decorated with three banks of combat ribbons of Korea and World War II . His hair was cropped , his neck was thick , his jaw was strong , his eyes were pale blue and glittered like two bits of ice . " No offense , see ? " said Guido , his tone softening a little .

The Captain sat motionless over his drink for a moment , then turned back to Guido . " I 'm Walker Hoxie , " he said . Guido extended his hand . Walter Hoxie consid- ered it briefly , then decided to shake it . This done , he turned back to his drink . " You 're new here , are n't you ? " asked Guido . Walker Hoxie sighed . He turned back to Guido . " Lieutenant , " he said softly , " I 'm glad you do n't want any conversation tonight , because I do n't want any either . " " Well , that simplifies things , does n't it ? " said Guido , flashing Walker Hoxie a winsome smile . No 62 smile was forthcoming in return . Guido looked at Walker Hoxie 's flat , hard face , his corded beck , his bulging sleeves , his big , blunt hands , his battle ribbons . Guido felt a small chill . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stool at the other end of the bar . He ordered a rye and ginger ale . As he drank , he stole a glance at Walker Hoxie , sitting motionless over his glass , his head down , his shoulders sloping inward , looking as hard and sharp and lethal as a projectile . Guido suppressed a shudder . " Boy , " he said to himself , " there is one guy I am never going to get mixed up with ! " Somebody Up There chuckled. 6THE four clocks on the wall of Oscar Hoffa 's office said , respectively , 7:01 , 6:oi , 5:01 , and 4:01 , indicating the time in the Eastern , Central , Mountain , and Pacific zones , and indicating also that Oscar was a television executive of the first magnitude . Lesser executives had to get along with only one clock ; it is said , in fact , that on poorer networks , they sometimes had to share a clock between two of them . Ignoring all four clocks , Oscar shot back his cuff , looked at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instantly a thirty-one inch television screen on the wall across from him flickered into life . A rocket ship whooshed across the screen . The sparks from the exhaust arranged themselves into flaming letters that spelled : THE ADVENTURES OF CRUNCH CRANDALL  --  SPACEMAN ! Never taking his eyes off the screen , Oscar snatched open the lid of a mahogany cigar box. 64RALLY ROUND THE FLAG , BOYS ! His hand swooped in , seized an Upmann Monarch like an eagle seizing a lamb , carried it to his mouth . His teeth closed like a trap , ripping a ragged inch off the end of the cigar . He spat it on the Baluchistanrug . He ran a kitchen match over the blond leather top of his desk , raised the flame to his cigar , puffed furiously , shook the match out , flipped it on the rug . Oscar was a bow-legged , barrel-chested man with a skin head , gimlet eyes , bushy nostrils , oversize mouth , and a thirty dollar suit , purplish-brown in color , with the breast pocket full of mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started his television career roundaboutly at the age of sixteen when he was hired as a skullcrackerby the circulation department of a New York tabloid .

Then he went to another radio station , and another , and then to television , spiralling ever upward , and now he was a four-clock executive sitting with an Upmann cigar and watching Crunch Crandall , Spaceman , save the fair Skarlotta , a Martianlass , from the foul clutches of " It , " the nameless monster of Ursa Minor . Oscar watched intently until the show was over . Then he snatched up the speaker of his dictaphone . " Memo to sales , " he barked . " Main title runs too long . Cut ten seconds and sell it to Philip Morris ... Memo to costume : More cleavage on Skarlotta. 65RALLY ROUNDLet 's see those knockers . . . Memo to casting .

" The door opened and admitted Mr. Hemming , who would have been very angry at having to wait two hours in the outer office , but he was an agent and could not , therefore , afford to get angry . " Good evening , Mr. Hoffa , " he said , smiling whitely . " What 's on your mind ? " asked Oscar , not rising . " As you know , " said Mr. Hemming , " I represent Lanier Mott , who , I believe I may say without fear of contradiction , is one of our truly great writers .

" Now what the hell ? " he asked angrily . " Mr. Wexler calling from production center , " said his secretary . Growling with exasperation , Oscar picked up the phone . " Yeah ? " he snapped . " Yeah . . . Yeah . . . No .. No ! . . . No , goddamit , you can not put the Mayflowerin the tank ; Esther Williams is in there ! " He slammed down the phone and returned to Mr. Hemming .

My client has instructed me that there is to be no deal unless he retains strict control over the commercial announcements . " " In your hat ! " replied Oscar promptly . " You get no control over the commercials . We 're in business for one reason  --  and it 's not to entertain or enlighten or enrich or educate . It 's to sell  --  and , buddy , nobodytells us how or when . " " My client does n't mean to be unreasonable , " said Mr. Hemming placatingly .

" 69RALLY ROUNDAngela Hoffa hang  --  = her mink telephone and muttered a blue word . She walked over to the bar , poured herself a shot glass full of White Label , and tossed it off . hen she sat down , unclenched her fists , and with a conscious effort of will , forced the anger to subside within her . " You get mad , youget lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andli around the mouth , I got enough . " There were , it is true , a few lines around her mouth and also some vague crow 's feet at the eyes , but nothing that would not yield to Max FactortAt 38 , Angela was a tall , white-skinned , black-haired , ripe beauty . A bit of the bounce had gone out of the pectorals , and there was an extra handful around the hips , but she could still count on a gratifying response when she appeared on Ram 's Head Beach in the summer . But it was not summer ; it was winter . And she was not on the beach being ogled ; she was at home being stupefied by boredom . Out of the last thirty nights , Oscar had been home exactly six ; the rest of the time he had been away swelling the unemploymentrolls in Los Angeles , Chicago , and New York . And even when he was home , he was not exactly what you would call company . An evening with Oscar was seven straight hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new belt for the dictaphone beside his chaff " Do you want a divorce ? " Oscar would ask when she made one of her frequent complaints . " If you . do , you can have it . I got no time to argue . " But Angela did not want a divorce . Or , to be more70THE FLAG , BOYS ! accurate , she did want a divorce . She would have been tickled pink to get rid of Oscar and wall up the television set . But then what ? Then she would be a 38 year old woman living in Putnam 's Landing without children and without a husband . There could be no more extraneous condition . In a town like Putnam 's Landing , fiercely dedicated to the perpetuation and protection of the home , only wives had status . Widows and divorcees were tolerated ; provided they had children , but a childless , unfetteredadult female was regarded , at the very best , as a second class citizen , and , in the case of one as decorative as Angela , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Putnam 's Landing , not unless she was looking to get her eyes scratched out . Nor could she move back to New York . This , for her , would be like Joe Louis returning to the ring when he did n't have it any more . New York had once been Angela 's arena , and she had been a champ . She had touched cheeks with Mr. Billingsley , Mr. Perona , and several Mr. Kriendlers . She had sat between Row C and Row J at all the openingsand against the wall at Sardi 's afterwards . She had sighed to Piaf , hummed to Dyer-Bennett , clicked to Greco . She had done the champagne-andstoutbit , the Westhampton bit , the French poodle bit . She had even had the accolade : Joe E. had sniped her drink during his act at the Copa . But that was long ago . Other , younger , firmer buttocks nested on the zebra-covered banquettes today ; prettier faces twinkled back from the barmirrors ; springier arches cha-cha 'd till the small71RALLY ROUNDhours . At 38 years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ring against such young , tough , heartless competition . And , anyhow , she had her fill of New York . The reason she married Oscar in the first place was that she had been bored silly with the flits and lushes of cafe society . She had wanted to find a man  --  a hard working , hard bearded , woman-oriented , honest-toGodman  --  and live with him in a country house and be his country wife . Oscar had been , beyond cavil , a man , and she had managed after some difficulty to get him into a country house , but then television came along and pulled him right out again , and that was the end of Angela 's sweet dream of domesticity . But the dream did not die . Angela still wanted to be a wife  --  a full time wife with a full time husband . But where would she find one ? Not in New York , where the pickings were too slim and the competitiontoo heavy . And not in Putnam 's Landing , where bachelors were as rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were plentiful in Putnam 's Landing , and Angela had often toyed with the idea of picking off one of the more looselyattachedspecimens . But she had always rejected the notion . It was , she told herself , not neighborly . Tonight , however , sitting on a chintz love-seat in a pecky cypress living room , looking out a picture window at two acres of closely barbered lawn , thoughtfully sipping another hooker of scotch , Angelabegan to wonder whether her ethics might not be misplaced . Here she was , a woman with a great untapped reservoir of wifeliness . And around her72THE FLAG , BOYS ! were dozens of discontented husbands , men who found their wives inadequate , unsympathetic , even hostile . What was Angela 's higher duty in these circumstances ? To stay aloof and let the poor souls suffer ? Or to choose the most deserving , take him to her bosom , and be to him wife , helpmeet , tender comrade , guiding star , and all the other things he had so poignantly been longing for ? Angela rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite this way . It sure put a new face on the situation . Taking somebody 's husband  --  somebody 's discontented husband , that is  --  was not thievery ; it was liberation ! Like John Brown going into Harper 's Ferry , kind of . Angela smiled , pleased with the notion of herself as Old Pottawatamie . And it was n't so far-fetched either , thought she with a righteous nod . Was n't she , too , going on a slave raid ? Was n't she going to find a man in bondage and set him free ? Of course she was . That was exactly what she was going to do  --  release a poor captive , sever his shackles , unyoke his shoulders , heal his welts , and guide his faltering feet down Freedom Road ! Satisfied that she was doing the Lord 's work , Angela got down to d tails . Who in Putnam 's Landingneeded liberati , g Well , the closest was Willard Beauchamp , who lived just a quarter of a mile down the road . Willard was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman standing just under six feet high , weighing a rock-hard 16o pounds , and filled with energy in the megaton range . This energy was directed chiefly into amateur theatricals . Currently73RALLY ROUNDshe was rehearsing A Sleep of Prisoners at the CongregationalChurch , The Dybbuk at Temple Israel , Dear Ruth at Webster High School and A Kiss for Cinderella at Nathan Hale Elementary School  --  and , at the same time , making preparations for a Fourth of July folk-drama , a re-enactment of the landing of the Redcoats on Ram 's Head Beach . To cast her plays , Laura roamed Putnam 's Landing like a onewomanpress gang , collaring anybody who did not see her first , dismissing their objections with jovial thuds on the back , dragging them into rehearsals by main force . Willard , being ready-to-hand and a good deal smaller than she , was , of course , an actor in all her productions . With a rush of pity , Angela remembered the last time she had seen him perform . It was an outdoor production of A Midsummer Night 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunic , came cavorting miserably across the village green in the teeth of a crotch-frosting March wind , brandishing a lath sword , and declaring that he was Oberon , king of all the fairies . Yes , thought Angela , Willard definitely needed liberating . But , after brief consideration , she dismissedhim and went on to the next prospect . After all , Willard was sixty years old , and who knew what shape his heart was in after all those theatricals ? No use liberating a man if he 's going to fall dead at your feet . Angela now turned her thoughts to David Coleman . David drew a comic strip called Pudgy and Spot which ran daily and Sunday in 210 newspapers . He was young , handsome , strong , and clearly74THE FLAG , BOYS ! a discontented husband , as anybody could testify who had heard him make his " Anchor " speech . In this speech , which was delivered whenever David was drunk , he developed the interesting thesis that his wife was an anchor . He , on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schooner . Once upon a time he had sailed the ocean bravely and freely , charting no course , heading only for the horizon . Then he got married . His wife , with her insatiable demands for luxuries  --  like three meals a day and a dry bed  --  had forced him to give up paintingtrue and beautiful pictures ( the proof of it was that nobody would buy them ) and instead pervert his talent into making a living . The ship , in other words , had acquired an anchor  --  an anchor that moored him to the slimy shoals of success . More anchors accrued to him  --  children , a house , cars , furniture , maids , cooks , gardeners  --  and now , his talent betrayed , his soul besmirched , he was stuck with $8o,000 a year instead of decently starving to death . No , thought Angela , passing him by . Not David . People who wear cashmere jackets should n't beat breasts . She turned next to Henry Steinberg . Henry had been a perfectly contented husband until his wifd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be so wonderful for the children , watching the miracle of birth , " declared Henry 's wife , and he had allowed himself to be persuaded . So the children had watched the miracle of birth , and had gone promptly into traumatic shock . Two75RALLY ROUNDof them were still under treatment . And the pups  --  eleven of them  --  were now going on four months old , without one single buyer having appeared in spite of ads every week in the Putnam 's Landing Gazette and every day in the New York Times . So there was Henry , stuck with eleven great , clumping , spotted , ungainly creatures , eating their own weight daily , knocking over priceless vases , teething on the Chippendale , crying all night long , and making a stench that beggared Air Wick . Yes , Henry was discontented . But it was not really serious . All he needed was eleven escaped lunatics to come around and buy his great Danes , and his marriage would be as good as new . Angela riffled through some more names , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked sports cars better than girls , one lived on blackstrap molasses , one was a television producer . Then she came to the name of Harry Bannerman . She grew very , very thoughtful . This , now , could be pay dirt . Harry Bannerman was without doubt a discontented husband . He had all the earmarks  --  the stricken face , the glazed eyeballs , the draggingfeet . And , if she needed any more evide ce , his lushing on the 5:29 was a matter of record . ' Discontented he surely was . Now to the next question : was he worth liberating ? Yes . Indeed , he was . Was n't he personable ? Presentable ? Intelligent ? Trustworthy ? Employable ? Certain of his gender ? Yes ! To all of these , yes . Harry Bannerman was a good man , and good men do not abound. 76THE FLAG , BOYS ! Angela picked up the pink telephone . She put it down again , struck by a sudden flurry of conscience . A picture of Grace Bannerman come into her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to be doing to Grace  --  honest , seemly Grace ? But , thought Angela , probing deeper , that was not the point at all . This had nothing to do with Grace ; this had only to do with Harry . He was a good man ; he deserved to be happy ; Grace had failed him ; now Angela must try . That was the American way . Angela picked up the pink telephone and dialed resolutely . " Hello , Grace ? . . . Grace , honey , this is Angela Hoffa . . . Are you and Harry going to the town meeting tonight ? . . . I know this is too tiresomeof me , but would you mind picking me up ? Oscar 's off on one of his things again . . . Thank you , lamb . Just honk . I 'll come a-running . . . Bye . " Angela put down the pink telephone and went to gird up her loins. 771GRACE BANNERMAN hung up the phone . " That wasAngela Hoffa , " she said to Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the meeting . " " Oh , for Christ 's sake ! " said Harry . " She 's ' way to hell over on the other side of town . " " Now , dear , " said Grace reprovingly . " All right , all right , " he sighed . " Let 's get going then . You ready ? " " In a minute . You go say goodnight to the children . " " Yes , ma'am , " said Harry . He hung up the towel with which he had been helping Grace dry the dinner dishes . He walked out of the kitchen area , around the breakfast bar , through the utilities area , across the dining area , past the activities area , over the family area , and up the stairs . The Bannermans lived in a moderntypehouse in which the first floor was one single sweep , divided only by waist-high counters , plant-78RALLY ROUND THE FLAG , BOYS ! ers , and shelves . This arrangement saved steps , increasedspace , promoted cleanliness , and made it flatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This progressivism did not , however , obtain on the second floor . Here walls decently separated the four bedrooms and two baths . Harry walked into the bedroom of his eldest son Dan . He found all his sons seated on the floor listening to Maggie Larkin , also seated on the floor , reading to them from The House at Pooh Corner , Dan , Bud , and Peter Bannerman , aged respectivelyeight , six and four years , were three of a kind ; each was sweet , soft , round , trusting , and vulnerable . Sometimes Harry would look at them , and his heart would be so full of love that tears would rush to his eyes . Other times he would look at them and gnash his teeth and wish fervently that there was just a little touch of guile about them , just a soupcon of meanness . Every child , including Harry 's , needed a firm hand from time to time , but how do you apply a firm hand when your kids look like three Kewpie dolls wearing " KICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Harry . " I 'm going now . " Dan leapt up and kissed his father 's cheek . " Goodnight , Papa , " he cried . Bud kissed the other cheek . " Goodnight , Papa , " he cried . Peter kissed him full on the lips . " I love you , Papa , " he cried . Maggie Larkin observed this demonstration closely . There was not , as you might expect , an approving smile on her face ; instead there was a79RALLY ROUNDsmall frown . " Mr. Bannerman , " she said , " I wonder if I might talk to you for a minute . " " Certainly , " he said . Maggie rose and went out in the hall with him , closing the bedroom door behind her . " Yes ? " said Harry . " I hope you wo n't think I 'm interfering , " said Maggie earnestly . " It really is n't any of my business , and if you do n't want to talk about it , I 'll surely understand . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's wrong with them ? " " Let me ask you the same question , Mr. Bannerman . What is wrong with them ? " " Why , nothing , " said Harry uneasily . " Nothing that I can see . " " Do they tell lies ? " asked Maggie . " Do they steal ? Do they bully other children ? " " Certainly not ! " " Aha ! " said Maggie wisely . " What do you mean  --  aha ? " demanded Harry . " Mr. Bannerman , " said she , laying a hand on his sleeve and looking frankly into his eyes , " do you think that 's normal ? Do n't you realize that in this stage of their emotional growth , they are primarily interested in themselves ? All that matters is to gratify their own wishes , their own desires . In this period children are normally selfish , normally inconsiderate . They see nothing wrong in lying , cheating , stealing , if it helps them gratify their desires . " " I see , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! inside his collar band . " Well , that 's very interesting , Miss Larkin . Now if you 'll excuse me --  " Maggie 's grip tightened on his sleeve . " That 's what worries me about your children , Mr. Bannerman . They are too good , too honest . Something has repressed their natural , normal drives . " " Yeah . Well --  " " But you ca n't bottle up things like that , " continuedMaggie , holding tight . " They 're bound to come out somewhere  --  maybe as hay fever or asthma , maybe as migraines , maybe as colitis . When a child feels something he can not express , his body will express it for him ! " " Oh , come now , Miss Larkin --  " " No , Mr. Bannerman , it 's a fact ! It 's a scientific fact . Why , only last month Sigafoos at Johns Hopkinsproved that 87% of arthritis patients first suffer the symptoms in the hand they used to masturbate with . " Harry gulped . " Is that so ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bannerman , this is a very serious thing . I hope you wo n't resent my saying it , but your children need help . " " Yes , Miss Larkin , " said Harry , removing his sleeve from her grasp . " I 'll get help for them first thing in the morning . . . But let 's not try anything tonight , okay ? I mean , for tonight , could you just kind of leave ' em alone ? Okay , Miss Larkin ? Huh ? " " Of course . " " That 's a good girl . Just read ' em a story or somethingand put ' em to bed . Okay ? " " Certainly . " 81RALLY ROUND " I appreciate that , " breathed Harry . " Goodnight . " " Goodnight . " Dashing perspiration from his brow , Harry joined Grace downstairs .

" " And tonight at the town meeting you 're making a speech to have her reinstated ? " " Harry , listen to me , " said Grace , taking his arm and leading him outside to the car . " She 's a young girl , and her head is all full of half-digested in- formation about child psychology . . . But she is also a good girl . She is basically very intelligent , and she loves children . With a little time , a little seasoning , she 'll make a wonderful teacher . And in days like these , with such a terrible shortage of teachers , I 'm not going to let this town throw away a prospect like Maggie Larkin ! " They were at the car now . Harry opened the door for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He backed out of the driveway and started down the street . Grace watched him shaking his head darkly as he drove . " It 's all right , " she smiled .

I mean , do n't ignore her , the way you always do . " " Perhaps she could sit in my lap , " suggested Harry drily . " No cracks , Harry . I feel very sorry for Angela . What kind of life can she have  --  being married to Oscar ? " " The mind trembles , " he replied . " So do be nice to her , wo n't you , dear ? " " Yes , Grace , I 'll be nice to her .

She took her hand back . " Yes , you old goat , " she said . " I 'm sure . " 8AN AMERICAN flag hung over the door . Three hundredfolding chairs stood on the unslanting floor . Across the front of the room ran a low platform on which there was a lectern for the Moderator , as the chairman of the town meeting was called . The Moderator was not yet at the lectern  --  it was still five minutes to meeting time  --  but the room was already jam-packed . All three vertical social strata of Putnam 's Landing were represented . In the front rows were the commuters , tweedy and fervent , chock-full of civic virtue , prepared to give without stint of their talent , their articulateness , their yeasty imagination . Directly behind them sat the Yankees , waiting grimly for the onslaught of rhetoric and ready with plans to table , delay , sidetrack , and defeat . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time with the Yankees , but enjoyed the meetings a whale of a lot more . As Guido 's father , Vittorio di Maggio , had once pointed out , " Town84RALLY ROUND THE FLAG , BOYS ! meeting , itsa lika opera . First one fella singsa aria , then another fella sticksa knife in his back ! " At the hub of the commuters ' sector , poised on the threshold of her shining hour , was Betty O'Sheel , head of the Study Committee on Garbage Disposal . Betty , a stolid , modest matron of 34 , had never expected to reach such heights in politics , and she had worked prodigiously to deserve the honor . For weeks her husband and two infant daughters had lived on Spam and made their own beds while Betty had pored over United States Public Health Service Bulletinson the disposal of putrescible and non-putresciblewastes ; had sent questionnaires to sanitation commissioners all over America ; had made field trips to dumps and sewers throughout Fairfield County and Long Island . Her labors had been rewarded . Unlike several earlier garbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too expensive , the proposal that Betty held in her hand tonight was  --  her friends all agreed  --  a dead-sure winner . Grace Bannerman sat next to Betty , working over her as a second works over a fighter before a bout . She soothed Betty 's jumpy nerves , assured her that victory was in the bag , promised to deal personally with any cute parliamentary tactics the Yankees might try to spring . Grace had more than a normal interest in Betty 's success tonight , for it had been Grace 's idea to pull her out of obscurity and give her this major assignment . Other , more qualified ladies had been suggested for the job , but Grace had said , " No , girls , let 's give it to Betty O'Sheel because Betty O'Sheel is a fat girl and fat girls need lots of85RALLY ROUNDlove and approval . " The others had , of course , seen the keen logic of Grace 's position . Now they could all congratulate themselves not only on making possiblea splendid report on garbage disposal , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Bannerman , who sat and wished glumly that he was at a PTA meeting instead of a town meeting . At the PTA meetings the seats had arms , and a man could safely fall asleep . Here , in these lousy folding chairs , you were liable to toppleover and crack your skull . Seated beside Harry was Angela Hoffa . She looked at his clouded eyes , his slack jaw , and she thought , " Oh yes , this is indeed a discontented husband ! Oh , yes , there is work for me here ! " She shifted a bit upwind to give Harry the full benefit of her Bellodgia . The Bellodgia wafted back a couple of rows to where First Selectman Manning Thaw was sitting . His long white nose twitched barely perceptibly ; otherwise no expression quickened his features . On either side of him sat Isaac Goodpasture and George Melvin , the real estate dealer . They stole frequent glances at Manning 's face , both wondering what secret lay locked there , why Manning had assured them so positively that tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Manning 's face told no tales . The Moderator mounted the platform , took his position behind the lectern , and gavelled for order . The Moderator , a tall , bespectacled man of sixty , was a sort of hybrid  --  a Yankee who commuted . Born86THE FLAG , BOYS ! and bred in Putnam 's Landing , he now practiced law in New York City . With one foot thus fixed in each camp , he was not too broad for the Yankees and not too narrow for the commuters , and he was currently serving his tenth consecutive term as Moderator . " Meeting will come to order , " he said . " First item on the agenda is a report from Mrs. O'Sheel of the Study Committee on Garbage Disposal .. Mrs. O'Sheel . " But before Betty could rise , Manning Thaw was on his feet . " Mr. Moderator ! " he called . " Yes , Mr. First Selectman ? " said the Moderator . " Before we get talkin ' about anything else , " said Manning , " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goodpasture and George Melvin exchanged a knowing smile . Good old Manning ! He sure was n't wasting any time springing his trap ! Good old Manning ! Shrewd old buzzard ! Betty O'Sheel turned distraughtly to Grace Bannerman . " Oh , dear ! " she cried , biting her knuckles . " He 's up to something ! If he wrecks my garbage report , I 'll just die ! Oh , stop him , Grace ! Stop that terrible old man ! " " Do n't you worry , " said Grace grimly . " I 'll fix him ! " Grace sprang to her feet with a mighty bound , startling Harry considerably . He had always found her animated at meetings , but never what you would call physical . " Mr. Moderator ! " she shouted in tones that rang like a gunshot through the chamber . Harry87RALLY ROUNDsat up straighter ; this was a Grace he had not yet seen . " Yes , Mrs. Bannerman ? " said the Moderator . " I do n't know what kind of trickery the first selectmanis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do know this : he 's dead-set against the new garbage disposal plant and he 'll go to any lengths to stop it ! Well , let him try ! In fact , I dare him to try ! But not now ! I should like to remind you , Mr. Moderator , that this meeting is conducted according to parliamentary procedures , and the first item on the agenda is the report of the garbage disposal committee . Manning Thaw can talk later if he likes , but right now the floor belongs to Betty O'Sheel ! " The commuters ' section broke into a great salvo of handclapping , with scattered cries of " Bravo ! " from the more travelled members . Harry sat and looked at Grace in pop-eyed wonder . Was this his wife ? Or was it some tigress , some firebrand , some wild , leapingthing ? Whatever it was , he wanted it . Angela Hoffa looked at Harry . How wistful his eyes , she thought , how full of longing ! " Oh , poignant yearner , " she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill the hole in your heart ! " The Moderator addressed Manning Thaw . " Mrs. Bannerman is right , Mr. First Selectman . You 'll have to wait your turn . " Without a word Manning sat down . Isaac Goodpastureand George Melvin traded a nervous glance . The first selectman 's torpedo , whatever it was , had so far turned out to be nothing but a wet firecracker. 88THE FLAG , BOYS ! " Well , Manning , " whispered Isaac , " do you still think we 're going to lick ' em ? " " Yup ! " snapped Manning . There was not a hint of doubt in his icy eyes . Isaac shrugged and turned his attention to the speaker . Betty O'Sheel stood on the platform , a sheaf of notes trembling in her hand . She took a deep breath , pressed her fat knees firmly together , and , unaccustomedas she was to public speaking , began to deliverher report loud and clear . " Garbage disposal methods , " said she , " can be divided into three broad classifications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is now being used in Putnam'sLanding . This method , as we all know , is unsatisfactorybecause it is not truly sanitary , it results in malodorous odors and it requires a constant search for new dumping grounds as old ones are exhausted . " Second , there is the incinerator method . This is a much more efficient method than the sanitary landfillmethod , but Putnam 's Landing has several times rejected proposals to build an incinerator because of the great cost and expense of construction . " The third method is what I like to call The Garbageof Tomorrow Method . ' This is the conversion of garbage into fertilizer . This is not only highly efficient and very cheap , but it is also of vast benefit to the farmers and gardeners of America . There are now several large companies in the United States which are in the business of converting garbage into commercial fertilizer . One of the biggest of these companies is the Garba-Crunch Corporation of Great Neck , Long Island . I have had several meetings with89RALLY ROUNDMr . Emil Wetkus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to report that he has surveyed our garbage problem in Putnam'sLanding and he feels confident that GarbaCrunchcan handle it . " Mr. Wetkus has offered to build a plant here which will grind up our garbage and then convert it by means of bacterial action into fertilizer . He guaranteesthat there will be no unseemly noise or malodorousodors . Garba-Crunch will charge the town $3 a ton for processing garbage , which is a clear saving of 42% over our present cost of garbage disposal . Also  --  and mark this well  --  the Garba-Crunch Corporationwill build their plant at their own expense ! Putnam 's Landing will not have to provide a penny . All we have to do is give them the land on which to put the plant . " I 'm further pleased to report that I have found a perfect site for the plant  --  the old Yarbro place , consisting of four acres on the Shore Road . I thereforemove that we buy the old Yarbro place and turn it over to the Garba-Crunch Corporation and begin a new and brighter era in garbage disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betty O'Sheel was seated , George Melvin was on his feet . " Hold on ! Hold on there ! Now hold on ! " he cried in panic . For the Yarbro place belonged to George , and he had no intention in the world of turning it into a garbage disposal plant . This , by God , was shore-front property , as valuable as platinum , even if it did dwindle somewhat at high tide. 90THE FLAG , BOYS ! You take a lot like the Yarbro place , give it an attractivename  --  Pilot 's Knob , for example  --  and you could get maybe $15,000 an acre ! If the O'Sheel woman had to have some land for a garbage plant  --  and at the moment George could not think of a single way to stop her  --  then he had plenty of bogs and fens that would do just fine . " Now , Mrs. O'Sheel , " said George with his most ingratiating smile , " I 'm going to be perfectly frank with you . The old Yarbro place is no good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want is something high and dry  --  and I 've got just the place for you . " " No , sir , " replied Betty . " It has to be the old Yarbro place . " " Why ? " asked George nervously . " Because it 's on the shore and it 's got a good anchorage , " said Betty . " Mr. Wetkus and I looked at several places before we settled on this one . As I said before , the Garba-Crunch Corporation is in Great Neck , Long Island , which , as we all know , is on the north shore of Long Island . They are going to come across the Sound and pick up our fertilizer in barges , which means that they have to have a place on the shore with a good anchorage . " " For God 's love , do something ! " hissed George at Manning Thaw . " You said we did n't have a thing to worry about . Now look at the mess we 're in ! " Manning rose . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her feet . " Mr. Moderator ! " she cried . " Point of order ! " 91RALLY ROUND " Yes , Mrs. Bannerman ? " said the Moderator . " Mrs. O'Sheel has made a motion , " said Grace . " Does the first selectman rise to speak to the motion ? " Harry looked with admiration on his wife . This keen , incisive , forceful creature  --  was she really his ? And if so , was he ever going to get to prove it ? " Your point is well taken , Mrs. Bannerman , " said the Moderator . " Mr. First Selectman , do you rise to speak to the motion ? " " We 're talking about buyin ' land , ai n't we ? " said Manning . " Well , that 's what I want to talk aboutbuyin ' land . " " Proceed , Mr. First Selectman , " said the Moderator . Manning walked to the front of the room , turned and faced his constituents , and said matter-of-factly , " The United States Army is buyin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're puttin ' in one of them guided missiles sites . Nike , it 's called . " A complete , absolute , stunned silence fell upon the assemblage . Mouths plopped open , eyes blinked . Not one word was uttered for a full minute . Great balls of fire ! thought Isaac Goodpasture . No wonder Manning was so sure that nothing would get done at the meeting tonight ! What a piece of news ! What a staggering , crushing , stupefying piece of news ! It was the Moderator who spoke first . " Mr. First Selectman , " he said , " did I understand you correctly ? The Army is putting a guided missile site92THE FLAG , BOYS ! here in Putnam 's Landing ? " " Yup , " said Manning . " Why ? " asked Rodney O'Sheel , husband to Betty . " Why should they put a guided missile site in a quiet little village like this ? We have no industry , no ship- ping , no targets of any military value . " " I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The way the Army fella explained it to me this after- noon , we 're part of a ring around Bridgeport . They 're puttin ' Nike bases in Westport and Fair- field too . An overlappin ' defense pattern , he called it , in case enemy planes try to bomb the factories in Bridgeport . " " Where 's the Army buying this hundred acres ? " asked George Melvin . " Johnnycake Hill , " said Manning . " Eek ! " said George Melvin and fell heavily into his seat . Johnnycake Hill was a two-hundred acre residential site owned by George . With the Army taking a hundred acres to shoot rockets , thought George , moaning aloud , who 'd build houses on the other hundred ? " But surely , " said Henry Steinberg the harlequin Great Dane breeder , " the Army can find someplace besides Putnam 's Landing for a base . Why do they have to put rockets and gasoline and high explosives and maybe atomic warheads right smack in the mid- dle of our town ? " " The children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She turned and faced the entire audience . " Listen to me , my friends , " she said in a voice choked with emotion , " listen to me , all of you . We have our93RALLY ROUNDdifferences here , it 's true , but on one thing we are all agreed : we love our children . Are we going to sit by and let them be scorched and blasted and scared out of their wits by rockets zooming all over the place ? No ! We must fight this thing ! We must close ranks and all work together to keep this terrible , dangerous weapon out of our town ! We must protect the children we have brought into this world ! " For the second time that evening Grace got a round of applause , but this time it came from all over the hall , not just from the commuters ' section . Grace stood erect through the ovation , her eyes bright with tears , her cheeks kindled , her head high , her shoulders back , her breasts jutting defiantly . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire and passion and thrust ! He took her hand and pulled her gently down beside him . " Listen , " he said in a low , urgent voice , " I know you 're in the Bloodmobile tomorrow , and Saturday is Bud 's birthday and Sunday is the birthdayparty and Monday Peter gets his bite-plate .. . How about Tuesday ? " " What ? " said Grace , not really hearing , her attention on the excited speeches now pouring from everywherewith no semblance of order . " How about Tuesday ? " repeated Harry . " I mean for you and me to go up to the Concord Hotel . Okay ? " " Harry , for Heaven 's sake --  " " Okay ? " he insisted . " Okay ? " 94THE FLAG , BOYS ! " Okay ! " she replied impatiently . " Now , pay attention , will you ? " George Melvin was making himself heard over the general roar . " What 's this going to do to real estate values ? " he demanded . " I 've got two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred . Now who 's going to buy the rest of it ? Who wants a house next to a rocket launcher ? . . . And do n't think I 'm the only one who 'll suffer . You 're all home owners here ; you 've all got investments to protect . What do you think your homes will be worth when the Army turns this town into a shootinggallery ? " " And what of our daughters ? " cried Laura Beauchamp , the amateur-theatricals lady . She rose now and threw her arms dramatically upward . " What of our young , innocent daughters when the town is full of sex-starved soldiers , crazed with drink ! " " I 'll tell you what the biggest irony of all is , " said David Coleman , the comic strip artist . " The biggest irony of all is that Nike does n't even work ! A couple of Air Force guys I know told me that Nike could n't hit the side of a barn ! It 's just a big boondoggle for the Army ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Air Force . " " Then why must we have it ? " shouted Laura Beauchamp . " It will ruin our daughters , ruin our homes , ruin our town , and it does n't even work ! " " What 's all the talkin ' for ? " said Manning Thaw mildly . " If the Army says we 're gettin ' it , we 're gettin ' it . " 95RALLY ROUND " We 'll see about that ! " said Laura Beauchamp grimly . " Mr. Thaw , who 's in charge of this Nike and where do we find him ? " " It 's a Colonel Thorwald , " replied the first selectman . " He 's over in Long Island  --  Fort Totten . " " All right then , " said Laura Beauchamp . " I move that we appoint a representative to visit Colonel Thorwald and tell him in the strongest possible terms that he can not put his rockets in Putnam 's Landing ! " " Good idea , " agrees George Melvin . " Let 's pick someone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes ! " cried Grace , leaping up . " My husband is a writer  --  and a darn good one ! Harry , you 'll draft the protest , wo n't you ? " " Huh ? " said Harry , blinking rapidly . " Excellent ! " exclaimed Laura Beauchamp . " I know you 'll do a fine job , Mr. Bannerman . But time is of the essence . How soon can you get it done ? " " Well --  " said Harry , still blinking . " He 'll do it over the weekend , " said Grace , " polish it up on Monday and deliver it to Fort Totten on Tuesday . " " Tuesday ! " yelped Harry . Grace looked at him askance . " Yes . Why not ? " " But do n't you " Harry began , and then abruptly stopped . What was he going to do  --  tell the whole town that he had made a date to sleep with his wife on Tuesday ? And , worse , that his wife had forgotten all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " asked Grace. 96THE FLAG , BOYS ! " Yeah , " he mumbled and sank into a snit . Angela Hoffa noted his condition and rubbed her hands . No doubt about it ; this apple was ripe for plucking . All that remained now was to find the time and the place . " Folks , " said Manning Thaw , " things bein ' how they are , had n't we better call it a night ? " " Second the motion , " said George Melvin . " Golly , " said Betty O'Sheel to Grace Bannerman , " how about the garbage thing ? " Grace waved her hand impatiently . " Next time , Betty . Not tonight . " " I guess you 're right , " said Betty bravely . " A motion to adjourn has been made and seconded , " said the Moderator . " All those in favor --  " " Aye , " came the cry . The meeting broke up into little swirls . The O'Sheels , the Steinbergs , the Beauchamps , the Colemansgathered around Grace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thing around some more , " said Rodney O'Sheel . " By all means , " said Grace . " Come on , Harry . " " I do n't want to go to Fatso 's Diner , " said Harry in a black pout . " I want to go home . " Angela Hoffa heard the brisk knock of opportunity . " As a matter of fact , sweetie , " said she to Grace , " I 'm pretty bushed myself . I 'll grab a cab and go home . " " Do n't be silly , " said Grace . " Harry will be glad to drop you  --  that is , if he 's going home . Are you , Harry ? " " Yes . " 97RALLY ROUND THE FLAG , BOYS ! " You 're sure you do n't want to come to Fatso 's ? " " Yes . " " All right , dear . " She rose on tiptoe and kissed him quickly on the cheek . " Do n't worry about me . I 'll get a ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Goodnight , honey , " smiled Angela . " Thanks for the use of your husband . " 998 " COME IN for some coffee , " " No , thanks , Angela , I 've got to be going . " " A drink ? " " No , thanks . " " Brandy ? " " No , honestly . " " What can I tempt you with ? " said Angela in mock despair . " Raisin cookies ? Eskimo Pies ? My beautiful white body ? " " Ha , ha ! " said Harry uneasily , a vision of Angela 's white body scampering lewdly across his brain-pan . " Oh , come on in ! " she said , taking him firmly by the arm . " Your wife is at Fatso 's Diner , my husband is in Hollywood , and we could both do with a little booze and sympathy . " " I guess we could at that , " he allowed and followed her into the pecky cypress living room . " I know this is going to sound awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse me while I slip into something more comfortable ? " " Of course , " said Harry , feeling a sudden twitch of excitement . He had been to enough movies to know what ladies meant when they said they were going to slip into something more comfortable . " You fix the drinks , " said Angela . " I wo n't be a minute . " Harry studied her buttocks switching up the stairs . In his ten years of marriage he had , like any redbloodedAmerican boy , had an occasional letch for a woman other than his wife . But these seizures were not so much carnal as contemplative  --  just a kind of quiet , non-urgent speculation as to what kind of bedmate this one or that one would make . Scholarly , you might call it . But now , watching Angela 's shimmering bottom , a tremor of unease shot through Harry . This , it suddenlyoccurred to him , might not be in the realm of academics . This might be available . His first impulse was to bolt . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any high moral principle , but simply because he had honestly never wanted anybody else . Why smirch the scutcheontonight ? Oh , but this was ridiculous , he told himself , movingover to the bar . Not only ridiculous , but libelous . There had never been a breath of scandal about Angela . By what right did he assume that she was a pushover tonight ? . . . No , he was ' way off base . All the woman wanted was , as she said , a little booze and sympathy. 100THE FLAG , BOYS ! And supposing , thought he , pouring himself a White Label and water , supposing she wanted more than a little booze and sympathy . Supposing she came slinking down the stairs in a transparent negligeeand pinned him to the hearthrug . Was that such a dismal prospect ? Was there anything better waiting for him at home ? In fact , was there anything at all waiting for him at home ? He took a long , angry pull on his drink . If he should end up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , but just if  --  then Grace would have nobody but herself to blame . If she had n't run off to Fatso 's Diner , he would n't even be at Angela 's right now . And , what 's more , if she was n't so goddambusy being a homemaker , clubwoman , and patriot , then he would n't be thinking about getting his jollies elsewhere ! It was Grace 's fault . Whatever happened , it was clearly Grace 's fault . He did n't want Angela . He did n't want anybody . All he wanted was his wife . But , for Pete 's sake , it was like trying to get tickets to My Fair Lady ! Having fixed the blame where it belonged , Harry turned with a good conscience to the problem at hand  --  namely , what to do when Angela came downstairs in her peek-a-boo peignoir . It had been a good long time since Harry had done anything in the seduction line , and , truth to tell , he had never been any great shakes at it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music were de rigueur . He walked now around the room and doused every light not necessary for minimum visi-1.01RALLY ROUNDbility . Then he went to the phonograph , rummaged through the albums , selected some rape-tempo Rodgers and Hart , and switched on the turntable . A fire , thought he , would lend a nice sexy glow . He knelt and lit the birch logs in the fireplace . Next he swung the sofa around to get the full benefitof the fire . He fluffed up the cushions , arranged pillows artistically in the corners . Finally he mixed two drinks  --  for himself a weak one so he could stay alert ; for Angela a double so she could not . He lit a cigarette , assumed an insouciantpose , and waited his quarry . Then he heard Angela 's footsteps coming down the stairs , and panic closed around him like a big clammy fist . " Well , I guess I better be going , " he croaked , licking his dry lips and plunging toward the door . He stopped at the foot of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negligee , but in a pair of pink velvet toreador pants and blue silk blouse , both perfectly opaque . She looked at Harry in astonishment . She looked around the room , noting the dim lights , the soft music , the fire , the rearranged sofa . She burst into peals of laughter . " Oh , no ! " she cried . " Oh , no , you ca n't go home ! Not now . Not after you 've gone to all this trouble to set the scene for a seduction ! " Harry felt his neck and face turn crimson . " And a blush too ! " exclaimed Angela delightedly . " An honest-to-goodness blush ! Oh , Harry lamb , I 'm tempted to throw myself right in your arms and yell ' Take me ! ' " 102THE FLAG , BOYS ! " Small favors gratefully accepted , " said Harry in what he hoped was a tone of light badinage . It came out more like panting . Laughing , she walked over to him and patted his cheek . She sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pointed to the cushion at her side , " Sit down . " He sat . She lifted her drink off the coffee table and tasted it . " A double , huh ? You were n't taking any chances , were you ? " " I 'll get some more water , " he said sheepishly . " No , it 's all right . " She took a slow sip , looking at him with amusement over the rim of the glass . " Well , " he said uncomfortably , " I 'll be going . " " Not just yet . " She held his hand lightly . " Let me ask you something . Do n't think I 'm not flattered , but what put these hot little thoughts in your mind tonight ? " " Well --  " " Well ? " " Well , you said you were going to slip into something more comfortable --  " " Ah ! " said Angela . " So you thought I was going up to do the kimono bit ! " " Well , that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New at the game , are n't you , son ? " " Yeah . " " Believe it or not , so am I. " " I believe it , " he said . " Now tell me , after I came downstairs in this di-103aphanous wrapper , what was your plot  --  to hop in bed with me , hop right out again , and get home before Grace does ? Wham , barn , thank you , ma'am ? " " Something like that , " he mumbled . She shook her head . " I 'm surprised , Harry . You never struck me as the Wham-Barn type . You know how I see you ? Slow and easy and romantic  --  a satin dressing-gown  --  a white scarf at your throat  --  champagnecooling in a silver bucket  --  caviar and thin rye toast  --  gleaming linen  --  candlelight  --  a balcony lookingout over the sea . . . Do you like the picture ? " " Very much , " said Harry . " There 's only one thing missing . " What ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bitterness ? " she asked . Harry shrugged . " Listen , I better hit the road . " " Oh , relax . You came in for booze and sympathy , remember ? You want to cry on my shoulder ? " " It 's a very nice shoulder but  --  no , thanks . " " Okay , " said Angela cheerfully . " No sympathy . But let me get you some more booze . " " I 'll get it . " But Angela was on her feet . " You sit still . There 's nothing I like better than doing for a man . " She went quickly to the bar in her pink toreador pants and came quickly back with a scotch and water . She gave Harry the drink and sat down beside him . " Put your feet on the coffee table , " she said . " Loosen your tie . " He put his feet on the coffee table . He loosened his tie . He leaned back . The fire was warm . The 104lights were low . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was round and fragrant . The phonograph was playing Small Hotel . " Another drink ? " said Angela . " No , " he answered . " Are you a good dancer ? " " One of the best . Are you ? " " Airy like a fairy . Come on . " They rose . Gracefully , lightly , they skimmed around the room as the phonograph played Small Hotel and Blue Moon and Bewitched , Bothered , and Bewildered . Angela was soft and weightless in his arms , and her thighs pressed pleasantly against his , and she smelled wonderful . " What are you smiling at , Harry ? " " Nothing . It 's just that I thought I 'd never feel young again . " " But you are young . " " You 're goddam right I am ! " he said vehemently . " All right , Harry , " she answered in a placating tone . " I said you were , did n't I ? " " That 's right , you did , " he admitted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty too . " " Thank you . And you are a fine figure of a man . " " And young , " he reminded her . " Do n't forget young . " " You 're a boy , Harry . That 's what you are  --  a darling , dashing , impetuous boy . " He nodded his agreement . " Listen , " he said , " Do you want to kiss me or anything ? " " That sounds jolly ! " said Angela . He looked at her to see if she was kidding . She was not . She ran her hands lightly over his cheeks . Care-105fully , deliberately , she drew his lips down to hers and gave him a long , busy kiss . " I better go now , " he said thickly . " You 've got a few minutes . " " Now , " said Harry . " It 's either go or Wham-Barn . " She disengaged herself quickly . She linked her arm in his and walked with him to the door . " Goodnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he answered , looking at the dimly lit room , the cheery fire , the luxurious sofa , the creamy lady beside him . " I do n't want to go very badly , " he said . She squeezed his hand . " Harry , " she said , " you know what we were talking about before  --  candlelight , champagne , a balcony overlooking the sea ? " " Yes ? " " There 's a lovely old hotel called the Miramar in Port Jefferson on the North Shore of Long Island . Have you ever been to Port Jefferson ? " " No . " " You 're going to be . " " Me ? When ? " " Next Tuesday . Do n't you remember ? You have to go to Fort Totten about that Nike business . Port Jefferson is only a few miles away . " " Yes ? " " Maybe , " said Angela , averting her eyes in a maidenlymanner , " maybe when you 're through at Fort Totten , you could go over to Port Jefferson . Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly felt his ardor ebb away and his heart grow chill . It was one thing to put horns on 106your wife when it happened quite unexpectedly ; then you could chalk it up to a temporary derangement , a lapse of the moment . But when premeditationcame into the picture  --  when you laid plans , booked hotel rooms , took trips  --  you were clearly out of the novice class ; you had won your " A " for sure . " Gee , Angela , I do n't know , " he said doubtfully . " All right , darling , let 's forget it . " " Maybe we better . " " Sure . . . Goodnight , Harry . " " Goodnight , Angela . " He stood indecisively , wondering whether in these circumstances protocol called for a goodnight kiss . His problem was settled as Angela suddenly threw herself in his arms and gave him a fierce , probing kiss . " Oh , darling , let me make you happy ! " she whispered and stood without moving as his hands flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said softly in his ear . " Port Jefferson . " She opened the door , let him out , pointed him at his car , closed the door and returned to her drink . " He 'll be there ! " she said aloud , smiling confidently into her glass . " Like hell I will ! " said Harry aloud , driving through the night. 10 " MY TEETH , " said Guido di Maggio . " Your teeth , did you say ? " asked Major McEstway , post adjutant . " Yes , " said Guido . " Look . " He leaned forward across the Major 's desk and opened his mouth wide . " In a minute , " said Major McEstway and turned his attention to a crop-haired , angry faced captain wearing a chest full of battle ribbons who had just come into the office . " Yes , Captain , " he said . " I 'm Walker Hoxie , " said the newcomer . " Colonel Thorwald sent for me . " " Hello , Captain Hoxie , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Captain regarded Guido blankly . " I 'm Guido di Maggio , " said Guido . " We met briefly at the club the other night . Remember ? " Walker Hoxie gave Guido an ill-tempered grunt and turned abruptly back to the Major . " Okay to go in ? " he asked 108RALLY ROUND THE FLAG , BOYS ! " Go ahead , " said the Major . Walker Hoxie went past the adjutant 's desk and into the office of Colonel Thorwald , battalion commander . Guido , watching him , suppressed a shudder . Mean looking bastard , he thought . " Who 's this guy Hoxie ? " he said to Major McEstway . " He 's going to command one of the new bases , " replied the Major . " But never mind him . Get back to your story . I 'm fascinated ! " " Where was I ? " said Guido . " You were explaining why you could n't go to Alaska , " the Major prompted . " Something about your teeth . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Major . " Look here , " he said , pointing at his molars . " See all those fillings ? " " Yes . " " Morbidly sensitive to cold , every one of them . Know what happens if I eat ice cream ? " " No , " confessed the Major . " Agony ! " declared Guido . " Wild , screaming agony ! " " Pity ! " murmured the Major . " What 's it going to be like when I get to the frozen North ? " said Guido . " Agony ? " ventured the Major . " Wild , screaming agony ? " " Right ! " said Guido . " I 'll be no use at all to the battery . I 'll be in the dentist 's chair all day long . " " Tell you what , " said the Major brightly . " We 'll have all those teeth pulled before you go ! " 109RALLY ROUND " Very funny ! " muttered Guido , casting the Major a baleful look . " Lieutenant , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " Sir , you 're making a big mistake ! " cried Guido . " How can you send me to Alaska ? I 'm an Italian . For a thousand years my family lived in sunny Napoli . Could n't you find a Swede ? " " I want you to know , Lieutenant , " said the Major , clasping Guido 's hand , " that when I ship you out , I will count it as a great personal loss . In these last couple of weeks , you have brought bushels of joy into this dreary life . Now get out of here so I can get some work done . " Guido started disconsolately for the door , but before he reached it , in walked a civilian , a tall man of thirty-some years . Guido looked at him curiously . Somewhere he had seen that face before ; he would take his oath on it . " Can I help you , sir ? " said Major McEstway to the civilian . " I 'm Harry Bannerman , " said the civilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Go right in , sir " said Major McEstway . Ah ! thought Guido . Now he remembered . Harry Bannerman of Putnam 's Landing . They did n't exactlymove in the same social circle , but Guido had seen him around town a few times . What , thought Guido , was he doing here ? Then another question crossed Guido 's mind . The Major had told him that Captain Hoxie was going to command a new base . Then along came Harry11.0THE FLAG , BOYS ! Bannerman from Putnam 's Landing . Could it be more than a coincidence ? Was it possible that the new base would be at Putnam 's Landing ? But why speculate ? Why not find out ? He walked quickly out of Post Headquarters , around to the back of the building , squinched down under Colonel Thorwald 's open window , and listened . Captain Walker Hoxie was not angry all the time  --  only in peacetime . In wartime a professional soldier  --  like Captain Walker Hoxie  --  had stature . He was somebody ; he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peacetime ? Hind tit , that 's what . Coolie wages , that 's what , and sweat-shop hours , and assignment to holes that would appall a gopher ... But never mind all that . What really griped CaptainWalker Hoxie , what churned his guts and ground down his back teeth , was that the average American civilian regarded the professional soldier as an out-and-out bum ! If a man was able to make a living anyplace else , asked the average civilian in a tone that brooked no rebuttal , why in the world would he choose to stay in the Army ? Such an assumption in the case of Captain Walker Hoxie was a plain canard . Walker was a guided missileexpert  --  a category woefully short in the Army , but even more woefully short in private industry . He could have resigned his commission any day and gone to work for a fancy salary at some missile or electronics factory , but the hateful thought never111RALLY ROUNDcrossed his mind . He flatly did not want to be a civilian . He had never had a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a civilian in the moonshine line in Searcy County , Arkansas , had walloped him daily until he ran away from home at the age of sixteen . For the next two years he had drifted around , ridingthe rods , picking a little fruit , piling up a goodly collection of vagrancy raps , and getting his skull banged regularly by yard bulls , deputies , and turnkeys  --  allcivilians . In 1934 , aged eighteen and seekinga place to lie down fill his ears stopped ringing , he walked into an Army recruiting office and signed up . He loved the Army from the very beginning . For one thing , people stopped hitting him in the head . For another , his life finally took on meaning . He had a mission at last , and not a small one : to protect and defend the United States of America . He was a sergeant when World War II broke out . He came back from overseas with a battlefield commissionfor gallantry . In Korea he won the Bronze and Silver stars . After Korea , harking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred to Fort Bliss , overcame an extensive inacquaintance with mathematics , took a full year 's course in Nike , and ended up an expert technician . Then , to his unspeakable disgust , he was sent to Fort Totten , Long Island . It was not Fort Totten which disgusted him . Fort Totten had , after all , acres of dusty drill fields , rows of ugly barracks , hordes of milling troops ; it was , in short , homey. 112THE FLAG , BOYS ? What raised Walker 's gorge was that the assignmentwas only temporary : he was scheduled to leave shortly to take command of a new Nike installationat some place called Putnam 's Landing . It would not be a post , mind you , not a base , not even an encampment  --  but just a tiny enclave of troops entirely surrounded by civilians ! And now it gave him a conspicuous lack of pleasure to be sitting with one of those very same civilians  --  aman named Harry Bannerman  --  in the office of Colonel Thorwald , battalion commander . Colonel Thorwald , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Colonel was a portly , patientWest Pointer of sixty years who had learned that the only way to run a Nike command was to keep smiling . You could never find a community that wanted Nike ; you could never find enough qualified officers to run a battery . This left you two choices : smile or Section 8 . " How do you do , Mr. Bannerman , " said he , smiling . " I am Colonel Thorwald , battalion commander . This is Captain Hoxie . I have asked him to join us because he will be in charge at Putnam 's Landing when we build the base . . . Now then , Mr. Bannerman , we are delighted that you are here because the only way we will get our little differences settled is by honest , friendly discussion . Have a seat , sir , and tell us what is on your mind . " What was on Harry 's mind was to get out of this ridiculous situation forthwith . But Grace was depending on him , and after his recent session113RALLY ROUNDof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be well to play the dutiful husband for a spell . " Well , " said he , trying hard to conceal his sheepishness , " we feel that the Army should reconsider putting a Nike base in Putnam 's Landing . Surely you can find a more suitable place than a quiet little residential town like ours . " Walker gritted his teeth silently . Lousy civilians , he thought . They were all alike . You go in and try to save their stinking skins , and what do you get ? The back of their hands , that 's what you get . " What I mean , " said Harry , wishing fervently he were somewhere else , " is that a Nike base will upseteverything in our little community  --  social equilibrium , real estate values , things like that . " A column of red climbed rapidly up Walker 's neck . Lousy , maggoty civilians , he thought . Pudgy palmed , shifty-eyed , gray flannel crud . " So , " concluded Harry with a wan smile , " now that you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will look a little harder and find some other place . " " Thank you , Mr. Bannerman , " said the Colonel courteously . " What you say is very interesting , and , of course , we quite see your point . Do n't we , CaptainHoxie ? " " Yes , sir , " said Walker . " We see the point , all right . The point is that Putnam 's Landing is full of yellow-livered , money-grubbing , fat-bellied feather merchants , and if I had my way , I 'd line ' em up against the wall and shoot the whole sickening lot of ' em ! " 114THE FLAG , BOYS ! " Aghast " is the word for the Colonel 's face at this point . Unmistakably " aghast . " Walker bounded out of his chair and stuck his nose , quivering with fury , an inch away from Harry 's . " What 's all this crap about real estate values ? " he demanded . " Your country is in danger . The United States of America is in danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of commie rat bastard ? " Now Harry was on his feet too , every bit as outragedas Walker . " Just a minute ! " he shouted . " I 'm not going to stand here and have my patriotism impugned . It so happens that I did my bit in the last war ! " " Sure , " sneered Walker . " You were drafted . If you 're such a hotshot patriot , why did n't you re-enlist ? " A moan escaped the Colonel 's lips and his mind turned longingly to the good old days when officers were gentlemen . Now they were technicians , and when you had one as good as Walker , you had to count yourself lucky . If he happened also to be a churl and a boor , all you could do was keep smiling and thank God he was n't a geek . " But no ! " Walker was yelling at Harry . " You would n't re-enlist . Defending the USA ai n't good enough for high class guys like you . That 's for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , all right , mister . We 'll save your bacon for you . We always have and we always will . But just do n't be getting in our way . Do n't be telling us where we can put our bases and where we ca n't . That 's our business ! " 115RALLY ROUND " What the Captain means , " said Thorwald with a conciliatory smile , " is that  --  I do n't give a damn what the Captain means ! " bellowed Harry in a blind fury . What the hell was he doing here anyhow ? What did he care if Nike came to Putnam 's Landing ? How did he ever get into this horrid situation ? . . . How ? He knew damn well how . Grace , that 's how ! " You see , sir , " said the Colonel pressing on gamely , " we have made a careful study of defense requirements " You sure as hell have n't made a study of public relations , " retorted Harry hotly . " Or of common courtesy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stormed out of the office . He had left a cab waiting in front of Post Headquarters . He flung himself into the back seat and slumped in a corner , trembling with anger . " Back to the railroad station ? " said the driver . " Yeah , " growled Harry , full of black bitterness . Thank you , Grace , he thought savagely . Thank you very much for this pleasant excursion . And for all the other joys you have brought into my life . Thank you for the rollicking days in the Bloodmobile , the enchanted evenings at the PTA . Thank you for making a pygmy out of what used to be a man . " Driver ! " shouted Harry suddenly , so suddenly that the driver almost lost the wheel . " *I do n't want to go to the railroad station . I 've changed my mind  --  and high time , by God ! " " Where do you want to go ? " asked the driver. 116THE FLAG , BOYS ' " Do you know the I-Hotel Miramar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take me there , " said Harry with determination . " Let the revels begin ! " Guido di Maggio , listening underneath Colonel Thorwald 's window , was struck with the most brilliantidea of his entire life . He scampered quietly away from the Colonel 's window , ran around to the front of the building , and burst into the office of Major McEstway , post adjutant . " Major , " he cried breathlessly , " I have to see ColonelThorwald right away ! " " What you have to do right away , " said the Major , " is go pack your gear . I just got a call from Mitchel Field . There 's an airplane waiting for you . " " No , no ! " said Guido frantically . " I ca n't go ! I have to see the Colonel ! " A steely edge came into Major McEstway 's voice . " All right , Lieutenant , it 's been fun , but playtime is over . Go get packed , and be back here in fifteen minutes . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left him no alternative . He walked out of Major McEstway 's office , out of Post Headquarters , around to the back of the building , over to Colonel Thorwald 's open window , put his hands on the sill , and vaulted into the office . Colonel Thorwald and Captain Hoxie whirled and looked at Guido in pop-eyed wonder. 117RALLY ROUNDBefore they could recover , Guido started talking at machine-gun rate : " Colonel , sir , I know this is a little irregular , but believe me , sir , you 'll thank me when you hear what I got to say . . . Colonel , sir , let 's face it , sir , when you send Captain Hoxie to Putnam 's Landing , you are going to have yourself one hell of a public relations problem . True ? " Still stunned , the Colonel nodded dumbly . " Colonel , sir , " continued Guido , pressing his advantagehard , " I got a way to lick it . What you need is an executive officer for Captain Hoxie who can not only perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can also conduct a public relations campaign . . . Me , for instance , Colonel , sir , I was born and raised in Putnam 's Landing and I know everybody in town and I played ball there and I was on the Scouts and the school police and I tell you the honest truth , Colonel , sir , there is not a soul in Putnam 's Landing that does not have only the highest esteem for me . You send me up there , Colonel sir , and I guarantee you I will put on a public relations program that will have the whole town clasping us to their bosom ! " Walker Hoxie found his tongue first . " Colonel , " he said , " what do you want me to do with this lunatic ? " " Just a minute , " said Thorwald to Walker . To Guido he said , " What kind of public relations program ? " " Well , sir , " replied Guido , his fine Italian mind racing , " first I 'd call a special town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Nike is perfectly safe . Then I 'd go around town and make friends with all the important organizations . I 'd speak to the Kiwanisand Rotary and Lions . I 'd sign up with the Red Cross blood bank . I 'd ask the clergy if they needed anybody for their choirs . I 'd enlist the men in the volunteer fire department . " " Colonel , you 're not really listening to this guy ? " asked Walker incredulously . " As a matter of fact , yes , " answered the Colonel . " And , what 's more , I 'm liking what I 'm hearing . Continue , Lieutenant . " " Yes , sir , " said Guido , ideas flooding into his brain as his confidence mounted . " I 'd do a lot of work with kids , because kids are the No. i industry of Putnam 's Landing . I 'd station soldiers at school crossings . I 'd show films at assemblies . I 'd give camping lessons to the Scouts . I 'd manage a Little League team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " snarled Walker . " Captain , " said Thorwald , turning patiently to Hoxie , " this boy has ideas about public relations . Do you ? " " Certainly not ! " cried Walker , deeply offended . " That 's what I figured , " said Thorwald . " Captain , I 'm afraid my course is clear . I must admit I have certain reservations about an officer who comes leaping through my window , but just the same , he does have a public relations program for Putnam 's Landing  --  and with you in command , God knows we 'll need one . . . I 'm sending him along as your exec and P.R.O . " 11.9 " Now wait a minute " That , " said the Colonel mildly , " is an order . " " Yes , sir , " said Walker through clenched teeth . " Oh , thank you , Colonel ! " cried Guido ecstatically . " You 'll never regret it . " " See that you do n't ! " warned the Colonel , a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  he nodded at Walker  --  " I ca n't replace . But you "  --  he pointed an ominous finger at Guido  --  " I damn well can ! " " Yes , sir , " quaked Guido . " I 'll have no nonsense from you , " said Thorwald , fixing Guido with a bird-colonel 's glare . " No jumpingthrough windows , no cutting up , no goofing . You 're going to Putnam 's Landing to do a job , and , by God , you better deliver ! " " Oh , I will , sir ! " declared Guido . " I will ! " " What 's your name ? " " Guido di Maggio , sir . " The Colonel frowned thoughtfully . " Are n't you on a shipping list to Alaska ? " " There 's been some rumors , " shrugged Guido . " Nothing definite . " " Well , I 'll tell you something definite , " said Thorwald . " I 'll give you time to get things organized in Putnam 's Landing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if I do n't see results , you 'll be in Alaska the very next morning , I promise you ! " " Yes , sir , " quavered Guido . The Colonel gave Guido a final scowl and flipped the key on his inter-office squawk box . " Major McEstway ? " he said. 1.20 " Yes , Colonel , " came the voice of the adjutant . " I 'm assigning Lieutenant Guido di Maggio to Putnam 's Landing , " said Thorwald . " Cut some orders . " The squawk box was silent for several seconds . " Are you there , Major ? " asked Thorwald . " Yes , sir , " came the voice . " What are you doing ? " " I am taking my hat off to Lieutenant Guido di Maggio , " said the Major reverently. 11VITTORIO , the father ; Serafina , the mother ; Anna and Teresa , the sisters ; and Pete , Bruno , Dominic , and Carmen , the brothers , were all in festive array on the station platform when Guido arrived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeted him con amore , kissed him allegro , whacked him fortissimo , and then Vittorio grabbed him by the arm and headed him toward the delivery truck that served as a vehicle when the di Maggios travelled en famine . " Come on , " said Vittorio . " Letsa go home . " Guido freed his arm . " You go ahead , Pa . I have to make a stop first . " " Ah , come on ! " cried Serafina , the mother , giving him a two-handed thump on the back that sent him reeling into the tailgate of the truck . " Come on home . We got ta big surprise !

" " Listen " said Guido , but the four brothers , two on each side , grabbed his elbows and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , and Vittorio started the motor and home they went . The first thing Guido noticed when he came into the house was how tidy the living room was : not a speck of dust , not a newspaper , not a cigar butt , not a stray sock anywhere . Then , walking forward , he saw that the dining room table was covered with the good lace cloth and set with the hand-painted Trylon-and Perisphere dinner plates . " Gee , Ma , this is great , " he said , touched , " but you did n't have to go to all this trouble just for me . " " Who says itsa for you ? " asked Vittorio . The others thought this was a mighty fine joke and laughed and winked and nudged each other with great gusto . " Is somebody else coming ? " asked Guido . This , too , was considered wildly hilarious . At length Vittorio raised his hand for order . When all was still , he called , " Okay , surprise . You come out now ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Out stepped Maggie Larkin , demure in a navy blue dress with a little white collar and little white cuffs . A pretty blush was on her cheeks , a tentative smile on her lips . " Hello , Guido , " she said shyly. 123RALLY ROUND " But " said Guido . Then he said , " Whatand " Er " and " But " a few more times . " Hey , dumb ! " said Vittorio , giving him the elbow . " Go kissa you girl ! " " But I do n't understand , " said Guido .

He gave her a timid kiss , but she pulled him close and made a job of it . " Brava ! " cried the di Maggios , applauding thunderously . " Bis ! Bis ! Brava ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Eat , eat , eat ! " Anna and Teresa went into the kitchen with Serafina to fetch the dinner . Maggie tried to go along to help , but Vittorio grasped her firmly and put her in a chair . " You sit , " he said . " You guesta honor . Guido , you guesta honor too . Sit . " " Yes , Pa , " said Guido , still in a daze . He took a chair on Maggie 's right , Vittorio sat on her left , and the brothers took their accustomed places . " Shesa good girl , you Maggie , " said Vittorio , givingher round young arm an affectionate tweak . " She wasa pretty craze , but shesa all right now . " " Look , " said Guido to Maggie . " I do n't want to pry , but what happened ?

" he said raising his glass . Maggie looked into Guido 's eyes and smiled and squeezed his hands as the others drank the toast . " You gon na tell me what happened ? " asked Guido . " Have some scungilli , " said Teresa , passing a plate to Maggie . Maggie took some . " Delicious ! " she exclaimed . " What is it ? " " Snake , " said Bruno . The smile left Maggie 's face ; the fork stopped halfway to her mouth . " Itsa not snake ! " said Serafina indignantly . The smile came back to Maggie 's face ; the fork continued upward .

" Well , " continued Maggie , " Mrs. Bannerman decidednot to go to the meeting , but she asked me to stay anyhow because she wanted to talk to me . So we made coffee and had a long , long talk , and Guido , it was one of the most wonderful experiences of my whole life ! " " What did you talk about ? " " Children . . .

" " You wasa pretty craze , all right , " said Vittorio . " Yes , I was , " said Maggie forthrightly . " But no more . As I told Mr. Vandenberg this morning , from now on I am going to be completely sensible and practical about children . No more wild theories ! " " Mr. Vandenberg , the principal ? " asked Guido .

Then Guido took Maggie away and drove with127RALLY ROUNDher to a public park called Tall Walnuts  --  a lovely spot with lovers ' lanes and secret glades and toweringwalnut trees as ancient as the hills .

Why then , wondered Harry , should he feel so miserable ? In the first place , it was Grace 's fault , not his , that he had strayed from righteousness . In the second place , the session with Angela , once he had ingested enough champagne to still his fluttering ganglia , had been a jolly amalgam of lyricism and know-how .

Now as he sat and rolled his hot brow against the cool window pane , his Angst was suddenly interrupted by a voice in the seat beside him saying explosively , " Jesus H. Christ ! " A few minutes earlier when somebody had taken the seat next to his , Harry had not turned to see who it was . Now he did . The blood rushed out of Harry 's head .

" " Very interesting , " said Harry . " Would you excuse me , please ? I 'd like to get a drink of water . " " You take television , " continued Oscar , unheeding . " When I plan a program , do you think I even consider what men want to look at ? Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nine p.m. a man looks at the programs his kids want to see . From nine to midnight , the wife picks the programs . And at midnight the poor sonofabitch has to go to bed becauseat six in the morning he 's got to get up and go to work and make some more money so she can build another wing on the goddam house ! " " If you 'll just kind of move your legs a little so I can squeeze by " Television ! Christ , what a way to make a living ! I bet I 've got more flying time than Rickenbacker . I just came back from Hollywood last night , and where do you think I 'm going this afternoon ? That 's right  --  Hollywood ! Just keep watching the obit page , pal . I 'll be there soon ! " " Oscar , I hate to be a bother , " said Harry , laying a firm hand on his knee , " but I really do have to get a drink of water . " " Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legs. 135RALLY ROUND Harry went to the cooler and had four quick glasses of water , but his throat was still parched . Then he went out on the platform and gulped air all the way to Grand Central , but his chest was still tight . Nor did his throat get moister or his chest get looser or his conscience get easier all that day . Not until he boarded the 5:29 back to Putnam 's Landing and belted down his first I. W. Harper did a sem- blance of calm return to him . He took his second drink to a quiet corner , sat down , and did some strong thinking . One thing was perfectly clear : infidelity was not his kind of work . Never again would he wander off the reservation . Never ! Next question : should he make a full confession to Grace ? Answer : no . Why confess ? It would only give Grace a lot of grief , and he had wronged the poor woman quite enough already . The way to make things up to Grace was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of husband she wanted him to be  --  mature , responsible , family- oriented , civic-minded . He highly resolved that starting today he would be precisely such a husband . Correction : not starting today . Starting tomorrow . Before he put his feet on the straight and narrow path , he wanted one more whirl around the May- pole . With Grace , of course . Only with Grace . To- night when he got home he would say to her , " Honey , you see before you a new man  --  mature , re- sponsible , family-oriented , civic-minded . Let us cele- brate this reformation . Let us go tonight to a country inn and have a bird and a bottle . Then let us go 136 upstairs and spend the night . Let us hold each other very tight and look upon the moonswept lawn and declare our love . Let us store up precious memories to sustain us in the busy days ahead . " Yes , thought Harry , nodding his head energetically , that was exactly what he would do  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifetime of earnestness . And he would insist on a country inn tonight . No matter what plans Grace might have made , he would force her to cancel them . There would be plenty of other nights to be mature , responsible , family-oriented , and civic-minded . This night was for love , and love alone . He had one more drink to shore up his determination , and then the train arrived at Putnam 's Landing , and he got off , and it was pouring rain , and Grace was not there to meet him . She had never failed to show up before , and Harry was frankly worried . He waited fifteen minutes and then phoned home . " Hello ! " cried Grace in a frantic voice . " Honey , what 's the matter ? " " Oh , everything ! " she replied angrily . Harry felt a bolt of fear plunge through his belly . " It does n't  --  it does n't have anything to do withwithAngela Hoffa , does it ? " he stammered . " Angela Hoffa ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why should it ? " Harry 's heart came down from his glottis . " Then what 's wrong ? " he asked . " I ca n't talk now . Get a cab , will you ? " " Yes , dear . " 137RALLY ROUND " Hurry ! " She clicked the phone down . Harry went over to the taxi stand . The cabs in Putnam 's Landing were operated on a share-the-ride system . Six other pas- sengers were dropped off before Harry , fuming with anxiety , reached his home a full hour later . His anxiety was not lessened by the sight of three vehicles parked in front of his house : a truck bear- ing the legend MINTON EVANS  --  LANDSCAPER ; another truck saying WALDO PIKE  --  HARD- WARE ; and a 1948 Studebaker sedan belong to Dr. Magruder . Harry paid the cab driver , got out in the rain , walked through his front gate , and found the lawn missing . Missing . It was gone . There was no lawn . Harry 's house stood on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred feet below . " How picturesque ! " Grace had cried upon first see- ing the location , and nothing would do except they buy this house . Picturesque it was without a doubt . But there were certain shortcomings . For one thing , there was not a level inch of ground for the kids to play on . Every time they went outside and threw a ball , it promptly rolled down the hill , into the brook , and out to sea . Harry figured that he had , at a conserva- tive estimate , $500 worth of balls bobbing in Long Island Sound . Then there was the problem of the lawn . A dozen times they had planted grass seed , only to have the first rain wash it straight down the hill . Finally they 138 called in Minton Evans , who , at horrendous expense , gouged out a terrace fifty feet below the house and built a stout retaining wall that held the grass for almost three weeks . Then he built a stouter retaining wall that did the job for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in the wall but in the grass , and he sold them a quarter acre of turf , which cost only a trifle more than broadloomcarpeting . Now Harry , his mouth agape with horror , stood in the drenching rain and stared at the raw brown earth which had been a lawn only this morning , and watched strips of turf slither sluggishly over the retaining wall and down the hill and into the brook . Minton Evans , dressed in a yellow slicker and rainhat , looking like an elderly , cupidinous Uneeda Biscuit boy , came walking over to Harry . " It 's that atom bomb , " he said . " What ? " shrieked Harry . " An atom bomb fell here ? " " No , no , no , " chuckled Minton . " I mean it 's them atom bomb explosions that causes all this Bang rain . I 've lived in these parts man and boy for more than sixty years and never seen so much rain ! " " Listen , " cried Harry furiously , " you told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Mr. Bannerman , " said Minton reasonably , " it ai n't me settin ' off all them atom bombs . " " Oh , God damn it ! " screamed Harry , stamping his foot in the mire . " Oh , God damn it to hell ! " He slogged through the ooze and , ignoring the doormat , stormed into the house . Grace was sitting139RALLY ROUNDat the desk in the activities area writing a check , while Waldo Pike , hardware , stood behind her , his beady eyes bright with avarice . " Now what ? " yelled Harry . " Oh , hello , dear , " said Grace . " Howdy , Mr. Bannerman , " said Waldo , not quite tugging his forelock . " What are you writing a check for ? " roared Harry , brushing aside the greetings . " A new washing machine , " replied Grace . " What ? " whispered Harry , aghast . " Well , dear , " said Grace , " I just got sick and tired of Mr. Pike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , did you ? " snarled Harry . " I rather looked forward to his visits . " " Ah , you 're a card , Mr. Bannerman ! " said Waldo appreciatively . " And you 're a thief ! " yelled Harry . " This is the third time you 've sold us a new washer . What the hell kind of machines are you bringing us ? " " Oh , the machines are all right , " Waldo assured him . " It 's the sand . " " What sand ? " " Your boys , " explained Waldo . " They go out and play in the sandbox , and their pockets get full of sand , and then Mrs. Bannerman puts their overalls in the machines , and the sand gets in the camshaft . " " Yeah ? " said Harry accusingly . " Last time you told us it was the soap flakes . What 's it going to be next time  --  the water ? " " Yes , sir , you 're a card ! " said Waldo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , when I was down the cellar , I noticed your power tool 's gettin ' pretty beat-up . Got some dandy new ones down at the store . " " You get out of here ! " said Harry , advancing murderouslyon the hardware merchant . " Well , goodnight , " said Waldo and pocketed the check and departed . " My , you 're in a nice , pleasant mood , " said Grace sharply to Harry . " What kind of mood you expect me to be in when I come home and find myself teetering on the brink of bankruptcy ? " " And what about me ? " said Grace hotly . " I 'm the one who had to be here and suffer through all of it  --  the washer breaking , the lawn floating away , the boy getting sick " " What boy ? " interrupted Harry . " Peter . " " What 's wrong with him ? " " I do n't know . Dr. Magruder 's upstairs with him now . " " Oh , grand ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close behind . Harry ran into Peter 's bedroom . There at the bedsidesat old Doc Magruder , looking more like a NormanRockwell picture than ever . Peter , on the other hand , looked like the picture of Dorian Gray . His face was covered with hideous red bumps and blotches . But underneath the afflictions he was chipperenough . " Hello , Papa dear , " he said happily . " What 's the matter with him ? " said Harry to Doc. 141RALLY ROUND " Beats the dickens out of me ! " answered Doc cheerfully . " Well , what do you think it is ? " demanded Harry . " Eczema ? Impetigo ? Poison ivy ? Psoriasis ? " " What 's psoriasis ? " asked Doc . " Oh , for Christ 's sake ! " snarled Harry and went over and kicked the wall . " Ai n't really a heck of a lot we know about skin diseases , " confessed Doc with a chuckle . " You 've heard the old saying : some we treat externally , some we treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumbled in his throat . " Keep bringing the boy to my office every two , three days , " said Doc to Grace . " We 'll try everything . Something 's bound to work sooner or later . " " Thank you , healer , " said Harry with a tight smile . " Forget it , " replied Doc . " Well , better be going . Getting on to suppertime . " Harry and Grace saw Doc to the door . Then Harry turned on his wife and said angrily , " Would you mind telling me why you called that old quack ? " " But everybody uses him , " she answered . " Sure ! " cried Harry , waving his arms . " And everybodyuses Minton Evans and everybody uses Waldo Pike ! Patsies , that 's what we are , the whole lot of us ! And you know who 's the biggest patsy of all ? Me  --  for letting myself get into this mess ! " He turned on his heel , strode across the family area , into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yanked the cork savagely out of the first bottle that came to hand. 142THE FLAG , BOYSI " That 's right , " said Grace , walking bellicosely towardhim . " Get drunk . You did n't have enough on the train . Drink some morel " Harry paused . The train . What happened to all the good resolutions he had made on the train ? Had he not made up his mind to be mature , responsible , family-oriented , civic-minded ? Was this a way to start  --  by diving into a bottle of booze ? He put the cork back in the bottle . " Grace , I 'm sorry , " he said quietly . " Forgive me . I should n't have lost my temper . After all , these little crises are part of being a father and home-owner and citizen , are n't they ? " " Huh ? " said Grace , her mouth falling open . Harry concentrated for a moment , remembering his pretty speech . " Honey , " he said , " you see before you a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So let 's celebrate this reformation . Let 's go to a country inn tonight and have a bird and a bottle , and then let 's go upstairs and spend the night and hold each other very tight and store up memories to sustain us in the days ahead . " " Boy , you are loaded ! " " No , honey , I am perfectly serious . Is it a date ? " " What are you talking about ? " " Us . A country inn . Tonight . " " Have you taken leave of your senses ? " she asked with considerable exasperation . " You know very well there 's a special town meeting tonight to hear Guido di Maggio . " Harry felt a red tide of rage come pumping up143RALLY ROUNDfrom under his breastbone . Resolutely he pushed it back . " What do you say we skip it , huh , honey ? " he said , smiling . " Skip it ! " she exclaimed . " You  --  of all people  --  to talk about skipping it ? After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , and you failed so dismally , do you think you can just wash your hands of the whole business ? " The rage would not stay down . " Grace , God damn it , I do n't want to go to the town meeting ! I want to make love to you tonight ! " " Quiet ! " she hissed . " The children ! " " Grace , " he said in a lower voice , " why wo n't you let me make love to you tonight ? " " All right , Harry , we 'll go to the meeting and then we 'll come home and make love when we go to bed . " " No ! " " Why not ? Is n't that when people make love ? When they go to bed ? " " I do n't care what people do ! I 'm talking about you and me  --  and why the hell we ca n't ever get together . " Grace frowned . " Harry , I do n't understand you . Are you trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , but " But what ? Have I ever refused you when you wanted me ? " " You 're damn right ! " said Harry stoutly . " Plenty of times . " 144THE FLAG , BOYS ! " Sure , " admitted Grace . " When the kids were pounding on the bedroom door . When there was an omelette on the stove . But I mean at night after we 've gone to bed . " " I do n't want you at night after we 've gone to bed . " In Heaven 's name , why not ? " " Because , " said Harry , " at night it 's not instead of something . " " I do n't follow you . " " All right , I 'll spell it out . At night when we make love , it 's just another item on a schedule . . . Eight a.m.  --  get the kids to school . Ten a.m.  --  Red Cross ... Twelve noon  --  lunch . Seven p.m.  --  dinner . Twelve midnight  --  sleep with Harry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an item on a schedule , I want to be important enough to postpone things for , to rearrange things , to drop them if you have to . " " Oh , Harry , grow up ! " she begged . " Will you please , finally , at long last , grow up ? " " We have covered this subject too many times , " said he coldly . " We will not go over it again . Just answer one question : will you come to a country inn with me tonight ? " " No . " " Grace , " he said quietly , " I love you . I love you with all my heart . Will you please come with me ? " " Harry , stop being a damn schoolboy . There 's an important meeting tonight , and we have an obli-gation . " The red rage came again . It filmed his eyes and145RALLY ROUNDconstricted his chest so he could scarcely breathe . " All right ! " He spat the words . " All right , God damn it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curses at his ex-lawn , he stomped over to the garage , got into the car , and zoomed out of the driveway like a projectile . Where he was going he knew not . But the car knew . It seemed to know also that Oscar Hoffa was away in Hollywood . Within a quarter of an hour Harry was knocking on Angela 's door . She opened the door . A triumphantsmile lit her face . Harry stepped silently into the house . Angela closed the door . Harry reached for her , pulled her close , kissed her hard . " Angela , I want to go to bed with you , " he said , holding her . " So do I , darling , " she answered . " Oh , so do I ! " She kissed him fiercely , her mouth wild , her nails digging . She took his arm , led him to the couch , sat down beside him , kissed him again . " I have to tell you something first , " she said . " Later . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm going away for a few weeks . " " Where ? " " Reno . " There is a process that freezes foods instantly . It can not possibly work as fast as the chill which now shot through Harry , penetrating to the very marrow . " I am going to divorce Oscar , " she said. 146THE FLAG , BOYS ! " Now , now , now , now , now , now , now , now , " said Harry , his tongue flapping like a pennant . Angela laughed . " Do n't be frightened , poor dear , " she said , stroking his cheek . " You have no responsibility . You just happen to be the guy I fell in love with . It 's my own fault  --  all mine . There 's no need for you to feel any obligation whatsoever . " Oh , " said Harry , hearing distant noises of traps closing , nooses tightening , tumblers clicking shut . " I love you and I 'm stuck , " said Angela with a brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your own . " " Uh-huh , " said Harry . " Well , I guess I 'll be shovingoff . Big town meeting tonight . " " You sweet idiot ! " laughed Angela , placing herselfathwart him . " You sweet , sexy idiot ! " " Do n't be frightened , " said Angela , working on his buttons . " Do n't worry about a thing . " 14713 " TONIGHT , " said the Moderator , " I am going to step down and turn the meeting over to Lieutenant Guido di Maggio of the 99znd Anti-Aircraft Missile Battalion . " The Moderator left the platform and took a seat in the audience . Guido walked to the lectern . No applause greeted him . There was , in fact , an almost tangible emanation of hostility from the Assembly . Except for the di Maggio family and Maggie Larkin , sitting together in the back of the hall , not a friendly face could be seen . Guido was not dismayed . He had prepared himselfcarefully for tonight 's test , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , not smiling . " I know you people pretty good , and I know you were n't born yesterday . I 'm not going to try to con you with fancy speeches . You ask questions , I 'll give you straight answers . Okay , who 's first ? " 148RALLY ROUND THE FLAG , BOYS ! The Moderator rose . " It 's been a long time since I 've been on this side of the platform , so if nobody objects , I 'd like to get the ball rolling . Lieutenant , tell us why , with the whole countryside to choose from , the Army decided to put the Nike base smack in the middle of Putnam 's Landing . " We had to , " said Guido . We did n't want to , sir . We would have much preferred to pick some piece of land that nobody cared about . But you see , we 're part of a ring around Bridgeport  --  a group of batteriesthat protect Bridgeport no matter where an enemy attack might come from . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next one . You remove any one battery , you leave a great big hole in the defenses . " " Is n't it better to have a hole in the defenses , " asked Willard Beauchamp , " than to put nuclear warheads right in the center of a heavily populated residential area ? " " Let me set your mind at rest about one thing , " replied Guido . " It 's true the Defense Department has announced the development of a Nike with a nuclear warhead . But we will definitely not have them at Putnam 's Landing  --  not for several years at any rate . And when they do come  --  if they come  --  there will be adequate safeguards against radiation ... But that 's for the future ; right now all we 've got is standard , conventional missiles . " " Is n't that bad enough ? " asked Rodney O'Sheel . " High explosives , fuming acids  --  that 's hardly the kind of thing we want in our community . " " Sir , " replied Guido , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . All our explosives are stored deep underground . We have concrete bunkersand earthen walls eight feet thick around the fueling and firing areas . There is no danger whatsoeverof injuring any property around the Nike base . " " No ? " said Henry Steinberg . " How about the exhaustflames when you fire the Nike ? " " First of all , " said Guido , " the Nike is never fired except in the event of an enemy attack . There is no practice firing . . . I 'll repeat that . There is no practicefiring . The Nike will never be launched unless enemy planes are overhead  --  and if it is launched , there is a 500 foot safety zone around the launching site to take care of the exhaust flames . " The Moderator got up again . " All right , let 's say that there is an enemy attack and you have to launch a Nike . As I understand it , Nike is a two-stage rocket . The first stage goes after the target , while the booster falls back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booster from falling through somebody 's roof ? " " The Nike is fired in a fixed trajectory , " said Guido . " It is not aimed from the ground . We send it up to a pre-determined spot  --  in the case of Putnam'slanding , it will be somewhere over Long Island Sound  --  and then radar guides the missile to the target while the booster falls back into the Sound . " " What if the missile fails to hit the target and then goes flying around till it runs out of fuel ? " asked Willard Beauchamp . " Does n't it come crashingback to earth ? " 150THE FLAG , BOYS ! " No , " answered Guido . " If Nike runs out of fuel  --  or if it ever loses contact with radar control  --  it explodes itself automatically in the air . " Isaac Goodpasture rose and fixed Guido with a hard glare . " What you say is very impressive , young man . But I 've been digging back in some old newspaperfiles . Is n't it a fact that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off all by itself and crashed right in the middle of the Washington-Baltimore highway ? " " Yes , sir , it 's a fact , " admitted Guido promptly . " It 's a one-in-a-billion chance , but you 're right  --  it happened . But I 'll tell you two things : first , we 've taken elaborate precautions to see that such a thing can never happen again . Second , when that runawayNike landed on the Washington-Baltimore highway , it did not explode . A Nike will never explodeunless it is sent up by radar control . It is not a weapon that detonates on contact . So in the fantasticallyunlikely event that a Nike ever gets loose again , you can be sure it will land without exploding . " All right , " said George Melvin , realtor . " We 'll take your word for it that Nike is n't dangerous . But you ca n't tell me it 's not dangerous to property values . Here in Putnam 's Landing , we 've got some of the finest , most valuable real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves in with a big , ugly , noisy camp ? " " Sir , " said Guido , " I can assure you that propertyvalues will not suffer one bit . You will hardly know the Nike base is here . The buildings will be151RALLY ROUNDneat , low , and inconspicuous . We will landscape the base to blend with the surrounding countryside . We will only have one hundred troops . There will be no noise , no smoke , no fumes , and no dust . " David Coleman got up . " Okay , Lieutenant , so Nike is n't dangerous and it wo n't hurt real estate values . But what good is it ? I 've been talking to some of my friends in the Air Force , and they tell me Nike could n't hit the side of a barn . " " With all respect , sir , " said Guido , " I beg to differ . Nike is a very effective weapon . I saw it with my own eyes bring down a B-17 at Red Canyon , New Mexico . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what if the Russians do n't come in B-17s ? " " Nike can overtake and destroy any airplane in the world today  --  Russian , American or British  --  no matter what speed and altitude the airplane is flying at , " said Guido flatly . " What if the enemy plane stays out of range ? " asked David . " What if it comes to about one hundredmiles off the coast and sends in a guided bomb ? " " The Air Force is supposed to take care of enemy planes one hundred miles off the coast , " countered Guido . " All right , " said David . " What if the enemy sends an intercontinental ballistic missile ? " " Then we 're dead , " admitted Guido . " Look , sir , Nike does n't pretend to be anything but an anti-aircraftweapon , And it 's a good one , no matter what152THE FLAG , BOYS ! the Air Force says . Sure , there 'll be better missiles later , but meanwhile , Nike is ready . " " Why not wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why waste all that taxpayers ' money ? " " Because , sir , the enemy may not be willing to wait , " answered Guido . " And besides , as weapons go , it is n't all that expensive . A Nike base  --  complete with buildings , launchers , rockets , radar , everything  --  does not cost very much more than one single jet airplane . And if an enemy attacks , one jet is in the hands of one man and can make one pass  --  while a Nike base has a hundred men and can send up an unlimited number of rockets . " Laura Beauchamp rose . " Lieutenant , I must be blunt , " she said . " This is a quiet , homey village . Our daughters have been gently reared . What will happen to these pure , innocent girls when the town is full of soldiers ? " " Ma'am , " said Guido mildly , " are you under the impression that a boy turns into a sex fiend the minute he puts on a uniform ? Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Landing . Have they become rapists ? Of course not . Well , the kids who are coming here will be American boys , just like yours , from American homes , just like yours . If your daughters have been brought up properly  --  and I know they have  --  you have n't got a thing to worry about . " Laura Beauchamp sat down , and nobody else got up . Guido looked intently at his audience . Their153RALLY ROUNDfaces were no longer hostile ; they were thoughtful now , wavering , even abashed . He decided the time had come to make his move . " Folks , " he said with great sincerity , " I know how you feel . I 'm from Putnam 's Landing too , and I do n't like to see our town changed any more than you do . But , friends , our country has to be defended , and we all must do our bit . " And besides , " he continued , directing his glances at the merchants and tradesmen in the audience , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember , they make pretty good money , and they 've got nothing to do except spend it . Fatso , I 'll bet your diner will be doing more business than you ever dreamed of . Hank , you 'll be moving used cars that have been sitting on your lot for ten years . Sol , that movie palace of yours will stop looking like a haunted house every night . Mr. Melvin , a lot of the guys are married and they 'll be needing houses off the post . And , Mrs. Beauchamp , you can stop worryingabout those amateur theatricals of yours . If you need anything at all  --  actors , props , stagehands  --  just call me . " So what do you say , folks ? Will you make these kids welcome and show them that you 're good sports and good Americans ? I know it means sacrifices on your part , but think of the sacrifices the soldiers are making . They 're leaving their homes , their families , their schools , their girls . How will they feel if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How would your own kids feel ? Folks , listen to me . I154THE FLAG , BOYS ! grew up here , and I know you . You 're fine , decent , generous people . I 'm sure you 're going to open up your hearts to these lonesome American kids far away from home . . . Thank you . " Guido smiled sweetly at the audience , and suddenlyeverybody in the hall was smiling back . Then the applause began  --  a ripple at first , then a wave , then a thundering tide . Maggie Larkin bounced up and down in a transport of pride . Vittorio di Maggio turned in all directions , shouting , " Atsa my Guido ! Atsa my boy ! " Everybody rose and gave Guido a standing ovation . When order was restored , Grace Bannerman stepped forward . " Lieutenant , " she said , " I 'd like to thank you . I 'd like to thank you for giving us a clear and interesting description of Nike , but more than that , I 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fools , all of us  --  selfish , inconsiderate fools  --  and I think I speak for everybody here when I say that we are thoroughly ashamed . " Heads nodded agreement all over the hall . " And , " continued Grace , " I want to assure you , Lieutenant , that when the soldiers arrive , we will do our very best to make them feel at home  --  to make them a real part of our community ! " " Thank you , Mrs. Bannerman , " said Guido . " And now , as a citizen of this town , I think I 'm entitled to make a motion at this meeting , which I herewith do : I move that we appoint a Nike Hospitality Committee , and I nominate Mrs. Bannerman for chairman. 155RALLY ROUND THE FLAG , BOYS ! " Second the motion ! " cried Maggie Larkin . " Oh , no , no , no ! " said Grace hastily . " I could n't take the job . I have so many things already . " " Nonsense ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Aye ! " came a resounding cry . Grace flushed with pleasure . " All right , " she said , laughing . " My husband will kill me when he finds out , but thank you . I accept . " A mighty cheer was led by Maggie Larkin . " Move we adjourn , " said Manning Thaw , first selectman . " Oh , darn ! " cried Betty O'Sheel , plucking franticallyat Grace 's sleeve . " How about my garbage disposal plant ? " " Not tonight , dear , " said Grace . " Some other time . Okay ? " " But I 've waited so long , " complained Betty , bitingher lip . " Tell you what , " said Grace . " I 'll put you on my Nike Hospitality Committee . " " Well , all right , " said Betty , by no means mollified . " But when can I bring up the garbage ? " " Soon , " said Grace , " soon . " " Second , " said Isaac Goodpasture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Guido . " All in favor ? " " Aye , " said everybody . " The meeting , " said Guido , " is adjourned . " 15610 ' A GROUP of American boys sat in a troop train bound from Fort Bliss , Texas , to Putnam 's Landing , Connecticut . They were young  --  eighteen or nineteen , most of them  --  and their eyes were bright , and their bodies were fit , and as they sped to their new assignment in a faraway place , a sense of adventure filled all their stout young hearts , a single question gripped all their keen young minds . The question was voiced by Private William O. Wambess , a stalwart youth from Milwaukee , Wisconsin . " What , " he asked , are we going to do for broads in a jerkwater town like Putnam 's Landing ? " " Let 's face it : we 're dead , " said Private Roger Litwhiler , a broth of a lad from Boulder , Colorado . " It 's tough enough getting broads in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town  --  let 's face it , boys : we 're dead ! " " What a cruddy thing to do to us ! " said Private157RALLY ROUNDGustave Morrissette , a well-favored stripling from San Diego , California . " Sending us to a cruddy noactiondump like Putnam 's Landing ! " " Yeah , " said the others and sighed and shook their heads mournfully  --  all but one . He laughed out loud . His name was Corporal Opie Dalrymple , and his home was Altus , Oklahoma . He was eighteen years old , five feet eleven inches tall , and growing . His hair was a tumble of chestnut curls ; his face was fresh and full of wisdom . He sat now among his colleagues , sprawled comfortablyon his seat , his feet propped up on a barracksback in the aisle . Slung around his neck was a six-string Gibson guitar splendidly adorned with silver trimming , a picture of a palomino horse , and a legend in sequins : " MOTHER , I LOVE YOU . " He struck a chord on the guitar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chord again , and nodded with satisfaction . Then he looked up at the distressed faces of his fellows and once more laughed out loud . " What are you laughing at ? " said Private William O. Wambess resentfully . " I do n't think it 's very funny  --  getting stuck in a hick town with no dames . " " Frinds , " said Opie in accents that recalled hominygrits and sidemeat , " lemme tell you about hick towns . Ah ben in Nyawk , Nawlins , St. Louis , Chicago , and Hollywood , and Ah tell you the mortal truth , mah finds , you 'll find more poon per square inch in hick towns than in any big city on God 's green earth ! " 158THE FLAG , BOYS ! " Yeah ? " said the others , crowding eagerly around Opie . " It 's a fack , " Opie assured them . " You take a big city gal now . Night-time comes , she 's got thangs to do , places to go . But you take a little ole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do at night : Ah mean poon . " " Maybe down where you come from , " said PrivateRoger Litwhiler . " But we 're heading for New England . " " Country 's country , " said Opie flatly . " Ah ben pickin ' and sangin ' all over these United States  --  north , south , east , and west  --  yeah , and Canada too  --  and wherever I ben , them little ole country gals all had the same thang on their mind . " " Poon ? " asked Private Gustave Morrissette hopefully . " Poon , " affirmed Opie . The young warriors , much heartened , returned to their seats . In the months of basic training , they had come to know that Opie was a man to be trusted . Here was no ordinary G.I. ; here was a man broadenedby travel , richened by experience , sharpened by show business  --  a man who , had not the Army nabbed him in mid-career , would surely today be a star of the magnitude of Ferlin Husky  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of fact , Mr. Tubb who first put Opie 's feet on the steep , hard path to stardom . Mr. Tubb and a troupe of supporting artists gave a recital one evening in Altus , Oklahoma , and159RALLY ROUNDOpie , then six years old , was taken along by his mama and daddy . It was his first look at country music , and the effect was overwhelming . He sat through the concert as if in a trance , bulge-eyed and open-jawed . Only his little foot moved , solemnly beating time , and occasionally his tiny fingers twitched at the strings of an imaginary guitar . At the end of the show his mama and daddy , in the friendly manner of country folk , went up to tell Mr. Tubb what a heap of enjoyment he had given them . Opie , hiding behind his mother 's skirt , suddenlyfound courage , emerged from the dirndl , plucked at the white leather fringe on Mr. Tubb 's handsome red and yellow cowboy jacket , and asked in a quavering but determined treble , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stor like you ? " " Now , do n't you bother Mr. Tubb , " said Opie 's daddy , fetching Opie a smart clout in the ear . " Shucks , folks , Ah do n't mind , " said Mr. Tubb with a kindly chuckle . He tousled Opie 's chestnut curls . " So you want to be a big stor , do you ? " he asked . " Yes , sir , " said Opie fervently . " Well , boy , here 's what you got to do , " said Mr. Tubb . He laid his hand over his cardiac region . " You got to sang from the hort , boy , you got to sang from the hort ! " Opie never forgot this fine advice . Whenever he sang , it was from the heart  --  direct from his heart to the hearts of the audience ... But , of course , it was many years before he had an audience . In fact , it was many years before he even had a guitar . Opie's160THE FLAG , BOYS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not of a mind to encourage Opie 's artistic aspirations . There were , after all , 15 acres of unbounteous red dirt to farm , and only one son in the house . But Opie 's mama , watching the boy sitting transfixed by the radio each night listening to the country disk jockeys , was filled with pity and saved her egg money and on Opie 's tenth birthday presented him with his very own Gibson guitar . It can not be said that Opie taught himself to play the guitar . The fact is , he never had to learn at all . The guitar was placed in his hands , and he straightawayran off eighteen choruses of My Bucket 's Got a Hole in It . It was scarcely a month later that Opie wrote his first song . Standing in the half-filled silo where the acoustics provided a pleasant echo , he picked and sang a little ditty entitled You Lied to Me Oncet Too Often . It went like this : You lied to me oncet too often , You broke off a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , You thought you was awful smort . You lied to me oncet too often , Muh love , it made you laugh , You near put me in a coffin , You branded me like a calf . You lied to me oncet too often , You never thought no more of me , Than a dirty old pig in a trough an ' The fishes in the sea. 161IRALLY ROUND You lied to me oncet too often , And now Ah hate yore guts , Ah may be weak and coughin ' , But Ah ai n't completely nuts , Though Opie , at age ten , had no intimate ac- quaintance with the sorrows of love , he did sing his song from the heart , and his mama allowed that it was right pretty . His daddy was less impressed . " You keep out of that goddam silo , hear ? " he said . But Opie returned to the silo at every opportunity . In the next six years in addition to going to school , milking , plowing , planting , haying , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including On the Banks of the Fort Supply Reser- voir ; Red Eye Whisky Is My Buckler , but the Bible Is My Shield ; Daughter 's Gone to Dallas , a Car-Hop for to Be ; and Dear God , I 'm Glad You Took My Ethel , She Was Much Too Good for Me . Opie picked and sang his songs ( from the heart ) at dances , hoe-downs , barn raisings , and all other fiestas around Altus , Oklahoma , and the folks en- joyed them mightily , but no talent scouts came through town , and he finally decided that since fame was not coming after him , he would have to go after it . On his sixteenth birthday while his mama wept and his daddy hit him with an ax handle , he took off for Oklahoma City to seek his fortune . In the metropolis Opie discovered that he was not the only prodigy who had come boiling out of the hills . The waiting rooms of the radio stations were jammed with hundreds of guitar-slung young men , each with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the heart , each clawing for a chance to be heard . But Opie persisted and after several hungry months got an audition . The station manager and the station manager 's assistant listened and looked at one another and nodded wisely . No doubt about it : this boy had the stuff  --  the twang , the whine , the heart . From this point Opie 's rise , if not meteoric , was certain and steady . He played around Oklahoma City for a while , then moved on to the other country music centers  --  Little Rock , Shreveport , Richmondandfinally he received the accolade : a booking at the Grand Old Opry in Nashville , which is to country music what the Palace was to old time vaudeville . In Nashville , Opie was truly initiated into the country music business  --  a fabulous business which accounts for forty percent of all phonograph record sales in the United States ; a business whose starspeoplelike Ernest Tubb , Ferlin Husky , Red Foley , Carl Smith , Webb Pierce  --  are almost unknown in New York and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars and more every year ; a business where every performer composes his own songs and then delivers them to the publishing house on a tape recording because not one of them can read or write music ; a business where everybody drives a Cadillac , not for reasons of ostentation , but because it is quite common on tour to travel five , six , and seven hundred miles in a single day . Opie 's first tour ( he got fifth billing in a troupe 163RALLY ROUND of five ) took him north from Louisiana to the Da- kotas , then into Canada to Winnipeg , Calgary , and Edmonton , then down to Bozeman , Montana , west to the State of Washington , south to California , and east through Arizona , New Mexico , and Texas . In all , he sang from his heart in forty-five towns , and in each of them the audience response was im- mensely gratifying . Particularly the response from the girls in the audience . Young female fans of country music are not to be confused with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who used to mob the Paramount to hear Frank Sinatra were filled with adulation to be sure , but adulation was all they had . Frankie to them was a star and , like a star , distant and unattainable ; the best they could hope for was a shred of his clothing . But the girls at country concerts feel no such separation between themselves and the performers . That boy up on the stage singing to them from his heart is clearly country , even as they are , and they find it not at all unthinkable that he might be available for some close work after the show . Opie did a sight of close work on his tour , all of which he thoroughly enjoyed , and he wrote a few new songs  --  not more than two or three hundred  --  and then he came back to Nashville , bought himself a sky-blue Cadillac , made a second appearance on Grand Old Opry , recorded some songs , and left on another tour ( third billing in a troupe of five this time ) which took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then back through New York State , Pennsylvania , and Ohio . A notice from the draft board followed him all through this tour but did not catch up with him until he was back in Nashville . It could not have been more untimely , coming as it did when he was just beginning to get a foothold in country music , but it never occurred to Opie to ask for a postponement . Instead he got magnificently drunk and in the morningsent off his Cadillac to his daddy and reported quietly for military service . There was a tiny bit of trouble during his first days in the Army . His barracks mates had some things to say about his sideburns , his buckskin fringed suits , and his guitar , all of which Opie bore with sweet patience until it became clear that direct measures were indicated . Then he cold-cocked his two principal tormentors with a short left and a short right respectively , and the ragging stopped . Looking at Opie with new eyes  --  especially after his cowboy duds had been traded for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sideburns  --  theboys in the barracks began to see that he was no rustic pantaloon , but a man of considerableparts . He was friendly , agreeable , and intelligent ; he was no stranger to the world ; he could drop a man with either his right or left hand ; and he sang from the heart . The mantle of leadership fell naturally upon Opie 's shoulders , and he wore it with the lordly unconcern of the born commander . The company165RALLY ROUND THE FLAG , BOYS ! NCO 's , also aware of Opie 's quality , quickly promotedhim to acting corporal . When the company was detailed to Putnam 's Landing , the designation was made official . Now Corporal Opie Dalrymple sat easily on the troop train clacking north by east and rested his feet on a barracks bag and struck soft chords on his guitar . He was content . He did not look back and curse the fate that had cut off a career full of bright promise ; nor did he look forward with dismay to two years ' duty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Country 's country , " he had said , and he felt with a serenity based on accomplishment that no man need go loveless . As he sat and anticipated a rich , full life in Putnam'sLanding , his muse , never distant , lighted on his shoulder and moved him to composition . From the heart he sang and picked the following : Ah 'm a long gone soldier in a faraway land , And muh load of grief is great , But if you 'll let me hold yore dear little hand , Ah 'll be at Heaven 's gate. 16615 " DADDY-O , " said soft young Comfort Goodpasture to her hard old father Isaac , " what are you doing ? " " I am trying to write an editorial , " replied Isaac , " and you do not lighten my task by humming Love Me Tender and rasping your fingernails . Is it possible that you might do those things in your own room ? " " But I want to talk to you , " said Comfort . " You do ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long year since such a request had come from Comfort . " Is there anything wrong ? " " There certainly is ! " declared Comfort . " Daddy-O , something awful is happening to me  --  something to do with sex . " " I knew it ! " cried Isaac , going white . " I knew it was only a matter of time ! " " Oh , relax ! It 's not anything like that . It 's just emotional . " 167RALLY ROUND " Glory be to God ! " breathed Isaac , his color returning . " Well , it 's nothing to celebrate , " said Comfort resentfully " I mean this thing has really got me bugged . " " Bugged , " said Isaac , " is , I think , not an unusual condition for you . " " Not this bugged , " she insisted . " Daddy-O , listen . Something weird has happened . All of a sudden , I like boys . I do n't just like ' em ; I mean I go ape when I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Isaac . " And when did this trans- formation take place ? " " I do n't know . Three or four weeks ago , I guess . I first noticed it the night Grady Metcalf came around with his motorcycle . You see , his fossils promised him a motorcycle on his eighteenth birth- day if he passed math , and --  " " By fossils , " interrupted Isaac , " I presume you mean parents ? " " What else ? " said Comfort . " Well , anyhow --  " " Excuse me , " said Isaac , interrupting again . " Am I to understand that Grady Metcalf passed math ? " " Weirdsville , ai n't it ? " said Comfort . " It is indeed , " he agreed . " Yeh , " said Comfort . " Well , anyhow , Grady Met- calf , who is one of the really big meatballs of our generation and I hate him like poison , he took me out riding on his motorcycle , and you know what ? All of a sudden , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what else ? When I saw him in school the next day , he looked even better ! " 168 " Weirdsville , " said Isaac solemnly . " But that 's not the worst of it ! " cried Comfort . " All the boys looked good to me ! I mean I went down the hall and saw twerps and gropers that I would just as soon step on ' em as look at ' em , and suddenly they did n't seem so bad after all . In fact , lately there 's not more than fifteen or twenty boys in the whole school that I ca n't stand . " " Tell me , " said Isaac nervously , " this new outlookof yours  --  has it made you , shall we say , more tractable ? " " Oh , do n't worry , Daddy-O . I have n't done anything . They still call me The Iron Maiden ' at school ... But I 'll tell you the truth , Daddy-O : when I cope these days , my heart is n't really in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cope ? " asked Isaac hopefully . " I do , " sighed Comfort . " But it seems less importantall the time . . . And that 's what bugs me , Daddy-O . Why do I feel this way ? " Isaac was suddenly touched to the depths of his craggy heart . He rose from his desk , walked over to Comfort , and laid an awkward hand on her shoulder . " Comfort , child , " he said softly , " if the Good Lord in His wisdom had not seen fit to take your mother , perhaps she could answer you . All I can say is no matter how bewildering it all seems , it is quite natural , and soon everything will be in order again . " Grand ! " said Comfort unhappily . " What do I do in the meantime ? " " In the meantime , " answered Isaac , " you 've got 169RALLY ROUNDthree hundred years of Puritan blood in your veins . Listen to it . " The Putnam 's Landing chapter of the Dean-PresleySchool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fatso 's Diner . Here , starting at seven in the evening , they would stand beside their hybrid automobiles , tilt their pelvises , hug their elbows , smoke cigarettes , tell lies about their sex life , and spit . After a while they would go inside the diner , drink cokes , lean on the juke box and play Fats Domino , the Clef Tones , and , of course , Elvis . Toward midnight they would go home , where , duringtheir absence , their fathers and mothers had been arguing violently , each mother contending that there was nothing wrong with the boy , he was just passing through a phase , and each father insisting that a good belt on the side of the head would send him through the phase a hell of a lot faster . As the boy slouched into the house , the mother would approach him with a sweet , propitiatory smile and say , " Would you like a glass of milk before you go to bed , dear ? " By way of reply he would snarl , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and lurch up to his bedroom while the mother bodily prevented the father from going after him and fracturing his skull . Thus passed a typical evening of a typical New Delinquent  --  spitting , loitering , and addling his parents . No gas stations got held up , no stores got burgled , no citizens got mugged , no blood got spilled . And no girls got ruined . The sex life of the New170THE FLAG , BOYS ! Delinquent was wholly conversational . On week nights they had no dates at all ; on Fridays and Saturdaysthey drove the local girls to dark places and made out . " Making out " was nothing more than what used to be called necking or petting . This activity , as older readers will recall , covered a good deal of territory , but always stopped short of fulfillment . The New Delinquents were in their hearts as scared of real sex as they were of real larceny . Now on this night , while Comfort Goodpasture was having a heart-to-heart talk with her father , four New Delinquents were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking lot of Fatso 's Diner . Each wore a ducktail haircut and long , greasy sideburns , each held a king-size cigarette in his mouth , each was seventeen years old . They stood , this quartet of rebels-without-causes , these victims of the Zeitgeist , and made the followingconversation : " What 's the scoop for tonight ? " said the one called Wally . " Same as last night  --  nothin ' , " said the one called Ed . " Lousy burg is a lousy morgue , " said the one called Charlie . " Kee-rap , " said the one called Fred . All spat . " They ought to have a youth center in this burg , " said Wally , " where a guy could pick up some tail . " " I could use some , " said Ed . " It 's been more'n a week . " " Kee-rap , " said Fred. 171RALLY ROUND " No , honest , " said Ed . " Remember when my old lady took me to New York to see this head-shrinker ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm walkin ' down Fifth Avenue when I notice this dame givin ' me the eye . She 's about 35 , see , but she 's still plenty good lookin ' . So I just fall in step right next to her , and she do n't say boo . She turns the corner , I turn with her . She goes into a hotel , I go right along . She do n't say a word , see ? So finally we get up to her room , and she lets me in and locks the door . Then she rips her clothes off , and of course I rip mine off too , and she drags me to the bed , and , man , we went the whole route ! " " Kee-rap , " said Fred . " No , honest ! " Ed insisted . " Okay , let 's drive to New York and get her , " said Charlie . " We ca n't , hey , " said Ed . " I mean I promised her I 'd never come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word ever got out about this , she 'd be ruined with the Four Hundred . " " Kee-rap , " said the other three . They stood for a while expectorating morosely . Then Grady Metcalf roared into the lot on his big black Harley , and joy abruptly replaced dolor . They all broke into happy smiles and rushed to greet him . Grady had always been their leader , but lately two developments had solidified his position . First , the motorcycle . Second , now that he was eighteen , he had a draft card and could therefore buy beer across the New York State line . " Grady , whaddya say ? What 's up ? How ya172THE FLAG , BOYS ! makin ' ? " they cried , looking admiringly at this fine figure of a man in black denim trousers and motorcycleboots and a black leather jacket with an eagle on the back . Grady regarded them coldly through half-closed Presley-style eyelids , not replying , showing the disdainthat became his station . He took out a cigarette , clicked a kitchen match on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How 's the bike runnin ' , Grady ? " asked Wally , laying a respectful hand on the flank of the Harley . Grady deigned to speak . " Cuttin ' out a little in third , " he replied . " Havin ' some trouble speedshiftin ' . Could be a plug . " The others listened in devout silence , as young seminarians to a bishop . " But otherwise she 's going pretty smooth , " continuedGrady . " Had her up to 97 last night . " " Kee-rist ! " said the others , awed . Pleased by the response , Grady unbent a trifle . " What are you cats up to tonight ? " " Same as last night  --  nothin ' , " said Ed . " Lousy burg is a lousy morgue , " said Charlie . " Kee-rap , " said Fred . " Hey , Grady , how about hittin ' for New York State ? " suggested Wally . " Sure ! " agreed Ed enthusiastically . " Let 's go over to Beer Can Boulevard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grady . " Well , then , how about we cruise around and see if we can find some tail ? " said Charlie . " Good idea , " said Grady . " You do that . " 173RALLY ROUND " How about you ? " asked Fred . " I got mine , " replied Grady . They looked at him with delight and admiration . " Yeh , Grady ? " asked Wally . " You on the scheme tonight ? " " That 's right , " he admitted . " Who is she ? " they asked as one man . " Comfort Goodpasture , " he answered . Their faces fell . " Aw , Grady , " said Charlie , " what for ? You got this beautiful bike . You could pick up any broad in town . Why keep wastin ' time on The Iron Maiden ? " " That 's right , Grady , " said Wally . " Why knock yourself out for nothin ' ? Nobody 's ever made out with Comfort . " " Until tonight , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Fred . " She 's ready , " replied Grady . " I feel it in my bones : she 's ready ! " With this positive pronouncement , he kicked the starter on his Harley and blasted off . His disciples looked after him pensively . " If anybody can do it , " said Ed , " it 's Grady . " " Yeah , " said Fred . " But nobody can do it . " Isaac Goodpasture had long ago learned that when a widower like himself raises a teen-age daughter like Comfort , the only possible principle to employ is laissez faire . Let her go where she wants , and depend on Providence and Yankee genes to bring her home intact . But now as he stood at the window of his study 174THE FLAG , BOYS ! and watched her roaring away on the back of Grady Metcalf 's motorcycle , her hair flying , her cheek flattened against Grady 's leather jacket , Isaac wonderedglumly whether the time had not come to drop laissez faire and try a set of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would only make her wilder . Gentle suasion was the only answer  --  that and sneaking out on some moonless night and slashing Grady 's tires . He left the window and returned to his desk , resolutely putting thoughts of Comfort from his mind . He had a job to do  --  a job that had been thwarting his best efforts for many days . The following week Putnam 's Landing was celebrating " Welcome Nike Day " and it was Isaac 's task now to write an appropriately hospitable editorial for the Gazette . But Isaac could not think of one solitary reason to welcome Nike . For a man who had dedicated his life to preserving the status quo in Putnam 's Landing , the arrival of Nike was a pure calamity . Nor had he been comforted by Guido di Maggio 's assurancesat the town meeting . High explosives were high explosives , and soldiers were soldiers , and no amount of talk could convince Isaac that these two elements would fit snugly into the rustic pattern of Putnam 's Landing . Still , Nike was a fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpatriotic  --  to rail against it now . There was nothing for it but to cast his mind about until he found some aspect , some angle , that would give him a properly cordial editorial. 175RALLY ROUND So he sat and thought and cast . At last he found what he was looking for , and he wrote the following : To the o f Dicers and men o f the Nike base , the Put- nam 's Landing Gazette extends a hearty welcome . We hope you will be content here . To those residents of Putnam 's Landing who look upon the arrival of Nike with something less than delight , we offer this consolation : Nike has pre- empted for its use ioo acres of Johnnycake Hill . If Nike had not come along and taken this land , it is certain that some developer would have grabbed it and constructed ' , Do houses on the site . It is fair to estimate that the houses would have cost about $30,000 apiece , which means that property taxes accruing to the town from each house would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mourn the loss of this revenue , let us consider another aspect . These new houses would have all been sold to commuters , who , as we have noted with no little dismay , proliferate like rabbits . It can not be doubted that a minimum o f three children would be born in each house  --  chil- dren who would have to be educated in our public schools at a cost of $635 per head per year , thus burdening the town with a net annual loss of $1425 on each house ! So we say , Welcome , Nike ! And if the Air Force and the Navy would also like to come in , Welcome to them too ! Comfort and Grady sat on a bench at Tall Wal- 176 nuts with the motorcycle parked nearby . There were stars in Comfort 's eyes , warmth in her bosom . She could still feel the smash of the wind , the roar of the exhaust , the road spinning dizzily underneath . Grady , pretending casualness , reached over and picked up her hand . She disengaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said pleasantly , " and I 'll put you in the hospital . " " Tell me somethin ' , hey , " he asked . " What you got against a little makin ' out ? " " I just do n't like people slobbering all over me , that 's all . " " I do n't slobber , " he said . " I 'll show you . " He gave her a quick , neat , unexpected kiss which , to her immense surprise , she found she was thoroughlyglad to have had . " Was that bad ? " he asked . She shook her head dumbly , her eyes wide with wonder . " Come here . " Without volition , it seemed , she slid closer to him . He raised her head to kiss position and fell to work truly and well . She relaxed in his embrace , all but her right hand , which swung in a shgrt , savage arc and slammed into the back of his neck . He sprang away , howling with pain . " Gee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , genuinely contrite . " What was that for ? " he complained . " I thought you liked kissing . " " Oh , I do , " she assured him . " Kissing is wonderful ! It 's you I ca n't stand . " 177RALLY ROUND " Thanks a lot , " he mumbled huffily . " Maybe you better take me home , " said Comfort . " Maybe I better . " Silently they mounted the Harley . Again , as they sped home , the good , wild , free feeling returned to Comfort . She hugged Grady tight , rubbed her cheek happily into his back , laughed with delight as they careened around corners . They pulled up in front of Comfort 's house . Grady helped her off , walked her to the door . " Well , so long , " he said , offering her a tentative hand to shake . " Do n't you want to kiss me goodnight ? " she asked . " Do you think I 'm nuts ? " he replied with feeling . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Anyhow , I do n't think I will . " " Well , I do n't know --  " " Come on . " She turned her lips upward . Apprehensively he bent over and gave her a minimal kiss . When , however , no blows seemed to be coming , he increased the pressure . " Ah ! " she said , coming out of the clinch . " That was keen ! " Grady narrowed his half-drawn eyelids . " I do n't dig you , " he confessed . " I do n't dig myself , " replied Comfort truthfully . " Want another kiss ? " " Better not , " she said . " I 'm almost sure I 'll hit you this time . " 178THE FLAG , BOYS ! Grady scratched his head for a moment . " Well , goodnight , " he said . " Goodnight . " He walked toward his bike . He turned . " Hey , will you go out with me again ? " " No , " she replied promptly . " Why not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So how come you kissed me ? " She shrugged . " You answer that one , chum , and you win the turkey . " He scratched his head some more . " Maybe I 'll come around tomorrow . Okay ? " " Okay , " said Comfort . He stared at her in total confusion . " You are the weirdest ! " he said . She nodded . " Yeah . . . Goodnight . " " Goodnight . " Thoughtfully they went their separate ways  --  Comfort up to her room to lie open-eyed on her bed while her antique blood went a few rounds with her contemporary endocrines ; Grady home on his motorcycle , feeling like a combination of Raffles and Pandora . He had managed to open the locked box all right , but , Kee-rist , what a mess of trouble had come flying out ! And yet , thought Grady as he rode , he had succeeded . Where every other expert at Webster High had failed , he had clearly scored . Sure , she was cuckoo and treacherous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had kissed her and he had been179RALLY ROUND THE FLAG , BOYS ! kissed back , and who else could make that state- ment ? Pride warmed his wind-whipped breast . It was no small thing to be the first victor over an adver- sary so formidable . She was Everest , and he was Tenzing , and this was no night to be slinking home , this was a night to celebrate ! He braked the bike , spun it around , and headed for Fatso 's Diner to share his triumph with his loyal liegemen . They came running when Grady roared into the parking lot . " Well ? " they cried eagerly . " Well ? Well ? " " I 'll give it to you in one word , " said Grady . " Jackpot ! " A cheer rose from their throats . They shook his hand and pounded his back and tousled his hair . " Kee-rap , " said Grady , concealing his pleasure . " Come on . Let 's hit for Beer Can Boulevard . " He gunned his bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and followed . " You know what he is ? " said Ed as they rode . " Grady ? " said Charlie . " Yeah , " said Ed . " What ? " said Fred . " An inspiration to us all , " said Ed . They nodded in solemn agreement and followed the big red tail-light on the big black Harley. 16THE day was Tuesday , the time was fifteen minutes past noon , and the place was Oscar Hoffa 's office . Oscar sat behind his desk mangling an Upmann . Seated in front of his desk were a half-dozen advertising agency executives , all dressed in the funerealblack that passes for chic on Madison Avenue . Oscar , who had a very tiny attention span for advertisingexecutives , had not caught their names when they came in . He had a vague impression they were all called Dub Hotchkiss , and , indeed , they all seemed to answer to that name . The topic of today 's meeting was a television serial entitled David and Bathsheba , a biblical romancefilled with action , passion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm the heart of any sponsor . Yet the sponsor , the **27;10769;TOOLONG , was far from satisfied . In spite of the mounting popularity of David and Bathsheba , the sales of Crackle-Crunchies were181RALLY ROUNDshowing no increase whatsoever , and , in fact , were declining sharply in some areas . To solve this paradoxthe agency executives were this day solemnly assembled . " Just talking off the top of my head , of course , " said the first Dub Hotchkiss , " but I think the kazoo here is product identification . This is only woodshedresearch , but my antenna tells me the publicdoes n't identify King David with Crackle-Crunchies . " " Right ! " said the second Dub Hotchkiss . " Now we 're getting down to where the rubber meets the road . Identification ! That 's the gizmo ! Somehow we 've got to tie up Crackle-Crunchies with King David . " " Well , " said the third Dub Hotchkiss . " I 've got a kind of crazy , off-beat idea . In fact , it 's so far out in left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up . " " Nonsense , laddie , " said the fourth Dub Hotchkiss . " Run it up the mast , and let 's see if anybody salutes . " " All right then , " said the third Dub Hotchkiss . " To get down to the short strokes , what I have in mind is a time machine . Every once in a while we put King David in the time machine and he pops into the twentieth century and has himself a bowl of Crackle-Crunchies . " " I do n't know , " said the fifth Dub Hotchkiss doubtfully . " We may be opening up a can of beans here . What do you think , Oscar ? " Oscar grunted . He had long ago learned to close his mind tight at meetings with agency people. 182THE FLAG , BOYS ! Today it was especially easy , because today his mind was occupied by another topic : his wife Angela . Or  --  more properly  --  his ex-wife Angela . Angela had come back from Reno five days earlier with her divorce , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had been happy enough to see her go . " Good riddance ! " he had cried with characteristic gallantry . He had left her the Putnam 's Landing house and moved into New York , thus cutting two hated hours of commuting from his day . He had worked as late as he liked , gotten up whenever he felt like it , kept television sets blaring in every room , answered to nobody for anything , and been better-tempered than he had been in years . But all the time he had clung secretlyto a conviction that Angela would abandon the notion of a divorce before the six weeks were up and come slinking home for forgiveness . But she had not . She had returned a free woman , and Oscar was filled with unaccustomed aches in unused regions . His pride hurt , and so did his heart , and even his conscience was stirring sluggishly . Not that he wanted Angela back ; he recognized that a man like himself was far better off alone . But still he could not help wondering what had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what was in store for Angela now . " Gentlemen , " said the sixth Dub Hotchkiss , " hand me my cross-cut saw ; I 'm going out on a limb . I am flatly against the time machine . It seems to me we 're rooting around on the ground for acorns when we should be looking up to see where they 're com-183RALLY ROUND ing from . What 's the biggest plus we 've got on this program ? I 'll tell you , gentlemen : it 's God ! We 've established a fine , warm rapport between David and God over the last few weeks . Now , why ca n't we  --  reverently , of course  --  have God bring him a bowl of Crackle-Crunchies in a vision ? " " Too full of wrinkles , " said the first Dub Hotch- kiss , shaking his head gravely . " Some of those re- ligious nuts might hop on it . Do n't you think so , Oscar ? " Oscar grunted again . There had to be a guy , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get divorced unless there was a guy waiting somewhere . She was much too smart for such a bonehead play . But who was the guy ? Where was he ? And what did he have that Oscar did n't ? The intercom buzzed on Oscar 's desk . " Yeah ? " he snapped , pushing down the key . " Mr. Stronghold on the phone , " said his secretary . Oscar , hardly a man for idle speculation , had not merely sat around and wondered who Angela 's guy might be ; he had engaged one Albert Stronghold , private investigator , to shadow Angela as soon as she got back from Reno . So far there had been no results , but this call , thought Oscar with a flutter of excitement , could be the jackpot . " Yeah ? " he said into the phone . " Subject left Putnam 's Landing on the 10:07 train this morning , " said Mr. Stronghold . " Subject reg- istered at the Plaza Hotel at 11:54 , checked into Room 921 . Man came to Room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Man is tall , in midthirties , wearing tan topcoat and gray flannel suit , looked nervous , no distinguishing marks . " " Right ! " cried Oscar jubilantly and banged down the phone . " Dub , " he said collectively , " you guys mother-hen it , house-break it , pressure cook it , cross-pollinate it , blue-sky it , unglue it , run it down , and wrap it up . I 'll see you around . " " But what about our problem ? " cried the second Dub Hotchkiss in dismay . " How do we identify King David with Crackle-Crunchies ? " " Simple , " said Oscar . " King David invents Crackle-Crunchies himself , see ? But it 's such a great delicacy that he do n't want the common people to have it , so he keeps the formula a secret . When he dies , the formula is lost , and we do n't find it till 5000 years later . " " Where do we find it ? " asked the third Dub Hotchkiss . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else ? " All the Dub Hotchkisses looked at him with admirationbordering on awe . " A barn-burner ! " said one . " This has protein ! " said another . " This sings ! " said a third . " Yeah , " said Oscar . " Well , so long , Dub . " He leaped up from his desk and raced out of the office . A tall man in his mid-thirties , wearing a tan top-185RALLY ROUNDcoat and a gray flannel suit , looking nervous , and bearing no distinguishing marks , raised his knuckles to rap on the door of Room 921 of the Plaza Hotel , and then changed his mind and stuck his hand in his pocket . Twice more he took out his hand , lifted it , and put it away again . At length he shrugged and sighed and rapped . The door opened instantly . " Harry ! " cried Angela Hoffa . " Harry , darling ! " " Hello , Angela , " said Harry with a faint smile . He extended his hand for a handshake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Angela jocularly . She took his hand , pulled him into the room , swung the door shut . " Take off your coat . " " No , thanks , Angela . I ca n't stay . " " Nonsense ! " she said , moving around behind him and de-coating him deftly . " Honest , Angela , I 've got to be going . " " Oh , do n't be a goose . " She picked up the phone . " Room service . . . This is Mrs. Hoffa in 921 . Will you please send up a bottle of White Label and some ice ? . . . Thank you . " " Angela , thanks a lot , but I really do n't care for a drink . " " I do , " she said mildly . " Do you mind ? " " Sorry , " he said . " Now , Angela , I agreed to meet you here today because  --  " Angela gripped Harry by both arms and looked him full in the face . " Harry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throbbing with earnestness . " Fine , " he answered . " Now , as I was saying --  " " Are n't you going to ask how I am ? " she said , 186THE FLAG , BOYS ! gently reproachful . " After all , it 's been seven weeks since you laid eyes on me . " " I 'm sorry , Angela , " he said contritely . " How are you ? " " That 's better , " she said with an approving nod . " I 'm just dandy , thank you . " " I 'm glad . Now , Angela --  " " Do n't you want to ask me how Reno was ? " " All right , " said Harry . " How was Reno ? " " It was hot and dry , and they pay io to i oneight the hard way . " " I hope you won a lot of money , " he said politely . " Nope , " sighed Angela . " I 'm only lucky in love . " Harry quickly moved a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say what I came to say ? " " In a minute . How 's Grace ? " " Grace ? She 's fine , thanks . " " Do you ever see her ? " " What ? " said Harry , taken aback . " Of course I see her . Why ? " " Look , pal , I got back to Putnam 's Landing almost a week ago and I 've been hearing about nothing except the Nike Hospitality Committee . Day and night , is n't it ? " " Well , " he said cautiously , " it does keep Grace pretty busy . " " You poor darling ! " said Angela , giving Harry a compassionate look . " Me ? It 's Grace who does all the work . " " While you stand by , poor lamb , and wonder what ever became of the girl you married . " " Angela , will you tell me something ? " asked187RALLY ROUNDHarry earnestly . " Why do you keep after me ? Have n't you got enough trouble ? " " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use . " " Well then , why should n't we comfort each other ? " " Comfort ? I ca n't face my wife . I ca n't face you . I ca n't face myself . You call that comfort ? " You poor lamb ! " " I am not a poor lamb . What I am is a snake .. . Or a rat . . . Or a skunk . . . I 'm here to tell you we 're through . I 'm sorry you went to Reno on my account . I 'm sorry about everything  --  sorry as hell . . . But we 're through . " " All right , darling . If we 're through , we 're through . But why such a long face ? Let 's keep it light . That 's the way we started and that 's the way we end . " " Oh , no ! None of that ! Please , none of that ! Spare me the good-sport bit . If you 've got a little pearl handled revolver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But let 's not have any smiling through tears . I ca n't stand it ! " " You have got a conscience , have n't you , poor darling ? " " I have . " " Poor darling ! " " And it 's nothing we can repair by getting in bed again  --  in case that 's what you 're thinking of . " " As a matter of fact , it had crossed my mind . " " What for ? There 's no future in it . " 188THE FLAG , BOYS ( " As a goodbye , then . As a proper goodbye . " " Angela , for God 's sake , what do you want with me ? I 'm a louse . What 's more , I 'm a married louse ... And the lousier I get , the more married I am . Do n't you understand that ? " " You 're not a louse , darling . You 're just a poor , trapped , unhappy man . Why wo n't you let me help you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . . . Here . Here 's my hand . Give it a brisk shake , and then I 'll take off while you sit here and thank your lucky stars you 've seen the last of me . " She took his extended hand , slipped deftly inside his arm , pressed her soft , fragrant body against his , found his lips . Suddenly there came a loud pounding on the door . " Oh , my God ! " quavered Harry , visions of house detectives dancing through his brain . " Relax ! " laughed Angela . " It 's room service . " " Pretty loud knock for room service , " said Harry , not comforted . She kissed him lightly . " You 're a worrier , " she said . She went to the door and opened it , and in came Oscar Hoffa like a wolf on the fold . He ran over to Harry and looked at him with wild , total incredulity . " Oh , no ! " he howled . " Oh , no ! Notyou ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " demandedAngela , her eyes crackling with wrath . Oscar , unheeding , continued to gape at Harry. 189RALLY ROUND " Harry Bannerman , for Christ 's sake ! " he cried , smacking his forehead with the heel of his hand . " Oh , for Christ 's sweet sake ! " " I 'm asking you , Oscar , " said Angela . " What do you want here ? " " Okay , okay , " said Oscar to Angela . " Do n't get a hemorrhage . I 'm not looking for revenge . I 'm not sore at nobody . I did n't come to make trouble .. . But I do think I 'm entitled to see the guy who took you away from me . " He looked again at Harry and shook his head in pained disbelief . " Harry Bannerman , for Christ 's sake ! " " I 'm not exactly sure of my rights in this situation , " said Harry to Oscar , " but I ca n't say that I like your tone . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's just that I always had you pegged for a hearth and home type . I 'm sorry . " " That 's okay , " said Harry . " It 's a natural mistake . " " But I still do n't figure you with Angela , " Oscar continued . " You ai n't in love with her or anything like that ? " " Let 's drop it . Okay , Oscar ? " said Harry . " Naah , " said Oscar , answering his own question . " You ai n't in love with Angela . You just got a case of the hots , that 's all . So why pick Angela ? She 's nothin ' but trouble .

" I 'm only thinking of you . " " That 's a laugh , " said Angela bitterly . " When did you ever think about me ? " " When I had time , " answered Oscar . " Thanks a lot . " " Angela , listen , " said Oscar . " I do n't know from love . If I had to tell a dame I love you ' it would bust my jaw . But just the same I got a feeling for you , and a big one . Remember , kid , we had ten years together . " " I remember , " she said grimly . " I remember well . " " Okay , so they were ten lousy years . But I 'll tell you something : only a sonofabitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you want to get marriedagain , good luck . But find somebody like me . Do n't start up with guys like this .

You marry him , you 'll have him chewed to a pulp in six months . Then what ? Back to Reno again ? Then look for another Bannerman ? Chew him up ? Back to Reno ? Is that the routine ? " " Oscar , butt out ! " Her voice was a shriek and her eyes were swimming with tears . " Angela , do n't do it , " said Oscar quietly . " Not191RALLY ROUND Bannerman . I 'm telling you this because , believe it or not , I really feel for you . Lay off Bannerman . You 're a monster , Angela . Find another one . " Angela flew at Oscar , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was beyond words . Oscar grabbed her wrists and held her powerfully for a moment while he looked into her eyes . Then he re- leased her , turned , and walked out of the room . Harry stood in silence , pity and embarrassment keeping his gaze averted from Angela . " I 'm sorry about this , " he said . " About everything . . . Good- bye , Angela . " " No ! " cried Angela , bursting into tears . She rushed to Harry , threw her arms around him , pressed her heaving body against his . Clutching , trembling , weeping piteously , she begged , " Do n't leave me ! Please , Harry ! Not just yet . Please stay awhile . Just a little while . Please ! " Gently Harry pried himself loose . " I 'm going , Angela , " he said as kindly as he could . " Oh , God , I 'm so alone ! " she wailed , throwing her hands over her face . " I 've lost everything  --  everybody ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Harry fought to keep his arms at his sides , to keep from gathering Angela to him to kiss her tears and stroke her shoulders and salve his guilt . " Goodbye , " he said softly . " Believe me , it 's best . " She turned her face to his . Mascara streaked her cheeks . Her mouth trembled . Desperation darted from her eyes . " A little while , " she begged . " Please stay with me a little while . You owe me that much ! " Harry hung his head . " I 'm sorry , " he said , al-192 most inaudibly . He picked up his coat , opened the door , and left without looking back . He walked to the elevators and pressed the button . In a moment an elevator arrived . " Down , " said the boy . Harry stood rooted . " Going down , sir ? " said the boy . " No , " said Harry . The elevator descended without him . He turned and walked slowly back to Angela 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a gymnasium , but a very lopsided dumbbell . This , roughly , is the shape of a Nike base . One bell of the dumbbell contains about ten acres , the other contains about fifty acres , and connecting the two bells is a narrow bar approximately one mile long . The ten acre bell is called the IFC ( for IntegratedFire Control ) Area . This is the brains of the Nike system . There are three radars here : one scans the skies ; one tracks the target ; one tracks the missile . There are also two vans , the size of trailer trucks , both jammed with electronic equipment . The RC ( for Radar Control ) van operates the radarsand gathers their data ; the BC ( for Battery Control ) van computes the data and sends the Nike up after the target . The Nike takes off from the other bell  --  the fifty acre Launching Area . This bell includes a large shed where the Nikes are assembled and groundtested , a fueling area behind eight-foot mounds of194RALLY ROUND THE FLAG , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acids , an LC ( for Launching Control ) van which maintainscontact with the IFC Area , and three concrete launching pits thirty feet deep . In these pits , the combat-ready Nikes are stored . When an alert is sounded , some quick last-minute adjustments are made to the Nikes , the steel doors on top of the pits yawn open , and the Nikes are hydraulically lifted to the surface for launching . Joining the two bells is a mile-long strip , cleared of trees , hills , and buildings , so that the line of sight may be unbroken . In both the IFC and Launching Areas are various administrative buildings , supply rooms , mess halls , bachelor officers ' quarters , and barracks  --  all neat , low , cinder-block structures , painted to harmonize with the surrounding countryside . In one of the barracks at the Nike base in Putnam'sLanding on a Saturday morning in early spring , Corporal Opie Dalrymple , in his underwear , was handing down a pronouncement to several of his colleagues , also in their underwear . " Frinds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is Welcome Nike Day . In a little while we 're all goin ' down to the Town Hall and drank some temperance punch and look over the poon . Now , frinds , they 're gon na be lookin ' us over too . So hear me good : Put on yore cleanest , newest , spankin'est uniforms . Shine yore buttons and make a pretty little knot in yore necktie .

" " Yes , Opie , " they said . " All right , " he continued . " That 's half the secret : look shorp . Now Ah 'll give you the other half : ack mis'able . " " Look sharp and act miserable ?

" Jest kinda establish it , and then git frisky and sparklin ' . Tell her that heavy-laden though you be , you jest cai n't stay sad with her around . Tell her she melts yore troubles like a summer sun burns off a mornin ' mist . . . If that do n't get her , she ai n't worth havin ' . " " Ah ! " said the men-at-arms . " Any questions ?

" " Tell the new girl about the old girl ? " asked PrivateErnest J. Hoffman incredulously. 196THE FLAG , BOYS ! " Why , shore , " said Opie . " Then she knows she ai n't scratchin ' after a prize that nobody else wants . " " Ah ! " said the citizen-soldiers . " But what if you have n't got a girl back home ? " asked Private Gustave Morrissette . " Then lie , " said Opie . " But lie from the hurt ! " At this point someone at the end of the barracks hollered " Ten-hut ! " Everybody popped to attention in his underwear , and Lieutenant Guido di Maggio came walking into the barracks . " Oh , it 's you , Lieutenant , " said Opie , and every- body promptly stood at ease . The boys had been at Putnam 's Landing only three days , but already they knew that Guido was not a man to dwell on rank . In fact , it embarrassed the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I guess you 've all got some civilian clothes here , have n't you ? " " Yes , sir , " they said . " Good , " said Guido .

" " I am deeply moved , " said Guido . " But you 'll wear civvies to the party . This town has n't been oc- cupied since the Revolutionary War , and I 'd just as soon not make the burghers any shakier than I have to . " " But , sir , " Opie persisted , " we all shipped our good suits home . All we got is slacks and sport shirts . What Ah mean , sir , we 'd look a heap more staunch and manly in our uniforms .

" " I have that , " agreed Guido . " So I 'd appreciate all the help you can give me today . When you meet the citizens , would you kind of gawk and shamble and say Shucks ' whenever possible ? " " Ah can make my voice crack if you want , " said Opie . " We better not overdo it , " answered Guido . " But thanks anyhow ... All right , get into your slacks and sport shirts . There 'll be a truck in front of the orderly room at eleven-thirty . And please , when you get to Town Hall , try your very , very best not to goof .

And , believe me , gentlemen , no matter who they send in to replace me , you could n't possibly have it this good ! " " Sir , " said Opie , " we are fairly warned . " " See you , " said Guido and waved and left . Sadly the men gathered around Opie . " That sure takes care of our plans ! " complained Private Wil- Liam O. Wambess . " Man proposes , God disposes , " said Opie philo- sophically . " But stay loose , frinds . We 'll play it by ear . " 198THE Welcome Nike Party commenced promptly at noon in the meeting room of the Town Hall , and among those present were the following nervous persons : Guido di MaggioGrace BannermanHarry Bannerman Comfort Goodpasture Manning ThawGuido di Maggio was nervous because he knew that if he did not make good as public relations officer , he would soon be on a shipping list to the frozen North , and standing not two feet away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public relations : Captain Walker Hoxie . Walker , it must be said , had not wanted to come to the party . He had , in fact , informed Guido that he would sooner dive into a tank of barracuda , but Guido had felt **29;10798;TOOLONG the way up the river the two captains , with Gravelines , had now and then walked along the bank with the Arikara chief , who seemed to be a friendly decent sort , they now concluded , in spite of his hysterics over the punishment of John Newman . He delighted them with his knowledge of wild animal life . One afternoon they saw otter playing . The chief told them that when this beast was frightened , its scream was equaled in bloodcurdlingintensity only by the cry of two other things in nature , that of the loon and that of the eagle . He said the otter was all pure grit , that it had more grit than any other creature on earth . He told them that when a family was swimming in single file , the strange undulatingmovement just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the foolish was , for a huge serpent . The captains were more interested in the wild beasts ahead of them up the river . This chief told them what other men , both white and red , had told them , that up the river were bears so monstrous that they scared a man out of his wits just to look at them . His people , he said , would rather face the Sioux than these beasts . If , after long preparation , the boldest warriors decided to attack one of these giants , they went in groups of ten , twelve or even twenty , and then the outcome was likely to be in favor of the bear . This beast was so huge and powerful that with a full-grown deer in its jaws it would rush headlong to attack a hundred or a thousand men . Every other animal lived in terror of it . Wolves fled before it as before fire . Not even a whole gang of buffalo bulls dared to face it . The captains were incredulous . They had both hunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They supposed that this chief , more wily than he seemed , was trying to discourage them from going up the river ; for when they asked about the Blackfoot warriors this Arikara chief actually shuddered . He actually glanced round him like a man badly frightened . " These bears , " Lewis said to Gravelines , " ca n't be that big and terrible . " Had the captains seen their tracks ? Yes , they had seen them and admitted that they were huge . The chief did not exaggerate , Gravelines said : this grizzled monster could gut a buffalo bull from shoulder to tail with one sweep of his talons . It was almost impossible to kill it , even if you shot it right through the heart . He had known one that was shot clear through ten times , yet ran away and escaped . The captains glanced at one another . They did n't believe a word of it . Tabeau and Gravelines told them many things that were calculated , the captains decided , to scare them out of their wits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would all get sick and die living on nothing but meat . One night Clark wondered if Tabeau was right : he was seized by an attack of pain in his neck that left him paralyzed . He could move only his tongue . Lewis brought hot stones wrapped in flannels and banked them against Clark 's neck and upper spine . " Tabeau says if we eat only the muscle and not the viscera the way the Indians do we 'll all get sick and die . I can almost believe it . " Clark suffered dreadfully but two days later was well enough to smoke a pipe of peace with a Mandan chief . The next day a great number of Mandan Indians came to the bank to see the white men , among them a warrior whose small fingers had just been severed at the second joint . This , Gravelines said , was to show grief . If the grief were deep enough over the loss of a loved one , the brave might cut off three or four or even eight fingers , for he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the two blood-reddened stubs , Lewis said , " Cutting off eight I expect would be for a wife . " Gravelines glanced at him and saw the droll lights in the slate-gray eyes . A little later the captains met Rene Jessaume , about whom they had heard from Tabeau. jessaume was a squawman who had traded among the Indians a long time . He was an old sneaking cheat , oneP104white trapper had said ; and another had called him a worse thief than any red man on earth  --  a skunk and a scoundrel who to the white man 's vices had added those of the Indian . What the captains saw when Jessaume faced them was a dark , rather short and very filthy Frenchman , with dirt in his hair and beard and an offensive odor all over him . He did not meet a man 's eyes but seemed to stare at the point where his hair met his forehead . Because he spoke some Mandan the captains hired him as an interpreter . Their first task was to gather from him information about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , as nearly as they could spell it , the Rooptaree , and its principal chief was Poscopsahe , meaning Black Cat . This chief , they had heard , was a good Indian ; after only two meetings with him Clark decided that Black Cat had more integrity , firmness , intelligence and insight than any other Indian he had known . At Matootonha the principal chief was Shotaharrora , meaning Coal , who was really an adopted Arikara . Next to him in rank was Shahaka , meaning the Coyote , but known as Big White because , Jessaume said , he was more white than Indian . Big White , he said , was a loudmouth and a blowhard whom Le Borgne , the Evil Eye , detested . A mile on up the Missouri , at the mouth of Knife River , was a village of the Anahaways , whose chief was White Buffalo Robe ; and up Knife River a few hundred yards was Metehartan , the first of the Big Belly villages , whose chief was Black Moccasin . The overlordof the Big Belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some others Evil Eye . Jessaume said he was the meanest man and the most bloodthirsty monster between St. Louis and the headwaters of the Athabasca . His one woman was a Minnetaree but for the captains Jessaume recommended the Mandan squaws . He said they could really make medicine . Clark was out looking for timber for a fort when Jessaume trailed along , still jabbering in a jargon of French and English . If the captains shied away from copperskins there were the almost-whites , some with blue eyes , some with gray eyes , and now and then one who actually had yellow hair . Most squaws were pretty bowlegged and personally , Jessaume said , he liked them that way ; but if the captains did not , they would find that some of the almost-whites had legs as straight as any woman in St. Louis . And breasts , mon Dieu ! But was it true , as his father used to say , that on revient toujours a ses premieres amours ? He doubted that , he said . He had once lovedp105a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red children . .. . Clark paid little attention to the man 's chatter . He was feeling in his bones the coming of winter and he wanted to get warm lodges built , so that his men would be at top strength when spring came . No matter how much they discounted the stories of the hazards and perils before them it was no use pretending that the risks were not many and great . Strong men were braver men . The Mandan lodges had impressed both him and Captain Lewis . From the outside , a lodge , except the entrance , looked like an enormous mound of earth ; but on entering the captains saw that it was built of timber , in circular form , and covered over with earth and banked up with earth . Some of the lodges were ninety feet across but most of them were much smaller . In the center of each lodge was a square fireplace , about five feet on each side , set two feet belowthe surface of the floor . At the apex of the conical roof was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rained was covered over with a buffalo hide or a bullboat . This hole served not only as chimneybut also as window . The wide door was made of raw buffalo hides stretched on a frame , and hung in such a way that the door at night could be barricaded . The earth floors of the lodges were so hardened by use and heat , and kept swept so clean , that they looked polished , and in spots like marble or granite . The captains were surprised to learn that these Indians slept on bedsteads : these were made of round peeled poles bound together with leather thongs : a green buffalo hide was stretched tight across the poles and made secure at the sides , and when it dried and contractedit became as taut as a drum . Uppermost was the fur side , on which they lay , with buffalo robes over them , and a folded robe as a pillow . In the larger lodges as many as a hundred and fifty or even two hundred Indians lived , with their dogs and horses . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one side , nibblingat cottonwood boughs . Against the huge posts toward the middle , which supported the central part of the roof , leaned canoe paddles , bows and spears ; and from poles hung from post to post five or six feet above the floor were suspended green pelts , arrow quivers , moccasins , stomach-pouches , and various garments which the squaws were mending . Here , as with the Arikaras , the occupantssat around half-naked in a chamber warmed by fire and byP106the heat of the beasts , the bucks sitting against poles and smoking , the squaws busy , as squaws always were . The Mandans , unlike most Indian tribes , were not nomadic . They had settled down to a life of agriculture and hunting , and they fled their warm comfortable houses only when a stronger nation overpoweredthem . They lived , Tabeau said , in deadly fear of the Sioux , but seemed to like to wage war against the Arikaras . The captains had brought the Arikara chief upriver to plead for peace with the Mandans ; and when in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them said it was all right , they would live in peace with the Rees , for they were tired of killing them anyway . This reason was so quaintly childlike that Lewis snorted . He then gave to the principal chiefs a flag and a medal , and a special commissionfrom the White Father ; and to the two top chiefs a coat , and a hat with plumes . One Lewis speech was so long-winded , with so many interruptions for translation , that a Big Belly chief suddenlyleapt up and said he must go home , for he smelled deception and double-talk here , and suspected that his village was being attacked . A Mandan chief chided him , and he again sat . Le Borgne was there , with the eyes of both captains studying him ; he had come by special invitation , and his two eyes , one covered with a white film , the other fiercely black and glowing , kept moving in his skull as he sucked at his pipe and looked from captain to captain . One-Eye had been suspicious from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York and had stood for five minutes looking up and down the black giant . Gravelines said that old Evil Eye thought York was very bad medicine . He called for water , and when a pailful was brought to him he did his best to wash the black off one cheek . Failingthere , he scrubbed away at a hand . He looked at a palm and saw that it was whiter than the back of the hand , and for a few moments he washed the palm . He then stared at the fingernails . He told York to take a moccasin off , and then examined the foot , kneeling and grunting . York all the while rolled wild eyes at his master . Le Borgne gave up at last . He went away muttering to himself and turningnow and then to look back at York . He was very suspicious , Gravelines said . He knew that had medicine was being used against him and was beside himself with fury because he could n't figure out what it was . Evil Eye decided that the medals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would have none of them . Tabeaup107had told the captains what to expect when this chief came . He gave them the story of Kakawita , principal chief of the Arikaras , an arrogantferocious devil who had come into possession of magic . Like Blackbird , the Maha chief , when he foretold that a person would die the person died . There had never been an exception . He used some kind of poison , Tabeau supposed , but no white man had ever learned what it was . For the red people it was magic . Le Borgne , knowing that these palefaces had been with his enemies , the Arikaras , was doubly suspicious when he learned that an Arikara chief had come up the river with them . When a medal was given to him he hastily passed it on to a minor chief , and the bad medicine with it . A sharp observer of Evil Eye 's face could have read in it the contempt for all the big brag and boasting of Chief Lewis . By the Great Manitou and the Unseen Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own nation was the most powerful on earth , and could any day go down the Missouri and over to the village called Washington , and return with the scalp of the Great White Chief and all his preposterous braggarts . And so , smoking and glaring round him to keep the bad medicine away , he said nothing . Aware of his hostility , the captains were uneasy . They rushed the building of the fort . They wondered if next spring the old murderer might follow them up the river with two or three hundred picked warriors  --  for these bold people , the Minnetarees , had gone clear to the Rocky Mountains a number of times , and had even fought the Blackfeet . The captains decided to keep an eye on this red giant with his eagle-beak and heavy lips . If things rubbed him the wrong way he might decide to enter a league with the Sioux for the exterminationof the white party . The captains were still searching up and down the river for a site for their winter camp when by accident or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prairie . Swept by a strong wind into enormous leaping manes of orange-red and smoke-black , the blaze overtook a Mandan buck and his wife and burned them alive while they ran ; swept in mountainous red billowing over a man , woman and child and left them crawling away blackened and whimpering , all their hair and clothing burned off ; and sent another mother fleeing for her life , but not before she had thrown a green buffalo hide , flesh side up , over her son and told him to be quiet . The boy under the hide was saved , not by the green hide , the Mandans said , but by the Great Medicine Spirit , who had watched over him because hisp108father was white . Smiling a little , Clark entered it all in his journal , and then went over to Lewis to observe him as physician and surgeon . The three half-burned-to-death creatures seemed to be dying yet made no moan . Even their eyes and eyelids looked cooked . " I do n't know what we have for burns , " Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of medicines . " A poultice ? Have we anything for a poultice ? " " Maybe juice-urn knows of something . " Jessaume was lazy . He said he knew of nothing in the country roundabout that could be used as a poultice . He said the three Indianswould die anyway . But Lewis mixed a few things into a paste and gently covered the wounds . Not once did man , woman or child wince under his fingers . He wished his mother was here ; she would know what to do . He could amputate a frozen toe or finger , lance an abscess , give a purge or emetic and cut imbedded briars out of festeringsores ; but he had never seen such horrible burns and he did n't know what to do for them . When he turned away at last he felt half-sick with melancholy . Always he felt this way after ministering to Indians , for , like beasts , they were so mute and helpless . Like a dog 's , their eyes looked at you with hope and prayer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next day the father and mother seemed a little better , the child worse . Lewis searched in the woods but could find nothing for poultices . He wished he had enough soda to immerse all three in a big warm soda bath . Hearing of Lewis as a medicine man , a great many Indians came to the river to see the white men but forgot the white men the momenttheir gaze fell on York . Like those down the river , they were unable to control their itch to touch him . With York it was becoming a kind of ritual . He loved it . He would let them wash and pinch and rub , his rolling eyes proclaiming his raptures ; and at last he would astound them with feats of strength , or with his dancing . He was indeed , the captains decided , worth a bushel of blue beads . It was York 's dancing that held the Indians spellbound . Tuesday evening , October 3oth , the captains gave their men a dram of what they called ardent spirits , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They danced square dances , with John Potts calling the turns . Some of the men made their own music by singing and shouting . But not York . He danced alone in his own solitary splendor and the eyes of all the red people were fixed on him . He was so loose andp109limber in his legs and joints  --  even , the captains had observed , in his elbows and shoulders  --  that no other man in the Corps would have thought of competing with him . His feet in his jigging and clogging were faster than the human eye , and on his lower legs the fringes of the buckskin leggings made a fantastic dance rhythm . His eyes rolled as if the swift movements of his feet and legs fed ecstasies upward to his swooning passions , until his whole big frame was atremble and on the point of melting in one overwhelming orgasm of all his senses . And here , as in the Arikara villages , the young wives swarmed round him , eager and squealing ; and their husbands stood back , wondering how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most talked-about and sought-after person in the whole Mandan area . And how he loved it ! Though a slave on call to his master twenty-four hours a day he became more and more arrogant . He felt that if the women preferred him above all other men , red and white , there must be something special about him . He did n't know what it was but he knew that he had it and he was proud of it . The white men who danced and sang strove to fix on themselves the fascinated interest of the young women . Failing in this , some of them muttered threats against York , but Bob Frazier , the handsome fencing-master , composed rimes and sang to the girls . " 0 form devinewilt thou be mine ? " he would sing , and blow kisses . He drew a twitter once in a while but nothing more . " Just fill him full of bitter Alice ! " Joe Fields cried . But Bob Frazier sang , " Like whisky kegs those Mandan legs ! Like pimpernel that bosom 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud , it was hardly fair to charge these Mandan Indians with offensive odors , for they bathed two or three times a week , leaving their lodges early in the morning and going to the river . He and some of the other men spied on them . The women wore a leather skirt that reached a little below their knees . When a few yards from the water they unfastened the skirt and let it fall , and , running naked to the river , plunged in . They all seemed to be superb swimmers , young and old . Frazier thought the younger women almost beautiful when they unbraided their hair and let it fall in a wide mane down their backs . Some of the men had hair so long that the braids reached the earth , and it was not uncommon to see hair trailing on the ground . November had come with bitter winds and cold , and Clark still sought timber for a fort . One day he took Paddy Gass and three otherp110men and went back down the river . He felt miserable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and down his legs ; flashes of hot pain down his thighs ; a sensation of ache and strain in his eyeballs . He supposed he had been using his eyes too much while bent over his drawings and map-making . The Mandan women had been generous ; they had brought bushels of beans which , Juice-urn said , they stole from the prairie mice . It seemed that the mice gatheredthis wild bean by the ton and stored it for winter use . The women , probing with sharp sticks , found the underground hoards and took them away . Oh , not all of them , Juice-urn said : they left food for the mice , so that they could live and work again . The women had also brought a few bushels of corn and many squash . Clark hoped that eating this food and less meat would straighten him up . Paddy was limping . " My ole knee-jints is pure onaisiness itsilf , " he complained , limping along and grimacing . " Yisterdee I like to a-died . From me knees up to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We need a big dolt of something , " one of the men said . Clark while walking was looking for both timber and food . Juice-urn  --  the men spelled his name variously in their journals but they all called him Juice-urn  --  had said that besides meat the Indians of this area used black walnuts , hickory and hazel nuts , sweet acorns , prickly pear , as well as all wild fruits , including grapes , cherries , currants , plums , apples and pawpaws . Clark hungered for nuts and fruits . A part of his time he dwelt on the hazards that would face the Corps when , next spring , it entered the vast unknown , and among those hazards he now put a diet of nothing but musclemeat . All the way up the river it had been meat three times a day , cooked in three big kettles . The flesh was stripped off the bones , cut into large chunks and thrown into the kettles to boil ; and the men ate the chunks while clutching them with both hands , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such big hearty hungry men that they ate two or three elk , six or seven deer , or a big buffalo and a half every twenty-four hours . And most of them were complaining of rheumatism and tight bowels . What , Clark wondered , if across the unknown they were to find nothing to eat but flesh ? They might all be laid low with rheumatic paralysis . A mile downstream from the nearest Mandan village Clark and his group came to a flat bottom above the river , thick with cottonwoodtrees . The men went through the woods , straining their necks up . Cottonwood did not grow straight , save in the most favorablep111situations . Here the trees looked as though they had been whipped all their lives by winds . Clark asked Gass if he could build lodges and a stockade of this timber . Sergeant Gass , rolling his quid from cheek to cheek , looked up and squinted . The men all thought of him as an Irishman but his family had come from Scotland . He was part Irish . Now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because he was a canny man who had learned that most people liked the Irish more than the Scotch . He had gone to school only nineteen days in his life and that was after he was grown , but he had picked up knowledge of a lot of things . He was an expert with broadhorns , scows and squarebows . He was an expert with an ax . For two and a half years he had been a carpenter 's apprentice , and it was for this reason that Lewis and Clark had chosen him over a hundred other applicants . Paddy was their carpenter-in-chief . A shrewd fellow , Paddy knew that a man should take his time beforeanswering an important question . He had observed that the man who popped an answer right out was thought to be a fool . He tongued his quid and took his time , squinting this way and that . He walked deeper into the woods ; squirting from one corner of his mouth ; looking up and sighting and taking views in all directions . At last he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back unobserved by Paddy and watching him was George Shannon . George was amused , but was remembering that Paddy had not amused the Mandan Indians . They had a stuff that they used as tobacco and they were boastfully proud of it . Paddy was a chewing man , not a smoker , and when the bucks pressed some of their tobacco on him he had stuffed his mouth full of it and pushed it around with his tongue , his face looking more and more offended . Then with one terrific explosion he had ejected the whole lot of it , and followed it with such loud curses that the Indians were outraged . Lewis , watching , had said quickly , " Sergeant , wars have been started over insults smaller than that . " He told Juice-urn to explain that Paddy 's taste in tobacco was most peculiar , and then filled his pipe with the Indian weed and seemed to smoke with great enjoyment . The Indians felt better but not one of them had any more time for Paddy . Paddy had gone around for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was a man of strong prejudices . Hep112did n't like Negroes and he did n't like Indians . As for the Mandan weed , it was not tobacco at all but a prairie plant that they harvestedand smoked because they had nothing better . Paddy had learned with horror that if they had neither tobacco nor the prairie weed they then smoked buffalo dung , which they first scented with the sex glands of the heaver . It gagged him to think of the red man 's ways . " The pups ! " he said , muttering to himself while honing his ax . Pups was his word of utter contempt for all young men and for any older man who seemed full of ignorance and presumption . The next morning the Corps moved to the river bottom , and Paddy and his men set to work . Clark , who had watched the building of winter forts under General Wayne , supervised the plans , while Lewis day after day , sitting by a cottonwood campfire , worked on the reportswhich he hoped to send downriver to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stockade were built in the shape of a segment of pie , with the cabins opening inward . The stockade base was walled in with unusually large pickets . While the men labored under Gass , the greenhorns cutting themselves with their tools and raising blisters on their palms , there came down the river a FrenchCanadiantrapper , who the past five years had been living with the Big Bellies . He said his name was Toussaint Charbonneau . He offeredhimself for hire as an interpreter . Lewis did n't like the look of the man . He saw before him a Frenchmanof above-average height , with long black hair , a heavily bearded face , cunning evasive eyes , and a posture that seemed to have in it the stoop of age . This man , he thought , was about fifty years old . He spoke in English so strongly accented that Lewis could barely understand him , but did make out that Charbonneau knew a lot of Indian languages and knew them well . That was good . The man said all the nations trusted him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not a lie . The man said , " Ou allez-vous ? " and when Lewis said sharply , " What did you say ? " the Frenchman shrugged . Lewis called Labiche over . " Tell him I 'll discuss the matter with Captain Clark and let him know . " During the next few days Lewis learned as much as he could about this man . All the red chiefs seemed to hold him in contempt : they had given him a half-dozen names , all derisive : he was the Great Horse from Abroad , the Forest Bear , the Man with Many Gourds , the Chief of Tiny Village , and Old Bean Poop . Juice-urn , plainly not a disinterested informant , said that Old Bean Poop was the name Lep113Borgne had given him . Old Bean Poop was a coward , Juice-um said ; he could n't swim a stroke , even though he had been on rivers all his life . He was a wife-beater and a raper of young girls  --  Juice-urn said that when a squaw caught him red-handed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; and another had chased him with a flaming fagot right into the river , where the fool would have drowned if he had n't hooked his chin over a piece of driftwood . The thing most characteristic of him , Juice-urn said , was his uncontrollablepassion for immature girls . Old Bean Poop did n't like adult squaws . He wanted the young things , and the young things had been his to use and flog during all his years in Indian land . Had Captain Lewis heard of the Snake Indian girls ? When only small children they had been captured by a marauding party of Big Bellies and brought all the way down the long rivers . Since that time the two girls had been any man 's women , until they came into possession of Old Bean Poop , who had won them in a gambling game . Did the captains intend to visit the Snake Indians ? Knowing that the question was loaded , Lewis ignored it . He asked how old the girls were . Juice-urn did n't know . They were Shoshone Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Lewis mind was racing westward . " Where do the Shoshones live ? " Juice-urn pointed into the west . They were yonder , he said , a longfar-distance . They were a thousand miles farther than any white man had ever gone . They were even beyond La Roche Jaune . " Farther than the Blackfeet ? " " Ho-ho-hol " Juice-urn had to chuckle at that . Did these Snake girls want to return to their people ? Mon Dieu , monsieur ! Had there ever been a captive Indian who did not want to go home ? What were they now but slaves ?  --  one man 's today , another'stomorrow , depending on a game of chance  --  to be tomahawkedat last or kicked out to the wolves . Did they have children ? Mon Dieu ! They were nothing but children themselves . Lewis took the matter to Clark . It would be wonderful , he said , to have with them a Shoshone Indian , for undoubtedly they would meet the Shoshone nation ; but on the other hand , it would be ab/solute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squawman , what did Clark think of him ? " I do n't like his looks . " " Juice-urn says he beats small girls and rapes them . " " He looks about like it . " The first thing Clark saw in the girl when one morning she came to the white man 's camp was her pregnancy . She looked grotesque because she was so small and her belly was so large . She had heard that the white men were going up the river next spring , and in her timid birdlike way she approached Clark , her black eyes on his face . She knew only a few English words and at first spoke in a French jargon . " La-haute " she said , pointing at the west . Looking beyond her , Clark saw another woman , or child , and supposedthat she was the other Snake girl . She was hanging back , watching and waiting . The girl before him  --  or child , for he could see that she was only a child  --  seemed intelligent . She had a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he found her appealing . He had a great love of children but he was not stupid enough to considertaking along a child who was pregnant . He waved her away and returned to his work but she came again , this time in buckskin . He could now see that though pregnant she did not yet have a womanly form but looked almost pathetically small . Her braid of hair hung to her knees . She had a way of turning her head from side to side when looking at him ; of cocking it a little , as though listening with the ear toward him ; and then of cockingit the other way , as though to listen with the other ear . It was this in her that reminded him of birds  --  this and the intentness of her eyes . The Mandans were calling Lewis Chief Long Knife because of the long sword he wore , and Clark they called Chief Red Hair . Clark was writing when she came up . She stood back and looked at his hair and for a little while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labiche and with Labiche came Charbonneau . Clark said to Labiche , " What does she want ? " Labiche took the girl aside and talked to her and Charbonneau . Then the three of them came over to Clark and Labiche said she wanted to go with the party next spring . " She thinks we 'd take a woman and baby ? She must be insane . " Charbonneau said Indian women were not like white women . Ifp115a nation was on the march an Indian woman could go to the bushes and have her child and rejoin her people within an hour . A squaw was used to hard work and hardship , and the baby would make no difference at all . " Ask her how far it is to her people . " " C'est loin d'ici . " " I said how far ? " It was many sleeps . " Tell her we ca n't bother with women and children . " But Clark again spoke of the matter to Lewis . He said that Indians never looked on a party as warlike if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a tremendous advantage to have the squaw along . " But what about the baby ? " " I thought possibly she could leave it here . " " But she might have another baby before we got back . " " I expect she 'd want to stay with her people , " Clark said . " Is her man willing ? " " He seems to be . " Clark said he had heard that both girls were weeping most of the time . " Maybe their man is putting them up to it . " " That might be . " " I do n't think we should bother with a woman , " Lewis said . Lewis had been looking curiously at his friend . Was there in Clark a deep weakness for women ? Or what was it ? Again the girl came to Clark and again Clark laid the matter beforeLewis . Looking at him with mingled astonishment and wonder , Lewis said , " If you want to take her along it 's all right with me but I would n't think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When Clark told the slave-girl they would take her she seemed to take leave of her senses . She ran away shrieking and was so blind to what she was doing that she bashed her face against a tree and knocked blood from her nose . Then she was shrieking again , and when she joined the other girl they both went running and crying like two demented things . With the help of George Shannon , who had the best ear in the Corps , the captains tried to make out her name . Charhonneau made gestures and they thought he was imitating the flight of birds . He uttered two or three words over and over , and at last George said , " Sack . Sack something . " He wrote it down . After a while he had sackp116a yar wee a and sack a jaw wee a . He wrote the name in still other ways and said he guessed her name was Sacagawea or Sacajawea . He asked Charbonneau to pronounce it again . Old Bean Poop had a thick tongue and spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird-woman ? " Lewis asked . When Shannon made flight movements with his arms the squawmanshook his head no and went through his act again . Sockakawea , Lewis thought it was . That , he said , was her Minnetaree name . Sacajawea , George said . Clark said he would call her Jawey . That was good enough . And so she was Jawey , the Snake slave-girl ; and for her , Lewis was Chief Long Knife , because of the long sword he carried , and Clark was Chief Red Hair . She soon became devoted to Clark . He said one day , " I expect we ought to make Shobono marry her . " Again Lewis looked curiously at his friend . He thought Clark must be woman-lonely . He was convinced of it when Clark moved the squawman and his two slave-girls into the white man 's fort.  |p117November  loth the winter quarters were completed and named Fort Mandan , and the men moved in . They were now safe from Sioux attackbut the captains never for a moment relaxed their vigilance . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a fireplace . For weeks now they had been looking forward to a quiet winter , during which they would prepare for their President various maps and data on the country they had traversed . They had looked forward to a time when their men could get a lot of sleep and build themselves up for the long dangerous trek that lay ahead of them . The captains realized little by little that it would be more perilous than they had thought . When , for instance , Clark called his interpreters to the slave-girl and had them ask her about the Blackfootnation she burst into tears and was so shaken by what Clark took to be terror that she was unable to speak . An hour later Clark was standing on an eminence and looking into the northwest , where the Blackfeet lived . Were they , as all the trappers and traders seemed to believe , the most savage and formidable Indians on the continent ? Quiet the captains had hoped for but there was to be little of it . Every day Indians came to pilfer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got himself into some sort of trouble . There was SergeantJohn Ordway , who had sense enough to know better but who was an utter fool over women . A week before the fort was completed a squaw had come screaming to Clark and had begged him to protecther . She had been stabbed three times and brutally beaten over her face and throat . She was covered with blood . Because she wasP118wounded and in deadly fear of her mate Clark allowed her to remain with the two girls . In a few days she returned to her village . Late one evening the man standing watch called to Clark . He said an Indian brave was ready to murder his wife . He was going to burn her alive . Clark summoned Charbonneau and hastened over . The Indian had his wife by the throat and while choking her until her eyes almost popped out of her skull he was dragging her toward a fire . Clark was surprised to perceive that this was the woman who had fled to him for protection . Seizing the Indian , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You damned fool , stand back ! " To Charbonneau he said , " Make him understand that we wo n't have any wife-beating around this fort . " The woman had fallen to the earth and was trembling and moaning . Charbonneau talked to the Indian . The red man , it seemed to Clark , was terribly angry ; never had he heard words spill with such fury and violence from a human mouth . The outraged husband was telling his story , not only with words but with wild gestures , now flinging an arm downward toward his woman , now toward the village . This is the story Clark heard from Charbonneau . Sergeant Ordway had enjoyed the woman 's good offices , with the approval of her husband , who had not minded at all until she ran away from him . Running away from her man was an offense punishableby death . But this husband was indulgent and loving and kind : he had not killed her , he had only stabbed her three times and tried to knock some sense into her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only one thing that her proud and insulted husband could do  --  he would have to kill her , and he had thought fire as good a way as any . The brave said that if the white man wanted her he could have her , but he would not put up with a wife who kept running away from him . Clark sent a guard to fetch Ordway and meanwhile tried his hand at giving the red man a lecture . Through Charbonneau he told him that marriage was a sacred bond between man and woman , to be respected and cherished ; that he should take his wife back to his lodge and be kind and gentle to her . Clark spoke further in the same moralizing vein , while Old Bean Poop translated , his astonishmentgrowing . " He haz zee right  --  zee right to keel her . " " Rights be damned , we wo n't have this sort of thing around here . "  | " He take her zair to keel her . " Charbonneau meant to the Mandan village . At this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sergeant , were you with this man 's wife ? " " Yes , Captain . " " Did he give you permission ? " " Yes , sir . " " Did you pay him for it ? " " No , sir . " " Then do so , make him feel all right about it . " " Yes , sir . " " And understand this , Sergeant , you 're not to molest this woman again , or any of the men . Tell them that . I think it would be well if all of you left the Mandan women alone . " " Yes , sir . You know , sir , they keep after us . " " Oh , I know it but I have n't seen any of you running from them . " At this moment a big chief of the Mandan nation came up . Charbonneau told him what had happened , and at once the chief stepped over and slapped the outraged husband on his red cheek . The crestfallen man slunk away , his wife with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry voice shouting . He was telling them , Charbonneau said , to get to their lodge and be a good husband and wife and not bother the white men any more . Clark returned to his cabin . A big fire was roaring in the fireplace and Lewis was sitting before it , smoking his pipe . Clark sat on a piece of tree stump by the fire . He ran a calloused hand through his golden-red hair and looked over at his friend . He told Lewis about Ordway and the squaw . " I ordered him not to touch them any more or any of the men . Did you know we have some bad cases of Louis Veneri ? " Lewis removed his pipe and looked at Clark . Clark went on : " The French and Canadian trappers say that with these Missouri Indians it 's never very serious but it 's bad enough to lay a man up . It 'll be a fine note if we have to set out with weak men . " " I 've been thinking about it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to the ocean ? " For a little while they were silent . Then Clark said , " Men will be men , we both know that . We 've seen them in one campaign afterP120another . If we put the squaws out of bounds would the morale of our men collapse ? " " I expect it would . Bean Poop has three women . Are they healthy ? " " Two of them are pregnant . " Lewis 's brows shot up . " The otter-girl too ? " " Besides , they 're only children . " Lewis smoked again and looked at the fire . " How old you think Jawey is ? " " Well , from the time she came here she was any man 's woman . Shobono says this is her first pregnancy , so she ca n't he much over thirteen or fourteen . " Clark looked behind him at his bed . He was weary . Some of his men had gathered dry moss , buffalo grass and small green twigs to make mattresses for the captains but their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Clark said , before he got rheumatism . Clark said , " Did you know the girl who 's going with us is a princess ? " Again Lewis 's brows shot up . " A princess ? " " Her brother is the big chief of the Shoshones . " " I 'll be damned , " Lewis said . " That 's better than blue beads . We should n't have any trouble with those Indians . Will she go all the way to the ocean with us ? " " She has promised to " " Well , " said Lewis , knocking his pipe out , " I did n't think we should bother with a woman and a baby but if she 's really the chief 's sister , and we have to have horses to cross the mountains --  Do her people have horses ? " " Many horses , she says . " " But if she dies what 'll we feed the baby ? Buffalo milk ? " " She says we 'll all die . Says the Blackfeet will kill us all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In their separate beds the captains lay cozily under their robes , thinking of their problems . They had a lot to worry about besides what they called Louis Veneri . Right now , at the end of November , traders were coming down from Canada to poison the minds of the red people . The chief liar and British agent of the whole lot was a man named Larocque , whose name Clark wrote in his Journal as Le rock . Le rock had been busy giving British medals and flags to the Minnetaree and Mandan chiefs . When the captains learned of this they withdrew to their cabin to talk it over . P121They simply had to stop him , Lewis said . Jefferson expected them to claim this entire country for the United States , and here were the damned British right under their noses , lying a blue streak . " Yes , " Clark said , " we must stop him but unless we 're careful we 'll have the whole Hudson Bay and North West companies down here . " " This Le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't pretend to him we 're just studying minerals and reading the stars . Lord , did you see how he looked at us ? Like he figures we 're bigger liars than he is . What I wonder is if a British party is already up the river ahead of us , or intend to be next spring . If they reach the ocean first this whole vast land will be part of His Majesty 's dominions . " " We 'd have to fight them in that case , " Clark said . " The President thinks we 'll have to someday anyhow . " The captains decided to invite some of the chiefs over . The wide river was full of floating ice and the sky of snow when Black Cat and some other important chiefs came to the fort . The captains showed them all the big medicine , including the swivel guns , the airgun , compasses , watches , thermometers , field glasses ; and gave them generously of tobacco , beads , awls , knives and pork ; and gently lectured them , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right at all to give them medals and flags , that only their American Father had this right . He would be offended if they accepted such symbols from the British and French . The chiefs , payingno attention , hugged their gifts to them and set off under the gray loveliness of winter storm . The next day , traipsing through snow more than a foot deep , Le rock came to call on the captains . Lewis thought it the right time to give him a piece of his mind . " By the way , " he said , after the formalities were over with , " we'veheard you 're making British chiefs with medals and flags . Is it true ? " took his time and coolly studied his man before replying . " I 've given them a few things , " he said . " It'sLarocque customary . " " You 're making them British chiefs ? " " Oh no , my dear Captain . I 've no such thought . " Studying the man with eyes as cool and steady as Larocque 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said , " We 're willing to share Shobono with you as translator , on condition he wo n't translate anything except what concerns the business of trading . " The more diplomatic Clark spoke up , saying , " Of course we 're far from thinking you 'd ask him to . " P123But the damage was done . The blunt Lewis had angered Larocque and he made no effort to conceal his anger . " I deny everything you seem to be charging me with , " he said coldly . " I can hardly give flags and medals , since I brought none with me . Good day , Captains . " The captains watched him stride away . Lewis said , " I raised hell that time . Where the British are concerned I do n't seem able to keep my mouth shut . " He thought a few moments and added , " Well , if they did n't intend to beat us up the river they 'll surely try to now . All because Meriwether Lewis has no gumption . " " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " but I can think of no way to do it . " A way to do it came , as if from heaven . The captains knew that in some of the Indian chiefs resentment toward them had been growing . Lewis one day called on a Big Belly chief and knew he was snubbed when a brave waved him away and said in signs that the chief was not home . Another chief had told Charbonneau that the white men had so much ammunition that they wasted it shooting at targets , yet gave them none . Black Moccasin had never once come to the councils , having arrogantly sent in his place a minor official named Cherry-on-a-Bush . Lewis was convinced that White Buffalo Robe Unfolded , of the Anahaways , had openly sneered at him . So matters stood for three days after Larocque 's call . Then early one morning Clark heard an Indian yelling across the river and sent a boat to fetch him . Through Charbonneau the red man had this story to tell . Five Mandan braves had gone hunting into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war-party of Sioux and Pawnees . One brave was slain , two wounded , and nine of their horses were stolen . The Anahaways had reported four of their men missing , and said they expected to be attacked by the Sioux any day . Seeing the golden opportunity , Clark laid the matter before Lewis and he agreed that now was the time to make a stand . If the Sioux were on the warpath and were coming north , all their ancient enemies should march south to meet them . Clark sent word to them that he would march at their head . At once he organized a war-party of twenty-three men , chosen for their courage and their skill with rifles , and within an hour after the red man told his story , Clark was crossing the river with his party and a few minutes later marched into the first of the Mandan villages . He had not foreseen the result . His men , armed to the teeth , presented such a formidable andp123terrifying appearance that nearly all the Indians ran away , shrieking with fright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He now ordered him to tell two Mandan chiefs , standing off at a distance and shivering , that the white brothers had come to the aid of the red , as the Great Father in Washington had said they would . Now was the time to wipe the Sioux off the earth . So let them come , all the brave Mandan warriors , and with their white brothers in the lead they would all march away . Charbonneau had barely ceased speaking when there was consternationthroughout the village . While most of the warriors were running away to hide , the chiefs went into a conference , their voices becoming loud and hysterical , their gestures frantic . Clark pulled his coat collar up around his face to hide his amusement . He had never had a high opinion of the red man as a fighter or of the red man 's courage . Pretending to be inspecting his weapons , he waited , and presently the talkative and flabby Big White stood before him , shivering and gesturing . His people , he said , were pleased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forked tongue when they offered friendship ; he said the Pawnees and Sioux were all liars and cheats and bad men ; he said his people had made peace with them again and again , only to fall under treacherous attack ; and at last , his full round womanly face twitching with emotion , he said that the snow was too deep now , the cold too dreadful , for his men to go to war . It would be better to wait till spring . Affecting anger and contempt , Clark cried , " Until spring , does this man say ? Tell him we go now , right this moment , to shoot his enemies ! Tell him to bring all his warriors and march with us ! " But Big White shivered and said again that it was much too cold . He would never take his horses out in such weather as this . " Horses , does he say ? Does he see us on horses ? Tell him he and his warriors will walk with us and destroy the Sioux ! " Big White'was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ride . It was a long way and it would tire them out to wade in the deep snow . " Tell him to be done with these evasions ! Tell him we are here to fight and will he go fight with us , or will he and his warriors go back to the squaws ? " Seeing Big White wince , Clark knew that he had understood . But lie would n't budge . Again in a loud voice Clark called on him andp124all his warriors to come at once and march away to fight , but the flabby chief shivered and looked over at the warm lodges . He said they would have to wait till spring . " Then why , " Clark demanded , his voice seeming to ring with anger , " why did he send the messenger to us ? " The women , Big White said , had been wailing and the children crying because their brave men had fallen ; but now they would scattertheir tears and weep no more . Now they would rejoice in the friendship of their white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt that he hoped would wither him . Then he gave a loud command and in military formation his men marched away , with every Indian in the village gawping after them . This dramatic display of friendship and power would , Clark hoped , give the Mandans and Minnetarees a change of mind  --  for he had no doubt that the Indians for miles around , perhaps clear to the Sioux , would know all about it before sunset . Returning to the cabin , he said to the amused Lewis , " Not a single damn one of them would go . " " You did n't expect they would , did you ? What did Big White say ? " " Shivered and whined . " Two days later Clark was working on a map when the heavy door of his cabin opened a little and two black eyes looked in . It was the Shoshone princess . Sharply he said , " What do you want ? " The face vanished , the door was closed . He sat in thought . Since he moved her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluttered round him like a bird ; smiling if he looked at her ; just softly disappearing if he did not . He realized that she was trying to express her gratitude . He was again bent over the map when a sergeant came to say that the Indian girl wished to see him . He did not know what for . She had been slipping around in the villages , looking and listening . He thought she had heard that the British intended to stop the Corps . " How ? " " By arming the Sioux . " " I do n't doubt that , " Clark said . Traders coming down from the north , Sergeant Pryor said , were telling the Indians that these white long knives were liars and cheats ; that the United States Army itself was puny and cowardly --  " What is that ? " Clark roared .   " Captain , I 'm just telling you what she tells her man and he tells us . " " Of course . Go on . " " The traders tell them we talk big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes . " " Better send her and her man in . " When the squawman and his slave came to the door Clark ushered them in and told them to sit on a pile of wood . He then studied them a few moments . When he looked at the girl she gave him a quick little childlike smile but the smile vanished when he looked at her man . Her man was not looking at Clark . He never did . " Has your squaw learned something from British traders ? " In a halting jargon of English , French and Indian , Old Bean Poop said what Pryor had said . Was he telling the truth , or hoping to win a whisky ration ? Clark at first had thought that this man was all French but had heard that a part of him was Indian . " Have your women go to the villages and learn all they can . " " Oui . Zee femme weesh make un bawx . " " A box ? For me ? " " Oui . " " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The slave-girl passed through the door behind her man and before closing it looked back a moment and smiled . Clark hardly knew what to make of her . She had made for Sergeant Gass a handsome razor box of carved wood , with an adjustable cover . Clark supposed that Gass had shown her some kindness . The red people had said it would be a cold hard winter and they were right . The night of December 13th the thermometer stood at twenty below zero , and the captains shivered in their beds all night , even though they had a blazing fire . The next morning when Clark opened the door he felt the cold enter and fill him with paralyzing swiftness , and with a grunt of astonishment he slammed it shut . He walked over to the fire , rubbing his hands . Three days later , with the cold abating only a little , a man named ! high Heney , together with Larocque and one named George Bunch , came to see the captains , looking frozen and walking so stiffly that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cabin Heney proffered a letter from Charles Chaboillez , boss of the North West Company on the Assiniboine . By firelight Lewis and Clark read it . Chaboillez expressed an eagerness to be of any service to themP127within his power . With neither captain 's face revealing a thing , Lewis returned the letter and with it his thanks . He then had a big kettle of hot boiled elk brought in , deep in its rich broth , and with tin cups as tools the five men sat before a roaring cottonwood-log fire and ate . They 'll come to it in time , Lewis was thinking  --  and a vision of the future United States stood in his mind as big as a continent . This was what the slave-girl had been trying to tell them , Clark was thinking , and fed tender dripping elk flesh into his bearded mouth , washing it down with hot broth . The captains had sensed that Heney was an intelligent man , with more formal education than they had had . They glanced at him now and then , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , with the most extreme politeness , Heney asked why they had come to this country and what their goal was . In the mischievous mind of Lewis the vision enlarged to embrace Canada , and the unknown land called California , and all the land south of the Big River . He said , " We like this kind of life . We 've some knowledge of plants and minerals , and so thought we 'd take a little journey in the interest of science . " Clark said , " Captain Lewis is collecting seeds . I expect he has more than a hundred kinds already , and some of them might do for beauty or profit in the United States . " " President Jefferson is interested in plants of all kinds , " Lewis said . Heney nodded , his face revealing nothing . He said he had heard that there had been a change in government . Just what was that ? Lewis said , " The United States bought Louisiana from the French . " He stopped there . He wanted to force Heney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Does your President feel that you 're in Louisiana now ? Is all this a part of what you bought ? " Lewis was trying to formulate a prudent reply when the more tactful Clark said , " As scientists we have n't been thinking about where Louisiana is or is n't . We 're here to get specimens of seeds , animals and minerals . We even hope to take a wild goat back . " Heney was nodding and eating . Larocque was just eating and looking from face to face . Heney said he could give them sketches of the country between the Mississippi and the Missouri , if they had use for them , as well as information about Indian tribes farther west , if they were going farther west . If they were going farther : how softly he had spoken the word ! Lewis said they would like to see the sketches . As for Indians , was not the whole western part of thep127continent peopled with them ? And were not the Blackfeet always on the warpath ? Heney gave no reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he . Because it was such bitter cold outside Lewis invited the three men to spend the night in the fort . They accepted , and were assigned to one of the sergeants . With the utmost politeness the five men bade one another goodnight , and the captains were alone . " I hope the good Lord knows what he 's doing , " Clark said , opening the door a half-inch to sense the cold 's intensity . Gass , who had been out for wood , said trees were splitting open , and wolves were moving like things poured full of ice . The river here at the fort was now frozen clear across its fifteen hundred feet , and the three boats were stuck fast in the ice . The next night the mercury dropped to forty-two below zero , and just keeping alive became the primary task of every man in the fort . Charbonneau 's slaves heated stones for him and gave him part of their bedding . If the cold did not abate soon the fort would run short of wood , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been only ten below zero a group of hunters had gone to the prairie and returned badly frostbitten ; and since then it had become commonplaceto see men sitting dolefully with their naked feet thrust into a pail of water and floating ice . York had crossed the river and wandered toward the Mandan villages , to learn if any young squaws were pining for him . He had come limping back with his feet so badly frozen that he had had to cut his moccasins off . He said it felt as if he had ice instead of marrow in his leg hones . This night the captains did not go to bed . They sat huddled by the fire , one of them rising now and then to throw wood on . There was n't much heat in cottonwood , Clark said ; it was pulpy and porous and not much good for anything . But it had a wonderful scent when burning , Lewis said . How were the squirrel and the hen doing ? He looked over at his dog , sitting on his haunches , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's surface that hurt , Clark had said , but the shivering deep inside him  --  the cold in his organs and along his veins . The hen and the squirrel ? He supposed they were all right . If a hen could n't stand it in a cabin what would all the hens outside do ? The captains were determined to send a few live things to their President and had captured a squirrel and a hen . The squirrel they had brought to the surface by pouring water down its hole . It had come upP128drenched and gasping and feeble but not too feeble to sink its long sharp chisel-teeth into a Lewis finger when he picked it up . Clark said he wondered how cold it was on the Assiniboine , and Lewis said he hoped it was cold enough to send the damned British back home . Clark stood up and walked along the cabin walls , looking at them . The entire wall opposite the fire was gray with hoarfrost . Between the logs the builders had chinked with split pieces and then daubed over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay had cracked and in many places shrunk from the upper log or the chinking , and when Clark put a cheek close to the wall he could feel the cold air coming in from outside . Except that it was not like cold air ; it was coldness itself , so pure and intense that it stung like flame . He held a hand up against the roof timbers to see if it was warmer up there . In places the hoarfrost was a lovely filigree of tiny spires that looked like the whiskers of some little ancient man out of the far north . Lewis came over to the opposite wall for a drink of water . When he saw that the water in the pail was frozen over he stood and looked down at it , as any man might who doubted his senses . " I wonder if it gets this cold all the way up the Missouri . " He turned to look at the fire : it was blazing brightly in pale yellow , orange and charcoal dusk . Stooping , he put a finger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hoarfrost , and looking up at the roof timbers , saw that they were frosted over too . He went over and looked at the logs above the fire and would not have been surprised to have seen frost there . Throwing on more wood , he again sat , hands outstretched , a heavy buffalo robe down over his shoulders and back . " Why is it women stand cold better than men ? " Clark said he had no idea . He did n't pretend to know much about women . It occurred to Lewis after a while that he ought to look in on the men to see how they were doing but he shuddered right down the marrow of his bones when he saw himself opening the door and stepping outside . He could feel it now , could feel the cold come in and fill him so swiftly that he just stood there , unable to move . He could feel it over his face like an intense heat ; in his mouth like the heavy fumes of some deadly acid ; and like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the end of his nose felt as if it had dropped off . He could feel the cold isolate every tooth as it entered him , and numb his gums . Almighty Lord , he had never known suchp129cold as this , nor had Clark or any of the men . The red men had their horses in their big lodges tonight , where the scrawny beasts with raw sores on their backs were chewing cottonwood twigs in a slow weary cynical way , pausing now and then to heave their lean sides up with a long-drawn breath . He wondered why Indians were so brutal with their beasts . It did n't make sense . A horse with a back raw and festering was not a good mount . Recalling Clark 's words of a few moments ago , he fell to thinking about Indian women . They stood the cold better than their men . In recent days both men and boys had been to the fort with frozen hands and feet , and already he had amputated about a dozen black toes . But no females had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day gathering wood . It had been a cold day when one of the chiefs came , his squaw trudging behind him with a hundred pounds of corn on her back . The chief 's feet had been half-frozen in his moccasins , but her feet , in moccasins older and thinner , had seemed to be all right . Of course the labor ofcarrying such a burden had warmed her through . ... Ij " I expect I 'll be cutting off a lot of toes tomorrow , " Lewis said . " Maybe even some feet . " Lewis got up and stood by the fire , with two of his heaviest robes around him . He said he expected he ought to see how the men were doing . At the heavy plank door he stood a few moments before he could believe what he saw : it was entirely covered with frost . He touched the head of an iron spike and found the flesh of his finger stuck to it . " My God ! " he said . " What a night ! " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside and hanged it behind him . He was holding his breath but he then made the mistake of sucking in a huge gasping gulp of air , and it was so deadly in its cold that it choked him . For a few moments he seemed unable to move . Then , again holding his breath , he ran to the nearest cabin , a leanto that had been built of leftovers for the squawman and his girls . He rapped only once on the ill-fitting door before plunging inside . Taking a breath , he went over to the fire where the three of them sat huddled , with the man in the warmer and the women in the colder positions . Lewis stood above them , looking down , and the two girls looked up . " How are you ? " he asked , looking into the eyes of Sacajawea . She was smiling up at him . He wondered what a slave-child owned by a brute could find to smile at . Old Bean Poop , bowed under heavy robes , seemed to be talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying that he had a terrible pain in one side , deep in him , as though a knife had been left there . He needed a drink of wheeskee . " Are you warm ? " Lewis asked , looking at the pregnant girls . Jawey nodded her head yes . She was , he thought , the most cheerful human being he had ever known . Never had he seen her downcast , save for a few moments after her man had slugged her ; never touched by that melancholy that lay so heavy upon him . He looked round to see how much wood they had . Then , taking a deep breath and holding it , he bolted outside and for the cabin occupied by the sergeants . He found them sitting by a fire with robes over them . " Do n't get up , " he said when they moved . He went over and looked at their upturned faces . " How 's everyone ? " " All right , Captain , " Pryor said . " Plenty of wood ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a lot of wood , " Paddy Gass said . " Are n't you going to bed tonight ? " " The trouble is , " said Ordway , " if we make one bed who gets to sleep in the middle ? " " How are Newman 's feet ? " " Frozed bad , " Gass said , " but he walks . " Ordway said , " He worries because he ca n't go next spring . " Lewis looked in turn at the sergeants . " If we let the bars downfor one , soon the corral 's empty . None of us would come back alive . " " We understand that , Captain , " Pryor said . Ordway said , " That otter-girl , she bawls half the time . " Lewis thought about otter-girl after he returned to his fire . He had seen the poor thing hiding in a thicket and weeping . He had felt deep pity for her . Here she was , a child , a slave-child , a thousand miles or more from her own people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to tomahawk , to shove into a fire . She wanted her own kinsfolk , land , customs , language , but he and Clark had their stern and inexorable duty . They had in their care and would have clear to the ocean and back the lives of twenty or thirty men and it would be cowardly to risk those lives for an Indian girl . Yes , he had seen her weeping . She had asked Old Bean Poop to tell him that she would be no bother . She would find her own food . She would help row or tow the boats or she would walk . She could carry burdens . Oh , she would be no bother at all ! But Lewis knew thep131gallantry of men  --  knew that they would risk their lives , might indeed risk the life of the whole party , if the girl needed them . It simply could n't be . He told Clark what Ordway had said and Clark said he had seen her weeping . Lewis said , " I ca n't convince myself we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then : " We both know that no commander has a right to endanger his men by doing what is n't necessary . It may not be at all necessary to take the other girl . " The princess , Lewis said , might be of great help to them . " But I ca n't see that otter-girl could help us at all . " " I ca n't either , " Clark said . The captains did not speak of the matteragain . Midnight found them still by the fire , all their robes over them . Lewis thought it might fall to fifty below tonight . The poorer wolves would all freeze to death , and only God knew how many buffalo , elk and deer . Wild chickens would freeze hard sitting on their roosts ... . Clark was thinking of their men . On leaving St. Louis they had intended to take only ten or twelve with them beyond the Mandan villages , but if their journey proved half as dangerous as the traders said it would be they 'd need more men than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small a force . Which men they were to take was the problem now . They had n't seen them under fire . Four of them  --  Hugh Hall , Silas Goodrich , Richard Windsor and William Werner  --  were from the First U. S. Infantry and had seemed to be good men . Some of the others seemed to be good men . One trouble was that they had to take some who were skilled men rather than fighting men  --  like John Shields , the gunsmith ; half-blind Cruzatte , the boatman ; Paddy Gass , the carpenter . Some unsuspected virtues had been showing up this winter  --  such as the phenomenal marksmanship of Drewyer , the sensitive ear of George Shannon , the fiddle playing of Cruzatte and Gibson , the unfailinggood humor of John Potts , a fat Dutchman who stuttered to heat the band but could jig almost as well as York . . . . A wind had risen and was howling in winter madness around the stockade and cabins . It turned Clark 's thoughts to the world outside  --  to the broad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herds of buffalo huddled together out on the prairie , their rumps to the wind . How many of them were there ? In October he and Lewis had stood on a hill and counted fifty-two separate herds . Indians saidp132that far up the river  --  around the Great Falls  --  they were thicker than stars on a clear night . And the wolves were even thicker . Several times here Clark had seen a herd of buffalo making for a new pasture with wolves trailing ; had seen the wolves pounce on any calf that fell a little behind , and watched the enraged mother turn and charge , again and again , but quickly give up and abandon her child and hasten to overtake the herd . How quickly the animal mother forgot ! Once he had seen a furious bull dip his horns , throw up his absurd little tail and charge , at the moment when another bull charged the same wolf from another direction . The luckless beast had been caught between two great skulls of bone , with time left for only one anguished yelp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who had gone hunting and walked too far to return that night : they had managed to shoot a wolf , an old mangy halfstarvedthing , and with its pelt had somehow kept from freezing through the long night . The next afternoon they had tottered in more dead than alive ... . " I expect we better take about thirty men , " Clark said . Lewis stirred under his robes . " I expect so , " he said . He was smokinga strong dry tobacco and looking into the flames . He was thinking of the faraway Rocky Mountains  --  snowcapped even in August , the Big Bellies said  --  and wondering what dangers those mountains held for them . " About thirty , " he said , after a while . " We better make a list one of these days . " Then there was silence , except for the winds , the two captains sitting with all their bedding draped over them , waiting for the morning . P133In spite of the cold it was a busy winter for the white men . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elk and buffalo skin ; and some were making battle-axes and spear points of sheet metal , to trade to the Indians . Nearly every day some were out on the hunt . Lewis spent long hours classifying and arranging his data on Indiantribes ; Clark bent over his maps . They had induced Indian chiefs to sketch for them on white tanned hides or in the earth or on the peeled cabin walls the chief landmarks known to them up the river , the distances in sleeps . But Indian knowledge ran out beyond the Great Falls . After the terrible cold abated , the brave who had been eager to burn his wife brought her and his other wife to the fort . In his sly mind he hoped to do a little business , though he said he had come to apologize . He lamented so and wept so over having stabbed and beaten his woman that he became a nuisance and after a while nobodywould listen to him . Clark was bent over a map , Lewis was operating on a big abscess on a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not flinch when with a razor blade Lewis cut deep into the swollen mess , and then with both hands squeezed the pus out . Then the mother took the boy home . The red people were told to stay away December 25th , Old Bean Poop explaining to them that this was a big medicine day . At daylightguns were fired , and then the swivel guns , and a flag was run tip . Each man was given a glass of rum . From the precious hoard of food a few delicacies were drawn by the mess-sergeants , such asp134flour and dried apples , to go with the elk flesh and boiled corn . After the feast most of the men danced the afternoon and evening away . Some of them looked pretty foolish when dancing with one another : only the other day a group of squaws and of men dressed as squaws had come to trade corn and beans for ribbons and beads . The men dressed as women were known as berdashes , and among Indians , Lewis gravely recorded in his Journal , a berdash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the white men stared at them with scorn ; but not York . Assuming a kingly posture , with folded arms and uptilted head , he had walked around with his haughtiest air , his eyes never once turning to the homosexuals dressed as squaws . For music Cruzatte played his old fiddle , Potts called the turns , Frazier sang his foolish rimes , and Shannon with the bugle tried to emphasize the high notes . Some of the men danced like creatures possessed . York was by himself , a solo figure , his moccasined feet beating out their own music while his eyes rolled upon the two slavegirls . Potts had a mind that ran to obscene verses , sometimes of his own composing : today he was trying to say amusing things about the berdashes but the rum had thickened his stutter and called forth a strong Dutch accent . " Bird ash oh bird ash ! " he called , and some of the men applauded and strained their ears . But Potts got stuck on a word and could only say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convulsively . " Mup what ? " a voice yelled . " Come , John , say mup the pup or something ! " But John could n't get the mup off his tongue . He staggered over and fell on a robe by the fire , his belly heaving . From Tabeau the men had heard that the Mandans had a buffalo medicine dance around the first of the year . It was a fertility dance , really . Its purpose was to quiet the buffalo and bring the big herds in close , so that Indians could kill them with arrows . The cows , it was said , were so suspicious that they would never come in until sacrifices had been made to them . What sacrifices ? the men had asked . Tabeau had rolled his eyes in imitation of York and said that such medicine was not for boys . The captains held aloof from such things but let those men go who wished to . Cruzatte preferred to play his fiddle and dream of things known only to him ; the Fields brothers and John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elk . York had again frozen his feet ; Drewyer had seen enough Indian rites to last him a lifetime ; a few of the men were sick . But a small group of them went to the village , where in theP135largest of the lodges the rites would be held , three days and nights running . They opened with a big feast and the white men decided that they were not hungry . They did n't like the way squaws handled food . It made some of them gag to see the way Indians cut out a buffalo or elk stomach , filled it with water and tipped it up and drank ; or ate animal guts without turning them inside out to wash them ; or gulped down a hunk of liver with the gall bladder attached . Did the squaws ever wash a kettle ? From meat simmering on a fire did they ever dip out the stray insects that came unwarily down ? The white man 's mess left a lot to be wished for but the cooks did dip the bugs out and they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat . He was pretending to cat ; he was making the movements of chewing but all the while he was covertly burying a piece of buffalo neck in the earth floor of the lodge . Centrally located was a huge fire , with Indians seated around it . Over at one side were the prettiest wives of the young bucks . Tabeau , the liar , had said they would be naked but these girls were robed . Across the fire from the young women , so that they all looked at one another through firelight , were their husbands , also seated in a row . At some distance from where the white men sat , over at a far side of the lodge , a number of old men  --  some so old that they were toothless and tottering and almost blind  --  were huffing and roaring ; pawing at the earth to make the dust fly ; bellowing and falling to their hands and butting at the earth with their heads ; and in every way possible imitating the bulls out on the prairie . The white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tabeau tell about it but had never dreamed that the old fools would make such a racket and raise so much dust and knock such loud grunts out of themselves . They were all naked . It was John Potts to whom the thought occurred that the old men-bulls were pretending to be warming up to womencowsin heat . " Mein goat ! " he said . " The old buggers are doing all right , " Will Bratton said . " A fine herd of bulls , " said Ordway . Now one by one the young Indian wives rose from where they sat and , slipping out of their robes , stood for a moment naked and brown . " Holy grandma ! " cried Bratton , his eyes popping out.  | " Nice heifers , " Bob Frazier said . One by one the girls advanced to the fire and scented themselves with odorous herbs and woods burning there . The smell of such things as cedar and sage , the white men now realized , filled the whole lodge . The girls picked up hot twigs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprinkled the ash and heat and fragrance over their naked flesh , turning gracefully round and round in the fire-warmth , the hair of each a long braid that almost touched the floor . They looked so lovely and innocent that even Potts was hushed . When the girls were properly scented and warmed they went one by one in single file to a row of young men , each of whom held in his right hand a stick . A husband had chosen him and given him a stick to mark him , so that his wife would recognize him when she passed down the line . The white men now stared with bugged-out eyes and Potts stuttered in Dutch . " Siisschenl " Potts was breathing , having conquered the word . " 0 Susschen ! " The naked girl passing down the row of young men recognized her stick and , taking hold of it , drew the eager young man to his feet . Together they went away into the lodge-gloom beyond the horses . If it had been warm summertime they would have gone out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen them as thick as haycocks . By the time the last of the girls had taken her man and gone all the white men but Frazier were standing . " You steers , sit down , " he said . Will Bratton sank , murmuring , " I can hear the buffalo coming , " Frazier said . " The cows leading . " The men now listened to the plaintive bellowing of the naked old bulls . As Tabeau had said , they now seemed to be heaping lamentationand sorrow upon their miserable old bones and their impotence . They kept it up after the men had come back with their girls and gone to the row of husbands , where each in turn gravely offered thanks for the favor . That at least is what Tabeau said they did . Tabeau had told them that the fertility rites would continue till morning , the girls changing partners again and again . " Why was n't I born a Mandan ? " Ordway said . Potts was having such trouble with the letter M that several of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , with a gasp , " Mephistopheles ! Ich bin der Geist der stets verneintl "   " Is he talking Mandan ? " Bratton asked , staring at Potts . " Only God and Potts know , " Frazier said . The old bulls were now coming forward , shaking the dust from their imaginary horns and flicking their short imaginary tails . They arranged themselves in a circle not far from the fire and in turn took a few whiffs from a long-stemmed pipe which a young brave in clean new buckskin presented to them . After the pipe had been smoked , one of the husbands came forward and in a wheedling voice addressedhimself to the first old bull in the line . Ordway reached back in memory . Tabeau had said that the husband would whine and wheedle , as though begging the highest favor under heaven  --  begging the old bull to take his beautiful young cow --  " The old bull , " Frazier said , " off into the --  " " Buh-buh-bushes ! " Potts cut in . Now one by one , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheedling tones begged the old bulls to accept the young cows . One by one the young cows came forward , again slipping out of their robes ; and two by two the couples went away into darkness . Some of the bulls were so old and feeble that the cows supported them . " Tabeau said if the old bull isn't --  " " Holy grandma ! " said Bratton in a stricken voice . " Look ! " " He is n't , " George Gibson said . " How many hundred years old is he ? " " Bull , " Frazier said . A couple were returning . The husband went to meet them and again spoke in a high whining voice . " There they go again ! " Bratton said , and Potts began to stutter . He struggled with a word , rested quietly a moment and said , " Himmel . " " I forget how many times , " said Frazier in his duellist 's voice , " they 're allowed to try and fail . Sergeant , was it three ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What happens then ? " asked Bratton . " Why , you dumb steer , the husband feels insulted . Would n't you ? " " You mean would I --  " " Bull , " Frazier said . Sergeant Ordway gave the captains a report of what was done and they wrote it all down for President Jefferson . While Clark wrote , Lewis looked over his shoulder and observed that his spelling todayp138was worse than usual . He supposed that the nature of the subject had disturbed him . " I just do n't understand all of it , " Lewis said . " If the old bull fails so many times the husband throws a robe over him and begs him not to despise him and his wife . What sense does that make ? " " A lot of things the red people do do n't make much sense to me " Lewis turned to Ordway . " Sergeant , how many girls did they offer you ? " " Four , sir . " " They offered four to each one of you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expect , that you must all be pretty old bulls . " " I 'm afraid they did , sir . " When the captains were alone Clark said , " You think the huffier will come close this year ? " " If they do n't , it 's the white bulls will get the blame for it . " " I was thinking that , but Tabeau said the red cows are so attracted to the white bulls that it will be a fine buffalo year . " " Or the black bull . " Clark went on : " I heard someone say these Mandan women want to be faithful to their husbands , and so try to choose a very feeble old man . Does n't that seem to argue for a monogamous preference in women ? " Lewis looked startled . " Possibly , " he said . No question about it , his friend was full of woman-need . Now that the little slave-girl 's baby-time was drawing near , Clark was very kind to her . The other day Old Bean Poop had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the man , his eyes blazing and his hands clenched . He had n't heard what Clark said but he had guessed close to it by the way the squawman had slunk away . P139As the long cold winter approached spring Lewis now and then took his dog and went for a walk . The beast was so infested with fleas that day and night it scratched itself , and its master thought a run in the woods would do it good . But the chief reason he liked to be by himself was habit , that went clear back to the lonely childhood time after the death of his father . When alone he could shake off some of his melancholy and he could think more clearly about the problems that lay ahead . After the turn of the year he went almost daily , when the sun was out and the winds were down . In his mind he would try to number one by one the hazards facing the Corps ; to imagine the map of the country upriver , as the Indians had drawn it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man hardly knew what to believe . Confusionhad become so triumphant that in 1794 Jean Baptiste Trudeau went forth to discover the geographical facts and publish them to the world . Jefferson had sent him Trudeau 's Journal and maps but he and Clark doubted that they had much value . Two years before Trudeau set out , a man by name of Robert Gray , a Boston ship captain , had sailed around Cape Horn in a ship named the Columbia and found and named a river for it . But apparently no man in the world yet knew where the head of that river was . Between the Big Bellies and the Columbia how many tribes of Indianswere there who had never seen a white man 's face ? How far up the Columbia had white men come ? How long was the portage from the headwaters of the Missouri to the headwaters of the Columbia , or any of its tributaries downP140which they might go ? And would the Shoshone Indians trade them horses to make this portage ? Would the men be able to row or tow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corps drew close to the Rocky Mountains ? Was there any pass over those mountains ? Those were some of the questions that he turned over and over in his mind . He thought often of La Salle , who had claimed for France every river running into the Mississippi . This had given him the idea to claim for the United States every stream running into the Missouri , even if any of its headwaters were up in Canada to hell and gone . What British arrogance to be up there anyway ! He supposedJefferson was right , that there would have to be another war with the damned colonizing English before they would stay home and mind their business . He thought he knew what the William Pitts over in London had in mind  --  to push down from Canada to Mexico and claim the whole western part of the continent . And if Jefferson had no more brains than the Federalists they 'd be allowed to do it . It had been those cynics and braggarts who daily heaped scorn on Jefferson 's proposals and did all they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so stupid . They knew what Jefferson was looking at and they were determined to have it . Lewis was determined that his country would have it , even if he died for it . If he and Clark could explore it and claim it , and if that claim then stood , though they were killed on this journey they would live a long life  --  for it would be long in the memory of a gratefulcountry . He liked the thought . It was with him every day when he walked alone --  Our lives will be long in the memory of our people ! Well , the British were arming the Sioux for an attack in the spring . Up north they would be arming the Blackfeet and telling them boats were coming up the river with a lot of booty . It did n't look as though he and Clark had one chance in ten to make it but they would make it or leave their bones out there in the unknown . He was eager to be off . He wished spring would come . One morning he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught a glimpse of Charbonneau . He thought there was somethingqueer in the way the squawman was standing by the leanto , as though listening . Lewis paused to observe him . Had the brute killed one of his women ? Or had he rented them to some of the soldiersand was he now waiting to collect his fee ? Lewis did not suspect that inside the shack a small Indian girl whoP141was little more than a child was moaning in terrible pain . An hour or two later he was in his cabin when a knock fell on the door . On opening it he found Bean Poop there . The squawman wanted to know if the captains had any big medicine for a woman 's pain . Lewis asked what the pain was and Charbonneau said she was trying to have a baby . He did n't suppose he had anything good for childbirth . His mother ought to be here . " Do n't the Indians here have midwives ? You know , old women who can help ? " The squawman shook his dull head no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , yes , Charbonneau said , pulling heavy black brows down to his nose . The rattles of the rattlesnake were good but what man had any ? " Rattlesnake tails ? " said Lewis , looking at him . " I 've never heard of that . " " Tres bon , " said Charbonneau . " Tres jude maidisan . " Lewis told him to go to the villages and find some , but the snow was deep and Old Bean Poop was lazy . Knowing that he 'd never walk even a mile for so trivial a thing as a woman 's life , Lewis again stood in thought . " Thunderationl " he cried suddenly . Was this the princess who was going to guide them to her people ? Charbonneau nodded . Lewis hastened to Ordway and told him to take two or three men and go to the villages for rattlesnake rattles . The princess was in childbirth and her man said rattles were the only thing that would help her . " I would n't judge , Captain , they 'd do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Neither would I but it 's a world of mysteries . Move fast , for she 's in great pain . " Lewis would have gone to Clark but Clark was away hunting . He was waiting by his fire when otter-girl came to him , timid and shrinking but determined to have him go with her . She led him to the hut and he looked down on Sacajawea , lying on robes by the fire . tier face was contorted by pain but when she recognized the captain she forced a smile . Lewis knelt by her and saw the pallor in her face and the sweat over her face and throat . He felt a surge of pity . Gentlywith a finger he traced the line of one of her brows and patted one of her clenched hands . If Lucy Marks were here she 'd knowp142what to do . Surely there were herbs in this area for this sort of thing . Surely there were midwives . He returned to the cabin and was smoking when the otter-girl came again rapping on his door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood and listened . He knew that an Indian , like a horse , made little sound of pain until the pain became unbearable . He could hear her moaning and knew that she must be suffering terribly . Never in his life had he been on the scene when a woman gave birth , or ever thought of the ordeal until this moment . He had supposed that Indian women suffered only a little  --  but then this one was a child , so young and small . Hearing her moans , he began to feel anger against the child-raping squawman and in an irrational momentconsidered having him put in irons . Then his thoughts mellowed : would it be a girl or a boy ? Let 's see  --  it would be one-half Snake Indian , and either one-half French or one-quarter French and one-quarter something else . Bean Poop had been hoping for a boy and had already chosen a name for it  --  Jean Baptiste Charbonneau . Where was the lazy wife-beater , anyway ? Lewis wondered , looking round him . Well , he guessed there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordeal , for reasons known only to God . He returned to his cabin , with otter-girl slinking after him . In the afternoon he went again to the leanto and entered . There they were , two child-slaves by the fire  --  two almost friendless creaturesfar from their own people , one helpless and one dying . That 's what he thought when he knelt and looked at the girl 's face . She did n't smile at him this time . In the eyes of a dying beast he had seen the same look of glazed-over pain , the same **26;10829;TOOLONG he saw in this child 's eyes . Her pallor had deepened to ghastliness in her copper-colored skin . The hair across her forehead was matted with sweat . He hurried outside and sent one of the men to find Juice-um . " In the first village , I think , and see if anyone there has rattlesnake rattles . Hurry ! " " Yes , Captain . " " Or any medicine for childbirth . Our squaw is dying . " While the man was gone Lewis stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If she died he guessed they 'd have to take otter-girl , though a princess would suit their purpose better . He wished Clark was here.  |p143Juice-urn  came in a few minutes . He said the thing to give the squaw was snake rattles . He had brought some with him . " You really mean that ? " asked Lewis , looking into the Frenchman 's eyes . Rattles , he said , never failed . There was a magic property in them that made birth-giving easy . " How do you give them to her ? " Just powder the rattles , mix the powder with water and pour it down her . Juice-um broke off two rings and crushed them . Lewis handed him a cup half-filled with water . Juice-urn then dropped the crushed Cuttlebone into the water and stirred it in with a dirty forefinger . Lewis took the cup and hastened to the girl . Kneeling , he reached under her shoulders with a hand to bring her up , saying , " Here , drink this . " He gave her the cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Otter-girl was looking at his face and at the cup , back and forth . Sacajawea was lying on her side , her face to the fire . It was cold in here , Lewis said , looking over at the woodpile . He threw wood on the fire and went outside . In his cabin he took off his heavy coat , sat by the fire and filled his pipe . He had smoked only a few minutes when otter-girl knocked on the door . Lewis followed her to the shed . He took one look at the new wet infant and returned to his cabin , too astonished to speak or think . When two days later Clark returned from the hunt , half-dead with fatigue and half-frozen , Lewis said , " A child was born . " " In Bethlehem , I think , " Clark said . " At Fort Mandan . " Lewis told him about it and said , " You think the rattles did any good ? " " It would be hard to say . Superstitious people get medicine out of queer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two rings and ten minutes later the babe is born . " It was a boy . Clark decided to call him Pomp . He thought that meant the firstborn . Lewis said the father had already named him . lk was Jean Baptiste . " I 'll call him Pomp , " Clark said . " What if this frail mother gets sick on our hands ?  --  or the baby ? And just now it occurs to me that the other girl will follow us . She'sP144pregnant too . Out yonder somewhere in the unknown we 'll find ourselvesmanaging a nursery . " " I expect we might , " Clark said . Charbonneau took a fancy to himself after the child was born . He put an eagle feather in his hair . He smeared coaldust and vermilion over the unbearded parts of his face . He then presented himself to the captains and said he was not going west with them on the terms they had offered . They looked at him and Clark said sternly , " What do you mean ? " The squawman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . An interpreter was above that . He would do no work that he felt was beneath him , for he was , after all , a special person , and not a cook or wood-chopper or kettle-washer . Furthermore , if for any reason he wished to leave the Corps and return , he was to be provisionedand given a canoe . " Anything more ? " Clark asked . Charbonneau said he might think of other things . Clark said to Lewis , " The traders have been talking to him . " " The English . I think the English are the locust plague God dropped on Egypt . " " They probably would love to have all our men desert . " Clark turned to the squawman . " So the British have been talking to you . " Charbonneau gave a vigorous denial . Yes , there were some other matters --  " Never mind ! " Clark snapped . " Get your bedding and stuff there and get to hell out of this fort ! And move fast or I 'll have you thrown out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , a rare thing for him . He was speechless . " Go on , " Lewis said , " get out . " Clark strode to the shack and a moment later pitched the squawman'sthings outside . " Mee vives , " Charbonneau was saying to Lewis . " His vives . He 's decided he loves them . " " Go , " Clark said , pointing to Charbonneau 's things . Sullen and angry , the squawman picked up his things and left the fort . Five days later he sent an emissary of good will , a Frenchman who had come upriver with the party , to say that he was deeply sorry . He was ready to go a toutes jambes ; he would do anything theyp145wanted him to do  --  wash pots , wade rivers , pull tow-ropes . He 'd give them no trouble at all . " A toutes jambes , " said the Frenchman , grinning . " Ah toot what ? " asked Lewis . The Frenchman pumped his legs up and down as though running at top speed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The squawman came and this time he had no feather in his hair , no paint , no swagger . The captains asked him if he would abide by their terms all the way to the ocean and back , and with comical politeness Charbonneau said he would . " Oui-suh , " he said , and bowed to one captain . " Oui-suh , " he said , and bowed to the other . " All right , " Lewis said , " back to your vives . " A day or two later Clark was surprised to find both slave-girls out gathering wood . Going to the shed to have a look at the child , he found it alone , lying on a robe close to the fire . He moved it back a little . It looked to him abnormally small and premature . It looked half-cooked . He doubted that it would live . But he now had graver worries than that . P146Some of the best hunters had been sent down the river after elk and had returned unexpectedly to report that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose from the meat-sleds . The Indians had made off with two of the horses , and with two knives which they had torn from the grasp of two of the men . Lewis said , " The British are back in the brush dogging them on . They 're getting brave . " " Feeling us out , " Clark said . The captains sent messengers posthaste to the Indian villages to tell the chiefs to come over , with all their fighting men , armed and ready for war . They were told that Captain Lewis and his soldiers would leave at daybreak . Big White came over with a minor chief and a few old men . He said all the fighting men were out hunting and had taken with them all the weapons . " Same old story , " Lewis said to Clark . " I 'll go without them . " And so at sunrise he was off with twenty-four men for Sioux country , accompanied by a few red men with bows and arrows , spears and battle-axes . After the party had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pleading snowblindness ; and the next day another Indian went home , with one of the white men whose feet had frozen . Lewis pushed on for several days but there was no sign of the enemy . Convinced that the Sioux had all fled south or east , he gathered up the flesh that the hunting-party had left  --  what remained of thirty-six deer and fourteen elk  --  and returned to the fort . The Sioux had fled but just the same they were getting bolder ev/ery day . The captains decided that they should get the boats out of the ice and be ready to go the moment the river opened . When spring came they had no doubt the Sioux would appear in force  --  and all the Mandans would be far away hunting ! The river ice had frozen to such a depth that Paddy and his men found it impossible to chop through it . They would chop through a foot or more and then come to a sheet of water , with another depth of ice below it . They would stand knee-deep in water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another level of water and a third layer of ice . Would it be like this clear to the river 's bottom ? They supposed it would but they went on chopping day after day . They were still trying to free the boats when Joseph Gravelines came to the captains with a letter from Tabeau . Lewis read it aloud to Clark . It said that the Ricara Indians were now feeling friendly toward the Mandans and Minnetarees and wondered if these two nations would join them in a common front against the Sioux . " Good news , " Lewis said , looking at Gravelines . " The rest of it , Captain , is n't so good . The Sissetons and all the upper bands of the Tetons , yes , it is said even the Yanktons , are all coming north against the Mandans . They 've sworn by all their manitous to kill every white man here . " " That must mean both of us , " Lewis said drily to Clark . To Gravelines : " How many warriors will they have ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there 'll be three bands of the upper Tetons . The Yanktons probably have four or five hundred fighters . I do n't know how many the Sisseton Sioux have . You could stand them off in your fort . " " They 'd lay siege to us , of course . " " Oh yes . " " And starve us out or burn us out . " " Either . " " Where they getting their arms ? " " Several places but the British chiefly . " A man named Cameron , Gravelines said , over on St. Peters River , was arming them . He was mad because three of his men had been killed by the Chippewas . The only friend the white man had down the river was Black Buffalo . " What could he do ? " " Nothing . He might keep the lower band quiet awhile . " " You say the Rees are on our side ? "  | " No , just not on the Sioux side . " The gang that robbed the white hunters , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way back down they had stopped at the Ricaras to boast about it . The Ricaras would n't give them anything to eat and you could n't insult an Indian worse than that . The Ricaras had then added insult to insult by givingthe Sioux a lecture . " I expect , " Lewis said , remembering Clark 's lecture to the wifestabber , " that did a lot of good . " Clark asked , " Just about when will they be coming ? " " They 're watching the ice . They know you ca n't go before the ice runs . " How long will it take the river to clear after the ice breaks ? " Gravelines said they could proceed even though ice was running  --  even though a lot of ice was running  --  if they had good steersmen . They could keep close to the banks , for the ice was naturally drawn to the center by the swifter current there . It might be possible for them to slip away upriver while the Sioux were still waiting . " That looks like about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to send the big boat back down the river . Will they try to take it ? " " I do n't see how they could in high water . " They might be fooled , Gravelines said , into thinking the whole party had turned back down . " They 'll have spies up here , " Clark said . The situation again seemed so grave that the captains decided not to tell their men that the Sioux were coming after their scalps . They warned them to be very watchful when out hunting . They put only their most dependable men on guard . The carpenters were busy making crude boxes and crates to hold the materials for Mr. Jefferson , which would be sent down on the keelboat . The blacksmiths were busy making axes , tomahawks and spear points for upriver trade . Not a man except Charbonneau was idle , from the time he rolled out of his robes at daylight until he went to bed . There was an atmosphere of menace and expectancy but the morale of the men was high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one another , looking into the west . Morning , noon and night the captains inspected the broad river for signs of ice breakup . When it came , late in March , they were surprised to see so many dead buffalo floating among the ice floes . The stupid herds were crossing the river far upstream and the ice was giving way under them and dropping them in . Thinking of them , Lewis could imagine how the astonished and terrified creaturesp149swam round and round among the great floes , looking for a channelout ; how they weakened little by little and sank ; how they came to the surface and swam again with their last desperate strength ; and sank again and again came up . Or so it was , according to the squawman . In some years thousands of them drowned when the ice cracked . In some years the river was almost black with them for miles and miles . The captains were even more surprised by what the red people now did . They preferred putrid to fresh meat . To get the kind they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river after the floating buffalo ; leaping with astounding agility from floe to floe , and sometimes , Clark observed , trusting their weight and their lives to a piece of ice not two feet square . He watched them one afternoon and marveled  --  marveled at the dexterity and daring with which an Indian fetched a beast to the bank , after looping a rope over its horns or leg ; dragging it after him between the ice-islands , as he himself leapt from one cake to another . Then he saw that out on the plains on both sides of the river the old dead grass was afire . Were these fires Indian signals ? He hastened to ask the squawman . Charbonneau merely shrugged . As the time for the departure drew near he sulked or put on airs . Ile wanted the captains to take all his wives along , and in any case the two girls ; and as though to encourage him in his importuning , the otter-girl wept with hysterical abandon almost day and night . She saw the men loading the boats after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked upriver or across the prairie toward her home . And one day when her hunger for her people was greater than her awe of Chief Long Knife she flung herself down before him and , babbling and weeping , begged to be taken along . Lewis at the moment was busy with a list of things going to President Jefferson . He ignored her , groveling there on the earth . Clark was sitting not far from Lewis and she now turned to him . In her primitive Ignorant childlike way she tried to show him how alone and friendlessand helpless she was , and how dependent on his mercy . After a few moments Clark looked down at her . He gazed at her for perhaps half a minute , observing in his painstaking way that her braid of hair was not so long as Jawey 's ; that her throat , convulsedby sobs and grief , seemed thin and undernourished ; that her buckskin garments and moccasins were all old and ragged ; that one hand flung out was clenched , the fingers on the other working inp150and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement in the fingers that made him realize how deeply the girl was suffering . Lord , 0 Lord , he wished he could take her but it was simply out of the question . It was more folly than he liked to think of even to take the other one and her infant . He clasped the girl 's upper arms and brought her to her feet . Then she stood , head down , shrinking and trembling before him . With a hand he moved down over the curve of her belly , forcing her eyes to look down , to see for herself that she was five or six months with child ; to understand that they could not take a pregnant woman on a long dangerous journey , where every man would be risking his life , and the first duty of the commanders was the welfare of their men . But she did not understand . Suddenly she slunk back as though he had struck her and went swiftly out of sight . It was then that he felt the most pain and the most pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duty , Captain , I 've decided is the most unpleasant thing in life . " Clark looked away for a moment to the thicket where the girl had vanished and again bent to his work . They had drawn up a list of the things that were to be sent to President Jefferson and were looking at it : Box Skins of the Male and female Antelope , with their Skeletons do 2 horns and ears , of the Blacktail , or Mule Deer , , A Martin Skin containing the Skin of a weaseland three Small squirels of the Rocky Mountains &; the tail of a Mule deer fully grownSkeletons of the Small , or burrowing wolf of the Prairies , the Skin haveing been lost by accedent. 2 Skeletons of the White Hair , .

" The hen ? " " He eats anything , at least once . He 's what the French call a gourmet . He even brought a French chef from Paris . " " Too bad we do n't have a braro for him . " By braro the captains meant the common prairie badger . " Or a beaver tail . He 'd love that . " Clark said nothing . He did not have his friend 's catholic taste in foods . He did n't care for the wood-hard fat of the beaver tail . " Wonder what he 'll think of the magpie , " Lewis said , still looking at the list . " He 'll love the specimens of plants one to sixty . " " And the earth , salts and minerals , " Clark said . " And the big horns . He hoped we 'd find monsters out here . " Lewis carefully rolled the list inside buckskin . " Think of what we 'll have to send him by the time we get back here . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five barrels left  --  and our twenty-eight bushels of meal and our fifty kegs of pork and our barrels of flour we 'll have room for a lot of specimens . " " If we do n't have long portages . " " Imagine the things we 'll find , " said Lewis , looking up . " All the things no white man has ever seen since Adam . Fruits and vegetables they 've never tasted ; minerals they 've never used . " He was looking into the west , his imagination filling . " Maybe even women , " he said , turning mischievous eyes on his friend . " That reminds me : are all our men in shape ? " " No , not all . About two-thirds of them . " " Well , I hope to God we have no Indians all the way to the Blackfeet . The Blackfeet will be more interested in scalps than renting their wives out . Has Newman been to see you ? " " The other day . " " You know , he stands acquitted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we flogged him but we ca n't take a man who was mutinous . " Clark was silent . He was looking at all the parcels which they were sending to the President . Lewis said , " I suppose he begged you to let him go . " " He promised everything under the sun . " " Do n't all the men seem eager to be off ? " " Very . " " Except Shaubonah . " In their journals the captains spelled thep153squawman 's name variously and changed their pronunciation with each change of spelling . " We may be sorry we ever took Shobono . " Privately Lewis was not yet convinced that Sacajawea would not be more bother than she was worth , what with a child that seemed to have been born full of colic and an amazing capacity to make hideous noise all night . For many nights now it had awakened him time and again , and when he slept he dreamed of otter-girl . That creature was so pitiable , as the time to leave drew near , that she melted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the boats had been loaded and during the day she sat back from them and wept . George Shannon had looked at her a full minute , his applecheeksbunched up and his blue eyes narrowed . This girl made him think of his father . Paddy had given her a few beads , John Colter a moccasin awl . Alex Willard had said , " I never loved my people that much . " When the keelboat was loaded and ready to go down the river it had fifteen men aboard , including Tabeau and Gravelines and four of their men . Among them was John Newman , who refused to look upstream any more . In command was a corporal named Richard Warfington , with whom the captains had entrusted their maps and reports , their letters to friends , and the many things for the President . Two men were sent down the river to light signal fires if they saw the Sioux approaching . What was holding the Sioux back ? Lewis said , " They 're not half as brave as they think they are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , emotions in some of the men rose to the surface . Not a one but sensed that this was a historic moment . Not a one of those going upstream but had wondered a hundred times if he would ever come back . A few were retracing the sixteen hundred miles back to St. Louis . Thirty-one men , a girl and a child were facing into a vast unknown from which such experienced old hands as Tabeau thought they would never return . On the keelboat when in late afternoon it turned down the river there were faces not hard to read , and hands waving goodbye that were not hard to read either : both said that it was not goodbye hut farewell . . . . The moment the keelboat passed out of sight round a bend , all the members of the Corps , except Lewis himself , climbed into the pirogues and six cottonwood dugouts and headed upstream . Becausep154emotion had been mounting in him Lewis had said he would walk , for he had to be alone now . For fifteen years he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The long hitter winter was behind him , the Sioux were behind him ; and ahead of him was an adventure of such magnitude and dangers , but also of such promise , that his eyes were a little misty , his throat a little choked . Oh , he was a sentimentalman and he knew it , but he had seen the emotion in Will Clark too , and in most of the men ! To try to force some of the emotion down he turned his thoughts to the fleet out there . Well , it was not so imposing as that which Columbus had , or Captain Cook , but it was darned good to look at , moving yonder under its sail and oars . Columbus and Cook must have viewed with pride , he was thinking , but also with anxiety , for the safety and lives of their crew , or the possibility of mutiny . All winter he had carefully watched these twenty-eight men ( he did not include Shobono ) whom they had picked for the journey and he was sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiner . No , nor one who would ever know when he was licked , not even York . They were bold resourceful adventurous men and he was proud of them . He expected that he would be mighty proud before this journey was done . We are now  --  so his thoughts were running , as he kept a sharp watch for skulking Indians and warning fires  --  we are now about to penetrate a country possibly two thousand miles wide , on most of which the foot of civilized man has never trod ; and whether for good or evil , the experiment will have to determine . Out there are eight small vessels which contain every article by which we expect to subsistor defend ourselves . The state of a man 's mind gives coloring to events , when his imagination wanders into the future ; and so now the picture that opens before me is a most pleasing one , entertaining , as I surely do , the most confident hope of succeeding in a voyage which has been my darling project for the last fifteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this moment of departure as the happiestof my life . .. . So his thoughts ran as he walked down the bank , his rifle across his arm , his pistol and dagger and sword at his waist , his dog at his heels . The Sioux had not come . They simply were not half as brave as they pretended to be . He was never to know that whole bands of them were at this moment moving to the river , there to get ready for the massacre of the white party . He would never know what rage and frustration they were to feel on learning that the white menp155had gone . His dog knew but he was never to know that otter-girl followed him for miles up the bank , always slipping into hiding when he looked back . His thoughts were soaring far above Sioux Indians and slave-girls . He had written a long letter to his President , saying that he expected to see him at Monticello in September of 1806 . It was now April 7th of 1805 . He had concluded : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and entertain , therefore , the most sanguine hopes of complete success . . . . My inestimable friend and companion , captain Clark , has also enjoyed good health generally . At this moment every individual of the party is in good health and excellent spirits , zealously attached to the enterprise , and anxious to proceed ; not a whisper of discontent or murmur is to be heard among them . ... With such men I have everything to hope for , and but little to fear .... " He had , he well knew , many things to fear but he was not the sort to tell his President that . Besides , when feeling so elated and triumphant , he looked at his enemies and adversaries and found them contemptibly weak . Now and then he smiled when a thought amused him . There was Paddy 's Journal , a part of which Lewis had read . He was recalling the words : " We ought to be prepared now , when we are about to renew our voyage , to give some account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narratives of feats of love as well as of arms . Though we could furnish a sufficient number of entertaining stories and pleasant anecdotes , we do not think it prudent to swell our Journal with them ; as our views are directedto more useful information . Besides , as we are yet ignorant of the dangers which await us , and the difficulty of escape , should certain probable incidents occur , it may not be inconsistent with good policy to keep the Journal of as small and portable a size as circumstances will make practicable . It may be observed generally that chastity is not very highly esteemed by these people .... " That was n't the way Paddy had written it and least of all the way lie had spelled it but that was the sense and rather sententious manner of it ; and as the captain recalled how evasive  --  oh , how prudent !  --  it had been , his smile spread and twitched at all his features . The other sergeants and the privates who were keeping journals were also prudent . It was well to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed to more useful information , and the squaws were as incidental in their lives as their meals . Certain probable incidents ? What had the sergeant meant ? Possibly the monstrous gray bearsp156which , the Indians had said , they would encounter before they had gone far . Perhaps the weird chilling sounds which the Big Bellies said came right out of the Rocky Mountains , as though all the sufferingspirits of the doomed were confined there . Or maybe he had in mind the Blaekfeet . Thought of the Blackfeet always took the smile off Sacajawea 's face . Well , they would face many dangers . Not a man of them doubted it ; not one of them but Shobono was afraid . They would now all forget that for an old tobacco box one of the men had spent a night with the daughter of the head chief of the Mandan nation . They would forget what Paddy in his record had called the old bodd and her punks , who could be found , he had written , not only in Indian villages , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captains would forget that the head chief of the Minnetarees had come to them with his handsomest wife and begged them to use her a few nights ; that Big White for one tomahawk had offered them the choice of his wives , sisters and daughters ; that old Evil Eye had hinted that it would be nothing but a world of berdashes if white men refused to accept the red man 's ways . They would forget all these things , for these things were as trivial as last night 's bones thrown on the fire , or this morning 's ashes left from the breakfast . A vast unknown was about to be entered ; half a continent about to be claimed . It was Bob Frazier who had coined the cry , Mister Jefferson , here we go ! It was Frazier out in a pirogue leading the singers now : " Mr. Jefferson , here we go , Singing our boat-song sweet and low .... " The problems would be many but during this late afternoon and evening walk he wanted to think of something else . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be at its spring flood and running like a thing out of its mind ; that the Sioux would be waiting for them when they came back down , if they ever came hack down ; that the high white Rocky Mountains might be impassable ; that they might enter barren areas where there was nothing to eat . A Big Belly chief had said that no man alive could cross the tall frozen mountains that were formed of such jagged stone that they were called the Rockies . He had said that they would come to terriblewaterfalls on the Missouri around which they could never portage . He had said that the Blackfeet could advance against themp157with two thousand men all armed with rifles . He had heard it all duringthe winter , he had heard it all . He had heard it said so many times that they would all perish that he was sick and tired of hearing it . To all the men chosen to go , except the squawman and the Negro , the captains had given an account of the hazards and dangers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and had said that if any man among them wanted to go back home , or remainwith the Mandans --  It was then that Robert Frazier , said to have been a fencing-master in New England , had got to his feet , salutedthe captains , and cried , " Mister Jefferson , here we go ! " The men had taken up the cry . They had all shown such zeal and spirit , such eagerness to be off , such contempt for danger , that it had been a carefully considered statement when Lewis told the Presidentthat there was no murmur of discontent among them , that they were in excellent spirits and eager to proceed . Oh , but his mind was filled with light this evening , his heart with joy ! This had been his dream for more than ten years , his President 's for more than twenty . He and Clark would make that dream come true or somewhere on the broad continental depth of it they would leave their bones . . . . " We may not ever return , we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ! " The men , were still singing out on the river.  |p158They  did not at once see the last of the Indians . On their second day out hundreds of them swarmed to the riverbank , shrieking , holdingup gifts of corn and beans , and then rushing along the bank after them . After they had pitched camp a Mandan brave walked in with an attractive young squaw . He said his wife wanted to go with the party because she had been bewitched by the black white man . Lewis summoned Charbonneau . " Tell him to get her out of here . " " Walla ! " cried the squawman , whose French was almost as bad as his English . He pointed downriver in the direction of the Mandan villages . He waved the squaw back home but she slunk from him , her eyes looking round for York . Almost an hour passed before the camp was free of her , and then for some time the men could see her in brush along the riverbank , peering out . Reuben Fields said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blackfeet scalp him . " By turns one of the captains remained with the boats and the other walked up the bank , or inland to explore ; and with unflagging zeal they made notes of everything they saw  --  not only the daily observationsof longitude , latitude , elevations , wind and weather , but of tributary streams , animal and plant life , soils and minerals . Within only a few days Lewis had examined and tasted and smelled a hundreddifferent plants , including sage , wormwood , hyssop , elm , juniper ; and many which he could not identify , such as the prairie sagebrush , which he called southernwood , and another that had the smell and taste of camphor , yet was a favorite with the antelope . He noted the appearance of salts , coal , sulphur , pumice stone ; and of watersp159that he called " bitumenous " because they had the color of lye and the flavor of glauber salts . He found stones which , he said in his Journal , had the appearance of wood first carbonated and then petrefyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered has that effect on many vegitable substances . " He found trees twenty inches in diameterwhich beaver had felled , and concluded that their only food was hark , that their favorite barks were cottonwood and willow . Clark was prowling inland and finding old Assiniboine camps , with their empty whisky kegs ; great herds of half-starved buffalo , elk , deer and antelope ; tens of thousands of geese feeding on the first green grass of the prairie ; the eggs and nests of magpies , the home of the booted owl and the prairie dog . Lewis often recalled Jefferson 's wish , that with great pains and accuracythey would observe all these things , for others as well as for themselves . To guard against possible loss the captains were to make several copies ( " He must have thought we 'd have nothing to do but write , " Lewis had grumbled to Clark ) , one of which was to be " on the paper of the birch , as less liable to injury from damp than commonpaper . " They were to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your journal , notes &; observations of every kind . " They were to encourage all their men to keep journals , and had done so , but only the sergeants , and Privates Whitehouse and Frazier , had writtenanything down . The plan was to be off at daybreak , before breakfast . Because the men preferred meat freshly killed usually one of the captains with a couple of the best hunters would go up the river ahead of the boats , looking for game . If they were able to kill meat for breakfast , the boats would then stop at the scene of the kill , and while some of the men built fires the cooks and their assistants would cut off the choicest portions and dig marrow out of the bones , to season the broth or to use as butter on bread , if at the moment they had bread . When the meat was cooked the men would fall to and eat with appetitesso ravenous that their captains would have marveled if they too had not been as hungry as wolves in January . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . With her child standing up her back in its cradle she set off with a sharpened stick in search of wild artichokes , which the desert gophers gathered and stored underground . She would go over the earth looking for signs and probing , and on finding a cache would dig it out . Lewis ate of the boiled roots and thought them a pleasantP164to step . The thorns went right through your elkskin moccasins , through a double thickness of deer skin . Captain Clark did not handletow-lines but walked where he pleased , yet night after night the men had seen him sitting by the fire digging thorns out of his swollen feet . The thorns seemed to carry a poison , for the sores festered and the feet puffed up like sick things . Captain Lewis had tried to solve the problem by putting over his moccasins a covering of thick buffalo hide . " The Indians never mentioned the prickly pears , " one of the men said . " What else did n't they tell us about ? " " Plenty , " another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smell . It smelled of tall mountains and tall mountain snows ; of herds of buffalo and bear and elk , and whole rivers full of beaver and otter and muskrat ; of millions of acres of conifers , vines , ferns , berry bushes , pine grasses and leafmold that was older than Adam . You took a handful of water and you thought , Where in the world did this come from ?  --  from what creek or river a thousand or two thousand miles away , there in the west or northwest or southwest , or even straight north or south . Two drops side by side might have come from two snowbanks ten mountain ranges apart . It was good water , for though cold and muddy it was clean , it tasted pure and it smelled of wonderful things . Of the two captains it was Clark who pushed inland most of the time . The philosophic and meditative Lewis often watched his men laboring in the water , unobserved by them ; saw the grimacing of their features ; noted how sharply they sucked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck an enemy ; and guessed at their thoughts when they stared across the wide muddy stream or gazed upriver or down . In the evenings he watched them around the campfires . They were failing  --  it took no sharp observer to see that . All the men on the tow-lines had lost weight and color . Lewis had supposed that when they got away from the squaws they would gain in vigor and mental alertness , but the cold water and sharp stones and prickly pear , and the thought of interminable distances ahead , were taking toll of spirit and stamina , though not a man complained , at least not in camp . In fact , Lewis thought their spirits remarkably high , for with whoops and yells they daily expressed their contempt for the Black-P165feet , to the amazement of the Indian girl and the near-panic of her man . When not watching the men and worrying about them Lewis liked to stray inland to see what was to be seen . One evening a buffalocalf , separated from its mother , came loping toward him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost touching his leather jacket . When Lewis paused and turned , the calf 's black eyes looked up at him , full of animal-wonder . I expect , Lewis thought , looking at the little fellow , that I do n't smell much like his mother . He must be troubled about that , yet seems ready to accept me . The calf 's trust in him and the queer wondering way it looked at him filled him with an emotion of tenderness . When he reached out to touch the woolly face the calf backed away , still looking at him , still big with wonder . How strange ! Lewis thought , musing . Is he lonely even as men are lonely ?  --  for see , his eyes tell me that he does n't like my odor ; such sense as he has must tell him that I am not his mother ; yet here he is , he has followed me clear to the boat ; and as I shove off , there he stands on the bank , wondering why I have left him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched a mother desert her calf when the wolves pressed in . Lewis had seen the same thing . He had more than once seen a herd of buffalo fleeing before a pack of wolves and had observed , with grim humor , that if a mother had to choose between her child and the herd she always chose the herd . She would fall behind a little and show anxiety for her baby , which , though unable to keep up , was doing the best he could . She would let off low bellows of what seemed to be encouragement or alarm . She would even dash at the wolf-pack and scatter it . But , watching her , Lewis sensed how fear overpowered mother-concern , for after a while she dashed forward to rejoin the herd and her child was pounced upon and torn to pieces almost before his last cries ceased . This sort of experience always went deep into Lewis and left him in a thoughtful mood . He would stroll over to the spot where the calf had been pulled down  --  the wolves had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would see only bloodstained earth and the wet bones . There was nothing else , not even a piece of hide . Here , the captain would muse , looking down at the bones and blood , here only a few moments ago a baby buffalo was trying desperately to keep up with its mother . She is yonder in the herd somewhere , and though she may look round her and smell of other babies , though she may cry for it a few times , though somewhere in her dark animalp166soul there may be an emotion akin to pain , an emptiness akin to loss , in three or four days she will have forgotten all about it . The human mother takes only a little longer ... . So it was the world over , he supposed . There were those in Washingtonand elsewhere who wondered about him and Clark and their men  --  where they were now and if still alive , or if they had all been slaughtered by the Blackfeet or had starved to death in the Rockies . People would say only , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget them . The mothers might remember longest , and next to them , Tom Jefferson , for if they all perished his dream might perish too . A little buffler calf , Lewis thought , leaning on his gun and looking down at the stains : only a little while ago it was so warm and full of living , so eager , so friendly to all things ; and now it was only a smear on the earth , a few bones , a skull with the eyes sucked out , its flesh and most of its blood digesting in wolf bellies ... . Such thoughts always made him wonder if he ought to feel shame for himself . Lord , but he was such a melancholy and sentimental fellow , under his mask of stern military discipline ! He would not have wanted the men , no , nor his friend Will , no , not even his mother to look into these depths . He took his pipe out and filled it and then thrust it back into a leather pocket . He laid the gun across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , a philosopher , but possibly , he thought , not strange to the men , that the wild animals here were not wild at all : while buffalo , elk or antelope were feeding he could walk up and almost touch them , without exciting fear or alarm , so far as he could tell . Indeed , the animals frequently came close to the men , to determine , it seemed , what sort of creatures they were . He was beginning to understand that the beasts called wild were not wild until the loud gun-noise and killing men made them so . He understood that for these gentle peaceable things , the milk-givers that fed only on plant life , men were another and deadlier species of the wolf . Or would be after they discovered what men were like ! When the captains determined by their calculations that they must be close to the Roche Jaune , or Yellow Stone River , Lewis took four men and went on ahead , and soon came to it . An emotion of elation filled him : no white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been up the Missouri this far ! Climbing to an eminence , he gazed for a few minutes at the huge herds of buffalo , elk , deer and antelope all around him ; at hills so fantastically and grotesquely eroded that he found it hard to believe them real ; and then at the broad valley formed by the two rivers . There was more growth on the river bottomshere than downstream , indicating for him that the soil was more fertile . He decided to go up the Yellow Stone River a couple of miles and camp there for the night . He would explore roundabout while waiting for Clark and his party . Yes , he reflected again , while prowling through thickets of cottonwood , willow and briar , this was a landmarkin their journey , an hour of triumph . No white men , not even the boldest trappers , had ever dared come this far . Francis Labiche said he had come almost to this point . When Lewis said , " Did you find any of the yellow stones ? " Labiche had been silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lewis muttered , " Roash Shoan , the French call it , meaning yellow stones . " The French had never seen yellow stones but had based their name on what Indians had told them . If there were any yellow stones , he supposed they must be on up the river , possibly at some ford where the Big Bellies crossed . The next morning Lewis decided to send the intrepid and adventurousJoe Fields up the river , ordering him to proceed as far as he could , with time to return to camp before dark . " And watch for yellowstones . If you find any , bring two or three back . " About noon Lewis heard the firing of guns , and concluded that Clark and his party had reached the junction . Toward evening he went down the river and found the main party encamped on a point of land where the two rivers came together . All the men seemed to be in gay spirits for having come so far . The captains spoke together privately and decided as a gesture of celebration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After the men had drunk their liquor and eaten their supper , Cruzatte played the violin , and upon the bank of the wide rivers the men danced and sang around a big campfire , indifferent alike to the monstrous grizzled bears prowling in the dusk and the BlackfootIndians who might be watching out in the night . Her child at her breast , the Shoshone girl looked at the men and marveled . She was scared to death , now that the party was so close to Blackfoot country . Why were the captains so unafraid ? They were sitting in bright firelight writing in their journals , each a perfect target . Every plan was a perfect target as he capered around the fire . She thoughtthe chiefs must have some big medicine that they were keepinghidden.  |p1668Joe  Fields came in , carrying a horn from a mountain sheep . The captains examined and measured it and then listened to his story : he had gone up the yellow river about eight miles and had found veins of coal , river islands densely covered with timber , and bighornedanimals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " But you found no yellow stones ? " " No , sir . " " None that even looked a little yellow ? " " No , sir . They all look just like the ones here . " Lewis turned to Clark . " Well , they call them Blackfeet but it 's said they have the whitest feet of all Indians . They call the MinnetareesBig Bellies but they 're the slimmest Indians I 've ever seen . I expect the yellow stones are probably gray . " " I expect so , " Clark said . " And the mountain of rock salt , Captain , " said Frazier , " is a pile of basalt . " " I would n't be surprised at all . " The men with wounded feet stopped dancing after a while but eight or nine others danced until almost midnight . Then they rolled into their blankets and fell asleep to the lapping of river waters and the crying of wolves . " Even if its stones are gray , " said Lewis , speaking over to Clark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you say it is ? " " Eight hundred and fifty-eight yards , including its sandbar. "  |p169George  Shannon , whose ear was the best in the party , called her Sak-a-jaw-we-a and Clark called her Jawey . Jawey was no bigger than a minute : she was under five feet in height and she weighed less than a hundred pounds but before the month of June came in the captains decided that she was worth her weight in blue beads . She was never in the way and she was always busy . She gathered edible roots when she could find them ; dressed skins ; made or mended garments and moccasins ; and day after day pointed out the plants that grew in her homeland . She came to Clark with a branch of a currant bush and made him understand that this was a common fruit where her people lived and hung in clusters like grapes . She was eager to learn English and Clark was teaching her a few words when he had time . Jawey was astonished night after night to see the men dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty feet into the darkness and high into the heavens . Such a great room of light would be visible to the Blackfeet for miles and miles . Were the captains terribly bold or terribly stupid ? Day after day she looked back down the river and saw the smoke of the last night 's campfire or sometimes the smoke from two or three camps ; and she marveled again . It was so foolish not to put the fires out . It was as if these white men were mocking and challenging the Blackfeet by proclaiming their coming . Did Captain Long Knife and Captain Red Hair realize that there were hundreds , yes , thousands of Blackfoot warriors and that they were the most fierce fighters on earth ? They seemed not to . Did they not know that if their party was taken captive they wouldP170all be tortured in ways more fiendish than they had ever heard of ? All day long she cast anxious glances ahead , and all night she dreamed troubled dreams in which she and her child never reached her people at all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would look at the face of Lewis or Clark when she knew that they were unaware of her and she would wonder about them . Were they as brave as they seemed to be ? She was to decide again and again that they were . One late April morning just after breakfast Lewis was walking upriver with one of the men when suddenly they were face to face with two of the monstrousbears . They were the yellow or gray or white bears  --  the captainshardly knew what to call them but did not think of them as the grizzly . Lewis said to Drewyer , " Take the one nearest you . .. . Ready ? " Almost in the same instant the two men fired . What happenednext so astounded Lewis that he was never to forget it . The bear which Drewyer shot made a ferocious roaring but fled nevertheless ; the one Lewis shot threw its head up a moment , gave a challengethat shook the earth , and charged . The amazed captain took to his heels , trying to ram powder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to see if the monster was gaining . The bear had been mortally wounded , and so was not able to run at its top speed ; and after Lewis had gone about a hundred yards he turned and fired again , and a moment later Drewyer fired . The beast went down . The two men walked over to look at it . It was a male , hardly more than half-grown . Curiously Lewis examined it , observing that its talons and teeth were much larger and stronger than those of the bears he had known ; that its color was a yellowish-brown , its eyes black and small , and its fur thicker and finer than that of the black bear . He reflected that the Indians might fear this beast , armed as they were with only bows and arrows or poor guns ; but for him it was not a formidable adversary . " It seems about as easy to kill as any other species of bear , " he said to Drewyer . " I ca n't understand why the Indians are so afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he resumed his walk . He saw today a great many wolves and concluded that their number was always in proportion to the number of the beasts they stalked . They were craven things . They nearly always hunted in packs , and at this time of year , he had observed , their favorite prey was the pregnant does . But usually not on land : the cowards caughtp171them when they were swimming . His dog had plunged into the river and caught a swimming antelope and drowned it . Sometimes out on the plains the wolves lured a single beast away from the herd or caught one that had strayed off . Because it was fleeter than they the crafty killers tried to maneuver its flight in the form of a circle , so that a divided pack could take turns chasing it and resting . He was a cunning rascal , the wolf . The wiry Welsh blacksmith , John Shields , had got so filled up with rheumatic pains that he was no good for anything . A number of the men had large painful boils and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and May 2nd a wind was so violent that the men tossed in their sleep and the baby howled as though covered with mosquitoes and the dog howled ; and at daylight the next morning it began to snow and in two hours everything but the river was white . The next morning there was white frost on boats and trees and ice a quarter of an inch thick in the pails . As the men labored with the boats , waterfroze to their poles and oars . How extraordinary it was , Lewis thought , gazing round him , to see trees in leaf and flowers opening , yet snow an inch deep . Dark against the snow were the huge herds of elk and antelope and buffalo ; and everywhere were geese , ducks and swans . By May 4th the cold abated and the insatiably curious Lewis was off to see if three nights of frost had done any damage . Mr. Jefferson would wish to know about such things . The leaves of cottonwood , box elder and willow , it seemed to him , had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had turned ( lark and curled . Having tucked these facts away in his mind , to be entered in his Journal this evening for Mr. Jefferson , he went out to the prairie and passed close to the feeding herds . The buffalo bulls had so little interest in him that at a distance of fifty paces they would merely look up a moment and then go on feeding . He saw a number of the gray bears but they were too far away for a good shot : he did not like to wound creatures and let them go : both he and Clark had told their men that though hunting was a fine sport they were never to kill more than could be eaten and they were never to kill for the mere fun of it . If they wounded a beast they were always to do their best to bring it down . But bringing the gray bear down , the captains were to learn the next day , was just about as difficult as the red men had said it would be . Toward evening Clark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hugep173grizzled monster , on a sand beach ; and even while reaching for his gun and before he had got a good look at it he sensed that it was a more dreadful-looking thing than he had ever seen before . He called to Drewyer and the two men went after it . Firing and reloading as rapidly as they could , they shot the beast ten times and it still refused to go down . On the contrary , it set up a roaring that shook the world and then , plunging into the river , swam halfway across it and emerged on a sandbar . It walked around there and continued to roar with the most earth-shaking sounds Clark had ever heard . It gave him gooseflesh just to hear it . " The Almighty Lord , " he said in a tone of awe . " Just listen to it . " The bear , Drewyer said , was pretty mad and no doubt of it . " Ten times we fired . Ten times I thought I saw the fur part . " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he doing ? Digging a hole ? " The wounded bear usually dug a hole , Drewyer said . But it was only for a few moments that the beast seemed to be digging . Then again it was ambling around and roaring with such thunderous rage and pain that every man in the boats stood up and stared . Hearing the awful sound , Lewis had come in . He went up to Clark and said , " Why do n't you shoot it ? " " Captain , that bear has ten balls in him . " " And still wo n't die ? " asked the astonished Lewis . The hear refused to die for what Clark calculated to be ten minutes . Then the roaring fell to a kind of whine , to a kind of sad moaning , and at last ceased . The monster was still . The captains and all their men went to the sandbar and for a few minutes were content merely to stand and look . Clark was to say in his Journal that the beast was tremendous . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when after skinning it they discovered that five of the balls had gone through the beast 's lungs , two through its guts , one through its neck and two through its lower shoulders . Carefully the captains measured it and proclaimed their findings . " Eight feet seven and a half inches from the nose to the hind feet . . .. Five feet ten and a half inches around at the breast . . . . One foot eleven inches around the middle of the arm .... Three feet eleven inches around the neck . . . . Five talons on each foot each four and three-eighths inches long .... " They judged that his mawp173was ten times the size of the black bear 's . They found it filled with flesh and fish . How did he catch fish ? the men wondered . The beast was cut up in chunks small enough to be put into the kettles . The cooks rendered the oil out of the meat and stored it in a cask for future use . The captains had learned that the fat of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent flavor . Around the campfires this evening the men had little to say . Formerlysome of them had been boastful ; they had been yearning to meet the monster which Captain Clark now called a grizzly bear . But now they were remembering that two of the best shots in the party had put ten bullets into it . They had been deafened by its hideous roars . They had seen it swim halfway across a wide river . For almost half an hour they had watched it on the sandbar , a mon- ster with ten wounds in it , six or seven of which would have been enough to drop a black bear or a buffalo in its tracks . What kind of creature was this ! What man among them would dare to stand up to it ? Little wonder that before the red men went forth to attack it they put on their war paint and propitiated their manitous , just as they did before riding away to war . " Well , this is what I think , " said Reuben Fields to his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you 've got to shoot it through the brain or the heart . " " If you can , " said Joe . " You looked at its head ? Just go over to the sandbar and look at its head . It 's inches deep with tough muscle and thick bone . " " Then through the heart , " Reuben said . " Oh yes , if you can . But what if you miss it ? " Bill Bratton was saying to Bob Frazier , " Would you tackle one alone ? " " Me ? Not unless I was crazy . " " I would , " Bill said . " I will the first chance I get . " George Shannon and John Colter were listening . George looked at Bill . He bunched his apple-cheeks up and banked the lids against his gentle blue eyes . " The first chance you get , " George said . " I expect you 're praying that it will be a small one . " " As big as they come , " Bill said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He 's full of brag , " Bob Frazier said.  |p174Ca|ptain  Lewis had been walking among the men . He overheard Shannon 's remark and came up . " Watching what , Private Shannon ? " " Bill Bratton , sir . He 's going to tackle the biggest grizzly bear and shoot him through the heart . " Lewis turned to Bill . " You know where his heart is ? " " Yes , sir . I studied that one when they skinned it . " " I suppose you know that this is the mating season and a male bear just does n't like to be disturbed when he 's making love . " George Shannon said , " Sir , no man does . " Lewis grinned . This George youngster had a quick wit . A few days later these six men in two dugouts had fallen half a mile behind the main party and were rowing hard to catch up when they saw a huge grizzly bear lying out in the open , sunning himself . " Look , " George Shannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Holy grandma ! " Bill said . " He 's the biggest one yet . " " Can you tell where his heart is ? " " I expect we 'd better all do this job , " Joe Fields said . " Bill can be brave some other time . " They rowed the canoes to a bank and softly beached them . BecauseFrazier was the oldest of the six the other five let him act as the leader . The men were now whispering . Frazier said , " I recommendfour of us shoot him and two hold their fire . " " Who holds ? " asked Joe Fields . Frazier looked at the men . Still whispering he said , " Joe and John , they 're the best shots . Bill wants to shoot , I can see , so he 's one of the four . Besides , he 'll shoot it through the heart . George and me , we 'll hold . Now look , we want to get just as close as we can . How far out is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Or more , " said Bill . " The wind is that way , " said Bob , looking west . " We 'll go the other way . See the ridge over there . I think we can crawl up till we 're right on top of him . " " Then you 'll fence with him , " George said . " Then we 'll watch Bill shoot him through the heart . Your guns all in order ? " The men all examined their guns . They then turned to the east , bent over , rifles across their arms ; and after going up the river a hundred yards they turned into the wind and headed for the ridge.  |p175The  bear was beyond them , over the hill . When they were about halfway up the ridge Bob Frazier , leading , dropped to hands and knees . The men behind him followed suit and they all crept along , as noiseless as the wolf . Now and then Bob would rise a little to peer . At last , after peering over the hilltop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a whisper he said , " He 's still there . Not more than a hundred and fifty feet . " Whispering , Joe said , " Lying down ? " " Yes . He does n't know we 're here . " Again the men examined their guns . They were not trembling but they were tense and their breathing was labored . Five of them were not yet twenty-one , two were not yet nineteen : they were picked men , every one of them , but they had n't forgotten the grizzly on the sandbar . Bob rolled back behind the others and George rolled with him . The other four were side by side , on their knees and crouched down , their guns ready . They were waiting for the signal . Bob moved forward to whisper , " When you stand up do n't be in a hurry to shoot . I do n't think he 'll see you , so take your time and fire when I give the word . " All six men stood up . Frazier was watching the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all had their rifles up and seemed poised and ready he said , " Four seconds now . . . . Fire . " An instant later four guns blazed and the great beast came to his feet with a terrible roar . Lifting his head , he saw the men and roared again , and the men saw the red spumes of his blood . Bob and George had advanced a little and now they both fired . " You both hit him , " Joe Fields said , busy reloading . That meant six balls in the monster but he was charging now and he came with amazing speed . He came so fast that the six men took to their heels and ran like the wind for the river , never once pausing to look back . They could hear him snorting blood , they could hear the great soft bounce of him . It was two hundred yards to the river : never in their lives had any of them run so fast or moved so swiftly when they reached the bank . Frazier and Shannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the river . The other four had dived into a thicket of willow and rose bramble , trying to reload as they ran . Baffled and frustrated , the monster stood for a moment looking at the two men out in the canoe . He stood so long , his small dull mindp176trying to determine what to do , that the men in the thicket had time to reload and creep forward . All four of them shot him again . The beast swung and rushed for the thicket and the men there were flushed out like deer from a covert . The four of them separated in pairs , the Fields brothers going together . Still snorting blood and roaring with pain and rage the bear took after the Fields brothers and gained on them so swiftly that they threw away both guns and pouches and from a bank twenty feet high plunged headfirst to the river . The bear was so close to Reuben that he was reaching to seize him when Reuben jumped . Without a moment 's hesitation the bear jumped after him and almost landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that engulfed Reuben and took him under . The two men in the canoe had reloaded and were maneuvering to get a shot at the beast but they were afraid to fire lest they hit one of the Fields brothers . Those brothers with all the desperate power they had were trying to swim upstream against the current and the hear was swimming after them . Another monster with ten bullets in him ! Reuben thought , and wondered whether to strike across the wide river . What were the other men doing ? Why did n't they fire ? John Colter was ready to . Sprawled on his belly on the bank above , he was trying to fix his sight on the beast 's head . There was such furious splashing of water by both men and bear that most of the time he was unable to tell where the furred head was ; but at last he got his sight on it and fired . With a gurgling roar the great monster rolled over and over in the swift current and the Fields brothers , turning , went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to help . Reuben and Joe seized talons on a huge paw and towed the dying beast downstream , until they were past the high bank . The six men then beached him and stood looking at him . They were all breathing hard . They were all pale . Frazier spoke first . " I do n't know what we 'd a-done if Bill had n't shot him through the heart . " " Holy grandma , " Bill said . " You still ready to tackle one alone ? " " Sure . This one was n't turned right . " " Oh , you mean you 're going to walk up and turn him around ? " Reuben was examining the leather trousers at the back of his lowerlegs . " I thought he struck me , " he said . " I thought I felt his claws . " Probing with his finger , Frazier was locating the bullet hole in thep177skull . " It was a mighty fine shot , " he said to John Colter . " I think you hit his brains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin him out . The captains will want the pelt and the lard . " " We 'd better get our guns first , " Reuben said . The captains at almost the same time were having troubles of their own . They had both left the pirogues to walk up the bank , a thing they rarely did , for they had agreed that one of them should always he with the party . They had also , contrary to their best judgment , allowed Charbonneau to steer the white pirogue , instead of Drewyer , whose task it was . To this pirogue they still entrusted all their papers and maps , instruments , medicines , as well as a considerable part of their most valuable merchandise . As formerly , when the squawman almost capsized it , the pirogue was under sail and was moving nicely when a sudden blast of wind turned it broadside to the current . The river was rough , the waves were high . As formerly , Charbonneau yielded to panic and did the wrong thing  --  and at exactly that moment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of putting the boat before the wind he swung into it . Another gust tore the squaresail from the grasp of the man holding it and the pirogue upset and would have turned completelyover but for the fact that the sail canvas acted as a brake against the water . The two captains went stiff with amazement . " O my God ! " said Lewis . " Look at that damned fool ! " With a wild impulsive movement he fired his gun . Clark then fired his gun and both captains began to shout like men out of their minds . Yelling into the wind , they told the boat crew to haul the sails in but nobody heard them . All but two of those in the boat were so filled with fright and consternation that they had no idea of what they were doing. " 0 my God ! " cried Lewis . " It will turn topsaturva ! " He began to act like a man demented . He threw down his gun . Ile hurled his shot pouch aside . He had the thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred yards to save the instruments and the medicines . He was unbuttoning his jacket and still yelling furiously when a realization of his folly struck him : the waves were so high they were curling in white water , the water was cold , the distance was nearly a thousand feet and , worst of all , he was a poor swimmer . He would drown . Still , he 'd rather be deadp178than turn back , now that they had come twenty-two hundred miles from St. Louis and were deep in the unknown . " O my God ! " he said , eyes staring , hands fumbling to rebutton his jacket . The captains could not see clearly what was taking place on the pirogue . They could not hear the frightened and half-paralyzed Charbonneau begging his God for mercy . They did not see Cruzatte seize a gun and threaten to blow the squawman 's head off if he did not at once take the rudder and do what he was ordered to do . Cruzatte had two men bailing water . He and two other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while had been recovering many of the articles that had been thrown out when the boat turned : from end to end of the pirogue she had dashed and reached out for one floating thing and another , paying no attention to the men and the confusion . .. . Having shouted themselves hoarse , the captains could only stare and wait . " That fool ! " Lewis muttered . " That damned clumsy fool . " " I think they 'll make it to land , " Clark said . The captains entered their canoe and crossed the river . Hastening to the pirogue , which the men and the girl were now unloading , they saw that everything in it had got soaked , except the powder , which was sealed in lead canisters . All the papers and maps were wet . These the captains took gently from clumsy hands and laid out on grass where a breeze could strike them . How much of the merchandisehad been lost ? Not much of it , Cruzatte said . The squaw had rushed back and forth along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the things and had then brooded over them like a great hen , to keep them secure . Clark looked over at her , where with her own garments and her hair she was trying to wipe instruments dry . He went over and looked down at the articles she had laid out . " Jawey , you are a fine woman , " he said . She made a birdlike movement downward , that was both acknowledgmentand curtsy , and went on working . But for her , Clark was thinking , our journey would be over  --  but for this girl who , indifferent to danger , even danger to her son , recovered those things which she knew we must have . He wanted to reward her but could think of no suitable way . . . . After all the men had come in and the six had told of their closep179encounter with the grizzled monster , the captains decided to give each man a half-cup of ardent spirits , to cheer and comfort him . Lewis told the squawman that after this he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another serving of that pudding boudin blanc , of which the men seemed to be mighty fond ? In his Journal he had written : .... this white pudding we all esteem one of the greatest delacies of the forrest , it may not be amiss therefore to give it a place . About 6 feet of the lower extremity of the large gut of a Buffaloe is the first mosel that the cook makes love to , this he holds fast at one end with the right hand , while with the forefinger and thumb of the left he gently compresses it , and dischargeswhat he says is not good to eat but of which in the squel we get a moderate portion ; the mustle lying underneath the shoulder blade next to the back , and fillets are nest saught , these are needed up very fine with a good portion of kidney suit ; to this composition is then added a jist proportion of pepper and salt and a small quantity of flour ; thus far advanced , our skilfull opporater C -- o seizes his recepticle , which has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regular order of the whole procedure ; you will not forget that the side you now see is that covered with a good coat of fat provided the anamal be in good order ; the operator seizes the recepticle I say , and tying it fast at one end turns it inward and begins now with repeated evolutions of the hand and arm , and a brisk motion of the finger and thumb to put in what he says is bon pour manger ; thus by stuffing and compressing he soon distends the recepticle to the utmost limmits of it 's power of expansion , and in the course of its longtudinal progress it drives from the other end of the recepticle a much larger portion of thethan was prevously discharged by the finger and thumb of the left hand in a former part of the operation ; thus when the sides of the recepticle are skilfully exchanged the outer for the iner , and all is compleatly filled with something good to eat , it is tyed at the other end , but not any cut off , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then baptised in the missouri with two dips and a flirt , and bobbed into the kettle ; from whence , after it be well boiled it is taken and fryed with bears oil until it becomesbrown , when it is ready to esswage the pangs of a keenp180appetite or such as travelers in the wilderness are seldom at a loss for . The men all liked Charbonneau 's meat dish but of their other foods they agreed on little . Lewis was fond of marrowbones , beaver tail and of liver from any beast . Some of the men did not like liver at all and a few of them thought that beaver flesh when boiled had a sickening odor . Practically all of them liked marrowbone fat , fat buffalohump and venison but not all of them liked buffalo tongue , which among Indians was a supreme delicacy . Some of them liked the meal of sunflower seeds made into bread ; some liked it to thicken beef broth ; but Shannon preferred simply to stir it in water and drink it , and Gass liked it best mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiled meat morning , noon and night and suffered from boils and abscesses . But not the girl . Clark had seen her a number of times eating berries that still hung on twigs , or roots , bark , cress , moss , or even last year 's leaves . Her people , she said , lived chiefly on fruits , roots , tree bark and fish . Though they had many horses they lived in such deadly fear of the Blackfeet that they remained mountainbound , venturing east to the buffalo plains only once in a long while . After supper the captains sat by their campfire , and Lewis as usual took delight in sniffing the fragrance of burning sage , willow or cottonwood . Soon , he said , they should be able to see the Rocky Mountains . Clark had Sacajawea sent over and again asked where her people were . Again she looked into the west and said , " There . " " How far ? " As before , she counted on her fingers , adding up the sleeps . Ten more sleeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For one thing , she had been only a small child when she was stolen and taken away . For another thing , the red people found it fascinating to count on their fingers and often did not pause until they had counted off all of them . When the total was ten , Clark told himself , it would be twenty if they had that many fingers . " Ten sleeps , she says , but how far is that ? With horses it might be three hundred miles . You say your people live beyond the Rockies , yet we ca n't even see them yet . " He turned to Lewis . " This western land is bigger than I thought it was . " " It 's tall country , " Lewis said.  | " Tall and broad . " There were so many questions they wished to ask the girl but she had neither the language for reply nor the knowledge . They wanted to know if anywhere near her people there was a river that flowed west into the ocean . Her people must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If there was no river , would they be able to buy horses for a long portage ? They had asked her this question and she had said no . If there was no river and they could buy no horses what would they do ? As for the girl , she now seemed confused in regard to her people but she recalled vividly her capture and her long journeyeast ; her astonishment at the abundance of food in the lodges of her captors , their handsome houses , their weapons and garments and bedding . Such luxuries her people had never known . Only the other day she had again warned the captains that they were close to Blackfoot land . She had pointed to the fire , with its great room of light in the darkness ; and to the north and the northwest . With the help of her man the captains had got this story from her . Before she was born her people , literally starving to death , had persuaded two or three other tribes to join them in a foray into buffaloland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it was the biggest hunting-party ever to come out of Snakeland . They pushed ahead as far as the Great Falls on the Missouri and , finding plenty of fat buffalo there , were feasting as they had not feasted in years . The women were drying huge piles of flesh to take home and were dressing skins ; the older children were catching fish in the river . They were all happy . Then the enemy came . They saw two hundred Blackfoot warriors coming afoot and the leaders of her own people laughed . Did they think to oppose four hundred warriors with half that number ?  --  and without horses ! " We will go to meet them , " the Snake leaders said . " We will go on horses and we will kill them all . " And so the Snake warriors , all mounted , set out , the chiefs saying , " Do n't let loose your arrows until you can see their eyes . " Then suddenly the whole world went wild . Thunder fell from the heavens , lightning broke in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but it was chiefly Snake warriors falling from their horses . Her people 's warriors fell by the score but not a Blackfoot warrior was touched by arrow or lance . It was an awful day . The weapons of the enemy , they were the weapons of the skygodsthat gutted trees and broke the rocks of the mountains andp182knocked men from their horses as easily as knocking an ant from your hand . With the plains covered with dead and wounded Snake warriors , her people who were able had fled back to their own barren home , where the buffalo came never , and rarely the elk and bighorn ... . The captains realized that for her people the terror had grown with repeated telling . The Blackfeet could not be that deadly , even with the white man 's weapons . Still , they had thought that the grizzledmonster was nothing to worry about , yet over there by a fire sat six bold young men whom one bear had put to flight . They did n't look so bold now . They looked quite abashed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them had met his eyes . He had never seen young men more chastened . Well , he reflected , the Blackfeet might be as formidable as the Indians said they were but it would get a white man nothing to worry about them . It was time again for sleep and he was tired . He went to the skin-tent and , lifting the mosquito netting , let himself inside.  |p183They  were all tired , every one of them , including the squawman . The farther up the Missouri they went the swifter they found the water , the higher the waves , the steeper or rockier the banks ; and the men rowing or towing the boats became so numbed with fatigue that it was an ordeal when morning came to leave their beds . All those who rowed , poled or towed had cut and swollen feet and torn toenails . Most of the men of the party had boils . William Bratton had such a huge boil on one hand that he was not good for much , and so one morning Lewis told him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might ease his pain . In a few moments Bratton was out of sight . An hour later one of the men heard an unearthly cry and said , " Listen ! " They all listened . They stared at one another , wondering what this sound could be . It came again and again , a kind of agonized shriek or scream torn from a creature mad with fear or pain . It kept coming , and the men gazed up the river but could see no living thing . They had not yet related the sound to the human voice , and did not until about a half a mile distant there suddenly burst from a grove of trees what unmistakably was a man running at full speed . Ile was running with such speed that he seemed now and then to leave the earth in immense leaps , and touch , only to soar again . " God in heaven ! " said Shannon . " It 's Bill . " " It 's more than Bill , " Bob Frazier said . " Look what 's at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next drink that Bill shot it right through the heart . " " God in heaven , " said Shannon , " look at them come ! " P184The thing at Bill Bratton 's heels was a monstrous grizzly . Too fascinated to think of going to the rescue , the men stared and exclaimed . Then , abruptly , the bear gave up the chase and turned and vanished . Apparently Bill did not know that his foe had abandoned him , for he still came at phenomenal speed , flinging his hands as though trying to make wings of them , and screaming with all the power of his voice . Not once did he glance back or break off his infernalsound of terror . A pirogue had been put to a bank to receive him and he hit it with such force that Lewis thought he must have broken his neck . He came in headlong , as if shot from a cannon , and for what Lewis afterward judged to be fifteen minutes he was unable to utter a word . His heart beat so loud that every person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , white and utterly spent , his breath rasping in his throat and choking him . Lewis stood above him , looking down . He hoped that the big boastful lubber had ruptured the boil in his flight , for then he would not have to lance it , but he saw that the boil looked larger than ever . When Bratton was able to talk he gasped out this story . He had walked a mile or more up the river and unexpectedly had confronted the largest grizzly he had ever seen . He had time to fire only once . After that it was a race for his life . He gasped the story out , wheezing , sucking air in , choking , moaning . " You forgot to turn him around , " Frazier said . " I expect you shot it through the heart , " George Shannon said . " Of course you did , William . " " Shut up ! " Bill cried , wheezing . He had put forth such abnormal exertion that he had ruptured blood vessels in his forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best hunters Lewis went up the river . After half a mile they easily followed the beast by its bloody trail and after another half a mile they found it in a thicket , digging itself a hole and licking its wound . They shot it twice in the head and then skinned and examined it . Bratton had shot it in its heartchamberand it had bled a great deal inside but had seemed to be as strong as ever . It was such an enormous thing that it took two of the strongest men just to carry its hide . From its fat the party took eight gallons of oil . That evening the captains gave an order : after this , no man was to leave camp alone . They also admonished their men to use more care against rattlesnakes , for these venomous creatures were now to be found in every weed patch and behind every stone . One of theP185men , lying in camp , had sleepily reached up to a willow limb above him and closed his hand on a rattler 's head . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , saying , " You wo n't think it a joke if you fall down in convulsions and begin to pray . " Lewis was standingone day when , hearing rattles , he looked down and saw one of the pests upright between his legs , its head ready to strike . With his espontoon , a steel-shod pike , he had killed it . This one and others he had measured and examined : they were about three feet in length and were of yellowish-brown color on their backs and sides , with rows of oval brown spots . If it was n't grizzlies or rattlesnakes , Lewis said , it was something else , for danger was now their constant companion . One night in camp the sergeant of the guard let off a fearful yell . On looking out of their skin-tent the captains saw that a huge cottonwood tree , not far from where they stood and leaning toward them , was afire in its entire upper length . Quickly they moved their tent and a moment afterward two or three tons of flaming wood crashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeping . To Clark , Lewis said , " By just ten minutes we missed being smashed to atoms . " " If the Blackfeet do n't get us , " Clark said , " something else will . " The thing that seemed most likely to get them along this stretch of the Missouri was the grizzled monster . One day ashore with two of the men Clark met one and shot it . The beast ran at what seemed full speed for a quarter of a mile before it fell . On examining it Clark was amazed to learn that the bullet had gone right through the heart . Ile stood silent , looking at the monster . He would never have believedthat any creature could run four or five hundred yards after a large ball had torn through its heart-chambers . Where in all of creationwas there a more formidable adversary than this ! Back in camp he told Lewis that a grizzly had run a good quarter of a mile shot through the heart but at the moment Lewis was too concerned to listen . His dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the hunters had wounded and the beaver had sunk his long sharp chisels through the dog 's throat . Now the dog was bleeding to death . He had labored over him all afternoon , Lewis said . Ile was to labor over him all night . Desperately he searched through the list of medicines for something that would stanch the flow of blood . Now and then some of the men would come over to Lewis andp186the dog to learn if the beast was getting better or worse . Lewis did n't know . All dogs in pain , he said , were mute and patient : they would look at you with their eloquent suffering eyes and hope that you could do something . Because they endured without a whimper you never could tell how close to death they were . The blood had stopped flowing from the wound but the dog was too weak to stand . During the night some of the men left their beds and came ; and even after midnight , even after three in the morning . The emotional and impulsiveLewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the beast lying comfortably in a pirogue , the party moved upstream ; and that evening the hunters reported that about five miles up the Mussel Shell River there was a handsome stream a hundred and fifty feet wide . Lewis proposed that it should be named for Sacajawea : her concern over the suffering dog had momentarily endeared her to him . Besides , he had observed Clark 's tendency to name rivers for women . He suspected that they were for girls whom Clark had once loved or still loved but the captains never spoke to one another about love and women . Though danger was present every day the captains never turned aside from their principal task , that of discovering new and fascinatingthings . Their sharp eyes missed little . For a week now they had been curious about a mountain animal with huge horns . Clark called it an ibex . Lewis did not think it was the ibex . Some of the men thought it was a species of goat . One day Drewyer shot one and brought its head and horns to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The head and horns , Clark said , were monstrously out of proportion to the remainder of the beast . Moreover , between male and femalethere was a much greater disparity in size than among deer or goats . " I had noticed that , " Lewis said . " Their head , nostrils and the split in the upper lip are like the sheep and their legs resemble the sheep 's . Like the sheep , they stand forward in the knee . " " Then you do n't think it is an ibex . What is an ibex , anyway ? " " A goat with recurved horns , " said Clark , who was busy writing a long description of the big-horned animal . The next day , hoping to get a close view of the ibex-sheep , Lewis climbed to an eminence and looked into the west . He felt a thrill go clear through him . He rubbed at his eyes and looked again . No ,  |p187this  was not an illusion , not a mirage : there they were : he was gazing upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His breathing almost stopped . Yes , good Lord , there they were , white with snow and shining in a full sun ! He felt deep pleasure at finding himself so near at last to the headwaters of the Missouri ; so near , he dared hope , to his ultimate goal . But then , coming to himself , as captain of a Corps and not a romantic dreamer , he realized that this high snowcapped range might be impassable . He had a vision of indescribablesufferings and hardships  --  of his party marooned in the frozen summits , snowbound and without food ; and of its defeat and slow death . But then he chided himself . He told himself ( what this evening he was to enter in his Journal ) that it was a crime to anticipateevils : he would believe that there was a wide comfortable road across those high cold mountains , until overwhelming misfortunecompelled him to believe that there was not ! And so , his gaze lingering , he turned away , with the wonder of it all like a great sensuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the north . The captains now knew that Indians were on the river upstream , or recently had been . Were the Blackfeet watching them ? They did not , he supposed , remembering the slave-girl 's anxieties and fears , worry enough about this ferocious nation . Well , they had many other things to worry about . He and Clark had been asleep in their tent one night when all hell seemed to break loose in their camp . A huge buffalo bull had swum over from the opposite bank and because he was dimwitted and dimsighted , with great shaggy forelocks hanging over his eyes , he had climbed up and over the white pirogue , making an infernal clatter ; and then had gone loping straight toward the fires , the sharp chisels of his hooves striking within eighteen inches of the heads of sleeping men . A guard had turned him and , wild with fright , he had gone plunging past other sleepers , his deadly feet striking within three or four inches of the brains of men . Again he had veered and headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded dog had gone mad with rage and had attacked so savagely that the monster changed direction still again and soon was out of camp and out of sight . All the men by this time were in an uproar : they had seized their guns and knives and were shouting at one another , demanding to know who was attacking . Was it the Blackfeet ? The next morning it was learned that the rifle belonging to York had been stepped on by the bull and the barrel was now bent in the shape of a quarterp188moon . In the white pirogue a number of things had been broken or scattered . Looking at the damage , Lewis observed with dry mirth that this boat seemed to be attended by evil genii . But the threat of danger , the captains decided , was good for their men . Now that they were in swifter waters and between the upper river 's higher banks , those with the boats suffered terribly with torn and swollen feet . But instead of complaining they looked out on life for things that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big Negro . They had forgotten their resentment because of his triumphswith the squaws . They all admitted , at least privately , that he was all man , this big giant , for he never tried to shirk ; and though his feet were no tougher than white feet , and his many wounds just as painful , day after day he did the work of two men . With forked sticks they pinned rattlesnakes to the earth at their necks and then lay prone to study their flicking tongues and cold eyes . They chased wolves and brained the creatures with one blow across their skulls ; or while one threw a net over the beast 's face another would seize his tail and swing him round and round , at last letting him spill on his head and roll head over heels . The wolf they hated because of the antelope 's innocence . This beast , fleetest by far of all those on the plains , seemed to have the curiosity of both the magpie and the cat . A hunter had only to go into deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or lie on his back and thrust a foot up and the foolish antelope would race round and round it in a steadily narrowing circle , until it was easy to shoot it through the head or neck . This trick the men had learned from the wolf . The wolf would lose himself in deep grass and put a paw up and waggle it or in some other way arouse the antelope 's curiosity ; and it would begin to race round and round , all the while closing the circle and at last actually coming so close that the wolf could spring and seize it . The men said they had never heard of a beast so stupid . York said the coon was just as curious . A dozen of the men looked for a few moments at the Negro , wondering about his knowledge of things . Though a slave he was trying to be one of them , and some of the men were willing to accept him as an equal , now that all the women but one were far away and York , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat and sleep and work . Another said the heaver was just as dumb . This busy creature , finding itself in a large grove of cottonwood and willow , the barksp189of which were its favorite food , was not content to fell only enough trees for its stomach and its dams , but with sleepless energy brought down every tree it could find . Then , having devastated an area , destroyedits food supply and made a shambles of its engineering projects , it had to explore up- or downstream for another site . The beaver or the antelope , George Shannon said , you could take your choice . It was a wonder how either survived . The day after the buffalo bull plunged through the camp the party came to another tributary and Clark promptly named it Judith 's River . He thought Judith was the name of the girl he hoped to marry on his return , having been too busy as a soldier , with so little time for romantic fancies , to have learned that her name was not Judith but Julia . Lewis walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire-ashes of a hundred and twenty-six Indian lodges . He thought the fires were about twelve or fifteen days old . Looking round him , he found a couple of worn-out moccasins and these he took to Sacajawea . She turned them over and over in her small brown hands , studying the leather and the sewing . Looking up at Lewis , she shook her head no and then spoke to her man . Charbonneausaid she thought they belonged to Indians who lived east of the Rockies and north of the Missouri . Perhaps the Blackfeet . It was not the sewing of her people . Were a hundred and twenty-six lodges of Blackfeet up the river from them ? The captains asked the question again when they came to an astonishingsight : a great herd of buffalo  --  Lewis estimated the numherat several hundred  --  had been stampeded and driven over a precipice with a sheer drop of more than a hundred feet . The stench was overpowering . The scattered mangled carcasses , all of them torn open by wolves and bears , were the most hideous sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of wolves and they seemed , Lewis thought , extremely fat and gentle . Clark at the moment was on the opposite bank . Lewis sent a canoe to fetch him . " Captain Clark , " he said , after Clark had joined him , " I saw you observing this immense number of carcasses . Is n't it the Blackfeet who stampede whole herds over precipices ? " " I 've heard that they do . " " Do the Minnetarees ? "  | " I do n't know . You think the camp on Judith 's River was Black-feet ? " " Were we told last winter that the Big Bellies drive whole herds over precipices and leave most of the flesh to rot ? I do n't remember it . " Clark was looking round him for Indian sign . " I expect , " he said , " we 're in Blackfoot country all right . " " I expect , " said Lewis , " that maybe they 're looking at us right now . " The next day and the next they found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl look at them . They were not her people , she said . Her people had never come this far from home . She thought they were not the Minnetarees ; for years she had lived close to them and they did not set up their lodges in this kind of pattern . Besides , they were a small nation : how could so many of them be so far away from home so early ? " That 's a good question , " Clark said . " I was thinking the same thing . If a large band had come up the river ahead of us we 'd have known it . If so many had been away all last winter we 'd have known it . " " It must be the Blackfeet , " Clark said . " Are there any Big Bellies on the Saskatchewan ? " " We 've never heard of any . " " The squaw thinks they 're the Blackfeet . " " I do n't see who else it could be . " " They know we 're here , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days probably . They are going on up the river ahead of us and they surely have some plan in mind . " " I would assume so , " Clark said . Sacajawea was frightened , for she had no doubt that these were Blackfoot warriors . Even more , she was astonished . The captains and their men , without turning a hair , went right on up the river and every night they made their big fires and made their music and danced . She had never heard of such boldness . The Blackfeet were up the river ahead of them , because for days now their fire-ashes had been found along the banks . And day by day the signs had becomefresher . Did the captains realize that this might be a huge warpartythat was going up and up the river ahead of them only to lead them into an ambush , in some narrow canyon where they could fire from behind rocks ?  |p191Her  astonishment grew at the incredible boldness of these men . They made their fires just as big as ever and seemed not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made their musicand danced , and even shouted , appearing not to care at all if a thousand fierce warriors were looking at them from the darkness . She could n't understand it . She thought them ignorant , for she could not believe that any men were so brave . Furtively she studied the face of Chief Long Knife , of Chief Red Hair  --  but she might as well have looked at the turbid Missouri waters . The captains were calmly writingin their journals ; or while one labored over a map by firelight the other sucked at his pipe . It was true that all night men stood watch but she wished she could leave the skin-tent in which she slept and stand watch herself . That the Blackfeet would strike some morning with overwhelming force she did not doubt at all . She infected her man with her anxieties and he spoke to Lewis . Ile said they would be attacked and they would all be massacred . " Maybe , " Lewis said . " Maybe . But the surest way to get the red man after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . Let them come . " During the hours of light Sacajawea did watch , all day long . Time and again she slipped away , her child standing up her back , to climb a tree or a hill and look far up the river . She searched the Indian encampments for some proof that these were Blackfeet , though she had no idea what the proof could be . At last , feeling that the entire party would be destroyed if she did not act , she took her man away and out of sight . She begged him to speak again to the captains . She told him again what terrible warriors the Blackfeet were and with what triumphant shrieks they tortured their captives . Some morning five hundred or a thousand of them  --  she indicated the numbers by the leaves on trees  --  would dash in and some of them would die and some of them would be taken away to the torture-places . Her man told her that the white chiefs said they were not afraid . They had powerful medicine . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warn them ! " she begged him in French . " Warn them ! " He shrugged . He was scared but he had to pretend to be as brave as any man here . He had also been pretending that he was a mighty hunter , and two days later when he saw Drewyer , the best shot of them all , take his gun and set off he asked to go along . Drewyer , a man of few words , said neither yes nor no , and so the squawmanp192went with him . The Bear of the Forest , Drewyer was thinking . The Bear of the Forest . That 's what the Mandans called him . An hour later they jumped a big grizzly and for a few moments Drewyer tried to get a bead on its head . Unable to , he shot it through its chest , aiming for its heart . At once the monster swung and charged . With a shout of warning to the squawman Drewyer took to his heels , trying to reload as he ran . He was not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rheumatism : his speed was too slow , the beast steadily gained on him and was soon almost close enough to seize him with jaws so powerful that they could crush a buffalo calf . Drewyer was despairing of his life , for there was no tree in sight , no river , no stone ledge , when on a most unaccountable impulsethe monster turned and charged the squawman . With a shriek that was heard by men two miles away he aimed his gun straight at the sky and fired it . Drewyer saw him do it . He saw the fool just poke his gun up at the sky and pull the trigger , then throw it away with another horrible yell and plunge headlong into a dense thicket of rose brambles . In that thicket Charbonneau with frenzied power rushed away on hands and knees , deeper and deeper into the mess of briars ; and the bear , seeing that his foe had vanished , swung and headed for Drewyer . Drewyer had had time to reload . He was determined not to shoot again into the chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tiny brain were wasted . And so he waited , as cool as a man could be , as the beast rushed him . There was such a deep ridge of frontal bone and muscle on the grizzly that a bullet straight into the forehead was a bullet thrown away . It had to be a little to one side or from the top down . A man had to hit an area no larger than a dollar on a bear in fast motion but this man was the best shot in the Corps and there was none cooler ; and a few moments later he stood looking at the dead monster at his feet . He called to the squawman and he came crawling to the edge of the thicket , his face covered with blood , for he had gouged and torn his flesh in his panic . For a few minutes Charbonneau remained there on hands and knees , looking over . Drewyer told Lewis of the incident  --  told him in only a few words ; and in only a few words Lewis recorded it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a shot in the head ; the shot indeed that will conquer the farocity of those tremendious anamals . " Then , before completing the day 's entry , he filled his pipe and sat a little while thinking of the man whose name the captains spelled as Drewyer but whose namep193was Drouillard : it had been a lucky day for the Corps when this man was chosen , for he killed twice the game of anyone else with half the fuss . If I were to go on a really dangerous journey , Lewis was thinking ( as though he were not on a really dangerous journey now ) , and were to choose of all the men I know only three or four to go with me , Drewyer would surely be one of them , even if he is a Frenchman .... He dipped his pen in ink and wrote again.  |p194On  the 3rd of June , fifty-six days and nearly a thousand miles from Fort Mandan , the captains knew that they were lost . Deep in this unknown land where no white man had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred miles to the west , they were at the junction of two great rivers ; but which was the Missouri and which was its affluent ? A wrong choice , the captains realized , could be disastrous . It had been wearisome and often dangerous toil for the boatmen the past six hundred miles , struggling barefooted over the sharp and slippery stones , often in water to their armpits , always in water so cold that it chilled them ; and now none of them could stand without pain or walk without limping . In his Journal , Lewis had written , ... it is with great pain that they do either . for some days past they were unable to wear their mockersons . . . they have fallen off considerably , but notwithstanding the difficulties past , or those which seem now to menace us , they still remain perfectly cheerful . " They were , the captains agreed , remarkable men but they were men who could stand so much and no more . They were men with feet scarred and calloused ; men who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten or twelve hours a day ; yet men not one of whom had ever whimpered or given any but a cheerful response when asked how he was . They were men who could reach the last extremity of endurance and blow up in mutinous rage if the captainswere to choose the wrong river and punish them with needless miles . How easy it would be for them to say they had had enough and to seize the pirogues and go back home !  |p195One  of the rivers came out of the northwest , the other out of the southwest . One of them , the Mandan Indians had said , had its headwatersclose to the Columbia . But which one ? Hoping to find an answer , the captains climbed a hill overlooking the junction . While climbing the hill Lewis was thinking , Two months of our traveling soason have already gone : if we mistake the river and ascend the wrong one , and then have to return and take the other , we 'll probably have to accept defeat and turn back . . . . Clark had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the summitand then looked at the vast level countryside around them , black in spots with its herds of buffalo , with here and there a pack of wolves , a herd of elk or the solitary mother antelope and her child . Far in the south they saw a lofty range , a part of it snowcapped . They could mark the courses of the two rivers only a short distance , and so could not be sure of their direction . They descended and took the width of the rivers , finding that the one on the south was over eleven hundred feet wide , the one on the north about six hundred . The north river was deeper but not so swift ; its waters had the whitish-brown color of the Missouri . The south river was as transparentas glass , its bottom covered with round pebbles like those to he found in any stream that came down from mountains . Lewis said , " I asked our riverman Cruzatte , which is the main river ? He says the north one . " " Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But the north one would color the whole Missouri . " " They do n't seem to realize that . " " If the south one clarified the Missouri they 'd think it the main stream . What does the squaw say ? " " She 's as lost as we are . " " She does n't know which way her people are from us ? " " An Indian , " Clark said , " has only four directions . " The captains decided to send a small exploring party up each river . They chose Gass to lead two men up the south river , Pryor to lead two men up the north river ; and they sent still other parties out to look for an eminence from which they could gaze far into the southwest , west and northwest . When those exploring the rivers came back with sketchy and wholly unsatisfactory reports the captainsknew that they would have to go and see for themselves . Lewis chose six men , with Drewyer among them ; Clark chose five , includ/feet would allow them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of days to push up these rivers fifty or sixty miles . They would go until there was no doubt left in their minds . The evening before their departure they gave each man a drink of whisky , as a kind of good luck token , or possibly as a kind of farewell . They were in Blackfoot country . They knew that Indians would not hesitate at all to attack a party of six or seven men . As he preparedhis pack this evening Lewis was thinking , with wry humor , that during all his years as a soldier he had never carried his own pack . Because he hoped to walk thirty or forty miles a day he took only one blanket , powder and ball , a pair of field glasses and his weapons . Telling the men in camp to get busy dressing hides and making moccasins and garments , and to keep an alert watch day and night , the captains at daylight filled their bellies with boiled elk and corn and set off with their squads . Two days later , Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his mind . Lewis had to go farther before he could be sure . His party ran into a terrific rainstorm . It poured all night without letup and because they had no shelter they were soon soaked and before daylight left what Lewis called their watery beds and set off as drenched as if they had been pulled out of a river . While walking along a precipice Lewis slipped on the wet earth and came within a hair of pitching headlong over the ledge and into the river below . He had hardly recovered his poise when he heard an agonized cry . " Good God , Captain , what shall I do ? " It was Dick Windsor . Lewis looked at him and was horrified . Dick had slipped and fallen and now lay on his belly , his right leg and his right arm hanging over the precipice . Lewis took a moment to consider before he spoke . He was thinking fast . He was saying to himself , " I must speak quietly and with complete assurance , because without confidence he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that his left foot and hand had dug into soaked earth that threatened at any moment to give way . In a voice perfectly calm Lewis said , " You 're all right , you 're in no particular danger at all . Just do as I tell you . Slip your knife out of your belt with your right hand and dig a hole in the bank for your right foot . . . . Careful , now . Easy .... That 's it . Now , slowly  --  very slowly and carefully , hugging the earth as tight as you can , pull yourself up to your knees . Dig your left fingers in deeper , if you can . That 's it : just dig deep  --  and up . That 's it  --  deep and up . . . . Now  --  now with your right hand slip off your mockersons , if you can .. . dig your left toes in . . . that 's it , dig them in . . . . Do you see your knife ? Reach around a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few inches above your right hand . . . . There . Now take your gun in your other hand  --  that 's it  --  and crawl forward on your knees . . . slowly , chest and head down , hug the earth . . . . Slowly . . . that 's it . . . . " Lewis was amazed to see the man do it . When he first saw him , half over the precipice and barely clinging to wet earth , he had not given him one chance in a thousand to save his life . Yet here he was , standing before him , white and shaken . Lewis said , " It was n't so difficult , was it ? " Windsor took a deep breath and grinned . " No , sir , " he said . The other five men had stood back and watched . They were not looking at Dick Windsor . They were looking at Meriwether Lewis , and in the eyes of every one the admiration was bright and plain . Lewis was not aware of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were thinking , This is a leader we can be proud of , or that Dick Windsor was telling himself , " He saved my life . " " I almost fell , " he said to Dick . " I would have gone over but for my espontoon . " Toward evening they killed six fat deer and over a fire roasted the choicest of the meat . They ate like gluttons , for this was their first meal this day . A sun had warmed and dried the earth . After making a mattress of willow boughs Lewis stretched out , hoping for a good night 's rest , reflecting meanwhile in his dry way that a good meal and a dry bed could revive the spirits of the weariest traveler . Over by the fire the six men sat in silence and looked at him . When his party arrived at the main camp he found that Clark had been back two days and was worried about him . He was afraid that Lewis and his men had fallen before the Blackfeet . The captains went off by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our river ? " " The south one . What do you think ? " " The same . " This evening they called the men before them and Lewis then spoke to them , saying , " Captain Clark and I are convinced that the smith river is the main river , but we expect that some of you have another opinion . We have examined our old maps ; we have consultedall the information we have , viewing the matter from every " If we only could ! If only we could take a map of this whole westerncountry to the President ! " " And the Federalists , " Clark said . " Oh yes , the Federalists . " In one of his rare moments of levity Clark said , " We 've just got to find that mountain of salt . " " And the eagle . " The next morning when the captains left their beds they became aware that the Shoshone girl was ill . Clark knelt to look at her and saw that the blood was drained from the copper skin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that her pulse was feeble . After breakfast he opened a vein in her arm to bleed her and massagedalong the vein until he had forced out a pint of blood . She refusedbreakfast , even broth . She was too weak to stand . After mixing a little meal in elk broth Clark took the babe to his lap and fed it . He called it Pomp because pomp , he had heard , was the Shoshone word for the oldest boy in a family . Pomp looked at him with round black eyes . Most of the time he had been a good baby : all day long he stood in the harness on his mother 's back , showing a curious bright interest in what the adults were doing . Clark liked to hold the child . This stern military man even talked a little baby-talk to it , but not so that anybody else could hear . " Pomp , " he said , moving his face close and looking into the sober black eyes , " Pompey boy , you know your mama is ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny neb on Pomp 's face and rubbed it gently . Pomp drew back and turned his lips out and opened his eyes wide . The eyes now reminded Clark of an owl brought from dark into daylight . " Pompey boy , tell your mama to get well fast . Will you ? " When he was dead-sure that no eyes were watching him he took the child close to his chest and gave it a little hug . The next moment he returned it to its mother , and when he came out of the tent his long irregular face was again stern  --  was the face of Captain William Clark of the United States Army and the Corps of Discovery , and not the face of the man deep inside who wanted a wife and children and a home back in Kentucky . . . . Captain Lewis meanwhile was getting ready to go up the south fork . He went among the men , casually looking at their feet ; observinghow they walked ; studying their faces for signs of discouragementor homesickness  --  and chose at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Gibson , Joe Fields and Silas Good/rich . They were four men of unquestioned courage . He had seen them all tried . In an encounter with the Sioux , Silas had recovered his tomahawk from a brave who had taken it from him . Lewis was not feeling well this morning . He swung his pack up and set off with his four men and after only a mile or two realized that he was sick . His sleep for several nights had been restless , filled with a recurring nightmare of men trapped in deep snows while he tried vainly to sail up a swift river to their rescue . He now had violent gut-cramps that bent him double . Clasping his ears , he knew that he had fever . He seemed to be cold , for he had chills . He helped the men dress out four elk and hang the hides and flesh within sight of the river . He had looked forward to a feast of marrowbones , but when the meal was cooked he was unable to eat a thing . The three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him grimace with pain , for he was tortured by sharp thrusts in his bowels . Pushing the pain down in him and trying to ignore it , Lewis forced himself to march mile after mile at the head of his party but toward evening he could endure no more . He had a high fever . He had such convulsions of agony in his lower body that he thought he would faint . He told the men they would camp at once and he asked them to gather for him a bed of willow boughs ; and on this he stretched out and closed his eyes , shuddering the whole length of him with each seizure . He was furious at his weakness in a time of crisis : the hours were passing , back at Maria 's River the Corps was waiting for his return , yet here he lay , barely able to move and so savagely and furiously frustrated that he wanted to die . What , he asked himself , could he do about it ? Was he to let the men make a stretcher and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thunder , he would not : lie would go on if it killed him ; he would get well and he would get well fast . What would his mother , the famous yarb doctor , do for him if she were here ? She would dose him with some of her yarb simples . Thinking of this , he saw no reason why he should not do it , and so called to his men . They came over and looked down at the sweat on his face . He told them to gather an armful of the smaller limbs of the chokecherry ; to strip off the leaves and cut the limbs into short pieces , and then boil them until they had a decoction as thick as molasses . An hour and a half later they brought the kettle to him and a tin cup and he dipped the cup into the thick black stuff and drank it . It was bitter  --  O God , it was even more bitter than aloes ! It was sim/ply the most bitter stuff he had ever tasted and the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lay back to study the sensations within him . Everything inside him now seemed to be gurgling and rumbling but he sensed that the rumbles turned something free and eased the pain ; and an hour later he felt so much better that he drank another pint . He had burst into heavy sweat and he felt horribly weak but steadily he felt better . Two hours later he drank still anotherpint , for Captain Meriwether Lewis was a man who believed that if a little was good for you , a lot was a certain cure . Before midnighthe felt so fully recovered that he walked around to test himselfand the miracle . Silas Goodrich , a youngster who would rather fish than eat , had caught dozens of fine fat trout and Lewis now roasted and ate one . Then he had a good night 's sleep and awoke a new man . The next morning he pushed on with his party and late in the forenoon felt a thrill go through him that left him tingling all over . He stopped , breathless , and listened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the unmistakable sound of falling waters . He hastened forward and after a mile or so stopped again : in the southwestern sky he could see spray rising like broken columns of smoke , and in his ears now was a tremendous roaring . It could come only from the Great Falls on the Missouri . Again he hastened forward and about noon came to the first falls : he had only to look at the churning white water and the boiling fury with which it plunged over a precipice to put all doubts away : this was the falls the Indians had told about , this was the right river . He would send a man to tell Captain Clark and while waiting for the main party to come up he would explore the other falls , for he had known and now could see that there was a whole series of them . In his Journal he wrote that his supper this evening was really sumptuous : he feasted on buffalo hump , tongue and marrowbones ; on roasted trout and parched meal , all of it seasoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off alone to have a look at the other falls and to determine if he could how difficult the portage would be . Soon he was gazing upon a thousand head of buffalo and it occurred to him that it would be sensible to kill one and hang up the choicer parts of the meat , so that if he went so far during the day that he could not return to camp he could spend the night here . Approachingclose to the herd , he chose a fat young heifer and , resting his riflep203over the upturned end of his espontoon , he took careful aim and fired . The beast did not fall or move but red blood poured in streams from its mouth and nostrils , and so Lewis waited , looking at it and expecting it to fall . He had not bothered to reload his gun . He had no sense of the presence of an enemy and so was completelyastounded when , glancing behind him , he saw a monstrous grizzly creeping up , at a distance of no more than sixty feet . Goosefleshcovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw that the monster had abandoned his stealthy advance and was ready to charge . In the fraction of a second Lewis had looked round him and had seen that there was not a bush or tree , neither precipice nor neb of stone , within a distance of four hundred yards . In that same fraction of a second he felt a stinging sensation up the back of his neck and heard a queer rumble in his belly . His thoughts in this instant were racing like lightning : among them stood one , larger than all others : it said , Sometimes if you back away slowly you confusea wild beast and he will retreat . . . . But the moment he started to back away the monster gave off a roar that shook the earth , and came at full speed , his enormous mouth wide open . Holding on to both his gun and espontoon , Lewis took to his heels , and later , when telling the men ( who laughed till they thought they would die ) , he said that for eighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreamed that he could run so fast . William Bratton 's race , he said , had been the crawl of the tortoise compared to his own . But even so , the bear gained on him : he thought he could feel the creature'sbreath ; he was sure that he could hear the soft muffled blows of its feet ... . Knowing that in another moment or two he would be seized and that his organs would be gutted out of him with one sweep of the huge talons , Lewis swung sharply to the right , where , though he doubted his senses , he saw the river . He plunged in . His thought was to get into water deep enough that while he could stand the bear would have to swim . And so he plunged in and forward until the water was almost to his chin , when , turning , he raised his espontoon in his right hand , intending to strike the beast an awful blow across his tender nose . But the bear , to Lewis 's amazement , wanted none of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his small stupid eyes looking , but when he saw the espontoon rise and flash in the sun and heard his foe 's wild screaming cry of challenge he turned as if in great fright and hastened away at full speed.  |p204His  amazement growing , Lewis waded to the bank and while reloadinghis gun watched the monster rush away . The most astonishingthing for Lewis was that though the bear ran as fast as he could go he kept looking back , as if imagining that he was pursued . When the bear vanished from sight Lewis looked carefully round him to see if another beast was sneaking up on him . Then with a short queer laugh he said , " Well , I 'll be damned ! " His emotions were badly mixed . He knew that again he had come within a hair of losing his life but the thing that disturbed him most was that he felt like an utter greenhorn . He had told his men never to go alone into grizzly land and always to reload as quickly as possible , yet he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all through him , as though he were recovering from a fever . He went on up the river and presently was gazing with astonishmentat another beast . At first he thought it was a wolf but on approachingwithin fifty yards he saw that it was of brownish color and was standing at the entrance of what seemed to be a burrow . What on earth could this be ? As he continued to approach , the beast crouched like a cat and seemed ready to spring . He took careful aim and fired . The creature vanished . After reloading his gun he went forward to examine the spot . He saw around the hole the footprintsof some member of the cat family . Dropping to his knees , he peered into the burrow and would not have been surprised if he had seen yellow eyes looking out at him . He sniffed the scent : it was un -- familiar , and wild and strong . Standing again and looking round him , he reflected that today for some mysterious reason the whole animal-world seemed bent on his death . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards from the hole of the tiger-cat , three buffalo bulls suddenly left the herd and charged full speed toward him . Instead of running , he advancedswiftly to meet them , aware that he was foolhardy but piqued by the way wild beasts seemed to be singling him out for destruction . The bulls came on a tail-flirting dead-run until they were a hundred yards from him . They then stopped and looked him over . As suddenly as they had charged they swung and , tails flirting , rushed away . " I 'll be damned ! " Lewis said again . All these experiences had unnerved him a little . He thought it prudent to give up the idea of spending the night alone , and so headed back toward his own small camp . Darkness overtook him.  |p205He  heard again and again the rattles of rattlesnakes . He flinched when he felt the thorns of prickly pear go through his moccasins . He saw huge shadowy forms out in the dusk and sometimes whole herds of shadow ; and once he was sure he saw a grizzly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firelight an hour before he was to reach it and fling himself down on his bed of willow boughs , a wry humor playing over all his emotions as he looked back on the strange adventuresof this day.  |p206Ca|ptain  Clark meanwhile had been having troubles of a different kind . He was afraid that the Shoshone girl was going to die , now that they were drawing near to her people and would most need her . Two of his men had aching teeth ; two had large tumors ; one had a tumor and fever ; but it was Jawey to whom he gave his time and skill . About four o'clock in the afternoon of the day Lewis ran from the bear , Joe Fields walked in from the southwest with a note saying that the Great Falls had been found on the south fork , twenty miles in advance of the main party . Early the next morning Clark set forth with his group and all day long he had nothing but trouble . The river was swifter than it had been ; the boatmen toiled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Journal was to call " incretiatable . " The Indian girl was so sick that she had no wish to live : Clark dosed her with steeped barks and applied various poultices to her and thought she felt a little better . He wondered if her sickness was related to her menses . The men towing the canoes repeatedly cut their feet on the sharp stones , or slipped on wet stones and fell ; or if towing from the bank they had to look for cactus and rattlesnake at literally every step . Jawey was so sick that she had been wild with delirium . Clark suspected that two or three days ago , after she had got to feeling better , she had slipped away and eaten ravenously of fish and what her man called white apples . Clark had then tried poultices of bark and laudanum and had confided to his Journal that if she died , her stupid husband would be the fault of it . He had told Charbonneaup207not to let her eat more than meat broth . As the party moved slowly up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes closed , her hands pressing on the pain in her belly . Three or four times a day Clark had held the babe to her breasts and then had fed him a little corn meal in warm meat soup . After Lewis rejoined the main party and saw how sick the girl was he felt pity for her , as well as concern for the success of his adventure . When one of the men reported the presence of a hot sulphur spring he told Ordway to bring a quart of the water , and with the squawman 's help he persuaded her to drink it . Perceiving that this did her no good , he gave her a pint of the bitter chokecherry concoction and a big dose of opium . He asked her man where her pain was . Charbonneau put his hands to his lower abdomenand pressed in . After studying his list of medicines Lewis decided to apply to her belly a cataplasm of bark and laudanum . To Clark he said , " I expect she suffers from an obstruction of the menses . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant again ? " " Her man says she is not . " " If she dies , what 'll we do with a baby four months old ? " When Clark gave no reply , Lewis said with dry whimsy , " Shoot a buffalo mother every day ? " " Soon there 'll be no more buffalo , " Clark said . " I expect , though , it could live on meal and meat broth . " Lewis covered the girl 's belly with a large hot bark poultice , tucked warm buffalo robes snugly around her and put a flat heated stone under her lower back . The next day she was much better ; her fever was gone and her pulse was normal . Lewis told himself that he was not a bad physician after all . His mother might be proud of him . When the girl said she was hungry he gave her sparingly of boiled flesh and hot rich broth . Meanwhile he had other problems . Clark had gone ahead with a small party to discover the length and difficulties of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grizzly bear that pursued him almost into the camp and came within only a few feet of catchinghim . When he saw the man coming and heard his wild cries for help Lewis realized that John Colter , out looking for axle timber , was somewhere in the area from which the bear had come and to which it was now returning . Lewis called three of the best hunters and gave chase . The bear had indeed found and pursued Colter :  |p208Lewis  and his party found the youth out in the river almost to his chin , with the bear facing him from the bank . The beast then fled , and because night had come Lewis returned with his men to the camp . It was no less than a miracle , he was thinking , that so many of the men had been pursued by this monster and almost overtaken , yet none had been seized . He had heard a sound now and then which he took to be thunder but Joe Fields , who had been farther up the river , said it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains . Lewis spent an hour listening to it and at last decided that it was like the sound of a piece of ordnance of six pounds , at a distance of five or six miles . He went for a walk to the higher hills and spent an hour or two listening ; and then wrote in his Journal : " I heard this nois very distinctly , it was perfectly calm clear and not a cloud to be seen . . . . I have no doubt but if I had leasure I could find from whence it issued . I have thought it probable that it might be caused by running water in some of the caverns of those emence mountains . . . but in such a case the sounds would be periodical and regular , which is not the case with this , being sometimes heard once only and at other times several discharges in quick succession . it is heard also at different times of the day and night . I am at a great loss to account for this Phenomenon . I well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great noise , but they could not tell me the cause ... . The other men of the party also listened to the strange sounds and gazed wonderingly at each other . One suggested that high up there was a river falling into an echoing cavern , the irregularity of the sound being determined by the wind . Another thought it was some kind of volcanic eruptions from a fissure , like steam blowing from a tea kettle . For the more superstitious men it was an infernal noise right out of hell and speculation about it was impious . It gave all the men a feeling of chills and apprehension : what kind of unknownworld were they about to enter and what marvels would they find there ? " If we do n't find out what it is , " John Colter said , " I 'd like to come back someday and run it down . " " All alone , I suppose , " Bob Frazier said . The sound and the thought of back-breaking labor over a sixteenmileportage were too much for the squawman : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whine to his sergeant . He had had enough ofp209this voyage ; he wanted to go back . Deep down in him the man was afraid . He had come about a thousand miles from the Minnetaree villages and he asked himself day and night how many more thousands of miles the captains expected to cover . He stared at the stupendousmountains before him , blanketed by snows and shrouded by mists ; he remembered that there would be no buffalo there or beyond them and probably no friends either ; he looked at the men and saw that they had lost weight and were now haggard and olderlooking ; he observed that the river had become swifter , the stones thicker and sharper ; like the others , he now fought mosquitoes day and night and small black fleas , and he decided that he had had enough of it . He told his wife they were going back . She looked at him and shook her head no . He ordered her to put the matter up to Captain Lewis , for he was afraid of both captains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved to tell the captain himself  --  not Clark , whose sternness paralyzed him , but Lewis , who seemed more in- dulgent . Incredulous , Lewis looked at the man . " What did you say ? " he asked , his slate-gray eyes turning hard . " Aye va-wee pore , " said the squawman , grimacing with his hands , shoulders and face . " Oh , aye caret-ched mann ! Mee pore vives , me ba-bees ! " " O God yes , your poor wives and babies ! You mean you want to go back down the Missouri ? " " Oui , Cap-n . " " And take this wife and child with you ? " " Oui , Cap-n . " " And you want Captain Clark and me to give you a canoe , a gun and powder and ball , bedding , a keg of pork , some corn meal ? " " Oui  --  oui , " said Charbonneau , nodding his head . Lewis stepped close to him and tried to look into the half-lidded shifting eyes . " Shobono @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , no matter what you do . If you want to go back , go ; and yonder in grizzly land always shoot straight up at the sky . If the Blackfeet take after you , shoot at the sky or dive into a bramble thicket . You may have a gun , some powder and ball , one blanket , enough food for two days . " " Laissez-moi passer ! " Lewis did not understand the words but he understood the tone . His temper burst . " Look , Shobono ! " he cried , turning to a group of men fifty yards distant who were laboring to build a cart . " Get overp210there and get to work ! " He called over to Gass , " Sergeant , put this man to work and work him hard ! " Surly and angry , the squawman shuffled away . Lewis followed him over to see how the work was going , for of all the wood available none was hard enough for axles , none of it better than the wild cherry . The men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large two-wheel cart , on which to transport the baggage seventeen or eighteen miles over hills and gullies . The terrain that hugged the river was what Lewis thought of as a mess of badlands  --  of stone barriers , steep hills and ravines , washouts , ledges , all of it impassable to men with burdens ; and so it had been necessary to find a route at a considerable distance back from the river . This lay over gentler hills and through narrow valleys . Even if they successfully built a cart the Corps would be delayed two or three weeks , when summertime , the thing it needed most of , would be running out . During these days Lewis was a worried man . How many and how long would the portages be on other rivers ? How far would they have to traipse overland from headwaters to headwaters ? Would the Shoshones let them have horses ? He had to face these questions becausebefore leaving Mandan he had written his President that on reaching the Great Falls he would send a part of the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . He now felt that they would need every man they had . He put the matter to Clark and Clark said , " I expect we will . " " But has it occurred to you what will happen if we send none of the men back ? " Clark looked away at the sky , thinking . He turned at last to Lewis . " What ? " he said . " Everybody will figure we 've all been wiped out . They 'll think the Blackfeet got us . Around Fort Mandan nobody will doubt it . " " Nobody at all , " Clark said . " Word will go down the river by traders that it 's the end of us . Will the President send a ship in that case ? " " Well , I expect he would n't . If all such people as the traders figure we 're all dead the President could hardly think anything else . " " But we 'll need that ship , " Lewis said . " Would our men face the prospect of fighting these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . If we let two or three go back how would the others feel ? " The captains named them over one by one and decided that mostp211of them would feel all right but some of them , perhaps a third of them , possibly even half of them , would not . They were a bold and gallant crew but this clawing their way up icy rivers and over cactus thorns was more than some of them had bargained for . It was easy to spot those who would go on in the face of hell  --  Colter , Shannon , the Fields brothers , Collins , Willard , Drewyer , Bratton , Whitehouse , the sergeants and a few others ; but in the faces of some of the men the captains had seen an emotion that looked like homesickness . It was a good thing , Lewis said , that the men knew nothing about the promise to Jefferson . For two overpowering reasons , the captains decided , they would send nobody back : they would need all the men through the vast unknown that still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or if not mutiny , then at least a lowering of morale and a division in the ranks , if they let any of the men return . The prospect tickled Lewis 's sardonic sense of humor . Grinning at Clark , he said , " Well , now that it 's decided , we are all dead men  --  and one dead woman and child . From Mandan clear to Washington will go the news , They are all dead ! The Blackfeet got them ! " Then thought of his mother 's grief occurred to him and he sobered . " The grief in the relatives of all of us , " he said , " that 's the worst part of it . " He was about to propose that they send Charbonneau back with a message but thought better of it : the clumsy squawman would be killed by Indians or grizzlies before he got to the Yellow Stone ; and besides , it was a rule with the captains that once they had agreed on a thing , there was to be no reconsideration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no Hamlet in him . " Yes , " Clark said , " that 's a bad thing about it but they 'll all get over it . " " Except for that , " said the whimsical Lewis , " I sort of enjoy the prospect . If we do return , how astonished everyone will be  --  includingyour Judith . Especially , " said Lewis slyly , " if she should be married . " Clark said nothing . He had no taste for such jests . " Come to think of it , " Lewis went on , " I expect a ship will be there . Mr. Jefferson has a wonderful imagination . He 'll think of all the possibilities . One will be that we 're all dead . Another will be that the messengers were killed on their way back . " " That surely will occur to him , " Clark said . " That may seem more likely to him than the other . A third pos/sibility is that the message went astray somewhere on its long journey to Washington . A fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thought Lewis was working pretty hard to put a cheerful face on the thing . A few of the men were laboring on a bullboat . All the way from St. Louis , Lewis had brought a heavy iron frame over which he dreamed of spreading and sewing hides , to make a round boat that would carry four tons . He was , Clark reflected , the sort of man given to such fancies . Clark had never taken the plan seriously but had masked his feelings , as he always did when he thought his romantic and impulsive friend a little ridiculous . He granted him the right nevertheless to emulate Mr. Jefferson , who was everlastingly trying to invent something . The day he was chased by the white bear Lewis had wondered in his whimsical way if the whole animal-world had entered a league for his destruction . When the long and arduous portage began he suspected that all the elements of nature had conspired to dishearten his men , wear them out and delay the journey , for there was one minor disaster after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cart of native timbers , all of them soft wood , with fat thick twenty-two-inch wheels and a frail axle ; and to the cart they attached sails , for Lewis believed that a wind against the sails would equal the power of three or four men on a rope . But not the power of three or four Yorks , he admitted , watching the herculean labors of the huge Negro . York , it seemed to him , had lost thirty or forty pounds but he was still a giant , and stripped to his waist with sweat running off him in small rivers he pulled with the power of a horse . But the wood was so soft and brittle that one axle after another shattered and collapsed . After a new axle was put in , the whole preposterous thing creaked and swayed from side to side as a dozen men on elkskin traces , pulling like oxen in yokes , clawed and stumbled and fought their way up the stony or grassy slopes , seizing anything they could lay a hand on to anchor themselves while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but none of them told himself any more that a woman was present . Never in their lives had the captains seen men toil with such unflagging and dauntless will , without a word of complaint , even when they fell fainting from exhaustion or dying of thirst . The slave-girl lugged forward burdens that no man would have believed she could move.  |p213It  was a dreadful ordeal under a sun that was like a furnace . The first day of the portage every man thought he would fall from thirst and rise no more . They were far from the river and had only a few light vessels to bring water in . All day in the awful heat they labored , falling only to rise and struggle forward and fall again ; and the Indian girl , sitting a few moments to rest , looked at them and marveled and looked at their captains . Why did they want to take boats over the hills and valleys this way ? Why did n't they go find her people and borrow horses if they could not buy them . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dog led the choked men to a small pool of brackish water and they drank ; and then with no wood anywhere around them with which to make fires , and no water in which to boil meat even if they had wood , they lay down and slept . But they were cheerful . There were so many things on earth , Bob Frazier said , whose lot was worse than their own . There were the buffalo , the stupid beasts : on the riverbanks as the men came up had been hundreds of dead animals that had drowned : above the falls a herd would go to the river to drink , and those drinking would be shoved in by those pushing forward from behind . The beasts shoved in would swim with wild energy but the boiling down-sucking current was too much for them and over the falls they would go , a score , a hundred , all in a few minutes . Captain Clark and the men with him who had gone upriver to explore said they had never seen a one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were borne down and under in the deep maelstroms , and over the next fall ; and there was no sign of them in the next inferno of raging waters . They were borne over another fall and still another , until beached at last and left to the wolves and bears . The second portage day the men had to rest more frequently , and most of them , on halting , immediately flung themselves down . With arms and legs stretched out and eyes closed they rested , breathing deep . Now and then in the heat one would faint and fall and some of the others would fan him and chafe his wrists ; but like the good adventurer he was he would rise and toil again . They had two camps , an upper and a lower , with Clark at the lower and Lewis at the upper camp . Each day they portaged between the camps and moved the camps each night . As though the conspiring elements had given up the thought of destroying the men with heat , hunger , thirst and toil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hail struck andp214it was such hail as no man among them had ever seen . At that moment the men were stripped to their waists . They were bareheaded . The hailstones struck their skulls and one after another among the men went down , knocked senseless . Clark later reported to Lewis from the lower camp that he had expected a number of the men to be killed . It took more than gigantic hailstones to take the whimsy out of Meriwether Lewis : with a gay gesture he picked up one of the largest stones and after measuring and weighing it announced to the men that it was seven inches in circumference and weighed three ounces . He poured water into a tin pail , dropped the huge white stone into the water and said the men could now look upon the finest punch in the world . Will Bratton , lying back and breathing hard , saw nothing funny in what the captain was saying . He had been knocked down three times and was bleeding from three wounds . Three times , he was thinking with horror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron fist and had gone down . Twice he had struggled to his feet . On being felled a third time he had decided to stay down and think it over . With fingers he explored the wounds in his skull and the blood that had spilled down over his face . The sudden squall lifted as suddenly as it had come and again a hot June sun was blazing on the men . Those who came closest to death during the weeks at the Great Falls were Clark and the squawman and his family . Clark had made and then lost some notes on the falls and was again writing down his observations when in the west he saw a black cloud rising . It seemed so deadly with menace that he began to look for shelter , suspecting that a violent wind might soon be upon him . The storms here were unpredictable . As Lewis had said in his Journal , the same cloud would discharge hail in one area , hail and rain in another and nothing but rain in a third , all within the space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every man to his marrow or blow him down . With Charbonneau and his wife and child Clark hastened into a deep ravine , where a stone ledge lay out in a large flat shelf . Under this shelf the four of them waited for the wind and rain to strike . The two men laid their guns aside . Back under the stone ledge Clark put his compass and , on second thought , his powder horn , shot pouch and tomahawk . Then he peered out to see if a storm was coming . He was thinking that if the hail had been as severe on the portage pathp215as on either side of it , most of the members and possibly all the members of the Corps would have been killed . There came first a gust of rain driven by a violent wind . Sacajawea carried her child in what Clark called a bier and Ordway called a net : she now set this at her feet and put into it the blanket in which her babe had been wrapped . She laid the babe on the blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were quite clean for a squaw ; that the child -- - At that moment he heard a dreadful sound . He was to conclude later that it had been a cloudburst up the hillside . Almost at once a roaring deluge came down upon them , driving and tumbling and rolling enormous stones before it ; and with amazement Clark perceived that the water was up to his knees almostbefore he knew that water had come . An instant later it was up to his waist . There were horrible sounds above him and in the sky overhead ; and there were sounds of great boulders plunging into the water of the ravine . It had all been so sudden and overwhelming that his senses had been dulled . With one hand he seized his gun ; with the other , the Indian girl , who at that moment snatched up her child but had no time to take the blanket and basket . Thrusting her before him , he frantically clawed his way up over the shelving and sought desperately to find something to cling to . Charbonneau had made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hole , when , pausing and reaching back down , he made foolish and futile movements , as though to rescue his wife and child . Not more than two seconds later he turned rigid with fright . He just stood there , stooped , his black eyes bugged out in horror at the overpoweringtorrent of water and mud and stones that came roaring down the hill . Clark shouted to him to move and save himself , and after another two or three seconds the stupid fellow did utter a shriek of terror and begin to scramble upward . Clark was still sheltering and assisting the woman and child ; trying to watch the avalanches above him , the rising water below him ; hugging the girl to him to keep her from falling and shouting in her ear to clutch the babe close to her ; digging with his feet to try to find toeholds ; yelling to the paralyzed and gawking squawman to clamber up before he was drowned or crushed ; and never pausing in his superhuman efforts until the four of them were safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down into the hole . The water , he judged , was fifteen feet deep ud was boiling round and round in a frenzied mud-bath . The In/dian girl was looking at him . She was looking as a woman will look at a man who has just saved her own and her child 's life . She was thinking , Chief Red Hair saved my son and me from death ! Chief Red Hair was thinking , 0 Lord God , I 've lost my shot pouch , my powder horn and my compass ! York , the huge black man , had come rushing up , crying , " Masta , is you safe ? " " Safe , " Clark said calmly , " but wet . " He was wet to his waist , the Indian girl to her chin . The child had been drenched . Seeing that both mother and babe were shivering , he took her arm and hastened with her back to the camp and there he poured down her throat a half a cup of whisky . Her child he wrapped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt so shatteredby the loss of the compass  --  for the Corps had no other large one  --  that he was hardly aware of what he was doing , and not at all aware of the way an Indian girl 's black eyes were looking at him . She had drunk the whisky . She had slipped out of her wet leather garments and now sat with a robe around her , with the child on her lap under the robe . She still trembled from the cold but she was happier than she had ever been in her life . She had not known that there were men in the world who would risk their own lives to save the lives of women and children . She had known none among the red people , not even among her own people . But this white man had lost his compass and had got his watch wet just to save her : he could so easily have leapt out , leaving her and Pomp , but he had taken them both with him , ahead of him , his strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to look her way she cast her gaze down but the moment she felt that she could do so unobserved she again looked at Red Hair , knowing that alone and without help she could never have got out of that dreadful hole . It had all come down as if a sky of water and stones had fallen : she would have been knocked senseless and drowned before she knew it , and her son with her , but for the swiftness of this strange man who had put their lives before his own . Under the robe she patted her child , thinking , remembering  --  her shy Indian eyes watching a man with red hair who was coaxing a wet fire to life . After the fire was blazing he beckoned her over to it and she went over , marveling : not only had he saved her life and given her whisky when he had so little left , but now he wanted her and her son to be warm ! She , captured as a child , and after that the slave/mistress of any man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bed  --  a beast of burden at other times  --  a slave , an enemy , a woman  --  a creatureto be knocked senseless at her master 's pleasure , or killed  --  these things but no more she had been until this day , but now she was more . A man had been tender to her  --  had lost big medicine for her and risked his life for her ! It was all so incredible that she had to tell herself the wonder of it over and over ... . She patted her child , thinking , If we 'd been alone with your father we 'd both be dead now , little Pomp ! This was the first time she had thought of her child as Pomp : an obedient wife , she had thought of him as Jean Baptiste , but he would be Pomp now , for that was the name Chief Red Hair had given him . Red Hair had named a river for her and she had been so moved that she had wept . She thought he intended to name a river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words but she could not always understand what the captain said , though she could always tell what his eyes said . She had known what they said one day after her man had struck her . Until then , she had not known that any man in the world cared about what a man did to a woman . For a while on this journey she had wondered if he might want her in the way men wanted women but had decided that he did not . Even more incredible , for her , was the fact that this white man had decided that no other man would have her either , except the man who owned her . At first she had thought she would be the woman of all the men in the Corps but she had been only Charbonneau 's woman and she could not understand why this was so . She was not sure that she understood why both captains were kind to her . With a woman 's intuitions she could read the eyes of some of the men when they looked at her but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her into the thickets or catch her alone . Not a one had ever come to her when , alone with her child , she was looking for roots or berries . For weeks this had puzzled her . Then little by little she had come to understand that Red Hair was her protector and guardian and that dreadful things might happen to any man who tried to take her in love . She was afraid that dreadful things might happen to her man before this journey was done , for she knew that he lived in fear of both captains and that the captains detested him . She knew that her man was a coward . She had not known at first that he was jealous . This she had discovered one day when he struck her . Chief Long Knife , she had been quick to learn , preferred certainp218morsels in a meat dish and with a long spoon tried to find them . Chief Red Hair ate what he first came to and seemed never to be aware of what he was eating . He ate like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain root and a cook had prepared a whole kettleful . Watching Red Hair eat the roots , she had realized that he liked them and the next day she had gone looking for roots , just for him . She had given them to him in her shy way and had not known that her man was spying on her . When alone with her that evening he had struck her . He had struck her a hard blow with the back of his hand right across her mouth and when she ducked her head and shrank away from him she felt the blood on her lips . That night he had taken her , but with more than his usual savagery : he had dug deep into her flesh with his fingers , into the soft part of her just above her hips . When he was done with her he had shoved her away and given her a blow of contempt across her rump . She would have thought nothing of it if she had not known these white men . Now she spent a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her man struck her she tried to hide her bruised lips but she knew that Red Hair had seen them . He did not have the way of a man who saw everything but he saw everything . She knew that he had seen her lips when she saw him look at her man ... After learning that her man was jealous she knew that he would strike her if he saw her do little things for Chief Red Hair . Just the same , she intended to do things for him . He was the only friend she had ever had since she was taken from her people . He had been kind to her in so many ways  --  and today he had saved her life and her child 's life , and had given her a drink of the precious firewater , and had built a fire for her . . . . Shyly she raised her eyes to look at him again.  |p219When  the last of the portaging was done the men sank to the earth , where they stood and slept all night and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparing a treat for them  --  a feast of the choicest parts of buffalo , roasted , and suet dumplings of meat , flour and sugar . Some of the men observed that he gave the Indian girl an extra helping . This evening the men danced and sang , and York jigged and capered with such wanton eye-rolling abandon that in his Journal his master said that he " carried on turribel . " The dog barked in a frenzied way during the hours of dancing and then barked all night . Until his bedtime Lewis gazed thoughtfully at the men , or at the mountains in the west , his mind teeming with problems and questions . His bullboat had been a ludicrous failure . There was no good canoe timber in this area . The Corps had spent a full month here at the falls and soon it would be autumn , snow would be falling again . Upon both captains had come a sense of urgency , and as their anxiety sharpened they looked more frequently at the sky and the west . They looked at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them now , for they were bearded and long-haired and ragged . Clark was still wearing his tattered artillerist 's outfit but most of the men were in hand-sewn skins that were torn and scuffed , and frayed open at elbows and knees . Some of them braided their snarled and uncombed hair because when braided it was less of a bother ; but some of them just let it hang loose and wind-blown down over their ears and shoulders . They were a tough-looking lot andp220they were tougher than they looked , Lewis reflected , watching them caper in square dances , while Cruzatte sawed on his fiddle and Potts called the turns . Yes , it was a tough crew . In boldness and resourcefulness Lewis would have matched most of them against men anywhere . None but the squawman had yet complained . The Indian girl had confided to Clark that Whitehouse had been ill when she was ill and had almost died . This had astonished the captain : Whitehouse had labored every day , without complaint . In his own Journal he had confessed that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers had been as sick as a dog , yet had hidden his illness from nearly everyone . There was an esprit de corps here that looked with contempt on signs of weakness and made the squawman a symbol of what the other men would rather have died than be . Yes , good Lord , they were tough but would they endure to the end ? No man could know what lay ahead of them now ; what starvationwhen they left buffalo land ; what cold and snows ; what hostile Indians ; what interminable distances . The middle of July they packed their canoes and went on : they had passed clear through Blackfoot land and had not seen an Indian ; they should be in Snakelandsoon , though the girl did not yet recognize any landmarks or know where they were . The buffalo were now the thickest they had ever seen  --  vast herds darkened the prairies for miles and miles . There were ripening wild fruits now  --  yellow and black currants , gooseberries , serviceberries , chokecherries : the men wolfed them down , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fruit would help to clear up their boils . Sacajawea daily slipped away to gather fruit by the pailful , and to find some choicer berries for Chief Red Hair . Feeling hard-pressed for time , Lewis decided to take two or three men and push on . To Clark he said , " If I can find the pass through the mountains we might save a few days . " " It should be where the river leaves them , " Clark said , looking at the Rockies . He could see no sign of a pass anywhere . " I 'd better take a couple of invalids . Potts is no good for anything now . " " Better take Drewyer . We 'll need a lot of dried meat . " Lewis took Drewyer and two very tired men but he did not push far . The very next day Clark and his river-party overtook them and it was then decided that Clark should take two or three men and go on ahead , until he came to the Shoshone Indians . The truth was that Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insatiablecuriosity was repeatedly engaged . The big-horned animals left him popeyed because of the amazing agility with which they bounded from stone to stone , where one misstep would have been certain death . Clark , when he set out for a goal , pushed steadily on , allowingnothing to divert him . Every day the party 's hunters were firing their guns and Clark was afraid that gunfire would alarm the Shoshones and send them deep into the mountains . If he were to go at top speed ahead of the main party he might reach the Indians before they were alarmed , and convince them that these men approaching with thunder-weapons were not Blackfeet but their friends . " You 're absolutely right , " Lewis said . " If they go back into the mountains we 'll never get horses . What on earth would we do then ? " " We 'd have to winter here . " " What does the squaw say ? " " She says we 'll scare her people clear out of the country . Somewherein the southwest there are caves they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . " " Caves with ice in July ? " " According to her . She says her people wo n't wait to see what weare . When they hear the guns they 'll think we 're Blackfeet and they 'll go . " " Maybe they 've already gone . " " That 's what I 'm afraid of . " " Well , you 'd better take good men and leave the invalids with me . " " One good man , " Clark said . The river had become swifter , the work with the boats was mankilling : Clark chose Joe Fields as his good man , together with Potts , who looked sick , and his black servant . He intended to lose no time but at once ran into difficulties . Potts was so feeble that he was unable to keep up and every mile or so Clark had to halt and wait for him . The prickly pear so completely covered the earth that most of the time it was impossible to find a safe place for a moccasined foot . The mosquitoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled and darkened the sky . The four men were all suffering from fatigue , and even Joe Fields , even the giant York , walked like old men . At night without mosquito nets they got little sleep and arosep222at daylight , bone-tired and depressed , to fight their way again across pathless country over the dreadful thorns . The evening of their second day out they sat by a small fire of buffalo dung , each man drawing a foot up to look at the cuts and bruises and imbedded thorns , all the while swatting angrily at the mosquitoes that swarmed in clouds around him . Not a one of them said a word . They all bent to the task of killing mosquitoes and pullingthorns out of torn feet . From his two feet Clark drew seventeen , some of them half an inch long ; and when he stood up his feet felt so tender and throbbed so with pain that he wondered if he would be able to walk the next day . He felt half-sick and quite discouraged , but the face his men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out to do or die . Lewis and his party were having a dreadful time . The river had become violent in most of its channel , and so filled with enormous stones over which the water boiled that it was impossible to use oars . The men had to use poles , or tow-ropes ; most of the time they had to drag the canoes close to a bank , and they slipped and fell on the wet stones or disappeared momentarily in the plunging rapids . They had to seize anything on the bank that they could cling to with one hand , while with all their strength they pulled a canoe up abreast of them , and stood breathing hard a few moments before making the next move . Along the bank the rattlesnakes were so thick that the men had to look at every stone before they touched it . They were drenched from head to feet in water which in the dim sunless canyon was like winter water . Some had sprained shoulders or backs ; some had boils ; some had fevers and loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swollen feet . How long , 0 Lord , they wondered , would they have to claw their way up this river between these high sheer walls that shut out the sun ? How many miles would it be ? Nobodyknew . The Indian girl did n't know where they were . Her people were yonder , she said , pointing ; it was always yonder , always somewhere off in the west . The morning after Clark pulled the thorns from his feet Lewis looked up the river and saw smoke . He saw great billows of smoke , whole clouds of it , and wondered if the Indians had seen the white men and set signal fires , or if Clark and his men had accidentally fired the mountains . Sacajawea thought the fires had been set by her people to call the hunters home . If this was so , would they all flee beyond the mountains , far into the west , even to the ice caves ?  --  orP223would they hide and wait ? She did not know . Her man said they would hide but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This evening the prickly pears so completely covered the earth where the party camped that the men could n't find room for a bed . They had to take hatchets and clear the ground . But there was one great blessing , Sergeant Ordway said , looking round him cheerfully : though the dog was unable to catch the adult geese that were so plentiful along the river he caught and fetched to the camp enough of the young fat goslings to make a feast . The cooks steamed a big kettleful of wild cucumbers and onions , and Sacajawea came in with a pail of large blue serviceberries , her child standing up her back with mosquitoes so thick over his face that it was almost hidden . The men ate geese and elk , vegetables and fruit ; slapped at the hordes of mosquitoes ; examined their aching feet , their shredded moccasins , their boils ; and jested when they rolled into bed . They would jest , Lewis thought , but not forever : there was the point at which they would reach mutiny . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already a hint of autumn in the mountain air . He felt desperate and wondered what Clark was doing . Clark at the moment was so bruised and cut and had such a swollenand painful ankle that he decided to wait for the canoes . He also felt dispirited . He added only a few sentences to his Journal , then pulled his robe over him , seeking sleep . But his ankle throbbed so with pain that he spent a restless and miserable night . The next day was July zznd . About boon the Indian girl went shyly to Lewis and made him understand that she now recognized this country , that this was one of the rivers on which her people lived . Lewis told the sergeants and they told the men and there were loud whoops of joy . Some of them behaved as they might have if they had reached the ocean . " The three forks ! " one of them was yelling . " You dumb stunners realize we 're close to the three forks ? " " Close to the Columbia ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our butts and float downstream ! Holy grandma ! " They stared into the west as though by looking hard they might see the three forks but they all knew that between them and the Columbia stood a stupendous mountain range . Still , they could not be far from the Snake Indians , not far from the headwaters of thep224Missouri , upon which no white man had yet looked . They were eager to be off . Just at dusk the main party saw Clark and his men waiting for them on a riverbank . They put over with the canoes and took on board the men and what remained of an elk and a deer and went over to an island to camp . Clark , Lewis thought , looked ill and exhausted . His feet were so covered with infected sores and his ankle so swollen that he moved only in great pain ; but nevertheless he planned to push on again in the morning . " You 'd better stay with the boats and let me go , " Lewis said . " I 'm all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look all right . Look at that ankle . " Lewis knew what the trouble was . It was pride . For a week now Clark had been trying to discover the Indians and had failed ; he had got himself sick , he had worn out his men ; and now he was in a bad mood with himself . A man who had fought Indians and the wildernesssince boyhood did not give up easily . Understanding the chagrin and frustration inside Clark , Lewis said tactfully , " Better choose good men this time . We 'll make out all right with the boats . " Clark knew that Lewis was putting the best face on the thing . They were n't making out all right at all . Half the boatmen were sick , the others were in constant pain from boils , cuts and infected sores . The men expected any day now to find impassable stone slides in these awful canyons , or waterfalls that they could n't go over or portagearound . The next morning they watched Clark limp away with his men , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any that ever fell upon Egypt : billions of huge mosquitoes whose hunger made them indifferent to danger ; billions of huge gnats that got into the men 's nostrils and ears and the corners of their eyes and down their throats ; and the millions of prickly pears . Two days later Clark and the four men with him reached the three forks of the Missouri . Without even pausing to rest , the captaintrudged back and forth from stream to stream , trying to determinewhich was the largest and therefore the main current . But the north and middle forks were of almost exactly the same size , with the same kind of bed and stones and water . Because the north fork went in a more westerly direction the harassed and exhausted explorerdecided to follow it , and after leaving a note for Lewis pushed on with his men.  |p225With  rarely a pause to rest , Clark led them on and upward for twenty miles . Bob Frazier then called to him , saying , " Captain , our squawman says he 's tuckered out . " Clark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted the squawman but Charbonneau had begged to be taken and Clark had yielded , not from bad judgment but from weariness . " Ca n't he walk at all ? " Clark asked , observing that the squawman was sitting . " Captain , he says his ankle has plumb give out . " " Tell him to rest a little while , " Clark said , and at once left his men to make observations . He had come at last to mountains that were rocky and steep . The river here was channeled by a number of small islands and , looking over at them , Clark saw deer and elk and what he took to be a grizzly bear . All around him hung ripened masses of red , black , yellow and purple currants , as well as chokecherries , and a red berry which neither captain could identify . Clark gathered berries and ate , meanwhile studying the mountains west of him . He was nearly twenty-five hundred miles from the mouth of the Missouri and the Columbia seemed as far away as ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood together looking at the white Rockies , Lewis had said , " It 's tall country . " " It 's damned big country , " Clark had said . " Bigger than I ever dreamed of , bigger than what Mr. Jefferson has in mind . " " He thought we 'd be back in a year . " " It will be two . " " Or three , " Clark said . The next morning Clark told Charbonneau to stay with Joe Fields , who had swollen feet ; and with Frazier and Reuben Fields he climbed to the top of a mountain , the three of them struggling upwardover stones and through brambles , until at last they could look over the meandering north fork , and the valleys that flanked it . This river , Clark decided , was the one the boats should go up . Searching round him and finding no Indian sign , he turned back down the mountain and presently came to a spring of extremely cold water . Before drinking he splashed water over his head , hands and feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all drank as men halfdeadwith thirst . A little later Clark felt severe cramps across his upper abdomen and down his left side , and by the time he came to Joe Fields andp226Charbonneau , his feet filled with pear thorns and bursting with blisters , he wanted to sit down somewhere alone and not move for a week . Never in his life had he felt so utterly feeble and discouraged . With the pain in his feet and ankles running up the bone to his hip joints and with cramps so convulsing his belly that he could straighten only with an effort of will he led his men across to the middle fork , determined to have a look at it before Lewis could take the boats up the wrong stream . He waded the north fork and found it waist-deep and swift . The clumsy squawman while trying to climb up a slippery hank fell headlong in . Knowing that the simpleton could not swim a stroke , Clark dived in after him , risking his life , and seizing the man 's long black hair , towed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark wanted to go off alone with his misery but he kept marching , for in his mind was a picture of men with swollen feet dragging boats up the wrong river . Lewis and his party meanwhile had come to the first fork , the south or left one ; and leaving his men on the bank he went a halfmileupstream and climbed to the summit of a limestone cliff , for a view of the area . What he saw so impressed him that for ten secondshe did not breathe . Then , sucking air in , he turned again to the east . A great blue range of mountains , snow-topped , was there , running north and south . The range  --  the same range , as far as he could make out in the blue haze  --  swung around in the southwest and then ran east and west . They looked like magnificent mountains , even at so great a distance . Off to his right , in the west , were barren hills slopingdownward from mountains that stood much closer . His gaze then came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet was the south one , a clear beautiful river flowing past the precipice on which he stood . To the right and a few hundred yards south two other rivers , the middle and north forks , formed a junction , and these with the south fork formed the Missouri . It was a wide valley that lay at his feet . In the southeast a wide valley disappeared into blue haze , running far away to the mountains ; and in the northwest was a valley just like it , its twin , with an abutment of high hills between them . So far as he could tell , the north river came out of the south by southwest for ten or fifteen miles and then out of the west , for he thought he could see the dim line of a mountain passage . Clark , he supposed , was somewhere in the mountains on his right , looking over this vast areap227and trying to determine which of the three rivers headed closest to the Columbia . In regard to that , Lewis now had no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southeast and the middle river came down from the south : only the river on his right could come out of the west . And , so far as he could tell , it seemed to be the largest river of the three . Carefully descending over dangerous slide rock , he returned to his men . All eyes were on his face . " I had a fine view of the three forks and the mountains beyond , " he said . " I 'd say the one on the right is the one we 'll go up . " " Does it run fast , Captain ? " " It comes down out of mountains . " " And the mountains get higher and higher , " someone said . " Soon the river 'll be standing on its end and we 'll be climbing straight up waterfalls . " Lewis decided that his men would have to rest a day or two , and so he pitched camp and waited for Clark 's return . Clark staggered in the day after saving the squawman 's life , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fever . The previous night he had slept hardly at all because of chills , and the pains in all his muscles and hones . He had found no Indian sign , he told Lewis , no sign at all . It was pretty barren country as far as he had gone . Lewis was looking at him with alarm . He knew a sick man when he saw one . He knew that Will Clark was a pretty sick man . But Clark tried to wave him away , saying , " I 'm just a little bilious . " Ile stared down at his ankle a moment and added , " To tell the truth , I have n't had a passage for several days . I expect that 's about all that 's wrong with me . " " For several days ! " cried Lewis . " Good God , man ! " " Four days , " Clark said . " Holy Jerusalem ! No wonder you 're sick . " One of the first laws of health with his mother , the yarb doctor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had brought an ample supply of Dr. Rush 's pills , having found them , in his own words , a sovereign remedy for such things as constipation . He took them frequently . He now told Clark that he should take a big dose of them and then soak his feet in hot water . When Clark had four of Dr. Rush 's pills in his stomach and his feet in a kettle of hot water Lewis sat by him and filled his pipe . He looked at his friend , studying his pale face . Both captains knew thatp228if they did not find the Shoshone Indians or some other tribe with horses their journey would end in failure : when they left St. Louis they had thought it would be a portage of only a few miles from the headwaters of one river to the source of the other but now their knowledge of rivers and mountains told them that the distance would be far greater than they had imagined . They had only to look up at these Rockies to realize that . Looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , Lewis decided that he would leave Clark with the boats and go on . He would find the Indians , even if he had to go a hundred miles , even if it took him a month . He would find them or never come back . The next day Clark felt much better and the two captains turned to a pleasant subject : they had three rivers to name and they loved to name rivers . They agreed that it would be highly improper to call either fork the Missouri : that noble river they had followed for twenty-five hundred miles and they would terminate it right here at the forks . For whom should they name these three streams ? " The north one is probably the longest one , " Lewis said . " I propose that we name it in honor of that illustrious person , Thomas Jefferson , who sent us on this great enterprise . " Gravely Clark gave his approval . " All right , that 's the Jefferson River . The middle fork --  " " I propose , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis would name all of them , " I propose that it be named to honor anotherillustrious person . Shall we call it the Madison River ? " " Why , of course ! " said Lewis . He was delighted . " The Jefferson and the Madison . Now the south fork is the smallest one . We named a river for our Secretary of the Navy . We also named one --  " Lewis stopped abruptly . A few days ago he had named one for the Secretaryof War , having forgotten for the moment that the stupid rascal had forced on Clark the humiliation of a lieutenancy instead of a captaincy , a rank he had formerly occupied . Recalling the way Clark 's face had reddened and his eyes turned cold , Lewis broke off , tried to hide his confusion , and then said lamely , " There 's the Secretaryof the Treasury , Albert Gallatin . Is he worth a river ? " Clark said , " Does n't he rank next after the Secretary of State ? " Was there a barb in the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he does . So if you approve --  " " I think it 'll be appropriate , " Clark said . And so the south fork was named the Gallatin.
