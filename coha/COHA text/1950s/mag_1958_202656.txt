The train scraped and groaned to a stop , and out climbed the vanguard of 900 solemn men , women and children , arms laden with bundles , eyes filled with bewilderment and doubt . What they saw gave them no cause for rejoicing : a bleak wilderness surrounded by stern , snowcapped mountains , and in the wilderness a dismal tent city sprawling in the mud under a dour sky . This was the Matanuska Valley , 50 miles northeast of Anchorage , in south-central Alaska . This was the promised land-promised by the wide-eyed Federal Emergency Relief Administration to depression-ridden , red-blooded American families who wanted to leave home and make their way , in fine old American tradition , against the wilderness . This was May 11 , 1935 , a day of heartbreak . <P> By last week the New Deal 's dream valley ( est. pop . 4,000 ) , brimming with prosperity , was Alaska 's biggest farming region . In the 23 years of colonization , Matanuska 's feeble 1,000 acres has grown to about 13,000 acres of cropland worth some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1957 share : $1,854,000 in dairying , potatoes , berries , green vegetables ) . For a total outlay of about $5,400,000 , the Matanuska experiment , says Anchorage Times Publisher Bob Atwood , is " one of the best investments Uncle Sam ever made . " <P> No Ax to Grind . The big success came because a hardy few managed to surmount the follies of the planners . The first settlers-drawn principally from Michigan , Minnesota and Wisconsin-were granted 40 acres apiece , plus 30-year loans ( at 3% ) .

Families received a grindstone , and 20 sacks of coffee beans were sent in , but axes were scarce , and there were no coffee-grinders . <P> Although the colonists were supposed to be farmers hardened to the rigors of northern winters , it was soon clear that many of them had never even been on a farm , let alone sown anything but wild oats .

Slowly , their number dwindled ( 537 left in the first four years ) leaving the strong and the dogged , who bought up the abandoned land . Gradually the birthrate climbed , the bulldozers and the plows and the buildings moved into the wilderness . <P> The big change came in 1938 when the Department of the Interior took over and gave the farmers greater control of their own affairs . Slowly , they began to make the land pay , and by 1940 , when the U.S. began its big Alaskan defense buildup and servicemen created a sudden demand for fresh produce and dairy products , the Matanuskans were on their way .
