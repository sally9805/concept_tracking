On eleven brilliantly lit tracks around the country , some 85,000 Americans gathered each weekday night last week to feast their eyes and bet their dollars on an old-fashioned American pastime all dressed up in modern glare and glitter . They were building this season into the biggest yet in the postwar harness-racing boom . <P> At midseason the sport which even some of its most reverent admirers irreverently call " the trots " is drawing crowds at a rate nearly 10% higher than last year , when 10,500,000 customers flooded into 77 pari-mutuel tracks ( 42 on fairgrounds ) to bet more than half a billion dollars . ( Thoroughbred racing in 1956 attracted 29 million fans who bet $2.2 billion . ) Another 8,000,000 or 9,000,000 harness enthusiasts yearly watch the swaying pacers and busy-gaited trotters at some 337 fairground tracks , where the only betting is undercover . <P> <P> Lobbies at Work . In sentiment the big Midwestern fairs still rate above the city-slicked pari-mutuel tracks , still form the backbone of the Grand Circuit , a series of major meetings that are held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans are likely to jam into the fairgrounds at Du Quoin , Ill. this month to watch the Grand Circuit 's " Kentucky Derby , " the $120,000 Hambletonian . But in practical terms , the sport 's future lies in the ornate pari-mutuel tracks that operate at night near metropolitan areas , making a trip to the races as simple as a trip to the downtown movie house . <P> The big pari-mutuel tracks are still largely confined to the Northeastern and Midwestern U.S. New York State alone accounts for more than half of the fans and the betting totals ( California has only daytime trots , because the motion-picture lobby has successfully opposed night racing ) . But many a state capital has its quota of lobbyists bucking for legalized nighttime racing . <P> Soothed , Stimulated , Served . The gaudiest proof of night trotting 's appeal looms above Long Island 20 miles northeast of Times Square . There one night this week , on the spanking new $21 million Roosevelt Raceway ( capacity : 50,000 ) , some of the best harness drivers will tug on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 105-day meeting . The showplace ( built near the site of the runway that bounced Lindbergh into the air for his 1927 flight to Paris ) is as efficient as a supermarket , as plush as a nightclub . But at every turn the patron will be reminded why-in the management 's opinion-he is there : post time will flicker from a dozen nooks ; even a hotdog stand will flash the odds . Soothed by five acres of gardens , and stimulated by a decorator 's 203 startling hues , the trotting fan will be served by 440 betting windows . <P> " We 're expecting great things out here , " says George Morton Levy , the canny , cigar-smoking chairman of Roosevelt 's executive committee . Levy , once a top-flight lawyer ( one client : Lucky Luciano ) , peers at his business through a rimless pince-nez and finds it thoroughly respectable , though it has been under more than one cloud . <P>
