Credit Weathered the Recession Well <P> AS every schoolboy knows , it was wildly inflated credit that brought on the 1929 crash . When consumer credit rose to a record $44.8 billion at the end of 1957 , many an economist wondered uneasily whether history would repeat itself . Would credit , which had helped speed the postwar boom , bring on and accelerate an economic downturn ? Now that the recession is waning , the answer is in . The credit structure not only surprised the experts but showed strengthening timbers that no one ever suspected it had . <P> As the recession picked up momentum in early ' 58 , the fear was that installment buying would plummet and , with a wave of repossessions by finance companies , pull the economy down farther . Nothing like that occurred . Total U.S. consumer credit ( including installment buying , charge accounts and personal loans ) inched down to $43 billion in July , only 4% below its December high ; installment debt , the biggest hunk of the total , dropped only 2.7% . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The remarkable way in which the U.S. consumer kept up his credit payments despite the recession contributed to economic stability . With a record total of $78.5 billion in savings accounts , he had a fat roll to draw on . With the resources at his command , plus unemployment compensation and other supplementary benefits , he kept up his credit payments while cutting back on new commitments . Says a Los Angeles banker : " The consumer is not as wild an individual as many thought . For the most part , he is serious about satisfying his obligations . " <P> - <P> In areas hard hit by unemployment , repossessions ( especially of autos ) and delinquencies on installment payments naturally rose . But even they were not alarming . In Detroit , businessmen reported a " definite upsurge " in repossessions and mortgage foreclosures . In Worcester , Mass. , where non-farm unemployment reached 10% , loan companies reported repossessions up from a normal .5% to nearly 2% . In Gary , Ind. , dependent on steel , auto repossessions rose from five per 1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. , businessmen reported that repossessions during the recession were " insignificant . " In the Midwest , says Vice President Keith Cone of Chicago 's La Salle National Bank , " the rise in delinquencies and repossessions was just not alarming at all . " By prodding the creditor to be more cautious in his lending and thus weeding out many a weak credit risk , the recession actually im proved collections in some places . Sanger Bros . Department Store in Dallas and one of San Francisco 's biggest department stores reported that collections were better during the recession than before it . Said Emil J. Seliga , president of Chicago 's Talman Federal Savings and Loan Association : " The line of delinquencies this year is no more than the last two years . Sometimes I almost pinched myself because it seemed too good to be true . "
