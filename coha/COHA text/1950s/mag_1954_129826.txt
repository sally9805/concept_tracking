WATKINS GLEN , N.Y . This is a course for brave men , " said that wizard of the wheel , Phil Walters , "  --  and I am not a brave man ! " He had just taken Briggs Cunningham 's 4.5-liter Ferrari on a fast practice session ( 3 min. 9 sees. ) around the 4 ? - mile Watkins Glen , N.Y . road course in preparation for the Seventh Annual Sports Car Grand Prix last Saturday . Brave man or not , Walters  --  despite a long lay-off  --  showed his usual consummate skill by winning the 101-mile main event , in a downpour which threw many of the 24 starters into hectic slides . The hazards facing drivers on this new course also include climbs or downward zooms on 76% of every lap , and a l ? - mile , 130 mph down-hill straight with a curve at the end . Many of the fast cars were airborne for 20 feet at a time as they planed off the humps. // UPSETS AND UNSCHEDULED INCIDENTS // This year 's Watkins Glen races drew an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 177 passed technical inspection . Some 50,000 people formed a huge hedgerow around the course . Numerous upsets on form and some unscheduled incidents intensified the excitement and suspense . An MG lost a wheel at Post No. 3 , injuring a luckless flagman and briefly disrupting telephone communications . A private plane crashed into a barn near the course . The huge , jam-packed grandstand , the blare of the public address system , the leaden light of an invisible sun mingled with those scents and sounds dear to the enthusiast  --  the pungent reek of alcohol , the cloying odors of hot oil and scuffed rubber and the metallic bark of open exhausts. // Walters did not ride the Ferrari in the Grand Prix , but a heavier , slower and less maneuverable Cunningham . Bill Spear , driving his maroon 4.5 Ferrari , jumped into the lead at the outset and with magnificent dash completed the first lap in 3 min. 13.7 secs ,  --  an average of 84 mph from a standing start . Walters , however , stalked him like a shadow , only two seconds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not widen the gap to more than seven seconds . " Gentleman Jim " Kimberly ( 4.5 Ferrari ) lay third , but gradually fell back until on lap 7 he was 41 seconds behind . On lap 11 , Spear unfortunately retired with a stripped rear axle and Walters took the lead , never to relinquish it . Johnston overdid things at the hard right turn into the pit straight and dramatically nosed the big white and blue Cunningham down the escape road , but he got going again without losing third spot to Walt Hansgen 's C-Type Jaguar . Briggs Cunningham ( 4.5 Ferrari ) never showed higher than sixth . Walters completed the 22-lap Grand Prix in 1 hr. 12 min. 46.4 sees. , an average of 83.3 mph . Kimberly averaged 81.4 mph and Johnston 81.3 mph ; but to Spear went the honor of the fastest lap ( his eighth ) at 86.6 mph. // A TEMPERAMENTAL PORSCHE // Four shorter events preceding the Grand Prix packed the day with some spectacular racing . In the Seneca Cup ( 11 laps , 50.6 miles for unrestricted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among 34 starters was Gordon " Tippy " Lipe whose temperamental , supercharged Porsche-Cooper can outaccelerate almost anything . Lipe got clean away from the field for two laps , pursued by Phil Cade in a veteran Maserati , and by that phlegmatic sportsman , Dr. M. R. J. Wyllie with a C-Type Jaguar . However , the Cooper- Porsche lost its verve after two laps and quit on the fourth . Wyllie took the lead on lap 3 and held it to the checkered flag . Paul Timmins was second in his Hansgen-Jaguar Special , and Alan Patterson II placed third with an Allard . Wyllie averaged 76.2 mph. // The Collier Brothers Memorial Trophy ( same distance but for stock MGs only ) saw another upset when Gus Ehrman ( TD MG ) beat favorite Ralph Durbin ( TF MG ) by a few yards after a terrific battle . Bill Long was third in another TF MG . Ehrman averaged 61.2 mph ; Durbin 61.1 mph . There were 36 starters and the three leaders traded places six times . // The Glen Trophy , also of 51.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought 54 entries and again tossed the odds overboard . Charles " Chuck " Wallace with an unbroken string of 12 victories in Jaguar races this season was cinched to win overall , yet he never ran better than sixth due to a faulty brake pedal . Max Goldman and Dick Thompson were an even bet in the Porsche class , but both had trouble  --  Goldman being hit by another car and Thompson losing a piston . Bill Kincheloe Jr. , Austin-Healey trump card , spun out when his overdrive control failed . Dick Perrin ( Jaguar ) took the overall checker at 73.6 mph ; George Constantine and Warren Smith , both in Jaguars , were second and third . Bob Magenheimer won the Porsche class , with Thompson limping home second and Warren Steel in third . Britisher Roy Jackson-Moore headed the Austin-Healey class and Jim Robinson earned the laurels for the Triumph contingent . // LIKE OLD TIMES // The 34 starters for the Queen Catharine Cup ( 16 laps , 73.6 miles , for modified sports cars under 1,500 cc ) included no less than eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first three overall places . Frank Bott led all the way at 78.5 mph , followed by John Gordon Bennett ( 77.8 mph ) and Phil Stewart ( 75 mph ) . Rees Makins , however , whose 1,100 Osca has scooped every Class G event this season , broke his winning streak . A flat tire cost him two laps in the pit , but he still managed a third behind Tony Pompeo in my Siata . Bob Keller ( Siata ) was first home . Marshall Lewis , driving Briggs Cunningham 's new Stanguellini , not only ran away with the 750 cc class but finished sixth overall  --  an amazing performance . // It was like old times again at Watkins Glen .
