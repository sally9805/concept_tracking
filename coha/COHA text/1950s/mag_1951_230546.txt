This ten-year-old baseball captain had the same problem that plagued many of his elders : he needed a good lefthand pitcher , a hot infielder and a power hitter . In Denver , or anywhere else , such a trio is hard to find . But suddenly the captain 's furrowed brow unfurrowed , and he snapped his fingers . His neighbor , " Al " Hessel , aged 9 , could pitch , field and bat with the best of his teammates . Al was the triple threat he was looking for . There was only one drawback : Al was a girl . <P> There was nothing in the league rules against girls playing , but tradition was against it , and little boys are terrible traditionalists . In her first appearance , they teased her with : " Hey , Al , watch your pigtails . " The growls changed to grins and cheers when Al pitched ( all three innings ) and won the game , 11-0 . Said Alice afterwards , with conscious but nonchalant pride : " I made all the outs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One kid hit a grounder , and I fielded it and threw to first . I guess I do all right at fielding , too . " <P> Now Alice is accepted as one of the boys , even by the opposition : " They do n't razz me much any more . When I started fogging my fast ball in there , they quit . " And she is doing all right at bat : she has whacked three home runs in nine games , and her current batting average is .700 . Last week , Alice emulated her idol , Bob Feller , by pitching a no-hitter . Southpaw Alice , whose opinion of her teammates ' ability is not high ( " Our shortstop ca n't catch the ball , and our catcher 's terrible , too . . . The boys should practice more " ) , did it the hard way . She struck out every batter .
