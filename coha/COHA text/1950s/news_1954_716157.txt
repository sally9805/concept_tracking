txt FO ROOM F013. 3E .. A.T.A.M.Y SIVE It seems only yesterday when to raise the question of what should be done in the case of a business recession was to divide a majority of the adult population into two reciprocally hostile and irreconcilable camps . In one camp would be found those diehards who advocated a policy of " letting nature run its course . " The other would be comprised , in the main , of those who were convinced that the country 's salvation lay in a Government program of public works . How far we have come since those days is refreshingly and hopefully evident in the study just released by the Committee for Economic Development entitled " Defense Against Recession : A Policy for Greater Economic Stability . " This study has been two years in preparation and the report is a document of fifty-fout pages . But of those fifty-four pages less than one full page is devoted to the one-time " specific " of Government spending .

At any rate , one will peruse the pages of the report in vain for any reference to it . - It should perhaps be interjected here that one obvious reason why these two old-fashioned remedies play a minimum role , or no role . at all , in the general conclusions of the C. E. D. is that the national economy has not only expanded enormously since their heyday but has changed its pattern land either developed or been provided withbuilt-in weapons of defense unknown a generation ago . Today , it is recognized that combating a recesZion calls for.the coordinate ( Pefforts of - all elements in the economy , includingthe-Government , business and the . consumer .

By contrast , the higher level at which taxes ? stand compared . with those earlier years gives us a lever that could be used effectively and quickly should conditions require it . The committee report is not , as its authors point out , a blueprint for action , but rather a long-range appraisal of the country 's ability to resist and ; recover from economic declines . Its central conclusion is that " Our economy can achieve its high potential without violent fluctuations . " Confidence in this conclusion rests on many facts  --  facts such as " the strengthening of our financial and economic structure , the longerterm perspective of business planning , the stabilizing influence of unemployment compensation and income taxation , the other powerful instruments now available and the improved understanding of their use .
