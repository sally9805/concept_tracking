txt Old Colony passenger service resumed this morning , as promised yesterday afternoon by George Alpert , president of the line 's parent body , the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad . But the big question remains : For how long ? Like one of those new-fangled art forms , the mobile , the Old Colony question is a thing of many parts . Each of these parts hangs in delicate balance and relationship with the other by a fragile and flexible link . Interfere with one of these links and the free motion of the parts is hampered . Break one and the whole shebang is likely to come crashing down . According to yesterday 's agreement with Mr. Alpert , arrived at after a day-long session between officials of the Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce , the Boston Real Estate Board , and , by telephone and telegram , Governor Furcolo and top-ranking legislators , the Old Colony is temporarily back in the running . Precedent Sighted Mr. Alpert left no doubt in his statement that emphasis is on the . word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill to provide a " public service payment " of $000,000 , while passed by the Senate by a slender 19-17 margin , is laid on the table , awaiting an opinion by the state Supreme Court as to its constitutionality . Temporary , because some doubt exists that the bill in its present form should ever ha ? . a begun in the Senate at all , because some senators see it as a " money bill , " which must by law originate in the House of Representatives . The Supreme Court will also give its opinion on this matter within the next few days . Temporary , because even if passed by the Senate , the bill is subject to sharp scrutiny by the House . A large number of representatives from western ? and northern parts of Massachusetts foresee the day when the Boston &; Albany and Boston . &; Maine Railroads will ask " " public service payments " to stay in business . Problem Continues Temporary , because the Boston City Council is in profound disagreement with Mayor Hynes over the logic , the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would force Boston to pay $225,000 of the total $900,000 " public service payment ' ' ? which the councilors argue is service that Boston is not getting . And temporary , finally , in its over-all aspect , because the bill is admittedly a stopgap measure that will at best extend the life of the Old Colony only until July 1 , 1959 , at which time the commonwealth will have to face the realities of the transportation problem which legislators , civic groups , university studies , and newspaper editorials have been emphasizing for 10 years is a statewide , even nationwide , problem , and not a local phenomenon on the South Shore . Isolating from these considerations yesterday 's ill-coordi-nated negotiations which brought about the temporary restoration of service for an estimated 10,000 commuters to the South Shore , the accomplishment was a remarkable one . ! Patience Noted It was brought about in the face of shortening tempers and misunderstandings by the patient persistence of those who spent a trying day in the offices of Mr. Alpert and the New Haven directors . I Representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subsidy plan , were Thomas M. Hennes ; sey , chairman of the chamber board ; John A. Volpe , president ; ; William J. Bird , executive vice ; president ; and Daniel J. Ahern , manager of the metropolitan affairs department . On the far end of the discussion , by telephone and telegraph , were Governor Furcolo ; Senator John E. Powers ( D ) of Boston , Senator minority leader ; Senator Newland H. Holmes ( R ) of Weymouth , President ; and Representative John F. Thompson ( D ) of Ludlow , Speaker of the House , among others . Despite a badly timed telegram from Governor Furcolo that blasted the New Haven 's curtailment of Old Colony service on Wednesday as an act of " bad faith , " and nearly blasted all chances of agreement , the situation was smoothed over . Both the Governor and legislators agreed to include two amendments in the bill , demanded by Mr. Alpert . The major amendment desired by the New Haven was clarification that the $900,000 to be paid the road will be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not applicable as a down payment on the salvage price of the Old Colony , on which Massachusetts holds an option . Also commuting to New York yesterday were Mayor Hynes and three members or past members of the Boston Real Estate Board ; Francis W. Perry , immediate past president ; H. Kingsley Durant , another former president ; and Walter K. Winchester , assistant executive vice-president .
