Low 's AUTOBIOGRAPHY ( 387 pp. ) - David Low-Simon &; Schuster ( $5 ) . <P> <P> David Low , perhaps the most famed political cartoonist of modern times , worked over the faces of the great with a wooden matchstick dipped in India ink . For his own self-portrait he has chosen pastels . <P> The exhibits in Low 's human menagerie - scowling , smirking , always true to life , yet slightly absurd-have stayed in the minds of millions . Apart from talent , all great cartoonists need a point of attack from which to enfilade their natural and necessary enemy-the great . Low 's point of attack was his own New Zealand background . His Scottish-born father was one of those lovable Victorian cranks-a promoter of religions and patent medicines , and a man who fostered domestic harmony by encouraging intellectual debate . In the raucous , blasphemous , antitraditional political life of New Zealand and Australia , Low found his style , starting at eleven as a cartoonist for dim but gallant little periodicals , then graduating to the rambunctious Sydney Bulletin . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to draw a horse he had to see a horse . When he needed a steam roller as a cartoon symbol , the city council obligingly had one driven under the windows of his studio . An admirer also presented him with a stuffed lion . Low gave it away later , having already decided that the " Olympian pet-shop " of national symbols was not good enough for a real cartoonist . <P> Licensed Jester . By the time Low was ready for London in 1919 , he had whittled the heavy chip on his provincial , radical , colonial shoulder into quite a weapon . He knew how to de-stuff shirts , e.g. , he recalls that Austen Chamberlain , Britain 's Foreign Secretary in the ' 20s , could not read very well through his celebrated monocle ; that Stanley Baldwin , famed for his pipe-puffing , " probably smoked cigarettes in private . " <P> The best thing in the book is Low 's shoptalk , e.g. , his irritation with Churchill because a pink-and-sandy man can not be properly rendered in black and white . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature , the theatrical reminiscence . His pride rings out most clearly when he recounts how heads of state sent emissaries to his studio to ask for originals of his caricatures to decorate the walls of their vanity . This may help explain how the boy radical became a sort of licensed jester at the court of his political enemies . Even " Colonel Blimp , " Low 's greatest gift to the popular mythology of politics , somehow went wrong . They made a film about Blimp , and it turned into a defense of all the stuffy traditions Low had spent his life deriding .
