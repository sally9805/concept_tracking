The Christian Hope <P> Sir : <P> Thank you for the superb report Sept. 6 on Evanston . . . Your summary highlights much of that digestible bread of life which can nourish us all and strengthen hope in very practical respects . Thank God for the outcome and promise of the second World Assembly . <P> <P> ( THE REV . ) PHILIP WALBORN The Presbytery of Spokane Reardan , Wash . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Congratulations on your excellent cover story on the Evanston World Council Assembly and the Archbishop of Canterbury . . . Few men so well epitomize in their own persons the ideals and spirit of ecumenical Christianity , and none moved more helpfully through the Evanston Assembly . But TIME 'S stated reason for its choice-that " the worldwide Anglican Communion is the exemplary ecumenical church " - is not wholly convincing . If what TIME means is that the Anglican Communion embraces extremes in doctrine , polity and politics , that is a fact . . . On the other hand , if TIME is echoing the claim , so dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providentially destined role as the focal point of Christian Unity-a " bridge-church " which shall ultimately unite traditional Catholicism , whether Roman or Eastern , and the varieties of Protestantism-this whole contention requires " existential " scrutiny . . . <P> If we think of the major Christian Communions as arranged along a line , somewhat like parties in a legislature , from right to left according to their proximity to , or distance from , traditional Catholicism , the " right " embraces in turn the orthodox churches : Anglicanism , Lutheranism and Presbyterianism . Proceeding from the opposite end of the line at the extreme " left , " we find the Friends , the Baptists , the Disciples of Christ , the Congregationalists , other smaller bodies sprung from the " radical Reformation , " and the Methodists ; these account for well over 40% of the World Council 's membership . In the center , uniting within their membership churches of both " right " and " left , " stand a whole group of " united " churches-the United Church of Canada , the Church of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the United Church of North India , the Church of South India , and others . They are at the center of gravity , the fulcrum , of ecumenical Christianity . . . <P> <P> HENRY P. VAN DUSEN Sorrento , Me . <P> <P> Sir : <P> . . . The ecumenical movement is an unscriptural dream of a papal protestantism and regimented Christianity . It strives for union at the cost of unity . . . <P> <P> MEROLD E. WESTPHAL Pastor <P> Independent Presbyterian Church Greensboro , N. C. <P> <P> Sir :
