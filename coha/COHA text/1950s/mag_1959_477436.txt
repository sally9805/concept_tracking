They did n't mean to do it , but a handful of American storekeepers are causing a profound upheaval in Latin America ? creating a new middle class , new jobs , and new power for the once-scorned little customers . A NEW kind of revolution is taking place in Latin America . Without bloodshed or headlines , this one is peaceful , gradual . and profound in its effects . The Consumers Revolution , to give it a name , is making over the lives of millions of ordinary people throughout the vast continent south of the Rio Grande . For the United States , it means a wholly new element in our dealings with Latin America . The Consumers Revolution in Latin America originated , logically enough . in the land where the consumer is king : the United States . It was sparked by an American enterprise whose success is due precisely to its irresistible consumer appeal : Sears , Roebuck and Company . Sears played the role of revolutionary quite unwittingly ? in the beginning at any rate . But the social by-products of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by any big-name official mission we have sent south in recent years ; for the impact of even the best official mission comes from above , whilethat of Sears is from below , where it counts for most . Other foreign companies operating in Latin America have had close contact with the people , but too often it has been of the master-servant kind . In Sears ' case we have for the first time a giant United States corporation meeting masses of Latin Americans day in and day out on a plane of equality ? if not actually reversing the old roles and making the Latino boss , since in an American store the customer is always right . A BEACHHEAD IN HAVANA SIXTEEN years ago the Chicago mail-order house with the famous catalogue of bargains for the whole family decided to enter the foreign field . Its reasons for selecting Latin America first were entirely businesslike . Latin America is our next-door neighbor and the chances of making money there seemed good ; certainty Sears had no notions of launching a revolution . If its decision had any human-interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , General Robert E. Wood , had occasionally vacationed in Mexico and had taken a shine to the country . When a cousin of his became a successful real-estate operator in Mexico City , the idea occurred to Wood that it might pay to set up a store there some day . But Sears opened its first Latin American store in Havana , Cuba , instead . That was in November 1942. 66 SEARS , ROEBUCK 'S MEXICAN REVOLUTION The Havana store was largely experimental . It was n't until after World War II , in 1947 , that Sears " invaded " Latin America in earnest . It then opened , in Mexico , its first Latin American " A " store . ( An " A " store is the highest of seven categories of stores in the Sears chain . ) With that , the Consumers Revolution got off the ground . In the short period since 1947 , Sears has branched out from two stores in Cuba and Mexico to 55 stores and 13 sales offices in nine Latin American republics : Brazil , Colombia , Costa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Peru , and Venezuela ; these countries contain two-thirds of Latin America 's population . Starting with a handful of employees , Sears now employs an army of 10,000 , nearly all of them natives . Sales which totaled about $15 million annually a decade ago have shot up to more than $100 million ? a staggering sum considering the poverty that prevails in Latin America and the fact that many of its inhabitants still live outside the money economy . Sears sparked the Consumers Revolution and continues to be a major stimulus , but what we must try to measure is not the company 's achievements per se but the chain reaction they started . The American merchandising practices which Sears introduced have been the catalyst of a revolution affecting the entire Latin American buying public . We are not attempting here to evaluate Sears , Roebuck and Company as a company , nor even its foreign division , which operates its Latin American stores . Whether Sears as a corporation is - good " or " bad , " who runs it , who owns stock in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other matters ; what we are ? concerned with here is one thing alone : Sears ' impact upon the Latin American consumer . And that impact , as we shall see , has generally been highly beneficial . FOR THE CARRIAGE TRADE ONLY T HERE is no secret formula in Sears ' success in Mexico , nor in the changes which it has brought to the country . Wilbur E. Plummer , president of Sears , Roebuck de Mexico , S.A. , the company 's Mexican subsidiary , told me the story of how the company revolutionized the retail business there . At forty-seven , Plummer is a veteran of twenty-five years ' service and has worked his way up from the bottom . Until the postwar period , the retail business in Mexico ( and Latin America ) was small and backward , because people never had enough money to buy the things they needed . A great many Mexicans continued to receive wages in kind , as they had under the feudalistic hacienda ( large estate ) system , long after it was overthrown by the Revolution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went all-out to industrialize the country , chiefly by offering new industries tax exemptions and similar inducements , and for the first time large numbers of Mexicans received money-wages and had cash to spend . The stage was set for someone like Sears to show them how to spend their money and get the most for it . Why Sears ? Why not a native company ? The answer is that Mexican department stores lived in the past and had Tin idea of modern merchandising . The biggest ones ? Palacio de Hierro , Casa Armand , Francia Maritima ? had been founded by Frenchmen back in the pre-1910 hacienda epoch of the old dictator , Porfirio Diaz . Encouraged by Diaz ' French-descended Minister of Finance , Jose Ives Lirnantour , department stores had a distinctly French air and catered to the carriage trade . They had iron-grilled balconies rising in tiers like nineteenth-century opera boxes , and their merchandising policies were of the same vintage . A Mexican entering a French-style department store would be treated with near-disdain , unless he belonged to one of the best families . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and variety was limited . Sales personnel were inefficient and unschooled . Business volume , as a result , was small and only the higher-income groups could afford to dress themselves and furnish their homes well . When the average Mexican did begin to acquire the cash to qualify him as a department-store customer , he took his money to the inadequate specialty shops and street markets ( where he has traditionally shopped or bartered ) . At this point , enter Sears . Sears inaugurated its first Latin American " A " store , built around the old American school building on Mexico City 's Avenida Insurgentes , on February 27 , 1947 . For two months before opening clay Scars staged the biggest and most effective publicity campaign ever seen in Mexico and had people saying , " They 're practically going to give things away . " Yet so pervasive was the thinking of the old French-style establishments that even Sears , notwithstanding its modern outlook and its traditional orientation toward the mass market , estimated that its appeal would be essentially to the upper crust . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishment , people flocked to the Insurgences opening in such multitudes that store personnel and police together were unable to cope with them . Sales were small in volume that day , but word-of-mouth publicity large . The old Mexican department stores began to ask themselves : " What is drawing everybody to Sean ? " ' The answer was soon obvious : display , marking , quality , and prices . Merchandise was laid out attractively in orderly stacks on open counters , where the customer could see and touch it for himself . Every item sold was accurately and fully described and , above all , its quality was guaranteed . The American shopper takes it for granted that , say , a dress marked 100 per cent cotton ( or wool , as the case may be ) , is just that ; but in Latin countries the customer used to be told that the dress contained 100 per cent cotton ( or wool ) although it may have been 50 per cent rayon . When the Mexican public discovered that Sears openly marked an article " 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good as the " 100 per cent pure " merchandise and cheaper besides . people jammed the American store . The Gallicized establishments , fearing the loss of business , were forced to adopt the newcomer 's practices . NOT A CENTAVO MORE N. E X T , Wilbur Plummer relates , " Sears inaugurated a very definite revolution in price policy . Before we came , customers were told the price of an item verbally and goods were not ticketed . Now Mexican department stores ticket their goods . " Anyone who has traveled in Latin America knows that when you go into a shop , or a street market , you are expected to haggle over the quoted price ; this is because the quoted price is usually inflated and everybody knows it . So it was , also , in the department stores . Often as not , an article would have as many different prices as there were prospective purchasers . A good bargainer could argue the price down , but generally the store could hang onto a high mark-up . Nowadays when you walk around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked on all goods , and that is what you pay ? not a centavo more . This delights the ordinary shopper , who is now able to calculate how much he or she can afford to spend and exactly what value his pesos will bring . Along with the one-price policy , Sears also introduced the moderate-price policy . Its prices in the beginning , however , as noted above , were higher than the average , not only because it oriented itself to the upper-income group but also because it had to import everything from the United States and costs were correspondingly high . But when Sears discovered that its novel practices were attracting people of all classes , it concluded that it would pay to supply them with goods made in Mexico and bring prices down . This it has succeeded in doing . Some items , like refrigerators , which arc still manufactured in relatively small quantities in Mexico , fetch higher prices than in the United States ; but generally the merchandise sold by Sears de Mexico is priced well within the pocketbooks of a majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and better-class Sears stores , like the one on Mexico City 's Avenida Ejercito Nacional which caters to the fashionable Lomas and Polanco districts , prices arc reasonable . In that store children 's coats last . winter cost as little as 169 pesos ( $13.52 ) ; women 's skirts , 119 pesos ( 59.52 ) ; men 's fancy sports shim , 69.95 pesos ( $5.60 ) ; boys ' Roy Rogers cowboy Shirts , 29.95 pesos ( $2.40 ) . And in the store 's excellent restaurant , the hungry shopper can get a lull-course steak lunch for only 15 pesos ( $1.20 ) . Who is the average shopper in Mexico today ? Sears " is certainly reaching into the middle classes , " according to a survey published by the National Planning Association in 1953 . Today , nearly six years later , I can report that Sears is certainly reaching into the working classes as well . The Ejercito Nacional store , for 68 SEARS , ROEBUCK 'S MEXICAN REVOLUTION example , notwithstanding its location in a high-class residential district , draws customers from outlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the Sears trend , attract a large number of low-paid workers ? though of course many Mexicans , especially in the small towns and rural areas , have yet to see the inside of a department store , Sears or any other . RIVETS TO RAINCOATS S EARS , moreover , is playing a vital role in the formation of the Mexican middle class ? a new phenomenon decisive to the stability and progress of Mexico . " It is not just money that makes a middle class , " as the NPA study cogently observes , " but rather goods , especially durables .... " " Durables " like household furnishings and appliances have become available in mass quantities , for the first time in Mexico . Glance into the Mexican middle-class home and you will see the Consumers Revolution in tangible objects . Instead of the leaky old icebox that was there a decade ago , an electric refrigerator gleams in the kitchen ; the ancient cement washtub has been replaced by an automatic washing machine ; and the old clay oven or coal stove has given way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also find a formica-topped table , a blending machine , and other electric gadgets in the kitchen ; a television set and foam-rubber chairs in the living-room ; a handsome suite in Swedish modern style in the bedroom . Out in the garage ( the Mexican middle class travels on wheels ) , the man of the house may even have a bench stacked with tools purchased at Sears or some rival native department store . The Consumers Revolution appears on the streets as well . Wherever the visitor goes in Latin America ? in the cities , at any rate ? he is likely 10 encounter surprising numbers of latinos wearing good and stylish clothes : stenographers turning up at the office in fashionable dresses , executives hurrying to lunch in three-button single-breasteds , children playing outside the house in dungarees and sneakers . ( In contrast , in 1917 , fully 98 per cent of the residents of Mexico City went barefoot ? now only 2 per cent have no shoes . ) To be sure they wear clothes that are American in style , in preference to European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ native department stores as well as at Sears . For the Consumers Revolution is not a foreign import . Though an American company was the catalytic agent , the products arc home-made . With few exceptions these clothes and household goods are made by the Latins themselves out of their own materials and in their own plants and factories . ( Paradoxically , the revolution , while popularizing American styling , is also reviving many purely indigenous crafts like ceramics . ) When Sears opened in Mexico , it had to import everything it sold . The " French " stores had apparently never dreamed of trying to build up local sources of supply . Encouraged , however , by the overwhelming response of the Mexicans , Sears concluded that if it was going to do a volume business it would pay to buy everything it could right on the spot . All well and good , but where were the plants which could turn out the countless thousands of different items , from rivets to raincoats , which Sears stocked ? Mexican consumer-goods production had hardly advanced beyond the cottage-industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plants and Mexico led most of Latin America in capital-goods production , articles for retail trade were still made either in private dwellings by hand or in tiny " factories " with one or two machines . Most Mexicans wore clothes made to order by seamstresses or tailors working in their homes . Sears realized it had to create its own suppliers . Starting with the cottage producers , it would find someone who owned a machine or two , lend him money to buy more machines and hire more workers , and give him enough orders to assure him a steady flow of work ? and Sears a steady flow of goods . To insure quality , Sears sent around technicians to check and advise . One clothing manufacturer , for example , started with only two machines and went to eighteen in half-a-dozen years . A furniture-maker who employed only four workers jumped to sixty . The biggest producer of stoves in Mexico , Acros , achieved that position with the help of Sears , increasing its labor force from forty to four hundred . In addition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of its Chi ? cago laboratories to improve its stove design , even though 80 per cent of Acros ' production goes to other outlets . In a few important instances , Sears has found it necessary to go into the supply end of retailing itself in order to insure a regular output of certain products . Thus it bought a 50 per cent interest in a factory making men 's work clothes , and the same interest in another pro- clueing sports shirts ; this resulted in doubling the production of both . Sears also owns 15 per cent of a plant which manufacturers household appliances , and brought into being two completely new supply houses , one making TV and radio sets and the other wheel goods . Generally , though , Sears relies upon others to make what it needs . It does business with a grand total of 2,000 independent Mexican suppliers , large and small , all of whom it has aided in various ways . Many of them it put into business while others it enabled to expand . From these suppliers , Sears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . THOUSANDS OF J0135 AND CASH IN POCKET T H E impact of Sears upon Mexican industry ( and upon industry elsewhere in Latin America where it has stores ) goes far beyond the 2,000 suppliers it deals with . The influence of Sears on the Mexican economy is at least fourfold . ( 1 ) In the first place , as we have shown , Mexico today has a modern consumer-goods industry because of Sears . ( 2 ) Mexico 's industrial production as a whole ? including capital goods ? has developed under Sears ' stimulus . Its role in this respect is comparable to that of the great New England merchants of the early eighteenth century who did so much to stimulate American industrialization . " Due to the more than 40,000 stock units we carry , our influence has reached into more industries and more product development than that of any other company , " Plummer claims . Mexico now has a plant that manufactures textile machinery ; industries making proc essed items such as rayon tire cord , paint , plastics , and glass ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and zinc . And Sears ' demand has even reached into key industries like transportation and oil . ( 3 ) Labor , too , participates in the Consumers Revolution . To begin with , in the industries which feed the insatiable consumers market a new corps of workers has grown up , with new skills ? and money to spend in their pockets . Sears itself employs 3,560 workers in Mexico alone , only twenty-two of whom are non-Mexicans . The great majority of its Mexican employees have been thoroughly trained in modern merchandising and constitute a very highly skilled force . They are , moreover , well paid by Latin American standards . Wages at Sears , for example , range from 800 pesos ( $64 ) to 6,500 pesos ( $520 ) a month for sales and technical employees , who form the overwhelming majority of the company 's staff . The peso brings far more in Mexico than its equivalent in American currency , eight cents , brings in the United States ; to make a realistic if rough comparison , a Sears employee earning a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the scale of an American earning the equivalent , $240 , but rather of one earning somewhere between $500 and $750 . Besides , almost every Sears employee belongs to the company 's Savings and Profit Sharing Fund , and receives such benefits as paid vacations , free medical treatment , luncheons at cost ( averaging about 30 cents each ) , and a discount on purchases . Allowing for local variations , what is true of Sears ' Mexican employees is true of most of the 10,000 persons it employs in Latin America , and even , in varying degrees , of innumerable thousands more who work for the native department stores which follow Sears ' practices . ( 4 ) Out of this white-collar elite is emerging a type of leader new to Latin America , and one destined to play a vital role in the area 's general development : the department-store executive . The future of Sears , for one , as Plummer frankly acknowledges , depends in the final analysis upon its Mexican personnel and , in particular , upon its Mexican executives . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every kind of training they can possibly absorb , including experience in the parent organization in the U. S. The moment they qualify for top posts , they are upgraded . Apart from all else , psychologically this is of immeasurable importance as it means that for a change the Latins , who have historically been looked down upon by the more advanced nations ? especially by ours ? as " lazy , " " inefficient , " and " unbusinesslike , " are treated on the job as equals . All but a handful of Sears de Mexico 's top positions are filled by Mexicans . Of its twenty stores and sales offices Mexicans manage sixteen . They also fill just about every executive job below manager ? assistant managers , credit managers , division managers , and auditors . The president of Sears de Mexico , Wilbur Plummer , is one of a very few non-Mexican executives in the entire organization , and he looks forward to the clay when a Mexican will fill his shoes . Typical of many young Mexicans qualified for the top jobs ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? is young Jorge Lemus . YOUNG MAN ON THE MAKE T H R E E help-wanted ads which Sears inserted in Mexico City newspapers before the first Mexican store opened brought 15,000 replies . Among them was Jorge Lemus ' application . One of the lucky few , he was hired two months before the store opened . His job : checker . His pay : 400 pesos ( then worth about 346 ) a month . Neither this job nor this pay was what Lemus , an educated and intelligent young man , wanted or was accustomed to . He had , as a matter of fact , left a better position to join Sears . " 1 decided , " he explained , " to take a chance on Sears ' future in Mexico . " The gamble , he is first to admit , has paid off handsomely . Lemus did n't remain a checker long . " I was determined to go up quickly " ? and he did . In four months he was a warehouse manager . in six more an assistant Customers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager . That put him in the executive category . From there he went to floor manager , to superintendent of operations , then in 1952 , to manager of his first store , in Puebla . Five years later he was appointed head of the newest Sears store in Latin America , the one at Ejercito Nacional , and became the first Latin ever to manage a Sears " A " store . At thirty-nine , Jorge Lemus is sitting pretty . He oversees an enterprise that occupies an area of 200,000 square feet , normally carries an inventory valued at 13 to 14 million pesos ( more than a milli ( It dollars ) , and employs 400 persons ? as tidy a business empire as any ambitious young American executive could wish to administer . He earns about 170,000 pesos a year ( $13,600 in U. S. currency , but worth much more in Mexican purchasing power ) . He lives in a comfortable house in a middle-class residential district with his wife and their four children . By the time he is fifty , Lemus can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mexican standards ) which will then be due him from the Profit Sharing Fund . Above all , Lemus and the thousands like him all over Latin America are , for all practical purposes , running the Consumers Revolution ? a source of pride and satisfaction which money alone can not be . The revolution , in turn , depends upon them , for they are a guarantee that it will continue its present course and that the policies and innovations introduced by Sears in Latin America will go on : a mass market , a consumer-goods industry , plenty of quality merchandise , a system of honest and reasonable pricing ? and a wholesome respect for the customer . Sears has taught so well that it is now in the ironic position of the master whose disciple threatens to surpass him . Thus , what is by far the most modern and best-appointed store in Mexico , if not in all Latin America , has recently been opened , not by Seats , but by the native Palacio de Hierro . Only yesterday , Palacio de Hierro was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a giant Ieap from the 1890s to the 1950s , it is challenging Sears , its mentor , for leadership over the Mexican retail business . This is all to the good , for only native leaders can ultimately carry the benefits of the Consumers Revolution to all of Latin America 's fast-growing population . Sears has proved to be the most effective ambassador the United States has sent abroad in many a year .
