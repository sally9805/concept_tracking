The U.S. Congress lurched toward adjournment last week , and accomplished precious little on the way . Particularly in the House was there stumbling and indecision and downright irresponsibility . The sorry show reached its climax as the House killed a badly needed national highway construction program . <P> Ditching the Roads . First , by a 221-to-193 vote , the House defeated the Eisenhower Administration 's road-building program , which called for financing the work over the next 30 years by a $21 billion special bond issue ( " Bonds for Boulevards , " scoffed congressional Democrats ) . Then the House turned to the plan sponsored by its own Democratic leadership , under which $24 billion would have been spent in 13 years , financed by road-tax increases , on gasoline , diesel fuel , truck tires , etc . Against this bill stood the American Trucking Associations , Inc. and its network of state organizations . The A.T.A. threw only three lobbyists into the fight on Capitol Hill , but its state units had alerted individual trucking lines , large and small . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the House Public Works Committee , which handled the bill , got 5,000 wires ) . <P> Under such pressure the House collapsed , ditched the road bill 292 to 123 . Democratic Floor Leader John McCormack charged out of the chamber sputtering to newsmen : " Everybody wants a road bill , but nobody wants to pay for it . " <P> Working late Saturday night , the House made a show of efficiency by passing 260 bills in a single day . But most of them were private bills , of little significance to anyone but their legislative sponsors and select groups of constituents . Among the measures that might otherwise have been important the House action often came too late to have much current meaning , e.g. , the House held up the natural gas regulation bill for months , then passed it at the last moment by a six-vote margin . Then the House leadership was indignant because the Senate decided it had not received the bill in time to act on it this year ( Speaker Sam Rayburn kept sending angry little notes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Housing . Despite its stumbling , the Congress might have been able to adjourn last week had it not been for differences between the House and the Senate on the issue of public housing . Early in June the Senate passed a bill calling for up to 135,000 public housing starts during each of the next four years . Late last week the House finally got around to acting ; it passed a bill that in effect offered no public housing at all . The two versions went to a House-Senate conference committee , which went to work down in the old Supreme Court chamber . <P> Before it could adjourn , the Congress had to receive and act upon a report from the conference committee-and the committee was deadlocked . ( Said New York 's Republican Senator Irving Ives : " We did n't come within gunshot of each other . " ) That being the case , there was nothing to do but stay in Washington over the weekend and try again this week . <P> This week , as its record was added up ( see box ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some accomplishments , but it had also compiled a considerable list of wretched failures .
