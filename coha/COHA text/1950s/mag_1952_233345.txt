By the time the votes were counted in California 's Republican primary last week , two political road signs were clear : Governor Earl Warren 's fortunes are going down , Senator William Knowland 's are going up . But no one could be entirely sure where California 's 70 important delegates to the Republican National Convention will go . <P> Earl Warren , who did not do well with his primary forays in Wisconsin and Oregon , ran into trouble in his own state . He won the presidential-preference vote and California 's 70 delegates , but he did not win handily ; a slate with nothing to offer except opposition to Warren got more than half a million votes . The anti-Warren slate 's in-name-only candidate for President was Representative Thomas H. Werdel of Bakersfield . His chief cry : Warren is not really a candidate for President , but wants to deal for a place in a national Republican administration . <P> Ten Years of Enemies . The political enemies that Warren had made in nearly ten years as governor-Republicans who do n't like his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposals , oilmen who oppose his state gasoline tax-lined up behind Werdel who had lots of money to spend on the campaign . California observers who understand what Warren was up against consider that he did well to poll 997,609 votes against Werdel 's 509,205 . But outside the state , what will register is the size of the vote against Warren . <P> Inevitably , the Warren-Werdel contest was compared with the startling performance of Warren 's political protege , 43-year-old Senator William Knowland . In the Republican senatorial primary , Knowland rolled up a total of 1,499,290 votes to 185,827 for two opponents . Under California 's weird cross-filing system , Knowland also won the Democratic primary , is thus fully assured of re-election in November . Knowland 's total vote , 2,450,435 , was more than any other political candidate ever got in California primaries . <P> With these results to consider , politicians began to revise their thinking about California . Earl Warren has dim prospects as a compromise candidate in a situation that seems more &; more to be a straight Ike-Taft contest . California 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bark &; grain of vice-presidential timber. * <P> Assistant publisher of his father 's Oakland daily Tribune and an ex-state senator , Knowland was appointed to the Senate by Warren in August 1945 , while he was still serving as an Army major in Paris . Named to the seat vacated by Hiram Johnson 's death , he was elected to a full term in 1946 . He has long advocated a strong U.S. policy in the Far East , including more aid to Chiang and more force against the Communists . This , and his charge that the State Department 's Far Eastern policy was " bankrupt , " caused his enemies in Washington to label him " the Senator from Formosa . " This political position , plus his Pacific Coast following , equip him particularly well to balance a ticket headed by Eisenhower .
