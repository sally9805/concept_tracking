A Chicago father , home early one afternoon last autumn , opened the door of his son 's bedroom and found himself staring at a terrifying tableau . His son , a 15-year-old vocational-school student , was sitting there , one forearm bared , a hypodermic syringe in his hand . Another boy was holding a teaspoon over the flame of a cigarette lighter . Both the syringe and the teaspoon contained heroin . <P> Weeping , the boy confessed that he had used drugs for a year-first marijuana on a dare from a schoolmate , then the virulent morphine derivative , heroin . The drug made him feel " high and light , " and after he met a peddler named " Greasy George , " he started using it regularly . To get a " fix " of heroin he had only to ask George : " Do you need a boy ? " or " Have you got a thing ? " For a dollar , the peddler would produce one of the capsules of white powder he kept hidden just inside the zipper of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends would repair to basements or bedrooms , furtively dissolve the powder with water in a spoon and give each other shots . <P> Snort of Horse . The case was not unique . During the past year , authorities have become aware of a tremendous and frightening spread of narcotic addiction among teenagers . In one New York court alone , during 1949 , there were 41 narcotics arrests of youths between 16 and 18 ; in 1950 the figure jumped to 161 . And there is no telling how many others are using narcotics . One Manhattan welfare worker guessed : " Thousands . " <P> The new addicts learn and change hophead jargon . They call a needle and a syringe a " spike &; dripper . " A sniff of heroin is a " snort of horse , " and an injection under the skin a " joy pop . " Many teen-agers quickly become " mainliners " - because it is cheaper and quicker if they inject the drug directly into a vein , most often with a safety pin and an eyedropper . <P> Once " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To get money for heroin , they steal at home , sell the drug on commission in school hallways and lavatories . Some boys become thieves and holdup artists ; many a teen-age girl has turned to prostitution . <P> Dim Hope . There is one dimly hopeful side to the teen-age dope problem . Unlike older people , few teen-agers appear to take to drugs because of psychological troubles ; youngsters usually start using narcotics either out of ignorance or the same reckless impulses which lead them to race hot rods . Though they are easier to wean , however , there are almost no facilities for taking care of them . On New York 's Rikers Island , youngsters have to endure the horrors of a sudden " cold turkey " cure or get none at all . Once released , many go right back to drugs again . And penalties for the vicious crime of dope-peddling are too lenient ( maximum : ten years ) to deter many from the hugely profitable trade .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
