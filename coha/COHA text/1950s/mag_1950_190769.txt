Soon after V-J day , proud U.S. cavalrymen raised a yellow and black billboard on the western outskirts of Tokyo . It read : " You are now entering Tokyo by courtesy of the 1st Cavalry Division-First in Manila ; First in Tokyo-The First Team . " As last week began , the dismounted troopers of the 1st Cavalry had every intention of adding " First in Pyongyang " to their battle honors . <P> Switching Signals . On the western flank of the U.N . army driving into North Korea , the cavalrymen advanced over the 38th parallel along the highway to Kum-chon , a railway center 80 miles southeast of Pyongyang . They ran smack into what they then decided were the strongest defense positions in North Korea . On heights overlooking bends in the highway the Communists had built concealed concrete pillboxes and log revetments-some with walls eight feet thick . <P> From these carefully prepared positions diehard North Korean soldiers poured fire onto the advancing cavalrymen . Red mines blew the treads off U.S. tanks and convoys were held up under fire for hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take all the burden off the troops on the ground . Rockets from F80 Shooting Stars set dry grass and bright autumn foliage ablaze , but failed to smash some Communist redoubts . In the first day of the attack the cavalry took many casualties , moved little more than a mile beyond the parallel . Said one officer : " It 's been rough work , rougher than we expected . We had hoped to be 25 miles into North Korea by this time . " <P> Changing signals , Major General Hobart Gay , the 1st Cavalry 's commander , converted his frontal assault to a three-pronged drive . One of his columns swung west of the highway , knifed in a sweeping end run to the railroad and highway north of Kumchon to cut the main Communist supply line . The British Commonwealth 27th Brigade leapfrogged U.S. troops , sliced toward Kumchon in a wide northeast arc . The main body of the 1st Cavalry Division continued to slog up the Kumchon highway behind Patton tanks . <P> Gay 's enveloping movement came off with textbook smoothness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kumchon . Trapped in the city and in the area south of it were nearly 20,000 North Korean troops . " They will not get out any tanks , guns or vehicles , " promised Gay . <P> Taking Trips . Nowhere else along the 200 miles of the semicircular U.N . front was North Korean resistance as stubborn as at Kumchon . On the 1st Cavalry 's right flank , the 1st R.O.K. Division under able Major General Paik Sun Yap ( TIME , July 24 ) raced ahead , aided by U.S. tanks and rockets from F-80s . Said trim , 30-year-old General Paik , " Now at least we have some tanks , too , and it is wonderful . My tactic is ' no stop . ' " He added proudly , " Now we can be like General Patton.
