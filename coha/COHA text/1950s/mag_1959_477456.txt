Do you believe that men may reach other planets almost any day now ? That flight to the stars is just a question of time ? That the first nation to get a foothold on the moon will have an overwhelming military advantage ? If so , the president of Caltech has some myth-puncturing news for you . EVERY American citizen of sixty years or more has witnessed in rapid succession the birth of the age of the automobile , the age of the airplane , the age of electronics , of radio , of television , and of nuclear energy ? not to mention the age of the movie , of rock ' n ' Toll , of the supermarket , and a few others . One might indeed expect that most of us would be quite indifferent to the dawn of another age . But not so . For no age has had a more shattering impact on the people of the world than the beginning , on October 4 , 1957 , of the space age . And for good reason . For , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for communication , and for destruction , it has been over four hundred yearssince a wholly new area of geographic exploration has been opened up . Naturally this has been an earth-shaking event . For the first time in world history men are no longer chained to their tiny planet . Man-made vehicles can now sail the untracked reaches of interplanetary space itself . It would not be reasonable to expect that such an event would be received calmly . To paraphrase a common Washington quip : " Anyone who is not thoroughly confused just does n't understand the situation . " The space cadets and Buck Rogers addicts are having a field day ? in the belief that public gullibility about space is inexhaustible . The confusion is understandable , for the conditions encountered by an object projected into a space trajectory are so unlike the conditions on earth as to defy any " common sense " discussion . Common sense is a distillation of human experience . And there has never been any human experience in space , where there is no air to breathe or to sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects have no weight and things that are dropped do not fall ; where frictional forces are absent and it takes no propulsive effort to keep an object moving forever ; where " perpetual motion " is a natural and indeed a necessary condition , else all objects would be pulled together into a single conglomerate by the inexorable force of gravity . Then , ton , it sounds like nonsense to be told that if you wish to make an object go slower you must speed it up , and if you wish to make it go faster it must be slowed down . Yet , for an object in a free orbit around the Earth or any other attracting body this is true . A push intended to speed up a satellite will only lift it to a higher orbit where it will rotate more slowly . Conversely , a retarding force will displace it into a speedier orbit closer to the attracting center . ( As the Sputniks and Explorers came into the atmosphere and were " retarded " by friction , they did indeed speed up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heating . ) Also , the vast speeds required to project objects into spatial orbits are such as to numb the imagination . How can even the hardened jet-plane traveler who is used to speeds of 600 miles per hour , which is 10 miles per minute , conceive of what it is like to travel at 5 miles per second ? Yet that is the speed of an Earth satellite . To escape from the Earth 's gravitational pull entirely one must travel at 7 miles per second ? and to escape from the pull of the Sun takes a speed , with respect to the Sun , of 26 miles per second . Nevertheless , great as these speeds are , they are overshadowed by the vastness of spatial distances . For example , if one could , in spite of the Sun 's pull , maintain in space a speed of 26 miles per second , it would take 23 days to reach Mars , over 3 years to reach Neptune , and 28,000 years to reach the nearest star ( Alpha Centauri ) . It even takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles per second ) 4 years to reach that star , 150,000 years to cross the Milky Way , and 2 billion years to travel to the most distant nebula . Clearly the reaches of interstellar space are still far beyond our grasp . A MILLION SECRETS W E MAY have " conquered space " ? yet we are still rather like a fly who has reached the outside of the windowpane but who , in a thousand lifetimes , could not begin to explore even the next county . We , too , must be satisfied with nearby interplanetary space for the rime being . Nevertheless , between the Sun and the orbit of tiny Pluto , the most distant planet , there lies a sphere 7 billion miles in diameter which is now accessible to human exploration and which may hold a million unimaginable secrets whose discovery , one by one , may keep human beings occupied for a thousand years . Even these relatively near regions of space offer a challenge to human curiosity and human ingenuity unequaled in all history . Human beings have a right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things about space which are true appear to be fantastic , it does not necessarily follow that everything fantastic is necessarily true . The laws of physics still apply ? science fiction writers to the contrary notwithstanding . It is not possible to propel tangible objects to speeds which exceed or even approach the speed of light . Antigravity screens ? no matter how handy they would be ? do not ( and will not ) exist . Radio waves in space do not bend around corners ; they can he reflected or refracted only by matter . To give an object a high speed always requires an amount of energy proportional to the square of the speed , and , no matter how clever we are , to obtain energy we must either consume fuel in some form ? chemical or nuclear ? or we must collect and convert energy from the Sun or other radiant body . In fact , the problem of obtaining enough energy for space exploration and converting it to a suitable form constitutes the most imposing barrier to many attractive ventures . Not even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photonic , " etc. ) can avoid the inexorable requirements of energy . It takes energy to acquire speed and energy to overcome gravity . And energy always costs money ! If we are interested in human space travel , it must also be recognized that , as far as we know , there is no place in the Solar System other than the Earth where men will hnd in usable form all four essential things they will need or travel and survival -- oxygen , water , food , and fuel . Hence , man must carry with him , as he leaves the earth , adequate supplies of these things for his entire journey . This will mean a colossal cost in the energy required to get him and his supplies lifted from the Earth into a spatial orbit . It takes roughly 50 to 100 pounds of rocket fuel for each pound placed in an orbit around the Earth or to the vicinity of the Moon . This mounts up to mighty fuel requirements for extended space expeditions . We would do well to ask seriously the question of why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much it is worth . THE FIRST SURPRISE I E T us begin with the problems of orbiting .... 1 the Earth at distances of only a few hundred to a few thousand miles . As a first step , this is a region well worth thorough exploration . With existing rocket thrusts of 300,000 to 500,000 pounds ( 150 to 250 tons ) one can place vehicles wills a total useful weight of from one-and-a-hall to three tons , or so , into orbit ( excluding the dead weight of rocket cases and burned-out motors ) . Such vehicles may carry a large amount of useful instrumentation plus the necessary power supplies for the instruments and the radio to transmit the measurements to Earth . Even a man might go into orbit with enough supplies to sustain him for a short time and return him safely to Earth . What values may such close-in expeditions have ? First , they will give us valuable experience in what the space environment is like and what it takes to keep men and instruments in operation . Second , they can yield a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the universe which will always be of greatest interest to human beings ? the Earth itself . The Earth 's gravitational , magnetic , and electric fields have very great intrinsic and practical interest , yet they have heretofore been accessible to direct measurement only within a few miles of the Earth 's surface . It will take dozens or scores of instrumented satellites in orbits ranging from equatorial to polar , covering distances-from 100 miles to 100,000 miles above the Earth , to explore these fields adequately . What will such explorations reveal ? No one knows and no one can predict . Space , it must be emphasized , is a great unknown area . Columbus could not have known what continents he would encounter . He set out to find a western route to India ; but America got in the way . So it will be in space . We will set out on one mission and find something else . The first U. S. satellite , Explorer I , in fact , repeated Columbus ' experience . It carried a Geiger counter to make some cosmic-ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's surface ? has proved of vast interest to physicists in recent years and has added immeasurably to our understanding of atomic and nuclear structure . But that first Geiger counter in space discovered a new belt of radiation , thousands of times more intense than the known cosmic rays ? so intense , in fact , that it paralyzed the counter completely . Later satellite experiments showed that this radiation extends from a few hundred to more than ten thousand miles above the Earth , following the contours of the Earth 's magnetic field . The nature and source of this radiation are still unknown , but it is of great potential theoretical and practical importance and should be thoroughly explored . A dozen large satellites adequately equipped for this one job alone would be a worthwhile investment . Since this radiation is intense enough to kill an unshielded man in a few hours or a few days , it would be wise to know quite a good deal about it before men venture to spend much time within this belt . Unfortunately , this intense radiation ( known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which many of the most valuable observations about the Earth can be taken . The weather patterns , the upper radio-reflection layers , the gravitational irregularities ( which may tell something of the shape and structure of the Earth ) , and many other things should be studied at heights of 200 miles to 10,000 miles . But if men are to be injured and photographic plates fogged and other instruments affected by this radiation , then it poses some difficult problems to be solved . This is but one example of how a single new discovery may change our preconceived notions and alter many of our plans about space travel and space research . It is , after all , the unknown that is the challenge of space . If we were confident we knew all about everything existing out there , it would be useless to spend the money to explore . AS ONE leaves the Earth behind , the next object of interest is , of course , the Moon , rotating around the Earth about 240,000 miles away . After centuries of speculation it seems almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make contact with the Moon and learn something about it . The Moon 's surface has been examined from the Earth with the most powerful instruments known to science ? telescopes , spectroscopes , radiometers . We know a good deal about it ? its size , its surface contours ( mountains up to 26,000 feet in height ) , its temperature ( 250 ? F. in the middle of the sun-baked day , and down to 220 ? below zero in the middle of the night ) . We know that the Moon always presents the same face to the Earth ? that is , it rotates about its own axis at exactly the same rate it revolves about the Earth . Hence , the Moon 's " day " is about 28 of our days in length-336 hours of sunshine , followed by 336 hours of darkness , illumined only by reflected light from the Earth . We know that the Moon has no atmosphere , no free oxygen , no water , no life . But we do not vet know what it is made of ? whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know what caused the pockmarks ? meteor impacts or volcanic eruptions , or both . We do know that the surface is probably unlike anything on Earth , for there has been no erosion by wind or rain or ice or snow , no inundation by oceans or lakes or rivers ; hence , there are no sedimentary rocks , no glacier-cut valleys . No corrosion or oxidation or decay has been at work ; hence , we shall find no deposits of coal or oil or gas . But otherwise , thesame chemical elements that are found on Earth ? and throughout the rest of the universe ? will surely be present on the Moon in somewhat the same proportions , except for the gases like hydrogen , oxygen , nitrogen , argon , etc. , which the Moon 's gravitation is too weak to retain . Ordinary water would also quickly evaporate and esca pe . But many things we neither know nor can pre-diet . We must get there first with instruments and , sometime in the future , with human ob servers to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system is even greater than our curiosity about the Moon , partly because their greater distances make seeing more difficult , and partly because some of them have such cloudy atmospheres that we can never see the surface at all until we get there . The nearest planets to the Earth are Venus and Mars . The orbit of Venus is closer to the Sun than the Earth 's , and when " in conjunction " Venus comes ( about once every two years ) to within about 26 million miles from the Earth . Mars ' orbit is farther away from the Sun than the Earth 's , and every IS months or so Mars comes within 50 million miles of the Earth . The more distant planets are very far away indeed . Probes which will pass in the vicinity of either Venus or Mars , however , are now well within the reach of rocket technology , and the launching of such instrumented probes will no doubt be attempted in the not too distant future . Vehicles sent out to probe these planets will not return to Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large objects can be launched with the huge quantities of fuel and intricate guidance equipment required to achieve a return journey . The first probes will , like the Russian Lunik and the U. S. Pioneer IV , escape from the A Stillness at Appomattox TDO N'T believe the people under ' stand our present-day situation concerning public education in Virginia . It 's not the education of our children that 's so important . It 's states ' rights . ? State Senator Charles T. Moses , of Appomattox , Virginia , quoted in the Washington , D. C. , Post and Times Herald , April 12 , 1959 . Earth 's gravitational field , will have their orbits disturbed only slightly as they approach their target , and will then continue on into an orbit around the Sun . A probe fired at Mars will enter a solar orbit somewhat similar to that of Mars itself . Incidentally , it is no trick to have the object go into a solar orbit . It ca n't help it . The trick would be to give an object enough speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about sending out probes to secure information about Mars or Venus or other distant points is the enormous power requirements for the radio transmitter to send observations back to Earth . A dead , voiceless , and invisible object would he quite useless . At distances of 50 million miles from the Earth a radio transmitter would have to have a power of thousands of watts in order to be heard even with very large receiving antennas . ( A large Earth broadcast station may radiate 50,000 watts . ) And the power required increases as the square of the distance . No one has yet developed a scheme to supply any such power continuously to a space vehicle . Even heavy loads of batteries supply only a few watts of power for a few days . Solar cells are doubtless the ultimate answer ? but high-power cells will be exceedingly heavy and bulky ? and none have ever been built . " PLATFORMS " IN SPACE B U T if the Moon and planets are interest-ing , we must not forget that space itself will offer some interesting adventures too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had very little experience in any environment save one in which we can travel in any path at any speed we wish . On land , on sea , or in the air we ran , within wide limits , move about as we please , can travel any given path at any speed we select . Imagine our surprise , then , when we find that in any particular orbit around the Earth there is , for any given point , one and only one speed at which we can travel and still stay in that orbit . An automobile on Earth may circle a one-mile track once per hour or once per minute , or anything in between . But a satellite in a circular orbit which is , say , 500 miles above the Earth can only go at a speed of 41/2 miles per second , and will thus complete one revolution in about 103 minutes . At 5,000 miles up , the speed will be just under 3 miles per second , or one revolution in 5% hours . The Moon , at a distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two-thirds of a mile per second ( about 2,300 miles per hour ) , or one revolution in 28 days . The square of the period is in proportion to the cube of the major axis , " said Johannes Kepler in about 1600 , and this applies to the motion of any object in the gravitational field about any other object ? to satellites about the Earth , about the Moon , about the Sun , or about Mars . Only when an object gets far outside the attractive field of all other objects ? a condition only reached when at a distance greater than 100 billion miles from the Sun ? does one regain independent control over path and speed . Thus , two satellites in the same orbit around the Earth ( or the Sun ) can not have a " race " ? for to have a different speed requires a different orbit . This means , of course , that it is impossible to have a stationary space platform near the Earth . Any object in orbit must be rotating about the Earth at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object circling west to east above the Earth 's equator at 22,000 miles height , the speed of rotation will be once in 24 hours and hence , since the Earth rotates beneath it at the same period , the object will appear stationary . It will , nevertheless , actually be traveling at 100 miles per minute . Any object which attempts to " catch up " with such a platform can do so only in a lower orbit . Furthermore , only in an orbit over and parallel to the Earth 's equator can such an apparently stationary object exist . In any orbit inclined to the equator , the object will appear to drift back and forth each day along a north-south line . Since the continental United States is not crossed by the equator , no " stationary " object will ever appear directly above us , though at that height it would still be visible above the southern hori/on . This does not mean that we will have no " space platforms , " for vehicles which move in various orbits around the Earth may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But guiding another vehicle in such a way as to catch up to and land on such a " platform " will offer navigational problems never encountered on Earth . The weightless condition in free flight also imposes some unfamiliar situations . Imagine , for example , trying to drink a glass of water in the usual way when traveling in a space capsule . If you quickly lower the glass , the water will stay suspended in midair . One of the first " man-inspace " experiments will be to see how bodily functions will be altered when there is no gravity to help ? or hinder . At least one wo n't have to sit down to rest ? just relax and float ! Can one " drop a bomb " from a satellite ? One can certainly release a bomb , but it will certainly not fall to Earth . It will , of necessity , continue along with the launching satellite in the same orbit and with the same speed . In order to drop , its speed must be reduced by projecting it forcibly backward from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into an orbit which hits the Earth 's surface at the desired place . It ran be done . But since bombs dropped from 30,000 feet do not always hit the target , we must expect additional difficulties when bombing from 300 miles up ? especially when traveling at five miles per second , TUD1 five miles per minute . At first we would be lucky even to hit the right hemisphere . SHOOTING FROM THE MOON EVEN more interesting problems arise if one thinks of establishing a military base on the- Moon and shooting weapons at specific targets on the Earth . The Moon is moving about the Earth at 2,300 miles per hour , the Earth is 240,000 miles away and it is spinning so that any target on its surface is moving along at a speed up to 1,000 miles per hour at the equator . A projectile must first escape from the Moon 's gravitational field and then get injected into a suitable Earth-bound trajectory . The time of travel to the Earth will probably be a day or two . Any duck hunter can appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when . he is shooting from a car going 2,200 utiles per hour ( and the bird is also spinning ! when the bullet available travels a highly curved path and takes two days to reach the target . It may take quite a lot of practice to attain the desired accuracy under such difficult circumstances . Again we will be lucky at first to hit the Earth at all ? still luckier to hit the right side . Even the computation of what the trajectory would he is a major problem . And we have n't even mentioned the problems of getting all the men and materials up to the Moon in the first place . Why not stay home and fire our rockets from here ? There is , in fact , a serious danger that in concentrating military effort on fanciful space schemes we will neglect the serious and urgent problems of ordinary intercontinental ballistic missiles ? one weapon whose future importance is very clear . The establishment of human colonies on the Moon or Venus or Mars is certainly an irresistible human dream ? a dream whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose that these places will offer very attractive living conditions to the prospective settler . No place on Earth could conceivably be as unattractive as the airless , waterless , lifeless surface of the Moon . The best that can be said is that it is a good place to get away from other people ; and it is a fine place ? with its low gravity ? for ambitious high jumpers ? if it is possible to jump at all in a pressurized space suit with oxygen tank attached . Furthermore , the difficulties of sending human beings to the Moon are enormous . We might imagine that a man with all the necessary oxygen , space suits , food , water , and instruments could be packed into a vehicle with a total weight of 2,000 pounds . A rocket with a thrust of some 300,000 pounds could project this vehicle into an orbit which would pass near the Moon . But our vehicle must carry along also enough fuel to fire a retro-rocket in order to reduce its speed , counter the Moon 's gravitational pull , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moon . It seems reasonable to estimate that it would take two or more pounds of fuel for each pound actually landed on the Moon . Thus , 4,000 pounds of fuel would have to be lifted from the Earth in addition to the original 2,000-pound load , making a total load of 6,000 pounds . A total thrust of 900,000 pounds would now be needed . But this would leave our man permanently stranded on the Moon with no fuel to return to Earth . We must then lift from the Earth enough fuel to lift him off the Moon again , and this will multiply our initial thrust requirement by another factor of 3 ? to 2,700,000 pounds . And if we want to allow the man and his vehicle to land safely on the Earth again , he will need fuel for that , too ? and our initial thrust may climb to 5 million pounds or more . A single rocket with a thrust of 5 million pounds is far beyond the reach of present technology ; large and clumsy ( and expensive ) dusters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send one man alone on such a journey . Think of the problem of a count-down on the Moon ! Hence , it has been suggested that such journeys be made in installments , using orbiting space platforms to which fuel and equipment may be transported by many rockets , each bearing a smaller load . But the total fuel requirement is not reduced by this technique ? rather it will be greatly increased , for we must lift the intermediate space platform off the Earth , too , and with it the crews of many men required to assemble the necessary equipment . The technical problems to be met are probably not insoluble ? but the expense and effort in-volved will be colossal , and it is unrealistic to expect the " man on the Moon " mission to be achieved in the very near future . Sending a man to Mars or Venus or other bodies will be even more difficult ? and the price of the journey correspondingly higher . These considerations suggest that it is hardly realistic to expect that we may someday relieve the congestion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moon or on other planets . Since the surface area of the Moon is only one-sixteenth , and of Mars only one-quarter , that of the Earth , it would probably be cheaper to build great floating platforms over the surface of all the Earth 's oceans ( thus multiplying the available " land " area by four ) rather than try to transport a few hundred million people , with all their water , oxygen , and food , to the Moon or Mars . It would appear that population control would he still simpler ! One hears that there may be valuable minerals on the Moon or Venus or Mars waiting to be mined . There may be . But we are not running out of aluminum or gold or platinum or uranium here on Earth . The chief difficulty is that some of them are found only in rather low-grade ores so that it is very expensive to extract them . But it would surely be far cheaper to extract gold or other metals from sea water than to haul them in from the Moon . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , be a vast lunar deposit of diamonds , though it would take a lot of pretty big diamonds to pay for a Moon rocket . And if that many diamonds were suddenly thrown on the market the price would promptly collapse ! In other words , research and exploration rather than colonization or militarization or exploitation should be the first goals for the Moon and , indeed , fur all other space stations . in spite of the fanciful potentialities , some extraordinarily sober thinking is going to be required to insure a sensible allocation of national resources to space ventures . WHAT WE MAY FIND OUT K NOWLEDGE after all , can be far more valuable than any precious materials . And since outer space is a veritable sea of ignorance , the opportunities for new knowledge are enormous . It is pointless to ask at present what the practical value of the new knowledge might be . We can not even predict what the new knowledge will be . But human beings have never yet explored a sea of ignorance or opened up new areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unforeseeable ? rewards . Fortunately , most of the new knowledge we wish to seek can be obtained with unmanned vehicles , avoiding for the present the great cost of carrying human beings . Among the most avid enthusiasts for research in space are the astronomers . This is not only because they arc anxious to learn more about the Moon and the planets , and it is not because they expect to make journeys to the distant galaxies ? because they know how vast the distances are to even the very nearest stars . But when the astronomer can send his telescopes and spectroscopes up above the murky , quivering blanket of air in which they have always been immersed , he knows he will learn new things . He is exasperated to realize that light from a distant galaxy has been traveling unimpeded for millions of years through space on its way to the Earth and then , just one-thousandth of a second before it finally reaches his telescope , it strikes the upper parts of the Earth 's atmosphere ? there to be absorbed or grossly distorted or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , destroyed entirely . Many of the radiations which might have been in the initial beams ? in the ultraviolet , infrared , X-ray , and radio portions of the spectrum ? are absorbed entirely by the atmosphere . In all cases atmospheric irregularities cause a blurring of the image . No wonder the astronomer , long an inhabitant of high mountain sites , now eagerly looks forward to an observatory in space . A good-sized satellite about 500 miles above the Earth will suit him just fine . It will be an unmanned satellite , of course ; the astronomer will be content to stay home and analyze the information the instruments send him . He is aware of other difficulties too . He wo n't soon be taking a fine photograph and sending it back to Earth . How will he get the negatives hack ? And what will prevent the Van Allen radiation from fogging all his plates ? Television is not yet up to the task ; and where does the TV transmitter get its power ? But much spectroscopic data ( on the intensity of various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transmittal via radio , and human ingenuity is already making progress on many of the other problems . If the astronomer seeks to be the most active space scientist , he will find the meteorologist and the communications engineer close seconds . To be able to have a view of the cloud pattern overthe entire Earth as it exists at any one time is the dream of the former , and to bounce radio waves from Earth to satellite and back to Earth or to another satellite opens new vistas for the latter . To observe the weather does not mean you can control it , of course , but it will surely help in prediction . Vanguard II is only a beginning in this direction . WEAPONS AND MONEY F INALLY , the military technologist is probably the greatest space enthusiast of all . The possibility of space vehicles arose out of a military weapon ? the long-range rocket . Military men and the civilians who worked fur them are justifiably proud of the astounding possibilities which their invention opened up . They know , too , that as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their military rockets , they will automatically be contributing to the advance of space technology . Space research , conversely , will help to improve military weapons . It is not yet clear whether Earth-encircling satellites will make practical weapon-carrying vehicles for direct military operations , but certainly such satellites will have many reconnaissance , communication , weather-observation , and other functions of military value . There are , of course , many who regret spending such large sums on space research when there are so many other problems of human health , human welfare , and even human survival , which need to be solved . But one must remember that scientific and technological breakthroughs can not be planned in advance . Spending huge sums of money comes after a breakthrough , not before . The billion-dollar atomic bomb project did not produce the discovery of nuclear fission ; it followed it . ' We have achieved a new breakthrough in space technology ; it is time to exploit it . Maybe someday a scientific breakthrough in understanding cancer will occur . Then , and only then , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new discovery to the benefit of all human beings . We should rejoice when a breakthrough occurs in any field and be prepared to exploit it . For conquest of ignorance in any area is always eventually of advantage to all . One hundred years from now the new knowledge attained in space research will surely have paid untold , unforeseen , and unexpected di ? idends . Already the dawning of the space age has impelled Americans to seek to improve their schools . That alone may be worth the cost of all our space rockets .
