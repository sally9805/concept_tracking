Last week thousands of Korean Communist soldiers scampered over the 38th parallel which had divided Korea since 1945 . There the Reds hoped to sit in safety while Washington and Lake Success argued over a decision which should have been made weeks before . <P> Home Base . The strange thing about this argument was that it should have occurred at all . Rarely in history had anyone questioned the right of a nation under attack to strike at its enemies ' home base . One of the few historical situations similar to that facing the U.N . had developed during the U.S. Civil War when President Abraham Lincoln believed that some of his generals shared a widespread Northern belief that Union armies should confine themselves to defending Northern territory . Lincoln was dismayed first by the delaying tactics of General George McClellan , later by the sluggishness of General George Meade who allowed Lee 's defeated Confederate army to slip safely across the Potomac River after Gettysburg . Said Lincoln of Meade 's performance : " I 'll be hanged if I could think of anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creek . " <P> In the world 's free nations last week there were men who urged that U.N . forces content themselves with shooing North Koreans across the 38th parallel . Leading spokesman for this group was Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India . Nehru 's avowed reasons for opposing the crossing : fear that invasion of North Korea would bring Communist China , possibly even Russia , into the war ; the prospect that by following North Korean aggressors across the parallel the U.N . forces might themselves become guilty of aggression . Nehru revealed another , less far-fetched motive when he snapped , " I am no great admirer of South Korean President Rhee anyhow . " <P> The U.S. and its allies in the U.N . offered positive reasons why U.N . troops should cross the parallel . Their arguments : <P> North Korea 's war potential must be destroyed . <P> The U.N . must demonstrate that international crime does not pay . <P> The U.N . had repeatedly declared that Korea must be united . If Korea is treated as a single nation , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappears . " <P> No one had ever recognized the 38th parallel as a permanent political frontier . <P> Communist Premier Chou En-lai 's threat that China " will not stand aside should the imperialists wantonly invade " North Korea was only propaganda . <P> If Russia or China intended to intervene in Korea , they should have done so earlier when they could have pushed U.N . forces into the sea . <P> Stop Short ? In Washington a State Department spokesman neatly summarized the U.S. position . Said he : " The whole Korean operation would be a bust if we stopped at the 38th parallel . If we stop short we might as well have stayed out to begin with . "
