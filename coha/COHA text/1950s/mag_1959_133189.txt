Conerly looked up at the fans who a few years ago had hung signs saying , " Conerly must go ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they finally turned over the microphone to him at the end of the ceremonies marking Charlie Conerly Day , he said simply , " Ah 've had mah ups and downs heah with the Giants an ' I want to thank you all foh stickin ' by me . Thank you . " // He posed impatiently for a moment by a Corvette , which was one of his gifts , then tossed off his sideline cape and began warming up for the game with the Washington Redskins . The Giants took the kickoff , and for the first minutes the old pro seemed a bit nervous and excited . His passes were thrown too hard and too high , reflecting a tension he had not shown during the rituals ; then Conerly settled down . He played the first half of the game , picking the Washington defense apart coldly and precisely , throwing three touchdown passes and leading the Giants to a 45-14 victory which ensured them at least a tie for the Eastern Conference championship . Against the injury-flawed Washington defense , he changed his call at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaknesses created as the Redskins tried to compensate for lack of personnel by overloading the defense at the expected point of impact . Twice he threw touchdowns to Bob Schnelker , a towering end , when Schnelker was covered by Richie McCabe , a small ( 6 foot ) defensive halfback . Beautifully protected by the Giant line , he had time to pass , and , when the Redskins dropped off troops from the front line to blanket receivers , he had fine runners to call on in Frank Gifford , Mel Triplett and Alex Webster . It was a satisfying victory . // Frank Gifford , who carried the ball 16 times and gained 159 yards against the Redskins , reflects the attitude of the Giant team toward Conerly . " He means a lot for me , " Gifford said . " He 's a pro . When he quits , maybe I 'll quit , too . " // Aside from the innumerable calls from well-wishers and fans , the week before the Redskin game was much the same as the 140-odd other weeks Conerly has spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , been the Giant quarterback , and the pressure of knowing that the team depends upon him more than upon any other one player for victory does not bother him . " It 's a little different , " he said before this game , " knowing everybody expects me to do well . I 'm excited , with the banquet after the game and all . But I 'll be all right when the whistle blows . " He was . // The Giant victory was made doubly significant by the heroics of another quarterback in Cleveland . John Brodie ( aged 24 ) , who has been with the San Francisco 49ers for three years , took over as quarterback for the team in a bitterly played game with the Cleveland Browns which meant the difference between a possible division championship and ignominious collapse . When the 49ers were crushed by the Baltimore Colts last week , not the smallest blow to their hopes for their first Western Conference title was the serious injury to their own old pro quarterback , Y. A. Tittle . The injury meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toughest defensive teams at the end of a disastrous road trip , had to depend upon the relatively untried Brodie at quarterback . The least dismayed member of the team was Brodie . // " I 'm not worried , " he said a couple of days before the game . " I 've got too much to think about to worry . That 's one of the secrets of this game  --  you must keep thinking . You have to think athletically . I mean you have to occupy your mind with the ways you can beat a team . You have to feel confidence in what you are about them beating you . " // Brodie is a handsome youngster . He is an excellent golfer who will play on the pro winter circuit . Unlike Conerly , whose week was fairly routine , Brodie found his pregame preparation considerably longer in work hours because of his starting assignment . // " I sat in with the coaches while they looked at the movies of the Colt game , " he said . " And I sat in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ready list is a selection of plays designed especially for the team to be played that week . " It takes up lots of time  --  maybe 20 or 30 hours of the four days you spend preparing for a game . But that 's when you do the thinking . " // Brodie and Tittle each started three of the San Francisco exhibition games this year , but when the league season began Head Coach Red Hickey picked Tittle as his quarterback. // " I 'm not worried about Brodie , " Hickey said before the Cleveland game . " He looks on this as an opportunity . I 'm sure he thinks he should have been my quarterback all the time . " // Although Brodie would not say so it is likely that he did . He is a very self-possessed young man , careful in what he says . " By nature , he 's a volatile guy who might really like to pop off now and then , " a friend of his said . " But he 's also got self-control . He never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He 's never critical of his teammates and never brags on himself . " // The technical difficulties of moving in as sole surviving quarterback offered no problem to Brodie . // " The only thing I 've got to get used to is game pressure , " he said . " If you have n't been working with the first string on offense , you have trouble making handoffs and hitting receivers on pass patterns , but Coach Hickey worked Tittle and me so that we got equal opportunity to practice with the No. 1 unit . The first and second backfields run alternate plays in practice , but the quarterbacks run a play with each backfield so that both of us work with all the backs . That way you get used to the little differences in technique and speed , and the handoffs get to be second nature . Like taking the snapback from center . During the training season Tittle and I work for 15 minutes a day with the centers . Does n't sound like a very complicated thing , but you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " // Brodie 's only protracted exposure to game pressure this year came against the Chicago Bears when the 49ers opened their eastern tour with a 14-3 loss . // " You have to be in there to get yourself in the habit of waiting , " he said . " That 's something only game experience can do for you . You have to be under pressure enough so that you learn to ignore it . A couple of the passes I threw against the Bears I threw too soon . I knew it when I let go of the ball , but I had n't played enough to force myself to wait until the last second . I think with that game under my belt , I 'll do better against Cleveland . " // Against Cleveland , on an icy-cold , windy afternoon , Brodie passed for two touchdowns in San Francisco 's surprising 21-20 victory . On one , to J. D. Smith , the big 49er halfback , he rolled out to his right . His first target was covered . Despite driving pressure from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a safety-valve , last-resort receiver , broke loose , Brodie calmly threw the ball through the gusty wind into Smith 's hands for a 21-yard touchdown . His other touchdown pass , to End Billy Wilson , was thrown under the same kind of rush from the Cleveland line and again the ball traveled 21 yards for the touchdown . This pass had to be precisely on target because Wilson , streaking across the field on the Cleveland goal line , was tenaciously covered by Warren Lahr . The third San Francisco touchdown came on a 12-yard run by Hugh McElhenny , and all three of them were made during a six-minute span of the second quarter . In the second half Brodie 's sure touch became a bit uncertain , and the game was saved by the very good San Francisco defense . // " I 'm not satisfied with myself , " Brodie said after the game . He had soaked under a hot shower for 30 minutes , erasing the chill of the afternoon . " I was n't nervous or anything , but I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rusty . I had receivers just as wide-open in the second half and I could n't connect . If we had lost I would have felt like a bum . " // The 49er victory practically eliminated Cleveland from the race in the Eastern Conference . " We 're snake-bit , " Coach Paul Brown said sadly after the club 's second straight 21-20 loss , and his explanation is as good as any for the sudden decline of the Browns . Two Sundays ago Lou Groza unbelievably missed an extra point and Ray Renfro dropped a touchdown pass in the clear . Against the 49ers , one of Cleveland 's two lost fumbles and one of Plum 's six intercepted passes of the year each led to 49er scores . The Giants now lead by two games , with two to play , one of them against Cleveland next Sunday . The Philadelphia Eagles , after losing to the Pittsburgh Steelers 31-0 , are still tied with Cleveland in second . The Steelers , finishing as strongly as they did in 1958 , have , in the last three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three Eastern Conference leaders , and proved to their own satisfaction that they are the strongest team in the division . However , the inexorable logic of mathematics makes it impossible for them to catch the Giants . // San Francisco 's victory leaves it tied with the Baltimore Colts , 35-21 victors over Los Angeles , and probably makes the Colt-49er game in San Francisco Saturday the decisive game in the battle for the Western Conference championship . It is , of course , conceivable that the Chicago Bears , one game behind the leaders , could tie for the title , but it is very unlikely . The Bears entertain the thorny Steelers Sunday . // The 49ers return home to a city which had resigned itself to a second straight " dying swan " finish by one of its sports teams . Said a sad San Francisco writer , before the Cleveland victory , " Our baseball and football heroes are tigers , until they tangle with tigers . " He remembered the horrific collapse of the baseball Giants this year and the second-half fainting spell which cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit Lions in 1957 . SPORTS ILLUSTRATED 'S San Francisco correspondent , Robert Boyle , reports that even the beatniks who , oddly enough , are 49er fans , had given up . Pierre Delattre , the far-out pastor of the Bread and Wine Mission , opined that the 49er collapse in the East was due to a loss of " illumination . " The beats consider the 49ers ' famous " Alley-Oop " pass from Tittle to R. C. Owens a sort of mystical experience , with the ball being " the center of a focus of unity " between passer and receiver . The re-illumined 49ers have kindled hope again in the breasts of the beat and the square . At least until next Saturday night .
