Change Comes Hard <P> Sir : Some of the best news coming from the U.S. is of the dignified battle being fought by the Rev. Martin Luther King and his flock in Montgomery , Ala . Congratulations ! How one must admire the dignity of our colored fellow citizens . How that dignity contrasts with the attitude of the rabble-rousing race haters . The Rev. Mr. King and his people know they are on the winning side , on the side of the future . The others show all the nervousness and pettiness of people who know they are fighting a losing battle . ( THE RT . REV . ) LEO A. RUDLOFF , O.S.B. Abbot Dormition Abbey Jerusalem <P> Sir : Believe it or not , the South is a part of the U.S. , and is entitled to majority rule . If the majority of the people of a state want segregated schools , they should have them . The minority have the right to demand equal facilities , and a state which fails to provide them should be penalized . But to integrate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime against democracy . Such action will only harm the public schools of the South . TERRELL W. ECKER Laredo , Texas <P> Sir : Florida 's Governor Collins says : " Negroes must contribute by changes in their own attitudes . " Are the whites in Montgomery , Ala. contributing to their change of attitudes by bombing the Mt . Olive Baptist Church ? ALBERT E. HUTCHINS Bradford , Pa . <P> <P> Road Runners of ' 57 <P> Sir : Congratulations to Cartoonist Osborn Jan. 28 for his jab at the atrociously crass ' 57 cars-following fast on the clashed colors of ' 56 . Ugh ! MARCIA MASCIA Port Chester , N.Y . <P> <P> Sir : Robert Osborn is so right . Would suggest that the Detroit planners make a survey on what the American people desire in the way of a design instead of trying to outdo each other in seeing who can put the most of what on which and where . MRS . R. B. FROCK Pasadena , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : Mr. Osborn is a damned good cartoonist , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general taste somewhat more refined , Detroit would soon have to change . Why do Americans like such hideous cars ? ANATOL SPIRO Copenhagen <P> Sir : The ' 57 models remind me of the fierce , beady-eyed road runner , an unpleasant bird of the desert that never flies but runs along the ground , then pauses with its tail in the air while it takes a greedy look for its prey . SELENA MCKINLEY Los Angeles <P> For a custom-built road runner , see cut. - ED . <P> <P> Arabian Knight <P> Sir : Thank you for your thoughtprovoking , ah-inspiring , bully article on the sex life of King Saud . I vote him the man of any year ! LORETTA MAY Concord , N.H. <P> <P> Sir : What this country needs is a good 5 burnoose and two Sauds in every pot . Do you think a band of small businessmen , clad in their native costume ( i.e. , working clothes ) , could hit Generous John Foster for a small loan ? If Saud can put his hand out , how about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on trucks , new taxes on having over four employees , old taxes on telephones , travel , entertainment-just plain taxes ad nauseam .
