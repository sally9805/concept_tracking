txt WASHINGTON , May 26 ? Robert M. Hitchcock , who prosecuted the Amerasia case in 1945 , testified today that he had been gravely handicapped because the Government 's best evidence had been produced by illegal seizures by Federal agents . The prosecution , he asserted , was in fact fortunate under the circumstances to have done as well as it did . Mr. Hitchcock , in 1945 an attorney in the Department of Justice and now in private practice , appeared at a closed hearing of the Senate subcommittee investigating Senator Joseph R. McCarthy 's charges of Communist penetration of the State Department . His summary and opening statement were made available to reporters on authority of the subcommittee chairman , Senator Millard E. Tydings , Democrat of Maryland . No transcript of the questions asked in cross-examination was given out . Senator McCarthy , Republican of Wisconsin , asserted that this was " an almost unbelievable development in ' operation whitewash ' . " " The new practice of hearing a witness in secret session and carefully selecting the parts of his testimony which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret , " he added , " is fantastic beyond belief . " In 1945 , after raids on the New York offices of Amerasia , a magazine of Far Eastern affairs , in which secret Government documents were seized , six persons were arrested . The original charge was conspiracy to commit espionage , but in the end this was reduced to unlawful possession of the papers . Four persons were cleared . They were John S. Service , then and now a foreign service officer of the State Department ; Kate Louise Mitchell , a co-editor of Amerasia ; Mark Gayn , a writer , and Andrew Roth , then a reserve lieutenant in the Office of Naval Intelligence , Philip Jaffe , editor of Amerasia , was fined $2,500 . Emmanuel S. // Larsen , then but not now a State Department official , was fined $500 . Senator McCarthy has incorporated the Amerasia incident into his general campaign against the State Department , and there have been other Republican charges that the prosecution of the case was soft , or a " whitewash . " Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after leaving Federal service entered a Buffalo , N. Y. , law firm , in which an uncle of Miss Mitchell , the late James M. Mitchell , was then a partner . Mr. Hitchcock told the subcommittee that there was " not the slightest connection between the Amerasia case and my association with my present firm . " " There was no connection of any character between me and my present firm or between me or any member of my present firm while the Amerasia case was being processed and for a period of full3 , one year and four months after the grand jury refused to indict Miss Mitchell , " he asserted . He was brought into the firm , he said , by Lyman Bass and did not meet Mr. Mitchell until after the arrangement had been made . As to the handling of the prosecution , Mr. Hitchcock testified that agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation had made several entries into the offices of Amerasia without warrants and likewise into the apartment of Mr. Larsen . There has been previous evidence that Frank Bielaski , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had gone into Amerasia 's headquarters without a warrant . No Criticism of the F. B. T. " Nothing is clearer under Federal law , " Mr. Hitchcock told the subcommittee , " than that evidence secured as a result of illegal searches will be suppressed upon the application of those whose Constitutional right to the privacy of their homes , their persons and their effects has been violated . " This is said with no criticism whatsoever of the F. B. f . This nation was at war , and it seems to me that no reasonable person could have anything but praise for the F. B. for utilizing this method to secure proof in a case where there was any basis for believing that the national security was involved . " Because the evidence was so susceptible of being thrown out altogether , Mr. Hitchcock testified , the Government agreed with Mr. Jaffe 's lawyer to recommend a fine and no jail sentence . It was , he asserted in substance , this or nothing . As to Mr. Larsen , the former prosecutor added , the prosecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendant had been " corrupted " by Mr. Jaffe and because the Larsen case was not a strong one without use of the illegally obtained material . Mr. Hitchcock testified that Mr. Service , a review of whose loyalty file was opened by coincidence only today at the State Department , was cleared unanimously by the twenty grand jurors . Twelve of the twenty are ? necessary to indict . Senator Tydings told reporters that Mr. Hitchcock had been called to testify simply as to " why the Amerasia prosecution was n't more successful than it was . " The Senator declined to attempt to evaluate the testimony , saying that this was for the public to decide . Federal Bureau of Investigation agents who worked on the case will be heard Monday . During the day the State Department attacked Senator McCarthy again , asserting : " His irrepressible and irresponsible charges have not resulted in the disclosure of a single Communist in the State Department . " They have resulted in great harm to our foreign policy abroad , and in serious injury to the persons unjustly accused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
