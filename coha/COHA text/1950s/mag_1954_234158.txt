Once upon a time , record stores were as dignified as the free public library . Popular recordings were stacked in bins , and hardly anybody thought to dignify them by collecting them in albums . Nowadays , pop albums are almost as common as paperback novels . And more and more , they are packaged with the same kind of half-dressed jacket heroines that the reprint publishers have long used to sell paperbacks . <P> On the current shelves , Victor 's Music to Help You Sleep offers such sentimental oldies as Beautiful Dreamer , Love Walked In and several more , with a come-hither jacket picture of a redhead in negligee perched on the edge of bed . Columbia 's Dream Time Music by Paul Weston offers Embraceable You , Over the Rainbow , Why Should n't I ? , etc. , with a disheveled , shirtless brunette striding through a misty landscape . <P> A parallel trend : collections of broody " theme " music , some of it specially composed . Capitol Records has several brisk-selling numbers in this department , one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hate , Lust , Terror , Jealousy and Joy . On the jacket : the picture of a lush young woman lost in a mixture of subthemes . <P> <P> Capitol Records pioneered five years ago with a Hollywood-designed item called Music Out of the Moon . It was about as distinctive as a movie sound track , but it was decorated with a photograph of a half-covered girl and billed as " music that can affect the sensitive mind in a way that is sometimes frightening . . . always fascinating . " Its sales exceeded all expectations . After that , most major labels got busy . <P> Last week Billboard listed Capitol 's Music for Lovers Only ( produced by TV Funnyman Jackie Gleason ) as No. 1 best-selling popular album , leading more sedately covered LPs by such favorites as Doris Day , Eddie Fisher , Eartha Kitt and Liberace . In general , sales of all the gaudily decorated albums are going strong . Record executives take satisfaction in the thought that they are just giving the public what it wants .
