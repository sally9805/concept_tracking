Movie theater owners , who have long warned that films on television are destroying Hollywood , got some startling statistical support last week . The bad news , contained in a report on movie-going by Business Analysts Sindlinger &; Co. : since the TV screens last fall started to flicker for fair with movies , average weekly theater attendance has dropped 7,000,000 from 1956 figures , and theater owners have taken a $50 million loss at the box office . <P> For theater owners , 1957 started well enough . Average weekly attendance was up as high as 6.2% in the first six months , compared to the previous year . Then a summer decline set in that was drastically accelerated by the fall deluge of television movies . In the last six months of 1957 , attendance fell as much as 17.5% below 1956 figures . Box-office business will probably get worse if post-1948 films are peddled to television in the same volume as their predecessors . Some 300 post-1948 movies have already been sold down the channel , including such quality films as High Noon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a death blow to theaters and production . " <P> Some theater owners still take heart from the rising revenues of big-budget films released late in 1957 ( Sayonara , The Bridge on the River Kwai ) , urge Hollywood to lay off the potboilers and shoot the works on the big movie . Exactly , says Veteran Independent Samuel Goldwyn ( Guys and Dolls ) . Goldwyn believes that within a year Hollywood will be producing only half as many pictures as now , but adds , " They will be better pictures , " sees the industry heading for a " healthier condition than it has ever known .
