CAMBRIDGE 'S WINNING CREW , the first British eight ever to race in the US is here lining up to receive mementos of its four-length victory over Yale last week on Connecticut 's Housatonic River . Cambridge earned its trip to the U.S. after a lopsided ( 15-length ) victory over Oxford , its traditional British rival ( TIME , April 2 ) , will get a chance to prove its mettle against stiffer competition this week at Cambridge ( Mass ) , where it meets Harvard , M.I.T. ( Eastern sprint champs ) and Boston University !
