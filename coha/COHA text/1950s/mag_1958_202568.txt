State legislatures and city council chambers across the U.S. regularly ring with politicians ' warnings against " increasing concentration of power in Washington . " The truth is that the main power of government-to spend money-is being claimed by legislatures and city councils at breakdown rate . Since World War II the states have increased their spending 15 times faster than the Federal Government ; . city governments have increased a hefty 18 times faster . In fiscal 1957 alone , reports U.S. Census Bureau after a year of figure collecting , cities upped total expenditures 13% to an awesome $12.8 billion . . By comparison , federal spending for 1957 nondefense , domestic items was $24.2 billion . <P> Much of the new municipal money , poured into overcrowded streets and schools , was scrounged from an average 12.5% rise in sales taxes , an 11% hike in debts . And many state legislatures and city councils are girding themselves for record inchings-up in tax rates next year .                   @ @
