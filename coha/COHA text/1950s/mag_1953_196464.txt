Behind locked doors last week , directors of Manhattan 's Equitable Life Assurance Society met to perform an unpleasant job : the ouster of Chairman Thomas I. Parkinson , 71 . They did not have much choice . State Superintendent of Insurance Alfred J. Bohlinger , who had brought out a report charging Parkinson with " nepotism " in handling the society 's affairs ( TIME , Nov. 9 ) , threatened to get a court order to remove Parkinson . After twelve hours of debate , the board found a face-saving way to satisfy the state 's insurance superintendent , allow Parkinson to get his retirement pay ( $34,836 the first year , $29,868 the second , and $24,900 thereafter ) . They passed a resolution " confirming " Parkinson 's decision to retire ( made before the trouble started but since withdrawn ) , effective when his term as chairman expires next February .
