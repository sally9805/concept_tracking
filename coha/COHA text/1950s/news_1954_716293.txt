txt WASHINGTON , May 22 ? Congress is being flooded with mail , but on a subject far removed from the McCarthy-Army hearings that hold the headlines . The letter writers by the thouisands daily are demanding that ' Congress amend the pledge of allegiance so that the pledge is made to " one nation under God , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all " rather than to one , nation indivisible , with liberty and justice for all . " In response to the great influx of letters , the Senate , without dissent , adopted a resolution this week to effect the change and Lien sent the legislation speeding to the House of Representatives . There a similar resolution already had been acted upon favorably by a Judiciary subcommittee . Full committee action is expected shortly . The sponsor of the bill approved by the Senate is Senator Homer Ferguson of Michigan , chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee . He introduced the bill on Feb. 10 of this year , just three days after the change was urged in a Lin- ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastor of Proposal to Change It Draws Heavy Mail On Capitol Hill the New York Avenue Presbyterian . Church here , where President Eisenhower worships . Dr. Docherty , with the President in attendance on that occasion , had said : " There is something missing in the pledge , something that . is ? * * the characteristic and definitive factor in the American way of life . " Indeed , apart from the mention of the phrase ' the United States of America , ' it . could be the pledge of any republic . In fact , I could hear little Muscovites repeat a similar pledge to their hammer-and-sickle flag in ' Moscow . Russia is also a republic that claims to have overthrow the tyranny of kingship . Russia also claims to be indivisible . " The resolution thereupon of fered by Senator Ferguson broughlt a flood of praise , addressed not only to him but to other members of both houses .

Over on the House side Where fifteen such resolutions have been introduced , it was Representative Louis C. Rahaut , Democrat of Michigan , who offered the granddaddy of them all . On April 20 , 1953 , he dropped his resolution in the hopper at the suggestion of H. Joseph Mahoney of Brooklyn , N. Y. In a postscript on a letter to Mr. Rabaut , Mr. Mahoney wrote : " Why do n't you recommend the addition to the pledge of allegiance of the words ' under God . ' " The suggestion impressed Mr. Rabaut greatly because these were the very words found in Abraham Lincoln 's Gettysburg Address . He dropped in a bill . It was an immediate success . " It will make the nation more aware of its spirtual heritage " wrote one supporter of the pledge change . " Failure to acknowledge a Supreme Being is one of the principal causes of world unrest , " said another . " The nation 's strength will grow by this fuller acknowledgement , of its faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York muss . Senator Horner Ferguson For every letter in which the writer sought to express his own personal feeling on the subject , there were scores that just urged either support of the change in the pledge . All of the various sponsors , RS well as the Rev. Mr. Docherty , agree on one thing : the widespread support the bill is receiving must bear testimony to 3 , religious revival of significance .
