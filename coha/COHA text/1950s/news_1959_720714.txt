txt The members of Congress who are blocking President Eisenhower 's request for an end to the ** rate ceiling on the Government 's longerterm bonds have managed to push the rates on such obligations lower than they might otherwise he . But not in the way they think . A glance at the list of quotations and yields on Federal bonds available each day on the fourth from last page of this newspaper shr ' s the highest returns on the short-term issues and the lowest returns on the long-dated bonds . For instance , on one recent day bonds due in 1961 yielded ** those due in 1966 ** those due in 1980 ** and those due in 1995 3.9 " " r . In contrast , bonds offered the same day by the State of Connecticut and the County of Allegheny in Pennsylvania showed the opposite trend . The Connecticut yields ranged from ** for 1961 obligations , up to 3'itr .. for those beyond 1982 . The Allegheny yields ranged from 3 ' . for 1961 to 1.3 ' . for 1996 . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues than on the Federal bonds are due to the fact ' they are tax-free , but this freedom does n't affect how the yields vary with maturities . What affects how the yields vary with maturities is the market 's demand for various dated bonds . The range of yields on the state and county bonds reflects accurately what investors want . At present they want a bigger return when they lend their money out for many years than when they lend it out for just a few years . We know this to be true because there is no artificial rule or law governing the variation of yields on those nonFederal issues . If ins estors wanted the ladder of yields to lean the other way , the bonds would he offered to them that other way . But the Federal yields do slant the other way because the legal ceiling forces them into that pattern . This law I succeeds in doing so because the U.S Treasury can not sell any bonds that come due in five years or more . In ? estors know , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited , so they pay a premium on any such issues now outstanding , by accepting lower yields on them than on shorter issues . Some might suggest that since the 1995 Federal bond is at a 3.9 ' . yield the Treasury can issue bonds of that maturity below the ** rate ceiling . The answer is that if the Treasury PN en hinted it might offer such bonds , their potential supply would he increased , their price would fall and their yield would rise up to or past the ceiling . Thus the Congressional preservers of the ceiling have , it is true , richly succeeded in keeping down the rates on the longer-term issues of the Government . But it 's an empty triumph , because Uncle Sam ca n't take advantage of the low rates . Indeed , his borrowings , at present confined by the law 's prohibition to short-term issues , cost him more than ** It is still the market , not Congress , that dictates Uncle Sam 's borrowing costs .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
