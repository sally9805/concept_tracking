Planning a big midnight vice raid last week on the dock area , Brooklyn 's District Attorney Edward S. Silver called in the press for an advance briefing , with the understanding that the story would be held until the roundup began . But United Press International , which did not staff Silver 's briefing , was told about the raid by a " responsible police official . " who set the release date at 10 p.m . Out on the U.P.I , wire in time for 10 o'clock radio newscasts clacked word of Silver 's sortie , a full two hours before the cops were due to swoop . <P> Within minutes after the news was broadcast , the prostitutes , pimps , pickpockets and pot peddlers who were to be the raid 's targets started clearing out of the area . When the police arrived at midnight , the dock country was as quiet as a park after a Sunday-school picnic . Rummaging through one hotel , cops found a sailor bedded down with a woman , but she claimed she was a bride , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt , the raiders were reduced to little more than issuing a summons for an uncovered garbage can . <P> But the U.P.I. 's grief was nothing compared to the tabloid New York Mirror 's gaffe . Relying on the advance briefing , the Mirror assumed that the raid had run according to form , made it the banner story ( lOO POLICE RAID B'KLYN VICE DENS ) , and hit the street next morning playing the farce for fact .
