The Truman Administration is under attack on charges of two kinds of corruption : 1 ) the garden or influence-peddling variety , and 2 ) even more serious allegations of ideological corruption that led to failures of foreign policy . Last week , while the Republican National Committee was hurting that party 's chances of walloping the Democrats on the first count , a Senate subcommittee headed by a Democrat , Pat McCarran of Nevada , brought in a highly damaging report against the Administration on the second . <P> The McCarran subcommittee , set up by Congress in December 1950 , plunged immediately into a complex inquiry : Was the Institute of Pacific Relations infiltrated by Communists and their sympathizers ? If so , how much control did the I.P.R. exert on U.S. public opinion and U.S. Far Eastern policy ? <P> Last week , after 17 months of study and hearing , involving 66 witnesses and thousands of documents , the McCarran committee gave its answer . A 226-page report , packed with fascinating quotations from witnesses and documentary exhibits , boiled down to a crushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . that the I.P.R. has been , in general , neither objective nor nonpartisan , and concludes further that , at least since the mid-1930s , the net effect of the I.P.R. activities on United States public opinion has been pro-Communist and proSoviet , and has frequently and repeatedly been such as to serve international Communist , Chinese Communist , and Soviet interests , and to subvert the interests of the United States . , . " <P> Loaded for Bear . The McCarran committee , unlike the Tydings committee , which preceded it and which seemed more interested in belittling subversion than in pinning it down , was loaded for bear . But McCarran 's counsel , Robert Morris , rigorously avoided star-chamber or headline-hunting procedures , sifted evidence for fairness in secret executive sessions . <P> The committee found : <P> 54 persons connected in various ways with I.P.R. were identified by witnesses as participants in " the Communist world conspiracy against democracy . " <P> 14 men &; women connected with I.P.R. had refused to say whether they were Communists on the ground that their answers might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frederick Vanderbilt Field . <P> 25 men &; women connected with I.P.R. and involved by evidence in pro-Communist activities were out of reach ( abroad , dead , in hiding , etc , ) of subpoena . Included : Gunther Stein , Agnes Smedley , Andrew Roth . <P> A small core of I.P.R. officials and staffers , who were proCommunist , also carried the main burden of I.P.R. activities behind a screen of non-Communist officials and contributors to the institute . To the I.P.R. protest that most writing in the institute 's periodicals was nonCommunist , the committee answered : " NonCommunist or ' neutral writing ' plus . . . pro-Communist writing means , whatever the exact percentages , a net pro-Communist effect . . .
