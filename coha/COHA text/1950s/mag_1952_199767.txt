Two 's Company ( music &; lyrics by Vernon Duke &; Ogden Nash ; sketches by Charles Sherman &; Peter De Vries ) brought Bette Davis back to Broadway after some 20 years in Hollywood . But even with her return to the stage marking her first real fling as a comic , it all proved more an occasion than an event . Though Two 's Company is not up to sound revue standards , it would very likely prove a satisfying evening if Actress Davis were up to her role . She struggles valiantly , but a big-time revue is too new to her , and comedy does n't come natural . <P> She is on the stage a lot : she is Sadie Thompson , she is Tallulah cavorting at Bette Davis show , she is a hillbilly singer on TV , a straight singer of musicomedy songs , the slavey wife of a jealous , roughneck husband . She is not at all a dead weight : she knows how to command attention . But it 's all a little like watching someone stay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little as if two famous actresses were exchanging roles , and that , to complete the joke , Ethel Merman should turn up as Hedda Gabler . With Bette Davis not pacing the show , Two 's Company alternately spurts and slumps . There are such pleasant-enough Vernon Duke tunes as It Just Occurred to Me - though it could have occurred to a good many composers . There are a number of skits with promising ideas , but few that are even reasonably funny . Dave Burns is an enjoyable comic , and Hiram Sherman-even without good material-an ingratiating commentator . Most notably , Jerome Robbins has worked out some attractive dances and ballets , and Ballerina Nora Kaye contributes some attractive dancing . But somehow all these names do n't add up to very much news .
