txt London 's historic Bow Street Court heard today the story of how , the United States and Britain believe , the essential facts about the most closely guarded strategic secret of our time  --  the atomic bomb  --  reached Soviet Russia . The court heard a confession , said by the prosecutor to have been made by a scientific genius who sought refuge here from Hitler 's Nazi Germany and then leiwloyalty to communism lead him to treason over a period of seven years against the country that had adopted him . The man in the dock accused of a betrayal , the consequences of which may well change die course of history , was a bespectacled , insignificant-looking man of 38 years , named Klaus Fuchs , who had been snatched from a British internment camp in 1942 and catapulted into the center of atomic research projects here and in the United States . Guided by Conscience According to the confession , which , it was said , had been made voluntarily , he had so schooled his disciplined mind that he could swear allegiance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any qualm of conscience . The document termed it " controlled schizophrenia . " His mental processes , as depicted in this strange document were as fantastic as the scientific miracles that his brain helped to bring into being . It was a confession such as might have come from behind the Iron Curtain . In it , Dr. Fuchs said , according to the prosecution , that in betraying atomic secrets he was acting in accordance with the dictates of his conscience and in the interest of humanity . He had accepted ? 100 in cash from foreign agents , he said , but he had done so only as a token of his subservience to communism . His confession , part of which was impounded and part read in open court , implicated the Soviet Embassy in London and Communist party members here as links in a chain of espionage that spread from here to the . United States and back again . The story will be developed in detail at a trial , which was set for the Feb. 28 sessions of the Old Bailey Criminal Court as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charges In the statement introduced in evidence today as Dr. Fuchs ' voluntary confession , he was quoted as saying that he was a creature " made by circumstances . " His statement , or the part of it that was read in court , was that of a tortured soul with the will to do right and the genius to bring new wonders to the world , but without the wit and maturity to deal sensibly with the simpler problems of right and.wrong or to decide where in this complex modern civilization his loyalties ? should lie . Dr. Fuchs stood accused specif- . icaIly of betraying atomic secrets to Russian and perhaps other foreign agents in the United States in 1945 and in Britain in 1947 . But if his confession is to be credited , he started giving away secrets of. , atomic research in 1942 and only , quit about one year ago when he , , began to question , whether Premier Stalin 's policies were really in harmony with his own ideas about the true mission of communism in this world , In connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , worth noting that Nazi terrorism , drove him to this country for asylum long before the war broke out . At the time he started telling the secrets of atomic research to Russian agents , as he is charged with doing , . Russia and the Communist Claque in . Britain were agitating for a " second front " against Germany , and many people , high and low , in Britain and the United States , were vying with one another to show friendship for the gallant allies who were liquidating the Wehrmacht so effectively . By the time Dr. Fuchs began to take a second thought he was in distinguished company . According to one witness against him  --  a security officer'named William James Skardon ? Dr. Fuchs broke with the Russians of today as easily as he had betrayed Britain and the United States in the interest of communism a few , years ago . He still believed in communism , however , Mr. Skardon said Dr. Fuchs had told him . " He said he still believed in communism , " said Mr. Scardon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form he thinks it is something to fight against . He said he had never been a member of the British Communist party . He said he had decided recently that he could only settle in England and that , he had been- terribly worried about the impact of his behavior upon his friendship with various people * ** " But , said Mr. Skardon , Dr. Fuchs had also said that when he was ' naturalized in 1942 and took the oath of allegiance to ' Britain , seriously as he took his oath , he asserted the right to act in accordance with his conscience and follow first his loyalty to humanity as a whole . The story really begins in 1933 , when Dr. Fuchs , a brilliant young scientist who had gone underground as a Communist in Hitler 's Germany , fled to France and then to Britain . He was then a prodigy of twenty-two years . There is a blank here in his record , as it was , revealed in court today . But , in 1940 , after the fall of France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1942 when. , a drive was on for physicists who knew something about nuclear fission , he was offered his freedom for his knowledge . No sooner did Dr. Fuchs learn the nature of the research on which he was to work than he got in touch with a Communist acquaintance with the aim of making the results of his work known to Russia . First he talked only of what he knew himself , the court was told , but later he transmitted the result of his colleagues ' . work as well . And according to T. Christmas Humphreys , the prosecutor , he was one of the " best theoretical physicists living . " Contacts in 11 5. and Britain There were bimonthly - meetings with . foreign agents for transmission of up-to-the-minute information in London , at the atomic research plant at Los Alamos , N. M. , and in Boston , - it was charged . There was even one visit to the Soviet Embassy in London , according to the , evidence . According to the evidence , Dr. Fuchs took money on one occasion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was apparent , was not for mercenary reasons , but solely as a token of his subservience to the cause of communism . His real reason for the betrayal , he said , was loyalty to his ideological convictions . Throughout his career of treachery , Dr. Fuchs was said to have told his confessors that he knew that he was taking his " life in his hands , " but that this was nothing new to him , as he had had an early apprenticeship in the underground of Nazi Germany . In the confession that the prosecution asserts Dr. Fuchs made he expressed more concern abou* what his friends at Harwell , Brit ish atomic , research center , when- , he had been since 1946 , would think of his ? behavior than he did remorse over the consequences to the . World of his treasonable behavior . A leader in the social ac- tivities of the isolated - community at Harwell , he was popular with his fellow scientists . This , and ? other quirks of the prisoner 's mind , prompted the folIlowing comment from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly be unique and create a new precedent in the world of psychology . It is clear that we have half of his mind beyond the reach of reason and the impact of facts . The other half - lived in a world of normal relationships and friendships with his colleagues and human loyalty . " ' Mr. Humphreys said that this " dual personality " of the prisoner had been " consciously and deliberately produced . " Dr. Fuchs , , he said , had deliberately split his mind in two to prodUce " controlled schizophrenia . " Jekyll-Hyde Personality " It will be seen , " the prosecutor continued , " that he produced in himself a classical example of that immortal duality of English literature ? a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde . As Jekyll , he was as a normal citizen will be in the use of a magnificent brain in the cause of science . As Hyde , he was betraying , week by week , his oath of allegiance , his vows of security and the friendship of his friends . " He seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown to all about him , he was a political fanatic on the payroll of a foreign power . " Suspicion centered upon Dr. Fuchs some time ago and an investigation was started both here and in the United States by the Federal Bureau of Investigation . Whether Dr. ' Fuchs knew about this was not- clear . But last October he volunteered information that his father , a professor , had been moved from a university in. the United States zone of Germany to one in Leipzig in the Russian zone . He thought that under the circumstances the British authorities might like him to resign . He was questioned at intervals after that and finally on Jan. 26 he broke down , it was said , and confessed that he had for years been supplying Russia with secret information . Mr. Humphreys quoted this remarkable portion of Dr. Fuchs ' statement in evidence : " I used my Marxian philosophy to conceal my thoughts in two compartments . One side was the man I wanted to be . I could be free and easy and happy with other people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compartment would step in if I reached a danger point . It appeared to me at the time that I had become a free man because I had succeeded in the other compartment in establishing myself completely independent of the surrounding forces , of society . " When the hearing ended the blinking prisoner was led off by policemen to Brixton prison to await his trial next month for violating Britain 's Official Secrets Act and perhaps extradition to the United States for another trial . If convicted here , he faces a sentence of up to fourteen years ' imprisonment .
