GO ... pg . 23 Letters to The Times Civil Rights Bill Scope of Measure Said to Be Evident in Its Four Parts The writer of the following letter was formerly special assistant to the Attorney General of the United States and assistant.so/icitor in the Department of Interior , To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK Trim : In The Times ' lead editorial for July 11 entitled " The Right-to-Vote Bill " it is stated that " The principal protagonists of , the bill in Congress " have never regarded the Administration 's civil rights bill " as - anything more than a bill to insure to , every American citizen the right to vote in Federal elections . " The editorial concludes that it should now be made clear " that this bill deals exclusively with voting rights , which is what almost everybody had thought all along it deals with . " The Administration 's civil rights bill consists of four parts , each separately entitled in boldface type . As the titles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the establishment of a " Commission on Civil Rights "  --  and the appointment of an additional Assistant Attorney General . Part III , ? according to its title , is intended " To Strengthen the Civil Rights Statutes , and for Other Purposes . " The title of Part IV reads : " To Provide Means of Further Securing and Protecting the Right to Vote . " Accordingly , the " principal protagonists of the bill in Congress " needed only to read the four titles of their bill to see that it relates not only to the right to vote , but also to other matters . And they need not have read very far into the text of Part III to see that it provides for Federal injunctive proceedings to protect citizens ' rights , regardless of race , to equal protection of the laws and equal privileges and immunities under law . Injunctive Proceedings Under the Supreme Court 's decisions these rights and privileges now include that of desegregated public ' education , If any of the legislative protagonists were in doubt that the bill envisaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports on the bill , and Attorney " General Brownell 's testimony , should have set their doubts at rest . Congressional protagonists of legislation are expected to meet higher standards of familiarity with the contents of proposed legislation than would apply to the average citizen . Nevertheless , I am puzzled by the editorial comment that " almost everybody " had thought the bill dealt " exclusively with voting rights . " The text of the bill has received wide , publicity , and the four titles are all that is necessary to dispel the misapprehension , The New ' York Times Magazine for June 16 carried the writer 's article entitled " Crux of the . Civil Rights Debate , " the very first paragraph of which noted that the bill would authorize the Attorney General to " obtain Federal court injunctions * * * to eliminate segregation in the school system , " and the balance of which described the breadth of the bill 's scope , not only for the protection of voting rights but also to promote equal access to public facilities . The editorial gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion that the bill should now be limited to the protection of voting rights . With all deference ; it seems to the writer that the purpose of the bill has been plain enough . from the outset , and that these reasons- are far from being sufficient to justify such radical surgery . TELFORD TAYLOR . New York . Juiv 12. 1957 . Support ' Urged for - France To THE EDITOR OFTHE NEW YORK TIMES : Much as I admire . Henri Pierre 's objectivity - regarding Senator Kennedy 's speech on Algeria ; I doubt if his letter to The Times of July 7 will - help to-enlighten ' opinion here on the ' Algerian question .. Neither the Senator nor his advocatus diaboli has mentioned the essence of the problem , to ignore which is to put in ' jeopardy the very survival of France , . of - Europe and of the United States . They did not mention panrArabism , of which the Algerian. trbuble is but an episode and the . Moscow-Cairo axis an ominous portent : Have , we so soon forgotten pan-Germanism and its ravages ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us ? of ' the free world . Unfortunately for her , this is not the first time she has been called upon to assume a tragic and thankless mission . She deserves understanding and support . S. M. DELsoN .. New York , July 10 , 1937 .. For Smaller Schools To THE EDITOR car THE Nsw YORK TImEs It was most gratifying to read in The , Times of July 8 that the New York City Board of Education will build an elementary school on Second Avenue and . Fifty-seventh Street that will house not more than 600 children . The over-large schools that we have in. our city make it almost impossible to achieve our educational objective ? the all-around development of the children . . Last summer .1 visited London . It was a plearmre to see schools with only ten classes . The intimacy that pervaded those schools made a world of difference between them and the schools in our city . Small schools could go a long way in solving our educational and our delinquency problems . A small school means warmth , friendship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education is to be commended for its tremendous building program . It is to be hoped that the school authorities will now give thought to the building of more small schools such as the one planned in midManhattan . They are the ? best investment that our city can make . PETER MALCOLM BROOKS . Brooklyn , July 13 , 1957 . Program for Arab Refugees Forcible Transfer Involved in Plan for Resettlement Criticized The writer of the following letter is chairman of the Department of Near Eastern Languages and Literature - at Yale University . To THE EDITOR OF THE New York TIMES : Senator Hubert Humphrey 's concern for the problem of the Palestinian-Arab refugees and his desire to do something about it are laudable and encouraging . Unfortunately , like most American thinking on this subject , his proposals begin a : . the wrong end . Like the plans for utilizing the . water of the Jordan , they fail to take account of the human realities of the situation . Was it the people of Iraq and Syria who told Senator Humphrey that they needed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And do the Palestinian refugees want to go there ? Thus far they give no indication of wanting to go anywhere . outside of Palestine , their homeland . Who then is going to move them ? Shall we or the United Nations send armed forces to herd them into trucks and planes and transport them- across the desert ? Or will the Army of Jordan Undertake that dirty work ? We Americans are ' much too prone to talk about freedom and selfdetermination in general terms but at the same time try to deal with other people as mere counters to be manipulated . The Arab refugees are not just a material obstacle to security and stability , to-be moved out of the way . They are people , wronged and wretched men , women and children . Developing Economies A more realistic approach to the problem would be to help Iraq and Syria , if they want our help , to develop their economies to the point where they are ready for more peo-ple and can offer them attractive opportunities . If and when that happens , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be glad to move of their own accord . This . might take more time than a wholesale , forcible transfer of hundreds of thousands of persons . It would certainly be cheaper . It would also have another advantage : it would work . No resettlement project , however , can really solve the problem . Senator Humphrey is right on one point : Israel must readmit some of the refugees . But it must not be a mere token number . Just who would be fooled by that ? It must be in accord with the acts of the U. N. and simple justice , and this means that those who choose to return , accepting the inevitable conditions of living in Israel and becoming loyal , even if second-class , citizens , must be readmitted . Probably not many would want to go back if they knew what it would involve . But the only alternative to accepting those who choose to return is a cession-of sufficient territory by Israel to permit those who insist on remaining in Palestine to do so without being admitted to Israel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not by an American loan , must be a real compensation for individual losses , not a lump contribution to the expenses of resettling the refugees . MILLAE BURROWS . New Haven , Conn. , July 6 , 1957 . Forming of Corporations TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The legal requirement that corporations be formed by at least three incorporators is an anachronism . A few centuries ago , when corporations were first developed , they were almost always group ventures . Today , of course , that is very frequently not the case . But to bring a corporation into being time and money Mug be wasted in having three , people sign a variety of documents forming the corporation , recording a fictitious meeting , resigning their offices and assigning their subscriptions . Legislation should be enacted to permit one person to form a corporation , and to dispense with this useless hocus pocus . SIMEON H. F. GOLDSTEIN . New York , July 11 , 1957 . Cost of Medicines Protested To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I am very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Quite a number of people have complained of medicines costing $5 or $10 or $18 a bottle , and they are in despair . Surely such prices are- too high . As a matter of fact , often druggists do not charge the same price for the same medicines . Is there anything that can be done about this ? A. G. New York , July 10 , 1957.
