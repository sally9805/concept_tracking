It was straight , stock-in-trade western fare . From all over the courtroom , angry cattlemen glowered at the captured rustler . And the rustler himself , a bull-necked hombre who liked heavy gambling and fancy women , was perfectly cast . All that marred the illusion was the scene of the trial-not Dodge City but Dsseldorf-and the repeated references to the rustler 's favorite steed : a Mercedes 300 limousine . <P> On the face of the evidence , it was hard to see why Master Butcher Albert Roden , 50 , chief defendant in last week 's trial of " the King of German Cattle Thieves , " had ever turned to rustling at all . For years , his butcher shop on Dsseldorf 's Rethelstrasse , manned by his two sons and his bleached-blonde wife , Anna , had been grossing $2,000 a week . But as the trial progressed , a painfully familiar story emerged : in 1951 on a jaunt to nearby Bad Neuenahr Casino , Roden caught the roulette bug , began to drop as much as $1,200 at a session . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill for nearly $8,000 in back taxes , Roden , unable to pay , remembered the dying days of World War II , when he kept his retreating Wehrmacht unit in meat by slaughtering cattle in the open fields of East Prussia . With Ewald Mischker , 48 , a Dsseldorf stockyard worker , as his accomplice , Roden began to prey on the North German range . <P> The Gunman . Cruising the Autobahnen by daylight in Roden 's Mercedes , the butcher and his sidekick spotted likely herds of beef cattle grazing near the highways . Returning by night , Roden would cover his well-cut suit with a butcher 's apron , work a steer or heifer out of the herd , and stun it with an airgun slug . Then , slaughtering and quartering the animal in less than half an hour , Roden would stow his kill in the trunk and back seat of the Mercedes and race back to Dsseldorf . There in the morning , he offered his customers fresh cuts of beef , complete with faked , blue government-inspection stamps . <P> Though Roden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not quit . For more than six years he averaged a raid a week , stealing in all some 400 cattle , worth $90,000 . Even after giving Mischker his cut , Roden had enough left over to finance his roulette losses and to set up a beauty parlor for his girl friend , Widow Irmgard Wakulenko , 38 . <P> Farewell , Old Pal . Early last year , Mischker began to harp uneasily on an old German proverb : " The pitcher goes to the well until it breaks . " To replace Mischker , the insatiable Roden enlisted his 22-year-old son Jrgen , but on Jrgen 's second night out with Father , a motorcycle cop , suspicious at the sight of so young a man driving so expensive a car , came over to investigate and spotted the beef in the back seat . With the pitcher plainly broken at last , Roden confessed all , and last week , as his trial wound to a close , he was clearly headed for the kindest fate a rustler can expect : a long stretch in prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state prosecutor was demanding confiscation of Rustler Roden 's trusty Mercedes .
