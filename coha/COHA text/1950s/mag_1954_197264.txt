A slender , hard-faced man , outwardly calm and obviously used to authority , stood last week in the governor 's office in Bacolod , capital of Negros Occidental Province , and heard himself sentenced to death . At this , an insignificant-looking woman , the mother of his victim smiled wanly and said : " Now I know that justice is for the rich and poor alike . " <P> In 1951 Rafael Lacson was the undisputed boss of Negros Occidental , second most populous province in the Philippines . He sat in the governor 's chair and , allied with the big sugar planters , ran a tight police state . The province 's 200.000 voters did as Lacson bade and so did the under paid farm workers . If anyone stepped out of line in Negros Occidental , he answered either to the planters ' private armies or to Lacson 's own bullet-hard , radio-equipped constabulary . In 1949 a few foreign correspondents flew in to inspect this little dictatorship ; Governor Lacson turned them right around and flew them out . Occasionally , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but nothing ever came of it . Even if he was a bit rough , he delivered solidly on election day . President Quirino 's Liberal administration could not afford to quibble . <P> Campaign Issue . But in 1951 a nobody named Moises Padilla invaded Lacson 's territory by running as opposition candidate for mayor of Magallon . Lacson sent word to Padilla to drop out . Usually this sufficed ; instead Padilla , an old guerrilla fighter against the Japanese , appealed to Ramon Magsaysay. then Defense Secretary , for protection . Magsaysay also worked for Liberal President Quirino , but Magsaysay had no use for Lacson 's little dictatorship . The army protected Padilla . <P> Padilla lost the election , of course . That night Lacson 's uniformed bully boys picked him up and took him on an impromptu road show . They toured from town to town beating and torturing Padilla , displaying him in a public square while one of the boys announced : " Here is what happens to people who oppose us . " Once Padilla saw his mother and managed to mumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negros Occidental , he found Padilla 's body , broken and dripping blood onto a police bench with 14 bullets in the back . Lacson smiled easily : " Shot dead in an attempt to make his getaway . " <P> Magsaysay 's men uncovered enough evidence to indict Lacson and 26 henchmen for murder . The trial began in January 1952. but for one reason or another , during Quirino 's presidency , it was frequently interrupted ( during one interlude , Lacson was convicted of raping his housemaid and sentenced to eight years ) . But the Padilla case was not forgotten . In his campaign for the presidency last year , Magsaysay would climax his speeches by declaring emotionally : " When I carried the body of Moises Padilla in my arms , it was not the body of Padilla but the body of the humble people of my country .
