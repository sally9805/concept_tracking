DAYPART FIVE By DAVID HOWARTH OMAHA BEACH Pk . Henry Meyers had never wanted to be called up . The draft had interrupted his recent marriage and his plan to be a teacher and the placid life he enjoyed among all the bustle of New York . The Army had wrenched him away from all that and discovered he was a mathematician and made him , by Army logic , into a signaler . Of course , he knew the necessity for Army service , and he had done his best at it ; but he wanted to get it over as quickly as he could and go home and start teaching In June of when Henry Meyers ' unit had been packed on hoard a troopship and told that this was really the invasion , he had been glad . They would land in France , at a place called Omaha Beach , and this was the quickest way to end the war . He could not sec much from his position in the boat , wedged in among taller men . He could not move much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was carrying a heavy coil of telephone wire over his shoulder . There was a tremendous noise as the boat came nearer to the beach , infinitely worse than the practice runs with live ammunition . In thelast few seconds , above the ramp of the boat , he saw shellbursts ; then he heard the splatter of bullets on the ramp itself . Then the boat grounded , the ramp went down , the men in front ran forward , and Meyers jumped into the sea . At last he could see what was going on . Men in front of him were falling face down in the water and making no effort to rise . On the edge of the sea where the waves were breaking he could see bundles washing in and out , rolling over and over  --  bodies . Beyond , he could see the wide sandy beach and bodies lying there , too , and a tank burning , men clinging to its shelter like a cluster of bees . Here and there the beach was erupting in sprays of sand and debris where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullets ran across and across it like wicked living things . Far away up the beach was a high bank of stones , and behind that in the smoke were low hills , flashing with tire . And the noise was so terrible that he could not think : His brain stopped dead . Instinct would not allow him to run up the beach . Instead , he turned right and ran along the water 's edge , splashing through the little rims of foam , the rifle and the coil of wire jolting awkwardly on his shoulder . He had an impulse to throw the wire away  --  hut the wire was what he was there for , and they would be stuck without it . He stopped for a second , every inch of his body expecting the horrible whack of a bullet ; and then he started to run up the beach . Things came into the little circle of his vision as he ran  --  a German obstacle , a mangled body , blood , wreck age , rifles , torn equipment . He ran on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the dry sand ; and then a high bank of stones  --  big stones , like cannon balls . Men were lying elbow to elbow , hugging the steep face of the bank for cover or squatting in holes in the sand , some wounded . He dropped down there . Above the dreadful noise he heard thin screams , and shouts which might have been orders , but if they were he could not understand them , and nobody moved . What ought a good soldier to do ? The answer could only be to keep alive , if you can , till they need you . So he started to dig , first throwing down his coil of wire . There it lay , half a mile of it , and something must have gone wrong , he thought . He was meant to go on and lay the wire to some place inland  --  but nobody had even been able to cross the high bank of stones . He was right ; almost everything had gone wrong . At that moment the landing on Omaha was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last shreds of courage . In calm analysis the causes which led to this situation can be listed : the weather was bad , the bombardment had failed , the beach gave advantages to the defense , the German forces manning it were better troops than the planners expected , and finally  --  though this may be still a matter of opinion  --  there were basic mistakes in the plans . But the men who were suffering on the beach that morning were aware of only two of these causes  --  the weather and the formidable hills they were expected to assault . Omaha Beach is five miles long and , like Utah Beach , it slopes so gently that the tide runs out for 300 or 400 yards . But that is its only resemblance to Utah . Behind it , instead of dunes and flat meadows , there is the bank of stones which Henry Meyers reached and then a stretch of marshy land and then grassy hills or bluffs. 150 feet high  --  easy to climb , but too steep for trucks or tanks . At each end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which extend for miles . There are four small valleys in the bluffs , with trees and bushes in them . Except for one isolated gap at Port-enBessin , the four valleys were the only possible ways for a mechanized army to move inland on the whole stretch of twenty miles of coast from the mouth of the Vire River to the village of Arromanches . On flat beaches like Utah , the Germans had to build their pillboxes and emplacements close to the edge of the sand ; attacking infantry could get to grips with them quickly . But on Omaha the gun positions were built on the sides of the bluffs . Overlooking the beach , they had enormous fields of fire . To reach them , infantry would have to cross the beach itself , the stone bank  --  which had barbed wire on top  --  and the flat strip behind it , which was mined ; then they would have to climb the slopes . For all of this journey they would be plainly visible to German gunners on the bluffs , except in the couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The entire beach was covered by heavy guns protected on the seaward side by fifteen to twenty feet of concrete  --  over sixty pieces of artillery , besides mortars and a large number of machine guns . In addition to these defenses , the Germans had made great use on Omaha Beach of underwater obstacles . Near the low-water mark there was a row of large steel gates , braced by girders . Farther up the beach there were rows of wooden ramps and stout wooden posts with contact mines on top . Finally , on the upper part or the tidal Ilat , steel hedgehogs were scattered about . These were made of three lengths of angle iron welded together in the middle so that spikes struck up whichever side they lay on . The first step in the plan of attack was to remove the obstacles before the tide rose over them . According to the plan , H Hour was 6:30 a.m. , which was soon after low water . From 5:50 till 6:27. a tremendous naval bombardment had been arranged . From six o'clock till 6:25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Four minutes later sixty-four amphibious tanks were due to land ; at H Hour itself , thirty-two ordinary tanks and sixteen armored bulldozers ; and one minute later , eight companies of infantry-1450 men in thirty-six landing craft . Two minutes behind the infantry was a Special Demolition Task Force , to clear and mark lanes through the obstacles before the tide rose and covered them . A pause of half an hour was left in the planned landings to allow the demolition men to finish their work . Then bigger waves of infantry were due , with the first artillery units beginning to come in at eight o'clock . The demolition men were really the crux of this plan . There were 272 of them , and they would have a delicate and fiddling task in attaching explosive charges to the obstacles and connecting them with fuses and detonators . They would be too busy to protect themselves , so for defense they had to depend on the first wave of infantry and tanks . But 1450 men and ninety-six tanks would be no match for the German batteries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these plans was fulfilled . The air bombardment missed its targets , The naval shelling had little apparent effect on the defenses . Most of the tanks were lost at sea or quickly destroyed on the beach , and the infantry units were scattered and decimated . The demolition men lost nearly half their number almost at once , and the remainder struggled to carry out their orders under impossible conditions . The beach became a chaos ; the program of landing was abandoned . And this whole chain of disaster was started by the weather . There is no evidence that the cloud cover was worse at Omaha than at Utah . The difference between the air bombing on the two beaches was a difference in policy and aircraft . At Utah , medium bombers carried out the last-minute bombardment at low level ; at Omaha , the job was done by heavy bombers  --  Liberators  --  which could bomb through the clouds by instruments . On the basis of the weather forecast , the decision was taken to use instruments , which in those days was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a risk that the bombing would hit the landing craft . The air crews were therefore ordered to delay their drop after crossing the coast , the length of the delay to vary with the length of the time before H Hour . So the bombs fell at first a few hundred yards inland and crept farther away until just before H Hour , when they landed three miles beyond the beach . None of the bombs , except perhaps a few strays , fell near enough to the beach defenses to do harm . The results of the naval bombardment also were meager ; but this is not so simple to explain . The bombardment looked heavy on paper . There were two American battleships . Texas and Arkansas , three cruisers  --  one was British and two were Free French  --  and eight destroyers . They were to fire 3500 rounds of calibers from five to fourteen inches . Army artillery was mounted on landing craft so that it could fire while waiting to go in and was scheduled to fire 9000 rounds in the thirty minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each to fire 1000 high-explosive rockets . What happened to 21,500 projectiles ? There are many answers . Only a small proportion of the volume of fire was real naval gunnery . The rockets were notoriously inaccurate . The aiming of Army guns in small landing craft must have been uncertain , because the sea was rough . The morning was rather misty , and the beach was soon covered with smoke and dust , which made target spotting difficult . The Germans had made their emplacements almost impregnable to fire from seaward , and reconnaissance had not detected them all . Finally , the length of the shooting had been restricted to thirty-five minutes . When the troops started to cross the beach , the greater part of the German defenses was still intact and went into action . The weather caused its greatest havoc among the infantry landing craft and amphibious tanks . The wind was blowing at ten to eighteen knots from the northwest . At Utah the wind was offshore , and the closer one went to the beach the calmer the sea became . At Omaha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes six feet . Neither the landing craft nor the amphibious tanks were designed to work in such a rough sea . Amphibious tanks were a new invention then and were used on all the beaches . Those for Omaha were carried across the channel in sixteen landing craft commanded by Dean L. Rockwell , a Naval Reserve lieutenant . Rockwell , a professional wrestler from Detroit , had got into landing craft after joining the Navy as an instructor in physical education ; by the time he reached England , destined to take a front scat in the invasion of Europe , he commanded a flotilla . And then , in March , he was let in on the secret that amphibious tanks existed . His job was to study the technique of launching them from landing craft at sea . The idea of a tank which would float and propel itself in water had baffled engineers in every army . The solution of the problem is attributed to a Hungarian-born engineer named Nicholas Straussler , who was working in Britain . The Admiralty condemned his design as unseaworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as soon as Eisenhower and Montgomery saw it demonstrated , orders were given for hundreds of Sherman tanks to be converted . Straussler 's idea was to fasten a kind of canvas screen around an ordinary tank . Tubes in the canvas could be blown up like an air mattress , the canvas forming the sides of a boat and the tank itself forming the bottom . The tank 's engine was connected by extra clutches to two propellers . When the tank touched shore , the air could be let out of the tubes and the canvas collapsed , and within a couple of seconds the tank was in action . But no more unpleasant means of going into battle could be imagined . The top of the tank was several feet below water level . The tank commander could stand behind the turret , but the rest of the crew  --  driver , co-driver , radio operator and gunner  --  were down inside the tank . They knew that their thirty-five-ton vehicle was suspended from a flimsy structure which would collapse if punctured or be swamped by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them inside it . The channel crossing was hard for the landing-craft crews , perhaps harder for the tank crews . They finally sailed from Portland at 9:15 a.m. on June fifth , with a voyage of twenty hours in front of them . Most of the tank crews were seasick all the way . Between their bouts of sickness they speculated about the weather , wondering whether they would be able to launch their tanks at all . Rockwell 's orders were that if the sea was too rough for the tanks to swim , the landing craft should take them right in to the beach and land them . The sixteen craft were to divide , before they reached the area for launching , into two groups of eight craft each . The senior Navy officer and senior Army officer in each group were to make a joint decision whether to launch or not . Nobody had told them what to do if they disagreed . Nightfall on the stormy sea threw the convoy into confusion . At dawn , Rockwell was rather surprised to find all of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of the infantry transports anchored ten miles offshore and past the heavy ships which were waiting to open their bombardment . The groups divided , his own eight craft heading toward the western end of the beach , the others toward the east . When it was light enough to sec the waves , Rockwell was sure that the tanks would never survive launching . The senior Army officer of his group was in another craft . Prepared to argue , Rockwell called him on the radio . He was thankful to hear him echo his own thoughts : " I do n't think we can make it . Will you take us right in ' ? " Rockwell said he would . At that moment , in the early dawn , his ships were steamingeastward , waiting to launch . At 5:30 he gave the signal to beach and saw them all turn with perfect precision toward the shore , the van of the landing on Omaha . The other group decided to launch . Al the crucial moment , the order that the Army and Navy should share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each landing craft dropped its ramp , and on each of them four tanks moved forward to enter the water , Some of them went off the ramp successfully and traveled 100 yards or so before they abruptly vanished below the waves . Some never floated at all . There was a certain gallantry , however unwise , in the way they went . Commanders of the second , third and fourth tanks in each craft could see the leaders founder ; but the order had been given to launch , and they launched , one by one , each of them hoping for better luck . Once they had started , the Navy could not stop them , but only watch each tank till the moment when a wave broke over it , or the canvas collapsed , and the tank disappeared and nothing was left on the sea but one man swimming , perhaps two , but seldom more . Within two or three minutes , twenty-seven of the thirty-two tanks were at the bottom of the channel , and 135 men were drowned or swimming for their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink at once . The landing craft had lurched when this tank went off , and the second tank ran backward into the third and fourth , and all three of them tore their canvas so badly that they could not possibly have floated . The ensign commanding the landing craft decided on his own responsibility to make for the shore ; he went in all alone and landed the three tanks . Two other tanks reached the beach under their own power . The infantry on the eastern half of the beach thus had the support of five amphibious tanks out of the thirty-two they had expected . Rockwell did not see this tragic proof that his own decision had been right . His own eight craft were some distance to the westward , and he was intent on watching the beach ahead and the clock . Between 6:27 and 6:29 , while the tank landing craft stopped engines and grazed the sand of Omaha , there was a fleeting hope that the bombardment had done its work and the defenses had been destroyed . The ramp of Rockwell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into five feet of water and crawled ahead to the sand fifty yards away , the water washing over its back and pouring off again . In that same moment the Germans came to life . Rockwell saw the muzzle flashes from casemates on the bluffs . His second tank got away . Then three landing craft on his right were hit in quick succession by an eighty-eight-millimeter gun that was enfilading the beach . He watched his third tank go out , expecting the German gun to raise its sights to him  --  the bulky landing craft was an easy target . The last of his tanks went into the water , and the moment it was clear the ramp was raised and the engines put astern . Seven of the eight landing craft backed out from the beach , two burning ; one was left there wrecked . Many more guns on the bluffs had begun to shoot , but they had shifted their targets . Rockwell saw the first of his tanks start to pick its way between the obstacles on the beach . Before it had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw the new targets which had drawn the German lire  --  the infantry landing craft , plowing toward the breakers , running through the spray of shellbursts . The first of these landing craft should have been carrying infantry , with the Navy-Army Demolition Force close behind them ; but on some parts of the beach the demolition men were in the lead . This letter was written by one of them , a seaman : , We stood looking over the side at the beach we were to go in at soon . We were all happy and smiling , telling jokes and yelling . Six o'clock came and we went in . ? There had n't been a shot fired from the enemy yet . Bul soon as we dropped our ramp , an 88-mm. came tearing in , killing almost half our men right there , the officer being the first one ... , From then on things got hazy to me . I remember the Chief starting to take over , but then another one hit , and that did it . I thought my body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big hole in the bulkhead between the sergeant and me . He was dead , it must have been instant , I was blood from head to foot , but did n't know it at the time . Later I found the shrapnel had got me in the left leg and arm . I looked round and saw no one else alive . The explosive was on fire and was burning fast , so I went overboard and headed for the beach . The surf was filled with soldiers trying to get ashore , But the bullets in the surf from the enemy were thick . They were getting killed fast . I reached the obstacks and got behind one to shelter . Just then the landing craft blew up . That got me . Not caring whether I lived or not , i started to run through the fire up the beach . Which was plenty far to run , it probably seemed longer at that Lime . That 's when I found my leg and arm stiff . After a white the soldiers were pouring in thick . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A great many of the 1450 men of the eight companies of infantry suffered this kind of experience . One company , landing a little to the right of Rockwell 's tanks , had one of its six craft sunk half a mile from shore ; men were seen jumping overboard and being dragged under by their heavy equipment . A second craft was blown to pieces by mortar fire , The four others grounded , and the men scrambled out , but the beach had deep runnels there , and some men were out of their depth . Intense machine-gun and mortar fire enveloped them , Many were wounded in the water and fell down and were drowned . A few formed a firing line on the water 's edge ; but soon all the officers and most of the sergeants were killed or wounded , and the leaderless men gave up any hope of advancing across the beach . Within fifteen minutes the company was out of action . This company had landed in the right place . All the rest of the eight companies were carried eastward by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Utah . Two half-mile stretches of the beach had no infantry at all ; other parts had too many . Men found themselves pitched onto the shore in single boatloads , cut off from their officers , faced with defenses which were not the ones they had studied in their briefing , under a terrible gunfire which they had not expected . Not even the heaviest gunfire puts such a strain on a soldier 's morale as not being told what to do . In this respect the demolition men were better off than the infantry . They had a specific job to do , wherever they landed . There were the obstacles in front of them , and each team had to clear a fifty-yard gap right through to the high-water mark , and they had to do it quickly , because the tide was rising . The demolition force was divided into teams of Navy and Army men , each led by a naval officer  --  sixteen teams to blow sixteen gaps in the defenses . The commander of this composite force was a Naval Reserve officer named Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduated I rom the Navin Academy at Annapolis in the ' 20 's . Gibbons himself landed in the middle of the beach . The first two of his men he met said all the rest of their team had been killed . He told them to take cover behind the stone bank till he found a job for them . Next he found a team which had started to fasten its charges to the obstacles . Each man had a string of two-pound blocks of explosive round his waist . Watching this team , Gibbons saw them moving methodically from one obstacle to another , quickly taping the charges onto the stakes and angle irons . One of them was running out the fuse which was to connect all the charges . Another had laid out the two buoys which were to mark the gap and was going up the beach carrying posts with triangles on them which he had to set up as additional gap markers . None of them were showing any visible sign of fear . Gibbons found other learns at work  --  and other teams decimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap blown  --  and the bodies of the men who had blown it scattered among the wreckage of the obstacles . He watched the tide rising . At half tide it rose a foot in eight minutes , and within the first few minutes of the landing it was among the outer obstacles . He gained a rough impression of his men working against time under conditions which he vaguely knew were terrible . It was not till later in the day , when the tide put an end to their efforts , that hc began to learn the extent of their successes . Five gaps had been blown and two partially blown out of the sixteen which had been planned . At least two teams had been slaughtered in landing . One team had laid all its charges and the men were preparing to fire them when a shell hit the fuse and set off all the charges and wounded or killed them all except the man with the markers . Other teams were delayed by infantrymen , desperate for cover , who huddled in groups behind the obstacles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready , at the cost of the lives of two of his men , ran around frenziedly kicking the soldiers to try to make them move so that he could fire the charges . Of Gibbons ' 272 engineers , I i I were killed or wounded , almost all in the first halt ' hour . Yet their gallantry was largely wasted by hastiness in planning , The buoys which they had laid on each side of each gap were metal cans that could be punctured and sunk by a single bullet ; when one was sunk nobody could tell which side of the gap was marked by the one which remained . All that morning landing-craft skippers milled around offshore looking for buoys and posts . Most of them hesitated to trust to luck and charge the obstacles . Two other disasters helped to deprive the stricken infantry of support . First , a large proportion of the artillery intended to land in the first few hours had been loaded in amphibious trucks called DUKWS. t his plan had not made enough allowance har the rough sea , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , il Was a long time before Army engineers succeeded in making any gaps in the hank of stones , which was too steep for tanks to cross , and so the tanks were not able to lead the infantry beyond the beach . Sixteen bulldozers had been provided , but only three survived . One of those was unable to maneuver because of the infantrymen who clung to its shelter . No gaps were made in the bank until lea o'clock . By then it was nearly high tide . The tanks which were still undamaged had been penned into a strip of beach only a few yards wide . Jeeps , trucks and half-tracks had started to land , and DS the tide rolled up to the stone bank , all were caught in a dense jam of vehicles . men and wreckage . This concentration of material was under lire from German guns at close range , and an order had to be sent by radio to suspend all landings of vehicles till something could be done to clear the beach . Into this scene of confusion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted on half-tracks . One section was commanded by a sergeant named Hyman Haas , and his experience was typical of that stage of the battle . Hyman Haas came from the Bronx ; his peacetime job was making frames for ladies ' handbags , and he was notably cheerful and efficient . This was his first combat , and all through it and for months afterward he remained so cheerful and turned out to be so lucky that his section might well have looked on him as a mascot . Sergeant Haas ' men were principally trained as antiaircraft , but they had also practiced on surface targets  --  and that was lucky . The sight of a thirty-seven-millimeter gun coming ashore must have appeared as a godsend to the infantry , some of whom had been there for two hours with no artillery at all . An officer ran toward Haus , shouting and pointing out a pillbox firing from the side of the bluff about 300 yards away . Haas ' gun was mounted so that it could not lire forward on low elevation . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his driver to turn right and then to the right again and drive back into the sea . That brought Ihe half-track stern on to the bluffs ; and there , half-submerged in the surf . Haas trained his gun on the pillbox , He fired ten rounds . So far as he could see , they all went through the aperture and exploded inside . The Ger-man gun was silent after that . For a long time nobody showed Haas another target . There was nothing for him to do but wait , and hope that somebody would punch a hole in the stone bank and let him move inland before his gun was destroyed . It seemed for several hours that the attack was going to fail . The German divisional commander was so confident of the outcome that he sent a part of his reserves to counterattack the British farther east . Gen. Omar Bradley , on the cruiser Augusta , had alarming reports by radio all morning . One staff officer reported landing craft milling around " like a stampeded herd of cattle . " At noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of diverting his follow-up forces to Utah and to the British beaches . Such a decision would presumably have meant writing off the landing at Omaha as a failure and abandoning most of the forces already ashore to be killed or captured . For the next hour and a half this terrible prospect remained in the general 's mind . And then , at 1:30 , seven hours after the landing , he received the message , " Troops formerly pinned down . . . advancing up heights behind beaches . " Something had tipped the balance at last toward victory , It was partly the slow effect of the almost irresistible weight of American arms . The American forces could lose all the tanks and artillery in the lirst waves of their attack ; there were still enormous quantities of tanks and artillery to follow in later waves . They could even lose their first waves of infantry ; tens of thousands more men were waiting and ready to go in . But the German defenses , strong though they were , were limited and immobile , Now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nothing could replace it . Time was bound to wear down the static defenses . This process was quickened by the navy 's intervention , When it became obvious that the soldiers were penned on the beach , destroyers were ordered in as close as they could go , to shell whatever targets they could see . Some of them went in till they scraped their keels on the sandy bottom . So , by naval fire aided by the remnants of artillery on the beach , German guns were silenced one by one . But the men on the beach were not aware of any slackening in the German fire . It is nearly as bad to be shot at by ten guns as by twenty . What really turned the balance was a final stubborn reserve of human courage . On one bit of the beach a lieutenant and a wounded sergeant suddenly stood up among the men who were lurking behind the bank of stones and walked over the top of it . They looked at the wire entanglement just beyond the bank , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men and said , " Are you going to lay there and get killed , or get up and do something about it ? " Nobody moved , so he and the sergeant found explosives and blew a hole in the wire ; and then the men began to stir . An infantry colonel on another part of the beach expressed the same thought , " Two kinds of people are staying on this beach , the dead and those who are going to die . Now let 's get the hell out of here . " In the most effective advance which was made from the beach that morning , a private was the first to go over the bank and set a Bangalore torpedo in the wire . Before he could fire it , he was killed . A lieutenant went over next and fired it and blew a gap . The first man to try the gap was shot ; but others made it , in twos and threes , and found shelter in some empty German trenches , and little by little the numbers increased till the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , several small groups of men began to creep inland across the deadly mine fields . Most of them advanced in single file , each man treading in the footsteps of the man in front , stepping over the bodies of men whom the mines had killed . By noon a few infantrymen were up the bluffs and beginning to attack the beach defenses from behind . No tanks or artillery could follow them , because the valleys were still strongly held . Gibbons was waiting impatiently for the tide to go down again so that he could renew his attack on the beach obstacles . And it was long after nightfall before anyone had any use for the telephone wire which Henry Meyers had carried ashore . Through all these hours , a strong counterattack could have pushed the American forces off Omaha Beach and back into the sea . But no counterattack was made , and for this reprieve thanks were due to the air forces which had won complete supremacy in Western Europe . Allied aircraft that day were delaying the movement of German reserves far and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough , but it was thin .
