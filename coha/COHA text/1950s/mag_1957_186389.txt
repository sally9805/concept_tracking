In garish Acapulco the lavishly jeweled American widow and her elderly lawyer friend were steered everywhere by a handsome Mexican-American travel agent . Young Luis Fenton was a great find . His office was right in their hotel , Las Hamacas . Wealthy Mrs. Edith Hallock , 63 , even wrote home admiringly about him to her sister in New York . With the help of Luis , 33 , she and Joseph A. Michel , 70 , saw everything-from the thrilling high dives of bronzed young natives off the towering sea cliffs to the intriguing low dives along the waterfront . Luis arranged a midnight yacht trip for the happy couple , even brought along the pretty hotel cashier to liven up the party . Wearing silly sailor hats , the laughing foursome cruised over to visit a nightclub on nearby La Roqueta Island . <P> Next night Fenton arranged another boat trip to " a very unusual nightclub " that he was sure his friends would enjoy . This time he brought along Daniel Rios , a waiter at their hotel . On the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boat , the waiter and the travel agent stepped back to chat . Just as the tourists looked up , they were attacked and beaten to death with a baseball bat and a length of chain . The guests were stripped of money and about $18,000 in jewels , their bodies wrapped in chains . Then the hosts dumped them overboard and sailed home . <P> Under a Palm . Until messages for Attorney Michel went unanswered for several days , nobody at the hotel missed the tourists , but finally the police were called . Searching the rooms , the police found all in perfect order : baggage seemingly untouched , an unfinished letter on Mrs. Hallock 's desk . In short order the case bounced onto front pages around the U.S. Alarmed at the potential damage to its booming tourism , Acapulco called in the Federal Security Police . As day after day passed with no word , Mrs. Hallock 's distraught sister , Mrs. Edith Hoffman , arrived from New York . She promptly revealed that the missing couple 's good friend in Acapulco had been Luis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanwhile buried the jewels beneath a palm tree on a lonely beach . Questioned , he claimed steadfastly that he had hardly known the vacationers , said that as far as he remembered Mrs. Hallock had never displayed any jewelry more flamboyant than a trivial topaz ring . As Mrs. Hoffman tore Fenton 's story to shreds , police grilled Waiter Rios , whose share of the loot had been only $200 in cash . Rios admitted that Fenton had hired him to help rob the couple . On the 17th day Fenton lost his nerve ; news had arrived that two bodies had been washed ashore 100 miles north of Acapulco . <P> A Glass of Tequila . Fenton announced that he had indeed planned to rob the Americans , but that the job had been carried out by two local tourist guides . Quickly arrested , they protested innocence . Then came word that the bodies on the beach were those of two unidentified auto-accident victims . In jail Fenton was interviewed by a U.S. newsman , who gave him a glass of tequila to calm his nerves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , police grilled the remorseful travel agent far into the night-until at last he broke down , confessed in full . At week 's end , Luis Fenton 's trusting American friends were still missing , but divers hope to bring them home from his guided tour soon .
