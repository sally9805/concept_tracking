txt In its deeper significance , the outcome of Congress ' economy drive can now be foreseen . For the short run , after all the economy oratory has died away , Uncle Sam will spend close to $70 billion for the fiscal year that starts July 1 . Longer range , the struggle will be to hold spending down to even that lofty level . In short , the central fact that emerges from two and a half months of economy debate is that $70 billion budgets are here to slay . That kind of spending has come to be accepted as normal-1n Washington , anyway . President Eisenhower has said as much , though he does n't put it Lhat way , and , however reluctantly , Congress agrees. , This is not necessarily saying the current economy drive will not succeed , if one limits the definition of success . The lawmakers do seem likely to slow the Government 's spending spree : they may even reduce it for while . ' They can not stop it  --  or rather the lawmakers still lack the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inescapable from what Congress is doing . They 're confirmed in private talks with leading economy advocates . The considered judgment of some of these veteran legislators , who themselves are supporting much bigger budget cuts , is that the House and Senate will end up shaving something like $2.5 billion from Mr. Eisenhower 's $71.8 billion budget . As economy drives go , this might be considered successful . But it would still leave spending for next fiscal year at nearly $70 billion . There are a number of reasons for believing the day of the S60 billion budgets Mr. Eisenhower once promised are over . And one of the big reasons could be cryptically summed up in the phrase , " Economy , But . " Rep. H. A. Dixon of Utah , though doubtless unwittingly , recently expressed his own and many another lawmaker 's dilei*ma in a vivid letter to this reporter . " I believe , " Mr. Dixon wrote , " the principal issues in Utah are western development , economy in Federal spending , a program to meet the drought and help for small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds himself in the same contradictory ' position . The Senate orates about cutting the budget , but votes a $1.5 billion pork barrel of public works projects . The House agitates for less spending , but when faced with a roll call reverses a previous decision to lop $50 million from the Eisenhower budget to help municipalities build sewage disposal facilities . Rep. Thomas A. Jenkins i R. , 0. ) signed a petition demanding a $65 billion budget ceiling , but tells the House Appropriations Committee of his " keen disappOinment " in Mr. Eisenhower 's request for only $3 million for rural libraries . And So It Goes Reps . Bolton 0 . ) , Hyde ( R Md. ) and Baldwin ( R .. Calif. ) demand budget cuts , but protest to the House Appropriations Committee against the Veterans Administration 's decision against building new veterans ' hospi ? tals . in their districts . And so it goes . The economy advocate who does n't sooner or later contradict his economy protestations where his own district is affected would be hard to find . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only one of the reasons $70 billion budgets have become permanent . President Eisenhowq : , who started out in a compromising mood , is growing more and more rigidin his opposition to Congress ' economy drive . High Administration officials confide that the President 's position has now jelled : it boils down to this : " There will be no mote apologies for the budget , " as one aide put it . What Mr. Eisenhower has done , under that policy line , is to free his subordinates to fight budget cutting proposals on Capitol Hill . The most dramatic exercise of that freedom , so far , ' has been Postmaster General Summerfield 's threat to sharply curtail mail service unless Congress gives him the exact amount of money he says he needs . Before the budget battle is over , there 'll no doubt be many another episode , even if less dramatic . in many instances , the lawmakers will give in , just as they seem likely to do in their tussle with Mr. Summerfield . The biggest single item in the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if Congress succeeds in cutting it somewhat this year . Interest on the public debt , running at close to $7 billion a year , will vary slightly from year to year with changes in interest rates . But both the Administration , and Congress are more intent on reducing taxes than in shrinking the public debt and , thus , cutting down on interest costs . Foreign aid has become a permanent part of U. S. foreign policy , no matter what administration is in power . So have expensive domestic programs  --  for farmers , laboring men , small businessmen , big businessmen , veterans , and home builders , to name a few examples . Growing Disturbance There 's no doubt that Congress is deeply concerned over . the size of Mr. Eisenhower 's budget ; the lawmakers are disturbed over the threat of still bigger spending . To the extent that one can judge what politicians will do , Congress is going to make substantial cuts in the Administration 's appropriations requests . They 'll hack away at some domestic programs and lop $1 billion or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy talk , it would be easy to suspect that many a legislator will wind up voting for big doinestic programs , then hope to redeem his economy pledges by supporting slashes in global spending . Congressional leaders have already put Mr. Eisenhower on notice that , as one put it . " He might as well face facts . " The mood of Congress and the country demands big cuts in foreign aid , the President 's Capitol Hill lieutenants have told him . The cuts Congress makes are in appropriations , and it does not follow that corresponding spending cuts would result . In other words , while the lawmakers vote the money , the Administration controls the rate of spending . Funds voted in one year may not be spent for five years . Indeed , without any new appropriations during the current session of Congress , the Administration would start next fiscal year on July 1 with a bout $69 billion of spending authority already authorized . Thus , it seems clear that big budgets are permanently entrenched . Even after this year 's economy efforts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $70 billion rate . Next January , Mr. Eisenhower will send another budget of $70 billion or more to Capitol Hill , and Congress may cut that . But there is still no reason to believe the size of Government  --  or its cost  --  is going to shrink much below the $70 billion mark . If anything , it will move upward in the years ahead  --  unless more and more people want less Government spending and make loud noises about it .
