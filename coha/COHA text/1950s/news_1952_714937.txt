txt ALBANY , Sept. ** Education Commissioner Lewis A. IWilson ruled today that the New 1York City Board of Education had the legal right to ask teachers whether they were members of the ICommunist party and to dismiss - those who refuse to answer . In a far-reaching decision which an Education Department spokesman said could apply to any board of education in the state , Dr. Wilson also ruled the 1949 Feinberg Law was no bar to establishment by the City Board of Education of its own independent list of organizations which advocate the overthrow of the Government by force . Board May Prepare List Under the ruling , it was said , any board of education May set up its own subversive list and question teachers or other school employes , as to their membership in , any organization it has listed . Dr. Wilson emphasized that the board " must , of course , follow the statutory requirements in respect to removal proceedings . " The appeal was brought to ' Dr. Wilson by Irving Adler , a New York City school teacher , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Di ' has been a member of the Communist party . Mr. Adler , . and a group of other teachers who also appealed to the Commissioner ; sought to restrain the City Board of Education from further proceedings . Dr. Wilson said . the three main issues involved were whether the Board of Education had the right to ask whether an employe is or has been a member of the Communist party , whether the employe was obliged to answer under pen // alty of dismissal , and what , if any , effect the Feinberg Law has upon the matter . " The first question , I think , has been settled by the court and presents no particular problem , " Dr. Wilson continued . " There seems to be no doubt that the Board of Edu'cation has a legal right to seek information from its employes as to whether or not they belong to an organization which may be subversive . " The United States Supreme Court has upheld the constitutionality of an ordinance of the city of Los Angeles requiring its employes to state by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Communist party or of the Communist political association . " The answer to the second question flows from the answer to the first . If the board has the legal authority to ask its employes whether they ' are members of an organization held to be subversive , it must follow that the board is enitled to an answer . " Unless there appears a good and sufficient reason for refusal to answer , and no such reason occurs to me presently , the board has the legal right to dismiss . The board must , of course , follow the statutory requirements in respect to removal proceedings before so doing . " The Adler case was the only one decided today . Rulings in the other teacher appeals are expected soon and presumably will follow the principles laid down in today 's dec4 on . Originally Dr. Wilson was awaiting a decision by the Appellate Division in a case brought by eight other city teachers who were removed after refusing to answer questions concerning Communist Iparty affiliation . He recently decided to announce his ruling , al1 though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , 1950 , Dr. Wilson , then Acting Commissioner , upheld the suspension of a group of New York City teachers for refusal to say whether they were or had been Communists . The present case , however , involves the Feinberg Law , the constitutionality of which was upheld by the United States Supreme Court last March . The teachers involved in the current proceedings contended that the city action was an unlawful usurpation of powers vested by the Feinberg Law in the State Board of Regents . The 1949 law directed that the Board of Regents draft a list of organizations it considered subversive and made ' membership in such organizations prima facie evidence for dismissal from any public school post in the state . Former Judge Bruce Bromley of the Court of Appeals has , been named by the Regents to help draw up the list of organizations but it is not expected to be promulgated until later this year . Attack by Teachers Union The State Education Commissioner 's ruling that the Board of Education has the legal right to dismiss emploares who refuse to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Teachers Union of the United Public Workers as " a triumph for the enemies of public education . " In a statement last night , the union said that the decision would subject teachers to " wholesale victimization at the instance of anonymous crackpots , fanatics , professional patrioteers and vigilante pressure groups opposed to free public education . " The decision was characterized by the union as " morally , . legally and ethically wrong and indefensible . " The union said it did not believe that " self-respecting teachers with integrity and loyalty to the ideals of their profession " would submit to it . Any attempt by school officials to use the decision , the union added , " would so completely wreck the schools " that " no responsible " superintendent or board of education would undertake to apply it . The union said use of the decision would " show the board 's callous indifference " to the needs of the Children if a board were to try to " railroad from the school system some of the finest , most devoted and beloved teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroading was in reference to next week 's departmental trials of several teachers , all members of the local , who have refused to answer questions concerning alleged membership in the Communist party .
