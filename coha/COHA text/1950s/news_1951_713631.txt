txt Joe R. Hanley has given Senate investigators an affidavit stating that , in agreeing to run as Republican canIlidate for the Senate in New York last fall , he received no money , property or anything else of value as a consideration . He has offered also to turn over all his financial records for 19501 to the Senate subcommittee on privileges and elections . The subcommittee has been in vestigating the circumstances under which Mr. Hanley , for months ' an open candidate for Governor , stepped down to take the Senatorial nomination . His action permitted Governor Dewey to stand for a third term without opposition from within his own party . Representatives of the subcommittee interviewed Mr. Hanley for a second time on Feb. 6 at Perry , N. Y. It was during this ' - iterview that he gave the affidavit and , through his son , volunteered to make his financial reports for last year available to the subcommittee . r Shortly after deciding to seek a Senate seat , Mr. Hanley wrote a letter to Representative W. Kingsland Macy , a Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disappointed and heartsick " but could do nothing else . Elsewhere in the letter that prompted the Senate investigation after it became public , Mr. Hanley wrote : " If I will consent to take the nomination to the United States Senate , I am definitely assured of being able to clean up my financial obligations within ninety days , so that I would be clear for the first time in twenty years of my life . " I am assured of an adequate living compensation of elected , in a // perfectly legal and unquestionable way . Also I have an ironclad , unbreakable arrangement whereby I will be given a job with the state which I would like and enjoy ( I have been told what it is ) at ? sufficient compensation to make my net income more than I now have . " Subsequently defeated , Mr. Hanley received a $16,000 a year post as special counsel to the State Division of Veterans Affairs from Governor Dewey . Terms of . the appointment enable him to maintain a private law practice at the same time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elections subcommittee , said last week that , while Mr. Hanley 's debts made " interesting reading , " his group 's central purpose was to determine whether there was a " deal " in New York involving the Governor and Mr. Hanley . Note Factor in Inquiry He said that subcommittee investigators in the second interview had " pretty well developed " what Mr. Hanley had to tell but promised there would be broadened lines of inquiry . Agents of the subcommittee apparently did not press Mr. Hanley hard about a purported note for $150,000 made out by Mr. and Mrs. Hanley to C. C. Hagerman of Muscatine , Iowa . They had located Mr. Hagerman earlier and , while admitting a life-long friendship with Mr. Hanley , Mr. Hagerman said he knew nothing of the note , a series of payments listed on its back or a notation of final payment on Sept. 12 , 1949 .. Nor could investigators discover anything of a bank failure in Iowa , earlier attributed by Mr. Hanley as the cause of his indebtedness . In the latest interview , Mr. Hanley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the indebtedness had been assumed by his father from someone whose name he did not intend to reveall because of the injury it might do. I Though supposedly paid off in 1949 , the note became a factor in the investigation in good part because of the language of the Hanley letter to Mr. Macy . In the letter , he wrote that Mr. Macy and Frank Gannett , the Rochester publisher , had been " wonderful . " He added that the " only bright spot in the whole terrible picture is that I shall be able , within a reasonable time , to pay you both in full . " The investigation revealed that Mr. Hanley had borrowed $28,500 in August , 1949 , from Mr. Gannett and the Bank of Manhattan , supposedly to clear his debts . Julian Hanley told investigators on Feb. that $10,000 of this amount coming from the bank had been received by Edgar Hazleton , a Long Island lawyer acting for his father . The funds were deposited to his father 's account at the Citizens Bank of Perry .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
