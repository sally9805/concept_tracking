The insurgents were declared " traitors . " The convention directed locals and the international executive board to try the leaders and oust them for having violated the union constitution . Only two of the 3,500 delegates voted against the purge . The chief dissident was Donald C. Rarick , head of a 4,000-member local at a United States Steel plant in , Pa . He called the convention " the biggest kangaroo court in the world . " Accuses Delegates He said the trials would be a " mockery of justice . " He accused the delegates of having done more to hurt labor by their action than any " rightto-work " law or other restrictive legislation . David J. , the union 's president , said the anti-administration group would receive the full protection of " due process . " All requirements of the Ethical Practices Code of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he added . He told the convention he favored a proposal to remove the rebels without trial , but he refused to allow a vote on such action , he said , because it would permit his foes to apply at once for a court order barring their expulsion Despite the . assurances of a fair trial , Mr. Rarick and his two principal associates were advised to quit the union immediately . The advice was given by Joseph P. Molony of Buffalo , executive board member and secretary of the resolutions committee . He said there was " no place " for them in the union . Mr. endorsed his view . Wo n't Run Away However , the three declared they would not " run away . " They asserted that the rank and file of the 1,250,000-member union would back them in their fight to stay in . They hinted that they might appeal to the courts for help after the ouster proceedings had started .

The contest for the $50 , - 000-a-year presidency was the first in the union 's history . The ouster resolution was presented just after a mock coffin bearing the initials of Mr. Rarick 's Dues Protest Committed had been carried through the hall . It was followed by 100 pro-qzmcq#Donald stalwarts carrying placards with such slogans as " Weed Out the Traitors , " " Dual Unionism Must Go " and " Expel the Phonies Now . " An organ played a dirge during the march . A few minutes earlier Senator John F. Kennedy , Democrat of Massachusetts , had praised the convention as a model of union democracy . He told the delegates he wished some of his fellow Senators could have accompanied him here to see a union that bore no resemblance to the " parasites " under investigation by the Senate rackets committee . Mr. Kennedy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funeral march began . He left the building without being aware that the expulsion move was under way . James P. Mitchell , ?

The attacks on the Renick group began with Mr. 's keynote speech Monday . He urged cheering delegates to " rip this cancer out of your bowels . " In a series of test votes the convention made clear its overwhelming support for the president and its readiness to expel his foes . Boos and catcalls greeted each appearance of , the three top insurgents  --  Mr. Rarick , Nicholas Mamula , head of a 12,000-member local at the Jones &; Laughlin plant at Ali quippa , Pa. , and Frank W. O'Brien , head of a 6,500-man unit at the Hazelwood plant of the same company in Pittsburgh .

Mr. Rarick assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5 would end agitation by his group on the question . This caused no slow-up in the expulsion drive . The resolution charged that the anti-administration faction had " initiated activities designed to destroy both our union and its properly elected officers . " Among the complaints were the bringing of court suits against the union before the rebels had exhausted their internal remedies ; acts of " wilful ' and deliberate slander " against union Officers and members , and the holding of secret meetings at which plots against , the union were made . The resolution held that all members had the right to express their views , but that the minority had an obligation to support the policies adopted by the majority until those policies had been changed through democratic means . When Mr. Rarick rose to respond , the boos made it difficult for him to be heard . The 39-year-old furnace charger told the jeerers it was " easy to stand ' here and laugh when you are in the majority . " He said he knew the membershin still supported him , ' and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He again denied that his group had received outside financial support . Sympathy Voiced The three insurgent leaders did not vote on the expulsion resolution . As they left , a delegate who had not supported them came up to Mr. Renick and said : " I think it 's a sad country when anybody ca n't speak his mind . This is going to cause trouble back home . " He identified himself as Harry Wright , head of Local 1416 in Neville Island , Pa . A few other delegates expressed sympathy . In an impromptu news conference , Mr. Rarick charged that Mr. had won the support of the executive board at the convention by promising he would step down as president at the end of his present term in 1961 . Mr : dismissed the charge as an " absolute lie . " Under the constitution , any member can file charges against the leaders of the Rarick group within the next sixty days .

The board 's decision may be appealed to the union 's next convention in 1960 . Mr. Rarick said " any stooge " could carry an appeal to the executive board if the locals backed the dues-protesters . He ridiculed the charge that his faction represented a dual union , Expulsion would not deprive the rebels of the right to continue working under union-shop agreements in the steel industry . The Taft-Hartley Act prohibits the discharge of workers who ' lose union membership for any reason except refusal to pay dues .
