IT WOULD BE a real help if clerical censors would withhold their proscription of a movie until a reviewer had committed his views to print . I have a notion that Baby Doll is a rather dirty picture , but I hesitate to say so in the wake of Cardinal Spellman 's dogmatic statement that it is every citizen 's patriotic and moral duty to shun the film . My objection , however , is that nothing really happens in Baby Doll ; its dirtiness consists in the fact that it only teases with sex  --  and I think that this is not what outrages the eminent churchman . In 27 Wagons Full of Cotton , the one-act play from which the picture is largely drawn ( it is not an original script , as Warner Brothers chooses to pretend ) , Tennessee Williams was telling ? a smoking-car story , or if you prefer a more respectable precedent , a droll tale in the manner of Balzac . Sex for Balzac was a strong and merry theme , however bizarre the circumstances by which it was accomplished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sound libido onto derive much pleasure from indulging it . But this difference aside , there is more than a passing resemblance between 27 Wagons Full of Cotton and , say , " The Venial Sin " or " The Maid of Thilouse . " A middle-aged man has married a child wife who will not let him touch her . This and business reverses so exasperate him that one night he burns down the syndicate cotton gin that has robbed him of all his customers . The syndicate manager , easily guessing the identity of the arsonist , plans an apt revenge ( he is a Sicilian among Southern wool-hats ) . Early the next morning he brings all his unginned cotton  --  twenty-seven wagons full  --  to his enemy 's plant , and asks the child wife for a glass of lemonade . The husband is soon busy with this bonanza and the manager is soon busy with his wife . When the day 's work is done , the manager announces that from now on all his cotton is coming here for ginning  --  and he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that or someone is going to face a jury . There are unpleasant details  --  the wife appears to be mentally deficient and the manager uses a riding crop to rouse her . But at least the story follows out the Balzac formula that business men should attend to business and leave young girls to their natural companions . Also it was played on Broadway ( as part of a production two years ago called All In One ) with a cartoon briskness and a rough candor that gave it a sardonic wit . For the picture , Williams has complicated and " humanized " the tale . He has brought in eye witnesses to add to the cruelty of the husband 's frustration ; he has turned the wife 's chastity into a calculated weapon ; he has added a deranged old aunt for pathetic effect , and he has turned the manager into a male flirt . No one gets satisfied ; but all the preliminary contacts and , physiological reactions are made as explicit as possible in a public entertainment . Baby Doll betrays again Williams ' infantile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he can not , work it out to a satisfactory consummation . Theme aside , Baby Doll is an extremely well-made picture . Elia Kazan has directed it with tight-focussed intensity ; working almost exclusively in and around a ruined mansion on the outskirts of Benoit , Mississippi , he produces an atmosphere of hunger and heat , danger , revulsion and futility which must be precisely what Williams intended . Karl Malden and Eli Wallach pldy the husband and the manager ; they are both persuasive actors , though in this respect Wallach has the harder task . He must change character at the very moment of achieving his revenge  --  and there is no intrinsic reason for him to do so . But he is able to imply a peculiar sense Of humor that makes his unlikely abstention at least plausible . It also turns the last section of the picture into a slapstick comedy , which is not plausible . Carroll Baker , in the title role , is a shocking slut , with a gift for making the most neutral gestures sug-t , o-estive . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the others  --  but she is very much there , which is a sign of a good performance . Mildred DunnOck , as the addled aunt , , is got up as though for a dramatic monologue . She squeaks and she dithers , but is somewhat at a loss to get into the picture . It 's not her fault .
