one or more of the suede-covered volume-lets , violet , rose , or sage-green in color , containing extracts ( or " Gems " ) from Mrs. Wilcox 's body of poetry . True , at this very moment there can be few adults unfamiliar with the poet 's name and it may be , though unwittingly , with some of her verses . " Laugh and the world laughs with you . . . . " ? " It is easy enough to be pleasant , When life flows by like a song . . . . " Do not these lines , even in the most cultivated mind , ring some distant , thin , metallic bell ? All the same , the Times of 1919 has made a bold statement , and one which tempts a curious reader to journey a little further into the lady 's life and works . So to the pursuit of Mrs. Wilcox . An intensive reading of all the Wilcoxiana I could lay my hands on ? her complete poems , an autobiography , some fragmentary material , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left me not only exhilarated but ? what shall I say ? ? respectful . pHOTOGRAPHS of the poet at all ages were quite abundant ; they present a face so little unexpected as to seem straightway familiar . it is a handsome face , changing little with the years ? a face at once feminine and formidable , with plenty of fair curling hair , attractive blunt features , and a determined lower jaw . The eyes are intensely purposeful . Though full-length photographs show that she was very short ( she would have liked to be tall , with a " long swan-like neck " ) it is clear that she was never insignificant . " Her hair was light , " one writer noted ; " her eyes had tigerish gleams when she wore her favorite topaz . She always had to have some chiffon fluttering in her hand or round her neck . " The episode of her meeting with James Whitcomb Riley in the days of her early success as a magazine contributor adds a little to this picture . The two poets had been corresponding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt , have long continued to do so had not Mr. Riley arranged one day to call . " I attired myself , " she relates , " in a new gown ? one of the first really modish gowns I had ever owned . I remember it was black , with little pipings of pale blue , simple , but quite in the fashion . My hair also was arranged in the fashion of the hour . The front was cut in a full fluffy ' bang ' whicheverybody feminine wore just then . I had at that time a radiant bloom ; and I went to meet my caller , thinking my black and cerulean gown was very becoming . Not so Mr. Riley . " Mr. Riley , in fact , had exact views on how " a genius " should dress and behave , and these views did not include the pastimes ( to which Miss Wheeler admitted ) of dancing and lawn tennis . And how , he asked her , did she think " that God-woman Mrs. Browning " would have looked in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better , " Mrs. Wilcox tells us that she replied , " than she did with the corkscrew curls prominent in the pictures I had seen of her . " Their friendship never recovered from the meeting . Still , she commented , " He and I were not suited to be chums . " This bright young woman came of an impoverished family who had moved from Vermont to Wisconsin a year before her birth ? she was the last of four children ? in a melancholy attempt to earn a living by farming . Such a life destroys the weak , though the tough may profit from it . It gave Ella a stimulus to exotic dreaming , but also a habit of desperate industry even more useful , maybe , than her prenatal experience of Shakespeare , Scott , and " various works of action , " to which her mother , frustrated in her own life , had applied herself , in the hope and belief that the child would turn out to be a novelist . In late years this daughter was able to write : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has held more gold than gray , And that the splendor of the real Surpassed my early dreams ' ideal . For , apart from dreams and toil , the dismal farm life had little to offer the romantic and energetic Ella . By the time she was twenty she was almost supporting the Wheeler family with her busy verse and prose contributions to Western magazines . Her success , though large and demonstrative in the native manner , was of a local kind until 1883 , the year of Poems of Passion . p GEMS of PASSION ! How thrilling is the sound ? and yet , how innocent the story of this little volume . The fifty or so poems it contains had all appeared separately in periodicals before the author offered the THE DOMESTIC BARD : collection to a publisher . " My amazement , " she records , " can hardly be imagined when Jansen and McClung returned the manuscript of my volume , intimating that it was immoral . " A newspaper heard of the matter and came out with the strange headlines : TOO LOUD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BADGER GIRL WHOSE VERSES OUT-SWINBURNE SWINBURNE AND OUT-WHITMAN WHITMAN Other papers echoed the tale ; other publishers made offers for the book , which was an immediate and lasting success when it appeared , on both sides of the Atlantic . Churlish readers insisted that the poems were based on the author 's own " immoral experiences . " It was far from being the case . My knowledge of life she writes was bounded by visits to Madison and Milwaukee , Chicago , and some lesser villages ; and by books I had read and letters I had received from more or less intellectual people . The works of Gautier , Daudet , Oujda , with a hit of Shakespeare , Swinburne , and Byron . . no doubt lent to my vivid imagination and temperamental nature the flame which produced the censured verses . No critic could have put it better ? though the list might have included Rossetti . The American press , all the same , showed displeasure . The Chicago Herald , quoting a description of them as " the songs of half-tipsy wantons , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relapse into Poems of Decency . " Charles A. Dana , in a scathing review for the New York Sun , quoted half a column of lines containing the word kiss . " This brought me , " she notes , " scores of letters asking where the book could be purchased ; and I wrote a note of thanks to Mr. Dana . " Mr. Dana , she adds , " was exceedingly wroth at my note . " It is hard today to understand the disturb . ance caused by these simple though spirited verses . One or two drawing-room pieces have , it is true , an extra dash of operatic Bohemia ; " The Duet , " for instance , in which a gentleman indulges , while his wife Maud is singing , in memories of Lisette , a " grisette , " with whom he was once ( as Mrs. Wilcox would have put it ) chums . And between the verses for interlude , I kissed your throat , and your shoulders nude . . They have ceased singing that old duet , Stately Maud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat with your cigarette , And qu'avez-vous , dearest , your lids are wet , " Maud says , as she leans o'er me . And I smile , and lie to her , husband-wise , " Oh , it is nothing but smoke in my eyes . " But mostly they confine their flan , which is considerable , to a less precise treatment of such motifs in human relationships as con-stancy , inconstancy , hope , pleasure , nostalgia . Still , however guilelessly meant , her poems have an impulsiveness that often invited trou-ble . One of these was " The Birth of the Opal , " written at the request of a jeweler who thought of this stone ( he said as the child of the sunbeam and the moonbeam . A pretty notion . Yet one literary hostess ceased to in-vite the author to her salon on the grounds that in her somewhat de'gne lines she had " laid bare all the secrets of married life . " " My God , madam , " exclaimed a Spaniard to whom Mrs. Wilcox confided this , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The poem , nevertheless , remained a favorite piece for recital in those fabulous New York drawing rooms of the eighties and nineties . We are told that young Aubrey Boucicault , " ' a beautiful lad , a sort of child prodigy in the artistic circles of New York , " made them a specialty . II RS . ' WILCOX 'S marriage , it is pleasant to note , was long and happy . Robert Wilcox , her husband , a large and kindly man , seems to have possessed the pecu-liar reserves of calm , stability , and devotion that his position exacted ; he shared with her , moreover , the interest in psychic phenomena which became more and more part of her life . But poetry and spiritualism alone could not absorb her enthusiastic energy . At her sum-mer home on the Connecticut coast we read of her organizing good works , running " cos-HARPER 'S tume balls , soirees , and musicales . " She loved swimming ( which her poor mother had forbidden as " immodest " ) ; she loved dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheeler Wilcox Glide ? " though " ( to quote a friend ) " there was only one person in all the United States who would perform all those rococo turns and twists on a ballroom floor ; and that was Ella Wheeler Wilcox . " Her enormous vitality never flagged . She traveled . She was over sixty when she went with her husband to North Africa where " each evening " ( she recalls ) " he liked to have me take my mandolin out under the big terebinth tree and play the Arabian airs while he smoked his cigar . " She enjoyed reading ? and rhyming ? about scientific progress . " I look to Science for the cure of Crime , " runs one of her poems . Even more practically , she wrote in the Hearst press answers to everyday problems that are remarkable for their common sense , boldness , and absence of sanctimoniousness . They include a recommendation to parents to give biological instruction to the young . " Do not imagine that innocence necessitates ignorance , " she de-dared . " Deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will assert itself sooner or later . " Her good will embraced not only " democracy , " but transatlantic accord . We may pause at this portrait , the Englishman 's portrait : For under the front that seems so cold , And the voice that is wont to storm , We arc certain to find a big broad mind And a heart that is soft and warm . And he carries his woes in a lordly way As only the great souls can : And it makes us glad when in truth we say , " We are kin of the Englishman . " When Queen Victoria died she was sent over by the New York American to write a poem about the funeral . A sentence : " The Queen is taking a drive today , " in an old magazine in the hotel reading room gave her inspiration . " I had never been especially interested in the Queen , " she records , " but as I wrote I began to feel very deeply her worth , and the pathos of her last ride ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be studied by all occasional-verse writers . The poem , " The Queen 's Last Drive , " was cabled to America , cabled back to an English paper the same day , set to MAGAZINE music by a friend of the new King , and a year later sung at the Royal Family 's memorial service . Without being somber or overawed ? its author never was either ? it is a set piece of which no Laureate need have been ashamed ; though I find in the journals of " Michael Field " that it drew a peevish comment from the two esoteric ladies who wrote under this nal n e . We see her for a moment in Paris , invited ( commanded is perhaps a better word ) to take breakfast with Sarah Bernhardt ; and in London again , in 1913 , being presented at Court . A little difficulty arose here because ? . in spite of the nervous protests of her publishers and of American Embassy officials ? she declared that she would wear a headdress not of feathers but of lilies . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told them . She did . She wore feathers . But her verve , we may be sure , was unabated . V ERVE and versatility ? they are the outstanding features of her writing , as of her life . They prevented her , undoubtedly , from being a better poet than she was . For what is likely to disconcert a sophisticated reader is not merely the range of her poetic output , but how nearly good it contrives at moments to be . ( She herself , it is only fair to say , would not have admitted the variation in quality that such a tribute assumes . ) A poem like " The South " suggests , for all its glib adjectives , something a little more than virtuosity . A queen of indolence and idle grace , Robed in the vestments of a costly gown , She turns the languor of her lovely face Upon progression with a lazy frown . Her throne is built upon a marshy down ; Malarial mosses wreath her like old lace ; With slim crossed feet , unshod and bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race . Across the seas there stalks an ogre grim ; Too languid she even for fear 's alarms , While frightened nations rally in defense , She lifts her smiling Creole eyes to him , And reaching out her shapely unwashed arms She clasps her rightful lover ? Pestilence . In her early poems it is interesting to see her THE DOMESTIC BARD : sampling the manners of her illustrious near-contemporaries : it may be Tennyson : I said to my heart , " Let us take our fill Of mirth , and music , and love , and laughter ; For it all must end with this waltz . quadrille .... " or Swinburne : She walks in her beauty immortal . Each household grows sad as she nears , But she crosses at length every portal , The mystical Lady of Tears . or Rossetti : Her check was wan , her wistful mouth Was lifted like a cup , The rnoonful night dripped liquid light : She seemed to quaff it up . ( Oh ! that unburied corpse that lies in space . ) Here are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrative " Maurine " not in the least unrelated to " Aurora Leigh . " Yet rightly , I think , we prefer to those just quoted , such lines as : We people who chum with the waves and the wind Know more than all wise weather bureaus combined . For she was in her own way an original . The Wilcox manner is unmistakable . Why sit down in goom and darkness With your grief to sup ? As you drink Fate 's bitter tonic Smile across the cup . One can almost hear the voice behind it . It . is the authentic voice of that nineteenth-century literary phenomenon , the domestic bard . III T . domestic bard ? the poet of the universal middle sentiment appearing in homes and hearts but not the serious anthologies ? is , indeed , one of the many byproducts of the Industrial Age . The particular virtues extolled , the consolations offered , are acceptable only to a middle-class community , of few and small ambitions and many and small anxieties . Such an audience appeared for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created are not identical in manner or even in philosophy , but they share certain features . In language made palatable by familiar groups of words ( not enough tribute has been paid to the consoling powers of the cliche ) they offer a compound of hope and acceptance . They are immensely fluent . They believe absolutely in what they write ? and they assure their readers that their reach is equal to their grasp . In their own work , about which they have no doubts at all , they have found that the principle holds true . Without understanding the needs of this audience and the power of the simple sentiment , the popularity of Martin Tupper , the foremost nineteenth-century exponent in England , must always seem a mystery . He was a pioneer , it is true ; he could wring innumerable themes from the favorite matter of family life ; but he was dull , which Mrs. Wilcox never was . Nothing of Martin Tupper survives . More interesting is the comparison between Mrs. Wilcox and her present-day successors . I have been studying some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own time , whose rhymes ? printed on the page to resemble prose ? are read , it would seem , in many , many homes . Homely ? or should it be homey ? ? is a word which well describes them . They recommend a little hope , much submission ( " making the best of it " ) , no resentment , no rebellion . Be thankful , says this poet in her way , for the little things : gardens , daffodils , the kettle on the hearth , " doggies , " gnomes and pixies , " meneries " or gentle wish-fantasies ( " just a little house that 's built of little passing dreams " ) . It is a consoling but not an inspiring message ; beside Mrs. Wilcox 's robust exhortations to stand up to life , it looks distinctly pale . If Ella Wheeler was banal , she was at least banal on the grand scale . Woman to her was not a kitchen vestal but " a saint , a siren , and a paradox . " Gnomes and daffodils were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things ? but people were better ; new ones when those she knew let her down . " Give me strong new friends when the old prove weak , " she wrote . She lived in the moment ; it was one of her many likeable qualities . But I ? I look out on my fair Today ; I clasp it close and kiss its radiant brow . Here with the perfect Present let me stay , For I am happy now . The Quiet Corner out of the world can never have been to her taste . " Be not content ; contentment means inaction , " she declared . And in another poem : " All virtue is worth just the price it cost ; Black sin is oft white truth that missed its way . " It 's easy enough to be prudent When nothing tempts you to stray , When without or within no voice of sin Is luring your soul away ; But it 's only a negative virtue Until it is tried by fire .... No virtue of which she approved could remain negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of abstinence , if the context required , with a positive and even exhilarating quality . We see this in her first published work , those temperance verses which are so remarkably like drinking songs ; * and in one of her latest pieces , a verse exhortation to the soldiers in the 1914 war to " Come Back Clean . " Both , we are told , had something of the same hypnotic success . *Here are some samples from Drops of Water : Do n't drink , boys , do n't ! There is nothing of happiness , pleasure , or cheer In brandy , in whiskey , in rum , ale , or beer ... I will paint you a sign , rumseller , And hang it about your door .. . I will paint you again , rumseller , I will paint you as you stand With a foaming glass of liquor , Holding in either hand . He wavers , but you urge him , " Drink/ pledge me just this one ! " And he lifts the glass and drains it , And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beaming eye , She lightly laughs and lifts the wine-glass high , And says the while her red lips sip and taste , " A fig for temperance ; wine 's too goud to waste ! " N PRACTICE the most virtuous of women -- her own marriage and the admiration of her public provided all the romance she needed ? she made it clear in her writings that nothing came before the claims of " that warm red rebel , the Heart . " She had no use for half-measures , in love or in anything else . About polygamy she remarked ( she had been visiting Utah ) : " I would rather be a deceived wife , or the unfortunate affinity , even , on whom the world looks askance , than accept the position of one of a syndicate owning stock in a husband . " The married coquette ? frequently the subject of her verses ? drew her particular criticism . I quote from one dramatic monologue in which a gentleman explains to the wife of his friend the reason for his abrupt departure : Then why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mine abroad , Whose theories I have been acting upon Has proven himself a fraud . You have heard me quote from Plato A thousand times , no doubt ; Well , I have discovered he did not know What he was talking about . She was not silent in the face of criticism : pity and scorn joined in her vigorous replies to letters or reviews . " It can not harm me , " was a typical reply to an attack , " because my gifts are too well known , my work too well appreciated , and my own reverence and love for my growing poetical powers too great to be affected by such a stab , but it does great harm to you as a critic . " Criticism , she held , should be " big , broad , fearless , kind . " Even in the Poems of Passion days she had been self-possessed enough to reply to a lady objector : " It would have been wrong for you to write Poems of Passion because you would have felt that you did wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Nor would I omit one from the collection now . . . . " But verse was always her best weapon . Let us look , for instance , at her defense of rhyme : And quite out of date , too , is rhythmical metre ; ? The critics declare it an insult to art . But oh ! the sweet swing of it , ohl the clear ring of it , Oh , the great pulse of it , right from the heart , Art or no art . I find these lines quite irresistible . They contain , moreover , the essential Ella Wheeler Wilcox ? her absolute assurance , her gaiety , gusto , and generosity , her relative placing of heart and art . She had enough talent , one suspects , to be able to choose her road ? and a choice always involves a rejection . If we find her at her best when she is at her worst , this is the inevitable fate of a capable writer unhaunted by the sad anxieties of taste , or the pains of self-criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
