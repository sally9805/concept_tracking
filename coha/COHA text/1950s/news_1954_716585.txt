txt There is nothing particularly novel in having a President more popular than nit - political - party. , But our own . reper%terii-eihiihriVe been touring the country  --  these pre-election weeks note a rethel- unusual discrepancy between the prestige of the President ; and his , party . - And they find people giving a very special reason for it . Ia aim , people seem to view Mr. Eisenhower as " above politics . " They tbirik.of him simply as a sincere , decent sed'heneet-Citizen who is trying hard to be-President " of all the people . " This is , and is intended to be , a great compliment to W.-Eisenhower , and it is a , rebuke to those politicians , some of whom have been Presidents , who would subordinate everything else to the advancement of their own political party . . But it seems to us that it is a view which misinterprets the nature of the Presidency and our political institutions . That as a practical matter a President serves a dual role as Chief Executive of the Government and leader of his political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tendency , sometimes shared by Mr. Eisenhower himself , to deplore the dual nature of the office . What is ' not so well understood is that the proper playing of this dual role is one of the necessities of good government . For we will not have effective government when a President fails in either . This country is not governed by a man but by a group of men , in the adMinistrative branch and in the legislature . If it is to be governed well , this group must share in a broad way a common view of the proper policies of government . That is , they must have enough political views in common to give each other at least enough general support to permit the government to act purposefully . Effective government , then , requires that a President be a party leader for two reasons . He must lead his party so that its members will follow a common path on major matters of policy . And he must be a party leader so that when the people come to choose there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes and executes them . The very high popularity of President Eisenhower suggests that by and large the people approve of the course he has set for the Government , both in legislation and administration . Since we have had a Republican Administration and a Republican Congress that ought to mean public support for the Republican party . But evidently it does not . There is too little identity between the President and his party . In this campaign the Democrats have shrewdly capitalized on this . Where they have to concede accomplishments of this Administration they credit the President , who is not running , and themselves for supporting him . Whatever the Administration has done that they think unpopular they , blame on the Republican party which , they imply , is something different from the President . All this , of course , helps to remove from Mr. Eisenhower the onus of the mistakes , failures or those unpopular measures . But it equally removes from his party any of the credit for the very real accomplishments of his Administration . A President of the United States is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . He can ignore that only at the price of lost leadership . We can forget it only at the cost of more difficult government .
