After the Providence Journal-Bulletin discovered eleven Boston sportswriters on the payrolls of New England race tracks ( TIME , April 26 ) , the J-B dug deeper . Last week it uncovered 15 additional newsmen working part time for the tracks . More important , it turned up ten newsmen on the staffs of four Boston dailies who were also on the state payroll and had received $60,000 for " services ranging from issuing publicity releases to working on politically appointed state commissions . " One of the political reporters , said the JB , actually has civil-service status . Most of the Boston dailies shrugged off the J-B 's charge , saw " no conflict of interest . "
