When he was born , in London , even his mother thought that he seemed to have a thick skin . As the baby grew , his skin darkened and hardened to a black , rough casing over his whole body except the chest , neck and face . It was covered with close-set black bumps ; between them the skin was as hard as a fingernail , and if it was bent it cracked and oozed bloodstained serum . Someone cruelly dubbed him " the elephant boy . " Doctors said he had been born with ichthyosis ( fish-scale disease ) . Nobody knew its cause or cure . <P> Treatment at some of London 's best hospitals did no good . A trial operation to graft normal skin from his chest to his horny palms proved worse than useless : the grafted skin blackened like the rest , then shrank and stiffened his fingers . The boy went to school , but his teachers and the other pupils objected to him . Though he was quick to respond to affection , he got so little that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abraham Mason heard of the case . In his studies of psychosomatic conditions , he had taken an interest in hypnosis . Eighteen months ago , in a white-painted hospital room in East Grinstead , Sussex , a dozen skeptical doctors watched as Dr. Mason talked the boy into a hypnotic trance . It took ten minutes . Then Hypnotherapist Mason said again &; again : " Your left arm will clear . " ( He had begun with a particular part of the body to make the test more precise . ) <P> About five days later , the coarse outer layer on the boy 's left arm became soft and crumbly , and fell off . The skin underneath was reddened , but soon became pink and soft . In ten days the arm was clear from shoulder to wrist . <P> Dr. Mason tried again &; again , cutting his hypnosis time to three seconds . After he said the right arm would clear , it did . The boy 's thighs and legs , which had been most heavily covered , cleared partially . His back was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he had ever expected to be , has learned to hypnotize himself to maintain the improvement . He is working as an electrician 's helper . <P> Skin specialists who read of the case last week in the staid British Medical Journal snorted , did not see how hypnosis could ease a condition which began in the womb . Neither could young ( 26 ) Dr. Mason , but he had witnesses to his treatment and the boy 's improvement .
