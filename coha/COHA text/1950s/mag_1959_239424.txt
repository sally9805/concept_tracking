For the first time , Dwight Eisenhower stood on the edge of a congressional defeat . At issue was S. 144 , the relatively trivial Rural Electrification Administration bill , which would transfer power to approve or reject REA loans from Agriculture Secretary Ezra Benson to power-hungry Clyde Ellis , director of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association . To farm-state representatives of both parties the bill was alluring ; Ellis for weeks had been bringing his regional managers into Washington to buttonhole Congressmen . As drafted by Benson-hating Senator Hubert Humphrey , moreover , S. 144 was a direct slap at the bedeviled Agriculture Secretary and , indirectly , at the President himself . <P> <P> Mission Accomplished . The bill breezed through Congress according to schedule : 60-27 in the Senate , 254-131 in the House . Ike promptly vetoed it-exercising his thumbs-down right for the first time in the Democratic 86th Congress . Last February Ike had told a hostile REA meeting in Washington that it was time for prospering REA to give up its subsidy of low-rate Government loans ( TIME , Feb. 23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had all but fulfilled its mission-96% of the nation 's farms have been electrified , more than half of them through REA loans-and noted that there was no sensible reason for changing a successful administrative system . " The REA , " said Ike , " has been working well and progressing efficiently under the existing administrative arrangements . The change in those arrangements proposed by S. 144 would be contrary to the public interest . " <P> Back on Capitol Hill , Speaker Sam Rayburn and Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson saw opportunity : REA was one of those rare issues where Democrats of the South would likely stick together with other Democrats around the compass . They decided they could muster the necessary two-thirds vote to override the veto and doubly defeat the President . Republican Leader Everett Dirksen and Ike 's other lieutenants in the Senate were in glum agreement ; with the help of six farm-bloc minded Republicans ( Kentucky 's John Sherman Cooper . South Dakota 's Francis Case and Karl Mundt , North Dakota 's Milton Young and " Wild Bill " Langer , Nebraska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 29 with two votes to sp : re . But Indiana 's Charles Halleck , the shrewd minority leader in the House , had already taken a reading , saw a fighting chance to defeat the bill and sustain Ike 's perfect veto record . <P> <P> Without waiting for the official veto message to reach the Capitol , Halleck and his whip , Illinois ' Les Arends , had gone to work . All weekend they pestered and pressured their reluctant colleagues in the teeth of immense home-front opposition . Telephones buzzed and wires poured in from rural constituencies , urging passage of the bill . Worried Republicans from farm districts pleaded that a nay vote would be political harakiri , but Halleck sternly told them that it was a case of Ike or REA 's Ellis-take your choice .
