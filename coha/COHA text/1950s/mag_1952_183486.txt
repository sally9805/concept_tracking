Generations of doctors have talked about " shock , " but they have never agreed on what they mean by it . Trying to be more precise , some have distinguished different types such as those caused by fright and cold , and a special kind of " wound shock . " Others have gone on to such refinements as primary and secondary wound shock . All this , say two British physicians , is not good enough : wound shock must be even more carefully classified if the patient is to get the right treatment-and the wrong treatment may cost the patient his life . <P> Drs . Ronald T. Grant and E. Basil Reeve found themselves caught in this confusion early in World War II , when they treated 120 victims of bombings and accidents in England . They went on to Italy and treated 190 more ( both soldiers and civilians ) . They soon dropped the word shock from their vocabulary , because they found it not a help but a hindrance . From the varied conditions formerly lumped as shock , Grant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their symptoms . <P> " Tip Up the Bed . " What goes on in a patient suffering from " shock " ? Dr. Grant admits frankly : " That 's the point-we do n't know . " Trying to find the answer , he is working on rabbits in a cramped laboratory at London 's ancient ( 1721 ) Guy 's Hospital . Sometimes a patient who has merely been jarred by bad news or a fright shows about the same " shock " symptoms as one who has been injured . <P> " Tip up one end of the bed , " says Dr. Grant briskly , " and in five minutes they feel better if there 's no injury . Once , during the war , they brought in an old dame . They thought she was going to die . Her pulse was down around 50 , and blood pressure about the same , and they called it ' severe shock . ' I tipped up her bed lowering her head and turned round to get ready for a transfusion . When I turned back a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I examined her , her injury was nothing-only a crushed toe . " <P> Stories about a fatal kind of " battle shock " with no visible injury have caused further medical confusion . " There was a great haroosh in World War I about men showing all these symptoms but with no injury , " he says , " so we looked for such cases in World War II . We never found one . Perhaps later examination showed that the man had had a brain concussion , or died from carbon monoxide produced by the bomb . So-called ' pure shock ' may exist , but I have n't seen it . To me , so far , it 's a bogy . " <P> Do n't Delay . The first thing to do for victims of " shock " and injury , Drs . Grant and Reeve found ( as did U.S. Army medics , especially in Korea ) , was to see whether the patient had lost blood , and if so , how much . In some cases , even when the blood pressure was normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume of blood lost , say the doctors , should be computed ( by a quick and simple dye method ) . Their motto : " If in doubt , transfuse . " <P> It is , they say , " bad practice to delay transfusion . " And a patient with a very large wound needs " much more than even a bold transfusion officer is inclined to give till he has learned for himself . " The objective is to restore blood volume to at least 70% of normal and keep on going to 80% or more as a margin of safety .
