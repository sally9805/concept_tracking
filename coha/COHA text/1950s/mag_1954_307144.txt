France 's audacious Premier Mends-France lives on drama . By making Christmas the deadline for ratification of the Paris accords , he has loaded the interim period with high suspense . His Assembly opponents countered by filling the script with highly charged dialogue . <P> The first matter before the House was a bill amending the French constitution . This proposal was so far short of the reforms that France needs that it quickly became known as La Rformette . In fact , instead of making it harder for the Assembly to unseat Premiers at will , it provides that a candidate needs only a simple majority of those voting , instead of an absolute majority of 314 , to be invested as Premier ( thus making it easier to find a new man ) , and provides that he must present his entire Cabinet before winning the Assembly 's confidence ( thus increasing the pressure the Assembly can put on him ) . There were also useful provisions designed to handicap the Communists , e.g. , eliminating the chance of Communists getting interim Cabinet posts after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for four years and was not Mends ' baby , but he demanded that the Assembly avoid a national referendum on the issue by giving it a three-fifths vote . The Assembly obliged . <P> <P> A Lie Nailed . A few days later , Deputy Jean Legendre , member of the faction that broke with De Gaulle , implied , without offering proof , that Mends and his top advisers had been responsible for leaking secret government information to the Communists before he became Premier . Legendre recalled that in August last year ex-President Auriol had summoned the Defense Committee , saying : " There is a traitor among us . " Pointing at Mends ' Interior Minister , Francois Mitterrand , Legendre shouted : " Three weeks later you resigned from the Cabinet . " Pale with anger , Mends leapt to his feet , crying : " What are you insinuating ? " <P> In rebuttal , Mitterrand called upon Georges Bidault to testify that Mitterrand had left the Laniel government because of policy differences . Bidault , still bitter from the defeat of EDC , agreed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all other testimonials . " <P> Mends , taking the rostrum , said that as a result of the " remorseless campaign " of lies and calumnies conducted by " certain leading persons in France , " he had suffered ' ' deep humiliation " when negotiating with allied statesmen in London . " I will not submit to this usury , " he said . " The question which faces you tonight is . . . does the government have your confidence as patriots and Deputies ? " The vote : 287 to 240 in favor of Mends , his smallest majority yet .
