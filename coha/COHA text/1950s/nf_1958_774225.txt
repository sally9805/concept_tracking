And who shall say that the spirit does not dwell as much there as in great halls with first-class choirs and orchestras ?

It is a way of life both personally and artistically supremely worth while . Omnis spiritus laudet Dominum . The discussion revolved round the relationship of religion to art ; and it was clear that religious belief affects an artist 's work fundamentally . Mr. Galliver insisted on the autonomy of the art of singing , its validity footnote 1 Shakespeare : Henry VIII , III , i , 6-8.  | as a discipline in itself ; and in this sense musical interpretation has nothing to do with belief .

It was suggested to Mr. Galliver that in spite of its excellences The Dream of Gerontius is in some ways not as Catholic , musically , as Bach . Whilst the subject is Catholic , the music lacks the depth and integrity which in Bach make one think of it as finer music theologically ' . Mr. Galliver agreed . There was some discussion about those artists whose gifts depend directly on their bodily fitness , such as singers and ballet dancers . As these artists are physically more vulnerable than any others , what happens to them when they lose the physical capacity to follow their art ? Is teaching a possible way out for them , and can they direct their creative energy in teaching ? Mr. Galliver pointed out that many singers could go on singing professionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not always arise . However , when it did , it seemed that while some could be happy teaching , many could not . Mary Drage witnessed that this was true , only more tragically so , in the case of a dancer , for her retirement from the stage was often an unmitigated tragedy . Sometimes the creative energy could go happily into teaching , but often not . It was perhaps , at this point , that the inadequacy of the common approach to art today was most plainly laid bare . Treated as an end in itself , as a religion instead of a function of religion , art may leave its devotees eventually prostrate .  | EDWARD WRIGHT Mr. Wright spoke as a painter who sees his painting as part of a whole life and not simply as an isolated art ' . He teaches at the Royal College of Art . THE easel picture according to Panofsky is a man-made object demanding to be experienced aesthetically ' . In other words it is an object which requires intuition and an attitude of mental re-creation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this object is known as a painter , although he may not use paint always nor even use it at all . His picture may consist of readymade coloured substances glued together ; it may include a whole magpie 's nest of relics from other crafts and industries whenever technique is used as a creative process . If it is a painting one expects it to look like paint or like sand , feathers or sacking if they are the real physical ingredients . At times when an unobtrusive film of paint represented the window into which the spectator looked , the technique could be self-effacing and smooth ( Van Eyck , Piero Bella Francesca , David ) . It did not mean that the paint had been used with the intention of misleading the spectator into the belief that this was not paint . But such an attitude is no longer valid for our time . Panofsky also says : Where the sphere of practical objects ends , and that of " art " begins , depends , then , on the " intention " of the creators . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place , " intentions " are . . . incapable of being defined with scientific precision . In the second place , the " intentions " of those who  | produce objects are conditioned by the standards of their period and environment . ' l THE PAINTER So , the physical ingredients of a painting only turn it into an image because the painter intended it to be that thing . And who is the painter ? He is , to begin with , a maker of images and his identity is always modified by exterior and interior forces , by the time and the society to which he belongs , by his faith and doubts , by his material limitations , and finally by the accumulating evidence of the works which he produces . A creative process includes both task ' and play ' , and the play ' element is also revealed in the persona which the painter acquires . Picasso , for example , is technically so brilliant and so articulate in inventing and handling visual symbols that he becomes the archparodist and transformer of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the works of Cranach , El Greco , Poussin , Delacroix , Courbet , and many others . This kind of play can also be recognized in the jazz music of Jelly Roll Morton , Oscar Petersen , and Dave Brubeck among others . Given the time and the necessary scholarship it would be interesting to trace the history of the persona of the painter . Many writers about prehistory agree that the image-maker of the late palaeolithic or ice-age was the priest or magician of his social group . Kuhn , describing a painting in the cavern of the Trois Freres says : Above them all is the picture of the magician himself , the portrait of the man who may , indeed , have executed some of the engravings . With his large , dark eyes he gazes at the visitor . It is impressive , it is even alarming to look steadily into those eyes which for millennia have stared down from a height into vacant space . This shaman wears upon his head the mask of a stag with its antlers . Bear 's paws cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waist . One leg is raised as in a dance.2 footnote 1 Erwin Panofsky : Meaning in the Visual Arts . 2 Herbert Kuhn : Rock Pictures of Europe . See Plate 14.  | Prehistoric men believed in a mystic identity between human being and animal ; this belief was celebrated in a ritual play performed by the magician , disguised in animal form . This also shows that from earliest times painting had been used to depict simultaneous aspects of one being and the idea that a single person can have more than one nature . The painter participated in the ritual when he made his images of it . Kuhn even suggests that both priest and painter may have been the same person . A relationship between ritual and play in primitive society has also been suggested in Homo Ludens by Johan Huizinga : In play as we conceive it the distinction between belief and make-believe breaks down . ' He adds : The concept of play merges quite naturally with that of holiness . Any prelude of Bach , any line of tragedy proves it . By considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we pave the way to a more direct and more general understanding of its peculiarities than any meticulous psychological or sociological analysis would allow . Primitive or , let us say , archaic ritual is thus sacred play , indispensable for the well-being of the community , full of cosmic insight and social development but always play in the sense Plato gave to it ? an action accomplishing itself outside and above the necessities and seriousness of everyday life . In this sphere of sacred play the child and the poet are at home with the savage . ' THE PAINTER 'S TASK Poetry is saturated with the play instinct and at the same time the poet has a task . Now according to Mallarme the task of the poet is to purify the language of the tribe ' . We are the tribe ; through fumbling confusion of thought or evasion of reality , from day to day we devalue and deaden our words . The poet recreates them and in a spirit of play gives them back to us , alive again . Something similar can occur with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ideas . Most of us are now verbal and visual symbol consumers . The painter is still an image maker but as a visual symbol creator he has now been outpaced by graphic artists , anonymous package designers , film directors , and footnote 1 See Plate:i5.  | advertising men . In a way the easel painter is still the image maker of the tribe , but what he makes is now usually reduced and altered on the moving belt of mass-symbol production . Hundreds of thousands of people can enjoy good coloured postcard reproductions of modern paintings ; millions more can occasionally enjoy less faithful reproductions in the masscirculation weeklies . The graphic artist , the designer , and the ad-man are influenced by the easel painter on a stylistic level , and the easel painter is often influenced by their day-to-day choice of symbols . This is normal since their task , native to the environment , is to supply visual symbols to the symbol-consuming millions , to whom they also belong . They work as designers and they must foresee their end-product accurately and within a given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in neon lights . The easel painter can not foretell the appearance of his image until it , is completed . There was a time in the nineteenth century when ambitious painters went in for set-pieces or machines ' intended to dumbfound the spectator by a display of technical organization and efficiency . To achieve this type of work it was necessary to be businesslike , programmatic , and to keep the end-product well in view . In our eyes this cast-iron method is no longer worth pursuing . As the American painter , Corrado Marca-Relli has said , Everything is in motion , until the final touch ; everything is subject to modification by its neighbour until the very end . ' 1 For the easel painter the play element outweighs the task element in importance . During the ice-age both painter 's task and painter 's play were sacred . The task included a given theme , site , and materials . The interpretation of the theme , the use of materials , and above all the use of the site , were vitalized by the instinct of play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he asked to create visual symbols for his society . In spite of this the will to make images survives . THE PAINTER 'S PLAY In a curiously oblique way people are still ready to look at new footnote 1 Marca-Relli Paints a Picture ' : Art News , Nov. igSS.  | images and even absorb them because they are still needed . The painter is now his own taskmaster and his persona has acquired surprising elements of the surgeon , the explorer and the cook , among others . The Italian painter Burri probably considers his materials from a rather surgeonlike point of view . This is illustrated by an extract from the article Burri Makes a Picture ' in the American magazine Art News.I The plastic blobs on the protuberances had become tacky and it was time to proceed to their " slabbramento " , a term often used in the sense of " opening a wound " . With a palette knife incisions were made in the blobs along the curving ridge of the swellings , and the edges of the plastic were retracted and secured with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are usually a part of the painter 's creative play misinterpreted by self-conscious observers as an attempt to evade their critical pigeon-holing . The painter 's play develops with his time and environment but many art-lovers ' cling to devalued attitudes . One uses certain faculties to absorb a painting , faculties which can only be made poorer if they are not used every day on the things which surround us . Domestic appliances , advertisements , and people 's everyday gestures need not be placed in a caste system below that which includes sculptures , easel pictures , and mime . We ca n't withhold feelings for rare occasions and at the same time keep them alive . But many people think it necessary to have a special attitude in front of a fine-art object . A special attitude which is usually induced by a . device such as an elaborate picture-frame . This attitude is now vestigial , a remnant out of a vast wardrobe of gestures belonging to the clays when people wore wigs . In fact , as Huizinga points out , the practice of framing pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wigs in the seventeenth century.2 The frame is used to isolate the picture and pay homage to it as the wig frames the face and makes it appear nobler . It is very easy to detect the shrine-creating impulse at work in people 's houses , and the pin-up ' is just another proof of our need for images . The appearance of elaborate frames and glass footnoter Art News , Dec. 1954. 2 Homo Ludens.  | cases implies that the impulse has lost touch with reality and a special attitude ' is being fabricated . A curious example is the stuffed fish in a glass case . What could be more natural than to go fishing , catch something , and have a record of one 's catch ? It is equally natural to eat what one has caught , and photography might appear the obvious means of recording one 's catch . But this is not enough from the angler 's point of view , as a photograph is not the same as a trophy . So some people prefer to embalm the fish in a glass case rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several hours cleaning it , to let six weeks elapse while it dries , to spend another week mounting it , and finally to devote a great deal of time , labour , and expense to trying to make the embalmed fish look alive in its cumbersome glass case . A primitive impulse is concealed in a clumsy nineteenth-century illusionistic technique very much in sympathy with repository art . The extraordinary thing about the stuffed fish in a glass case is that the embalming and model-making techniques destroy all one 's awareness of the fish 's real nature and of the moment when it was snatched out of its element and died . The remnants are there but utterly disguised by the illusionistic faking . Japanese fishermen have their own way of making trophies . Known as Gyo-Take it consists of rubbing the catch with India ink and taking an impression before the ink dries . You can have your fish and eat it . The fish goes to the kitchen and a brief , tactile and lively image remains to be contemplated . Usually it is very difficult to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end-product ofthe process , the image , although it is becoming less difficult and less unusual than before . The image in the process of becoming is illustrated in another example from Japan , on the lid of a writing box by Shunsho . It represents a woman squirting black toothstain from her mouth on to a screen and writing the characters Koi-wo-shinobu or perseverence in love ' .1 One sees how the ideogram on the screen has assumed a particular form as a result of this painterly game with the tooth-stain straight from the woman 's mouth . Idea and form , thought and feeling are joined in footnote I See Plate i6.  | a calligraphy which uses no hand or instrument . This is creative technique at play and the image is found within the unusual limitations . A painter learns to be economical like a farmer , like a cook , and his equipment influences his development , impels him to work by arousing senses of smell and touch . The tubes and tins of colours , the bottles and containers of turpentine , oil , and varnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knives , and rags are a physical part of his environment , completed by the presence of the work in progress . This accumulated work is also a witness to be accepted or denounced . It is capable of crowding him out , forcing him to react , or nauseating him and making his life unbearable unless he renews himself . Whenever a person or a group of people absorb an image or a sign , they tend to modify , increase , or devalue its content , and some painters have been unable to overcome the crisis created by their devalued accumulated work or to reconcile themselves to their own limitations . They have killed themselves . Perhaps play had stopped ; it may have done so , or more probably the game had now become as some games are , one of life and death . Mr Wright showed slides of a number of pictures , a few of which are reproduced in this book . His paper produced a long and interesting discussion . He was asked how it is that modern paintings never seem to be finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two points arose from the answers and discussions about this question . ( I ) Today the painter suffers from an inhibiting sort of freedom . Commonly he is not commissioned ; he is asked to paint in no particular style or discipline ; there is no longer a clear integrated tradition or form within which he will naturally produce his work . He is not therefore a craftsman , in the sense that the eighteenth-century portrait painters were . But his work is still the ancient craft of symbol-making . Even when he is experimenting ' in the most unusual way he may succeed in producing valid symbols for his society . An obvious example , referred to a number of times during the symposium , is Mondrian , whose spatial geometry has had a strong influence on architecture , typography and industrial design .  | ( 2 ) No work of art is ever a finished ' work of art in the sense that an aeroplane is finished ' when all its parts are put together as they should be . The end of a work of art comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Wright himself and by Mr. Lewis , the poet . The painting is the record of the artist 's gestures , and part of his art is precisely knowing when to stop . When there is a highly specialized tradition it is possible to make of these gestures something which has the appearance of being finished ' , an achievement to which nothing more could be done . Such is the result of the highly disciplined traditional gestures of the Japanese calligraphist.  | ANTONIA WHITE Miss Antonia White , author of Frost in May and other novels , of which the most recent is Beyond the Glass , spoke of the problems which face the Christian novelist . THE inclusion of a novelist in this symposium is a generous admission that the novel , in spite of the impurity of its hybrid form , has some claim to be considered a work of art . The very nature of his material involves the Christian novelist in problems very different from those of Christians who work in a purer medium . Before dealing with his specific troubles , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Christian artists . Not only is it the one which preoccupies me personally more than any other , but it is the very one we are meeting here to discuss . And if there is one thing on which I desperately need some light , it is this very question of the status of art in human life , which for us can only be synonymous with Christian life . Almost since I was a child , I have been puzzled by the source and function of this strange activity called art . Where , if anywhere , does it fit into the Christian life ? Is it to be included among those symbolic talents which we are forbidden to bury in napkins ? Or does it come under the heading of that scandalizing right eye that must be plucked out if we are to enter into salvation ? The Gospel gives some guidance to those engaged in other occupations , to the shepherd and the fisherman , the tax-gatherer and the soldier , but never so much as mentions the artist . The Old Testament , it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plastic arts as to what they are to produce for the adornment of the temple , and thereby at least implies  | divine approval of art as a human occupation . But the New Testament seems to ignore the artist so completely that it does not even suggest whether his activity is legitimate or illegitimate . Yet every artist is aware of his odd , and possibly suspect , gift not merely as a powerful impulse but as an allegiance to which he feels bound . And that allegiance not only imposes strict laws on him but demands an engagement of his whole self comparable only to that of religion itself . These laws appear to have nothing to do with moral behaviour yet their transgression induces something remarkably like moral guilt in the artist who transgresses them . So strong is this sense that art is autonomous that St. Thomas Aquinas can speak of a crime being perpetrated against art by the artist when he intends to make a good work and produces a bad one . To what realm , then , does art belong ? It almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor the devil , with its own hierarchy of values and its own independent laws . Yet , for the Christian , this is a possibility he can not admit . May I leave abstract generalizations and state the problem in a very crude , concrete way as it might appear in actual human experience ? I hope you will forgive if , to do this , I quote a passage from one of my own novels . It describes the bewilderment of a very young girl , who , as a Catholic , believes that everything must have some moral or religious significance yet finds herself confronted with something that seems to have neither . What had begun to disturb her was the sense of a realm into which she penetrated now and then quite involuntarily and whose existence ( lid not seem to be officially recognized . And this realm , though it seemed to her to be connected sometimes with truth , sometimes with beauty , seemed to have no connection with morals . A poem might be the key to it , or some lovely sight or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it for no apparent reason , waiting to buy cakes in a stuffy shop or on those evenings in Paget 's Fold listening to the aunts ' gossip . During these experiences she was not aware of right ' or wrong ' : the words simply did not apply . How could they , since during these brief moments she was not aware of  | herself at all except as a kind of sensitive film ? If they came from God , why were they not accompanied by a rush of fervour and a desire to he better ? And if from the devil , why did they not provoke her to wicked thoughts and rebelliousness ? But they seemed to have no results ; if they left any wish at all , it was a desire somehow to express them . They seemed to be nothing but a sudden intensification of life and she could not control them in any way . Sometimes she had dared to hope that this was what Christ meant when I-le said : I came that you might have life and have it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this meant the supernatural life of grace , something abstract and mysterious which one believed by faith but did not feel , she put the idea away as blasphemous . That passage states the problem as it dimly presented itself to a girl of fifteen . Yet , in my own late fifties , I find myself no nearer a solution of it than she was . For a time , I believed I had found , if not a solution , at least an accommodation . Solution it could not be because it completely altered the terms of the problem by denying the priority of religion . During a long period , in which I completely renounced Catholic belief , I saw both art and religion as purely human activities , modes in which the human spirit expressed its profoundest intuitions of what Santayana calls the realm of essence . Which mode was chosen depended entirely on the natural bent of the individual . Art was perhaps the purest of all human activities since it aroused no desires , inculcated no dogmas , and incited not to action but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the saint was a kind of artist who used his own nature as his raw material . What made him one degree less pure was that he looked for some reward beyond the achievement itself . But since , for the past seventeen years , 1 have mercifully been back in the Church ? I hope , and believe , with a much deeper conviction of faith and what it implies ? the old problem is there as disturbingly as ever . For faith is not the cosy comforter the non-believer so often pretends to envy the believer . As Pere de Lubac so profoundly says in his preface to The Drama of Atheist Humanism : Faith disturbs us and continually upsets the beautiful  | balance of our mental conceptions and our social structures . Bursting into a world that perpetually tends to close in upon itself , God brings it the possibility of a harmony which is certainly superior but is to be attained only at the cost of a series of cleavages and struggles co-extensive with time itself . ' I would like now to come to the specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Christian artists . The first and most acute of these is not only his subject but the inevitable dichotomy between the way he perceives that subject as an artist and his reaction to it as a Christian . The second concerns his presentation of that subject which , in the modern world , is bound to be conditioned to some extent by extraneous things which do not trouble the painter , the sculptor , and the musician . Taking his first problem , the subject itself , this lands him straight on the mined territory of moral values . The raw material of his craft is nothing less than human behaviour . As a Christian , he can not regard human behaviour with the purely aesthetic interest of a painter confronted with a landscape . Yet , as a novelist , this is precisely what he wants to do . Indeed , things that shock him religiously , both in himself and others , often stimulate him far more than those that edify him . He delights in imperfection , in things as they are , not as they ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its flaws , inconsistencies , and weaknesses than in nature perfected through grace . I will give a rather sinister example of this dichotomy between one 's attitude as a Christian and one 's attitude as a novelist to the same piece of human behaviour . A great friend of mine died in peculiarly distressing circumstances and I had to break the news to her mother . The mother 's immediate reaction showed not a tinge of even apparent grief at her daughter 's death . All that she said was : And only last week I lent her five pounds . I do n't suppose I shall ever see that again . ' As a human being , I was naturally shocked . As a novelist , I was delighted at this sudden unguarded revelation of something I had never suspected in the mother 's character and which illuminated s  | all kinds of things in her relationship to her daughter that had puzzled me before . Moreover , was not my own behaviour far more unChristian and inhuman than that of the mother ? My grief over my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a novelist , over what I had perceived as a result of it . And that brings me straight back to my old original problem , the very nature of that peculiar , compelling , what one can call amoral mode of perception which distinguishes the artist 's consciousness from that of other people . When that mode of perception operates not on any outward appearance to which the terms good and evil do not apply but on human conduct itself , is it surprising if the Christian novelist sometimes wonders if he can only achieve salvation by plucking out his right eye ? He can not even compromise by putting a shade over that right eye when not actually engaged in writing a novel . For being a novelist is not a part-time acitivity confined to a certain number of hours spent at a desk . In a sense , one is writing most of one 's waking hours and quite a number of one 's sleeping ones , for dreams are highly interesting to that implacable right eye . Whereever the writer goes , whatever he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others with avid yet impersonal curiosity . It is accumulating a thousand invisible notes which are grist to the novelist 's mill . The novelist is not , as so many people imagine , consciously searching for material out of which to make a novel . Nor has he any intention of literally reproducing anything he has seen or heard , for that would reduce him to a mere reporter . What makes him any kind of artist , as opposed to a manufacturer of fiction as a saleable commodity , is precisely this peculiar awareness and ability to select and combine perceptions into an organic whole . And this brings me to the Christian novelist 's second problem , that of presentation . For , owing to the nature of his material , he can not simply present it as a shape or a pattern . Whether he likes it or not , since the novelist is dealing with human behaviour , human conflicts , human motives , he is bound to give some  | interpretation to these things . A painter does not have to interpret his subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelist has to do both . And since he himself is involved in the very predicament he is attempting to describe , the predicament of human life , he can not even momentarily stand apart from it and see it as pure form ; or , as Santayana would say , intuit it as pure essence . The poet can be caught up in a timeless moment in which he sees life sub specie aeternitatis and crystallizes that transcendental experience in a poem . The novelist is earthbound in that realm of existence which Santayana defines as such being as is in flux , conditioned by external relations and jostled by irrelevant events ' . The very nature of his work is not to crystallize , but to attempt to transcribe that very flux , while still immersed in it . True , the novel may have its transcendental moments , but the novelist can not possibly sustain the high temperature that burns away the dross of his own private obsessions and preoccupations . He simply can not avoid giving himself away . I doubt if anyone could deduce from any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believing Catholic . The Catholic novelist can not avoid betraying it . It is not a question of dragging ' religion into his work , or even of deliberately pushing it out . It is simply there , part of his preoccupation , part of his vision ; and part , only too likely , of his deepest private conflicts . And it is this last fact that exposes him to something he fears far more than being contemptuously dubbed one of the Catholic s quad ' or using the novel as a vehicle of religious propaganda . What a pity , ' a friend said to me , you have to spoil your novels by dragging in all that Catholic stuff . But I suppose your priests insist on it . ' In fact , the case is almost exactly the opposite . What the Christian novelist is far more likely to dread is that instead of being an apostle , he may be a Judas . Being himself such a struggling and very imperfect Christian , he may betray what is most sacred to him by his personal distortions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts will be projected into his work . In his religious life fear may predominate over love ,  | acceptance in principle go side by side with rebelliousness in practice . He may be willing to die for his faith yet barely attempt to live in charity with his fellow Christians . He can enter only too intimately into the consciousness of ' the sinner and he is probably unable to imagine , even dimly , the interior life of the saint . In view of these difficulties an eminent Catholic critic , Martin Turnell , goes so far as to advise modern Catholic novelists to keep religion out of their work and write only in a lighter vein , since when they grow serious , they come to grief ' . Yet surely this is a counsel of despair . For those who have no aptitude for the lighter vein ' ( can you imagine a light ' Mauriac or a light ' Julien Green ? ) this would mean giving up novel writing altogether . For the rest , it would mean side-stepping the problem by taking no risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply to the novelist , it was the man who took no risks whom the Master so ruthlessly condemned . All that I have said so far might apply to any Christian novelist in any age . My last two problems concern some of his troubles in our own . First , it is impossible for any Christian writer , and most of all for a Catholic , not to be self-conscious in an age which is not so much sceptical or agnostic as violently anti-supernatural . A young woman said to me the other day Religion embarrasses me just as some people are embarrassed by bad language . ' Now this self-consciousness , this feeling of being cut off from the main stream , is a very severe handicap to a novelist , since the novel is , above all , an attempt to communicate common experience to other human beings . I think it accounts for much of the violence and even clumsiness of the intrusion of the supernatural in modern novels by Catholics . The writer can not go into long explanations of what would once have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : to foreshorten , over-emphasize and distort in a way that upsets the balance of his work and creates a discordance between himself and his reader . For the novel is the one art whose content is accessible to everyone , though only a comparatively few may have the slightest appreciation of its form . Essentially , the novel is only an elaborated form of the told story , and people do  | not tell stories to themselves . A novel implies a reader , even if only one . The reader ? or listener ? will accept the wildest fantasies if they are presented as fantasies . He jibs when what seems to him fantastic is presented as truth , or when something which seems to him abnormal is assumed to be normal experience . This lack of common background between the Catholic novelist and his non-Catholic , very likely non-Christian , reader is particularly acute for anyone writing in English . In Europe , even the atheist knows the common terms of Catholic reference and understands , even if he does not accept , their implications . In England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not so much a question of rejection , as of uncomfortable bewilderment on the part of the reader . He feels the novelist is cheating him as much as if he suddenly introduced passages in a foreign language into his work . And this necessarily embarrasses the novelist and tends to make him ( especially as the chances are that he is a convert ) either over-aggressive or over-apologetic whenever he deals with religion . Secondly , he is faced not only with such a change in mental climate that religious belief now appears to many as an anachronism , but also with a revolution in psychology that has profoundly affected the moral one . The question of motive for any human act assumes a new and formidable aspect since we now know that the conscious motive may be only a deceptive mask for some very different unconscious desire . The great psychological novelists of the past , such as Dostoievsky and George Eliot have intuitively perceived this , but the modern novelist knows it more explicitly . Though lacking their genius , he can not revert entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its conscious desires . This is a problem common to all modern novelists , but a particularly thorny one to the Christian who is committed to a belief in free will . Yet , without accepting Freud 's determinism ( which , incidentally , sees both art and religion as sublimations of primitive impulses ) , he can not doubt the truth of many of Freud 's discoveries concerning the unconscious forces at work in human nature . If he has been analysed , he has become painfully aware of  | these dark forces in himself . And that knowledge must inevitably affect his interpretation of the characters he attempts to create . More than this , since one might almost call some form of psychological maladjustment the occupational disease of the novelist ( it may even be the very source of his faculty ) may he not infect his reader with his own sickness ? To some extent he is bound to project his own unconscious conflicts and fixations into his work . The theme he chooses ( or rather which he feels chooses him ) , the characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innermost preoccupations . Whether he studies his characters direct from life or fondly fancies he invents ' them , they will all be characters in his own private drama . Consciously or unconsciously , he involves the reader in that drama , forces him , in imagination , to act in it without the least idea what effect on him this will have . It is this question of influence , though usually stated in much simpler and more forthright terms , that brings the Christian novelist to his final problem ? the attitude of his co-religionists towards his work . There are still very many Catholics who judge a novel entirely on the question of whether or not it could conceivably give scandal ' and entirely ignore any other standards of criticism . A very eminent Catholic archbishop told me how , when dining with two ? also eminent ? members of the Irish clergy , he had talked enthusiastically about The Power and the Glory as one of the finest Catholic novels of the century , and met with a marked lack of response . This was not altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Censors who had banned the book in Ireland . Pushed to its logical extreme , this dread of giving scandal would prevent a conscientious Christian from writing anything but edifying tracts in fictional form . Indeed , after those terrible retreat sermons of my childhood on bad ' books , I used to wonder how Catholics ever dared write novels at all . For a bad ' book was any book which might even unintentionally cause any reader one moment of moral uneasiness or theological doubt . And the penalty for writing one was to remain in purgatory till the last  | copy of the offending book was out of circulation . Perhaps I may add , in parenthesis , that my own solitary attempt to write a novel which should be deliberately apostolic ended in disaster . It was confiscated at a point before my sinners had been sensationally converted into saints . Too frightened to explain my ultimate intentions , I was branded as a bad influence and asked to leave my convent school . This absurd incident was actually neither as absurd nor as irrelevant as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilt about writing that for nearly twenty years I never attempted to write another novel . Only two or three times in all those years did I even attempt , and then with tortured misgivings , to write anything of my own ' . I worked entirely to the order of others , producing magazine articles and advertising copy which involved no personal risk . Even to this day , this sense of guilt persists when I attempt to write a novel . I feel that , in spite of myself , something sinister and suspect will creep into my work and bring down the wrath of heaven and earth . It appears to me as a terrifying and dangerous task I would be only too thankful to be let off . Yet , if I do not write , I feel even more guilty . I am convinced that no amount of other work , even for the direct benefit of my neighbour , will absolve me from having shirked it . I can most truly say with Dr. Johnson that I write out of the terror of a guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to argue and reason about it , that I instinctively feel that this faculty of mine , however small , is something given me by God ? a responsibility which I can not evade . Dare I say that I even feel it is actually connected with my salvation , that in some way I shall be judged on what use I make of it . I do not simply mean that , as I am sure every Christian artist does , I pray about my work and at least try to do it honestly for God . I mean that God may somehow put my writing itself in the balance and perhaps excuse some of the egotism , vanity , irritability , sloth about good works and even common duties to which the writer is so prone . Yet , even if , as I so deeply hope , this symposium will establish  | art as a true function of Christian life , I do not expect to go away with all my problems solved . While not agreeing with Martin Turnell that belief destroys talent , the conflicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy perfection of form . Yet the novel has always mirrored conflict , not a vision of order and peace . Perhaps , by its very nature , it can never achieve the wholeness , harmony and radiance ' which , St. Thomas says , signalize the true work of art . Indeed , the deeper the novelist tries to go , the more truth as he perceives it he tries to include in his work , the more likely he is to mar the harmony and consistency of its formal pattern . In wrestling with his particular daimon , he is bound to be maimed in the fight . Yet , if the daimon be Jacob 's angel , though lame he may still be blessed . Miss White 's principal theme , the dichotomy between art and religion was central to all the discussion . Art requires the innocent eye ' ; but religion brings in a moral conscience to prejudice this innocent eye . Miss White said that she had written Frost in May at a time when she had ceased to be a believing Christian ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event of the safety-pin in the child 's ear had she been writing the novel as a practising Catholic . Those present were somewhat horrified at this fear of giving scandal and assured the novelist that her guilt feeling was not justified . After all the reassurances , equivalent to those of a kindly confessor , the novelist , like the dancer , was hardly satisfied . Her problem was that of Mauriac and Bernanos , and behind it lay the whole problem of the domestication of the supernatural , the special characteristic ofCatholicism . The conclusion of this discussion , as indeed of the whole symposium , was that art is indeed a true function of religion . But the artist must sing the song of his own age and ? to turn the sculptor 's words ? how can one sing an uncertain song with the certainty of faith ? The answer may perhaps be found in the final paper where it is implied that the artist 's vision , like the mystic 's , inspires hope rather than certainty . The man of prayer , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Discussions at the symposium turned more than once to Keats 's reference to the poet 's negative capability ' .  | PETER WATTS Mr. Peter Watts is a stone carver in Bath . He learnt his craft before the war ; after demobilization he chose to establish himself independently as a carver , working for a market which he describes as sectarian and regional ' ; he carves a great deal for churches , also for the needs of public bodies and an occasional private person in West of England districts where stone is still used . His witness is that of a man who earns his living as a sculptor . WE live in a world of ghosts where noise counts for more than silence , the name counts for more than the thing , the shadow is more regarded than the substance . Everything God makes has a stamp on it , the stamp of Being . God never repeats himself , and every stamp is different . Custard is a dish made from eggs , custard powder is quite another thing . Oolithic limestone is fossilized sea-bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same is again entirely different in substance . We like to fancy they are the same , we like to ignore God 's stamps . I believe that we are in danger of losing altogether our sense of the reality of earthly things . We jumble rocks and stones and trees together and call their appearance a landscape , a thing of shadows . We forget the separate identities these objects receive from their Creator , the Being they share with him . Before we can make anything ourselves , we must learn to see the things outside us as they really are ; that is , as things that God has made . Otherwise we shall be in danger of denying God . I am a carver and my theme is stone . God made stone to teach us something about his own strength ; his Church , he said , was to  | be made as impregnable as a Rock . We all know that stone decays , and may be blasted into smithereens . Whole hillsides may be carted away and ground into paste for spreading on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself is a creature of God , given us as a promise that he will be with us always , and also as a proof that he has been with us from the beginning of Time , for why else should he have so neatly packed it with little samples of his achievements from the protoplasm to the Peking man . No one should touch hammer and chisel who has not first of all studied the action of the elements on stone . The rain and the frost and the wash of the tides lay bare great crags and boulders which they then mould into shapes . These shapes disclose the structure of the stone , its bedding and its lines of fracture , essential knowledge to the carver . If he should then choose to carve stone into the shape of leaves or hands or hair , it will be almost as if they had appeared naturally by some freak of weathering . Substantially the forms will be stone forms . By looking at them you will learn little enough perhaps about the things they represent . But you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and what is more important still , something about the man who made them , himself a creature of God . I do n't mean geological facts or traits of character , I mean the much more important kind of learning ? I mean manliness and stoniness . It is the reality of Michelangelo and his marble , not the realism of David 's ear that counts . When I was a boy and returned year by year to school from holidays spent by the sea , I always carried with me in my pocket a small pebble picked at random from the shore . It spoke to me of the sea whenever I felt it or looked at it . All the power of the moving waters at their priest-like task seemed to be contained in that smooth hard shape . The sea had made it . It was a piece of stone , but also it bore the mark of the sea . Its shape had energy , the energy of a wave ; its surface had lustre , the lustre that aeons of pure ablution had bestowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to the south where I had found it , but  | this was only by association . This was sentimental , and I knew it . Any scrap of flotsam would have done as well to represent the place , and awaken wistful recollections . But the pebble had a higher sadness . The pebble was a sea-dirge , and all the sounding shores of the world reverberated in my ears . Its value as a souvenir was soon forgotten . The stone statue of the carver , then , has power to move us not by association with the subject , though we may find this pleasing and helpful , but by the way it reflects the carver 's own being through his sympathetic handling of the stone . The expression of the face , the attitude and proportions of the figure , may or may not correspond with our ideas of what is appropriate , but that is not the point . It is the shapes themselves that will proclaim the thing a masterpiece , a reality . And having once grasped the fact that for some mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a daffodil or a mountain , then its particular connexion with a subject no longer matters . We no longer worry that it should fail to represent clearly , when we discover to our joy that in a much larger sense it is that which it attempts to show . The ordinary plaster products of the repositories are not lacking in pious associations , the shop-windows where these are displayed positively exude the aura of piety like a chimney vapour . But because they have no true substance as things they have no part for the sculptor in the state of prayer . On the other hand , a Madonna by some virile Baroque master may be anything but pious . It will be more likely to remind us of my lady 's boudoir or the grand opera stage than of prie-dieus and gardens of the soul . But it was made by a man who had this much familiarity with the ways of God that he understood Making , and therefore it has the heavenly trade-mark upon it . It is a prayer to contemplate . I wish to repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message to be . We have grown heavy-handed and heavy-hearted with our love of science . We have lost the love of common things , the world is nothing but a dreary jumble of minerals . Cheese is only chalk with something added . The shadows crowd upon us and make everything look the same . We are so lost and confused  | that we can not tell what is and what is not . Indeed we no longer understand the verb to be ' . In this dark night it is the sculptor 's job to be a maker of sign-posts . I take this piece of stone , he says , and I make something and it is , and there you have a sign that God is and that I am and that the world is . From the day the cave-man first set up his image in the farthest recess of his labyrinthine home , the sculptor 's aim has been to imply no less than this . The primitive idol did not picture God , but in a sense it was God . You touched it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no escaping it . And as long as it stood there everything was right and there was always meat for breakfast . Sculpture , then , is heavy and uncompromising stuff , a hard and ponderous obstruction in the rabbit-run of progress , a load indeed upon the minds of those who like a clear scamper . We see it in municipal art galleries , in the halls of technical institutes and modern secondary schools , in the foyer of the press lord , in any place where there is an excess of funds private or public . We no longer touch it as we pass but we feel its challenge . It requires understanding , it demands of us that we live up to it . It has the insistent call of an influence like the spring to which the heart is lifted and responds . It calls us back to the soil , the furrow , the seed cast into the dark earth with hope , the harvest gathered in with joy . It is the ancient voice of the stone thing in the cave , the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agonies of birth and death and over the joys of maturity and fulfilment , for countless centuries before the coming of Christ . And then we think of mass education and daily papers and television critics , all the flitter and the flutter , the squeak and the gibber of modern existence , and more than ever it seems that unless we can learn to cherish the values of hard voluminous form , reality will soon be lost to our sight for ever . I have heard it said by those who delight in prophecies of gloom and doom that when civilizations decay the arts of sculpture and poetry are the first to perish . There is this much truth in it , that when you once abandon the search for form , whether in verse or stone , then the whole matrix of civilization loosens and begins  | to crumble . Where the love of form is strong , there you will be likely to find strong institutions , laws of justice , and a united people . If the poets and sculptors sicken and grow tired , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's life is near its end . I do not believe that it ever vanishes entirely , there are plenty of ' good things from the Hellenistic and Dark Ages and plenty in our own time as well . But it is no longer a source of strength , it has lost its binding power . The flowers of statuary and song grow rather among ruins that are well-founded than upon walls newraised in shifting sand . It is a time for sculpture . The days of ' public monuments are over temporarily , but this is a thing that can not be helped and does not greatly matter . From the arches of the late Emperors to the building of Vezelay there was a gap of six hundred years when no great monuments appeared in Europe , but there is enough Byzantine carving in Italy to prove that sculpture was far from dead . It was the work of the monks that kept it going , men devoted to training , training the heart , the mind , the hand , the eye , training the whole man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a lifetime upon one small task , watching the sense of form develop , generation after generation in a process so gradual that if an aged man could say , looking on the work of his youth , I can manage this leaf a little better now , a little better than the man who then taught me ' , he was satisfied . Thus , and thus only was the period of renaissance in the eleventh and twelfth centuries made possible . All this makes nonsense of the current theory that art grows , that it is organic to the soul and flourishes according to specific climate and environment ? flourishes like grass , in the rash declaration of one eminent critic ( with a disappointing crop of wild oats to his credit ) . If there are certain times when it appears to grow spontaneously , that is only because centuries of patient and assiduous exercise of the will have given it the roots . Again , if there are times when individual artists fly off the perch in obedience to what seems a blind impulse , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as a certainty of their  | being able to transcend the traditional laws . The present is most certainly not the time for encouraging the young to fly off the perch . Far from being able to transcend the laws few of them have more than a smattering of practice in them . Yet in many of our more progressive schools all the really laborious processes , such as carving , are being excluded , and quicker methods of working such as modelling freely in slow-drying cement are taking their place . The reason is of course to give impulse and caprice a freer rein , and the result is as morbidly chaotic as one might expect . It is a time for stiffening the sinews if we wish the sense of form to survive . To this end the technique of carving affords a most excellent discipline . You have before you an arbitrary mass of stone . You have to visualize within its boundaries a figure of compact and rhythmical shapes . By means of drawings , or sketch models cut from plaster or soft stone , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massing of this figure before you may make so much as one cut in the stone itself . When you do begin you must work all round , remembering that , unlike a sonnet or a piece of music , a statue is composed not in time but in space , and therefore has no beginning and no end , but is there whole and entire from the moment the carving begins . It may be that one view is more important than another in the sense that it will receive most attention , but such is the complexity of three-dimensional form that you will find with every fresh stage of the work the number of varying aspects has multiplied itself a hundredfold , and that you can not afford to neglect one of them . Eric Gill used to say that the work should look good right from the start . This is an attractive theory , but it depends much on the method of roughing out . I regret to say that my own method must be far from ideal , for I find my earliest results anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trying to fix the general position and proportion of the shapes , no joy like that of giving them final form and crispness . The work should have finish , but only just so much finish as is required to bring out the quality of the stone and give to it an air  | of completeness and authority . No amount of polish can make a dull work shine , but up to a point the value of a good work may be enhanced by it . These are the veriest platitudes of instruction such as any student of the arts will receive in his first term . Yet how often is the corruption of taste that abounds everywhere attributable to nothing but their neglect ! It is true to say , I think , that carving enforces a stricter adherence to these homely precepts than most other methods and media . You may get away with it ' in oils or in clay , but never in stone or wood ; just as you may get away with bad grammar in English or even in French , but never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having to work from the general to the particular without destroying the wholeness of the shape and without slurring the forms , is one that can not fail to have a good effect upon the intellect and outlook of the young student of carving . Set your pupil to work quickly and roughly in some shoddy material , he may produce ten results in the same time as it would take him to produce one in a good piece of stone . The results may be promising but they will give him no sense of achievement . I believe that one simply can not underrate the psychological value nowadays of this so-called sense of achievement . Millions suffer hardship daily without hope of victory or reward beyond the wage-packet . Mere hardship merely hardens . But to have wrestled with a task , to be brought face to face with an overwhelming mass of trials and perplexities and irrevocable decisions , to be beaten to one 's knees on the very verge of despair , to rise and return to the assault , and then suddenly to find the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine tempering process . Spent and exhausted but with the work before you coming swiftly now to its conclusion , you find the experience was supremely worth while , and you are satisfied ? for the moment . The mortal sickness of the world is non-fulfilment , which is the soul 's destruction . This it is that peoples all the land with ghosts , this it is that turns reality into a dance of shadows , a soft alluring fantasy in the antechamber of Death . Make something that shall stand in the doorway and have power to be , and you destroy the  | spell , you switch on the floodlight and the shadows vanish . One substantial achievement to the sculptor 's credit and he sees the world as God saw it on the seventh day . Yet how many of all the thousands in our art schools are ever given the chance to achieve anything final ? I went one day to the local academy to ask for the assistance of some experienced pupil in a simple matter of roughing-out . They shook their heads and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My ears are still ringing with the astounding reply that followed . They said : It is not our business to train craftsmen , but teachers of art . ' The old monk with his page of manuscript or his foliated capital was wiser , and his works remain . If anyone suggests that he might have been happier had he had greater opportunities for selfexpression , and that in this case his work would have seemed to us more human , more alive ? well the answer is that what made him so happy was the fact that he had no self and therefore no desire to express it , and that this very freedom made it possible for him to achieve an expression of serenity such as no one for over five hundred years has even approached . In silentio noctis , in the stillness of the Dark Ages , the nightingales were singing . Today it is all a clamour of rooks ; to be a voice is something , to croak above the rest is the all-in-all . What one chiefly notices is the lack of anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all making ! I have the pathetic memory of students coming to me with tools in their hands saying : What shall I carve , what shall I do ? ' I was always tempted to reply : Go home and help your mother with the washing-up ! ' Instead I felt greatly sympathetic , but could never bring myself to tell them quite bluntly that they had mistaken their vocation . They would never have believed me , anyway , they would have impressed upon me their certainty that they were called to art . In which case I should have had to explain to them that art was not a vocation in that sense at all , that if you became an artist it was not because you felt the call , but because you had something to say . Then they would have burst into tears and said that they only wanted to be teachers of art anyway .  | For my own part I have to admit that I never felt the call of art , least of all did I feel drawn to sculpture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a poet or a playwright or an actor or a journalist or a painter or an architect or a designer of stainedglass windows , because I thought that in any one of these trades I could work for a whole lifetime without drying up . It was only a chance acquaintance with a hammer and chisel that decided me , and the fact that stone was handy in these parts . What should I carve ? Kings and prophets and saints of course , and the curious little comedies of everyday life that were enacted beside them in the branching capitals . Wells was a short bicycle ride , and there were pictures of Chartres and Vezelay in the library of the school where I worked . The fact that five hundred years separated me from this wonderful tradition did not alarm me in the least , nor did the danger of being sneered at as a mediaevalist deter me . It was the only work of the district that was any good ; it was every bit as lively as Chaucer and the thought of it made you sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cider orchards below Dulcote hill . The old master-masons were centuries dead , but when I took up the trade and learned it with the screech of modern machinery in my ears , I always had their example in mind . Believing in the same essential truths , working the same stone and with very similar tools , I was never once conscious of the immense gulf of time . I just wanted to carry on in the same spirit . London , in spite of its ugliness and grim bustle , is a European not an English capital . I went there and worked in studios , in stone-yards and in the schools . The master-masons of Somerset seemed very small and very far away . Very near me instead were the most enormous and unapproachable wonders , things that threatened to crush me like a worm whenever I stood by them . When Keats first saw the Elgin marbles it was mortality that weighed him down . But they were his kindred and his was the agony of a master-spirit delivered too late into the world . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him like everything else he loved , poor fellow . When I saw the great Theseus fragment from the Parthenon pediment it was my total  | lack of any possible claim to kinship with it that distressed me . If this was sculpture where was I ? It was god-like in its posture and in its shapes , even the knee was god-like and carved by a god too , or by some creature who would never have recognized me as a man , but would have spurned me as an insect . Yet a mild-faced official came and talked about it in a reedy voice exactly as we have heard doctors talk to their students about the patient on the table . One might have asked him , if only one had thought of it , what had the Parthenon and Wells Cathedral in common with each other . In my mind 's ear I seem to hear an embarrassed snigger as the only reply . Had the world gone differently , had it been an earlier Parthenon and a later Wells ? who knows ? But as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? each was a moment in time and place . And 1 was another ? another moment in time , that is ? but my place was Wells . London was a great vacuum where time and place were suspended and only talk went on ; on and on past midnight , trivial , fragmentary , and over-serious , with nothing of the jovial intimacy of real discussion . In the room the women come and go Talking of Michelangelo ... . Yes , and of Mino of Fiesole , too , and the Pisans , Giovanni and Niccolo , of Jacopo the Oak Man , of Ghiberti and Donatello the twin marvels . Yes , there was no denying it , Rome had conquered the world a second time , not with soldiers , but with sculptors and painters . Who then dared talk of Wells , of Dinder and Croscombe and Compton Martin , and ? the ruined glory of them all ? Glastonbury ? From the day that Torrigiani landed , Torrigiani the bruiser who broke Michelangelo 's nose with a blow of his fist , whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chapel at Westminster , from that day onwards the master-masons were finished , cut off in their prime just as the English Renaissance was flowering again after the troubles of the fifteenth century , as it had flowered a hundred years earlier after the Black Death , but this time with promise of unprecedented glory . Forced to work , as at Hampton Court , under the supervision of  | Italians . Forced , as in this part of the country , to accept the plans of upstart amateurs like Thynne and Sharrington . Forced to become dry and studious and second-rate , the lost provincials once again of a world empire . There had been a time , of course , when England was really herself , and that was when the official language was still French . The Canter/mg Tales and Wells Cathedral were both essays in the art of being English . Unsuccessful as art perhaps , but positive and searching as expressions of what it felt like to be in England now that April was here . Obviously , it seemed to me , that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspiring to do . It was not an original idea ; certainly there had been others , far better men than myself , who had tried , who had failed gloriously , and who were now labelled as cranks . Looking back , indeed , it seemed as though the past was strewn with failures in this very field , from about the year 18 , ro onwards . William Morris , for example , so prolific , so versatile , so expert in all he did , and yet at the same time so slight and superficial and unconvincing . Enthusiasm run riot , no strong basis of reality , a sentimental outlook that made him think of all men as brothers in art , it was so easy to find the reasons for his failure . Much less obvious to account for was his true greatness , his victory over the second-rate . It was this , that whereas he had a blurred vision of his fellow-beings as one great family , he had a brilliantly clear and level vision of all the rest of Creation . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did see the world as God saw it on the seventh day . He saw everything separately , and he saw right into each thing , he understood its very being . Rocks and stones and trees and grass and fabric and flowers . But there were depths in himself which he feared and covered up . Provided I could overcome the fear of self , and provided that I did not expect miracles of enlightenment in those about me , that , I thought , was the sort of sculptor I should wish to be . At least a glorious failure . The only alternative was to go abroad , like Alfred Stevens , and spend years studying the finest examples in the world , to make myself a kind of composite master of masters ,  | and then to come home and produce something utterly beautiful and utterly dead , like the Wellington Monument . I had no ambition at all in that direction . What I wanted above all was to realize the fruits of my boyhood in Somerset and my Benedictine upbringing which taught me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this meant working in the spirit of that ancient tradition which the monks had so carefully fostered and tended , and which had rooted like the wild rose in all the little villages about the Mendips . From the worldly point of view this meant also limiting myself to regional and sectarian interests . I could never represent the age or the nation as a whole , fulfil the Zeitgeist as I believe they call it . Why ? Because the spirit of the age was one of scientific inquiry , and of doubtful speculation not upon the nature of transcendental things but upon the possibility of their existence . How was it possible to be certain , as I was , in a spirit of uncertainty , the prevailing spirit ? I was trying to see nature as God-made , others were trying to see it as if it had been made by themselves in a dream which might or might not turn out to be true . There was much to admire in the splendid flights of fancy of some of our leading contemporaries , though an equal admiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was not for me to emulate them , I had another job to do . If I can tell chalk from cheese , I thought , I shall remain here with the Somerset mud on my boots and prove that immortal difference to the laggards and the yokels . We are all fond of laggards and yokels , as much as we all detest the Common Man , that overbearing autocrat who is for ever trying to grind us down into a polished uniformity . There was a time when the Common Man was a foolish and endearing sort of character , A commonplace type with a stick and a pipe and a half-bred black-and-tan ' . But he has now abandoned these simple attributes and has acquired a new and sinister dignity in cap and gown . He has no religion , of course , but he has a compact and compendious philosophy and the Great Mystery holds no terrors for him . A severe fundamentalist at heart , he likes to reduce  | everything to a basic simplicity of form , especially in the matter of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But being entirely innocent of prejudice , which is reactionary , he has no very rigid preferences in painting and sculpture . The Common Man knows all about Art , but he does not know what he likes . He merely appreciates what he knows . And the sculpture he knows and therefore appreciates the best is that which the Daily Blurb calls abstract ' and the weekly Onlooker calls non-figurative ' , although my own name for it is Basic Sculpture . How well it suits the Common Man this nice adjustment of political idealism to the world of art ! Sculpture with its Greek heroes and its Gothic saints , its disturbing symbolism , its awkward fuss of gesture and expression , always seemed to him the most untidy and unhealthy of the arts . How satisfying to have it all cleaned up and set in order , purged of all those uncomfortable associations , reduced to a smooth hygienic drama of shapes ! How soothing to the jaded nervous system , how full of meaning to the subconscious mind ! You see , the Common Man likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing depends on a formula , which to him is always the complete answer to everything . He likes the formula to take the place of the subject because he is far readier to appreciate the roundness of the statement x2 ? y2= ( x+y ) ( x ? y ) , than he is to understand the jagged meaning of I am the Resurrection and the Life ' . This is an example of his short-sightedness , for you have only to repeat the formula twice and it becomes a cliche , whereas the text will never become a platitude . So on the whole I think it fairly certain that Basic Sculpture , whatever its official favour at the moment and however it may please the Common Man , is doomed to pass away from sheer dryness , and that within as short a space of time as it takes the simple inventive faculty of the human brain to exhaust itself . If we see a work that we particularly like , we do not immediately inquire about the subject , it is of secondary importance to us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure which is so striking that there can be no doubt as to the  | artist 's meaning . Later when we come to associate that meaning with a title , we may find the connexion interesting or not as the case may be , but it will anyway have little or no effect upon our judgment of the work per se . It would be reasonable to suppose , then , that subject-matter is of secondary importance to the artist also , and that he generally makes up his composition first and then works-in the necessary associations . I have no doubt that figure-subjects done for exhibition at the Academy have frequently been dished up in this way , with subject interest added for spice at the end . It is a matter of personal taste or habit and I have no wish to decry the methods of highly skilled and gifted composers in sculpture . It would certainly not suit me , and my sort of work , because if I am asked by a priest to make a statue of St. John the Baptist , say , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjunction with each other : namely , the subject of the statue , and the requirements of its place in the church . The first is a pile of dry tinder to set my bonfire alight , the second is a lengthy prong to stir it and keep it under control . I have never been able to understand how anyone could get started without the inspiration of a subject to make a brisk flame . And yet I have seen men labouring heavily at compositions with no care at all for subject , but from sheer habit of exercise , like the men one used to see in the early morning running round Battersea Park . There is , as Mr. Christopher Fry has cruelly observed , a dreariness in dedicated spirits , they burn so slowly . Sculpture is one of the most boring subjects in the world to write about , especially for someone like myself who has the excitement of actually doing it every day . I have tried to keep this paper interesting , and I am very conscious of the fact that in doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case the whole truth can never be known , the last word can never be said . There is a great deal I should like to be able to say , but I can not find the words . There is the dark side , without which of course all sculpture would fall flat . I can not touch upon that side , indeed I have only recently become aware of its existence . It has to do with oneself , and it adds very considerably to one 's difficulties . The  | funny thing is that there seems to be no way round it , but no sooner have you realized that a dark and unexplored place exists than you must go through it . I go through , and I find it is just like becoming a helpless novice again . There is an awful struggle in the stone of something trying to come , and after hours of fruitless effort I begin to think that the end is near and the stone must be abandoned . Then a quiet ride home on my bicycle , working at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night perhaps , a steady attack all the next morning ? and we have things under control again . But it will not be quite what I had hoped . I am sure it is the same with all our work . We are creatures of God and we are haunted by images of perfection . If all our experience could be summed up in a single phrase , a song , a figure , a sonnet , it would still fall far short of that transfigured summary in the mind which has neither word nor shape nor music , but is a source of perpetual energy like a spring of water in the hills . We store experience as the hills store rain , and deep inside us a great pressure is built up , until out through a crevice of the rocks it comes , not as it fell from the sky in leaden misty drops , but in a leaping crystal stream . With the power of this spouting well of joy we work . We grind away at our material with that peculiar transforming instinct of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholeness into parts , from a separation and a refinement , from a pounding in the press , from an annealing in the furnace , a fresh wholeness is made , something useful for the sustaining of our lives . We cut into the loaf , we taste the wine , and we are disappointed . Something has gone wrong and the stuff is not as good as it should be , it has the musty odour of death about it . We can do nothing to improve it , but we are like children and we desire some sort of assurance that what we have done wrong can eventually be put right . So we take the result of all our pains , we take our imperfect crust and our faulty vintage , and we go into the church with them , and in fear and trembling we offer them to God . And God in his great mercy takes them and has a look at them , and then he gives them back to us again AS THEY SHOULD BE .  | CRITICIZING THE ARTS In this section an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what is the artistic function of each . This work of criticism was extended , in the last two papers , to the way in which these functions impinge on the human person , physiologically and psychologically.  | ALEC ROBERTSON From his long experience of writing , lecturing and broadcasting about music , Alec Robertson contributed this paper on the medium of f music . SCHUMANN had just finished playing a new and as yet untitled composition to a friend . What does it mean ? ' said the friend , rather puzzled by the piece . It means this ' , Schumann replied , and played it again . This little incident contains , really , the essence of what I want to say . If music is a language , with its own special methods of articulation and expression , it must have meaning : and that meaning can only lie in the ordered sounds of a composition , not , in the final analysis , in anything extra-musical . If , therefore , Schumann afterwards called his piece Dreaming he added nothing to the music but merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prod to the imagination of the listener . Richard Strauss also called one of his piano pieces Dreaming . What is the difference between the two ? 1 If there were two poems about dreams , let us say , Come to me in my dreams and then by day I shall be well again ' ( Matthew Arnold ) and I dreamt that I dwelt in marble halls ' ( Alfred Bunn ) , one could easily describe the difference between the two by paraphrasing the words . But music , as Goethe said , begins where words leave off , and we have to seek the difference in sounds , not in concepts . That difference could be expressed technically ? one relies on footnote1 A number of points in this paper were illustrated by musical examples which unfortunately can not be reproduced here .  | melodic line , the other on harmony ? but however expressed it is a difference apprehended by the mind , reported to by the senses : mental activity followed by emotional response . Now it has been said ad nauseam that the expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems necessary to emphasize that the emotional or signal ingredient is practically the only nonartistic material left in music , and so it attracts more attention here than in the other arts , to the detriment of aesthetic considerations ' . This last sentence is a quotation from an article by Hans Tischler , in The Music Review of August 1956 , on the aesthetic experience ' which itself quotes largely from Susan Langer 's remarkable book , Philosophy in a New Key . In what I have to say I gratefully acknowledge a debt to both authors . For the moment I will add this one further quotation : In music those that react only to the emotional implications of a composition can be well said to have had hardly any aesthetic appreciation of the work but only of the performance . They are often good judges of performers and conductors but much less successful in criticising a composition . ' One has only to listen for a while to the chatter in the vestibule of a concert hall or to the conversation of gramophone record collectors to discover the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for priggish disdain . People must be free to enjoy music in their own way since it eludes verbal description , other than technical , except of a vague kind . One can not know just what the ordinary listener does experience mentally or intuitively . He can not express it in words , but it may have been a real communication . Let us remember that Art happens ' , as Carlyle said , in palace or hovel ' and the widespread dissemination of music today has made that saying more meaningful than it ever can have been . Its results are often inspiring . Only a few months ago I heard a porter at a small junction station in Sussex say to the woman in the refreshment room , I 'm saving up for Leonora No. 3 ' , and it was Beethoven , on L.P. , he meant , not polygamy ! One often hears people say today , I 'm going to see so-and-so , ' referring to this or that artist , conductors especially , the composer  | only being mentioned thereafter . But music is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea , in their publicity methods , that the composer exists for the glorification of conductor , singer , or instrumentalist ? an idea occasionally shared by these same people ? and of course human personality , even if second rate , is a matter of absorbing interest . But every genuine artist knows , with humility , that he is only a means ( the only means , in this context ) to an end : and the end is the communication of musical ideas by way of symbols , these ideas being produced by an intellectual process . Hence , as Mr. Tischler says , to speak of music as the art of feeling or emotion is , therefore , a contradiction in terms , for any work of art , like the solution of a mathematical problem or the presentation of a philosophical idea , is an intellectual attainment ' . This is by no means a new idea . St. Augustine spoke of music , in the well-known phrase , as Musica est scientia bene modulandi , that is , a science of shaping music as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a matter of feeling or emotion . Plato , and Aristotle whose outlook was more liberal , had earlier reached the same conclusion . At the same time St. Augustine , though disturbed by his own delight in the sensuous sound of voices singing in church , allows full value to the pleasure content of music and never advises the readers of De Musica to beware of pleasure as such ' . I In A Composer 's World , Paul Hindemith has usefully summarized St. Augustine 's exposition ( in De musica libri sex ) of musical perception and understanding , showing that musical impressions are by no means simple reactions to external stimuli but a complex mixture of diverse occurrences . First there is the mere physical fact of sound . . . indispensable as a basic experience before the perception and mental absorption of music can take place ; second , there is our faculty of hearing , the physiological fact that sound waves act upon our ear and , by muscular and nervous transmission , release reactions in the brain 's centre of hearing . Third , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erik Routley : The Church and Music ( Duckworth , 19So ) .  | the stimulus of music actually sounded or without recollective reference to a definite former impression . Fourth , there is our ability to uncover previous musical experiences , stored in our memory like old keepsakes , to draw them out of their hiding places , revive them mentally , and allow them to impress us with the same intensity as actual music would do , after which they may again be put to rest in the storage chests of our soul . In all these musical happenings both our corporeal and mental nature participate , with the emphasis constantly shifting from one to the other . Fifth , our mental activity must rise to predominance ; we must in the moment of actual perception or of soundless concept subject the musical substance to an intellectual examination and judge its musical shape and grade . Thus the mere activity of perceiving or imagining music is combined with the satisfaction we derive from classifying and evaluating it . But we must not become slaves of this enjoyable satisfaction ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind is not an end in itself . It is an image of a higher order which we are permitted to receive if we proceed one step further to the sixth degree on our scale of musical assimilation if we put our enjoyment of such knowledge ( enjoyment , the weight of the soul ) into the side of the balance that tends towards the order of the heavens and towards the unification of our soul with the divine principle . ) The philosophical approach , thus summarized , may indeed seem formidable and it raises difficult questions in regard to an art of music so much more complex and diverse that St. Augustine could have imagined . At the same time we must remember that he means by musica those arts that use sounds as their basis of expression ; and so poetry is included , though music itself is obviously the art most prominent in his mind . After this apparent , though I hope it is a relevant , detour , I return to my main thesis . Music is a language , expressing ideas without concepts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real business of loving and possessing music ( just as of creating it ) is done in one 's mind if it is done at all ' . Everyone who listens , who really listens to music , does , even if footnote1 Paul Hindemith : A Composer 's World ( Oxford University Press , 1952 ) .  | intermittently , think with it and follow its logic To give a simple example . When some obvious vital tune carries us off our feet ? let us say the big tune in Tchaikovsky 's Romeo and Juliet overture ? we become airborne with it ? up we go with the upward going strings to be carried along each curve of the tune . You do not stop to register your emotional involvement with the tune , or consciously to analyse it ? but in listening to the temporal succession of notes , heard in phrases , you have in fact related every note to the next one ? or the tune would not make sense ; and when , on the way home , you find yourself humming that tune you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider aspects , lies the whole art of listening , and when we do this we exercise those powers of concentration and recognition through which this chronological art becomes intelligible to us . Music is , therefore , even at its most sensuous , in some degree an intellectual pleasure . Music , however , is not all tune : this is what disappointed the charlady who said , elliptically , I like classical when it starts , but not when it goes on ! ' Popular music makes its appeal by depending only on tune and rhythm , often of the most obvious kind , with , indeed , some harmonic decorations derived from serious music ; but the actual tune material ? in the popular sense ? in the extended forms of sonata or symphony ? is small . How disappointing for the light-minded public that Beethoven should begin the Eroica Symphony ( if ever they happened to listen to it ) with what promises to be a beguiling tune , but which is abruptly halted on a D flat . Music for the millions , that deceptive phrase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting chunks from the living body and throwing them , often thoroughly vulgarized , to the people , an operation performed by men with reverence only for material gain , men who , in different ways , may yet destroy Western civilization with the atom bomb of triviality . It is time now to determine how music , as a language , differs from the language of the other arts . It shares two things with them ? form and rhythm ? but this most intangible of the arts uses these  | in a way that renders analysis , very useful up to a point , finally a dead end . In its temporal succession of material there is of course a correspondence between music and literature . We do not see ' a play as a whole , or anything read to us , until the end is reached , and so with a piece of music : but whereas , as I have said before , literary material is related to concepts , musical material is not . Hence the art of music has been called , above all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex work repetition or recourse to the printed score is a necessity . There is no correspondence between the characters in a play and the thematic material of a symphony , as a moment 's thought will show . Each follows different laws of development . It would be very odd if the characters in the first act of a drama suddenly began to say , even if in somewhat different terms , ' what they had said at the start of the act , and even odder if they disappeared and new sets of characters appeared in each of the three subsequent acts ; nor has the analogy really any more validity if the symphony be of the cyclic kind , or if it is a matter of theme and variations . Music articulates form in a way unique to itself . Furthermore , its material is presented horizontally and vertically , in the two dimensions of melody and harmony , and in counter-point arising out of combined horizontal lines , one of music 's greatest glories . We speak , by analogy , of tone-colour in music , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others , have spoken of the colour of different keys . To him D minor was dark brown ? but in fact the analogy is no more than a convenient method of allusion , as it is in speaking of the colour of words : the purple passage . This or that instrument is chosen by a composer because of its tonal characteristics , and a musical idea may be at once conceived as a piano thought or a violin thought or for this or that medium as a whole , orchestra or string quartet . Limitations now appear . It was no use , in the eighteenth century , writing notes for the valveless horn or trumpet that could not be played , or  | today writing in a key that will take instruments outside their compass . In this matter composers have often made a virtue of necessity . Thus Mozart , in the first aria of Donna Elvira in Don Giovanni writes a certain phrase in the key of the dominant , as the convention of the time required . When this strain is due to re-appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soprano , had Mozart repeated the pattern , would have been compelled to sing notes which instrumentally would have offered no difficulty , but would be a strain vocally , so Mozart hit on a wonderful subterfuge , and the whole piece gains from the discipline . I have said that analogies between themes and characters in a play will not hold good , nor will that between the form of a play and that of a symphony , nor that from the metaphorical use of colour for the tone of instruments , nor , to return to form , can we equate form with architecture . Since musical form is fluid it is absurd to speak of architecture as frozen music . Browning 's description of a fugue in Master Hugues of Saxe-Gotha ' is ingenious , but tells us nothing at all significant ; it is merely picturesque and makes one doubt that Browning had ever really heard a fugue . What with affirming , denying , Holding , risposting , subjoining , All 's like . . . it 's like . . . for an instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its gilt moulding and groining Under those spider-webs lying ! As Ernest Newman has lately said , no poet has ever done more than say how music affects him , and no one could really do more except , to go back to Schumann , by saying this is what it means or is ' , by playing it . Form and content are identical in music , by which I do not mean formal form ? the conventional blue-print of A. B. A. , the minuet and trio let us say ? but the shape that phrases take therein . Out of such phrases tonal structures are built up from the simplest to the most complex . In this matter form , like rhythm , each according to its medium , is common to all the arts .  | We have now to consider the part of composer , performer , and listener in a piece of music , and follow with a practical demonstration . The composer , obviously enough , regards his work as an intellectual task , based on technical craftsmanship . I do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suspect that Beethoven , with insistence on the dignity of his craft , stressed the distinction . Anything internal or external may be the starting-point of creation , the waving of a tree in the wind , the song of a bird , any natural phenomenon , any material or spiritual experience . Are the composer 's feelings , however inspired , what the music expresses , or are they those of the performer , or the listener himself reacting to the stimulus of music ? Hindemith declares that music can not express the composer 's feelings . In writing , over a space of several months , a funereal piece , are we to imagine , he says , the composer to have been thinking of nothing but funerals , or more absurdly , to have felt grief as a starting-point only . Here , Hindemith says , is what he really does : He knows by experience that certain patterns of tone-setting correspond with certain emotional reactions on the listener 's part . Writing these patterns frequently and finding his observations confirmed , in anticipating the listener 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation , and is not only reproducing the feelings of other individuals , but is actually having these same feelings , being obsessed by them whenever he thinks he needs them , and being urged to express them with each stroke of his ever ready pen . Consequently he does not express his own feelings in his music . This analysis obviously needs qualification . Keats said he never wrote a single line of poetry with the least shadow of public thought : Bach would have said the same . Handel , on the other hand , a composer of the theatre , always had a finger on the pulse of the public . Hindemith has certainly described the attitude of the composer who must pay special regard to his public , but he forgets , it seems to me , the instinctive nature of the artist and the despotic nature of art which , as Maritain has said , demands the  | whole strength and intelligence of the composer 's manhood in the service of the thing he is making . Haydn and Mozart , for example , took heed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes laughed at them and sometimes ? indeed very often ? superbly transcended them . Musica scientia est bene modulandi ; the process of creation is a science , one of continual calculation , a mathematical process ; the rhythms , the melody , the harmony , the combination of melodies , the key sequences , the evolving form , all have to be brought into a just relation . A composition , once again , is therefore an intellectual attainment . Let us not worry about what feelings the composer has or has not . The performer , for his part , has quite simply to try to interpret the composer , not himself . The introduction of his own feelings can only distort a work . And the listener ? One can say at once that he must try to approach a work with a mind like a clean slate . The enormously suggestive power of music , emotionally , combined with emotional experiences of the day or of his life , makes this no easy matter . All too easily he may be using the music he overhears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so he hears , in fact , nothing but stimulating sounds . Every serious listener to music has to work out his technique of listening , with honesty and true humility . There is or is not a cultivatable field of music in individuals that either can be left fallow by those who are content to be emotionally moved by music , or can be cultivated rationally . The possibilities , so far as they can be systematized , have been stated by a Swiss author , Dr. Odier , as follows : ( 1 ) Those whose pleasure in hearing music depends on their technical knowledge of the art . ( 2 ) Those who , consciously or unconsciously , substitute images for sounds . ( 3 ) Those whose pleasure depends on sentiments or emotions with which they are inspired ' or which they find in the music . ( q . ) Those whose pleasure depends on ideas or thoughts suggested by the music .  | ( 5 ) Those who experience an emotion sui generis and not to be compared with any other psychological phenomenon : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed in other terms . The best listener , the conclusion is , will be he who has experienced each of these stages . I would add to this analysis that an intelligent listener might be expected to ascend from sensuous to aesthetic emotion , and finally to spiritual awareness . The reader may put the matter to practical demonstration , since a bar of music is worth pages of foolscap . First of all let him listen to a piece of music that is concerned with nothing outside itself , the first movement of Haydn 's London Symphony . It is its meaning . Here is articulated form . What should the listener perceive ? The musical language of the piece makes it referable to the listener 's experience ; there is no difficulty here and he should have acquired some awareness of eighteenth-century conventions . Does he follow the meaning of the music ? Now let me take a piece of music which though perfectly intelligible in itself yet testifies to something beyond itself , the second movement of Beethoven 's 4th Piano Concerto . There is no stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for explanation by the inquiring mind . Here there is a special call upon the imagination . Blake said that man 's desires are governed by his perceptions , no man can desire what he has not perceived . So he may not desire to receive more than a certain sensuous or emotional satisfaction from these pieces and be content with that . Music for him will not be a language that conveys meaning , and for him the craftsman will have laboured in vain . But in saying this , one must never forget that there are listeners , if few , who in some way that can not be explained do intuitively reach the heart of the matter . I can not take the matter further , but must pass on now to final considerations : the moral and spiritual values of music . It was , as we saw , an Augustinian precept that our mind absorbs music and transforms it into moral strength . This raises  | issues too large to be more than touched on here . A work of art may be aesthetically good and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar illustration , aesthetically bad church art , say a Mass by the deplorable Augustus Tozer , or Gounod 's Catholicism sucre , may bring an access of moral strength to the simple anaesthetically-minded listener ; so can , presumably , one of those commercial ballads the Americans call religioso , in which great spiritual themes are nauseatingly vulgarized . But music itself can in no way be morally bad ? and of no other art can that be said . It should be remembered that the denunciations of the Fathers of the Church were directed against the associations of certain instruments as used by the pagans , and against the words of their songs , just as Tolstoy 's outburst in his celebrated essay What is Art ? was directed against all the filthy operettas , songs and ballads with which our world teems . . . with the object of disseminating vice as widely as possible ' . He came to the conclusion that it would be better for the Christian world to be deprived of all then esteemed to be art and , together with the false , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called as witnesses Plato , the Fathers of the early Christian Church , and Mohammedan teachers ! This condemnation can only be applied to music that is committed to words , or a programme , but it at once raises a difficult question for the Christian moralist . Is a work aesthetically good , but , as he sees it , morally bad in its subject-matter , to be banned to right-living Christians ? The Anglican and Nonconformist preachers , and no doubt the Catholics too , thought so when Verdi 's opera La Traviata came to London . It was hotly denounced , but the faithful yearned to see it . So ? and how English this is ! ? a concert performance was given at that home of Nonconformity , Exeter Hall in the Strand , thereby inspiring a lampoon that ended : God bless our happy land What 's sin in the Haymarket is religion in the Strand . And what of Wagner 's Tristan or Strauss 's Salome , which hardly exhibit virtue triumphant .  | I once found myself sitting next to two nuns at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Munich and could not refrain from asking them , when we were chatting in the interval , how they came to be present at this particular opera . They fluttered their eyelids and murmured that it was educational ! As a matter of fact they were right . It is a great masterpiece and like all such is not to be placed an an index expurgatorius . This brings me to the point of these present reflections . There is always between the listener and the work a certain psychical distance ' separating the object and its appeal from one 's own self . This does not imply an impersonal , purely intellectually interested relationship ; on the contrary , it describes a personal reaction , often highly emotionally coloured ? its peculiarity lies in that it has been cleared of the practical concrete nature of its appeal . The content has been symbolized for us , what it invites is not emotional response , but insight . ' That goodness inhabits great music is a fact thousands have experienced , and from it many have found an access of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , after listening to Beethoven 's C sharp minor String Quartet , Well , if it 's like that , everything is all right . ' In its humble way this was no less a revelation than that received from a divine source by Mother Julian of Norwich : all will be well , and all manner of thing will be well . ' I conclude that music in itself can not be evil ? Salome 's possession of the head of John the Baptist calls forth merely romantic lyricism from Strauss ? unless deliberately prostituted to evil ends by extra-musical additions : words and gestures and so forth . Music is therefore the most spiritual of the arts . In this very fact lies a danger . Cardinal Newman , in a sermon recently printed , said the great danger Christianity might have to face was of a world purely irreligious . The danger is with us now . We are indeed the children of the Renaissance . Medieval art ' , it has been said , ' aimed at interpreting life and elevating man . Renaissance art aimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as St. Thomas Aquinas said , if man deprives himself of the things of the spirit he will go over to the things of the flesh . With a  | cynical contempt for the soul , evil men today do everything in their power to accelerate this process . At the same time thousands hungering for a religion of some sort turn to music . Tchaikovsky , living without faith or hope , had a clear vision of what this meant : that sadness , that dissatisfaction , that undefined aspiration towards an undefined ideal . . . that capacity for finding only in music the answer to vital problems ? we swim on the shoreless sea of scepticism , looking for a harbour we never find . ' No , that is not wholly true . Art is not religion , but it is one of God 's most wonderful gifts to man and it can most certainly be a help on the way to him if rightly used . Made into an idol it will perhaps end by betraying its worshipper . Michelangelo spoke of the illusion that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither painting nor sculpture is any longer capable of calming the soul turned towards that divine love that opens its arms upon the Cross to take us . ' These were the words of an old man broken by sorrow and ill-health . But the experience of great art in the life of the ordinary man is also a glimpse of the divine beauty , little as he may realize or want to realize it ; for if the expression of beauty is the highest attainment of existence in the aesthetic and metaphysical categories , it is only because of God 's creation of the world as an act of love . He created it , and man , in freedom , love , and truth , and saw that it was good . Music , more than any other art , speaks of a harmonious world , that heaven for which we are homesick . It is the instinct for beauty which makes us consider the world and its pageants as a glimpse of , a correspondence with , Heaven . . . . It is at once by poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the soul divines what splendours shine behind the tomb ; and when an exquisite poem brings tears to the eyes , such tears are not the sign of an excess of joy , they are rather a witness to an irritated melancholy , an exigency of the nerves , a nature ended in the imperfect world which would possess immediately on this very earth , a paradise revealed .  | The quotation is from Baudelaire 's gloss on some words in Poe 's The Poetic Principle . And Stravinsky has said Music comes to reveal itself as a form of communion with our fellow men , and with the Supreme Being . ' I am led , for my coda , back to St. Augustine and De Musica . In his book on The Church and Music , Dr. Erik Routley writes , Music for him Augustine brings the truth down from heaven and those who regard music as a means of sending up thoughts from the human mind would do well to mark his words . '  | J. M. CAMERON Mr. James Cameron , who teaches Philosophy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a medium of communication for the artist and the critic of the arts . RECENT English philosophy has become more self-conscious about language than perhaps philosophy has ever been before . The technical and scholastic ' character of most contemporary writing has produced wild accusations that philosophers are guilty of a blameworthy trahison des clercs ; that they have abandoned consideration of the great questions of philosophy and have retreated into a Byzantine hair-splitting ; that they do not provide the guidance that a failing civilization needs . These accusations betray a radical misunderstanding of the role of philosophy , for they ask of philosophy what can be provided only by religion . It is true that , historically , philosophy and religion have often been so intimately connected that in any given case it was hard to separate the philosopher from the theologian and the believer . Further , many philosophical problems , especially those of a metaphysical character , have been given point and interest by the religious concerns of the philosophers . It may even be true , as Dr. Etienne Gilson has often argued , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of purely philosophical problems ; e.g. the concept of creation , it can be argued , enables us to solve metaphysical problems that are raised but not solved by Aristotle . However this may be , the complaints advanced about modern English philosophy are in general misconceived , and seem to be in part founded upon impatience with the professional and technical character of con-  | temporary work . This character philosophy shares with the whole of modern intellectual culture.I Philosophical reflection upon language is not a duty to be imposed upon those who wish to use language for critical or creative purposes . Poets , critics , not to speak of philologists and lexicographers , are commonly quite unsophisticated in philosophical matters , but this is no hindrance to them in their own fields . Of course , there is no reason why poets and critics should not also be philosophers , or philosophers poets and critics ; and no doubt philosophical poets and poetical philosophers would choose peculiar themes . But this might be just as true of soldiers or farm labourers or civil servants who took to writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the philosopher in relation to the use of language ? critical or creative or just ordinary ? by others ? How does his work differ from that of the lexicographer or the student of comparative linguistics ? Perhaps we ought to begin by asking what it is that makes a problem a philosophical one ; then go on to ask in what sense reflection upon language presents us with philosophical problems ; and lastly to ask in what way , if any , the work of the philosopher can give help or illumination to the creative or critical user of language . I shall say that a philosophical problem is a second-order problem . ( I do not say or wish to imply that all philosophical problems are of this sort ; merely that a great many are ; and that perhaps all the philosophical problems connected with language are . ) A first-order problem is , for example , a scientific or a technical problem . Such a problem is solved , where it is solved , by a combination of hypothesis and information . For example , an educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the course of the study of Latin are transferable to the study of military strategy . This question can not be answered by footnote1 This point is well put in John Holloway : The " New Philosophy of Language " in England ' ( The Hudson Review , Vol . IV , No. 3 , Autumn 1951 ) .  | reflection . We have to ask ourselves if we are using the right hypothesis : e.g. it is true that learning skills are acquired ? Or we may ask if we have enough information about those who go from the study of Latin to the study of military strategy . A first-order problem may be very puzzling ; and we may even be in doubt as to whether a particular first-order problem ? e.g. is the physical universe expanding ? ? is soluble by us ; but we always have a good notion of the kind of conditions that have to be satisfied if we are to be in a position to solve the problem . Indeed , the way in which we set out the elements of a first-order problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have to satisfy . In order to solve second-order problems we do not need to get any more information than we already have . I will take as my examples a set of cognate philosophical problems as old as philosophy itself , or very nearly : namely , problems concerning the concept of mind and kindred concepts . Have we minds as well as bodies ? Are there acts of will ' ? Is knowing ' an act or a disposition or an achievement or now one and now another ? And so on . Now , these are very peculiar questions . It is plain that we do not need any more information than we now have in order to answer these questions , nor is the difficulty one of finding the right hypothesis . It would be odd to say : I will proceed upon the hypothesis that I have ( not ) a mind as well as a body ; for the second-order , philosophical question is about what such a hypothesis would mean . We have more information of a physiological and psychological kind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions of the concept of mind are relevant to the answering of the philosophical questions in the same way as those of Wittgenstein and Professor Gilbert Ryle . That he may have believed the seat of thought was the heart does not deprive his philosophical remarks of their point . To show all this I take the following expressions : I will bear it in mind . ' He has a good mind . ' I have a thought at the back of my mind . ' He lacks the will to live . ' He is in pain . ' He fails to understand the first principles of trigonometry . ' These are all  | instances of the use of the concept of mind or kindred concepts ; and it would be false to say that if I were to use these expressions on suitable occasions I should not know what I was talking about and that you would not understand what I was talking about . These are the very paradigm cases of expressions ( making use of the concept of mind ) which are understandable . In one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to what I mean when I utter these sentences . In what circumstances , then , can a second-order problem arise about the concept of mind ? In the following circumstances . I may bring together the following pairs of sentences : He has a well-stored mind ' ; He has a well-stored cupboard ' or I will bear what you say in mind and use it at the next committee meeting ' ; I will keep the chocolate in the rucksack and only give it to the children when I see they 're getting tired . ' As we reflect upon these collocations of sentences , the second sentence of each pair continues to be clear , but the first gets more perplexing and even menacing . We try without success to assimilate the first sentence to the second ( never , I think , the second to the first ) ; and we have the idea that because we can not assimilate the first to the second , there is something wrong with the first . The meaning of the first seems to become obscure and doubtful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the expressions well-stored ' and in ' of the mind ? We seem not to know the meaning of sentences of which in the most obvious sense we very well know the meaning . Questions of this kind can not be settled by getting more psychological or other information . Information and hypothesis are only relevent to the answering of questions about the meaning of such sentences when the questions are put by one who does not know , or does not know well , the English language ; and then such questions would be as much first-order questions as questions about the meaning of the Minoan script . But if the questions about meaning are put by one who knows English well , then it is clear that meaning ' has here a strange , that is , philosophical sense ; and that we already have all the information we need to have in order to answer the questions .  | We may say that philosophical questions of this kind arise through our becoming perplexed about the use of our language This perplexity comes about through our seeing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different functions , as for example when we discover that sentences which mention minds do not rfcr in the same way as sentences which mention bodies , or parts of ' bodies such as brains . When we speak of ' minds as things , but strange things in that they are not visible , tangible , and so on , we may be , and sometimes we are , advancing a philosophical theory which springs out of the effort to assimilate sentences using the concept of mind to sentences using the concept of body . A ghostly referent seems , so to speak , to save the bacon of meaning . Once we see that philosophical questions , or at least a great many of them , have this strange character , we see why in one sense philosophy never gets anywhere ' . Extended reflection upon a philosophical problem is the solution , and the only one , of the problem . The path of reflection is long , circuitous , and hard ; and of necessity its returns to its starting-point : the puzzle , which is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place moved to the activity of reflection . This is why ancient writers on philosophy are not always out of date ' ; whereas ancient writers on the sciences are almost always out of date and studied , when they are studied , for purposes other than scientific . The point of the activity of the philosopher is to exhibit what in a confused way we already know . ( This is even true of such an exalted form of philosophical discourse as that which is concerned with the relations between God and the world . ) Such was the presupposition of the Socratic method and of the inquiries of the scholastic philosophers ( those of the Middle Ages , that is , not ? not uniformly , at least ? those of the period since Descartes ) . Of course , philosophers , especially the philosophers of the last three centuries , are not exempt from the temptation to megalomania ; and they have on occasion put about the view that the philosopher has a privileged access to REALITY . ( This view has been shared by philosophers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Idealists and the members of the Vienna Circle . ) They are professionally predisposed to certain aberrations . For example , they sometimes say in portentous tones that , e.g. Time is unreal ' or Material objects are families of sense-data ' in such a way as to imply that it is false to say that I ate my breakfast after I got up or that in untenanted rooms there are tables and chairs . Upon all this the best comment is that of Wittgenstein : ' Philosophers who have denied the existence of matter have not wished to deny that under my trousers I wear pants . ' It is easy to see in what way reflection upon particular expressions may give rise to philosophical problems . We have just seen how collections of expressions making use of the concept of mind may provoke philosophical wonder . But in what way is language , in the sense in which English , Swahili , and Serbo-Croat are specific forms of it , philosophically interesting ? No answer which is both general and profitable can perhaps be given to this question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that language provides the philosopher with his tools ; and that since he is concerned with questions of meaning , language is also in one sense his subject-matter ; for it is what we say that has meaning and is true or false . But the sense in which language is his subject-matter must be carefully distinguished from the sense in which language is the subject-matter of the lexicographer , the grammarian , the philologist , and the rest . The sense in which language is the subject-matter of ' the philosopher may be explained in the following way , though , as we shall see , there is something not quite right about this explanation . The philosopher is interested in determining the meaning and implications of our uses of such concepts as cause , mind , body , good , obligation , justice , et al . This is not the same as being interested in cause ' , mind ' , body ' , good ' , obligation ' , justice ' , et al . If it is said , for example , that every event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a cause ' presents the lexicographer with a set of constitutcnt parts each  | of which has a history and a role in the language , and these can be set out under the appropriate articles in a dictionary . The grammarian can show that the sentence is well-formed and can explain why this is so by reference to the received rules of English grammar . But when the philosopher discusses whether Every event must have a cause ' is analytic or synthetic he is raising questions which do not interest the other students of language as such ; for this question is not about Every event must have a cause ' as a sentence in the English language , but about what the sentence means , and what the sentence means can , more or less , be said in French or German or some other language . This is not quite satisfactory for various reasons . While language is certainly a lens through which we see the world , or a mirror which reflects it , each natural language is different from every other natural language ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use Dr. Waismann 's phrase . That current in modern philosophical analysis which flows from the work of G. E. Moore now admits that the analysis of any given expression can never be quite satisfactory in the sense of being quite complete . In technical jargon , the analysans is never substitutable for the analysandum . What the sentence means can only be said by the sentence ; and what it means it means within the language in which it is said and within the situation in which it is used . This has often been hidden from philosophers through their habit of taking single expressions and presupposing that they have a standard use . There is , of course , nothing vicious in this method provided its limitations are recognized , and such early models of analysis as A brother is a male sibling ' did no harm except in so far as they encouraged excessive expectations as to the scope of the method . While no expression taken as an analysandum can be given a wholly satisfactory analysans , it would be absurd to suppose that an expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give an extended description which at some point or other will enable the inquirer to catch on ' . In principle , this can be done both within languages and between languages . In so far as it is done between languages we are almost irresistibly im-  | pelled to suppose with the early Bertrand Russell that what a sentence and its translation have in common is a third entity , the proposition which both sentences express ; but there is reason to suppose , as I shall try to show , that this way of speaking presupposes a misleading model of language . How tempting it is to say that if two expressions share the same proposition , there could be a language , free from the untidiness and ambiguities of the natural languages , in which the proposition , which now lies hidden in the depths of the two expressions , could be expressed with perfect lucidity ? An old philosophical dream is that of a perfect language in which everything that is the case about the world could be said without ambiguity . Behind this dream there lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the indicative mood as the normal or standard uses of language , with other uses eccentric to this norm or standard . Such language is referential in a checkable sense . Other uses of language are either reducible by analysis to descriptive uses or are inherently trivial ( emotive , decorative , metaphysical in the pejorative sense , nonsense , and what have you ) . The influence of this model is to be seen in the way in which discussion of moral judgments ( e.g. x is good ' ) has staggered between the view that good ' is descriptive of a simple , unanalysable , non-natural quality and the view that it merely expresses feelings of approval . In the former case the model for x is good ' is x is yellow ' ; in the latter , it is held that x is good ' must be expressive of feelings if it can be shown , as of course it can , that x is yellow ' is not the right model for x is good ' ; for if it is not descriptive ? the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing left for it to do is to express ? or evoke ? feelings . ( The influence of this model is very plain in the distinction , drawn by C. K. Ogden and I. A. Richards , in such enormously influential works as The Meaning of Meaning and Principles of Literary Criticism , between referential ' and emotive ' uses of language . This crude distinction , and with it the misleading model of language presupposed , has largely been transcended  | by 1 . A. Richards in his later work ; but the initial crudity , because it is easily grasped and expressible in terms of slogans , continues to be influential , most deplorably , perhaps , in the teaching of English literature to children . ) The other model is that of a logical or mathematical calculus . It is more plausible to take this as the fundamental model ; for while it is pure prejudice to favour one mode of discourse against another , it is in fact true that in a very rough way much of our language does function as a calculus . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bertrand Russell and A. N. Whitehead . Berkeley , for example , remarked that it is not necessary ( even in the strictest reasonings ) significant names which stand for ideas shou 'd , every time they are us 'd , excite in the understanding the ideas they are made to stand for : in reading and discoursing names being for the most part used as letters are in algebra , in which tho a particular quantity be mark 'd by each letter , yet to proceed right it is not requisite that in every step each letter suggest to your thoughts , that particular quantity it was appointed to stand fora But even though it is true that language is often used as a calculus , it is plain that there are many uses of language which do not in the least conform to this particular model . This is especially plain in poetic uses of language , where what is said is not cashable ' in the way that the operations of a calculus must be . Every poetic utterance is what it is and not another utterance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , though not so plainly , of every expression in a natural language . The inadequacy of such models for the interpretation of language can perhaps most readily be seen if we examine the problem of metaphor . ( This problem is of special interest in connexion with the critical discussion of poetry and other forms of imaginative writing and consideration of it is thus peculiarly appropriate to the present occasion . ) There is a long tradition in philosophy which sees in the un- footnotet George Berkeley : Principles of Human Knowledge ( 171o ) , Introduction , para . 19.  | guarded use of metaphor one of the principal sources of philosophical error . Equally , there is a long tradition ? related to the philosophical tradition ? among writers on rhetoric and literary critics which sees metaphorical uses as merely optional and decorative . This tradition is enshrined in such canonized expressions as figure of speech ' , poetic licence ' , metaphorically speaking ' . It strengthens philosophical suspicion of metaphor , since it seems to imply that for a philosopher to make a metaphorical use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as more than expressions always reducible to expressions in the literal mode , is to forsake what is central in language for what is peripheral , appropriate in the higher flights of poetry and oratory , inappropriate in discourse about what is the case . It is simply false that metaphorical uses are peripheral in the natural languages . The natural languages are in substance so metaphorical that to prune a natural language of its metaphorical uses , dead , fading , living , and not yet born , would be to abolish it rather than mutilate it . This can be verified by examining pretty well any prose passage of more than two or three sentences . It is even plausible to say with I. A. Richards ( in his Philosophy of Rhetoric ? Lectures V and VI are especially relevant ) that metaphor is the constitutive form of language ' ; and there is some support for this from historical linguistics . That metaphor has a role in producing second-order problems of ' a philosophical kind is evident if we ask ourselves why sentences , such as those discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are puzzling . They are puzzling because as a matter of fact our language is such that some uses of the concept of mind are ineradicably metaphorical . In the mind ' , a deep mind ' , hidden motives ' ? there is no literal mode into which these expressions can be analysed without loss . We understand what is said through the metaphor ; and there are no alternative non-metaphorical expressions which will do the same job . What is true of ordinary discourse is just as true of the discourse of philosophers . The Wittgenstein of the Tractatus , for example , places a metaphor at the centre of his  | discourse . Of the framing of propositions he says : We make to ourselves pictures of facts . The picture presents the facts in logical space ' my italics . The same thing could be shown in connexion with other philosophical terminologies ( e.g. ' substance ' , impression ' , dialectic ' , etc . ) . All this is so clear that it seems plain that the power of the traditional models of language to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetoric in recent centuries ( Hobbes , Johnson , and George Campbell may be instanced ) flies in the face of the facts ; and the tradition is still influential . We may conjecture that one at least of the motives for a radical suspicion of metaphor is the dream of an ideal or logically perfect language freed of the ambiguities which infect all natural languages . In such a language every simple would have a name and no two simples would have the same name ; and this would suffice to rule out metaphor ; for whether or not there are simples to be named ( this is , after all , a metaphysical assumption ) , whatever can be named in a natural language can be named otherwise in the same language by that shift of meaning which occurs every time a new metaphorical usage is coined . It may be important to emphasize once again that this approach to the problem of metaphor is philosophical and not linguistic . Metaphorical uses are commonly understood without difficulty , even in the case of newly coined instances . A philosophical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an as yet unexplored symbolic system , nor is it an inquiry into a class of expressions eccentric to the canons of ordinary usage . We can in one sense be said not to understand what we do when we employ metaphor ; but this is the sense in which we may be said not to understand , if we are not philosophers , the distinction between , say , syntactical ' and semantic ' rules , though in another sense those who in the former sense do not understand this distinction may be said to understand the distinction perfectly since they are able , for example , to use correctly , and to make the correct inferences from , such expressions as the whole is greater than the part ' and John has red hair ' .  | Enough has now been said to show that the philosopher is not fitted to be a censor of anybody 's language , and that the notion of the philosopher as linguistic legislator ? one who tells us how to talk about cats and dogs , protons and electrons , right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooted in the confounding of first-order with second-order questions ; and in the ungrounded view that certain modes of discourse are standard , proper and central . If we make a question about the meaning of these expressions which use the concept of mind ( a second-order question ) into a question about whether there are or are not minds ( understood as a first-order question ) , we find ourselves in the absurd position of asserting that sentences the meaning of which everyone understands are without meaning and absurd . If we argue that descriptive expressions in the indicative mood are central or standard , then we become entangled in impossibly elaborated theories which either reduce expressions of other types ? commands , exhortations , value judgments , assertions of rules , and what have you ? to the required standard , or decree that expressions everyone makes use of and the function of which everyone understands are improper or meaningless . The first and chief gain , then , of philosophical reflection upon the problems of language is to show that the creative or critical writer is autonomous in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , no convincing philosophical arguments calculated to show that the philosopher has any title to instruct the poet , the novelist or the critic , or that these writers need an elaborate training in philosophy before they can talk sense in their own fields . Indeed , the greatest critics since the rise of the vernacular literatures in Europe are in no sense philosophers of any strict definition of the term . Johnson , Matthew Arnold , or Dr. Leavis and Mr. Lionel Trilling in our own period , are superb critics without ever feeling called upon to philosophize . Coleridge appears to be an exception , and he is perhaps the most remarkable of our philosophical critics ; but he is remarkable , not as one who sees clearly  | the connexions between critical and philosophical questions , but as one who combines in himself the two roles of philosopher ? reckless , disorderly and intuitive ? and of literary critic . I should not be taken as saying more than I am saying . Of course , in one sense criticism is a part of philosophy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of philosophy as the theory of politics or the theory of science ( not to be confused with scientific theories , e.g. the General Theory of Relativity ) . This is to say that the terminology of criticism , the arguments of critics , the implicit standards of critics , all of them generate a variety of philosophical problems ; and of course sensitive critics are very often aware of these problems , talk about them , take up positions in relation to them ; and do all this without being clear about the precise moment when they leap from critical questions of the first order to second-order questions about criticism . Such leaps occasionally provoke philosophers to humourless knucklerapping . This is sometimes in place ; but one has to remark that the good critic , precisely because of his insight into his own practice , may produce excellent philosophizing , no doubt open to technical criticism , but sharper and more original than the performances of philosophers in the same field . An impressive example of what I have in mind is Mr. Allen Tate 's brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kind of philosophical problem which is prompted by the practice of criticism is that of poetic truth ' . Such a problem is not to be bottomed in the closing paragraphs of this essay.2 But something may be said by way of showing that the philosopher may be of service to the literary critic ? perhaps even , though about this I am more doubtful , to such creative users of language as the poet and the novelist ? without usurping the proper function of the critic . Poems , novels , and plays are composed of statements and utterances of other kinds which seem to make the same sort of footnote1 In The Man of Letters in the Modern World ( New York , 19sO. 2 I have tried to say something on this question in my three articles on Words and Meaning in Poetry and Philosophy ' , The Downside Review , Spring and Summer 1952 , Summer 19s3 . I am not now very happy about much of what is said in those articles .  | claim to be judged as being true or false , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , as the utterances of historians , natural scientists , and witnesses on oath . This seems , prima facie , to be the case with Mr. Pickwick slept ' , There lived a wife at Usher 's Well ' , Ripeness is all ' , Gather ye rosebuds , while ye may ' . Indeed , Bentham said that all poetry was misrepresentation and for Hume poets are liars by profession who always endeavour to give an air of truth to their fictions ' . There seems to be something very odd about this view . Crudely , it is strange to say that Mr. Pickwick slept ' is false because to say that it is false seems to imply that it might have been true but was n't , like Napoleon won the battle of Waterloo ' . It seems safer to say that poems , novels , and plays are neither true nor false .

This is only to say where approximately literature should be placed in the chart of discourse in relation to history and science on the one hadd , painting and music on the other ; it is not to say that , for example , poetry is fundamentally ' or basically ' music or painting or anything else ; but to suggest that if we are worried about the paradoxes generated by supposing that poetic or fictional utterances are false because they seem to say what is not the case , we may lessen the worry by noting that this mode of discourse may in some respects , at least , have affinities with music and painting . About symphonies and pictures , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true or false in the way factual statements are true or false.l footnote1 On the whole question raised in this paragraph , see the brilliant paper by the late Margaret Macdonald , The Language of Fiction ' , in Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society : Supplementary volume XXVIII , 1954.  | So far , so good . But good critics do nevertheless use true ' and false ' of works of imaginative literature ; and it is not the business of the philosopher to tell him that he must n't talk like this . Here is Mr. D. G. James , for example : A play such as King Lear exhibits human life as it is known by its author ; our judgment on it is necessarily a judgment on its veracity , on its rendering of the features of things . It is not a matter of submitting the shows of things to the desires of the mind the reference is to The Advancement of Learning , 1I , iv , 2 ; it is a matter of seeing things as they really are ; and if things are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , whatever else it may be , is a bad play . ' Here , then , is a task for the philosopher . He can not , for reasons I have already given , say that whereas true ' is properly used of Napoleon was the husband of Josephine at a given time ' , it is improperly used by Mr. D. G. James of the complex of expressions which is the play King Lear . His task is , rather to explore the logical relations between these different uses in the hope that those who are seized by logical cramps when they read Mr. James on Lear ( just as Ave envisaged one who was seized by cramps when reflecting upon he has a well-stored mind ' ) maybe freed from them . This the philosopher will do , not to explain to Mr. James and his readers what Mr. James is really saying , what he must be saying if he means anything at all ? this would be fatuous and insolent ? but to enable us to give our undivided attention to what is said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field of symbolism . Poetic wholes ( such as King Lear ) are symbols or groups of symbols . The word symbol ' is here used in a sense analogous to , not identical with , the sense in which red ' , triangular ' , furtive ' and holy ' are symbols . The latter are symbols because , in accordance with certain rules , they can be used to characterize an indefinite number of things , real and imaginary . A complex of poetic symbols , such as King Lear , is not symbolic in the same sense , for it lacks the availability of verbal footnote I D. G. James : The Dream of Learning ( Clarendon press , 1951 ) , p. 79.  | symbols . It can no more be used to say something than can the Eroica Symphony or one of Mr. Henry Moore 's reclining figures . But it does say something , or a critic of Mr. James 's percipience would have no inclination to say what he does about it . Indeed , if anyone , philosopher or not , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : How true it is ! ' , this would be a ground for thinking that he was unacquainted with the play or was deaf to poetry as the tone-deaf are deaf to music . We can talk about and round King Lear ? this is what Mr. James is doing ? in the hope that in the end this talking about and round will enable us to listen to King Lear more faithfully . But what King Lear says is said only in and through King Lear .  | LANCE WRIGHT Mr. Lance Wright , Technical Editor of The Architectural Review and of The Architects ' Journal , presented this analysis of the visual arts as media . BEFORE we can say what is the effect of the visual arts upon us ? what they do for us , what they do to us ? something must be said about the general purpose of all art . What is art for ? This , will be answered very differently by different generations . Casting round for an answer , it seems to me that there are four main uses which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first and primary use is a very simple one : namely , to arouse and exercise the faculty to which each corresponds . It is , I think , this use which people have chiefly in mind when they speak of art for art 's sake ' . It is a use of great importance and dignity since , of course , the awakened faculties are ordinary means whereby we see God . The next use is to make comprehensible the external world . Seen in this way , art is a function which we all use all of the time , though when left to ourselves we may use it very ineffectively ; the mind is perpetually groping with the external world and art shows it how . Art gathers phenomena for us , puts them together in a way we can understand , signposts reality . The third use is very similar to this and perhaps hardly distinguishable from it : it is to bring a physical human order into as much of the external world as is susceptible to it . This is a global function of art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom realize in themselves . It is this function which we have in mind when we think of the sum of a whole mass of diverse but related works of art and speak of culture ' : for together they have made their time  | and their part of the world different from what it would otherwise have been . Lastly there is the most modest of all uses and the most common : simply to make an object , a salt-cellar or a carol or a detective story . It is possible to see all four of these uses ' in any work of art in any medium , though in many one or other use will be so vestigial as to be not worth noticing : all are capable of awakening in someone the faculty to which they appeal ( though they may not awaken yours or mine ) , all can serve as a signpost , all contribute to an order , all are ( or have been ) useful objects . WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF VISUAL ART ? When we apply these criteria to the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two difficulties . The first is that of deciding which are the visual arts ? The Classical tradition confined the term effectively to architecture , painting , and sculpture , though this same tradition went on to distinguish between these three major ' arts and an undefined number of minor ' or decorative ' arts . This latter definition corresponded to the age-old distinction between the liberal ' and the useful ' ( or mechanical ' ) arts , a distinction which has so close an analogy with that other distinction between sacred ' and profane ' . This is a more irfiportant matter than it looks because the tendency of the present age to blur , if not formally to reject , both of these distinctions is an exceedingly important phenomenon which in the long run is going to make a profound difference to our artistic as to our devotional ideas . This blurring or rejection is due not to any inability to distinguish between the motives which have given rise to these ideas , but to our practical realization that in life itself the two categories are commonly mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this as the incarnational idea ' , meaning thereby that common everyday acts are transformable by the will of him who makes them to play the part of Christ and that in the end religious ideas are normally best conveyed by acts which also have a temporal end in view . Something analogous to this has  | taken place with our notions of art and utility . We recognize that art is an end in itself which owes nothing to utilitarianism , but we go on to point out that art can inhere ( if that is the right word ) in any object made by man and that as all such objects are useful in some way or other it is generally a meaningless task to sort out objects in which the will to art ' was greater than the will to usefulness ' . This is not to say , of course , that all man-made objects are works of art , but only that they are capable of being such ; also , though we speak of the will to art ' it is not suggested that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , for in the end important works are made only by those who possess a certain , comparatively rare charism . This notion of the interdependence of art and utility and the consequent fallacy of the academic delimitation of art has been brought home to us by a great number of facts of experience ; and as these bear directly on the way works of art affect us , it seems worth citing some of them here . Perhaps the most startling case and the one which has most caused people to think , is the celebrated division which has occurred between architecture and engineering . Almost imperceptible at first , in its beginnings at the end of the eighteenth century , the open nature and hence the scandal of this division has grown with the advance of applied science . For architecture , being a pure ' art and therefore governed by unchanging principles , has tended to be static and to enforce its other worldly ' quality with a long series of period revivals ; while engineering , being pure utility , has made it a point to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practitioners could digest . The curious separation between sensibility and entrepreneural skill to which this gave rise was aided by the formation of the separate profession of engineer ; if you were artistic you became an architect , if you were good at mathematics you became an engineer . From the point of view of the man in the street , the architect was the chief loser by this , becoming first a sort of social luxury , to be used only when money was no object , and latterly ? when money is always an object ? something akin to an incubus ; but now a number of facts  | have come to light which show that this kind of evaluation has little meaning and that engineering has been equally impoverished by the absence of the kind of ability which the architect has to bring . The moral of this seems to be that great structural artefacts are capable of making the same order of imprint on the mind of the observer as buildings which have been designed particularly with the object of making such an imprint . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of Town Planning . Here it is recognized that the work of art ' is not the isolated building but the environment in which it stands . There is always some doubt about what environment is , how far it extends . Those who manipulate these things say that environment is a visual thing and extends as far as the eye can see : it is , in other words , a personification of the genius loci . It is an important admission that places affect us in the same way as formal works of art ; and in fact the changes in our ideas about environment which have taken place in the short forty years or so that we have been giving the matter thought are in themselves evidence of our persistent broadening of what we mean by art ' . At first the only environments worth worrying about were those which possessed an unbroken screen of ' buildings which were both old and possessed a good architectural quality : they were the places where people went in charabancs to gowp . In those days the only permissible way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build it in the same architectural style as the remainder . This concept has been progressively broadened in two ways . On the one hand the number of types of environment which are approved has been continually extended until it is now conceded that every locus has a genius of some sort which requires fostering ; and on the other the doctrine of how to intrude new elements has been liberalized . The most recent expression of the theory is the issue of the Architectural Review entitled Outrage . Counter attack ' ( December 1956 ) . In this , all environments are classified under five heads and a grammar of visual effects appropriate to each is proposed . We are not here concerned with the inherent weakness of this theory so much as with its recognition  | that all things seen are capable of producing an effect on the observer and that this effect matters . Passing to figurative art , we find a similar revaluation caused , this time , by the growing importance of all forms of reproduction . Gone are the days when works of art are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one place . There are two manifestations of this change : there is the use of methods of reproduction ? mostly photographic ? to publicize original works of art ( we think particularly of the use of photography to illuminate sculpture and to show it in new and unexpected lights ) ; and there is also the growing importance of work which is actually designed for reproduction , and where the finished work is therefore not the artist 's drawing but each copy of the published work . There is little doubt that the techniques of reproduction have great influence on the way in which we regard visual art and on the effect it has upon us : they are becoming an integral part of our artistic dispensation to the extent that works which have been through the mill of reproduction tend to have a greater impact upon us than those which have not . How many pictures in our galleries are more effective as coloured postcards than as originals ! The dignity and importance of this event has to some extent been masked by the fact that the poster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has tended to be used mostly by those whose visual sense is undeveloped . Nevertheless the cult of the good poster is evidence that a humble ( or even suspect ) motivation ? i.e. to persuade someone to buy something ? may still give rise to an authentic work of art . THE LITERARY USURPATION I have been concerned up to now to show how the scope of what we mean by visual art has been widened far beyond the traditional categories , so that we are rapidly approaching a situation in which it will be generally accepted that since all things which are seen are capable of affecting man , all are potential media for art . The second complication which has to be faced before we can give any account of what the visual arts do to us  | arises from our own educational background and may be described as the literary usurpation ' . Our civilization is incurably literary : the printed word is our instinctive means of ' conveying all but the simplest ideas . Even a Member of Parliament , as Mr. Evelyn Waugh has pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make or read a symbol ? In England this literary bias is even more developed than in other countries , to the extent that even urgent signs like Keep left ' or Major Road Ahead ' are written out because authority dare not rely on the simple visual symbol even though this , when understood , would register more rapidly . In fact the visual faculty has been partially atrophied through disuse . This is in itself unfortunate , but what concerns us here is that we tend to see works of art through literary glasses : in other words we do n't sec them at all ? we read literary associations into them . The strongest evidence for this can be found in the response of ordinary people to architecture . When they are confronted by a building they are not impressed by whether it is a good shape , has a good colour , is a good symbol of what goes on inside it . Instead they cast round to think what it reminds them of : if this memory is a gracious one ? as an historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure in it , if the memory is disagreeable ( it reminds me of a factory ' ) they will dislike it : their reaction will always be at one remove from the thing they are actually seeing . The great majority therefore are immunized against visual art : they do n't see it at all and their reaction to it is not a visual reaction . For this reason we are probably justified in disregarding the characteristic response of ' today 's people to works of visual art and in passing on to the question of what that response ought to be ? to the inherent nature of visual communication . ART AS A VISUAL THERAPY The best way of doing this seems to be to revert to the four purposes of art at the beginning of this paper and to set down in what sense the group of visual arts fulfils them . The first of these is simply to exercise the faculty to which they correspond , here the faculty of sight . Art is a sort of therapy for  | the human person . The eyes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in so many cases , as we have seen , it does n't because the soul has not looked through the window for so long , but has sat indoors instead looking-in to the television set provided by literature . It would be interesting to know how much people do in fact see ' : how much of the reality ' which flashes past in fact strikes home . It seems that there is a sort of law of familiarity ' with this kind of ' seeing : in general we do n't see ' anything at all unless it is pointed out to us in the first place or unless we are in a particularly receptive mood when it flashes into view : that thereafter our perception of it becomes more acute each time we see it ? but only up to a certain point : beyond that point the object becomes familiar and gradually fades before our real vision . Curiously enough this fading is often accompanied by a certain distaste , so that we are surprised and rather impatient when someone else sees this same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is something which happens very noticeably in architectural fashions : nothing is more intensely annoying to the few who follow ' architecture than to hear of the delight which others express for architectural habits which to them are stale . On this question of visual impressions it is interesting to notice the extraordinary transformation wrought by repainting a building or by redecorating a room . This is caused not by the mere consideration that what before was dirty is now clean but by the fact that the changed reflectance of the surface compels you to see ' the old forms afresh . It seems probable that the desire to make people see plays a more important part in the present development of the visual arts than we think . One of ' the formal purposes of abstract art was , of course , to give the onlooker no chance to search round for associations and thence to appreciate forms and colours for their own sakes ; but apart from this it seems probable that a certain coarsening of effects which can be noticed over the whole field of contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to re-establish conmiunication with people , to ensure that a work is seen than to ensure that it is lastingly acceptable .  | Again architecture has embarked on the difficult venture of making people see space differently ' , removing as far as possible the sense of enclosure and emphasizing instead the space continuum . A wall is no longer an element enclosing a compartment , it is a plane set up in space . This experiment aims at producing a profound psychological change in man by visual means , by little more than a sustained visual trick : for man will in fact be enclosed as before . VISUAL ART AS INTERPRETATION This same example might be used to illustrate the second purpose of visual art , namely to make comprehensible the external world ' , though it is more commonly described as offering a new interpretation of the external world . You may think that you are fenced off from the external world , that you have built for yourself a little haven , a lasting abode : but in fact you have clone none of these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are conditioned by both of these ; is it not better that the places you live and wqrk in should express this truth ? ' This is not intended as a quotation but as the sort of argument which this architectural ideology poses . In time ' as well as in space ' because it is also concerned to point the moral of the ephemeral nature of all human building . Though some buildings may prove even more ephemeral than their architects intended , it is very significant that ? perhaps for the first time since the beginning of history ? the time-dimension enters into our calculations . Particularly is this true in big cities where it is formally recognized that change is inherent in life , that buildings should be designed to last a certain span of years and the cost of their demolition and rebuilding at the end of it covered by a sinking fund . Once more I am not concerned to say whether this is right or wrong but only to point out the link between visual forms on the one hand and fundamental human arrangements on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , in our civilization at least , is more properly one of the purposes of painting than of architecture . In a sense this is no more than a  | by-product of the figurative artist 's constant effort to make people see . He wanders round the world seeing what is there and what of human value is to be found . Once more it is an important purpose , for it teaches people to take as much pleasure as they can from what they have got . This purpose has been particularly noticeable during the last three or four generations or so when more and more of the visual scene has been rendered unfamiliar ( and usually horrific ) by unconsidered technology . Here the figurative artist has followed in the wake of devastation , recording its effects ( its dumps , its dreary wastes , its slums ) and picking out the elements ( machine forms , for instance ) from which a new order of symbols may be built . It is the first of these two services which comes most properly under this head . Generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are slowly taught to accept such things as viaducts and dockyard cranes ; and gradually through the effort of figurative artists , to see and accept more and more . It is a curious fact that what is strange and new in life has no meaning , no resonance until painters ( and indeed writers ) have drawn a meaning out of it . Theirs is a sort of digestive function , making new and unfamiliar things a part of ourselves . The figurative artist acting as interpreter sees what is , and makes the best of it . VISUAL ART AS A PRINCIPLE OF ORDER Once more it is difficult to see the dividing line between this function of interpretation and the next function , that of reform : or as we put it earlier bringing a physical human order into as much of the external world as is susceptible to it ' . Yet it is an essentially different function and the most important of all . It is indeed this creative , prophetic function which people mostly have in mind when they think of the artist as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes him a social oddity , a man apart . The trouble is that this charism is exceedingly rare , the possession of it is not at all easy to detect , either by the possessor himself or by other people , and that all who make their living by one or other of the arts are obliged to lay claim to it . The possi-  | bility that he has this charism gives the artist an absolute right to carry on his work unmolested by the laity . That is why it is at best exceedingly inadvisable for those who have commissioned a painter or a sculptor to make a nuisance of themselves by demanding adjustments to what he has done . It is a curious fact that this prophetic quality seems to inhere in the group of visual arts in a more positive and definite manner than in any of the others and that it is able to operate in a society which as a whole has no appreciation whatever of visual things . Few facts of recent cultural development are more impressive than the way in which ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago by men like Mondrian and Picasso and unleashed by them have been persistently working in the world and have been used to solve technical problems which themselves are unrelated to figurative art . In this matter of prophecy there seems to be a clear line of development : for it begins in figurative art , passing from there to architecture and passing from architecture to town planning . Thus it is that those of us who are now about half-way through our lives may live to see the idea of simultaneous vision ( which was proposed by the cubists round about the time of the first World War ) being used to solve the complex spatial problems which we must soon face in our city centres . It is this sort of prophecy which we have in mind when we say that the broad effect of visual art is humanization . Man without visual art invents , creates , changes ; but the outward effect of all this effort lacks humanity . This is a truth which we are particularly aware of at the present time . We agree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they ' work ' : developments in transport , the industrialization of building , etc. , etc . We are glad of them and do not want the clock turned back ; but we are also agreed that they are mostly ugly and incoherent , that they do not in the aggregate give us the kind of pleasure that we get from the finished works of past periods , even though we recognize that they are ours ' and the works of the past are not . This is because of the visual artist 's absence from the milieux where these great developments were  | taking place . It seems strange to keep reverting to the analogy with religion , but it seems that the sense in which the artist 's presence ' in this world is necessary is very similar to that in which the Christian 's presence is necessary . One is concerned with persons , societies , and institutions and the other is concerned with signs , things , and places . Both work through other people and require intimate association with them , both generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a certain mystery about the propagation of visual ideas which is analogous to the mystery of the propagation of faith : both work a direct and indefinable illumination ' . The fourth and last purpose of art and therefore the fourth and last criterion of the manner in which works of art strike us , is that of making an object . I described this as the most modest of all uses and the most common ; but it is evident that there is no scale of values in these purposes . The old phrase the arts of man ' was made to include precisely this making of things for use ? for common use as well as for representational use ? and it seems that we are getting hack to this primary meaning . We are coming to realize once more that a thing made and which you can see is in fact a symbol , a very complex symbol of the purpose which it serves , of the materials of which it is made and indeed of the outlook of those who shared in its making and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptionally sensitive and well-informed people the sight of a common object calls a whole civilization to memory . When things were relatively few and hard and expensive to make , their symbolic value seems to have been more easily recognized : at least we have the impression that people cared more about them and were more successful in endowing them with the mark of their human origin . With the beginnings of mass production , things ' lost this kind of respect and there followed what is often referred to as the devaluation of the symbol ' ? a devaluation which did not only affect small and common objects . Symbols are devalued when things are no longer prized , but they are also devalued when people no longer reflect upon them . It is necessary for the onlooker to reflect before things seen can corn-  | municate their symbolism . It may well be , therefore , that while we have been so ready to attribute devaluation to the lack of hand craftsmanship , another and more decisive cause has been our own loss of the power of reflection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and common objects because it is the particular success of the last generation to rediscover the dignity of small and common objects . But the branch of art which is traditionally concerned with this idea of the work of art as a thing or an object is sculpture . For a piece of sculpture , one might almost say , is a thing of the highest order , it is a presence ' which enforces reflection on all but the most distrait , and it is no accident that it has come down to us as the medium best suited for making an image of God . CONCLUSION If these , then , are the uses ' of art , there is still something to be said about the place of art in everyday life ; and there is a moral to be drawn from a comparison between what that place should be and what it actually is . When we come to consider the place which visual art actually holds , we are aware of three different facts of experience which seem to tell against each other . First we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of everyday life is concerned , visual art is virtually written off : people give the impression that they get on very well without it . We hear for instance that odd and interesting phrase ? on a bus perhaps ? in which someone is described as being ever so artistic ' ( as he or she might just as well be described as ever so religious ' ) . Though we are usually left in doubt about whether this description is intended to be approving or not , we are left in no doubt that it is something which the speaker does not consider as applying equally to herself . It is a distinguishing mark , something which you need not be . The next fact of experience is that in those comparatively remote quarters where visual art is esteemed , it appears to be esteemed chiefly for the wrong reasons . There are , of ' course , an  | infinite number of wrong reasons for thinking highly of the visual arts , and each generation has its own . The most common is to think of it not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in terms of its products , which they see as a necessary part of ' culture . To these people , culture ' is something which has a value of its own ; it is an immense superstructure which must at all cost be maintained . Such people become easily worried about the future of European Culture ' and when some particular art seems likely to die out , they will go to extreme lengths to preserve it , even to the length of practising it themselves . The third fact of experience tells us that visual art represents an activity which is basic to man and which keeps cropping up in unexpected places . This is the age of what I would call ' unregistered ' art : of the dispersion of this symbol-making activity into all sorts of fields where no one up to now has thought of looking for it . I am thinking particularly of ephemeral printing , of the design of mass-produced components , of humble back-yard hobbies . Nevertheless , this sporadic evidence of ' visual art in unexpected quarters must not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , for the overwhelming majority , the twin faculty of symbol-making and symbol-recognizing is nine-tenths atrophied ? as is also true of ' the faculty for believing . The natural outcome of these two long-standing defects is that life is not valued as it should be , and that the privilege of mere being is not valued in the least . There is little or no reflection : life is a routine , the world a place we have stumbled into by accident . This deplorable insouciance is the aspect of modern society which concerns us most and which it is the particular function of ' visual art to dispel . It is the antithesis ? to quote deliberately a non-European example ? of that extraordinary awareness of the miraculous nature of life which we see in the classical civilization of Japan . Clearly this restoration of the faculty of visual art demands a certain programme , a missionary effort . It is beyond the scope of this paper to outline such a programme , but a few points can be made .  | The first point is that visual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparation in the subject : its truths are not universally self-evident . This is a fact of which we have become painfully aware recently , when the language of art has been changing so rapidly . But apart from this there is a simple law which lays down that the more you know about a thing the more it means to you and the greater its effect upon you . In order to appreciate the complexity of a work of art you have to be able to differentiate the parts . There is , in a sense , almost as much effort required in reading a symbol as there is in making one : for the two activities are complementary . There is thus a great effort to be made by everyone if we are to create a society and an environment in which symbols can live and be recognized and vivify all who share them . How are people to be persuaded to make this effort ? Up to now it seems that we have been merely making an appeal to the prestige of visual art , have held it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight in . We wonder if this is the right approach . Considering the other atrophied human faculty , that of belief , it has been our experience that the best way to bring about authentic revival is to get people to ask the fundamental questions : What am I ? ' Why was I made ? ' Where am I going ? ' The point arises whether there might not be some analogous way of restoring the atrophied faculty of sight . It was with this end in view that I tried to set down at the beginning of this paper what were the purposes of Art . It is a matter ? is it not ? ? of seeing the human person anchored in time and place and dependent on visual art for primary help and support . We need it to egg us on to see ; we need it to help us to understand what is going on about us , to pin visible tickets on to facts ; we need it to show us how to reorganize our physical surroundings so that they are a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Architecture ; and we need it to show us how to make things , smallish things , which we want and which will symbolize for us the magic which inheres in the humblest artefacts serving human life .  | ARNOLD HASKELL Mr. Haskell , the director of the Royal Ballet ( Sadlers Wells ) School , has had a lifetime of experience of ballet . He writes here of dancing as a spectator . THE dance is so vast a subject ? in some of its aspects it embraces a social history of mankind ? that I must make clear from the start what are to be the narrow confines of this talk . I am on the other side of the footlights from Mary Drage and my point of view throughout is that of the trained watcher . She tells us what dancing can mean to the performer while I will try to set out what the watching of dancing has given to one particular spectator . I am concerned with dancing and not with the composite art of ballet of which dancing forms a part . I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactions , not only because they happen to interest me intensely , and they do , but mainly because I can see no other way of dealing with the subject . During the past forty years or so I have watched hundreds of dancers all over the world in hundreds of performances , I have met and discussed their art with them and during the past ten years I have been intimately concerned in their creation . Inevitably I have come to certain conclusions . Paradoxically it is more modest by far to talk in personal terms than to lay down the law about dancers in general . Moreover , there is in the criticism of dancing a wider diversity of opinion than with any other art . There is no script , no score , and no illustration through which one can refresh the memory . So much of one 's point of view therefore depends upon the exact period at which one started watching and what opportunities one has had .  | It is quite certain that anyone familiar with Pavlova , Karsavina , and Ulanova will judge not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have not been so fortunate , just as one 's views on the art of ballet in general will have been coloured by the golden years of Diaghileff . It is quite impossible therefore to be objective , and dishonest to maintain the pretence . I must , however , start with certain basic ideas about the dance in general . I can best begin with the charmingly revealing parable that Degas was fond of quoting . After the Muses have had a busy day , each as the inspirer of her particular art , they refresh themselves by joining Terpsichore in the dance . Dancing , expression in rhythmic movement , is something that is a basic part of everyone 's make-up , though , like so many other things , this is hnrgely obscured in the civilized city-dwelling man ( perhaps after all not so disguised when one thinks of rock ' n ' roll ' and the Palais on a Saturday night ! ) . Animals have elaborate courtship dances and man danced long before he had coherent speech . The origin of music doubtless lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rhythmic chant in some jungle clearing . The very first dance was used for some magic purpose connected with fertility or the hunt , and the body was also used for acts of worship . The Dance was developed among men under the direct guidance of the gods ' , wrote Plato . Much of the rich Hindu ( lance consists of ( lanced hymns that are deeply moving when performed by artists of such integrity as Shanta Rao ) . Their sacred nature is unmistakable . For the first time I understood the religious nature of the Song of Solomon when watching Shanta Rao . This oriental dancer could make one feel the expression of religious emotion in sensual symbols in a way that no reasoned commentary could achieve . Shanta Rao using the oldest surviving dance technique gave me a major dance experience . In Christianity what exquisite beauty lies in the movement of the mass , which Ronald Knox has compared to a ballet , and a true danced performance still survives at Easter at Seville where boys dance and play their castanets in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date people began to dance for social purposes , for their own recreation and enjoyment . Such dances could be simple capers round a maypole or elaborate performances at court that took time , money , and the skill of the greatest artists of the day to produce . Such performances were essentially a product of the High Renaissance and it is from them that the Western European dance form of ballet was born . With the Renaissance and the birth of ballet the dance became divorced from religion or from the expression of anything mystic , but the exercises and rigid discipline required maintain a close link with religious training ? this is of course unsuspected by most dancers though some of my Catholic and oriental pupils have shown their awareness of it ? and of all artists the dancer is the most subjected to a continuous discipline and to the maintenance of an attitude of humility throughout her career . Even when at the top of the tree she takes a daily lesson , she is always the pupil , corrected and criticized , and can avoid none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of movement . It is , I am sure , this intense discipline that makes possible those rare performances which are the culminating achievement of the dance and that shows that the once strong link between mysticism and dancing is not entirely severed . The attitude of humility that I have mentioned is an indispensable attribute of the great dancer . It is not modesty ; the dancer may be well aware that she is ahead of her nearest rival and may express this awareness in no uncertain manner , but she is humble about her own gift . She never talks of it as if it were something that she had created . She regards herself rather as the guardian of something that is bigger than herself . I have noticed this attitude particularly in many talks with the Russian dancers Pavlova , Karsavina , and Ulanova . I think that it is implicit in their dancing . It is a commonplace for Russians to talk of doucha ( soul ) in an artist where with us it would sound affected . Just a few words about this arduous technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sentimental who imagine that the highest form of dancing is an improvised skipping around  | in flowing draperies , a view they borrowed from a misunderstanding of Isadora Duncan , an artist who completely misunderstood her own great gifts . Ballet technique is nothing more nor less than the grammar of language . It has grown up all over Europe just as language did , steps ( words ) being gathered in from village green , fairground , and court ballroom . It has travelled extensively , enriching its vocabulary in Italy , France and Russia , and recently in Britain and the United States . This is not therefore something created artificially like Esperanto or Volapuk and incapable of producing a literature . It is a perfect system of physical training , and when it has been assimilated by the dancer and is completely at his command he can use it to express anything that can be expressed through his body . It is also , as I have come to realize more and more through experience , of the very greatest value in general education . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have completely misunderstood the nature of ballet technique . They have invented an esperanto-movement of their own in order to express certain ideas ; incidentally ideas usually totally unsuited to movement but which they say can only be expressed through this new technique . They forget that Picasso learnt painting in the orthodox manner and not through some freshly evolved ad hoc technique . They are also inclined to assert that the discipline of ballet is so rigorous that it kills personality . That too is nonsense . Personality may be rare but it is certainly not something that is delicate , and it can only be developed to the full when it makes use of a disciplined technique . The free-lance or modern ' dancer may have something to express ; she may in fact have a positive contribution to make to choreography , but she will never have the full means of self expression because she will never have truly conquered her body . I can think of nothing more earth-bound than the modern dancers ' of the U.S.A. or of Germany in the 192os . This dance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes a burden . I believe that this modern dance ' , still so popular in some educational circles , because it can be taught by the gym mistress , is as definitely harmful to the pupil as it is  | unpleasant to the spectator ; and that is putting it strongly ! Even Isadora Duncan , an exception to so many of the rules , came to her full development in the person of the ballet dancer Galina Ulanova , I in so many ways the spiritual child of Pavlova and Duncan . I hope these generalizations will have cleared the way for the main theme of my talk : the pleasure and the experience that I personally have gained through watching dancing for over forty years . At the very lowest level an audience gains pleasure , which it shows through noisy and instantaneous applause , from the performance of an obviously difficult feat . An example of this is the notorious thirty-two fouetter in the ballroom act of Swan Lake . The dance of which this is a part is often put into a programme alone and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to inspire the reaction , Is n't it difficult , is n't she clever . I could never do that . ' Here dancing and acrobatics overlap ; there are , after all , musical acrobats and unmusical dancers ! At quite another level the performer can match the brilliance of the steps with the brilliance of her presentation . The effect is to show that such dazzling technical feats are natural and easy to a person of dazzling personality . The audience does not feel any anxiety ; on the contrary , it identifies itself with the performer and is uplifted , we are experiencing this with her ' . A superb example of this is the shining and glowing Fonteyn in the famous Rose Adagio from The Sleeping Beauty . Taken out of context and done as a separate item it is a stunt , but as a part of ' the development of the little Princess Aurora coming after her charmingly gay entrance and before the finger pricking episode it is truly romantic . Its difficulties , though obvious to the specialist , are of secondary importance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aurora . At yet another level there is the immense pleasure to be gained from the sheer beauty of line , both static and in motion . Take the arabesque for instance . Here the eye travels slowly down the line of the back and then , in contrast to this gentle slope , there is the triangle formed by the legs . It is in a sense a physical footnote1 See Plate 2I.  | pleasure akin to the feeling of a statue with the fingers ; an important element of appreciation in sculpture . When the dancer is in motion very much the same thing applies . We rely on our memory of a whole sequence of movements . We ask ourselves how harmonious is the single dancer , transformed by our kino-aesthetic memory into a frieze ? To put it more clearly : imagine all the movements of a solo dance exposed on a single long strip of photographic plate ; is the composition formed a harmonious one ? Hitherto I have talked as if this were purely a question of sculpture , but remember that the movement is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time enchanted by harmony of composition and by the fact that , because of the dancer 's feeling for musical line and phrasing , we are actually watching music . A supreme example of this is the prelude from Les Sylphides . Here is a magnificent composition that not only follows the musical line but that interprets the spirit of the music . Fokine believed it to be a supreme test of musical-dramatic interpretation . I have seen very few really moving performances of this dance ; to be adequate is to fail . At yet another level is the pleasure to be gained from the dramatic interpretation of a role ; and to this are added the pleasure in composition and in musical interpretation already mentioned . The important thing is that the body must be able to express to perfection something that can not be expressed in words . Movement is in no sense a substitute for words . I can best give an example or two of such unforgettable moments of complete poetic expression in ballet . The first was Karsavina in Le Spectre de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virginal Je suis le spectre de la rose que to portais hier au ha " A young girl has just returned from her first ball . We see her standing in the beam of moonlight that floods through the french  | window of her bedroom . She is looking at a rose that has been given her at the ball . She sinks down into a chair and dreams . The spirit of the rose ( Nijinsky ) floats through the window and dances with her . In her dreams she lives through all the excitement of the dance . And then once again she is sitting in her chair ; the spirit of the rose has leapt through the window ; and what a sensational leap it was , one of the legends of ballet . It was not , however , the most memorable part of the ballet ; that , for me , was the awakening of Karsavina . In those few moments , moments with no dancing in them at all , you had the moving picture of adolescence with all its pathos , its problems and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and awoken a woman . Another unforgettable moment , very similar in theme , was that given by Ulanova in Romeo and Juliet . It is the moment when she suddenly sees in the mirror that she is growing into a woman and is half pleased and half frightened . It is interesting to note that here is an episode that Shakespeare has not recorded , though the ballet interprets the text very closely . This dancer , no longer young , transformed herself completely into the child-woman Juliet ; but more of Ulanova later . To fulfil itself in this way the dance requires simple music and technically simple movement . On the whole , modern choreography , outside Russia , gives very little opportunity to the dancer to provide such moments of poetic truth . The choreographer tends to exploit his own personality through the use of difficult steps and acrobatic lifts and the accent is on a technique that can not be hidden . This may make for excellent ballet , but here I am not talking of ballet as a whole but of dancing and the impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that for my taste the great ballet is the one that affords the dancer the greatest opportunities of developing her personality and her stature as a medium for poetry . More and more I have come to prefer watching the ballet that is already so familiar that nothing distracts me from the dancing . I am beginning to find the clever ' choreographers a bore . Were I to relive moments spent in the theatre , I would , I believe , choose to see Pavlova in The Dying  | Swan rather than many of the brilliant ballets that Diaghileff produced in collaboration with the greatest artists of the day . In The Dying Swan , using a simple pas de bourree within the reach of thousands if considered purely as a technical feat , she created in the space of two or three minutes a tremendous tragedy of life and death.l It is a commonplace to comment on the ephemeral nature of ballet . I can not , however , over a quarter of a century after , hear that music of Saint Saens without seeing every movement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of ghosts that will dance as long as anyone remains alive who saw her . Dancing can on rare occasions rise to a still higher level than the perfect line , plus perfect musical phrasing , plus the interpretation of a character and the conveying of an atmosphere . It can rise to such heights that one is compelled to use the language of mysticism , for nothing in the theatre vocabulary will describe what has taken place . The dancer expresses a universal truth , watching her is an experience of which we are conscious but that we can not put into words . To me the supreme example of this has been the Russian ballerina Galina Ulanova . Until I saw her I had no conception to what heights the dance ( or for that matter the theatre ) could rise . I am well aware that 1 can not express this emotion in words . It is possible of course to write a reasoned appreciation of her interpretation of Giselle , to say why I considered it by far the best of the many Giselles I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful touches that made her Juliet so remarkable an achievement . I have done so at length , elsewhere . It is the something extra added to the Ulanova-Giselle and Ulanova-Juliet that defies reasoned analysis . Ulanova 's concentration on the character she is portraying is so intense that her identification with the character is complete . She deliberately surrenders the ballerina-personality ' always present even in the best Giselles . She rises above the banality of Gautier 's story and Adam 's music to confront us with the soul of a woman who loves . In this footnote1 Ulanova used the same choreography to convey an entirely different emotion ; not one of pathos but of the triumph of humanity over death .  | surrender of personality we come once again to the humility I have already stressed . It comes from the surrender known to mystics in art and religion . Aesthetic experience is the twin brother of mystic experience . ' The Indian writer on aesthetics , the late Ananda Coomaraswamy , in his fine collection of essays The Dance of Shiva , has many illuminating things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grace that can not be achieved by deliberate effort ' . By this he does not , of course , mean that no effort is required in attaining craftsmanship . In other words the artist aims at perfection of craftsmanship but the resultant work of art is independent of the will . Ulanova 's curtain-call confirmed the full extent of her surrender . It was an awkward almost gawky bob with none of the customary dignity of the prima ballerina who is graciously pleased to acknowledge the plaudits of her audience . She had been recalled from afar and was not quite sure whether the noisy intrusion was really welcome . It is interesting to note , when dealing with an artist of genius such as this , how completely unanimous was opinion at every level ; from the hardened balletomane to the theatregoer who had started out rather shocked at the idea of a dancing Juliet , from the stage hand ( always a level-headed critic ) to the painter and the writer . And it was quite astonishing how many mentioned the words a religious experience ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her aim was to move people and make them feel better ' . In any other dancer this might have sounded a pose , to her it came perfectly naturally . She had broken the barrier of technique and come out on the other side . To me Ulanova is not only incomparably the greatest dancer I have ever seen : she is the Dance . Although I can scarcely hope to see such perfection again , the quality that Stanislaysky called the dancer 's separation from the materiality of the body ' , my faith in the dance as a medium of expression has been increased . Today I go to the ballet in a spirit of exploration , in the hope that at one particular performance I will witness a theatrical miracle and be moved ; so deeply moved that the impressions of  | what I have seen is a lasting one . That supreme experience may only fall to one 's lot once or twice in a lifetime . I can however find pleasure at all the levels save the lowest , that of the technical feat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technique for its own sake bores and irritates me for the same reason that it bored and irritated Noverre two hundred years ago when he said : We must be prepared to sacrifice all the more complicated steps ; what we shall lose in movements of the feet we shall gain from the expressiveness of the arms .... However , it would be a misunderstanding of my aims to think that all I am looking for is to eliminate difficult and brilliant steps .... All those things are pure gold , but only if the mind makes them so . Just a few words about the words , if the mind makes them so ' . Sometimes for a very brief moment in a dancer 's career when she is dancing from the sheer joy of it , before she realizes that it is intensely difficult and before turning up nightly at the theatre has made her into a hardbitten professional , one might substitute the word instinct for mind . The young and unformed ballerinas launched by Colonel de Basil in 1933 , the year of the baby ballerinas ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were unable to reproduce later when mind took the place of instinct . That most beautiful of dancers , the late Pearl Argyle , has also left behind memories of many inspired performances . Many dancers well below the top rank can on some special occasion give us such rare moments of truth , and it is for these brief moments of truth that one waits in hope . And it is for that very reason that the filmed performance of a dance has so little to give . Not only do the conditions make it impossible for the dancers to achieve a miracle , but all too often one is watching a purely synthetic performance , a scissors-and-paste affair of a week 's shooting . We have started with eight or nine years of strenuous work before the public sees the dancer , with daily exercises throughout the dancer 's career , with hours of rehearsal , with much  | reprimand , and with very little praise . In fact with blood , sweat and tears ' . The dancer has achieved the ability to perform the most amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her body . Yet to me in the audience the supreme moment , the very essence of it all , may be a brief run across the stage or some fleeting passage in which the dancer is almost motionless . Then I know that my years of training as a spectator have been worthwhile and that I have received my reward . I am deeply grateful to the dancer who gives me that supreme thrill and to all the dancers who are striving .  | ROBERT WALLER It is possible to stand serenely aside from the practice of radio , television , and the film and to discuss their potentialities as art forms . It is equally possible to stand aside and denounce these media from a position of high snobbery . The author of this paper was invited because he had been intimately connected with Radio . For many years , he was a producer in London , where he often worked for the B.B.C. 's Third Programme ; later he was senior Talks Producer in the West Region . From this experience Mr. Waller has committed himself to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that no one can demolish it by saying that he does not know what he is talking about . What was said against his thesis at the symposium may be read in the record of the discussion at the end of the paper . SOMETIMES you hear a radio Producer say : It 's no use asking old So-and-So to write a script ; he 's an intelligent chap , but he wo n't accept the medium . ' I 've said this myself ? and with justification ; but it is nevertheless an observation that often makes me shudder . Frequently it means only that the broadcaster wo n't reduce his ideas to the level of expression demanded by a mass audience . But the medium and the audience are two different things . In discussing the influence on the arts of the mass media , it is essential to keep this distinction between the medium and the audience clearly in mind . I do n't wish to imply that the artist need not take account of his audience ; very far from it . Communicating a vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people as well as an immersion in a personal vision . The parables of the New Testament are a supreme  | example of a technique of communication . Nevertheless Jesus communicated his deepest secrets to the few and had something to say about casting pearls before swine . The artist can not always communicate to a mass audience ; some of the finest arts must essentially be for a limited and particular audience . If we are reduced to a condition in which there is only a mass audience , high art will disappear unless our civilization undergoes a radical change . Yet , but for the fact that certain media of communication such as film and radio can reach mass audiences , these media would not differ very much from other traditional means of artistic expression . Speech , paint , print , stone , pencil are all material used by man as artist to express himself : so is the voice , come to that , or , in acting , all the human body . Any of these can be , then , raw material of artistic expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , we have almost reached a stage where it no longer occurs to cultivated people that a medium of mass communication can be a medium of ART . We do n't talk of non-mass media as personal ' media ( or whatever the opposite of mass ' is ) : we just think of it as art . Yet the Talks Producer will always tell you : You must think of the listener sitting by himself by the fire ; you must talk to him personally . ' But you ca n't talk personally to such a large audience , except by using the arts of demagogy . If you talk personally to a dear friend you will be unhappily conscious that you 're being overheard by people who have no sympathy with you at all ? to whom you would n't dream of talking in this way : so you will talk in a pseudo-intimate way to an imaginary ordinary man . The radio set has created a unique psychological situation : it puts a personal presence ' into innumerable homes as a guest who has invited himself : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host and his friends . Unless this professional guest has acquired a technique of good manners for such an occasion , his presence is going to give offence ; and this applies , in a way , not only to the personal talk , but to the play or poem or feature which is a selfprojection of the artist . One may remember the rumpus over George Orwell 's 1984 . It 's no use saying , Well , if he does n't  | like me and my work , he should n't switch on . ' The wireless licensee has his set there and as a matter of common justice feels entitled to enjoy everything broadcast . He feels swindled if any programme is not to his taste . This irrational attitude to radio is , perhaps , due to the fact that all programmes issue from the same instrument , which is the owner 's personal possession and which cost him a good deal of money . Each newspaper programme , so to speak , has its own newspaper . The Light Programme ' newspaper reader need not torment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not wish to : the book reader need not exasperate himself with the sight of books he 'll never read . But the radio set is for ever his , staring at him . I can not think of any comparable psychological situation in history . Broadcasting is , therefore , confronted by the problem of whether it is to be an art in which each programme has either its special audience ? as it pretends ? or one mass audience . It ca n't have both . Every listener is not the same listener . But we are reaching a stage in our thinking in which we do not see the public as millions of different individuals who divide roughly into groups with special tastes , but as the common denominator , as one ordinary man ' . just as economists talk of the economic man , we must now talk of the Entertained Man ; and a vast set-up has been organized to discover what entertains him and to lay down the rules of success . Entertainment is becoming another sphere of automation , and machines could perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slang term for feeding an automatic machine is already ' programming it ' . This is interesting , for the audience and the entertainer make robots of each other . Commercial Correspondence Schools flourish that teach the mechanical rules of success that anyone can master . We are moving towards a machine substitute for consciousness . Printing was , 1 suppose , the first of the mass media and has a lot in common with radio considered purely as a medium . For example , when you print a poem you are only using print as a means of conveying the poem to other people . The poem is not  | written for reading silently from print , and should not be influenced by print . A poem is written for the voice . The medium of print does not make its own artistic demands so far as poetry is concerned , just as it should not so far as music is concerned . I do n't know if there is any music yet written simply to be read in the score . The true medium of music is the instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are poets who , knowing their work will be read and not heard , say to themselves , ' This can be more difficult , as it is written for a book , and the reader can keep reading it over and over again . ' If a poet writes for radio ( for the medium ' as the producer says ) , then he must say to himself : I must make this poem very simple ; I must try to keep to words of one syllable , for the listener will not be able to turn back the page ; he must understand the poem at once . ' Neither of these considerations is a true artistic consideration in my view ; they are distortions of inspiration resulting from a misconception of the nature of media . If a poet does not write for the voice and an intelligent audience , but for some imagined universal print or radio audience , he is betraying himself as a poet . There is therefore this double use of the mass media : to convey to a large audience some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and to serve as the material of art itself . Both are legitimate uses . One is so accustomed to print that one forgets that here , too , this applies . Though the printed word is an impersonal vehicle for poetry , it is the very condition of the novel . The novel is written to be read ; the novelist knows he can not get effects on the printed page in the same way as he could on the stage . He assumes , though , that his reader will not throw his novel away if he ca n't finish it in two hours , which is the time that a dramatist must hold his audience . The printed word is a medium making its own intrinsic artistic demands ; but when print becomes a mass medium , when the best-seller and the newspaper come on the scene , then it is not the exigencies of the word to be read that determines treatment , it is the taste of the mass reading public . We are now back with the common man ' , or perhaps we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a particularly interesting example of mass media because it existed before the mass civilization of today : when those civilizations developed it then became a mass medium . It is not the nature of the medium that determines its influence on the arts , but the civilization in which it is used . Perhaps the pressure of mass demand will in time make all arts mass-arts and invent means of mass distribution for them all . A time may come when even a painting will be assessed by its marketability as a printed reproduction . Music and poetry can both reach mass publics through radio ; most orchestras can only survive through the direct or indirect subsidies of broadcasting : and the broadcasting authorities have a say in programme choice . Even the theatre now tends to be dominated by the play that will run for years and cover the high costs of production . , In spite of all this , the microphone and the loudspeaker do provide a means of a highly refined art , because they exclude the visual ; arts are arts because of their chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , and with sounds of all kinds , within the framework of the loudspeaker , within this arena of pure sound . In a love scene you can not see the lovers ; you must evoke their feelings poetically with speech and with background effects of music , the sea or whatever is suitable . As everyone knows , a solitary seagull 's call will evoke seaports , ships , and shores . That 's a trite example ; the artist in sound radio will conceive subtler ones , if he 's given the chance . But severe limits are put on his subtlety , because the audience are not interested in any medium as art . They are interested in REALISMthat is , fundamentally , in themselves , their egos . They want to feel , as quickly as possible , familiar patterns of emotion without the mediation of high art , without the distortions of contemplation , without metaphor and symbol to which they are not accustomed . Thus , when television brings before their eyes a couple of real lovers slobbering all over each other and hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's eyes , well , sound radio ca n't compete . You have only to look on a station bookstall to see what the mass want to entertain them ,  | real life stories of erotic passion opening the way to social success . They like their natural being presented to them in such a form as to sanction it : jealousy , envy , hatred , and lust , what is called LIFE , is to the taste of the lowest common man and woman . Providing this in a form that does n't present the truth about passion and society is the whole art of success . So far as there is art in the mass media , it is the art of letting the natural man satisfy his desires within a moral framework ; and it is done by a number of easily acquired illusions . I come again to my chief point : that you can not give an audience an art that it does not want . There are immense possibilities of art in sound radio , television , and film , but the audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in a secular society that has no philosophy of passion , little conception of society as subordinate to God , and not much understanding of the divine in the natural . The mass audience does n't want poetry ; it wants stories of foiled seducers , of bad men chasing good women into the arms of good men , so that it can gratify its moral sense with the happy ending and its sexual lusts with the story . And since it is ignorant of the significance of passion , it likes dirty insinuations so that it can gloat over what it does n't understand . The puritan moralist tries to eliminate passion , cut it out by the roots . That is the worst attitude of all . Passion must be an eternal theme of life and art . The high arts have always been concerned with passion . There is a long tradition of passionate tragedy in European art ; passion is a form of suffering , intense to the point of longing for death ; men , in the past , have seen the choice between sacred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sought not the abandonment of passionate feeling but the refinement and purification of it ; they have seen the passion for God himself as the ultimate passion for which other passions are surrendered . The passionate man loves all creation and the incompatibilities of his passions lead to tragic situations . But such a view of passion is today incomprehensible . All romantic sexual passions , to judge by the films , have an infallible ending in happy marriage , to judge  | by the film stars in many happy marriages ! There can not be tragedy in a progressive society ; it can always find a rational answer . And so the old dramas linger on in a debased form with all their real meaning taken out of them : desire need not be redeemed or punished or sublimated . There are no Dantes . But no one who has ever suffered passion can accept such a debased assumption . If you listen to the popular love-songs of today , such as Eden ' or I Believe ' , you will find that they provide a religious sanction for lust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men , float upward like cats ' on a roof with a semi-religious accompaniment . The effect of this on the unregenerate multitudes puts Bacchus in the shade . You have all seen pictures of crooners being mobbed at railway stations and theatres . A decadent paganism with echoes of Christian religious music provides the spiritual nourishment of the masses . It is an entertainment to sit in the studio while a disc programme is being put out . Many of the technicians involved in putting out such programmes are emotionally superior to the disc jockeys , and pull faces at each other behind the compere and the producer ; but often enough the producer has to go home and be quietly sick . However , the producer is often enough in the same sort of position as the worker in the armament factory . Nevertheless , the defence of one 's country has some moral justification ; I suppose one can say that the armament worker does n't know if the arms he makes will be used for a just or an unjust cause . Maybe the people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing right or wrong . The people pay for the mass media ; without their support they would not be possible , so it is said . Broadcasting , newspapers , and the rest exist to serve the public . Is n't it , therefore , perhaps morally wrong not to give the public what it wants ? And is n't it perhaps priggish to dictate what the public ought to have ? If the multitude wanted our Lord to reign over Israel as a real king was n't he letting them down by refusing ? He seems to have been a bit of a cad ? democratically speaking . We must serve the people . ' That is the slogan that makes  | every evil of mass entertainment possible . We do n't serve the Holy Spirit , or Art or Truth ; we serve the people ' . The influence of mass media on the arts reflects the influence of society on the mass media . Technical invention ? that is , the invention of tools which are not actually a part of the human being himself ? has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier ; the other it to make our tasks more and more distant and less related to ourselves and our needs . Thus the invention of writing and printing enables the poet to take his poems to people who could never hear them if he were to stand on a mountain top and recite : they tempt him to forget that he writes for the voice and for an audience . Poetry is the supreme instance of an art killed by technical invention . The Greek dramatists , without printing , had huge audiences such as no modern poet , even with books , could hope to command . The only comparable decay would be to imagine music withoutmusical instruments simply read like books . The book of poems is too easy to shove on the shelf and forget . Yet , one might say , as optimists always do , radio will alter all that : now the poet reading his verse can be heard in every home . But , of course , it is too late to revive poetry ; it is not an inherent traditional need of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to revive it . People have not rushed to buy gramophone records of spoken poetry , which is a better medium still , since you can put the record on as often as you wish . Our use of technical inventions reflects our philosophy of life and the sort of people we are . Travel only diminishes our provincial egotism when we have learnt to value what is not ourselves ; travel often increases egotism when there has been no spiritual preparation . In the same way , one might think that , when the mass media open up the opportunity to ordinary people to become familiar with the arts , culture would flourish and men 's souls would broaden and enrich . That is a charming Victorian idea ; the temple doors of the palace of art have been opened to the masses and they have found nothing there ; they have made the splendid discovery that art is all an upper-class racket and when  | they hear the word culture they reach for their football pools . The enjoyment of art , like the enjoyment of travel , requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egotism invaded by forces that are outside oneself , unknown and unfamiliar . The souls of men deprived of religion are clamped down tight over their own egotism ; they want neither art , nor God , nor travel , nor the intrusion of coloured races into their sphere of consciousness . All they want to see is their own perfect image writ large over the universe . . . they want to hear exclusively about themselves on television , radio , and in parliament . The spiritual and artistic and political progress of mankind depends upon splitting open this subjective fortress , this unrelaxing central ego in the natural man . But far from any such attempt being made or regarded as necessary , the whole trend of society is to flatter egotism , pander to provincial taste , and make the natural man feel he is indeed the very voice of God on earth : to present the people to the people . The mass media are a means to power like gunpowder and nuclear fission . The wireless was not invented to provide a means of mass entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invented in order that people should kill each other . But war is a means to power ; and mass entertainment is also a means to power , and to vast fame and fortune . Like gunpowder and nuclear fission the mass media provide wonderful , dazzling opportunities for abuse . And one must confess that many of the most eminent figures in the country have succumbed to the temptation , and given this abuse their support and the camouflage of their names , as if a bishop should accept the post of grande dame in a brothel . Now what is peculiarly fascinating in our time is that all these abuses , which in the past could be kept within a limited sphere , can not any longer be kept under . The atomic bomb confronts man with the fact that if he goes on quarrelling with his brother he will annihilate himself ; the mass media in the sphere of the arts and culture have brought us face to face with the fact that we are going to be reduced to non-spiritual moronic animals . In the past small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's basic nature ; now nobody can . It is shouted in every home or flung before your eyes wherever you turn . Democracy , compulsory education , and a wider distribution of wealth ? have intensified all the moral problems . I imagine that the frescoes of Giotto were a mass art in their time ; when people could n't read , they taught them the spiritual truths of the Christian religion ; they must have been seen by a high percentage of the population of the time . So art intended for popular enjoyment need not be debased . The Greek theatre was n't , but the Roman theatre was . The need for vulgarity , sensationalism , and spectacle is always present in a bored population that has no creative work to do . The factory bench created the audience for the mass media and the press barons and the publishing houses and the broadcasting authorities set out to gratify it , or they found themselves compelled to gratify these tastes , whichever way you look at it . For unless this need is gratified none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be placed on a sound financial basis . The trap is perfect . The vicious circle has no break in it . The temptation is absolute . Destiny has set the tycoons of entertainment a problem of survival that allows of no compromise and no weakening . It never , almost never , occurs to a tycoon that in the eyes of God it may be salvation to fail and damnation to succeed . So there will be no compromise . In industrial town and factory , the workers on monotonous machines often exhausted , so far as the imagination is concerned , by overtime , provide the bored audience hungering to feel something , hungering to live , hungering for the quickest ways of feeling emotion , hungering for sensation and spectacle : and the tycoons are there to give it to them as if they were charitable benefactors . Now the Greeks with their sense of destiny would have seen this for what it is ? a tragic and irreversible doom laid on mankind at a particular time in history . In a Christian assembly one may point this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pessimist . Christianity redeemed the Roman Empire from its materialistic doom partly because it recognized that the spirit is  | always crucified , that the world always and actively persecutes the spirit ; in our day it does this by ignoring its existence . Christianity recognizes the tragedy of existence . But the Christianity of the mass today is a mere lingering sentimentalism ; religion is not for them a judgment of themselves , it is a glorification of their way of life . A civilization which fixes its spiritual sights on the average fallen sinner , not to lift him up , but just to distract him from his real state of being , will get the sort of art and entertainment , the sort of culture it deserves . . . and that the Romans had to an even more extreme degree than we have . Ordinariness is protected by its numbers ; so many millions ca n't be wrong . If audience research says millions enjoyed a programme it must be good . That is our rule of judgment and evaluation . It looks as if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary man . Not at all . I am campaigning against the cult of the ordinary man ; for this cult is not a safeguard against tyranny , dictatorship , and vulgarity . It 's the quickest way to it . Yet in the long run I think we shall find that the ordinary man grows sick of his own taste writ large over everything . The politicians and business men who have made him into God for the purpose of selling him themselves and their products will find that he will turn against them and accuse them of debauching him . It is not easy to resist the free gratification of daydreams , whether they be Hitlerian dreams of Empire , the Communists ' dream of equality imposed by force , or the factory girl 's dream of a rich lover . But those who deprive us of our sense of reality by selling us these dreams are in the end recognized , I think , as public enemies ; even though the dreams , being latent in nature , spring up again in due course . The world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destiny and the great religions recognize their place and their reality . The non-religious societies do n't . The ordinary man is superior to the culture which is served up to him , which he demands and apparently enjoys . Culture is part of the whole social background of a people . The powers of ' artistic expression are not aroused in the  | modern world ; the real character of ordinary people is never more than latent . Our cities and our education system and our organization of life do not stimulate the imagination and arouse the passions , except , one is tempted to say , in war . Culture and truth are inter-related and the beginning of culture is to tell the truth about what is felt ; and that is what our culture does not do . We do n't present man as he is or man as he should be . To present him cynically as a victim of fate is not true ; he has visions of better things and can work better things . To present everything as perfect is worse still ; merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present unrealizable and false dreams as art is treachery to the audience . In my view the educated have betrayed the semi-educated and they are now scared of the proletarian mass whose greed they have created ; strikes and the like are a revolt of slaves , luxury slaves , but slaves nevertheless in terms of their monotonous work . The politicians are in a panic ; they can think of nothing better than to bribe the mass with bread and circuses ? of which commercial television is the most recent example . Putting the whole apparatus of television at the mercy of commercial advertising is a very odd conception of freedom . I am opposed to the B.B.C. 's monopoly myself , but this anarchy is worse . T.V. is now literally bringing the Roman circus into the home . It is simply the cultural domination of the mass . Yes , the Roman circus has come to the hearth . Indeed , if we look back to second-century Rome we see a civilization with a startling similarity to our own . I would say that between the Rome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind has existed . For second-century Rome was governed by the needs and tastes of an urban proletariat . It had also an educated bureaucracy that manipulated a welfare state in some ways more indulgent than our own ; it had a number of highly cultivated families , who lived a Bloomsbury-like existence more or less indifferent to the decadence and slavery of the rest , provided they could have their exquisite enjoyments ; it had religious tolerance , provided no criticism were made of its social system ; and it had free entertainments . And what entertainments !  | This situation killed any possibility of great art , except the work of the occasional satirist like Juvenal or Martial . The only passion that inspired the sensitive was disgust . We see here the ideal condition of the mass media ? the undifferentiated , bored , urban proletariat hungering for excitement and entertainment , and constituting a political estate . So the Colosseum was built and filled with ceaseless entertainment from morning till night at the State 's expense for a quarter of a million spectators . The Colosseum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was to gratify the bored passions of an urban mob running into a million . The wise emperors vied with the worst in this debauchery of pleasure and squandering of money : and the most ostentatious , the most apparently foolish in the matter was perhaps Trajan , the model emperor whose perfection was held to be worthy of Jupiter . In reality , as Fronto saw it , his wisdom never failed to pay attention to the stars of the theatre , the circus or the arena , for he knew well that the excellence of government lay no less in its care for the amusements of the people than in serious matters , and that although the distribution of corn and money might satisfy the individual , spectacle was necessary for the contentment of the masses . The brutality of the Roman spectacle is not yet on the radio . But it is on the way . Already it is found in the horror comics with their immense circulation . However , listen to this from The Observer of Sunday , 3 March 1957 . Maurice Richardson writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocked by Superman than by anything I have yet seen on television . I honestly believe it might be possible to catch schizophrenia from this fantasm , if your sense of reality was at a low ebb . It is deeply regressive , without a trace of constructive imagination that redeems the crudest science fiction . Superman , a jowly muscleman thinly disguised as a newspaper reporter with horn-rimmed spectacles and Brooks Bros. suit over his posing slip , defies all the physical laws in a contemporary setting . He flies , just like that . A giant gorilla 's stone cosh , brought down on his  | head with all the force of a giant gorilla 's right arm , shatters into fragments . The pressure of his hand-grip converts a lump of coal into diamond . This takes you straight back to the phenomenon which 1-reud called the omnipotence of thoughts ' , that overestimation of the power of wishes and mental processes which amounts to a sort of infant 's megalomania . It may serve its purpose in the cradle . It might be permissible as a comic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow it up into a film ( live , not cartoon ) and put it on for half-an-hour at a time when boys should be doing their homework is the most defiant gesture yet made in the name of the Idiot 's Lantern , cretinocracy rampant . I would sooner serialize lflalleus Mal ficorum than miserable dementia . The effect of the tradition of Christian morals has been to make it difficult to stage gladiatorial combats or throw people we do n't like to the lions ? we throw them to the quizzers . So the thirst for perpetual amusement has needed other gratifications . It is being assuaged by a deluge of triviality ; endless facts and information unrelated to the spiritually significant , adults playing children 's games and the like . One might be tempted to say that Christianity has served no better purpose than to turn Thoughts and afflictions , passions , Hell itself to favours and to prettiness . ' We may echo Pliny the Younger : Such favour , such weighty influence , hath one worthless charioteer 's tunic ? I say nothing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with certain grave personages . When I observe such men thus insatiably fond of so silly , so low , so uninteresting , so common an entertainment , I congratulate myself that I am insensible to such pleasures . ' We know , too , that under these conditions of mass values the Roman tragedy declined into the modern musical . The producer ' , says M. Carpino in his fine book Daily Life in Ancient Rome , mercilessly cut the traditional texts of plays and clipped the dialogue , so that after the scissors had done their worst a tragedy consisted of little but lyrics more or less skilfully punctuated by scraps of dialogue . The Roman impressarios thought not of serving a work of art but of exploiting it , '  | The similarities between their mass culture and ours are innumerable . It is all based on fear of losing popularity on the part of the ruling classes ? or anyway the people with power . Mass entertainment is in fact the ladder to power . And it all leads to hopeless vulgarity and finally to the collapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so attached to horse racing that , when the barbarian was at the gate , they left a Pope to go and challenge him , while they continued with their gambling . The Roman Empire did many fine things ; we do many fine things ; we still do them even in the sphere of mass entertainment ; but subordination of judgment to popularity dragged down Rome and is dragging us down too . There must be some standard of judgment that is spiritual and transcendent ; some discipline of nature such as high art provides ; even artists themselves are full of human frailty . It is within the bounds of possibility that the mass media will ultimately kill the arts in this country . If they do n't , it will be because our whole civilization has seen the light about its general philosophy of life . You ca n't buy out the Spirit any more than you can the barbarian . The Spirit will finish you off and start again if you do n't pay a proper and humble tribute to its demands . The discussion tended toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by exaggeration , but this was not entirely clear . There was some anxiety lest the author should seem to be speaking disparagingly of uneducated people or of democracy ; he was in fact referring to the cult of the common man ' and the cult of democracy ' . There was agreement that , in any case , in every society the greatest achievements ? spiritual , religious , artistic ? inevitably proceed from small minority groups . An important matter was raised about the televising of the Christian liturgy . Horror at what had been done in this respect was expressed by more than one person present . With due deference to the Benedictine hosts of the symposium it was suggested that the televising of High Mass was against the Christian tradition . It was pointed out that the Mass is divided into two parts , the Mass of the catechumens , that is of those who are  | being instructed , which may well be open to all people , but that the rest of the Mass is a sacred religious act of the Christian body and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearls before swine . Another person specified the trouble more precisely . Television is a spectacle , but the liturgy is a religious act in which every person present takes part ; it is just because most Christians have forgotten what the liturgy is , it is just because they do in fact normally regard it merely as a spectacle which they watch , that they are not shocked by its introduction on a television programme .  | JOHN MARSHALL Dr. John Marshall is Director of the Academic Unit in Neurology , of the Institute of Neurology of London University and the National Hospital for Nervous Diseases . He was invited to provide the symposium with information about the physical basis of perception . Since each human being is a single whole it seemed wrong to suppose that the physical means by which we become aware of the arts , our senses , could be ignored in a study of the arts . Dr. Marshall provided this exposition of the information for which we asked . IT is difficult in a symposium in which the Arts are so widely and strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpful or meaningful . He must walk a tight-rope between two errors . His presentation may be so full of facts couched in a technical jargon that slumber rapidly overtakes his audience . Alternatively , in an endeavour to stimulate and maintain interest , he may propose intriguing hypotheses which , though initially related to known facts , develop during their elaboration an increasingly tenuous connexion with reality . Faced with this dilemma , I have taken a pusillanimous course , and will say in effect that science is science and art is art , and though one day the twain may meet , such a prospect does not , as yet , lighten our horizon . I shall give some account of the mechanism of the simple structures which make up the nervous system , on which our appreciation of the Arts is entirely dependent ; I shall endeavour to indicate how the activity of these simple structures is utilized ; I shall relate some effects of sensory deprivation upon the human organism ; and I shall conclude by emphasizing the yawning chasm which exists  | between the account which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as seen in the world of Arts . The nervous system exists for no other purpose than to convey information . It is a signalling system whereby messages can be carried from one place to another . Information from the world without impinges upon receptors such as the eye , the ear , the nose , and the tactile organs in the skin where it is translated into a series of impulses which travel along nerves to the brain . Information from the world within us is likewise picked up by specialized receptors and conveyed centrally . Hence I know that I am thirsty or satiated , hungry or replete , that my heart is beating quickly or that my muscles are tired . The traffic is not only one way , for identical impulses travelling outwards may cause my hand to be raised , my mouth to water , or my pupils to constrict . It is well to remember , however , that of itself the nervous system can effect nothing . The High Command may send the signal for the attack , but effective action depends upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the translation of impulses in the nervous system into effective action requires the presence of muscles which will move the limb , or of glands which will pour forth their secretion . There is , of course , a defect in the military analogy , for the troops are capable of action independently of or even in opposition to commands , whereas the effectors of the nervous system obey without question . There is another aspect of this activity which must be mentioned , and that is the question of awareness . We have no direct knowledge in ourselves of the actual passage of information along our nerves . We feel the cool breeze blowing on our skin or hear the sound of voices falling on the ear , but of the nervous processes mediating these experiences we have no awareness . More surprising perhaps is the fact that we are not always aware of the activity of the effector organs . Thus , though we may know when we raise our hands , we do not , and can not , by any amount of introspection know when our pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast number of semi-automatic activities of which we may become aware by taking thought .  | Walking is a good example , for though we may by introspection take great interest in our gait , usually it is an activity which is automatic and to which we pay no attention . The nervous system is , therefore , a signalling system . Let us consider for a moment how the information is conveyed . The elucidation of this fascinating chapter in physiology is a good example of how science works in this field . Our task is made easier by the fact that though nerve fibres are of different lengths and different diameters , their mode of action is uniform . A nerve fibre consists of a tube or cylinder , the wall of which is composed of a membrane which has remarkable properties . Within the tube is a watery solution and suspension of chemical substances known as axoplasm . The most striking property of the enclosing membrane is its ability to allow some substances to pass through it freely , while remaining impermeable to others . Thus potassium and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ions are kept out . This active separation of chemical substances results in an electrical potential being developed on the membrane of the order of one hundred millivolts ( a millivolt is one thousandth of a volt ) , which is quite a high potential for a biological system . To what end is this exclusion of sodium from within the nerve fibre ? If the potential at the surface of the membrane is slightly diminished by any means , immediately sodium begins to flow into the fibre and potassium passes out . This flux of ions is the genesis of the nerve impulse , for the movement is accompanied by an electrical disturbance which lowers the potential of the adjacent part of the membrane through which in turn sodium begins to flow , and so the process is propagated along , the nerve fibre . This process underlying the passage of an impulse in a nerve fibre is extremely simple , but the final analysis conveys no hint of the work involved in its elucidation . The description a tube or cylinder ' tends to enlarge our mental picture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large water main , the inner and outer environments of which can readily be analysed . It is therefore chastening to remember that the largest nerve fibre , the giant  | axon of the squid , is about o ? 5 millimetre in diameter , and that most nerve fibres are very much smaller than this . How then have physiologists obtained their information ? Various approaches have been made , and it may be of interest to indicate one or two of these . The electrical potential of the membrane has been measured directly by making a glass electrode of one-thousandth of a millimetre diameter , and introducing it under microscopic control into the nerve fibre . Such a process is easily described but less easily executed . Replacing the potassium by radio-active potassium and then measuring its content by means of ' a Geiger counter is another method which has been used . A third line of attack has been to extrude the axoplasm from a large fibre which , you will remember , is only o ? S millimetre in diameter , and to analyse it by microchemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entail a high degree of technical skill and perseverance , but it is by such means that the knowledge of the nature of the nerve impulse has been obtained . Now why have I , in defiance of my initial declaration about the danger of too technical an approach to my subject , elaborated to such an extent the mechanism underlying the passage of an impulse in a nerve fibre ? My reason is as follows : when we are stirred by the beauty of a picture , when we are enthralled by the pattern of the dance , or when we are roused by the climax of a symphony , a prosaic but essential step in our appreciation is the flow of countless ions of sodium and potassium in accordance with a pattern , which rivals in its order and faultless perfection that of the dance we may be witnessing . Between the movement of ions on the one hand and our total appreciation of the artistic situation on the other , lies a large abyss of which it might be said : Between the idea And the reality Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S. Eliot : The Hollow Men .  | That the shadow of our ignorance falls heavily between the extremes I have delineated can not be doubted , but I think it is valuable for us to appreciate at the outset the parameters of our subject . Let us now look a little farther and see how the passage of impulses conveys sensory information from the periphery to the centre in order that we may enjoy artistic endeavour . All nervous impulses are alike , consisting , as has been described , of movements of ions accompanied by an electrical disturbance which , because of the ease with which it may be recorded , is a convenient outward sign of the disturbance within the nerve . How can identical impulses convey information which may differ widely in its character ? There are several methods by which the nervous system deals with this problem . One way is by the implication of a greater or lesser number of fibres . Thus the pressure of a knife edge upon the skin will excite only a limited number of fibres as compared with that exerted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of fibres involved will reflect to some extent the size and shape of the stimulating object . A second way is by the number of impulses which flow in a single fibre . Thus the weight of an object will be reflected in the frequency of the impulses passing along any individual nerve fibre supplying the supporting muscle ; the greater the weight the higher will be the rate of discharge of nerve impulses . But the most important method of obtaining information and making it available to the nervous system is by the development of specialized receptors such as the eye and ear . These organs , as is apparent , respond to one kind of stimulus only . It is of no avail to shine a light in the ear ; sound is the efficient stimulus for this organ and only to sound does it respond . Likewise the eye responds to light and the nose to scents . Thus , though the impulses in the auditory , optic , and olfactory nerves are identical , the information which they convey is different because the receptors which excite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The appearance of these receptors in higher forms of animal life has , therefore , extended enormously the range of appreciation which is possible .  | The development of the specialized sensory receptors did not see an end to the degree of differentiation carried out by the nervous system . The eye does not simply respond to light , but by its agency we can appreciate lights of different colours . How this is achieved is not known for certain , the most acceptable hypothesis being the trichromatic theory . This envisages that the receptor cells , known as cones , are of three types , each of which responds to only a limited part of the light spectrum . Mixing of light from the different parts of the spectrum gives us the phenomenon we call colour , hence the proportional excitation of the three types of receptor is the basis of our colour appreciation . This has a wide range , for it has been estimated that as many as 165- hues can be distinguished . The artist presumably has a greater awareness of the vast potentiality of his colour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentiality in a sensory modality is worth examining a little farther . There can be little doubt that the great majority of us glean only a fraction of the information that our sense organs are capable of gathering . Proof of this is seen in the remarkable achievements of those who , for some reason , are deprived of one form of sense experience , and so develop the potentialities of other senses beyond all expectation . The tactile and auditory abilities of the blind are too well known to require elaboration here . The most outstanding example of this compensatory development is surely Helen Keller , who , though blind and deaf , has achieved so much by means of her sense of smell and touch . Describing a drive with her , Frederick Tilney , the American neurologist , relates : Her first observation was that we were then making our way through open fields . This proved to be the case , for the road ran through a golf course . Later , she said we were passing trees . The road at this point made its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that we , had just passed a house with an open fire , and looking back I saw a small cottage with smoke pouring out of its chimney ... . Shortly after this Miss Keller called attention to the fact that we had just entered Garden City and were passing the plant of Doubleday  | and Doran , her publishers , which actually was the case . Her realization of this fact , she told me , was due to her olfactory recognition of the ink from the presses of this publishing establishment , with which she was familiar.1 In describing the importance of the sense of smell in her life , Helen Keller herself wrote : I wonder how many people are aware of the complex odours in a house that has been lived in for a long time . They give me a comfortable sense of hospitality . They suggest cheery winter fires and peace and sweet family intimacies . There are lingering scents of perfume and garments in closets and drawers , and appetizing odours of cooking which some people find extremely unpleasant , but which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of our sensory capacity must impoverish our appreciation of the arts . For not only is knowledge of the particular discipline required for a full appreciation of an artistic creation , but also the ability to absorb completely the sensory data which the medium presents to us . Experience may indicate what features are important , and for what we should look or listen , just as in medicine the doctor seeks certain signs because he knows their significance . But does not training also develop the discriminatory powers of the sensory mechanism , quite apart from our awareness of the need to direct it to the relevant points ? I should think it does , and the colour discrimination of the artist or the tone perception of the musician is greater than that of the untutored person by reason of his training . The importance of sensory experience in our lives has been emphasized by observation of the effect of sensory deprivation . These observations have come from two sources . One is of patients whose sensory pathways have been interrupted by disease so that the patient receives little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie immobile with open eyes but taking no heed of what is happening around . Spontaneous movement is absent , and it is only the most vigorous stimulation that will provoke a reaction . The patient is also mute .
