The Queens area is predominantly white . The appeal from the plan was made last month by the Glendale Taxpayers Association . A spokesman told the board then that the area 's residents " just do n't like the idea of strangers coming into their neighborhood . " Integration Not Goal Charles H.

In rejecting the Glendale ap I peal , the board denied the association 's contention that carry // ing children from one borough to another was contrary to the board 's policy . Mr. Silver said that the board considered the city 's school districting as an entity and did not see it as divided into boroughs . The board 's move was commended yesterday by the Commission on Intergroup Relations . However , the commission said that it would seek clarification of the statement that it was a temporary emergency move . Dr. Frank S. Home , executive director of the city commission , expressed " concern about this statement in view of the board 's clearly stated policy and program to prevent further development of segregated schools and to improve ethnic balance in all schools wherever possible . " The Queens schools to receive the Negro pupils are Public Schools 68 , 77 , 81 , 88 and 91 . The pupils involved in the shift are in the third , fourth and ' fifth grades .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
