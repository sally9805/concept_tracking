By 6:30 Thanksgiving Eve , the staff of Alicia Patterson 's scrappy , prosperous ( circ. 130,000 ) Long Island tabloid , Newsday , was well scattered , and the plant at Garden City was shut down . The paper planned to stay closed over the holiday . Then Reporter Bob Hollingsworth , who had stopped in a bar for a drink on his way home , caught a radio news bulletin . There had been a disastrous wreck on the Long Island Rail Road ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) . Hollingsworth tried frantically to locate Managing Editor Alan Hathway by phone , made four calls before he ran him down having dinner in a Chinese restaurant . By the time Hathway hustled back to the office , other staffers who had heard the news were also hurrying in and the list of wreck casualties was up to 50 . Though the radio has just about killed off the newspaper trick of putting out extras as circulation boosters , Newsday 's department heads decided to put one out " as a public service . " Hathway " got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants and the movies . " By 11 p.m. the mechanical staff was in and 32 editorial men were working on one of the biggest local stories in Newsday 's ten-year history . By 6 a.m. a 16-page extra was ready to go to press with long lists of the dead and injured plus 25 stories and pages of pictures . Within a few hours , all of the 100,000 home subscribers had their extra , and another 50,000 copies of Newsday were on newsstands . But Newsday did n't pat itself on the back for its progressive journalism . Instead , it candidly confessed that in one way it had fallen down on its journalistic job , that it had not done all it could to prevent the accident from happening . Said Newsday somberly : " We have known for years that the Long Island Rail Road was in deplorable condition . The wreck at Rockville Centre TIME , Feb. 27 tipped us off to the dangers . . . Yet we did too little . . . People forget . And Newsday , being people , and being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , etc. , has not lifted its voice as loudly as we might have done . All we can do is cop a plea . The job of alarm we have done has only been fair . "
