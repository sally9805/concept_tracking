A Story by Charles G. Finney Drawings by Gil Walker The Life and Death of a Western Gladiator H E WAS born on a summer morning in the shady mouth of a cave . Three others were born with him , another male and two females . Each was about five inches long and slimmer than a lead pencil . Their mother left them a few hours after they were born . A day after that his brother and sisters left him also . He was all alone . Nobody cared whether he lived or died . His tiny brain was very dull . He had no arms or legs . His skin was delicate . Nearly everything that walked on the ground or burrowed in it , that flew in the air or swam in the water or climbed trees was his enemy . But he did n't know that . He knew nothing at all . He was aware of his own existence , and that was the sum of his knowledge . The direct rays of the sun could , in a short time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would freeze . Without food he would starve . Without moisture he would die of dehydration . If a man or a horse stepped on him he would he crushed . If anything chased him he could run neither very far nor very fast . Thus it was at the hour of his birth . Thus it would be , with modifications , all his life . But against these drawbacks he had certain qualifications that fitted him to be a competitive creature of this world and equipped him for its warfare . He could exist a long time without food or water . His very smallness at birth protectedhim when he most needed protection . Instinct provided him with what he lacked in experience . In order to eat he first had to kill ; and he was eminently adapted for killing . In sacs in his jaws he secreted a virulent poison , To inject that poison he had two fangs , hollow and pointed . Without that poison and those tangs he would have been among the most helpless creatures on earth . With diem he was among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby rattlesnake , a desert diamondback , named Crotalus atrox by the herpetologists Baird and Girard and so listed in the Catalogue of North American Reptiles in its issue of 1853 . He was grayish brown in color with a series of large dark diamond-shaped blotches on his back . His tail was white with five black cross-bands . It had a button on the end of it . Little Crotalus lay in the dust in the mouth of his cave . Some of his kinfolk lay there too . It was their home . That particular tribe of rattlers had lived there for scores of years . The cave had never been seen by a white man . Sometimes as many as two hundred rattlers occupied the den . Sometimes the numbers shrunk to as few as forty or fifty . The tribe members did nothing at all for each other except breed . They hunted singly ; they never shared their food . They derived some automatic degree of safety from their numbers , WESTERN GLADIATOR but their actions were never concerted toward using their numbers to any end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others did nothing about it . Young Crotalus 's brother was the first of the litter to go out into the world and the first to ( lie . He achieved a distance of fifty feet from the den when a Sonoran racer , font- feet long and hungry , came upon him . The little rattler , despite his poison fangs , was a tidbit . The racer , long skilled in such arts , snatched him up by the head and swallowed him clown . Powerful digestive juices in the racer 's stomach did the rest .. Then the racer , appetite whetted , prowled around until it found one of Crotalus 's little sisters . She went the way of the brother . Nemesis of the second sister was a chaparral cock . This cuckoo , or road runner as it is called , Found the baby amid some rocks , uttered a cry of delight , scissored it by the neck , shook it until it was almost lifeless , banged and pounded it upon a rock until life had indeed left it , and then gulped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cave 's mouth , neither knew nor cared . Even if he had , there was nothing he could have done about it . 0 N THE fourth day of his life he decided to go out into the world himself . He rippled forth uncertainly , the transverse plates on his belly serving him as legs . He could see things well enough within his limited range , but a five-inch-long snake can command no great field of vision . He had an excellent sense of smell . But , having no ears , he was stone deaf . On the other hand , he had a pit , a deep pock mark between eye and nostril . Unique , this organ was sensitive to animal heat . In pitch blackness , Crotalus , by means of the heat messages recorded in his pit , could tell whether another animal was near and could also judge its size . That was better than an ear . The single button on his tail could not , of course , yet rattle . Crotalus would n't be able to rattle until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be able to buzz . He had a wonderful tongue . It looked like an exposed nerve and was probably exactly that . It was forked , and Crotalus thrust it in and out as he traveled . It told him things that neither his eyes nor his nose nor his pit told him . Snake fashion , Crotalus went forth , not knowing where he was going , for he had never been anywhere before . Hunger was probably his prime mover . In order to satisfy that hunger he had to find something smaller than himself and kill it . He came upon a baby lizard sitting in the sand . Eyes , nose , pit , and tongue told Crotalus it was there . Instinct told him what it was anti what to do . Crotalus gave a tiny one-inch strike and bit the lizard . His poison killed it . He took it by the head and swallowed it . Thus was his first meal . During his first two years Crotalus grew rapidly . He attained a length of two feet ; his tail had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothered with lizards any more , preferring baby rabbits , chipmunks , and round-tailed ground squirrels . Because of his slow locomotion he could not run down these agile little things . He had to contrive instead to be where they were when they would pass . Then he struck swiftly , injected his poison , and ate them after they died . At two he was formidable . He had grown past the stage where a racer or a road runner could safely tackle him . He had grown to the size where other desert dwellers  --  coyotes , foxes , coatis , wildcats  --  knew it was better to leave him alone . And , at two , Crotalus became a father , his life being regulated by cycles . His cycles were plantlike . The peach tree does not " know " when it is time to flower , but flower it does because its cycle orders it to do so . In the same way , Crotalus did not " know " when it was time for young desert diamondback rattlers to pair off and breed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a rainy morning . Crotalus 's courtship at first was sinuous and subtle , slow and stealthy . Then suddenly it became dynamic . A period of exhaustion followed . Two metabolic machines had united to produce new metabolic machines . Of that physical union six new rattlesnakes were born . Thus Crotalus , at two , had carried out his major primary function : he had reproduced his kind . In two years he had experienced everything that was reasonably possible for desert diamondback rattlesnakes to experience except death . He had not experienced death for the simple reason that there had never been an opportunity for anything bigger and stronger than himself to kill him . Now , at two , because he was so formidable , that opportunity became more and more unlikely . He grew more slowly in the years following his initial spurt . At the age of twelve he was five feet long . Few of the other rattlers in his den were older or larger than he . He had a castanet of fourteen segments . It had been broken off occasionally in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ segment appeared , His first skin-shedding back in his babyhood had been a bewildering experience . He did not know what was happening . His eyes clouded over until he could not see . His skin thickened and dried until it cracked in places . His pit and his nostrils ceased to function . There was only one thing to do and that was to get out of that skin . Crotalus managed it by nosing against the bark of a shrub until he forced the old skin down over his head , bunching it like the rolled top of a stocking around his neck . Then he pushed around among rocks and sticks and brandies , literally crawling out of his skin by slow degrees . Wriggling free at last , he looked like a brand new snake . His skin was bright and satiny , his eyes and nostrils were clear , his pit sang with sensation . For the rest of his life he was to molt three or four times a year . Each time he did it he felt as if he had been born again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single scar defaced his rippling symmetry . He was diabolically beautiful and deadly poison . His venom was his only weapon , for he had no power of constriction . Yellowish in color , his poison was odorless and tasteless . It was a highly complex mixture of proteids , each in itself direly toxic . His venom worked on the blood . The more poison he injected with a bite , the more dangerous the wound . The pain rendered by his bite was instantaneous . and the shock accompanying it was profound . Swelling began immediately , to be followed by a ghastly oozing . Injected directly into a large vein , his poison brought death quickly , for the victim died when it reached his heart . At the age of twenty Crotalus was the oldest and largest rattler in his den . He was six feet long and weighed thirteen pounds . His whole world was only about a mile in radius . He had fixed places where he avoided the sun when it was hot and he was away from his cave . He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal burrow . He was a fine old machine , perfectly adapted to his surroundings , accustomed to a life ofleisure and comfort . He dominated his little world . The mighty seasonal rhythms of the - desert were as vast pulsations , and the lives of the rattlesnakes were attuned to them . Spring sun beat clown , spring rains fell , and , as the plants of the desert ended their winter hibernations , so did Lite vipers in their lair . The plants opened forth and budded ; the den " opened . ' too , and the snakes crawled forth . The plants fertilized each other , and new plants were born . The snakes bred , and new snakes were produced . The desert was repopulated . In the autumn the plants began to close ; in the same fashion the snake den began to close . the reptiles returned to it , lay like lingering blossoms about its entrance for a while , then disappeared within it when winter came . There they slept until summoned forth by a new spring . Crotalus was twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viperhood . B U T men were approaching . Spilling out of their cities , men were settling in that part of the desert where Crotalus lived . They built roads and houses , set up fences , dug for water , planted crops . They homesteaded the land . They brought new animals with them  --  cows , horses , dogs , cats , barnyard fowl . The roads they built were death traps for the desert dwellers . Every morning new dead bodies lay on the roads , the bodies of the things the men had run over and crushed in their vehicles . That summer Crotalus met his first clog . It was a German shepherd which had been reared on a farm in the Midwest and there had gained the reputation of being a snake-killer . Black snakes , garter snakes , pilots , water snakes ; it delighted in killing them all . It would seize them by the middle , heedless of their tiny teeth , and shake them violently until they died . This dog met Crotalus face to face in the desert at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . Neither did the dog fear Crotalus , although Crotalus then was six feet long , as thick in the middle as a motorcycle tire , and had a head the size of a man 's clenched fist . Also this snake buzzed and buzzed and buzzed . The dog was brave , and a snake was a snake . The German shepherd snarled and attacked . Crotalus struck him in the underjaw ; his fangs sank in almost half an inch and squirted big blobs of hematoxic poison into the tissues of the dog 's flesh . The shepherd bellowed with pain , backed off , groveled with his jaws in the desert sand , and attacked again . He seized Crotalus somewhere by the middle of his body and tried to flip him in the air and shake him as , in the past , he had shaken slender black snakes to their death . In return , he received another poison-blurting stab in his flank it could sink its fangs . The German shepherd had enough . He dropped the big snake and in sick , agonizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died . The homesteader looked at his dead dog and became alarmed . If there was a snake around big enough to kill a dog that size , it could also kill a child and probably a man . It was something that had to be eliminated . The homesteader told his Fellow farmers , and they agreed to initiate a war of extermination against the snakes . The campaign during the summer was sporadic . The snakes were scattered over the desert , and it was only by chance that the men came upon them . Even so , at summer 's end , twenty-six of the vipers had been killed . When autumn came the men decided to look for the rattlers ' den and execute mass slaughter . The homesteaders had become desert-wise and knew what to look for . They found Crotalus 's lair without too much trouble  --  a rock outcropping on a slope that faced the south . Cast-off skins were in evidence in the bushes . Bees flew idly in and out of the den 's mouth . Convenient benches and shelves of rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final sunning in the autumn air . They killed the three rattlers they found at the den when they first discovered it . They made plans to return in a few more days when more of the snakes had congregated . They decided to bring along dynamite with them and blow up the mouth of the den so that the snakes within would be sealed there forever and the snakes without would have no place to find refuge . On the clay the men chose to return nearly fifty desert diamondbacks were gathered at the portals of the cave . The men shot them , clubbed them , smashed them with rocks . Some of the rattlers escaped the attack and crawled into the den . C ROTALUS had not yet arrived for the autumn rendezvous . He came that night . The den 's mouth was a shattered mass of rock , for the men had done their dynamiting well . Dead members of his tribe lay everywhere . Crotalus nosed among them , tongue flicking as he slid slowly along . There was no access to the cave any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The morning suit warmed him and awakened him . He lay there at full length . He had no place to go . The sun grew hotter upon him and instinctively be began to slide toward some dark shade . Then his senses warned him of some animal presence near by ; he stopped , half coiled , raised his head and began to rattle . He saw two upright figures . He did not know what they were because he had never seen men before . " That 's the granddaddy of them all , " said one of the homesteaders . " It 's a good thing we came back . " He raised his shotgun .
