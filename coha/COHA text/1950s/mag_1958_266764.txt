The hulking ( 260 Ibs. ) six-footer told the desk sergeant in Crawfordsville , Ind . that while he was working on a nearby farm , some baling wire had stuck in his legs . He had had a tetanus shot , he added , but by now the pain was terrible : he could barely walk , needed medical attention-but could not pay for it . He was , he said , Leo Lamphere , 47 , of Watertown , N.Y . The sympathetic sergeant called a doctor who saw what looked like clots in the veins on both ' Lamphere 's legs , ordered him to Culver Union Hospital . There Lamphere began spitting blood . He was put to bed , acted like a grateful model patient . That was a fortnight ago . <P> Next day one of the Culver staff saw a news story about a " hospital bum " who could bring up blood at will . The story was based on an article in the A.M.A. Journal by Iowa City 's Dr. John S. Chapman describing a galloping case of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1951 ) and warning hospitals against this itinerant who , strangely , always used the same name . Hospital Superintendent Ralph Haas phoned Iowa City to ask Dr. Chapman the man 's name . " Leo Lamphere , " was the reply . Soon , into Lamphere 's room marched two deputy sheriffs with a warrant charging vagrancy . The " patient " was lying in a bloodstained bed with an oxygen tube up his nose . " Come along , " said a deputy . Lamphere pulled the tube out of his nose , kicked off the bed cover , snapped : " I can dress myself . " While hovering nurses protested that he was too sick to be moved , Lamphere was led off to jail . <P> " Indiana Cyclone . " His case history , as told by Dr. Chapman , is one of the longest and strangest in medical annals . For 40 days in 1954 , Lamphere kept the State University of Iowa hospitals in turmoil . He had arrived complaining of anguish from pain in the left chest ; he obviously had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded and got a narcotic to relieve the pain . He had uncanny knowledge of the location of his veins , was suspiciously familiar with hospital routine . He tyrannized doctors and nurses , was described by a resident as " obese , obtuse , obstinate , obstreperous and obscene . " <P> Lamphere claimed to have been a professional wrestler billed as " the Indiana Cyclone , " also a ship 's carpenter and bosun 's mate . He told Munchausen stories about having had his appendix removed aboard a tugboat in Ireland , of exploratory kidney surgery in Japan . A crosshatch of surgical scars showed how often he had been under the knife . Disarmingly , <P> Lamphere signed an authorization for a request to a San Francisco hospital for data on his treatment there . He must have made a shrewd guess , for the answer did not arrive in time to help the harassed Iowa City doctors . Suspicious of his continual coughing or spitting of blood , the physicians tried every stratagem they could think of to catch him in deliberate self-injury . They never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital , complaining of inadequate care , stormed to the main door-and there was persuaded to return because he was again spitting blood .
