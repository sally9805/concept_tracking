Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TTMES : The excerpts from Senator Russell 's speech ' in The Times of July 3 can be presumed to represent the views of the " gently conservative " faction in the South . Senator Russell appears to believe that equal franchise exists throughout the South , but his exact wording belies this appearance . He remarks at least twice that there are already statutes to assure the right to vote , but he carefully Avoids any comments on the record of their enforcement . He asserts that the proposed bill will abolish the right of trial by jury , but he does not comment on the record of jury trials in the South on cases involving racial issues . These two phases of the situation are related , as all straight-thinking Congressmen ( and , I believe , Senator Russell ) know . With the occasional exceptions , there is in the Deep South no such thing as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro accused of a crime against a white person . Juries in such trials are made up of white men , few of whom will admit that a Negro is their equal . Thus Negroes are deprived of their constitutional right by deliberate selection of biased jurors . All-White Juries The other side of that coin is this : juries trying cases of white persons accused of crimes against colored are also all-white . Even when presented clear evidence of commitment of the foulest crimes , as in the recent beating and murder of a 14-year-old Negro by two white men , Southern white juries are unable to bring in a verdict of guilty . This is also the general status of enforcement of the equal-franchise laws in the South . Senator Russell ca n't help but know this situation , yet he speaks as if he does n't . It is a fact that , like the Senator , the majority of Deep Southerners are incapable of doing anything to bring Negroes up to full citizenship without some strong personal incentive . The only incentive the Congress can provide is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury-trial system of the South , which for ninety years has abandoned justice in racial-issue cases , is in itself a formidable set of teeth , as the Senator fears . Mr. Russell complains that the proposed legislation has been widely advertised as a " moderate bill to assure and protect the voting right of American citizens , " and that its true purpose of " enforcing a commingling of white and Negro children in the state-supported public schools of the South " has been " obscured . " On this basis he says he will seek a referendum . Objective of Legislation This complaint is sheer nonsense . If he had been reading the papers from states north and west of Kentucky he Would know that we up here all understand clearly that the main objective of civil rights legislation is to integrate the schools and improve the opportunity of Negroes for employment . The voting right ( which many citizens of all colors frequently neglect to exercise ) is strictly a minor issue . After all , there is only one ticket in the Deep South . By all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of the bill might bring home to Senator Russell and his kind that the majority of Americans want to see the intent of our Declaration of Independence carried out . Integration of the schools is the fastest , soundest and probably the only way to end mass racial prejudice . Not until such prejudice has been done away with will all our citizens enjoy the " unalienable right to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . " This is what our Founding Fathers wanted and this is what we want . The " enormous respect " in- which Senator Russell is held by his colleagues can not have been heightened by this speech . J. F. CARLEY . Huntington , N. Y. , July 5 , 1957 . Entry of Hungarians Urged To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Is the present serious danger to United States prestige in Europe unknown to the American people ? In October the spirit of the whole free world was awakened by the Hungarian revolt . Radio Free Europe , for which the United States is at least indirectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised a home and living to those who fled when all hope was gone . During the first months of the Hungarian exodus , the United States invited Hungarians to register for emigration . Thousands did so and , with implicit faith in America , registered for no other country . Now those who did not get early transport are told they can not be admitted unless they have husband , wife , parents or children already in the United States , or specialized qualifications . It is now too late to go to most other countries , many of which have taken all the Hungarians their economy will stand . Those that remain , a large number of whom were the last to.leave the fighting and their native land , can either return to a dubious fate in Hungary or wait indefinitely in refugee camps . Many of these people are still in their late teens and early twenties . They fought well . But their spirit may now be broken , not by Russian methods , but by the demoralizing uncertainty of refugee life . They are losing faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who received proportionately so many take a poor view of American temporizing . If the United States is to lead the Western World we should for our own sake and as a Christian country keep faith and reopen our doors . WILLIAM E. NORMAN . Wollersdorf , Austria , June 20 , 1957 . Situation in Cyprus British Criticized for Translation of Recent Leaflet To THE EDITOR OF THENew York TIMES : In reading a summary of the annual report on the situation in Cyprus , issued by the colonial government of the island , I reached the conclusion that oppression constitutes not only a major evil to its victims but also a threat to the mind and elementary intelligence of all those practicing it . The British Administration in Cyprus in its endeavor to =eat , both the Cyprian people and thelf liberation movement , E. 0 . K. A. , describes a leaflet issued by that movement as carrying " the mark of totalitarian methods " showing " to what lengths the terrorists were prepared to go in misleading young people . " That " mark of totalitarian methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document , by the following excerpt of the leaflet : " Cyprus commands and not the family . The Fatherland is more honest , more decent and more sacred than the father , the mother and all ancestors . " Now , even upon a quick reading of this easy translation prepared in Whitehall , one recognizes one of the most famous basic principles of Plato 's philosophy ( Crito , 51-A-12 ) . For the sake of linguistic accuracy , the exact translation of that Greek phrase , as given by Prof. Harold N. Fowler of Western Reserve University , in the Loeb Classical Library , is as follows : " Your country is more precious and more to be revered and is holier and in higher esteem among the gods and among men of understanding than your father and your mother and all your ancestors . " The fact that the British colonial services should have mistaken a part of Plato 's teaching for a " totalitarian " slogan is quite significant and needs no further comment . I am sure that the British themselves , among whom are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be shocked at the ignorance , and sad mentality of those entrusted with the administration and fate of a people faithful to its great moral and spiritual traditions and to Plato , who in the year 1957 is labeled a " totalitarian . " CHRISTIAN X. PALAM.AS , Ambassador , Permanent Representative of Greece to the United Nations . New York , June 28 , 1957 . For Improved Mail Service To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW 1 ORK TIMES : I must speak an emphatic word of disagreement with recent letters to your paper which suggested , or to some degree tolerated , the possibility that our post office curtail its services by ending Saturday mail delivery . I for one believe we should increase mail deliveries and services . Compared to mail service in most other countries , our service already is far behind . It seems to me that a country that can engage in foreign aid to figures in the billions , and a country that now subsidizes various business industries through favorable mail rates  --  give-away mail rates I might say  --  can and should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , to all citizens . I am one of those persons born at the beginning of the century that other recent correspondents in these columns have described as witnesses to a reduction in personal liberties which are supposedly the fundamental right of all of us . I believe we can begin immediately to demonstrate official respect for the citizenry by somehow bringing mail service up to the high standard found almost everywhere else in the world . I leave it to Congress to settle how first-class mail service shall be paid for , whether by a rise in postage rates or by liberal subsidy , but let 's not play favorites , penalizing first-class mail customers and providing near give-away service to businesses . And let 's not sell the private citizen down the river while taxing him to keep foreign countries with superior mail services solvent . NINA HOWELL STARR . ( Mrs. Nathan C. Starr ) Marlboro , N.
