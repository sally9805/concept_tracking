txt SEOUL , Korea , Nov. 2 ? A Kiisang girl , the equivalent of a Japanese geisha girl , died today with a love song on her lips as twentyseven convicted collaborators were executed in a hillside cemetery outside this city . Lee Chang Ho , a professional ' entertainer who had been mistress of the Seoul Communist police chief during the North Keoran occupation , was one of two women who faced a South Korean firing squad . The other woman was the 4Tyear-old wife of a Communist official , herself a district captain of the party 's woman 's organization . Death came to the twenty-seven on a sunny afternoon in a countryside bright with yellow and red foliage against the perennial evergreens and sheared brown rice fields .

The doomed received cigarettes after they had been tied to posts and blindfolded , and had paper targets placed over their hearts to direct the fire and shorten their agony . But other things about the execution bespoke brutality . The most callous example was the failure of all concerned to remove an eight-month-old child strapped to the Kiisang girl 's back in the customary oriental childcarrying manner before she was lifted , hands bound behind her , into the truck in the prison yard . Just before the trucks rolled out of the gate , an officer , almost as an afterthought , ordered the infant un27 ARE EXECUTED IN SEOUL CEMETERY // tied and returned to the prison At 2 P.

The 29-year-old Kiisang girl wept and asked what would become of her baby . The guards ignored her . Girl Volunteers in Convoy After the captives had been hoisted into trucks , the caravan rolled into the streets . Behind the trucks carrying the condemned and the executioners rode a jeep with representatives of a military court and a medical officer . The rear was brought up by a truck with ten members of the South Korean Woman 's Voluntary . Army Corps . These uniformed 17 to 20 year old girls were giggling and chewing gum . The procession halted in the middle of the city when a backboard fell off the lead truck and two members of the firing squad fell into the street . Leaving the highway near a burned-out Russian tank , the convoy lurched over rutted roads and halted beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill toward rows of old burial mounds . The captives were herded into a field and were made to squat until their names were called in order . Then they were rearranged into three rows of nine . The Kiisang girl resumed her wailing . The word " Aegi , " meaning baby , was repeated . As the young captain in charge strode before the huddled captives to read their death warrants the Kiisang girl , raised her hands , which had been tied in front of her after the baby had been taken from her back . She cried out in supplication . The captain leaned forward and said , ' " It is useless . This is your lot and there is nothing that can be done about it . " As , by magic the woman 's strained features relaxed . She sat back , raised her head and began singing . The words were those of a girl asking her lover to return . The first row , consisting of nine men , was ordered to its feet and led up the hill . Around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dug pit . A burial squad of a dozen civilians moved in closer . The ten young Korean women volunteers found vantage seats on the rocks . The only non-Korean witnesses were one French , one Australian and this reporter . Doomed Men Get Cigarettes The doomed men were tied against posts and cigarettes were placed in their mouths and lighted . They had not been blindfolded when fifteen riflemen took their posts on the incline a short distance below them and loaded their guns . The captain bit his lip and ordered the men blindfolded quickly . One captive called out : ' What sort of game are you playing ? " Another said : " My elder brother is secretary to the President . Call him before you shoot . " A volley rang out and three bodies broke their binding and fell into the pit . The others were tied so tightly to the posts that they remained ? upright even after a lieutenant had fired a coup de grace into the heads .

Struggling against soldiers who dragged her to a post , she tore off her blindfold six times and cried she must make a statement . The proceedings were delayed while a lieutenant wrote down her denial that she had given the names of anti-Communist neighbors and patrons to her police chief lover . She said she originally had come to Seoul from North Korea as a refugee from the Communist rule and insisted her accusers had been Communists . As she named the alleged Communists the lieutenant wrote down their names . The captain assured her that her infant would be placed in an orphanage . The blindfold was replaced and the girl who had lived by her graces and songs resumed her love chant as the rifles cracked .
