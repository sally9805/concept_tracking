The Honorable John Denzil Fox-Strangways , 42 , former Coldstream Guards officer and second son of the Earl of Ilchester , was relaxing in his St. James 's Street club , Brooks 's , one night last week . Fox-Strangways ' after-dinner calm was shattered by an indignant telephone call from another St. James 's Street club , White 's , of which he is also a member . <P> The Honorable Hugh Stanley , 24 , brother of the Earl of Derby , informed Fox-Strangways that Minister of Labor Aneurin Bevan , rabid Socialist and ex-coal-miner , was being entertained at White 's . Bevan 's host was Sir John Slessor , Air Chief Marshal , who had invited the minister in for a drink after a meeting on R.A.F. manpower problems . <P> Both White 's ( founded 1693 ) and Brooks 's ( founded 1764 ) are primarily social , nonpolitical clubs , but as the qualifications for membership are background , breeding and wealth , they are naturally Tory strongholds . Other Laborites enter Brooks 's and White 's without causing any commotion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech in 1948 he had blatantly proclaimed : " Tories are lower than vermin . " <P> Fox-Strangways strode angrily across St. James 's into White 's and , when Bevan and Sir John left the club shortly after , followed them outside . Fox-Strangways ' family motto is Faire sans dire-deeds without words . Silently , he landed a kick on Bevan 's broad backside . The minister stumbled down the last half-dozen steps , was hurried into his car by Sir John . The Air Marshal declared later that Bevan behaved with " great restraint and dignity . " <P> Next day Sir John complained to White 's committee , which apologized to Bevan . Then the club announced Fox-Strangways ' resignation . Said one well-born Briton : " I 'm afraid they 're awfully upset about it at White 's . I mean to say , you should never kick a guest . Might have kicked Slessor for taking the fellow there , though-damned odd thing to do . "                   @ @
