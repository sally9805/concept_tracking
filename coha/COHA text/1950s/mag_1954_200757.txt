The Tender Trap ( by Max Shulman and Robert Paul Smith ) is the usual trap set for bachelors-with the usual outcome . <P> Thirty-five-year-old Charlie Reader is not just the usual bachelor , however ; he is part of what the authors portray as a special Manhattan breed-men besieged in their own apartments by an endless stream of attractive , obliging , gift-bearing women who are also more than happy to cook or clean house for monsieur . In the face of such good fortune , Charlie ( well-played by Ronny Graham ) has not the slightest desire to marry . <P> To complicate matters , Charlie 's married pal from back home ( Robert Preston ) arrives in New York on business , and is pretty envious of Charlie 's lot , but even more disapproving . He so sprays the atmosphere with the idea of matrimony that Charlie becomes engaged to two girls at once ; a little later Boy loses Girls ; thereafter , the big question of the evening is which one will he regain . <P> The play gets some amusement out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bathes regularly and has a steady job can lead the life of Don Juan just by answering the doorbell . The play is also rather amusingly penetrated with the idea that to all married men and single women the bachelor state-quite irrespective of a bachelor 's habits-is thoroughly shocking . On the pleasant side , too , are more attractive girls-Kim Hunter , Janet Riley , Julia Meade and Parker McCormick-than turn up in many a musical . <P> But the play is unsatisfying ; it lacks the right touch and tone . Its setup calls for something cool , smooth , quietly disdainful ; far too often it is given something Broadwayish and breezy-stretches in which grown-men exchange banter about sex and a scene of disheveled , morning-after , mail-order farce . There is too palpable an air of We Aim To Please about it , and of aiming to please the very far from fussy . <P> Fragile Fox ( by Norman Brooks ) is a competent , routine thriller about World War II . It tells , in the italics of melodrama , of a company-commanded by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Battle of the Bulge . Loathed by his men , the captain gets by with his ambition-ridden colonel because he is the son of an influential political boss in the colonel 's home state . To the rumble of tanks and the rat-tat-tat of gunfire , the gutless captain wobbles , crosses up his men , plots to run out on the job , and is finally shot by his most levelheaded subordinate . <P> Fragile Fox bangs through three acts , tossing at the audience a large variety of theatrical explosives . Blood is shed , broken bones are set , orders are defied , prisoners are shot , characters swear and curse , reel forward and roll backward . The characters themselves range from the comic to the psychopathic , the believable to the incredible ; the incidents sometimes recall the war , rather oftener recall other war plays .
