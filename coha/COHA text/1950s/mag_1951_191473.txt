Among the highest and rarest medals for heroism in the nation 's gift are the Distinguished Service Cross ( for " extraordinary heroism . . . against an armed enemy " ) and the Silver Star ( for " gallantry in action " ) . But by last week the Cross and the Star were beginning to seem neither so high nor so rare . <P> In Korea , reporters totted up the awards bestowed by General Douglas MacArthur and the Air Force 's Lieut . General George Stratemeyer . Stratemeyer had awarded Silver Stars to seven of his back-in-Japan staff officers . One brigadier general got his for assuring the " constant and uninterrupted flow of material , " other staff generals for being " subject to enemy air and ground attack " during occasional flying trips to Korea . <P> Douglas MacArthur had been similarly generous . His surgeon general and his chief of intelligence got Silver Stars . At the Inchon landing , MacArthur approached the beach in a landing craft , but was persuaded to go no closer by the Seventh Fleet 's commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorated Struble with the Distinguished Service Cross , though Struble had done little more , heroically speaking , than stand on his bridge in a calm sea . Vice Admiral C. T. Joy , Far East naval commander , got one too . When MacArthur finally landed , he passed out Silver Stars to three Marine officers-and two South Korean naval officers who happened to be passing by . <P> MacArthur topped this off with another Cross to Stratemeyer for " continually subjecting himself to great danger " in directing the evacuation of U.S. civilians from advanced airfields . And Stratemeyer awarded MacArthur the Distinguished Flying Cross ( " for heroism or extraordinary achievement while participating in an aerial flight " ) , on the ground that MacArthur 's flying visits to Korea were made " under conditions presenting the threat of hostile air interception . " <P> Somehow , the flow of bright ribbons was still not trickling down to the enlisted ranks. * Near Waegwan a few months ago , a corporal named Everett L. Elmore headed his boat across the bullet-torn Naktong River for the enemy-held shore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against its sides . Corporal Elmore rallied his panic-stricken passengers , delivered them to the beachhead , and went back for more . On his last trip , Corporal Elmore was mortally hit . He got the Bronze Star Medal-posthumously-an award for " heroic achievement " not deemed to be of sufficient degree to merit a Distinguished Service Cross or a Silver Star . <P> <P> *Last week Army Secretary Frank Pace and Chief of Staff J. Lawton Collins pinned the first Korean campaign ribbons ( blue with white stripes ) on three wounded veterans in Washington 's Walter Reed hospital .
