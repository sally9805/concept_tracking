In the 14 months since Polish workers rose at Poznan crying for bread and freedom , the Poles have won half a loaf of freedom but very little bread . Out of their protests , Wladyslaw Gomulka rose to power , wrested control of the Polish Communist Party from the Stalinists , defied Moscow and won an election . But he inherited a mess : Poland was close to economic bankruptcy and moral anarchy . For all he tried to revive the Poles ' fierce national pride and to relax the grip of the police state , Communist Gomulka found no Red formula to solve the economic crisis . <P> " To be brief . " acknowledged a Warsaw radio commentator last week , " things are tough in Poland . " <P> And to be blunt , things are chaotic . Housing is miserable and overcrowded . Wages are so low ( average : $65 a month ) that many a Pole works overtime at two jobs , puts his wife and children to work , or steals what he can from the state-run enterprises , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and his stand against the hated Russians would be enough to inspire the Poles to work . <P> Vodka &; Freedom . But workers , no longer menaced by secret police , dreamed of a freedom of their own-the right to stay away from work . In the first half of 1957 , absenteeism has more than doubled , to 26 million man-hours lost . To drown their woes , they took to drink at an increasing rate ( 7.5 liters hard liquor per head per year-30% above 1956 ) . Gomulka warned the workers that he could not raise wages until they produced more ; the workers replied that they would not work harder without some real evidence of a better life . They began agitating for wage increases , and-though strikes are forbidden in Gomulka 's Workers ' State-even staged scattered strikes . <P> Women &; Tear Gas . In Lodz ( pronounced Woodge ) , 75 miles southwest of Warsaw , the early shift of streetcar workers reported for work one 3 a.m. last week , but no cars left the barns . Instead , before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sitdown strike , demanding that their 800-zlotys monthly pay ( enough to buy one pair of shoes ) be increased 50% . The militia fired tear gas and wielded clubs . A worried Gomulka dispatched a trade union chief , a vice-minister and a security general from Warsaw , called out the troops to keep order , pressed 750 trucks into action to provide transportation in Poland 's second largest city ( pop . 675,000 ) , and banned the sale of vodka to prevent " real trouble . " <P> When the vice-minister appealed to the sitdowners to end their strike , a woman in the audience held up a tear-gas canister and asked : " Is this what you use against women ? " The militia used tear gas again the second night , and after routing strikers from the car barns got the trolleys moving , with guards on each . The strike was over , broken not only by a show of force , but by the government 's promise to look into the strikers ' complaints .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
