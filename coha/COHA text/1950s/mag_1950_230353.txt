Complained a correspondent in Korea : " For a while it was enough to just get shot at to get a story . Now you 've got to get hit to have anything worth while . " <P> What he was talking about was the grim adventure last week of Frank Emery , 23 , International News Service Correspondent , and Randolph Churchill , 39 , of the London Daily Telegraph . After several days at " Sioggerville " ( correspondents ' slang for a dangerous sector ) , Emery and Churchill had gone to a quiet sector for a rest . There , a G.I. braced them : " You fellows always talk to the brass and never give us a break . Why do n't you come on patrol with us tonight and tell the people back home how tough it is ... There wo n't be any danger . We know this area . " <P> That night when the six-man patrol waded across the Naktong River , Correspondents Emery and Churchill were with it . Only for Emery was it an entirely new experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renowned for his flamboyant courage under fire . All went well for two hours , while they prowled around in the Communist lines . Then , as they started back , the Reds opened fire and three mortar shells exploded among them . Both Emery and Churchill were hit by shrapnel ; the G.I. between them was so badly wounded that he was abandoned . The patrol waded and crawled back to the U.N . lines . <P> Emery , hit in the side , thigh and foot , was suffering from shock . Nevertheless he managed to dictate a distraught account ( " It had been a physical and mental ordeal beyond my powers to describe " ) to Correspondent Frank Conniff of Hearst 's New York Journal-American , which splashed it across Page One-as did other Hearst papers . Churchill , who also got back under his own power , had a half-dollar-sized hole in his shin . But he calmly dictated a smooth , well-told story of the patrol to the Associated Press 's Hal Boyle , to be sent on to his paper . By his notable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of correspondents who had been offended by his toplofty manners . As he lay on a litter awaiting transportation to Japan , a G.I. asked him : " Are you really Winston Churchill 's son ? " Churchill eyed him coldly and snapped : " Well , I 'm certainly not one of Clem Attlee 's offspring . " <P> Lloyds of London last week totted up casualties among correspondents in Korea* ( eight killed , six wounded , two missing , one captured ) and decided the risks had outrun the rates which have been in effect since Dday , 1944 . It boosted the insurance premium from 5% to 10% for accidental death for newsmen in Korea . <P> <P> *Last week correspondents got an official shoulder patch with the initials " U.N . " and the words " war correspondent " in blue and silver , the U.N . colors.
