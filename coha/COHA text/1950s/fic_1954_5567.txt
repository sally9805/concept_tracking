At least a contributing factor to the current cycle of science fiction movies being made in Hollywood is the touchiness of minorities having their nationals being portrayed as villains . Cinema-makers are now trying to avoid further boycotts by using space aliens for villains . But suppose some of our Extraterrestrial neighbors are also a bit touchy ? reel life films by ... Jacques Jean Ferrat Pity the poor purveyor of mere entertainment in today 's world . He ca n't afford to offend a soul , yet must have a villain . Twenty-five years ago Cyril Bezdek and E. Carter Dorwin would have met in a private railway car belonging to one of them . They might even have met in a private train . At any rate they would have met in absolute privacy . But it being the present , they had to be content with a series of adjoining rooms taking up less than one half of a car on the Super-Sachem , fastest coast-to-coast train in the country . Their meeting in private was very important . Upon its results hinged the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production companies . Dorwin was the powerful plenipotentiary of the Consolidated Trust Company of Manhattan and backer of Gigantic 's multimillion-dollar productions . He was on his way West to make sure that the interests of his bank were being adequately served by the studio . Bezdek was Gigantic 's supreme production boss . Former office boy , writer , prop man , assistant-director , director , producer , and story editor , he was the works  --  unless Dorwin decided otherwise during this meeting and pulled the props out from under him . He had thought Dorwin 's trip sufficiently important to fly to Kansas City and get aboard the Super-Sachem to be with the banker during the remainder of his trip . They had dined in the privacy of Dorwin 's suite  --  Bezdek as befitted his tortured duodenum on yogurt and Melba toast  --  Dorwin on caviar , consomme , a thick steak with full trimmings , and a golden baked Alaska accompanied by Armagnac . " How do you manage to keep thin ? " Bezdek asked him , honestly envious . " Polo , tennis ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't exercised in ten years , " said the banker , biting off the end of a Havana Perfecto . He studied the little movie-maker over the flame of his lighter . Outside , the flat expanse of Kansas rushed past through the night at close to a hundred miles an hour . " Some people are lucky , " said Bezdek , adjusting the broad knot of his hand-painted Windsor tie . He was remarshaling his thoughts and ideas . It was very important that he and Dorwin be in perfect accord before they reached Hollywood . The banker , who was new to the movie-making branch of his business , spoke first . " I presume , " he said finally , " that you 're aware of the current feeling in our New York office ? " The movie magnate gestured carelessly with a Saxony gun-club sleeve , revealing a platinum wristwatch strap . " We hear rumors now and again , " he said . " It 's about our science fiction films . " Bezdek avoided making it a question . He was far too shrewd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disadvantage , said amicably , " It 's not that the fantasy series is n't making money , understand . " He paused , looking faintly distressed . " It 's just that , frankly , we feel they 're getting too far away from reality . Trips to Mars and Venus  --  strange creatures .... It 's not real  --  it 's not dignified . Frankly , we question whether an institution like ours can afford to be connected with anything so  --  so ephemeral . After all ... " He paused as sounds of a scuffle in the corridor penetrated the room and something or somebody was banged hard against the door . Bezdek , frowning , jumped up nervously and went to the door , opened it , looked out . " What 's going on out there ? " he inquired tartly . " Ty ! " " Sorry , Mr. Bezdek , " said Ty Falter , the mogul 's private secretary , bodyguard and constant companion . He was leaning against the far wall of the corridor , mopping a cut lower lip with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleepy-looking young man who virtually never slept . At the end of the corridor two lesser aides were half-dragging a tall figure between them . Bezdek frowned as he caught a glimpse of a nodding head in half profile  --  a near-perfect profile which showed no sign of a bruise . " How did that creep get in here ? " he snapped . " That 's the same character who tried to nail me at the K.C. airport . " " Yes , sir , " said Ty Falter apologetically . He glanced at his skinned knuckles . " It was like hitting a brick , " he said . He shook his head , added , " Sorry , Mr. Bezdek . I do n't know how he got in here . " " Your job is to keep crackpots like that away from me , " said the mogul . He turned and went back inside the compartment . Dorwin was still sitting as before . " Eavesdroppers ? " the banker inquired with unruffled poise . " Not likely , " said Bezdek , dropping into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a screen test . " * * * * * The incident had brought back his heartburn . He wanted to take a couple of his pills but not in front of Dorwin . The banker might think he was cracking up . These damned New Yorkers had no idea of the pressure under which he labored . He sipped a glass of flat soda water . " Where were we ? " Dorwin said quietly . Somehow to Bezdek he gave the impression of remorseless rationality . " Oh , yes , these fantasy movies  --  we 're a little worried about them . " " I thought you might be , " said Bezdek , leaning forward and using the full magnetism of his personality . Now that the issue was out in the open his discomfort was eased . " Actually we do n't think of our interplanetary cycle as fantasy , Dorwin . We think of them as forecasts of the future , as prophecy . " " They 're still a far cry from reality , or even the usual escapism , " said the banker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be years  --  perhaps decades  --  before we make any live contact with the other planets . Our national interests demand that we prevent atomic power from superseding older methods before investments have realized on their holdings to the fullest extent . And it is upon development of atomic power that space-flight hinges at present . " " Certainly I understand that  --  sound business , " said Bezdek with his one-sided smile . " I hope they wait for many years . " Dorwin looked faintly astonished . " From these pictures of yours I must confess I had derived a totally different impression of your theories , " he said slowly , flicking two inches of pale grey ash into the silver tray at his elbow . " Listen to me , " said the movie-maker , again leaning toward his vis-a-vis . " We 're making these pictures now because when the first man or men come back from other planets our science fiction cycle is finished . It will cease to be escape . We will then be faced with the reality of what they really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal different from the sort of thing we 're feeding them now . " " It 's a point I had n't considered , " said the banker , reaching for the brandy . He nodded to himself as he poured it , then looked up at Bezdek and asked , " But why this  --  space opera is the colloquial term , I believe ? Why not stick closer to real life ? " Bezdek sat back and the slanting smile creased his features again . " Minorities , " he said . " That 's why . Crackpot minorities object loudly at being portrayed in films they do n't like . We do n't want to tread on anybody 's toes  --  there 's trouble enough in the world as it is . People want villains . But unless we make our villains  --  even minor villains  --  people from nowhere we get boycotted somewhere by somebody . And that costs us money . " " Yes , of course , " said the banker , " but I fail to see  --  " " It 's simple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " People like conflict in their movies . If it 's a Western they want their heroes to fight Indians or Mexicans or rustlers . The Indians and Mexicans object to being the villains and they 've got big sympathetic followings . Okay , so we use rustlers or renegade white men and we still make Westerns  --  but not many . No plot variety . " He sipped more soda water . " It 's the same with everything else . Unless we 're in a war with a legitimate enemy to hate we ca n't use villains . It 's almost enough to make a man wish  --  " " Not with the H-bomb , Bezdek , " said Dorwin frigidly . " Of course not  --  I was only speaking figuratively , " said the movie-maker hastily . " I 'm as much against war as anyone . But that 's what makes these interplanetary movies great stuff . We can run in all the villains we want  --  make them just as bad as we want . Audiences really like to have someone they can hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He permitted himself to look faintly pleased . " After all , a Martian can hardly protest what we do with him . I see your point now . " " You 've got it , " said Bezdek , beaming now . He leaned forward and added , " Furthermore , we 've got four new pictures in the works for the space cycle that are really going to  --  " He broke off , interrupted by a knock at the door . He stared at the banker , seeking someone to share his annoyance , found Dorwin staring out the window , frowning . " The train seems to have stopped , " said the banker . Bezdek turned to the window . It was true . The night was clouded and dark but he could make out a single tree in faint silhouette and it was not moving . The knock on the stateroom door came again . " I 'd better see who it is , " said Bezdek , rising . " Maybe something is wrong . " He opened the door quickly  --  all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the too-perfect features  --  the man who had tried in vain to speak to him at the Kansas City airport , who had been forcibly evicted earlier from the car  --  stood there ! The young man smiled and it was much too cold to be ingratiating if that was its intent . He said , looking down on both men , " I think you will wish to talk to me now . " The sheer effrontery of it rendered Cyril Bezdek speechless for the first time in years . Looking past the intruder through the angle of the open door he could see Ty Falter sitting on the corridor floor , leaning against the wall . His eyes were closed , his head canted at an odd angle . It was Dorwin who first found words . " Who are you ? " he inquired . " What do you want ? " " I am from Mars , " said the stranger . " I have come here to enter a protest against the manner in which Mr. Bezdek 's motion pictures are portraying my people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it quickly , glanced across at the banker , saw equal bewilderment on that usually poker-face . On impulse , Bezdek reached for the buzzer that would summon aid and pressed it firmly several times . " No one will answer , " said the intruder in a voice remarkable not for its accent but for its lack of any . " We have been forced to  --  to immobilize this train in order to see you . It has been very difficult to reach you , Mr. Bezdek , I am sure through no fault of your own . But the people of my planet feel very strongly about this matter and I must get some satisfaction for them . " " So help me , " said the mogul , his thin face purple with anger , " if this is a gag I 'll see you jailed for it ! And before you 're jailed you 're going to have a very unpleas  --  " " No , Mr. Bezdek  --  Mr. Dorwin  --  this is not a joke . We of Mars are proud of our culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as evil and ridiculous creatures . We 're not like those filthy Venerians . We Martians have a great self-respect . " " Ostrich feathers ! " Bezdek roared at the dead-panned intruder . " You may not be aware of it but there are severe penalties for holding up a train on this  --  in this country . You ca n't go around slugging people either . Look at Ty out there . " " Your servant will be all right , " said the intruder , " as will the others aboard this train . I can release them whenever you agree that my mission is to be taken seriously . " " All right , " said Bezdek , whose mind was nothing if not acrobatic . " Suppose you are from Mars . Tell me why your people object to our movies . Surely they are n't seeing them on Mars ? " " No . But your Earthmen will reach our planet soon and your opinion of us will be shaped in some degree by these movies they have seen . And since the relationships of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must not be represented as other than we are . Such misconceptions could breed interplanetary war . " He shuddered . " I think you 're crazy ! " said Bezdek . He turned to the banker , who was again staring out the window . " There 's something out there  --  look , " said Dorwin . " That is our ship , " the intruder told them blandly . " That is why we stopped the train here . It is the only flat area sufficiently unsettled for our landing and departure without detection . We must return at once or lose perihelion . " " Let me see , " said Bezdek . He peered through the window . There was something out there  --  something black and vague and shaped like an immense turtle with jagged projections . He tried to tell himself he was seeing things , failed . " Amazing ! " said E. Carter Dorwin . " It 's utterly amazing ! " " Incredible is the word for it , " Bezdek said wearily . He faced the intruder , said bluntly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars . And I say to your face that you are n't ! " " You seem remarkably sure , Mr. Bezdek . " " And why not ? " The movie-maker was in his element now , delivering the clincher in an argument . " Our scientists have proved conclusively that Earthmen can not exist on Mars without space-suits . You say you 're a Martian . Yet you look like one of us . So if you can live on Mars , how can you live in our atmosphere without a space-suit of some sort ? There 's one for you to answer ! " He chortled . " But I am wearing protection  --  a protective suit arranged to give the impression that I am an Earthman . " A flicker of something akin to distaste passed over his singularly immobile face . " I 'd like to see what you do look like , " said Dorwin , suddenly entering into the eerie conversation . Something like a sigh escaped the intruder . Then he said , " Very well . It is important that you believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of his scalp and deliberately he peeled the life-like mask slowly from the hidden features of his thoroughly Martian face ! It was a very odd face  --  not at all human . It reminded Bezdek a little of an immutably sad Bassett Hound he kept in his Hollywood kennel . It made Dorwin think of his mother-in-law . It was not a frightening face and the single eye in the center of the forehead held them with its mournful regard , held them , held them ... When they were thoroughly under its hypnotic spell the Martian began to speak softly ... * * * * * Ty Falter was slow in waking up . But when he realized that he was lying there in the corridor he came to with a start . If Bezdek ever found out about this he 'd be cooked as far as Hollywood went ! He got to his feet , his unsteadiness helped not at all by the fact that the train chose that moment to start with a jerk . He grabbed at the wall as a meteor flashed through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thought , the damned thing was going up , not down . But he forgot about the meteor as he heard the voices coming from the stateroom he was being paid to guard . He reeled over to the partly opened door and listened . Bezdek was talking volubly , enthusiastically as he did when he spoke of the actual making of a picture . " ... so we 'll only have to reshoot a few sequences , Dorwin . The cost will be nothing compared to the returns . Think of it ! Our space-pilot hero crashes on Venus . He has to fight horrible slimy swamp creatures  --  we can make them look like crocodiles with six or eight legs  --  to reach the mountaintop where the girl is hiding ... " He paused and Dorwin said gravely , " I 'm glad , since these space operas seem to be necessary , that you have decided to locate them on a real planet like Venus rather than a fictitious one like Mars . If minority pressure groups force us to use fantasy then it is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right , Dorwin ! Right on the nose ! " cried Bezdek . " And we can make real villains out of these Venerians , real bang-up nasty heavies ! " The banker 's voice came through the door again . He said doubtfully , " But how can we be sure about the Venerians ... " " Because I can feel it here ! " cried the movie-maker . The thump that accompanied his final word told Ty that his boss had smote himself dramatically over the heart as he delivered the climactic line .
