The Defense Department 's new security information order , which newsmen predicted would create a brownout of news from the Pentagon , last week produced a byproduct they did not expect . In Washington , Illinois Democratic Congressman William Dawson announced that his Government Operations Committee is launching an investigation to find out whether the Administration is withholding " pertinent and timely information from the press . " A special subcommittee plans to question everyone from Syndicated Columnist Drew Pearson to the Washington Post and Times Herald 's Managing Editor J. Russell Wiggins , chairman of the Freedom of Information Committee of the American Society of Newspaper Editors . <P> Ever since Defense Secretary Charlie Wilson decreed that news put out by or extracted from the Pentagon must be " constructive " ( TIME , April 18 ) , newsmen have been worried . Such a policy is just the thing for Government officials who want to cover up their own mistakes by withholding " nonconstructive " news . In practice , reporters got less and less news at the Pentagon . When Wilson named R. ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information chief , newsmen were even more concerned . He had never been a newsman , and what press experience he had gained was as Director of Publication for the Bell Telephone Laboratories . His only recent Government experience was as a censor for the Department of Commerce . By last week , newsmen 's complaints about Honaman and the news brownout at the Pentagon prompted the congressional probe . <P> Check List . Most of the furor centered around Honaman 's definition of " constructive " news . Said Honaman : " There are . . . many cases where demands for information which take up the time of people with busy schedules do not truly meet the requirements of being useful or valuable , nor yet very interesting to the public . " The A.S.N.E. 's Wiggins promptly pointed out that Honaman 's definition meant that he-and not newsmen-would decide what the public is likely to be interested in . <P> Last week reporters turned up another source of complaint . They discovered that Army field commands had received " balance sheets for strategic information " prepared under Honaman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers could check off answers to a series of questions that would supposedly help them decide whether information requested by reporters would be " helpful " or " harmful " to U.S. interests , e.g. , " Does the information have much/little helpful/ harmful effect on world opinion ? " Taken literally , said one of the officers who received the form , the check list would make him turn down virtually all reporters ' requests for information . Under fire for the check list and his fuzzy policies , Honaman got himself into even hotter water with the press by suggesting that editors should voluntarily refrain from publishing any information that they thought might be helpful to the Russians , even if it was not classified .
