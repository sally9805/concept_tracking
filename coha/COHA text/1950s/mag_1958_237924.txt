Of all women 's clothes , the bathing suit has worn best through the ups and downs of high fashion ; 1947 brought the Bikini , and no one has quite been able to top that . But last week , as it has come to dresses , coats , suits and negligees , the chemise came to bathing suits . <P> Almost every top bathing-suit designer has an entry in the new line ( see cuts ) . Cole of California , which grew fast on suits to let in the sun , is adding two chemise bathing suits that keep it out as effectively as any Gay Nineties rig . Designer Rose Marie Reid is putting a complete collection of voluminous prints and stripes with " stay-down legs " and tummy-hiding overblouses into 4,800 U.S. stores ; Manhattan 's Margaret Pennington , who specializes in hand-loomed suits , is selling 500 chemise swim suits monthly to such high-fashion stores as California 's I. Magnin and Manhattan 's Bonwit Teller . <P> No one expects the chemise to take over completely . But it may well prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to conceal , rather than reveal , on the beach-and a bore to the men who have to look at it .
