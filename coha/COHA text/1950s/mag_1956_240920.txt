Of all human diseases , few produce more fantastic results than a cystic tumor of the ovary : as it fills with fluid , such a tumor may grow to monstrous proportions . The archives are inconclusive as to the biggest tumor ever recorded , but last week Dr. Dan H. Eames Jr . of La Marque , Texas achieved an unquestioned record of the size of a tumor removed intact : 184 lbs . <P> <P> The patient , a 42-year-old woman , had trouble squeezing through the doors of Surgeon Eames 's clinic . Dr. Eames faced a hard decision . One school of surgeons holds that it is too dangerous to remove a big tumor intact because this may throw the patient into shock ; another holds that it is more dangerous to drain the tumor first and then remove the husk , because fluid containing malignant cells may spill into the abdominal cavity . Surgeon Eames decided to run the risk of shock , try to get the tumor out unbroken and undrained . <P> <P> Easier said than done . His first 3-ft. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had to make a T-shaped incision and fold back huge flaps of abdominal wall . Then he was able to roll out the tumor-a purplish , egg-shaped mass almost 3 ft. long . The patient 's circulation faltered only for a moment when she was rolled onto her back . Now , Dr. Eames told the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists , she is back in the fields as a migrant harvest hand .
