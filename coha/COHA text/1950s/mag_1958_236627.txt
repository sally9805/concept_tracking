Back from a 32,000-mile , six-week swing through the farthest reaches of the Commonwealth , Harold Macmillan felt a " sense of exhilaration and renewed faith " in the strength of Britain 's empire ties . The Commonwealth had seen an unexpectedly relaxed and genial Macmillan . Fresh from a rousing reception in India , he landed at Karachi in Pakistan ( in a Britannia turboprop airliner nicknamed " The Flying No. 10 " ) to be greeted by cheering thousands , detoured 700 miles north to the North-West Frontier mountains never before visited by a British Prime Minister . <P> At Khyber Pass tribal leaders draped garlands around Macmillan 's neck , gave him the traditional Pathan tribesman 's greeting : " Welcome ; come in peace . " In Ceylon , which has been busily ejecting Britain from its old military bases , even Macmillan was amazed at the warmth of his welcome from crowds that lined the streets as he passed . Between speeches in Australia , the visitor shed his necktie and distributed the steaks in person at a Queensland sheep-station barbecue . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with policemen , housewives , schoolchildren and members of his honor guard . " A triumph , " cried London 's Spectator . " He is not known to have put a foot wrong , to have hurt any feelings , or to have dropped any bricks . " The Economist spoke admiringly of " the new , uninhibited Macmillan . " <P> Shock at Home . But Harold Macmillan stepped off the plane at London Airport to face jolting news . For weeks the country had been watching the Lancashire textile center of Rochdale , where a crucial by-election campaign was being waged to fill the seat left vacant by the death of Tory M.P . Lieut . Colonel Wentworth Schofield . Contesting the seat again for Labor was 47-year-old Jack McCann , a local diesel-engine fitter , who was handily defeated by Schofield in the last general election . A sturdy , 41-year-old real-estate agent from nearby Burnley named John Parkinson was to hold Rochdale for the Tories . The unexpected element in the race : Britain 's long-dormant Liberals , who decided to enter the lists with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 38 , Eton and Oxford , lecturer on current affairs and latterly a widely known television commentator . Kennedy cut a wide swathe through Rochdale , helped mightily by a glamorous fellow campaigner , his ballerina wife Moira Shearer . <P> When the votes were counted , Labor 's McCann , with 22,133 votes , had won , and , to the nation 's astonishment , the Liberals ' Kennedy had swept into No. 2 place with 17,603 votes , leaving Tory Parkinson a bad third with a paltry 9,827 . Never in living memory had a government candidate been so humiliatingly battered to the bottom of the poll . <P> In the House of Commons next day , Laborites greeted the government with shouts : " Resign ! Resign ! " Opposition Leader Hugh Gaitskell taunted : " In view of the catastrophe which has overtaken the party opposite , and the decline in the Conservative vote from over 50% to under 20% of the electors , does not the right honorable gentleman think it desirable that the business for next week should be scrapped and Parliament dissolved immediately ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
