The great U.S. housing boom , which the experts have prematurely buried at regular intervals since World War II , was still setting new records . Housing starts in August , reported the Bureau of Labor Statistics , totaled 111,000 , up 19% from a year ago . In Dallas the pace was so fast that there was a shortage of such supplies as wallboard , cement and plumbing equipment . In Levittown , Pa. , where Mass Builder William J. Levitt showed off a new three-bedroom , two-living-room house ( with garage ) for $10,990 , some 30,000 people stood in line to inspect it . In one week Levitt wrote orders for more than 375 houses , representing about $4,200,000 worth of new construction . <P> Auto Supply Down . Behind the new housing surge lay plentiful mortgage money , plenty of money in the bank ( savings last month hit a new high of $25.5 billion ) , and that vital factor that no economist can assess , the willingness to buy . In the first half of 1954 , said the Commerce Department , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of $233 billion . The outlook for the rest of the construction industry also seemed bright . The Associated General Contractors of America polled its members ( 80% of the industry ) and noted that building outlays of all types this year should hit $36.5 billion , up $17 billion from 1953 . <P> In another vital industry , things looked much brighter than they did only a few short weeks ago . Auto dealers reported that their stocks of new cars were down to 402,000 , about 11% below a month ago , and the lowest level in more than a year and a half . Last year at this time a wave of " blitz " selling swept the auto industry as dealers frantically tried to clear out their 1953 stocks . This year no blitz selling has yet appeared . To get ready for the tough competition ahead , Studebaker cut prices on its 1955 models by $37 to $287 . <P> Market Up . With all the bullish news , it was small wonder that the stock market continued its spectacular advance . Last week , following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $89 a share ) and Standard Oil of Indiana ( up $12 to $95 ) , the Dow-Jones industrial average climbed six points , for a fortnight 's gain of 13 . At 316.67 , it was only 20 points below the alltime high of 381.17 in September 1929.
