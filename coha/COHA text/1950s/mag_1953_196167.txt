Miguel de Unamuno , a brilliant man with flashing eyes who wrote novels , plays and poems , was long considered , with Ortega y Gasset , Spain 's most influential philosopher . In 1901 he became rector of the nation 's oldest university , and under him , Salamanca began to recapture some of the glory it had known in the days of Students Cervantes , Cortes and Ignatius of Loyola . This year , when Salamanca began laying plans to celebrate its 700th anniversary , it naturally included a solemn tribute to its great rector . <P> Deserve to Be Immortal . In his 72 years of life ( he died in 1936 ) , Miguel de Unamuno was forever in trouble . A fiery liberal , he was once exiled by Primo de Rivera , accused Alfonso XIII of being " unfit " to govern , attacked the republic and the rebels in turn , was finally dismissed by Franco . Though passionately religious , he could find no proof in logic for the immortality of the soul , felt that the only thing man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you deserve to be immortal . " To some segments of official Spain , Unamuno was a heretic . <P> Last week , just before Salamanca 's celebration was to begin , a pamphlet appeared in the streets called " Miguel de Unamuno : Greatest Heretic and Teacher of Heresy ! " Among other things , it quoted Antonio Pildin y Zapiin , Bishop of the Canary Islands , who attacked the philosopher as an " enemy of the religious faith common to all Spaniards . " It also quoted a 1942 decree in which the then Bishop of Salamanca listed the books of Unamuno that were on the Index . In a sudden panic , the university changed the name of the Unamuno house , which was to be opened as a museum , to the Casa Rectoral . It canceled plans to visit Unamuno 's grave , rescinded invitations to his relatives , barred the mention of his name in the program . Then university officials sat back to await the arrival of visitors . <P> Live Forever . The visitors came from universities all over the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Padua 's ermine , the Sorbonne 's yellow , white tie and tails from Harvard and Princeton . In the face of such a gathering , Salamanca should have been pleased-except for the irrepressible ghost of Miguel de Unamuno . <P> The visitors seemed determined to pay him tribute . They queued up hour after hour to visit his house , decked his bust with flowers , trudged through rain and mud to place wreaths on his tomb . Finally they gathered in the great Ceremonial Hall , and as each one rose to congratulate the university , the forbidden name seemed to pop up , again and again and again . At the end of the ceremony , Rector Pedro Lain Entralgo of the University of Madrid launched into an impassioned eulogy of " one of the Spanish masters who will live forever , long after many generations have died . " <P> The Bishop of Salamanca frowned and lowered his head . But the cheers burst out , and for long moments applause thundered through the hall . Don Miguel had had his day , after all .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
