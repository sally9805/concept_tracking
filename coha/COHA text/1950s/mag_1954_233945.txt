With the Republic of Ireland , if it is n't one thing , it 's bound to be another . For two years the Irish of Eire were miffed because Australia 's government was represented in Dublin by a mere charge d'affaires , while Eire had a full-fledged ambassador in Canberra . Last April Australia ( 20% of whose population is of Irish descent ) did its best to make amends , appointed a mystery writer named Dominic Paul McGuire as Ambassador to Eire . He got as far as London , but no farther . Miffed all over again , the Irish had turned McGuire down cold . Why ? Well , as the <P> Irish see it , Eire is the Gaelic name for Ireland , and while the Irish like to talk Gaelic among themselves , they do n't like foreigners talking it . When a foreigner says " Eire " instead of " Ireland , " he seems to be talking about the Republic of Ireland alone and deliberately excluding Northern Ireland , which does not mind talking English . The Republic of Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that it is not also the government of Northern Ireland . Make McGuire " Ambassador to Ireland , " said Dublin to Canberra , and all would be well . <P> No , sir , replied Canberra , because that might imply Australian recognition of Eire 's claim to Northern Ireland , and with the Queen herself due for a visit to Canberra , that would never do . How , suggested the Australian government , about " Ambassador to the Republic of Ireland , " or even " Ambassador to President Sean T. O'Ceallaigh , " just as the British themselves do it , spelling O'Kelly in the Gaelic way ? No , said Dublin firmly , it would have to be " Ireland " or nothing . <P> Last week , after nine months of diplomatic haggling , Australia abandoned all attempts to send an ambassador to Dublin . It did seem a shame , admitted one Irishman , with the man 's name McGuire and all .
