" For a woman , " says an old Hindu maxim , " there is no god on earth other than her man . " The most extreme form of this belief was the custom dictating that the widow fling herself on her husband 's funeral pyre . Enlightened British rule put a legal end to the practice of suttee ( widow suicide ) , but the widow 's lot has remained a poor one . Under Hindu laws , widows are not permitted to wear jewelry , bright clothing , makeup . They can not attend wedding or birthday celebrations . Under strict laws of inheritance dating back 3,000 years , a Hindu 's property is strictly entailed , passing from father to son over the generations and bypassing the women entirely . If a Hindu widow 's son or grandson proves ungenerous , she has no recourse but to beg on the streets . In the rare case when a man willed to his widow some small piece of private , uninherited property , she was allowed to spend it only for " legal necessities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband . <P> In 1937 the Hindus themselves passed a law permitting a widow to live on in her late husband 's house , though not to sell it . In 1949 Prime Minister Nehru sponsored a bill calling for vast and sweeping reforms of the whole Hindu social code , but the bill was too sweeping to get by . Since then Nehru has been picking away at his reforms piecemeal . Last year he eased the lot of India 's wives in a reformed marriage act . Last week he introduced a Hindu inheritance act designed to give wives , widows and daughters the right to inherit family property and to dispose of it in any way they like . <P> The new bill , cried Hindu diehards , marks " the end of India 's family system and the beginning of female rule , " to which , from his seat , Nehru harrumphed : " Thinking fit for an anthropological museum . " Smiling broadly at the 20 women M.P.s in India 's lower House of the People , Nehru declared , " The new womanhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petty faults and superficialities , is something which gives me hope for the future . I believe that if any great advances are coming to India , they will come largely through the women of India . " <P> After 40 hours of bitter debate , the new bill passed the House unanimously . " What we now have . " said Nehru 's own parliamentary secretary , Mrs. Lakshmi N. Menon , speaking as a woman , " is a possibility of freedom . "
