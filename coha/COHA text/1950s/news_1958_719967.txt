txt Gov . Orval E. Faubus declared tonight that a private school system appeared " to be the only answer to the Federal Government 's order to integrate at any price . " In a state-wide television address Governor Faubus called on the Little Rock School Board to r , " demonstrate good faith " by offering to lease the four high schools here to a newly formed corporation , which would operate them on a private basis . However , Mrs. L. C. Bates , president of the Arkansas branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , said : " When the schools open , be it under public or private guidance , Negro children will be there . " Meanwhile , plans were Made for the start of educational television Monday on all three Little Rock channels . Six hours of lessons a day will be available to the 3,480 students affected by the Governor 's refusal to allow the four schools to open . The Governor also expressed confidence that the outcome of the referendum Sept. 27 would be against reopening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , it is crystal clear that if the voters of the Little Rock School District vote against integration , these facilities will become surplus and not needed for public school purposes , " the Governor said . " This will leave the school board free to lease the buildings to a suitable private agency . In this connection . I am sure that you are already aware that such an agency has been organized . It was the Governor 's second appearance of the day on television . In an interview on the National Broadcasting Cornpalry network early this morning , he contended that Arkansas was not defying the Supreme Court by resisting the desegregation ruling handed down last Friday . Meanwhile , the newly elected , president of the Little Rock Private School Corporation , Dr. T. J. Raney , a 48-year-old surgeon , said the schools could re- , tain their accreditation under ' the groups ' plan . He also declared that he would be willing to go to jail , if necessary , to carry out the program . In his speech . Mr. Faubus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any price are still among us . " He went on : " They have seized upon the present situation to promote and foment concern and discontent , because of the temporary closing of the schools . They have spread wild rumors and attempted to organize demonstrations . These are the same people and the same forces who have all along been opposed to the majority will of the people of Little Rock and Arkansas . The only difference at the moment is that they have substituted the cry ' Open the schools , ' for the well-worn ' law and order ' phrase . " He said that boys and girls were being urged to " demonstrate and to issue statements which the adult instigators themselves do not have the courage to do . " The Governor- praised those " who seek to preserve our form of government . " But he attacked persons " who oppose the great majority of Arkansas people in this fight . " To them he said : " I urge you to thihk  --  lest in your consuming desire to gain your end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy also the very prin-1 ciples of government that enable you and all others to live as a free people . " He declared that Arkansans were unwilling to pay the price of " violence " to integrate the schools . The private school plan , he said , was within the law be-cause : ' l " The Federal Government has no authority to require any state to operate public schools . " g " The Federal Government has no authority to tell a state Government for what purposes it may levy taxes , or how the tax money may be expended . " c " In all the cases involving the public schools , and integration , the Federal courts have said only that an aghncy of the state can not maintain segre-1 gated schools . This ruling does not apply in any way to private schools . Private schools are not affected by these decisions , even though the schools receive aid from state and Federal sources .
