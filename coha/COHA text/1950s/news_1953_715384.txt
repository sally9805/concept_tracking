txt DEWEY FILLS 2 JOBS ON TRANSIT AGENCY ; CITY WEIGHS CHOICE H. K. Norton , Rail Trustee , and Maj. Gen. N. J. Casey Appointed to Authority MAYOR TO ACT TOMORROW 25 Names Are on List Hg Is Studying  --  Task of Finding Right Men Termed Hard By PAUL CROWELL Governor Dewey announced yesterday at Albany the appointment of two members of the fiveman New York City tk-ansit au-1 thority set up by the 1953 Legislature to take over the city 's subway , bus and street car lines and run them at a fare sufficient to cover all , operating costs . The men named by Mr. Dewey to the unsalaried posts were Henry K. Norton , trustee of the New York , Susquehanna and Western Railroad since 1943 , and Maj. Gen. Hugh J. Casey. retired Army engineer , who is executive vice president of Melrose Distillers , Inc . Both men live in Manhattan . The law setting up the new transit agency required Mr. Dewey to name two members of the authority by tomorrow and Mayor Impellitteri to appoint two by the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dewey appointments , said that he would make his own selections public some time tomorrow . The fifth member is to be chos- , en by the first four appointees not later than May 1 , but if they fail to agree the post goes to Howard ) S. Cullman , chairman of the Port of New York Authority , provided he accepts and qualifies . If he declines the job the fifth man is to be chosen by the New York members of the bi-state agency . Like the four first appointed , he must be a resident of the city . 25 Nettles on Mayor 's List The Mayor was considering over the weekend a list of about twenty-five names from which he could pick his two appointees . Some of those on the list have applied for the unsalaried positions , but most of them have been recommended by business and civic groups and members of the Mayor 's official family . It is no secret at City Hail that the Mayor has had difficulty in finding men of outstanding ability and reputation to serve on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision for the five places on its board even , if the city fails to act . If the Mayor should make no appoint , ments by tomorrow the Board of Estimate must designate two members by May 1 . If it fails to do so the chairman of the Port Authority will become the third member and he and the two ternhers named by Governor Dewey will name the two remaining members . It is possible , therefore , that the entire board may become , in effect , a body of which the state has complete control . Mr. Norton and General Casey , by virtue of their appointment . will be entitled , as soon as they are sworn in , to have access to all documents and records of the Board of Transportation so as to begin " an immediate study of the operations , finances and revenues of the transit facilities of the city . " The law requires the Board of Transportation and all its staff to cooperate in such a study . Although the Board of Estimate // has informally voted acceptance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the city will not be bound to turn over its properties to the new agency unless the board and the agency members reach by June 1 an agreement covering the transfer of the city 's $1,700,000,000 of transit facilities to the new authority . Although the Mayor prepared his 1953-54 executive budget of $1,528,812,975 on the assumption that the city 's transit lines would pass to the transit authority , the city is contesting in the Supreme Court the constitutionality of the law creating the new agency as ' well as that of statutes giving the city additional real estate taxing power of $50,000,000 and the power to levy a $60,000,000 payroll tax : Both statutes , by their terms , lapse unless the city turns its transit lines over to the new agency by July 1 . Supreme Court Justice Benjamin F. Schreiber , who heard arguments in the case last week , is expected to hand down a decision early this week . If the Board of Estimate fails to approve by June 1 an agreement for transfer of the city lines to the authority it will forfeit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes in 1953-54 , thereby throwing the Mayor 's executive budget $97,000 , - 000 out of balance . Other complications affecting the balancing of the Mayor 's budget may result from the decision to be handed down by Justice Schreiber , which will , however , be taken to the Court of Appeals for a speedy review , whether the city or the state wins in the lower court . ? In announcing his appointments to the new transit agency , Governor Dewey said that he was sure that " the public will share my gratitude to these two distinguished citizens who have agreed to undertake this public service , at great personal sacrifice and with no compensation , to improve the transit system and bring financial stability to the city . " Terms to Run for 6 Years All appointments to the authority are for concurrent six-year terms , starting as of last April 1 . General Casey and Mr. Norton have not yet been sworn in and no date has yet been fixed for that ceremony . General Casey said that he Would devote every possible moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed confidence that it would receive cooperation from the city , If and when it began to function .
