To Washington this week as guests of the Navy will fly a planeload of businessmen and scientists to inspect a new system being used by the Navy to speed production of new weapons . The system , called Program Evaluation and Review Technique ( PERT ) was set up to schedule and keep under continuous review the progress of the Polaris missile program , an administrative task rivaling the Manhattan Project in complexity . Thanks largely to PERT , the Polaris missile is programed to be operational in late 1960 , two years ahead of schedule . <P> PERT is the baby of the world 's largest ( 1958 billings : $11 million ) , most prestigious management consultant firm , Chicago 's Booz , Allen &; Hamilton . When the Navy realized that the thousands of steps involved in development of the Polaris called for an overall plan to spot trouble before it happened , it called in B. A. &; H. <P> <P> With the project separated into 44 main components and thousands of subparts , the consultants got the estimates of scientists and technicians on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a computer , got back success-probability curves . If the machine said a certain component had only a 10% chance of being ready on time , the Navy knew it had to put more money and men behind it or find a different way to do the job . In such cases the Navy could consult the computer to find out which of a score or more shortcuts around the obstacle was the best . <P> The Big Questions . Behind the experts that devised PERT lies 45 years of Booz , Allen &; Hamilton experience in counseling more than 2,000 U.S. firms in management problems-getting the right outside man to become president of a slipping company , improving the flow of executive information , revising an outdated product line , amicably easing out executive deadwood . The firm was founded by the late Edwin Booz , a Reading ( Pa. ) ironmonger 's son who studied economics and applied psychology at Northwestern University while serving as an Evanston night cop . At the time , efficiency experts were entranced with time-motion studies on how to do such things as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinct was to concentrate on the big questions involving basic company strategy , new products , sales ideas . His first big break came in 1925 , when Sewell Avery hired his firm , then in a one-room back office , to help streamline U.S. Gypsum . This led to a larger commission from Avery on how to reorganize Montgomery Ward during the Depression . In 1935 , the firm 's marketing-research side was strengthened by adding Partner Carl Hamilton . <P> The company 's fees were about $1,800,000 a year when Booz retired in 1946 and Hamilton died . The job of coordinating , i.e. , managing , partner fell to James L. Allen , then 41 , a scholarly Kentuckian with a steel-trap mind for remembering facts and a punch-card sorting machine 's ability to organize them . Holding that management analysts should continuously analyze themselves , Allen set up a think department to do nothing but figure out new services the firm could offer to an ever widening circle of clients . <P>                @ @ @ @ @
