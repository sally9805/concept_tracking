Ever since Astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered in 1928 that the great galaxies , thinly scattered through space , are fleeing from one another , scientists have tried to explain the expanding universe , or to explain it away . The most consistent theories postulate some strange , long-range force that operates only at enormous distances , pushing the galaxies apart in spite of the attraction of gravitation . But no one has measured this force or given a good reason why it should exist . <P> Last week cosmologists were arguing a new theory , originated by Mathematical Physicist Raymond A. Lyttleton of Cambridge University and elaborated with the help of Mathematician Hermann Bondi of the University of London . <P> Two Parts in 1 Billion Billion . Lyttleton and Bondi belong to the British school of cosmology , which holds that matter is being created continuously in the form of hydrogen atoms appearing in empty space . Each hydrogen atom consists of one electron and one proton , and physicists have generally assumed that the positive electrical charge of the proton is exactly equal to the negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this is only an assumption . <P> What will follow , they ask , if the charges differ by an infinitesimal amount , too small to measure with today 's best laboratory instruments ? One result , they answer , will be the expansion of the universe . If the difference is only two parts in 1 billion billion , the galaxies will be forced to flee from one another . <P> In a 33-page paper , Lyttleton and Bondi suggest that it is the protons that have the bigger charges . In a " smoothed-out " universe of newly created hydrogen , the atoms will all be slightly positive , and they will repel one another by electrostatic force , as all objects do when they have the same kind of electric charge . Thus the smoothed-out universe of hydrogen must expand as fast as it is created . <P> Peaceful Condensation . The real universe is not a smoothed-out gas . It contains condensations : galaxies and clusters of galaxies , each made of billions of stars and surrounded by clouds of gas . Inside these units , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead , some of the hydrogen atoms between the stars are ionized ( i.e. , separated into a proton and an electron ) by light and other radiation . These ions form a kind of electrical conductor : free protons move to the outside of the unit until they have carried away enough positive electricity to make the interior electrically neutral . <P> In the peaceful depths of the unit , ordinary gravitation prevails . Stars are born , grow old , and die , and planets revolve around them . But the galactic units themselves must flee from one another . They were formed out of matter that was fleeing , and they must continue to flee . They are like jigsaw puzzles put together on a moving train . They must move in the same way that their unassembled pieces were moving . <P> Lyttleton and Bondi believe that cosmic rays are the protons that were expelled from galactic units to make their interiors electrostatically neutral . Those expelled from big units have the highest energy , perhaps many billion billion volts . They cross intergalactic space at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bothered much by the thin hydrogen gas between the units ; they can travel through it for trillions of years without encountering anything that will check their progress .
