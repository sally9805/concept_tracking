Give me your tired , your poor . <P> Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free , <P> The wretched refuse of your teeming shore , <P> Send these , the homeless , tempest-tossed , to me : <P> I lift my lamp beside the golden door . <P> - Emma Lazarus ' inscription for the Statue of Liberty <P> That torch held by the chatelaine of Bedloe 's Island is now used to examine the family trees of would-be immigrants . Since 1924 , entry to the U.S. has been strictly rationed under the principle of national origins . Last week in the Senate , it was made clear that Congress intends to keep it thus . <P> This principle , which still guides U.S. immigration policy , takes the 94 million U.S. white population of 1920 , breaks it down into percentages according to foreign ancestry , and applies the percentages ' to determine how many immigrants may enter from each country . The result , as intended , heavily favors North Europeans , drastically holds down entry of South and East Europeans . Example : out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , * 41.4% may come from Britain and Northern Ireland , 11.2% from Ireland , only 3% from Italy , 2% from Greece . <P> Last week the principle of national origins came under heavy fire from Senate liberals . Up for debate and disposition was an omnibus immigration measure sponsored by Nevada 's Pat McCarran . In essence , the bill proposes no real departure in policy . Product of almost three years of study and hearings by the judiciary committees , it is designed to bring thousands of piecemeal immigration statutes and regulations ( accumulated since 1798 ) into one handy , compact code . In the process , it would remove some glaring inequities , e.g. , all Asiatic immigrants would be eligible for citizenship , where previously Japanese and certain others were barred . But the McCarran bill accepts the principle of national origin without any reservation . <P> Cry for Equality .

" Pastore passionately urged : " We should take the roster of the American Army in World War II . . . and , upon the basis of those racial strains , judge our immigration law . . . " <P> Main changes demanded by the protestors : <P> Pooling of unused quotas ; the McCarran bill keeps the old system under which unused quotas can not be transferred to countries whose quotas are exhausted . Updating of population base , from 1920 to 1950 , for determining quotas . Provisions to allow Orientals who are naturalized citizens of Western nations ( e.g. , Hong Kong Chinese ) to immigrate under the quotas of their Western nationalities ; the McCarran bill puts all Orientals , regardless of citizenship , in the small quotas assigned to their ancestral countries .
