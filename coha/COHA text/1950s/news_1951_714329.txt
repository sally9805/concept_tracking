txt A Wholesale lot of bills was /lied at the State House in Boston today prior to the 5 p.m , deadline for consideration by the 1952 Legislature . Among these were seven filed by the Metropolitan Transit Authority , The MTA bills were aimed primarily at reducing its continuously growing annual deficit which must be paid by the 14 communities which it serves . Senator Sumner G. Whittier ( R ) of Everett immediately criticised the legislative program of the MTA , charging that its ultimate goal is for a fare increase . Aims to Cut Deficit In its first bill filed , the MTA seeks to have scheduled repayment of the cost of construction of new projects eliminated from its annual cost of service and paid directly by the communities served by the transit service . The MTA trustees estimated such a move would reduce the deficit by $1,000.000 a year . Senator Whittier called this " the old cloak and dagger trick  --  the public is going to get the dagger , but all it will see will be the cloak , " he commented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' pocketbook would provide that the cities and towns serviced by the MTA reimburse it for all monies spent for snow removal expenses within each city or town , Fare Hike Forecast The MTA legislative program was described by Senator Whittier as an " echo of past legislation  --  some good , some bad , " " Some of it is an effort to make the approaching annual deficit for 1951 and the years ahead look smaller . . . . But in reality , it does n't change the amount at all , " continued Senator Whittier . The things to come from the trustees appointed by Governor Dever , " are all bad news for the public , " added the senator . In the not too distant future , he forecast , the price of tokens will jump a penny at a time in experimental increases to test pub . lie reaction . " Then , the head of Administra- tion and Finance , a faithful Democratic Party man , will sneak-a bill in the back door asking for a poll tax on every man and woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change , but this is the present plan , and the set of MTA bills filed today is only part of the story , charged Senator Whittier . Among the remaining MTA bills was one that would allow it to use old passenger count to figure the percentage of deficit to be assessed upon the communities served by the system . Another bill would increase from $10,000,000 to $15,000,000 the amount of bonds which the authority may have outstanding for new passenger carrying vehicles . Still another would exempt the MTA from state taxes on fuels used by the MTA vehicles . For 1952 , the estimated taxes on gasoline and fuel oil for the system will be approximately $170,000 . Included in the list of bills filed with the clerks of the House and Senate in addition to the MTA petitions was a bill calling for a special cotnmission to study sanitary conditions in Boston . Check on Landlords Representative Christopher A. lannella ( D ) of Boston , who filed the bill , described living conditions in the North , South , and West ends of Boston as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baltimore Plan , " and would establish a housing court which would hear cases of landlords who are charged with failing to provide sufficient rubbish barrels to keep halls and back yards clean . Representative Richard R. Ca-pies ( D ) of Allston filed a bill providing for a $500 maximum fine against all landlords who fail to maintain a temperature of 72 degrees within their rented apartments . A second $200,000,000 bond issue was called for highway construction by Senator Edward W. Staves ( R ) of Southbridge . None of the funds would be available before Jan. 1 , 1953 , except when needed to match federal aid funds , under his bill .
