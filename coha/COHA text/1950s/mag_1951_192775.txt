Last week , on the front north of the Punchbowl , a whole battalion of marines - nearly 1,000 men-was moved to a mountainous front-line sector by helicopter , in the largest operation of its kind to date . Twelve big Sikorskys made a total of 162 round trips , finishing the job , without a hitch or a casualty , in 6 hr. 15 min. , almost an hour ahead of schedule . The landing point was within range of enemy mortar positions , but apparently the Reds could not see what was going on ; no hostile fire was received . <P> Marines jubilantly talked about a new weapon of war . Since World War II , they have experimented with ' copters for amphibious assaults ; the Korean experiment is an imaginative adaptation of this plan . If trucks had been used for last week 's job , 175 would have been required , and the men would have arrived tired and shaken up after jouncing over rough roads . As it was , they disembarked fresh and alert . <P> <P> The low-flying , slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whirlybirds , " " egg beaters , " " windmills " - would be sitting ducks against hostile fighter planes , or , over flat terrain , against determined antiaircraft fire . But in Korea , the U.N . controls the air over the front lines , and the same mountains that make the ' copters so useful enable them to hug the valleys and screen themselves behind ridgelines . They have proved their versatility . For months they have been used as flying ambulances , as aerial telephone-wire layers , for command tours of the front , for quick shipments of emergency supplies and weapons . Emboldened , marines expect to try them out in night troop movements , working closer to enemy guns than they have up to now . <P> Other highlights of last week 's action : Wielding flamethrowers and white-phosphorous grenades , gallant doughfeet of the U.S. 2nd Division and attached French overran the last , northernmost peak of Heartbreak Ridge , where a few diehard North Koreans were holding out from a fortified bowl-shaped depression on top . The attackers were aided by tank columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge , blasting the Communist positions on top and on the slopes . The peak was so precariously held by the allies that they were dislodged-for twelve hours-by a Red counterattack in less than company strength . Then the U.N . forces took it again , and began mopping up in the nearby hills to prevent another counterattack.
