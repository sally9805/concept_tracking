" It looked like salt , " said one of the 82 natives , recalling the shower of radioactive ash that fell on Rongelap atoll in the Marshall Islands in March 1954 . " It came down like rain , and it burned when it touched your skin . " An unexpected shift of wind had carried the ash from H-bomb tests 150 miles away , off Bikini . <P> The embarrassed U.S. Navy hastily evacuated the Rongelapese to two distant islands . Navy doctors treated and kept close check on the 45 who had suffered burns . Except for some skin discoloration , they all recovered with no serious permanent damage . But for a while the transplanted Rongelapese were bitter . " We done no wrong , " they said . " We no understand why we should be punished . " <P> For more than three years the homesick and bewildered people of Rongelap stayed on in exile as charges of the U.S. Government , while nuclear experts checked the lingering radioactivity on their native island . Last year , when it became apparent that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invited a handful of native leaders to come help them plan a new village in anticipation of the islanders ' return . It was to include brand new modern houses with heat-resistant , rainproof aluminum roofs , a new school , a new hospital , a church , a radio station , scientifically planted groves of coconut designed for maximum copra production , plantations of papaya and breadfruit seedlings , and a whole new fleet of canoes for the local fishermen . <P> Last week , with the model island village ready for occupation , a U.S. Navy LST set sail from Kwajalein loaded to the scuppers with happy homeward-bound Rongelapese . They were a far cry from the worried souls who three years ago had called themselves " the poisoned people . " Good news travels fast , and because of what the Navy and the AEC had done for their atoll , many a Rongelapese who left his home long before the H-bomb blast occurred had decided to return to it . Since island law provides that every member of a Rongelap family , whether living there or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy found itself returning a boatload of 275 Rongelapese to the atoll in place of the 82 it originally carried off .
