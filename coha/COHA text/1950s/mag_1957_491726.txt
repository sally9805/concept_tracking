So You 'd Like to Win a Contest ! By RONALD M. DEUTSCH Here 's how Nita Parks has won mountains of merchandise , including a car and several washing machines and $25,000 in cash . She spends eight hours a day entering contests and gathering box tops . Each year America 's advertisers pour some *5,000,000 into treasure chests which  --  like Ali 13-aha 's cave  --  can be opened with a few magic words . In fact , hardly a day passes without bringing some lucky contest winner anything from a flowing oil well to a year 's supply of noodle soup . With all this plunder lying around , it is no wonder that millions of Americans type or neatly print their names on entry blanks and take flier : at contests big and little . And it should come as no surprise that contesting , like any other sporting pursuit , has its own organized devotees , the National Contest Association : its own press , Contest Magazine ; and even its own champions . No one knows just who the world 's champion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother named Nita Parks ranks as one of the nation 's top contenders . So phenomenal has her success been that even the Wall Street Journal has been impressed by her financial achievements and has taken space to say so . When Nita Parks wants a new washing machine , car or house , she does n't ask her husband or save her money . She enters a contest . The list of her wins fills four closely typed pages , and an even better measure of their extent can be taken by describing part of a typical day in her lift . At 6:30 the strains of Oh , What a Beautiful Morning ! sound in her bedroom , and a Gs SoYou 'd Like to Tin a Contest ! ( Continued from Page 391 lighter she has just snared in Ed Sullivan 's Mercury contest . She smiles fondly at Sullivan 's engraved signature and best wishes . The rest of the day is much like this . For Mrs. Parks has garnered prizes by the hundreds . many of them duplicities . There is hardly a retails ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nita 's watches , and few who do n't toast their bread , fry their potatoes or cook their waffles in One of her wins . " I hardly ever set out after duplicates , like some contesters , " says Mrs. Parks . " That is n't fair . 1 know one girl who won three cars in one year , and another girl who 's always winning bicycles  --  four last year alone . Of course , some of the girls are always after mink coats . but that 's more understandable . " Despite her success , Mrs. Parks is not a professional . " There 's no such thing , " she says . " You ca n't make a living at it . " A spokesman for The Reuben H. Donnelley Corporation , m which judges perhaps 75 per cent of the nation 's big-money contests , agrees . " Our clients , " he says , " have put up well over lifts million dollars in prizes in the last twenty years . Very little of this has gone to the contest hobbyists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another is that choosing winners for anything but the best entry would make a contest a game of chance , a loners , and hence illegal . Our judging methods guarantee absolute impartiality . An Alabama Supreme Court decision backed that up . " Mrs. Parks is one of some 10,000 members of various contest clubs . " There are tens of thousands of other people who contest regularly , but do n't belong . " says a vice-president of the National Contest Association . " Many people hose said that , next to stamp collecting , contesting is the most popular hobby in the country . I do n't know if that 's really true or not . " Most of our members arc housewives , schoolteachers and retired people . We do n't get many men , " she reports wistfully . " And we do n't win all the contests .. Most of the best of us average maybe a thousand to fifteen hundred dollars a year in cash and merchandise . Nita averages about eight thousand . " If you really work at contesting , sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mink or car or a nice trip to Yellowstone or something . I won ten thousand dollars once , and my barbecue and stove . and I just won the most beautiful green telephone with my telephone bills paid for a year . But Nita  --  she wins practically anything ! ' ' Among certain critics there is a tendency to regard Mrs. Parks and other contest hobbyists as acquisitive people who have found a good way of getting something for nothing . This definition does not appear to explain Mrs. Parks . For one thing , contesting is hard work . Often Mrs. Parks spends eight hours a day in a cubbyhole off her kitchen , poring over box tops , entry blanks and soap advertising . Surrounded by cartons overflowing with labels and other " qualifiers " ? the proofs of purchase which most contests require  --  she pounds out 50 to 100 entries a week . Then there is the grinding labor demanded by all creative work . " You do n't just toss these thimes off , " says Mrs. Parks . " It takes great concentration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few words . And then you need imagination to bring out something about the product that maybe the sponsor himself has n't thought of . " T nice to huvc so ample a supplement to one 's income , " A year 's supply of shoelaces , " he points out softly , " does not pay the electricity bills . " Mr. Parks neared open rebellion when Nita appeared as guest in a local radio panel show called What 's My Hidden Talent ? The panelists , stymied by Nita , asked if her husband approved of her hidden talent . She answered that his approval was doubtful , Later , learning of Nita'scontest winnings , a panelist quipped , " Ca n't your husband get accustomed to the manner in which you 're supporting him ? " Parks was not amused . He is a quiet , sedate man of business who is a quality-control engineer for Acrojet-General , a firm which makes Jaw units and guided-missiles components . His world is one of statistics and production reports , from which he determines the mathematical probabilities of machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be repaired before it breaks down . Friends feel that Mr. Parks has borne up well under the alternate jubilation and despair of living with a champion contester , Usually he says nothing about it . But when a breakfast-food contest is on , and he finds before him every morning for a month the seine crunchy flakes , lie has been known to look ominous before dipping a spoon into it . " The only time Hal has been completely pleased , I think , " says Nita , " was when I won a pair of back-up lights for his car . " Now and then , Mr. Parks permits himself a comment . Sonic time ago Nita took first prize in a National Safety Council contest requiring the last line of a limerick about a woman who hurt her hack moving a bed so she could clean under it , Mrs. Parks supplied : " Leave the dust if you must till help 's near . " " I ca n't think of anyone better qualified to write about leaving dust under beds , " Parks remarked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hate housework , and contesting gives me a good excuse for not doing it . I wish someone would run a contest that gave away maids . " Nita Parks ' early life was in the best traditions of American championship . She was horn in a one-room cabin of hand-hewn logs with , ? Nouse , no doctor in attendance . The year was 1907 , and ee , ee tsr her parents were James and Pearl I gate of French descent , who were struggling to make a go of a timbered homestead in Northern Minnesota . Nita 's childhood was spent on remote farms in South Dakota and Iowa . In her senior-high-school year , in Marshalltown , lowa , she left school to marry a traveling trombonist , After five years of sitting on a new bandstand every night to glamorize her husband 's entertainers  --  she could n't sing or play an instrument  --  Nita asked for a divorce . She got it on the ground of mental cruelty  --  maintaining that her spouse 's trombone meant more to him than she did . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave the children . Gerald and Robert , with her mother and hunt work in Detroit , She found a job as a waitress and led a lonely life until , one day in 1935 , she stepped into a revolving door with a home-appliance demonstrator . Threedays later they were married , The demonstrator was Halmond Parks . " By 1950. " recalls Nita , " things looked pretty good . Butch and Charlene had been born . Hal was quality-control director of Ball Brothers  --  the Mason jar manufacturers  --  in Muncie , Indiana . " Both the older boys were away at college . I had just two children and the house to care for , and was I bored ! read and read until the only thing left on the drugstore rack was Contest Magazine . I bought it . You know , I never really ' believed anybody ever won those big contests before that . But it sure sounded like fun . " Without hesitating , Mrs. Parks bought boxloads of things she needed for qualifiers . " For months there was nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap and breakfast food . " Buying a dictionary , a rhyming dictionary and a thesaurus , Nita began working ten hours a day . She signed up for two correspondence courses in contesting and studied them simultaneously . " I never went to college , " says Mrs , Parks . " So I had a lot to learn  --  all the fine points about contest rules , for example . " She pursued more technical literary studies as well . " 1 had a lot to learn about writing , " she says , " Things like when to put key product sales points in red or capitals , and when to underline , Also , there was poetic meter . You have to study that or you could never write good last lines for jingles and limericks . If the first line goes ria-Dunt der-Darn da-Drmr-da , you ca n't win with a line like Dum-da-da Dion-du-do Da-dun . " " You have to remember , " says Hal Parks wryly , " that among other things it 's not easy for a woman to learn to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first two months of contesting Mrs. Parks pounded out more than 500 entries , Nothing happened . Then a Chicago radio station offered a " beautiful nylon bag " to the writer of the best line using names of celebrities as words . Wrote Nita , " Benny fiddles , Crracie twiddles , while George Burns ! " " I thought it was sort of cute at the time , " she says . " It won . But the bag turned out to be a mesh shopping bag . " Within only six weeks and 300 entries Mrs. Parks hit again  --  this time six tickets to a drive-in movie . But the tickets could be used only two at a time , and the theater was in Indianapolis , about sixty miles away . After four months , Nita totted up the score . On one side she set her trophies , and , on the other , her time , study , postage and other expenditures . The task showed a disproportionate list of liabilities . Shc promptly quit . Luckily , fate did not permit the wasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19,57 ' morning brought greetings from the National Youth Temperance Council and a fifty-dollar check for the statement : " I 4think social drinking is stupid because moncy and time thus spent if wisely used could practically remake the world. - ' Rather than venture into such literary ' niceties as punctuation . Nita left them out entirely . Yet the core of talent could not be denied . Overjoyed , Nita and Hal hurried down to the Moose lodge , cashed the check and celebrated , Certain she had arrived , Mrs. Parks ' pressed on . But the net four months pro- only four hooks on completing the limenek , two pounds of lard and some assorted meats . She lost heart . But rallying her spirits in a final effort , Nita drove ? herself to one more composition : Why I Like to Shop F rom the Spiegel Mail Order Catalogue . It won a lady 's pin watch . Nita was on her way . In rapid succession she scored for a metal step stool , a dust mop and pronged duster , a fifty-dollar bond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Torchy Animal Crackers contest , And the entry goes sonic indication of how far her mastery of technique had come : " Melt-in-the-mouth Torchies inch the ice at teen-lime parties , make shy ones laugh , keeps the boisterous buss and starts conversation rolling . " Fumbling her grammar at the halfway mark , Mrs. Parks nesertheless muddled through . " The important thing , " she says , " is to see the possibilities hidden in something like an animal cracker . " From that time the wins were regular . and a dismayed Hal began keeping books on the taws he would hase to pay . " But he was %cr ? understanding . " says Nita . " The only thing that made him and the rest of the family mad was a habit of mine , When we took a walk , I 'd be bound to notice a perfectly good label or two in someone 's trash barrel . Well , there was only one thing to do , but the family would pretend not to know me for two blocks . Nowadays , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Parks began to develop a leaning for plays on words which colleagues feel is her true forte . Required to title an abstract painting , she called it " Mess Production , " and won a magazine sub-scription , She picked up ten dollars for a statement on a pancake mix : " The sigh-cue when gourmets compete . " She wrote that . as a careful comparison shopper , she preferred a certain brand of shoes because she was " madly shnesy . " When Swanson Canned Chicken asked for a name for its new chicken salad , an inspired Nita dubbed it " Swansong Salad . " So captivated were the sponsors by the wit of this that they ignored the lugubrious overtones and handed over their prize , In August of 1951 , a year and several thousand entries after she began contesting , Mrs. Parks was quietly dyeing her hair in the kitchen when she heard a car drive up . Until 1936 her hair had been black . When Charlene was born in that year , it turned white overnight , she maintains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Mrs. Parks , " 1 was making a mess out of dyeing it , when I heard the car . So I wrapped my hair in a towel and peeked out the front door . " Dripping black drops , Mrs. Parks looked out to sec a stern-looking man in a snap-brim hat . Shc flung the door wide with the happy greeting , " I 'll bet you 're an investigator ! " At this point it should be explained that sponsors do not giveaway big prizes without taking a second took . When entries arc boiled down to a top few dozen , detectives are hired . " We want to know the entrant really exists , " say the judges . " We also want to he sure she actually wrote the entry , and that she 's not related to anyone working for the sponsor . Then we complete the judging . " Most contest hobbyists arc suspicious of investigators and handle their interviews with artful reluctance . They admit there is no logical reason for such behavior , yet they refuse to give their names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to whisper facts ; Mout contests which are in plain view in the public prints . Says one contester frankly , " I guess it 's more fun that way . " Not so , Mrs. Parks . When the investigator called , she hurried him into the kitchen , poured him a cup of coffee and regaled him with talcs of her contesting experience . " After all . " she explains , " he was the first person I ever mei who had anything to do with contesting as seen from the sponsor 's side . " Mrs. Parks wrote a limerick last line to demonstrate her ability to do creditable work , and turned liver copies of her entries in the contest . The investigator asked 63 if she was indeed Nita K. Parks , and she said she . was not . She was Nita R. Parks . Then she explained that she had keyed each of her forty-seven entries with differ-em middle initials and such , so she could tell which of her entries had won , With Nita 's hair still dripping black from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a notary public . Contestants must vouch for their authorship of the entry and relieve the sponsor of certain legal obligations . Mrs. Parks knew that if , in the final judging . she did n't win , she might never 64 TUE SATURDAY EY ism tvu LIST hear more . After three weeks , hope faded . Anyway . she was busy moving her family to Wilmington . Illinois . Nearly two months after the investigator 's call , Nita heard from a Muncie neighbor that a man had been asking questions in the old neighborhood . Hope renewed . Mrs. Parks dropped a note to the contest judges . Two days later she got a call from Chicago . " We 'd almost given you up , " the man said . " Stay where you tire . We 're sending a man out . " " Well , I thought they were delivering an electric iron or something , " says Mrs , Parks , " lila the man who came just asked me to go to Chicago with him . I said I would , if Hal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked questions . Hal was annoyed about losing a day 's work . But I got no answers . Finally we got out at the Palmolise Building , and they were taking pictures and a man was handing me a piece of paper . I could n't see what it was , so . when it was over , I whispered to Hal , ' What is it ? ' " He had this funny stunned look on his face , and he said , ' A check for twenty-five thousand dollars. ? The Parks family was numh for several days . Reporters called . Daughter Charlene brought curious friends to look at her mother . A thousand letters poured in , " Mostly they were just from people who were happy for me . Some wanted to know what my entry was , but you 're nor allowed to tell that in big contests . I answered every letter myself .

Then she talked off the cuff for forty-five minutes . " Nita was never at a loss for words , " says H a I. The wins now really flooded in , one for every thirty or forty entries , a rate which Continues today . Mrs. Parks had discovered a winning secret . " The answers to the contests are all around you , " she Says . " You just ! lase to notice them . I was working on this hosiery-slogan contest , and Charlene was tn.ang to get me to iron her blouse while she did her homework , and buttering me up in a nice sort of way . I said flattery would gel her no place , and ( hen I had it  --  the hosiery slogan , ' The fiat ' cry that gets you places ! ' " That 's how we got Duke , " she smiles . patting her cocker . Soon after , the Parkses mused again  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . A telegram finally reached Nita , and a few days later she was accepting a jackpot or prizes from the radio show Grand Slam , and a S100 watch from Rinso . And not long afterward she was in a showroom choosing colors for her new Ford , courtesy of Osydol . Mrs. Parks ' continuing wins have not banished financial worries from the household . They have , at times , multiplied them . Her taxes on the 525,000 alone came to 38200 . And most prizes are merchandise . Hal coughs up the tax money . " I do n't like to ask Nita to sell anything to raise the money , " says Hal , " But sometimes it makes me a little nervous seeing new deep-fat fryers and toasters coming in one day and going out the nem wrapped as gifts . Even though the taxes were rough , it was nice to see Nita get the new car . But right off she ran it into a tree and decided she did n't like to drisc . " Shortly after a recent tax bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hal figured it might be best tosell the house and get a smaller one . But no one was interested in the house . He worried , but said little . Nita quietly headed for Hollywood and the studio audience of Queen for a Day , She filled out a blank there . " And in fifteen minutes , " she says , " I was on the air asking for advertising help to sell the house . A good contester knows how to get attention , " The next day , Mrs. Parks was lounging in the Queen-for-a-Day Cadillac , en route to a beauty parlor and a whirl of night spots . In her purse was $500 to pay for advertising , together with certificates for quite a bit of other booty . " Which goes to show what contesting can do , " says Nita . " The five hundred helped us keep the house .

" Recently , after one of her ladies ' - club lectures , Mrs. Parks was approached by an admirer who said . " You really ought to write a book . " A distinctly open-minded woman , Mrs. Parks retreated to her kitchen cubbyhole and within a fess weeks not only had her manuserjpt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had persuaded a book firm to publish it . The publisher in turn persuaded Mrs. Parks to change the title to How to Win a Fortune . " There was a lull in contests there for d while , " says Nita , " and I do hate just to sit around doing nothing . " What was probably Mrs. Parks ' crowning achievement in using a well-turned phrase to her purposes came not tong ago . Deciding to take in a roomer , she determined to phrase her ad to bring in a young man suited to the family . She recalls it went something like : " Wanted . Respectable , amiable young man who appreciates home with quiet refined family . " " He moved in within forty-eight hours , " says Mrs. Parks , Some time later Mrs. Parks entered a contest in the Pasadena Independent , which wanted experiences resulting from one of its classified ads . Wrote Mrs. Parks : " I am enclosing a picture of the adorable baby that came to us via an Independent want ad ... " The picture was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband , the former roomer . The letter brought a twenty-live-dollar prize . Hal Parks says in a rather awed tone , " You know . sometimes it 's just amazing what happens around here when Nita sits down at her typewriter . "
