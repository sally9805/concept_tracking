BATTLE OF KOREA Night &; Day Just after midnight one night last week , some 750 Chinese Reds tried to storm a western-front strong point called T-Bone Hill , after stealthily cutting the U.N . barbed wire in the darkness . The next night , after an artillery and mortar barrage of 2,500 rounds , the Reds overran an eastern-front position called Luke the Gook 's Castle , were later beaten off . Both attacks served merely as harassments , but they helped to make the winter nights ugly for U.N . troops . Shivering in three-above-zero cold on the Imjin sector , an 18-year-old soldier from The Bronx said : " It 's like any other night-just too damned long . " Probably no soldiers on earth really prefer fighting at night , but the Chinese and North Koreans have good and obvious reasons for avoiding daylight assaults . The U.N . artillery , close air support and air observation function best by day . At night it takes about 20 minutes for star shells or a flare plane to illuminate a combat area , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artillery , though abundant , is sluggish in following a moving target . <P> If the Reds have good reasons for attacking at night , the U.N . has equally good ones for assaults by day . Not only do the allied artillery , air support and air observation function best in daylight , but U.N . commanders and troops like to see what they are doing and where they are going . They have found that when things go wrong at night , they can go " awfully wrong " - meaning that nocturnal confusion causes unnecessary casualties . Also , if the enemy has succeeded in grabbing a U.N . outpost during the night , it pays the U.N . to counterattack at dawn 's early light , so as to give the burrowing Reds little or no time to dig in . And if the enemy can use night harassments to rob U.N . troops of sleep , the U.N . can return the favor by harassing the enemy by day .                  @ @ @
