Redskins // 37 10 // 261 133 // 270 114 // 18-32 9-24 // The Quarterback lumbered casually out of the huddle , leaned on the center 's backside with his left hand and looked the situation over . Then the curiously high-pitched voice snapped out the count with immense confidence , and the Philadelphia Eagles went into action from the New York Giant 13-yard line . // Norman Van Brocklin took the snap from center , trotted unhurriedly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big Giant linemen , most of whom are easily as fast as Van Brocklin , rumbled down on him as he looked . He faked a throw once , still moving toward the right slowly , still searching for a free receiver . The linemen were very close now , and Van Brocklin , with some 1,000 pounds of disaster falling on him , finally lofted the ball gently toward the Giant end zone . Clarence Peaks , the very fast Eagle halfback , broke free as the ball began to drop and ran under it in the untenanted corner of the end zone for a touchdown . Van Brocklin picked himself up after the Giant linemen unpiled and shambled sedately off to the sideline , the broad Dutch face wrinkled in a wide grin . // It was a typical Van Brocklin play  --  called audaciously , executed with the cold , unworried precision of a surgeon . It was the kind of a play which makes the Philadelphia Eagles a 30% better football team simply by the acquisition of this 32-year-old , well-worn but neatly patched veteran of nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possession of Van Brocklin is an unalloyed pleasure to a coach . The Dutchman has a wide streak of Dutch stubbornness and a strong respect for his own judgment . He runs a team brusquely and intelligently and brooks little interference from coaches who are fond of sending in plays . This may have been the principal point of difference between him and Sid Gillman , the coach of the Los Angeles Rams . Van Brocklin , who has been known to run the same unsuccessful play three times simply to prove that it can work , does not take kindly to the strict sideline direction of the Paul Brown school of coaching , and often Gillman 's messages , via shuttling linemen , only irritated Van Brocklin. // He retired briefly at the end of last season , principally because he did n't want to play for Gillman . Van Brocklin has a fierce pride , and Gillman , obviously content to go with the more tractable Bill Wade at quarterback , did n't play Van enough to suit the Dutchman . Van Brocklin , who resented taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resented even more occupying the same position to Wade . He stayed retired long enough for the Rams to make a trade with the Philadelphia Eagles . // " I did n't much want to come to the Eagles , " Van said the other day . " You ca n't beat that West Coast living . But what else am I going to do ? I guess if I knew what I 'm going to do when I get through , I 'd start doing it now . " Since he has a warm , ingratiating personality and a master 's degree in physical education , Van Brocklin 's worries about a post-football career seem a bit exaggerated . He is an interesting split personality  --  off the field he is relaxed , fond of giving imitations ( possibly his best is of Esther Williams climbing out of a swimming pool for a safety razor ad ) ; during a game , he is likely to be irascible , a tremendous competitor with small patience for mistakes . Technically , he is probably the best passer in the league . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passer but immensely strong . His rubbery , slightly heavy-set body has absorbed the pounding a pro quarterback is heir to without injury . Van Brocklin is a surprisingly adept ball handler in view of his lack of speed . And his enthusiastic respect for his acumen as a play selector is justified . // " I like playing for Buck Shaw , " he said . " He 's a quarterback 's coach . " Translated , that means that Shaw , who got his early training in permissiveness as the coach of the 49ers when the uninhibited Frankie Albert was quarterback , lets the quarterback call his own game . // " Not that I 'm criticizing Gillman , " Van Brocklin went on . " I ca n't say anything against him . He never said anything to me that I could get mad about . He told some other people that he wanted to get rid of me , but he never told me. " // Gillman got an offensive tackle and a defensive halfback for Van Brocklin , both first-line pro players , and the Eagles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the league would consider that he got the best of the trade . In nine seasons Van Brocklin has led the league in passing three times , in punting twice . He holds almost every Ram passing record , and he has thrown 118 touchdown passes going into the 1958 season . He can fire a slingshot-fast short pass or , with an easy flick of his meaty right arm , loft a 60-yard floater more accurately than any other thrower in the league . In a position where the knack of taking charge is , next to marksmanship , the supreme asset , he is firmly in the saddle every minute he is on the field . // AIR THREAT HELPS // Last year the Eagles lost twice to the New York Giants , and the 1957 edition of the Giants was not nearly as good as the 1958 club . When Van Brocklin left the field Sunday , in his heavy-footed , slow trot , he left with a 27-24 victory . Of course , not all the difference was Van Brocklin ; the Eagle running game is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition of Billy Wells , a Pittsburgh castoff , who had a great day . // But  --  and here is another reason for Van Brocklin 's tremendous value to any team  --  the Giants had to worry first about the Eagle air attack , and with very good reason , since the Dutchman completed 16 of 34 passes for 238 yards and two touchdowns. // Van is happy with the Eagles now . He has only one regret  --  the Rams are not scheduled to play the Eagles this year . And that may be the reason Gillman selected Philadelphia to trade the Dutchman to . // With Van Brocklin , the Eagles , after two games , appear to be the strongest threat to the Cleveland Browns for the Eastern Conference championship . The Browns , however , need fear no one , Van Brocklin included , in their division . After a shaky venture into the West and a 30-27 victory over Los Angeles , the Browns last week found the Pittsburgh Steelers so easy a victim ( 45-12 ) that Paul Brown rested his best quarterback , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the fourth quarter . It becomes clearer with each week that Brown has finished the rebuilding process needed when Otto Graham retired . // The Chicago Cardinals , using some single-wing to supplement Pop Ivy 's new double-wing T , surprised Washington and , possibly , Ivy with a magnificent running and passing attack to win easily , 37-10 . The game may have spelled the end of Lamar McHan as a first-string quarterback ; M. C. Reynolds , taking over from McHan late in the second quarter , completed 16 of 25 passes for 228 yards . // Coach Weeb Ewbank 's five-year plan for the Baltimore Colts is right on schedule : the Colts are a superbly balanced team with all the tools a pro club must have . They proved that by whipping the Bears 51-38 and taking position as the clear-cut favorite in the West . Age appears to have withered Detroit too much ; the Lions struggled for a 13-13 tie with Green Bay . The most ominous note of warning for Baltimore came from the West : the Los Angeles Rams , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing and a ferocious defense to rout San Francisco 33-3.
