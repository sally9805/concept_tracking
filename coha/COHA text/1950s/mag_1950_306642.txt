Scientists , often suspicious of political advice from laymen , listen attentively when their colleague , tall , mild-mannered Dr. Frederick Seitz , 38 , of the University of Illinois , has something to say . One of the most respected of U.S. physicists , he played a key part in the wartime development of the atom bomb . In an article in the current Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists Dr. Seitz issues a call to arms which has caused an extraordinary stir in scientific circles . <P> U.S. physicists , says Seitz , must forget their " sense of sin " about the atomic bomb and their feelings of guilt . They must abandon their " one world " pacifism . They must pitch in and help at once , or the civilization they love will sink back into medieval darkness . <P> What is this civilization ? " The awakening of Western Europe that is normally called the Renaissance , ' 1 says Seitz , " brought something into the lives of men that had never before existed . . . The basic idea was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger sense by any pattern of dogma or tradition , but should be free to explore all aspects of life in all fields without restraint . . . " <P> No Compromise . The Russia of Ivan the Terrible , Seitz points out , did not participate in the Renaissance . " The 1917 Revolution seemed at first to be a step which would greatly accelerate the process of Westernization . . . But the Soviet leaders have ' abandoned the idea of the Renaissance and are now in the process of developing a pattern of culture as burdened with dogma as . . . anything known in the past millennium . . . " <P> Dr. Seitz has little hope of reconciliation . The best that can be hoped for is a walled-off truce , but even this will be impossible , he points out , unless " the military strength of the Western nations is maintained at a level so great that Russia will not be willing to attack us ... I do not believe we can afford to refrain from accelerating our arms program beyond the present year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unwise . " <P> Physicist Seitz knows that some of his colleagues hate to develop new means of mass slaughter . They distrust military men , cringe at the thought of exposing themselves to spy hunts . But Dr. Seitz is convinced that they must . Otherwise , they will endanger " the most important ideals which have been evolved by mankind since the dawn of civilization . . . Who among us will feel sinless if he has remained passively by while Western culture was being overwhelmed ? <P> " I believe the time is ripe for physicists , and scientists in general , to devote a much larger fraction of their time to research of military interest . . . " At present , Dr. Seitz says , there is not much opportunity or encouragement for such high-type recruits . Government money is not lacking , but Government research agencies have not enough imagination , leadership or freedom to act . One trouble , of wide concern to scientists , is congressional sniping .               @ @ @ @ @ @
