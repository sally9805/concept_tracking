For the first time in eight months Britain 's pound was able to look the U.S. dollar in the eye last week . In London , Zurich , New York , Tokyo , wherever money is exchanged , the pound fetched its full par value of $2.80 , halting the heavy drain on Britain 's gold and dollar reserves and all talk of imminent devaluation . The renewed confidence in the pound was the result of a tough new policy of boosting Britain 's bank rate from 5% to 7% , thus tightening up the money supply to curb runaway home-front inflation . <P> Within days , traders on world money markets , who had been selling pounds hoping to buy back at lower rates later on , reversed their course .

Our policy is to halt the increase in the supply of money . In years ahead , it will be harder to earn profits under this policy . It will be harder to get wage increases-they will need to be earned . But the profits and wages will be paid in honest pounds . "
