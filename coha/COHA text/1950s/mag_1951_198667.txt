In full-page ads last week , Manhattan 's Macy 's , world 's largest department store , asked : " Why are you buying so much , New York ? . . . It 's the beginning of fear-buying . Since Christmas the people of New York have been buying about 25% more goods in all department stores than they did at this time last year . " <P> All over the U.S. , buying was high , though it was ebbing slightly . U.S. department-store sales last week were 31% higher than a year ago , v. 39% the week before . Said Macy 's : " Buy nothing out of fear . Buy only what you need or can use . But do n't buy one extra thing because of ' what might happen . ' There are goods enough to satisfy our needs . But there can never be goods enough to satisfy our fears . "
