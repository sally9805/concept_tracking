txt CHICAGO , May ** Dubinsky , long a prime mover in the fight to rid organized labor of crime , took a pioneering step today in his efforts to keep grafters and racketeers from entrenching themselves in his union , the International Ladies Garment Workers Union , A. F. L. Elected to a new three-year term as president of the union , Mr. Dubinsky disclosed that he had appointed a confidential investigator to serve full time on his personal staff to help safeguard the organization against the intrusion of corrupt elements . The job will be filled by Herman Bass , 35 years old , a Brooklyn lawyer who has spent the last two years working with the New York State Crime Commission in its investigations of waterfront labor rackets and of links between polltics and crime in upstate - communities . Mr. Dubinsky stressed that the appointment was being made not because he felt there were any bad situations in the union that required cleaning up but because he wanted to be sure the union would stay clean . " With the growth of our union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that none of our officers or organizers betrays the trust the union has placed in // them , " Mr. Dubinsky said , add-ing : " I know of no other union that has taken a step of this kind , and I believe we are setting an example that others will find it ' worth while to follow . " The disclosure that Mr. Bass had been appointed and would assume his duties at the union 's New York headquarters next Monday was made soon after 1,000 delegates had closed the garment workers ' triennial convention by re-electing all the union officers and voting Mr. Dubinsky a salary increase of $5,200 a year . His annual pay will go up from $18,200 to $23,400 . The general executive board had planned to recommend a presidential salary of $30,000 or $35,000 a year , but Mr. Dubinsky told his associates that he would not accept an income that large .

He said that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a staff of 1,600. paid union officers . Under the new set-up , Mr. Bass will inquire into the bank accounts , financial dealings and personal associations of officials the union has reason to suspect . He will operate by direct assignment of Mr. Dubinsky and will report to him . His services also will be available to the union 's locals and joint boards in investigating specific situations . The garment workers ' constitution requires that all paid ' officers must file undated resignations when they enter their jobs . These may be invoked by the parent union , the locals or the joint board whenever their executive boards are convinced that the union 's best interests require an officer 's ouster . This forced resignation procedure has been invoked only twice in the last nine years , but it provides a readily available instrument for policing the union in any situation Mr. Bass may uncover . Mr. Bass began his investigative career as a clerk on the legal staff of Thomas E. Dewey , when the now Governor ' was District Attorney of New York County before World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined the staff of District Attorney Frank S. Hogan as a confidential clerk .

' Chiseler Socialism ' Scored The other officers re-elected included the union 's first vice president , Luigi Antonini ; its executive secretary , Fred F. Umhey , and twenty-one vice presidents . The only vacancy among the vice presidents was filled through the election of Israel Horowitz of New York , director of the Eastern outof-town department , to succeed the late Israel Feinberg . Mr. Horowitz , who is 65 , has been a garment worker for fifty-one years . Mr. Dubinsky devoted a major ' part of his acceptance speech to Ian appeal to Congress to_the revise the income tax laws so as to prevent communities in the South and in other nonunion areas from issuing- tax-exempt bonds to finance the building of " runaway " garment plants . He charged that these plants were being offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to chiselers seeking bargains in rent and bargains in labor . " " The . risk of the factory is shared by all citizens , " the union leader said , " while the profits of the factory are pocketed by the chiseler . The chiseler shouts free enterprise . He shows his enterprise by getting the taxpayers ' money free . This can be called ' chiseler socialism , ' or a welfare state for ' gypsy ' employers . "
