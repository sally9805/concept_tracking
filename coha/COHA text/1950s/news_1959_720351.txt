txt WASHINGTON , April 6 ? The " double jeopardy " rule of procedure laid down for the Department of Justice by Attorney General Rogers ' is a model not only for administrators of government . It is a model for the judicial and legislative branches as well , and the same can be said of many of this Attorney General 's acts and policies . " The mere existence of a power , " he wrote in a memorandum to ' United States Attorneys , . " does not mean that it should necessarily be exercised . * * * Those of us charged with law enforcement responsibi'ities have a particular duty to act wisely and with self-restraint . " The memorandum was evoked by ' the Supreme Court 's latest affirmaI tion of the public power to prosecute defendants under both Federal and state laws for the same act or acts , and by a comment Justice Black made in dissenting . " The power to try a second time , " he predicted , " will be used , as have all similar procedures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial minorities and those who differ , who do not conform and who resist tyranny . " The purpose and effect of the memorandum were to give firm public notice that no such Federal use will be made of the power in , this Administration while William P. Rogers is Attorney General . " No Federal case should be tried , " his order runs , " where there has already been a state prosecution for substantially the same act or acts without the United States Attorney first submitting a recommendation to the appropriate Assistant Attorney General * * * or should be approved by him without having it first brought to my attention . " And so long as future Federal law officers , follow this rule , the use of the power by the central Government will be , thus restrained . , The Rogers precept can not bind , the states because a single criminal , act may involve a violation of state , I law separate from the violation of Federal law , and this can lead to the double prosecution the Supreme Court again has sanctioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ecutive power by any government ' the Rogers rule is as sound and just a precept for the legal officers ' of the states as for the Federal es-1 tablishrnent . And by conceiving and publishing it the Attorney General of the United States undoubtedly has advanced the day of conformity by states . Since in certain crimes against the public order and security there is , as the Attorney General pointed out , " a series of related acts , " double prosecution can not be totally abandoned without sacrifice of the public interest . This factor is quite ' apart from the right to enforce their laws of the " two sovereignties " ? state and Federal  --  that the Su-1 preme Court again acknowledged as woven into the constitutional fabric of the Republic . In such crimes the criminal is not only he who pulled , ' the trigger , or planted the bomb , or ' set it off . It is also he who conceived and/or planned an act , especially 1 one which was not the affair of just an hour or a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meal flaw or a jury 's foolish verdict , ' a criminal charged with an offense against a Federal law is acquitted in that jurisdiction , the public inter'est is served by trying him in the state court for a separate offense , by this same act against a state law.l And vice versa . But , as Rogers ' , noted in his memorandum , these circumstances will " seldom arise . " ' And to assure them full consideration before a second prosecution ? if ' I Federal  --  also that this be invoked only on the highest legal authority , 1he reserved both functions to the Attorney General in person . Rogers himself is the sole source both of this rule for the Depart- ' ment of Justice and the memorandum which embodies it . As soon as the texts became available to him of the Supreme Court 's " double 1 jeopardy " decisions , and the dissent ' ing prophecy of Justice Black that they would be tyrannously used to oppress minorities , the Attorney General began to write his order . It was drafted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court .
