THE WAY OF A SHIP ( 429 pp. ) - Alan Villiers-Scribner ( $6.50 ) . <P> <P> The full-rigged , deep-sea sailing-ship is gone , perhaps forever , and the man who mourns her most eloquently is Australia-born Alan Villiers . Anyone familiar with his earlier books ( The Set of the Sails , Cruise of the Conrad ) might suppose that Sailor-Author Villiers had unloaded his full cargo of grief and nostalgia , but not so . The Way of a Ship makes it clear that , after his seven trips around the Horn , sails will be flapping in his memory for life . A bit long on statistics , the book is nevertheless a fine armchair way of getting down to the sea in sailing-ships . <P> Here is the story of the Preussen , the great German five-master , " without a doubt the greatest sailing-ship the world has seen ... a supership , a swift giantess among all sailing-ships , the ultimate expression of deepwater Sail . " When all of her 30 square-sails were stretched , she presented 60,000 square feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture of defiance flung at the mechanical age " met the fate of many a lovely sailing-ship . In 1910 at the mouth of the English Channel she was rammed by a " blundering steamer , " was so weakened that a subsequent gale broke her back and sent her aground . <P> Partisans of the American clippers may be surprised to find that the Germans produced not only the greatest ships but some of the greatest captains as well . To Villiers , once a skipper in sail himself and not easily given to hero worship , the giant of them all was Robert Hilgendorf , the " Devil of Hamburg . " No one ever equaled his skill at rounding the Horn , and there were plenty of sailing men who believed that he could control the winds with black magic . Hilgendorf himself did not care to press his skill ; he quit at an early 50 to take a soft job ashore with an insurance company . <P> Villiers may be a partisan of sail , but he is no salt-sprayed sentimentalist . Sailing men may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first and foremost a source of employment , a means of livelihood . The sailor hated the sea as a savage enemy . " Says Author Villiers tartly : " It is landsmen who speak of ' the call of the sea . ' " The pay was wretched and the food was often worse . When steam brought hard times , many owners made up crews of teen-age boys who paid for the experience . One such crew of youngsters on the famed Cutty Sark got little but pea soup and " boiled salt horse " during a voyage of many months , and biscuits so hard that they had to be smashed with belaying pins . <P> What Villiers mourns is the passing of sailing as a great art , of sailing-ships as things of beauty , of deep-water sail as a moulder of character . " There was no other career comparable with it , " says he , ' nor is there likely to be again . "                   @ @
