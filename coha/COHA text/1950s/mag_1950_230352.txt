Modern artists from Picasso to Jacob Epstein have found inspiration in carved African idols , masks and fetishes . Last week a London gallery was showing the works of bearded Ben Enwonwu , an African carver who reversed the process . <P> Born 29 years ago in Nigeria , Enwonwu carved his own toys as a child . He was teaching art at 18 , and five years later the <P> N'gerian government sent him abroad for further study . Since then he has won a Diploma of Fine Art from the University of London , has been made a fellow of the Royal Anthropological Institute , and has become more European than African in his approach to art . <P> Enwonwu 's ancestors carved for magic purposes , not for exhibition . They gave force to their whittled gods by using many of the tricks of modern art : violent distortion of figures into angular cubistic shapes , mingling of naturalistic features with wholly abstract ones , the surrealist shock-value of giving vaguely human figures some of the attributes of animals and birds . The results struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " great sculpture-greater , I believe , than any we have made . . . " <P> Enwonwu has broken from the faith of his fathers : like most European artists since the Renaissance , he works to express human emotions , not to hint at supernatural forces . Suffering , supplication , exuberance were typical themes of his London show-themes ill-suited to violent distortion . Enwonwu sometimes let the shape and grain of the wood guide his chisel , to produce partial abstractions that merely pleased the eye . " Sometimes , " he told admirers at the show 's opening , " I see the form in my mind and it grows and grows as I work . I am happy when I am hacking out ; I never want to stop . " Smoothing the thigh of his Dancing Figure with a pink-palmed hand , he sighed and added : " But when I must finish off my work , smooth the surface and polish-then I get bored . The creation is gone . " <P> London Sunday Times Critic Eric Newton decided that " only when hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence as Enwonwu 's occur . " If the'same harmony existed between his African heritage and his European training , Enwonwu 's art might have had punch to match its polish .
