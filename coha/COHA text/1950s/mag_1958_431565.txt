 | How the United States Has Aided a New Nation An eyewitness report on Americans doing an indispensable job in a crucial area IN AN ARAB world dangerously threatened by Communist advances I recently saw , close-up , how in one country the U.S. government 's foreign-aid program is helping strengthen the position of the West . Watching that program in operation in this critical area left me citizen and taxpayerconsiderably reassured . What I saw , in hundreds of miles of travel , was a team of highly qualified Americans investing not only U.S. dollars but experience , @#  | ingenuity , patience and sweat . Through their efforts an undeveloped country is learning to grow in self-support and self-betterment as a free world nation and a firm friend of the United States . Eight years ago the North African Arab country of Libyaa sea of sand almost one fourth the size of the United Stateswas voted into nationhood by the United Nations . It selected a king and became a constitutional monarchy . Formerly part of Mussolini 's African empire , its three suddenly united provinces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recorded history been independent . Libya appeared , of all free governments , one of the most poorly fitted to be free , and of all places one of the least promising in which to spend any part of the U. S. tax dollar . Still not fully unified , it has two capitals : Tripoli , the one fairly large city ; and , 64o miles to the east , Benghazi , much smaller and less modern but preferred by King Idris . Travelers crossing boundaries between provinces must submit to passport and luggage examinations more time-consuming than those required at most national frontiers . The land , despoiled for centuries by successive invaders , is 85 percent non-arable desert . Although the prospects that oil will be found are good , up to now no mineral resources of any consequences have been discovered . When given independence , Libya 's native population of 1,250,000 ( Moslem , and largely nomadic ) an average annual income of 1-than $35lowest of any of t world 's sovereign states . Illitera was above 90 percent . Not 5000 people had as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college graduates . There was an almost total lack qualified Libyan professional m or skilled workers , since under M solini 's regime all such jobs we reserved for colonists . Most Libya in some areas 95 percentsuffer from blindness-inducing tracho and infant mortality was among t world 's highest . With so far to go and so little go on , what could such a count possibly mean to the United States to justify its costing us , in 1957 , million dollars in foreign aid ? Tw clues to the answer to this questio were visible in the office of our U. ambassador in sun-scorched Tripoli . The first was a series of maps o the wall behind the ambassador ' desk . These maps gave startling meaning to the saying that " Libya ' one proven natural resource i geography . " On the north , strategically mid way between Gibraltar and Sue Libya fronts for more than 1000 mile on the Mediterranean ; Moscow i little more than three hours ' jet-hop away , Europe less than an hour 's . Libya 's eastern boundary extends the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab world , a base for Communist conspiracy and advance . To the west lie two countries : strife-torn , Corn- munist-infiltrated Algeria ; and Tunisia , at present a pro-Western Arab republic , in whose security against Communist propaganda and intrigue the free world has a large stake . An indication of just how important U.S. military experts rate this geographical " resource " is Toomillion-dollar Wheelus Field , seven miles from Tripoli , the largest U. S. air base outside the United States . The second clue to Libya 's importance could be seen from a window of the ambassador 's office : the Red flag flying above the huge embassy of Soviet Russia . There are no Russian residents in Libya , no Russian investments or trade . But only one embassy there is larger : Egypt 's , which is playing Russia 's game . The size of these installations , the costliness of the propaganda and subversive enterprises they promote , indicate the Communists ' estimate of Libya 's importance to their world schemes , their awareness of how much the free world gained by getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to underwrite and manage Libya 's upbuilding would be pushed aggressively if there were no effective program of U. S. aid . Undertaken at Libya 's invitation , and pursued in full cooperation with Libya , our program there began on a small scale in 1952 , was enlarged in x954 . The British have also contributed aid , and a program is carried on by agencies of the United Nations , including several health projects and a highly important agricultural experiment station . The U.S. program is directed by about 100 American specialists , working side by side with Libyans . It reaches into almost every area of the country 's life . But since some 90 percent of Libyans eke out a living from the land , it is there that the United States is concentrating . Consider a few exciting items . In a country where the livelihood of farmers so largely depends on livestock sheep , goats , camels , donkeysno Libyan had ever had any veterinarian education until , two years ago , the first group finished an elementary course taught by our animal husbandry experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insecticides , and armed with practical information , these young Libyans went back to their rural communities . One indication of the job they are doing came last year when Libya 's always-inadequate rainfall dropped , in some areas , disastrously below normal . In those areas loss of livestock was estimated at 45 percent save where these new " veterinarians " had persuaded farmers to improve the health of their animals by treatment against parasites . There the average loss was an estimated 15 percent . Now increasing numbers of farmers who once stoically accepted disaster as Allah 's will ask to be taught these practices . A common and crippling ailment of Libya 's indispensable work animal is camel scab . One of the tradi- tional treatments is to scrape raw the affected areas and rub in a mixture of salt , peppers and lime . This does not cure and may injure the camel . Now more and more Libyan farmers are learning to cure camel scab , at 28 cents a camel , with a lindane oil treatment developed by a foreign-aid specialist . The two agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculturalists . " Six are now taking advanced courses in U.S. universities ; the others are teaching or working in agricultural extension centers . We have also helped establish five farm schools for short-course training in the field , and ten village extension centers where farmers learn better methods and can buy improved seeds and a few simple but better farm tools . Farmers who have learned to plant barley in rows instead of by broadcast seeding have had a crop increase of one third . In irrigated areas the potato crop increased by almost a like amount when farmers changed from the old method of flooding to furrow irrigation . A reforestation program has increased the number of trees planted each year from 1,500,000 to nearly seven million . Pruning of fruit and olive trees was virtually unheard of ; many farmers , owning only one or two trees , resisted the idea of cutting away any part of them . But when demonstration pruning resulted in a 30 percent greater crop , demand for pruning tools began to run ahead of supply . It is in the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agricultural program are bei made . Libya has no major lakes rivers and an overall average rata fall of less than nine inches . Y4 when ruled by ancient Rome , it was called " the granary of Europe , " and supported a population as large a larger than the present one . Today we are trying to recover some me ure of that long-lost productivity . Rome 's irrigation engineers h built series of dikes across hundr of dry river beds , or wadis , to h the water from each year 's brief heavy rains and spread it out ove wide area to soak into the grou As excess water seeped through o dike , it was caught by the next . In the Wadi Gattara , some two hours northeast of Benghazi , I saw how Libyans have begun to do as the Romans did . The Wadi Gattara is a connected series of dry-stream valleys running down from the hills and cover ' several thousand acres . Farmer formerly grew a single scant crop of millet or barley each year . Today however , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four dations laid by the Romans nearly 2000 years ago . A crew of too Libyans was a work on one dike when I visited Boss of the entire job was a you 'll Libyan , trained in the field by one of our engineers . There were no expensive earth-moving machines , no power equipment of any kind . Each man worked with his camel , hitch  | as camels had never been hitched before , to a simple bucket scoop . " Invented " by an American technician and turned out in our Libyan trade school , the camel scoop is an important innovation in a country where man and animal power is the only power widely available . When completed , the Wadi Gattara system will spread water over thousands of acres . Today , water that previously ran off in four hours is being held , behind each dike , for ten . Penetration of the sandy soil which , before , seldom reached 18 inches , now reaches 36 . Yields may be increased 300 to 400 percent . Several such relatively large-scale water-spreading projects are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by farmers independently . In northern Libya there are probably 300,000 acres which , by this method , can be restored to increased production . In Libya 's still appallingly backward situation , all this adds up to no more than a start toward a profitable agriculture . But how significant it may be can be seen from an account of what has happened to Ali Silim Ghenidi , whom I met on his small farm about too miles east of Tripoli . Four years ago our agricultural people persuaded Ali Silim Ghenidi to use his few acres to prove what would result from the concentrated application of improved farm methods . With loans , he bought a steel plow and improved seed . He planted in rows . Instead of only barley , be began to grow peanuts , potatoes , tomatoes , corn . He learned furrow irrigation and the use of fertilizer . He cleaned out an old cistern , dug new wells , built a reservoir . He pruned his fruit trees . To protect his crops from the desert wind , he planted a hedge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which before had averaged between $40 and $6o , has risen to more than $500 . Farmers from many kilometers away come to his farm to see and hear how he has done it . Some of them , at least , go home and begin to do likewise . Before any U. S. funds are spent on any project , that project is investigated on the spot by a " Technical Committee " of Libyans and Americans . It undergoes further scrutiny at the hands of the Libyan-American Reconstruction Commission , a board of four Libyans and two Americans set up by the Libyan Parliament . And no money is invested by the International Cooperation Administration until plans have been approved in Washington . U. S. funds have been used to capitalize the first Libyan banks : the National Bank of Libya and the National Agricultural Bank . We have financed the construction of the country 's first two broadcasting stations to be manned by Libyans . These stations will he a potent antidote for the anti-Western , pro-Soviet poison poured out by Radio Cairo and , largely for lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every Libyan marketplace . We are  | helping finance improvements in the country 's telephone and telegraph system and in its roads . Prior to 1954 , less than ten percent of Libya 's school-age children were in school . Helped by U. S. funds and educators , many hundreds of young Libyans are now training as teachers . We drew plans for and helped many localities to build $i000 two-room schoolhouses . Today in Tripolitania approximately 40 percent of the school-age children are in school ; in Cyrenaica , some 50 percent . In 1957 , in all Libya , there were 130 high-school graduates . Every such graduate is required by the government to go on , at government expense , for further practical training . The government also pays the expenses of students at the University of Libya , founded ( with 33 students ) in 1956 with our help . With a group of boys picked up from the streets in Benghazi , the British in 1951 started Libya 's first trade school . It has now been taken over by the U. S. program . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 girls attend , plus loo adults in night school , and there is a long waiting list . So great is the demand for skilled workers that this school has never had a graduate from its three-year course ; all of its students have been lured into private jobs before finishing . In the hill country southwest Tripoli I visited one of the numerous health clinics , set up with U. S. but , as with all our projects there , creasingly financed by Libya . T years ago , so strong were Moslem - traditions , it was not possible to more than 30 women a week come to this clinic for prenatal a child-care instruction . The week fore I was there more than 500 come . As a result , infant mortal in this area is being steadily reduc Here also there was instructs. helped by posters and films , on h to prevent trachoma , and how it be arrested by regular use of an expensive aureomycin ointme Libya 's economic problems still grave . Discovery of oil in la quantity would , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor or suddenly becomes rich , the importance of its geography and the free world 's stake in future will not diminish . In eit case , that future will in large m ure be shaped by those yo Libyans whose chance to prep themselves for a hand in their co try 's up-building came through foreign-aid program . As in every business foreign has its mixture of failures and s cesses . But Libya is a reassuring ample of how , by intelligent spe ing , we can clearly get our mon worth .
