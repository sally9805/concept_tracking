In the off-the-record view of some of the State Department 's top hands , the most dangerous spot in the world today is Syria . What disturbs them most is the incalculable ingredient in Nikita Khrushchev 's makeup : how far this unpredictable , risk-taking Communist boss may go in foreign adventuring , to get himself out of domestic problems . Starting with this substantial concern , the U.S. last week acted with such heavy-handed zeal that even its friends in the Middle East felt compelled to react against the U.S. <P> In elaborately publicized succession , President Eisenhower proclaimed U.S. " anxiety " over the Syrian situation , U.S. fleet units churned up a show of force in Eastern Mediterranean waters , and U.S. Air Force C124 Globemasters wheeled over Amman in a display delivery of U.S. 106-mm. antitank rifles to Jordan 's army . Instead of persuading other Arab countries that the Arab nationalists of Syria were a threat to them , the U.S. display offended them and drove Syria 's neighbors to proclaim their solidarity with their Arab brothers . Within 24 hours every U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , mindful of the old Arab proverb : " My brother and I will fight my cousin , but if a stranger threatens , my brother , my cousin , and I will fight the stranger . " <P> " Serious Blunder . " Lebanon 's Foreign Minister Charles Malik , the U.S. 's staunchest friend among Arab politicians , felt compelled to announce that Lebanon opposed the use of force against Syria . That much courted Arab potentate , King Saud , passing luxuriously through Beirut en route to the waters of Baden-Baden , felt the same way , and though the State Department , in beating a later retreat , indignantly denied that King Saud had personally advised the Eisenhower Administration to take it easy , the denial was only narrowly true . <P> In fact , Charles Malik , flying to the U.S. , announced that he had been charged by his Chief of State , " in agreement with King Saud , to intervene during my visit to Washington with President Eisenhower and Mr. Dulles to obtain assurances that the U.S. will not use force in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formally connected by pact to the West , the controlled press took up the cry , as Baghdad 's Al Akhbar warned that the U.S. would commit " the most serious blunder " if it treated Syria as hostile to its neighbors . <P> Jordan 's Foreign Minister Samir Rifai , a man often assailed in the Middle East as a U.S. puppet , held a press conference in Amman , and U.S. prestige took another nose dive . The manner of the U.S. arms delivery , with U.S. Ambassador Lester Mallory and a gaggle of Jordanian notables watching from a special dais alongside the Amman airfield runway , had made an " unfortunate impression " in his country , said Rifai . " We do not feel justified , " he said , " in interfering in the internal affairs of Syria . " After routinely thanking the U.S. for the arms , he went on to suggest that they might be used by Jordan against any aggressor , including Israel .                   @ @
