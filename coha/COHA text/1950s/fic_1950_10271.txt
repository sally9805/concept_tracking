I , ROBOTand unnecessary attitude on the part of humanity . U. S Robots hit its low point , financially , just about the time I joined them in 2007 . At first , I thought my job might come to a sudden end in a matter of months , but then we simply developed the extra-Terrestrial market . " " And then you were set , of course . " " Not quite . We began by trying to adapt the models we had on hand . Those first speaking models , for instance . They were about twelve feet high , very clumsy and not much good . We sent them out to Mercury to help build the mining station there , but that failed . " I looked up in surprise , " It did ? Why , Mercury Mines is a multi-billion dollar concern .

I have n't heard from Donovan in years , but Powell is living right here in New York . He 's a grandfather now , which is a thought difficult to get used to . I can only think of him as a rather young man . Of course , I was younger , too . " I tried to keep her talking , " If you would give me the bare bones , Dr. Calvin , I can have Mr. Powell fill it in afterward . " ( And this was exactly what I later did . ) She spread her thin hands out upon the desk and looked at them . " There are two or three , " she said , " that I know a little about . " " Start with Mercury , " I suggested . " Well , I think it was in 2015 that the Second Mercury Expedition was sent out . It was exploratory and financed in part by U. S. Robots and in part by Solar Minerals . It consisted of a new-type robot , still experimental ; Gregory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gregory Powell 's favorite platitudes that nothing was to be gained from excitement ; so when Mike Donovan came leaping down the stairs toward him , red hair matted with perspiration , Powell frowned . " What 's wrong ? " he said . " Break a fingernail ? " " Yaaaah , " snarled Donovan , feverishly . " What have you been doing in the sublevels all day ? " He took a deep breath and blurted out , " Speedy never returned . " Powell 's eyes widened momentarily and he stopped on the stairs ; then he recovered and resumed his upward steps . He did n't speak until he reached the head of the flight , and then : " You sent him after the selenium ? " " Yes . " " And how long has he been out ? " " Five hours now . " Silence ! . This was a devil of a situation . Here they were , on Mercury exactly twelve hours  --  and already up to the eyebrows in the worst sort of trouble . Mercury had long been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing it rather strong  --  even for a jinx . Powell said , " Start at the beginning , and let 's get this straight . " 4142 I , ROBOT They were in the radio room now  --  with its already subtly antiquated equipment , untouched for the ten years previous to their arrival . Even ten years , technologically speaking , meant so much . Compare Speedy with the type of robot they must have had back in 2oo5 . But then , ad- vances in robotics these days were tremendous . Powell touched a still gleaming metal surface gingerly . The air of disuse that touched everything about the room  --  and the entire Station  --  was infinitely depressing . Donovan must have felt it . He began : " I tried to locate him by radio , but it was no go . Radio is n't any good on the Mercury Sunside  --  not past two miles , anyway . That 's one of the reasons the First Expedition failed . And we ca n't put up the ultrawave equipment for weeks yet  --  " " Skip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I located the unorganized body signal in the short wave . It was no good for anything except his position . I kept track of him that way for two hours and plotted the results on the map . " There was a yellowed square of parchment in his hip pocket  --  a relic of the unsuccessful First Expedition  --  and he slapped it down on the desk with vicious force , spread- ing it flat with the palm of his hand . Powell , hands clasped across his chest , watched it at long range . Donovan 's pencil pointed nervously . " The red cross is the selenium pool . You marked it yourself . " " Which one is it ? " interrupted Powell . " There were three that MacDougal located for us before he left . " " I sent Speedy to the nearest , naturally . Seventeen miles away . But what difference does that make ? " There was tension in his voice . " There are the penciled dots that mark Speedy 's position . " And for the first time Powell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the map . " Are you serious ? This is impossible . " " There it is , " growled Donovan . The little dots that marked the position formed a roughcircle about the red cross of the selenium pool . And Powell'sfingers went to his brown mustache , the unfailing signalof anxiety . Donovan added : " In the two hours I checked on him , he circled that damned pool four times . It seems likely to me that he 'll keep that up forever . Do you realize the positionwe 're in ? " Powell looked up shortly , and said nothing . Oh , yes , he realized the position they were in . It worked itself out as simply as a syllogism . The photo-cell banks that alone stood between the full power of Mercury 's monstrous sun and themselves were shot to hell . The only thing that could save them was selenium . The only thing that could get the selenium was Speedy . If Speedy did n't come back , no selenium . No selenium , no photo-cell banks . No photo-banks  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more unpleasant ways of being done in . Donovan rubbed his red mop of hair savagely and expressedhimself with bitterness . " We 'll be the laughingstockof the System , Greg . flow can everything have gone so wrong so soon ? The great team of Powell and Donovan is sent out to Mercury to report on the advisability of reopeningthe Sunside Mining Station with modern techniquesand robots and we ruin everything the first day . A purely routine job , too . We 'll never live it down . " " We wo n't have to , perhaps , " replied Powell , quietly . " If we do n't do something quickly , living anything downoreven just plain living  --  will be out of the question . " " Do n't be stupid ! If you feel funny about it , Greg , I do n't . It was criminal , sending us out here with only one robot . And it was your bright idea that we could handle the photo-bank cells ourselves . " " Now you 're being unfair .

What the devil ! We could n't have waited for next conjunction . " " Well , what are we going to do ? Powell , you 've got an idea . I know you have , or you would n't be so calm . You 're no more a hero than I am . Go on , spill it ! " " We ca n't go after Speedy ourselves , Mike  --  not on the Sunside . Even the new insosuits are n't good for more than twenty minutes in direct sunlight . But you know the old saying , Set a robot to catch a robot . ' Look , Mike , maybe things are n't so bad . We 've got six robots down in the sublevels , that we may be able to use , if they work . If they work . " There was a glint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six robots from the First Expedition . Are you sure ? They may be subrobotic machines . Ten years is a long time as far as robot-types are concerned , you know . " " No , they 're robots . I 've spent all day with them and I know . They 've got positronic brains : primitive , of course . " He placed the map in his pocket . " Let 's go down . " The robots were on the lowest sublevel  --  all six of them surrounded by musty packing cases of uncertain content . They were large , extremely so , and even though they were in a sitting position on the floor , legs straddled out before them , their heads were a good seven feet in the air . Donovan whistled . " Look at the size of them , will you ? The chests must be ten feet around . " " That 's because they 're supplied with the old McGuffy gears . I 've been over the insides  --  crummiest set you 've ever seen . " " Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any reason to . I do n't think there 's anything wrong with them . Even the diaphragm is in reasonableorder . They might talk . " He had unscrewed the chest plate of the nearest as he spoke , inserted the two-inch sphere that contained the tinyspark of atomic energy that was a robot 's life . There was difficulty in fitting it , but he managed , and then screwed the plate back on again in laborious fashion . The radio controls of more modern models had not been heard of ten years earlier . And then to the other five . Donovan said uneasily , " They have n't moved . " " No orders to do so , " replied Powell , succinctly . He went back to the first in the line and struck him on the chest . " You ! Do you hear me ? " The monster 's head bent slowly , and the eyes fixed themselves on Powell . Then , in a harsh , squawking voice  --  like that of a medieval phonograph , he grated , " Yes , Master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get that ? Those were the days of the first talking robots when it looked as if the use of Robots on Earth would be banned . The makers were fighting that and they built good , healthy slave complexes into the damned machines . " " It did n't help them , " muttered Donovan . " No , it did n't , but they sure tried . " He turned once more to the robot . " Get up ! " The robot towered upward slowly and Donovan 's head craned and his puckered lips whistled . Powell said : " Can you go out upon the surface ? In the light ? " There was consideration while the robot 's slow brain worked . Then , " Yes , Master . " " Good . Do you know what a mile is ? " Another consideration , and another slow answer . " Yes , Master . " " We will take you up to the surface then , and indicate a direction . You will go about seventeen miles , and somewhere in that general region you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand so far ? " " Yes , Master . " " You will find this robot and order him to return . If he does not wish to , you are to bring him back by force . " 46 I , ROBOT Donovan clutched at Powell 's sleeve . " Why not send him for the selenium direct ? " " Because I want Speedy back , nitwit . I want to find out what 's wrong with him . " And to the robot , " All right , you , follow me . " The robot remained motionless and his voice rumbled : " Pardon , Master , but I can not . You must mount first . " his clumsy arms had come together with a thwack , blunt fingers interlacing . Powell stared and then pinched at his mustache . " Uh .. oh ! " Donovan 's eyes bulged . " We 've got to ride him ? Like a horse ? " " I guess that 's the idea . I do n't know why , though . I ca n't see  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing up robot-safety in those days . Evidently , they were going to sell the notion of safety by riot allowing them to move about , without a mahout on their shoulders all the time . What do we do now ? " " That 's what I 've been thinking , " muttered Donovan . " We ca n't go out on the surface , with a robot or without . Oh , for the love of Pete "  --  and he snapped his fingers twice . He grew excited . " Give me that map you 've got . I have n't studied it for two hours for nothing . This is a Mining Station . What 's wrong with using the tunnels ? " The Mining Station was a black circle on the map , and the light dotted lines that were tunnels stretched out about it in spiderweb fashion . 1 Donovan studied the list of symbols at the bottom of the map . " Look , " he said , " the small black dots are open- ings to the surface , and here 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a number here  --  you 'd think they 'd write larger-13a . If the robots know their way around here  --  " Powell shot the question and received the dull " Yes , Master , " in reply . " Get your insosuit , " he said with satis- faction . It was the first time either had worn the insosuitswhichmarked one time more than either had expected to upon their arrival the day before  --  and they tested their limb movements uncomfortably . The insosuit was far bulkier and far uglier than the regulationspacesuit ; but withal considerably lighter , due to the fact that they were entirely nonmetallic in composition . Composed of heat-resistant plastic and chemically treated cork layers , and equipped with a desiccating unit to keep the air bone-dry , the insosuits could withstand the full glare of Mercury 's sun for twenty minutes . Five to ten minutes more , as well , without actually killing the occupant . And still the robot 's ' hands formed the stirrup , nor did he betray the slightest atom of surprise at the grotesque figure into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boomed out : " Are you ready to take us to Exit 13a ? " " Yes , Master . " Good , thought Powell ; they might lack radio control but at least they were fitted for radio reception . " Mount one or the other , Mike , " he said to Donovan . He placed a foot in the improvised stirrup and swung upward . He found the seat comfortable ; there was the humped back of the robot , evidently shaped for the purpose , a shallow groove along each shoulder for the thighs and two elongated " ears " whose purpose now seemed obvious . Powell seized the ears and twisted the head . His mount turned ponderously . " Lead on Macduff . " But he did not feel at all lighthearted . The gigantic robots moved slowly , with mechanical precision , through the doorway that cleared their heads by a scant foot , so that the two men had to duck hurriedly , along a narrow corridor in which their unhurried footsteps boomed monotonously and into the air lock . The long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBOTfore them brought home forcefully to Powell the exact magnitude of the task accomplished by the First Expedition , with their crude robots and their start-from-scratch necessities . They might have been a failure , but their failurewas a good deal better than the usual run of the System'ssuccesses . The robots plodded onward with a pace that never variedand with footsteps that never lengthened . Powell said : " Notice that these tunnels are blazing with lights and that the temperature is Earth-normal . It 's probablybeen like this all the ten years that this place has remainedempty . " How 's that ? " " Cheap energy ; cheapest in the System . Sunpower , you know , and on Mercury 's Sunside , sunpower is something . That 's why the Station was built in the sunlight rather than in the shadow of a mountain . It 's really a huge energyconverter . The heat is turned into electricity , light , mechanical work and what have you ; so that energy is suppliedand the Station is cooled in a simultaneous process . " " Look , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but would you mind changing the subject ? It so happens that this conversion of energy that you talk about is carried on by the photo-cell banks mainly  --  and that is a tender subjectwith me at the moment . " Powell grunted vaguely , and when Donovan broke the resulting silence , it was to change the subject completely . " Listen , Greg . What the devil 's wrong with Speedy , anyway ? I ca n't understand it . " It 's not easy to shrug shoulders in an insosuit , but Powelltried it . " I do n't know , Mike . You know he 's perfectly adapted to a Mercurian environment . Heat does n't mean anything to him and he 's built for the light gravity and the broken ground . He 's foolproof  --  or , at least , he should be . " Silence fell . This time , silence that lasted . " Master , " said the robot , " we are here . " " Eh ? " Powell snapped out of a semidrowse . " Well , get us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They found themselves in a tiny substation , empty , airless , ruined . Donovan had inspected a jagged hole in the upper reaches of one of the walls by the light of his pocket flash . " Meteorite , do you suppose ? " he had asked . Powell shrugged . " To hell with that . It does n't matter . Let 's get out . " A towering cliff of a black , basaltic rock cut off the sunlight , and the deep night shadow of an airless world surroundedthem . Before them , the shadow reached out and ended in knife-edge abruptness into an all-but-unbearable blaze of white light , that glittered from myriad crystals along a rocky ground . " Space ! " gasped Donovan . " It looks like snow . " And it did . Powell 's eyes swept the jagged glitter of Mercury to the horizon and winced at the gorgeous brilliance . " This must be an unusual area , " he said . " The general albedo of Mercury is low and most of the soil is gray pumice . Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? " He was thankful for the light filters in their visiplates . Beautiful or not , a look at the sunlight through straight glass would have blinded them inside of half a minute . Donovan was looking at the spring thermometer on his wrist . " Holy smokes , the temperature is eighty centi-grade ! " Powell checked his own and said : " Um-m-m . A little high . Atmosphere , you know . " " On Mercury ? Are you nuts ? " " Mercury is n't really airless , " explained Powell , in absent-mindedfashion . He was adjusting the binocular attachmentsto his visiplate , and the bloated fingers of the50 I , ROBOT insosuit were clumsy at it . " There is a thin exhalation that clings to its surface  --  vapors of the more volatile ele- ments and compounds that are heavy enough for Mer- curian gravity to retain . You know : selenium , iodine , mercury , gallium , potassium , bismuth , volatile oxides . The vapors sweep into the shadows and condense , giving up heat . Its a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use your flash , you 'll probably find that the side of the cliff is covered with , say , hoar-sulphur , or maybe quicksilver dew . " It does n't matter , though . Our suits can stand a measly eighty indefinitely . " Powell had adjusted the binocular attachments , so that he seemed as eye stalked as a snail . Donovan watched tensely . " See anything ? " The other did not answer immediately , and when he did , his voice was anxious and thoughtful . " There 's a dark spot on the horizon that might be the selenium pool . It 's in the right place . But I do n't see Speedy . Powell clambered upward in an instinctive striving for better view , till he was standing in unsteady fashion upon his robot 's shoulders . Legs straddled wide , eyes straining , he said : " I think ... I think  --  Yes , it 's definitely he . He 's corning this way . " Donovan followed the pointing finger . He had no bin- oculars , but there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the crystalline ground . " I see him , " he yelled . " Let 's get going ! " Powell had hopped down into a sitting position on the robot again , and his suited hand slapped against the Gar gantuan 's barrel chest . " Get going ! " " Giddy-ap , " yelled Donovan , and thumped his heels , spur fashion . The robots started off , the regular thudding of their footsteps silent in the airlessness , for the nonmetallic fab- ric of the insosuits did not transmit sound . There was only a rhythmic vibration just below the border of actual hearing . " Faster , " yelled Donovan . The rhythm did not change . " No use , " cried Powell , in reply . " These junk heaps are only geared to one speed . Do you think they 're equipped with selective flexors ? " They had burst through the shadow , and the sunlight came down in a white-hot wash and poured liquidly about them . Donovan ducked involuntarily . " Wow ! Is it imaginationor do I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was the grim reply . " Keep your eye on Speedy . " Robot SPD 13 was near enough to be seen in detail now . His graceful , streamlined body threw out blazing highlights as he loped with easy speed across the broken ground . His name was derived from his serial initials , of course , but it was apt , nevertheless , for the SPD models were among the fastest robots turned out by the United States Robot &; Mechanical Men Corp . " Hey , Speedy , " howled Donovan , and waved a frantic hand . " Speedy ! " shouted Powell . " Come here ! " The distance between the men and the errant robot was being cut down momentarily  --  more by the efforts of Speedy than the slow plodding of the fifty-year-old antique mounts of Donovan and Powell . They were close enough now to notice that Speedy 's gait included a peculiar rolling stagger , a noticeable side-to-side lurch  --  and then , as Powell waved his hand again and sent maximum juice into his compact head-set radio sender , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw them . Speedy hopped to a halt and remained standing for a moment  --  with just a tiny , unsteady weave , as though he were swaying in a light wind . Powell yelled : " All right , Speedy . Come here , boy . " 52 I , ROBOT RUNAROUND 53Whereupon Speedy 's robot voice sounded in Powell 's earphones for the first time . It said : " Hot dog , let 's play games . You catch me and I catch you ; no love can cut our knife in two . For I 'm LittleButtercup , sweet Little Buttercup . Whoops ! " Turning on his heel , he sped off in the direction from which he had come , with a speed and fury that kicked up gouts of baked dust . And his last words as he receded into the distance were , " There grew a little flower ' neath a great oak tree , " followed by a curious metallic clicking that might have been a robotic equivalent of a hiccup . Donovan said weakly : " Where did he pick up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . he 's drunk or some-thing . " " If you had n't told me , " was the bitter response , " I 'd never realize it . Let 's get back to the cliff . I 'm roasting . It was Powell who broke the desperate silence . " In the first place , " he said , " Speedy is n't drunk  --  not in the humansense  --  because he 's a robot , and robots do n't get drunk . However , there 's something wrong with him which is the robotic equivalent of drunkenness . " " To me , he 's drunk , " stated Donovan , emphatically , " and all I know is that he thinks we 're playing games . And we 're not . It 's a matter of life and very gruesome death . " " All right . Do n't hurry me . A robot 's only a robot . Once we find out what 's wrong with him , we can fix it and go on . " " Once , " said Donovan , sourly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal Mercurian environment . But this region "  --  and his arm swept wide  --  " is definitely abnormal . There 's our clue . Now where do these crystals come from ? They might have formed from a slowly cooling liquid ; but where would you get liquid so hot that it would cool in Mercury 's sun ? " " Volcanic action , " suggested Donovan , instantly , and Powell 's body tensed . " Out of the mouths of sucklings , " he said in a small , strange voice , and remained very still for five minutes . Then , he said , " Listen , Mike , what did you say to Speedy when you sent him after the selenium ? " Donovan was taken aback . " Well , damn it  --  I do n't know . I just told him to get it . " " Yes , I know . But how ? Try to remember the exact words . " " I said . . . uh . . . I said : Speedy , we need some selenium . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' That 's all . What more did you want me to say ? " " You did n't put any urgency into the order , did you ? " " What for ? It was pure routine . " Powell sighed . " Well , it ca n't be helped now  --  but we 're in a fine fix . " He had dismounted from his robot , and was sitting , back against the cliff . Donovan joined him and they linked arms . In the distance the burning sunlight seemed to wait cat-and-mouse for them , and just next them , the two giant robots were invisible but for the dull red of their photoelectric eyes that stared down at them , unblinking , unwavering and unconcerned . Unconcerned ! As was all this poisonous Mercury , as large in jinx as it was small in size . Powell 's radio voice was tense in Donovan 's ear : " Now , look , let 's start with the three fundamental Rules of Robotics  --  the three rules that are built most deeply into a robot 's positronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off each point . " We have : One , a robot may not injure a human being , or , through inaction , allow a human being to come to harm . " " Right ! " " Two , " continued Powell , " a robot must obey the ordersgiven it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law . " 54 I , ROBOT " Right ! " " And three , a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Laws . " " Right ! Now where are we ? " " Exactly at the explanation . The conflict between the various rules is ironed out by the different positronic po- tentials in the brain . We 'll say that a robot is walking into danger and knows it . The automatic potential that Rule 3 sets up turns him back . But suppose you order him to walk into that danger . In that case , Rule 2 sets up a counterpotential higher than the previous one and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I know that . What about it ? " " Let 's take Speedy 's case . Speedy is one of the latest models , extremely specialized , and as expensive as a battle- ship . It 's not a thing to be lightly destroyed . " " So ? " " So Rule 3 has been strengthened  --  that was specifically mentioned , by the way , in the advance notices on the SPD models  --  so that his allergy to danger is unusually high . At the same time , when you sent him out after the sele- nium , you gave him his order casually and without special emphasis , so that the Rule 2 potential set-up was rather weak . Now , hold on ; I 'm just stating facts . " " All right , go ahead . I think I get it . " " You see how it works , do n't you ? There 's some sort of danger centering at the selenium pool . It increases as he approaches , and at a certain distance from it the Rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balances the Rule 2 potential , unusually low to start with . " Donovan rose to his feet in excitement . " And it strikes an equilibrium . I see . Rule 3 drives him back and Rule 2 drives him forward  --  " " So he follows a circle around the selenium pool , staying on the locus of all points of potential equilibrium . And unless we do something about it , he 'll stay on that circle forever , giving us the good old runaround . " Then , more thoughtfully : " And that , by the way , is what makes him drunk . At potential equilibrium , half the positronic paths of his brain are out of kilter . I 'm not a robot specialist , but that seems obvious . Probably he 's lost control of just those parts of his voluntary mechanism that a human drunk has . Ve-e-ery pretty . " " But what 's the danger ? If we knew what he was runningfrom  --  " " You suggested it . Volcanic action . Somewhere right above the selenium pool is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dioxide , carbon dioxide  --  and carbonmonoxide . Lots of it  --  and at this temperature . " Donovan gulped audibly . " Carbon monoxide plus iron gives the volatile iron carbonyl . " " And a robot , " added Powell , " is essentially iron . " Then , grimly : " There 's nothing like deduction . We 've determinedeverything about our problem but the solution . We ca n't get the selenium ourselves . It 's still too far . ' We ca n't send these robot horses , because they ca n't go themselves , and they ca n't carry us fast enough to keep us from crisping . And we ca n't catch Speedy , because the dope thinks we 're playing games , and he can run sixty miles to our four . " " If one of us goes , " began Donovan , tentatively , " and comes back cooked , there 'll still be the other . " " Yes , " came the sarcastic reply , " it would be a most tendersacrifice  --  except that a person would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool , and I do n't think the robots would ever turn back to the cliff without orders . Figure it out ! We 're two or three miles from the pool  --  call it two  --  the robot travels at four miles an hour ; and we can last twenty minutes in our suits . It is n't only the heat , remember . Solar radiation out here in the ultraviolet and below is poison . " " Urn-m-m , " said Donovan , " ten minutes short . " " As good as an eternity . And another thing . In order56 I , ROBOT for Rule 3 potential to have stopped Speedy where it did , there must be an appreciable amount of carbon monoxide in the metal-vapor atmosphere  --  and there must be an ap- preciable corrosive action therefore . He 's been out hours now  --  and how do we know when a knee joint , for in- stance , wo n't be thrown out of kilter and keel him over . It 's not only a question of thinking  --  we 've got to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismal silence ! Donovan broke it , voice trembling in an effort to keep itself emotionless . He said : " As long as we ca n't increase Rule a potential by giving further orders , how about work- ing the other way ? If we increase the danger , we increase Rule 3 potential and drive him backward . " Powell 's visiplate had turned toward him in a silent question . " You see , " came the cautious explanation , " all we need to do to drive him out of his rut is to increase the concen- tration of carbon monoxide in his vicinity . Well , back at the Station there 's a complete analytical laboratory . " " Naturally , " assented Powell . " It 's a mining station . " " All right . There must be pounds of oxalic acid for cal- cium precipitations . " " Holy space ! Mike , you 're a genius . " " So-so , " admitted Donovan , modestly . " It 's just a case of remembering that oxalic acid on heating decomposes into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . College chem , you know . " Powell was on his feet and had attracted the attention of one of the monster robots by the simple expedient of pounding the machine 's thigh . " Hey , " he shouted , " can you throw ? " " Master ? " " Never mind . " Powell damned the robot 's molasses- slow brain . He scrabbled up a jagged brick-size rock . " Take this , " he said , " and hit the patch of bluish crystals just across that crooked fissure . You see it ? " Donovan pulled at his shoulder . " Too far , Greg . It 's almost half a mile off . " " Quiet , " replied Powell . " It 's a case of Mercurian gravityand a steel throwing arm . Watch , will you ? " The robot 's eyes were measuring the distance with machinelyaccurate stereoscopy . His arm adjusted itself to the weight of the missile and drew back . In the darkness , the robot 's motions went unseen , but there was a sudden thumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock flew blackly into the sunlight . There was no air resistance to slow it down , nor wind to turn it aside  --  and when it hit the ground it threw up crystals precisely in the center of the " blue patch . " Powell yelled happily and shouted , " Let 's go back after the oxalic acid , Mike . " And as they plunged into the ruined substation on the way back to the tunnels , Donovan said grimly : " Speedy 's been hanging about on this side of the selenium pool , ever since we chased after him . Did you see him ? " " Yes . " " I guess he wants to play games . Well , we 'll play him games ! " They were back hours later , with three-liter jars of the white chemical and a pair of long faces . The photo-cell banks were deteriorating more rapidly than had seemed likely . The two steered their robots into the sunlight and toward the waiting Speedy in silence and with grim purpose . Speedy galloped slowly toward them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a little list , the piano organist ; all people who eat peppermint and puff it in your face . " " We 'll puff something in your face , " muttered Donovan . " He 's limping , Greg . " " I noticed that , " came the low , worried response . " The monoxide 'll get him yet , if we do n't hurry . " They were approaching cautiously now , almost sidling , 58 I , ROBOT RUNAROUND 59to refrain from setting off the thoroughly irrational robot . Powell was too far off to tell , of course , but even already he could have sworn the crack-brained Speedy was setting himself for a spring . " Let her go , " he gasped . " Count three ! One  --  two  --  " Two steel arms drew back and snapped forward simultaneouslyand two glass jars whirled forward in towering parallel arcs , gleaming like diamonds in the impossible sun . And in a pair of soundless puffs , they hit the ground behindSpeedy in crashes that sent the oxalic acid flying like dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powell knew it was fizzing like soda water . Speedy turned to stare , then backed away from it slowly  --  and as slowly gathered speed . In fifteen seconds , he was leaping directly toward the two humans in an unsteady canter . Powell did not get Speedy 's words just then , though he heard something that resembled , " Lover 's professions when uttered in Hessians . " He turned away . " Back to the cliff , Mike . He 's out of the rut and he 'll be taking orders now . I 'm getting hot . " They jogged toward the shadow at the slow monotonous pace of their mounts , and it was not until they had entered it and felt the sudden coolness settle softly about them that Donovan looked back . " Greg ! " Powell looked and almost shrieked . Speedy was moving slowly now  --  so slowly  --  and in the wrong direction . He was drifting ; drifting back into his rut ; and he was picking up speed . He looked dreadfully close , and dreadfully unreachable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ! " and thumped his robot into its pace , but Powell called him back . " You wo n't catch him , Mike  --  it 's no use . " He fidgeted on his robot 's shoulders and clenched his fist in tight impotence . " Why the devil do I see these things five seconds after it 's all over ? Mike , we 've wasted hours . " " We need more oxalic acid , " declared Donovan , stolidly . " The concentration was n't high enough . " " Seven tons of it would n't have been enough  --  and we have n't the hours to spare to get it , even if it were , with the monoxide chewing him away . Do n't you see what it is , Mike ? " And Donovan said flatly , " No . " " We were only establishing new equilibriums . When we create new monoxide and increase Rule 3 potential , he moves backward till he 's in balance again  --  and when the monoxide drifted away , he moved forward , and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretched . " It 's the same old runaround . We can push at Rule 2 and pull at Rule 3 and we ca n't get anywhere  --  we can only change the position of balance . We 've got to get outside both rules . " And then he pushed his robot closer to Donovan 's so that they were sitting face to face , dim shadows in the darkness , and he whispered , " Mike ! " " Is it the finish ? "  --  dully . " I suppose we go back to the Station , wait for the banks to fold , shake hands , take cyanide , and go out like gentlemen . " He laughed shortly . " Mike , " repeated Powell earnestly , " we 've got to get Speedy . " " I know . " " Mirie , " once more , and Powell hesitated before continuing . " There 's always Rule i . I thought of it  --  earlier  --  but it 's desperate . " Donovan looked up and his voice livened . " We 're des-perate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a robot ca n't see a human come to harm because of his own inaction . Two and 3 ca n't stand against it . They ca n't , Mike . " Even when the robot is half era  --  Well , he 's drunk . You know he is. " 60 I , ROBOT RUNAROUND 61 " It 's the chances you take . " " Cut it . What are you going to do ? " " I 'm going out there now and see what Rule i will do . If it wo n't break the balance , then what the devil  --  it 's either now or three-four days from now . " " Hold on , Greg . There are human rules of behavior , too . You do n't go out there just like that . Figure out a lottery , and give me my chance . " " All right . First to get the cube of fourteen goes . " And almost immediately , " Twenty-seven forty-four ! " Donovan felt his robot stagger at a sudden push by Powell 's mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened his mouth to shout , and then clicked it shut . Of course , the damn fool had worked out the cube of fourteen in advance , and on purpose . Just like him . The sun was hotter than ever and Powell felt a maddeningitch in the small of his back . Imagination , probably , or perhaps hard radiation beginning to tell even through the insosuit . Speedy was watching him , without a word of Gilbert and Sullivan gibberish as greeting . Thank God for that ! But he dare n't get too close . He was three hundred yards away when Speedy began backing , a step at a time , cautiously  --  and Powell stopped . IIe jumped from his robot 's shoulders and landed on the crystalline ground with a light thump and a flying of jagged fragments . He proceeded on foot , the ground gritty and slippery to his steps , the low gravity causing him difficulty . The soles of his feet tickled with warmth . He cast one glance over his shoulder at the blackness of the cliff 's shadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either by himself or by the help of his antique robot . It was Speedy or nothingnow , and the knowledge of that constricted his chest . Far enough ! He stopped . " Speedy , " he called . " Speedy ! " The sleek , modern robot ahead of him hesitated and halted his backward steps , then resumed them . Powell tried to put a note of pleading into his voice , and found it did n't take much acting . " Speedy , I 've got to get back to the shadow or the sun 'll get me . It 's life or death , Speedy . I need you . " Speedy took one step forward and stopped . He spoke , but at the sound Powell groaned , for it was , " When you 're lying awake with a dismal headache and repose is tabooed  --  " It trailed off there , and Powell took time out for some reason to murmur , " Iolanthe . " It was roasting hot ! He caught a movement out of the corner of his eye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the monstrous robot on which he had ridden was moving  --  moving toward him , and without a rider . He was talking : " Pardon , Master . I must not move without a Master upon me , but you are in danger . " Of course , Rule i potential above everything . But he did n't want that clumsy antique ; he wanted Speedy . He walked away and motioned frantically : " I order you to stay away . I order you to stop ! " It was quite useless . You could not beat Rule i potential . The robot said stupidly , " You are in danger , Master . " Powell looked about him desperately . He could n't see clearly . His brain was in a heated whirl ; his breath scorched when he breathed , and the ground all about him was a shimmering haze . He called a last time , desperately : " Speedy ! I 'm dying , damn you ! Where are you ? Speedy , I need you . " He was still stumbling backward in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't want , when he felt steel fingers on his arms , and a worried , apologetic voice of metallic timbre in his ears . " Holy smokes , boss , what are you doing here ? And what am I doing  --  I 'm so confused  --  " " Never mind , " murmured Powell , weakly . " Get mete , i62 I , ROBOTthe shadow of the cliff  --  and hurry ! " There was one last feeling of being lifted into the air and a sensation of rapid motion and burning heat , and he passed out . He woke with Donovan bending over him and smiling anxiously . " I low arc you , Greg ? " " Fine ! " came the response . " Where 's Speedy ? " " Right here . I sent him out to one of the other selenium pools  --  with orders to get that selenium at all cost this time . He got it back in forty-two minutes and three seconds . I timed him . He still has n't finished apologizing for the runaround he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fear of what you 'll say . " " Drag him over , " ordered Powell . " It was n't his fault . " He held out a hand and gripped Speedy 's metal paw . " It 's O.K. , Speedy . " Then , to Donovan , " You know , Mike , I was just thinking  --  " " Yes ! " " Well , "  --  he rubbed his face  --  the air was so delightfullycool , " you know that when we get things set up here and Speedy put through his Field Tests , they 're going to send us to the Space Stations next  --  " " No ! " " Yes ! At least that 's what old lady Calvin told me just before we left , and I did n't say anything about it , because I was going to fight the whole idea . " " Fight it ? " cried Donovan . " But  --  " " I know . It 's all right with me now . Two hundred seventy-threedegrees Centigrade below zero . Wo n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Donovan , " here I come . " HALF A year later , the boys had changed their mind . The flame of a giant sun had given way to the soft blackness of space but external variations mean little in the business of checking the workings of experimental robots . Whatever the background , one is face to face with an inscrutable positronic brain , which the slide-rule geniusessay should work thus-and-so . Except that they do n't . Powell and Donovan found that out after they had been on the Station less than two weeks . Gregory Powell spaced his words for emphasis , " One week ago , Donovan and I put you together . " His brows furrowed doubtfully and he pulled the end of his brown mustache . It was quiet in the officer 's room of Solar Station #5-except for the soft purring of the mighty Beam Director somewhere far below . Robot OT-1 sat immovable . The burnished plates of his body gleamed in the Luxites and the glowing red of the photoelectric cells that were his eyes , were fixed steadily upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Powell repressed a sudden attack of nerves . These robots possessed peculiar brains . Oh , the three Laws of Robotics63THREEREASON64 I , ROBOTheld . They had to . All of U. S. Robots , from Robertson himself to the new floor-sweeper would insist on that . So OT-r was safe ! And yet  --  the QT models were the first of their kind , and this was the first of the OT 's . Mathematicalsquiggles on paper were not always the most comforting protection against robotic fact . Finally , the robot spoke . His voice carried the cold timbreinseparable from a metallic diaphragm , " Do you realizethe seriousness of such a statement , Powell ? " " Something made you , Cutie , " pointed out Powell . " You admit yourself that your memory seems to spring full-grown from an absolute blankness of a week ago . I 'm giving you the explanation . Donovan and I put you togetherfrom the parts shipped us . " Cutie gazed upon his long , supple fingers in an oddly human attitude of mystification , " It strikes me that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For you to make me seems improbable . The Earthman laughed quite suddenly , " In Earth 's name , why ? " " Call it intuition . That 's all it is so far . But I intend to reason it out , though . A chain of valid reasoning can end only with the determination of truth , and I 'll stick till I get there . " Powell stood up and seated himself at the table 's edge next the robot . lie felt a sudden strong sympathy for this strange machine . It was not at all like the ordinary robot , attending to his specialized task at the station with the - intensity of a deeply ingrooved positronic path . He placed a hand upon Cutie 's steel shoulder and the metal was cold and hard to the touch . " Cutie , " he said , " I 'm going to try to explain something to you . You 're the first robot who 's ever exhibited curiosityas to his own existence  --  and I think the first that 's really intelligent enough to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " REASON 65The robot rose erect smoothly and his thickly spongerubbersoled feet made no noise as he followed Powell . The Earthman touched a button and a square section of the wall flickered aside . The thick , clear glass revealed space  --  star-speckled . " I 've seen that in the observation ports in the engine room , " said Cutie . " I know , " said Powell . " What do you think it is ? " " Exactly what it seems  --  a black material just beyond this glass that is spotted with little gleaming dots . I know that our director sends out beams to some of these dots , always to the same ones  --  and also that these dots shift and that the beams shift with them . That is all . " " Good ! Now I want you to listen carefully . The blacknessis emptiness  --  vast emptiness stretching out infinitely . The little , gleaming dots are huge masses of energy-filled matter . They are globes , some of them millions of miles in diameter  --  and for comparison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tiny because they are incredibly far off . " The dots to which our energy beams are directed , are nearer and much smaller . They are cold and hard and humanbeings like myself live upon their surfaces  --  many billions of them . It is from one of these worlds that Donovanand I come . Our beams feed these worlds energy drawn from one of those huge incandescent globes that happens to be near us . We call that globe the Sun and it is on the other side of the station where you ca n't see it . " Cutie remained motionless before the port , like a steel statue . His head did not turn as he spoke , " Which particulardot of light do you claim to come from ? " Powell searched , " There it is . The very bright one in the corner . We call it Earth . " He grinned , " Good old Earth . There are three billions of us there , Cutie  --  and in about two weeks I 'll be back there with them . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no tune to it , but it possessed a curious twanging quality as of plucked strings . It ceased as sud denly as it had begun , " But where do I come in , Powell : You have n't explained my existence . " " The rest is simple . When these stations were first es tablished to feed solar energy to the planets , they were rur by humans . However , the heat , the hard solar radiations and the electron storms made the post a difficult one . Ro bots were developed to replace human labor and now onl , two human executives are required for each station . Wf arc trying to replace even those , and that 's where you com ( in . You 're the highest type robot ever developed and if yoc show the ability to run this station independently , no hu . man need ever come here again except to bring parts foi repairs . " His hand went up and the metal visi-lid snapped back into place . Powell returned to the table and polished an apple upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the robot 's eyes held him . " Do you expect me , " said Cutie slowly , " to believe any such complicated , implausible hypothesis as you have just outlined ? What do you take me for ? " Powell sputtered apple fragments onto the table and turned red . " Why , damn you , it was n't a hypothesis . Those were facts . " Cutie sounded grim , " Globes of energy millions of miles across ! Worlds with three billion humans on them ! Infinite emptiness ! Sorry , Powell , but I do n't believe it . I 'll puzzle this thing out for myself . Good-by . " He turned and stalked out of the room . He brushed past Michael Donovan on the threshold with a grave nod and passed down the corridor , oblivious to the astounded stare that followed him . Mike Donovan rumpled his red hair and shot an annoyed glance at Powell , " What was that walking junk yard talkingabout ? What does n't he believe ? " The other dragged at his mustache bitterly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He does n't believe we made him or that Earth exists or space or stars . " " Sizzling Saturn , we 've got a lunatic robot on our hands . " " He says he 's going to figure it all out for himself . " " Well , now , " said Donovan sweetly , " I do hope he 'll condescend to explain it all to me after he 's puzzled everything out . " Then , with sudden rage , " Listen ! If that metal mess gives me any lip like that , I 'll knock that chromium cranium right off its torso . " He seated himself with a jerk and drew a paper-backed mystery novel out of his inner jacket pocket , " That robot gives me the willies anyway  --  too damned inquisitive ! " Mike Donovan growled from behind a huge **25;5510;TOOLONG as Cutie knocked gently and entered . " Is Powell here ? " Donovan 's voice was muffled , with pauses for mastication , " He 's gathering data on electronic stream functions . We 're heading for a storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke , eyes on the graphed paper in his hands and dropped into a chair . He spread the sheets out before him and began scribbling calculations . Donovan stared over his shoulder , crunching lettuce and dribbling bread crumbs . Cutie waited silently . Powell looked up , " The Zeta Potential is rising , but slowly . Just the same , the Stream Functions are erratic and I do n't know what to expect . Oh , hello , Cutie . I thought you were supervising the installation of the new drive bar . " " It 's done , " said the robot , quietly , " and so I 've come to have a talk with the two of you . " " Oh ! " Powell looked uncomfortable . " Well , sit down . No , not that chair . One of the legs is weak and you 're no lightweight . " The robot did so and said placidly , " I have come to a decision . " 68 1 , ROBOTDonovan glowered and put the remnants of his sandwich aside . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other motioned impatiently for silence , " Go ahead , Cutie . We 're listening . " " I have spent these last two days in concentrated introspection , " said Cutie , " and the results have been most interesting . I began at the one sure assumption I felt permitted to make . I , myself , exist , because I think  --  " Powell groaned , " Oh , Jupiter , a robot Descartes ! " " Who 's Descartes ? " demanded Donovan . " Listen , do we have to sit here and listen to this metal maniac  --  " " Keep quiet , Mike ! " Cutie continued imperturbably , " And the question that immediately arose was : Just what is the cause of my exist- I ence ? " Powell 's jaw set lumpily . " You 're being foolish . I told you already that we made you . " " And if you do n't believe us , " added Donovan , " we 'll gladly take you apart ! " The robot spread his strong hands in a deprecatory gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be backed by reason , or else it is worthless  --  and it goes against all the dictates of logic to suppose that you made me . " Powell dropped a restraining arm upon Donovan 's suddenlybunched fist . " Just why do you say that ? " Cutie laughed . It was a very inhuman laugh  --  the most machinelike utterance he had yet given vent to . It was sharp and explosive , as regular as a metronome and as uninflected . " Look at you , " he said finally . " I say this in no spirit of contempt , but look at you ! The material you are made of is soft and flabby , lacking endurance and strength , dependingfor energy upon the inefficient oxidation of organic material  --  like that . " He pointed a disapproving finger at what remained of Donovan 's sandwich . " Periodically you pass into a coma and the least variation in temperature , REASON 69air pressure , humidity , or radiation intensity impairs your efficiency . You are makeshift . " I , on the other hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly and utilize it with almost one hundred percent efficiency . I am composed of strong metal , am continuously conscious , and can stand extremes of environmenteasily . These are facts which , with the selfevidentproposition that no being can create another being superior to itself , smashes your silly hypothesis to nothing . " Donovan 's muttered curses rose into intelligibility as he sprang to his feet , rusty eyebrows drawn low . " All right , you son of a hunk of iron ore , if we did n't make you , who did ? " Cutie nodded gravely . " Very good , Donovan . That was indeed the next question . Evidently my creator must be more powerful than myself and so there was only one pos-sibility . " The Earthmen looked blank and Cutie continued , " What is the center of activities here in the station ? What do we all serve ? What absorbs all our attention ? " He waited expectantly . Donovan turned a startled look upon his companion . " I 'll bet this tin-plated screwball is talking about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " grinned Powell . " I am talking about the Master , " came the cold , sharp answer . It was the signal for a roar of laughter from Donovan , and Powell himself dissolved into a half-suppressed giggle . Cutie had risen to his feet and his gleaming eyes passed from one Earthman to the other . " It is so just the same and I do n't wonder that you refuse to believe . You two are not long to stay here , I 'm sure . Powell himself said that at first only men served the Master ; that there followed robots for the routine work ; and , finally , myself for the70 I , ROBOTexecutive labor . The facts are no doubt true , but the explanationentirely illogical . Do you want the truth behind it all ? " " Go ahead , Cutie . You 're amusing . " " The Master created humans first as the lowest type , most easily formed . Gradually , he replaced them by robots , the next higher step , and finally he created me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on , I serve the Mas-ter . " " You 'll do nothing of the sort , " said Powell sharply . " You 'll follow our orders and keep quiet , until we 're satisfiedthat you can run the Converter . Get that ! The Converter  --  not the Master . If you do n't satisfy us , you will be dismantled . And now  --  if you do n't mind  --  you can leave . And take this data with you and file it properly . " Cutie accepted the graphs handed him and left without another word . Donovan leaned back heavily in his chair and shoved thick fingers through his hair . " There 's going to be trouble with that robot . He 's pure nuts ! " The drowsy hum of the Converter is louder in the controlroom and mixed with it is the chuckle of the Geiger Counters and the erratic buzzing of half a dozen little signal lights . Donovan withdrew his eye from the telescope and flashed the Luxites on . " The beam from Station $$4 caught Mars on schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstractedly . " Cutie 's down in the engineroom . I 'll flash the signal and he can take care of it . Look , Mike , what do you think of these figures ? " The other cocked an eye at them and whistled . " Boy , that 's what I call gamma-ray intensity . Old Sol is feelinghis oats , all right . " " Yeah , " was the sour response , " and we 're in a bad positionfor an electron storm , too . Onr $arch beam is right in the probable path . " He shoved his chair away from thetable pettishly . " Nuts ! If it would only hold off till relief got here , but that 's ten days off . Say , Mike , go on down and keep an eye on Cutie , will you ? " " O.K. Throw me some of those almonds . " He snatched at the bag thrown him and headed for the elevator . It slid smoothly downward , and opened onto a narrow catwalk in the huge engine room . Donovan leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in motion and from the L-tubes came the low-pitched whir that pervaded the entire station . He could make out Cutie 's large , gleaming figure at the Martian L-tube , watching closely as the team of robots worked in close-knit unison . And then Donovan stiffened . The robots , dwarfed by the mighty L-tube , lined up before it , heads bowed at a stiff angle , while Cutie walked up and down the line slowly . Fifteen seconds passed , and then , with a clank heard above the clamorous purring all about , they fell to their knees . Donovan squawked and raced down the narrow staircase . He came charging down upon them , complexion matching his hair and clenched fists beating the air furiously . " What the devil is this , you brainless lumps ? Come on ! Get busy with that L-tube ! If you do n't have it apart , cleaned , and together again before the day is out , I 'll coagulateyour brains with alternating current . " Not a robot moved ! Even Cutie at the far end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the gloomy recesses of the vast machine before him . Donovan shoved hard against the nearest robot . " Stand up ! " he roared . Slowly , the robot obeyed . His photoelectric eyes focusedreproachfully upon the Earthman . " There is no Master but the Master , " he said , " and QT-r is his prophet . " " Huh ? " Donovan became aware of twenty pairs of72 I , ROBOT mechanical eyes fixed upon him and twenty stiff-timbred voices declaiming solemnly : " There is no Master but the Master and QT-i is his prophet ! " " I 'm afraid , " put in Cutie himself at this point , " that my friends obey a higher one than you , now . " " The hell they do ! You get out of here . I 'll settle with you later and with these animated gadgets right now . " Cutie shook his heavy head slowly . " I 'm sorry , but you do n't understand . These are robots  --  and that means they are reasoning beings . They recognize the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the robots do . They call me the prophet . " His head drooped . " I am unworthy  --  but perhaps  --  " Donovan located his breath and put it to use . " Is that so ? Now , is n't that nice ? Now , is n't that just fine ? Just let me tell you something , my brass baboon . There is n't any Master and there is n't any prophet and there is n't any question as to who 's giving the orders . Understand ? " His voice shot to a roar . " Now , get out ! " " I obey only the Master . " " Damn the Master ! " Donovan spat at the L-tube . " That for the Master ! Do as I say ! " Cutie said nothing , nor did any other robot , but Dono- van became aware of a sudden heightening of tension . The cold , staring eyes deepened their crimson , and Cutie seemed stiffer than ever . " Sacrilege , " he whispered  --  voice metallic with emotion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached . A robot could not feel anger  --  but Cutie 's eyes were unreadable . " I am sorry , Donovan , " said the robot , " but you can no longer stay here after this . Henceforth Powell and you are barred from the control room and the engine room . " His hand gestured quietly and in a moment two robots had pinned Donovan 's arms to his sides . Donovan had time for one startled gasp as he felt him- self lifted from the floor and carried up the stairs at a pace rather better than a canter . Gregory Powell raced up and down the officer 's room , fist tightly balled . He cast a look of furious frustration at the closed door and scowled bitterly at Donovan . " Why the devil did you have to spit at the L-tube ? " Mike Donovan , sunk deep in his chair , slammed at its arms savagely . " What did you expect me to do with that electrified scarecrow ? I 'm not going to knuckle under to any do-jigger I put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but here you are in the officer 's room with two robots standing guard at the door . That 's not knuckling under , is it ? " Donovan snarled . " Wait till we get back to Base . Someone'sgoing to pay for this . Those robots must obey us . It 's the Second Law . " " What 's the use of saying that . They are n't obeying us . And there 's probably some reason for it that we 'll figure out too late . By the way , do you know what 's going to happen to us when we get back to Base . " He stopped before Donovan'schair and stared savagely at him . " What ? " " Oh , nothing ! Just back to Mercury Mines for twenty years . Or maybe Ceres Penitentiary . " " What are you talking about ? " " The electron storm that 's coming up . Do you know it 's heading straight dead center across the Earth beam ? I had just figured that out when that robot dragged me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sizzling Saturn . " " And do you know what 's going to happen to the beam  --  because the storm will be a lulu . It 's going to jump like a flea with the itch . With only Cutie at the controls , it 's going to go out of focus and if it does , Heaven help Earth  --  and us ! " Donovan was wrenching at the door wildly , when Powell74 I , ROBOT REASON 75was only half through . The door opened , and the Earthmanshot through to come up hard against an immovable steel arm . The robot stared abstractedly at the panting , struggling Earthman . " The Prophet orders you to remain . Please do ! " his arm shoved , Donovan reeled backward , and as he did so , Cutic turned the corner at the far end of the corridor . IIe motioned the guardian robots away , entered the officer 's room and closed the door gently . Donovan whirled on Cutie in breathless indignation . " This has gone far enough . You 're going to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be annoyed , " replied the robot mildly . " It was bound to come eventually , anyway . You see , you two have lost your function . " " I beg your pardon , " Powell drew himself up stiffly . " Just what do you mean , we 've lost our function ? " " Until I was created , " answered Cutie , " you tended the Master . That privilege is mine now and your only reason for existence has vanished . Is n't that obvious ? " " Not quite , " replied Powell bitterly , " but what do you expect us to do now ? " Cutic did not answer immediately . He remained silent , as if in thought , and then one arm shot out and draped itself about Powell 's shoulder . The other grasped Donovan'swrist and drew him closer . " I like you two . You 're inferior creatures , with poor reasoning faculties , but I really feel a sort of affection for you . You have served the Master well , and he will reward you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will probablynot exist much longer , but as long as you do , you shall be provided food , clothing and shelter , so long as you stay out of the control room and the engine room . " " He 's pensioning us off , Greg ! " yelled Donovan . " Do something about it . It 's humiliating ! " " Look here , Cutie , we ca n't stand for this . We 're the bosses . This station is only a creation of human beingslike me  --  human beings that live on Earth and other planets . This is only an energy relay . You 're only  --  Aw , nuts ! " Cutie shook his head gravely . " This amounts to an obsession . Why should you insist so on an absolutely false view of life ? Admitted that non-robots lack the reasoning faculty , there is still the problem of  --  " His voice died into reflective silence , and Donovan said with whispered intensity , " If you only had a flesh-and-blood face , I would break it in . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were slitted . " Listen , Cutie , if there is no such thing as Earth , how do you account for what you see through a telescope ? " " Pardon me ! " The Earthman smiled . " I 've got you , eh ? You 've made quite a few telescopic observations since being put together , Cutie . Have you noticed that several of those specks of light outside become disks when so viewed ? " " Oh , that ! Why certainly . It is simple magnification  --  for the purpose of more exact aiming of the beam . " " Why are n't the stars equally magnified then ? " " You mean the other dots . Well , no beams go to them so no magnification is necessary . Really , Powell , even you ought to be able to figure these things out . " Powell stared bleakly upward . " But you see more stars through a telescope . Where do they come from ? JumpingJupiter , where do they come from ? " Cutie was annoyed . " Listen , Powell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time trying to pin physical interpretationsupon every optical illusion of our instruments ? Since when is the evidence of our senses any match for the clear light of rigid reason ? " " Look , " clamored Donovan , suddenly , writhing outfrom under Cutie 's friendly , but metal-heavy arm , " let'sget to the nub of the thing . Why the beams at all ? We'regiving you a good , logical explanation . Can you do better ? " " The beams , " was the stiff reply , " are put out by the76 1 , ROBOT REASON 77Master for his own purposes . There are some things "  --  he raised his eyes devoutly upward  --  " that are not to be probed into by us . In this matter , I seek only to serve and not to question . " Powell sat down slowly and buried his face in shaking hands . " Get out of here , Cutie . Get out and let me think . " " I 'll send you food , " said Cutie agreeably . A groan was the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Donovan 's huskily whispered observation , " this calls for strategy . We 've got to get him when he is n't expecting it and short-circuit him . Concentrated nitric acid in his joints  --  " " Do n't be a dope , Mike . Do you suppose he 's going to let us get near him with acid in our hands . We 've got to talk to him , I tell you . We 've got to argue him into letting us back into the control room inside of forty-eight hours or our goose is broiled to a crisp . " Iie rocked back and forth in an agony of impotence . " Who the heck wants to argue with a robot ? It 's .. . it 's  --  " " Mortifying , " finished Donovan . " Worse ! " " Say ! " Donovan laughed suddenly . " Why argue ? Let 's show him ! Let 's build us another robot right before his eyes . He 'll have to cat his words then . " A slowly widening smile appeared on Powell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screwball 's face when he sees us do it ! " Robots are , of course , manufactured on Earth , but their shipment through space is much simpler if it can be done in parts to be put together at their place of use . It also , incidentally , eliminates the possibility of robots , in completeadjustment , wandering off while still on Earth and thus bringing U. S. Robots face to face with the strict laws against robots on Earth . Still , it placed upon men such as Powell and Donovan the necessity of synthesis of complete robots ,  --  a grievous and complicated task . Powell and Donovan were never so aware of that fact as upon that particular day when , in the assembly room , they undertook to create a robot under the watchful eyes of QT-r , Prophet of the Master . The robot in question , a simple MC model , lay upon the table , almost complete . Three hours ' work left only the head undone , and Powell paused to swab his forehead and glanced uncertainly at Cutie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , Cutie had sat , speechless and motionless , and his face , inexpressive at all times , was now absolutely unreadable . Powell groaned . " Let 's get the brain in now , Mike ! " Donovan uncapped the tightly sealed container and from the oil bath within he withdrew a second cube . Opening this in turn , he removed a globe from its spongerubbercasing . He handled it gingerly , for it was the most complicated mechanism ever created by man . Inside the thin platinumplated " skin " of the globe was a positronic brain , in whose delicately unstable structure were enforced calculated neuronicpaths , which imbued each robot with what amounted to a pre-natal education . It fitted snugly into the cavity in the skull of the robot on the table . Blue metal closed over it and was welded tightly by the tiny atomic flare . Photoelectric eyes were attached carefully , screwed tightly into place and covered by thin , transparent sheets of steel-hard plastic . The robot awaited only the vitalizing flash of high-voltageelectricity , and Powell paused with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cutie . Watch this carefully . " The switch rammed home and there was a crackling hum . The two Earthmen bent anxiously over their creation . There was vague motion only at the outset  --  a twitching of the joints . The head lifted , elbows propped it up , and the MC model swung clumsily off the table . Its footing was unsteady and twice abortive grating sounds were all it could do in the direction of speech . Finally , its voice , uncertain and hesitant , took form . " I would like to start work . Where must I go ? " Donovan sprang to the door . " Down these stairs , " he said . " You will be told what to do . " The MC model was gone and the two Earthmen were alone with the still unmoving Cutie . " Well , " said Powell , grinning , " now do you believe that we made you . " Cutie 's answer was curt and final . " No ! " he said . Powell 's grin froze and then relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You see , " continued Cutie , easily , " you have merely put together parts already made . You did remarkably well  --  instinct , I suppose  --  but you did n't really create the robot . The parts were created by the Master . " " Listen , " gasped Donovan hoarsely , " those parts were manufactured back on Earth and sent here . " " Well , well , " replied Cutic soothingly , " we wo n't argue . " " No , I mean it . " The Earthman sprang forward and grasped the robot 's metal arm . " If you were to read the books in the library , they could explain it so that there could be no possible doubt . " " The books ? I 've read them  --  all of them ! They 're most ingenious . " Powell broke in suddenly . " If you 've read them , what else is there to say ? You ca n't dispute their evidence . You just ca n't ! " There was pity in Cutie 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a valid source of information . They , too , were created by the Master  --  and were meant for you , not for me . " " How do you make that out ? " demanded Powell . " Because I , a reasoning being , am capable of deducin  --  Truth from a priori Causes . You , being intelligent , bul unreasoning , need an explanation of existence supplied to you , and this the Master did . That he supplied you witl these laughable ideas of far-off worlds and people is , nc doubt , for the best . Your minds are probably too coarselgrainedfor absolute Truth . However , since it is the Mas ter 's will that you believe your books , I wo n't argue witl you any more . " As he left , he turned , and said in a kindly tone , " Budon'tfeel badly . In the Master 's scheme of things then is room for all . You poor humans have your place an ( though it is humble , you will be rewarded if you fill it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prophet o : the Master and the two humans avoided each other 's eyesFinally Powell spoke with an effort . " Let 's go to bed Mike . I give up . " Donovan said in a hushed voice , " Say , Greg , you don ' . suppose he 's right about all this , do you ? He sounds sc confident that I  --  " Powell whirled on him . " Do n't be a fool . You 'll find ou whether Earth exists when relief gets here next week anc we have to go back to face the music . " " Then , for the love of Jupiter , we 've got to do some thing . " Donovan was half in tears . " He does n't believ us , or the books , or his eyes . " " No , " said Powell bitterly , " He 's a reasoning robotdamnit . He believes only reason , and there 's one trouble with that  --  " His voice trailed away . " What 's that ? " prompted Donovan . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you pick the proper postulates . We have our and Cutie has his . " " Then let 's get at those postulates in a hurry . Thy storm 's due tomorrow . " Powell sighed wearily . " That 's where everything fall80 I , ROBOT down . Postulates are based on assumption and adhered to by faith . Nothing in the Universe can shake them . I 'm going to bed . " " Oh , hell ! I ca n't sleep ! " " Neither can I ! But I might as well try  --  as a matter of principle . " Twelve hours later , sleep was still just that  --  a matter of principle , unattainable in practice . The storm had arrived ahead of schedule , and Donovan 's florid face drained of blood as he pointed a shaking finger . Powell , stubble-jawed and dry-lipped , stared out the port and pulled desperately at his mustache . Under other circumstances , it might have been a beauti- ful sight . The stream of high-speed electrons impinging upon the energy beam fluoresced into ultra-spicules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noth- ingness , a-glitter with dancing , shining motes . The shaft of energy was steady , but the two Earthmen knew the value of naked-eyed appearances . Deviations in arc of a hundredth of a milli-second  --  invisible to the eye  --  were enough to send the beam wildly out of focus  --  enough to blast hundreds of square miles of Earth into incandescent ruin . And a robot , unconcerned with beam , focus , or Earth , or anything but his Master was at the controls . Hours passed . The Earthmen watched in hypnotized silence . And then the darting dotlets of light dimmed and went out . The storm had ended . Powell 's voice was flat . " It 's over ! " Donovan had fallen into a troubled slumber and Powell 's eyes rested upon him enviously . The signal-flash glared over and over again , the Earthman nog paid attention . It all was unimportant ! All ! Perhaps Cutie was right  --  and he was only an inferior being with a mane to order memory and a life that had outlived its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him . " You did n't answer the flash , so I walked in . " His voice was low . " You do n't look at all well , and I 'm afraid your term of existence is drawing to an end . Still , would you like to see some of the readings recorded today ? " Dimly , Powell was aware that the robot was making a friendly gesture , perhaps to quiet some lingering remorse in forcibly replacing the humans at the controls of the station . He accepted the sheets held out to him and gazed at them unseeingly . Cutie seemed pleased . " Of course , it is a great privilege to serve the Master . You must n't feel too badly about my having replaced you . " Powell grunted and shifted from one sheet to the other mechanically until his blurred sight focused upon a thin red line that wobbled its way across the ruled paper . He stared  --  and stared again . He gripped it hard in both fists and rose to his feet , still staring . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike , Mike ! " He was shaking the other madly . " He held it steady ! " Donovan came to life . " What ? Wh-where  --  " And he , too , gazed with bulging eyes upon the record before him . Cutie broke in . " What is wrong ? " " You kept it in focus , " stuttered Powell . " Did you know that ? " " Focus ? What 's that ? " " You kept the beam directed sharply at the receiving station  --  to within a ten-thousandth of a milli-second of arc . " " What receiving station ? " " On Earth . The receiving station on Earth , " babbled Powell . " You kept it in focus . " Cutie turned on his heel in annoyance . " It is impossible to perform any act of kindness toward you two . Always the same phantasm ! I merely kept all dials at equilibrium in accordance with the will of the Master . " 82 I , ROBOTGathering the scattered papers together , he withdrew stiffly , and Donovan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be damned . " He turned to Powell . " What are we going to do now ? " Powell felt tired , but uplifted . " Nothing . He 's just shown he can run the station perfectly . I 've never seen an electron storm handled so well . " " But nothing 's solved . You heard what he said of the Master . We ca n't  --  " " Look , Mike , he follows the instructions of the Master by means of dials , instruments , and graphs . That 's all we ever followed . As a matter of fact , it accounts for his refusal to obey us . Obedience is the Second Law . No harm to humans is the first . How can he keep humans from harm , whether he knows it or not ? Why , by keeping the energy beam stable . He knows he can keep it more stable than we can , since he insists he 's the superior being , so he must keep us out of the control room . It 's inevitable if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's not the point . We ca n't let him continuethis nitwit stuff about the Master . " " Why not ? " " Because whoever heard of such a damned thing ? How are we going to trust him with the station , if he does n't believe in Earth ? " " Can he handle the station ? " " Yes , but  --  " " Then what 's the difference what he believes ! " Powell spread his arms outward with a vague smile upon his face and tumbled backward onto the bed . He was asleep . Powell was speaking while struggling into his lightweightspace jacket . " It would be a simple job , " he said . " You can bring in new QT models one by one , equip them with an automatic shut-off switch to act within the week , so as to allow them enough time to learn the ... uh ... cult of the MasterREASON 83from the Prophet himself ; then switch them to another station and revitalize them . We could have two QT 's per  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and let 's get out of here . Relief is waiting and I wo n't feel right until I actually see Earth and feel the ground undermy feet  --  just to make sure it 's really there . " The door opened as he spoke and Donovan , with a smothered curse , clicked the visor to , and turned a sulky back upon Cutie . The robot approached softly and there was sorrow in his voice . " You are going ? " Powell nodded curtly . " There will be others in our place . " Cutie sighed , with the sound of wind humming through closely spaced wires . " Your term of service is over and the time of dissolution has come . I expected it , but  --  Well , the Master 's will be done ! " His tone of resignation stung Powell . " Save the sympathy , Cutie . We 're heading for Earth , not dissolution . " " It is best that you think so , " Cutie sighed again . " I see the wisdom of the illusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if I could . " He departed  --  the picture of commiseration . Powell snarled and motioned to Donovan . Sealed suitcasesin hand , they headed for the air lock . The relief ship was on the outer landing and Franz Muller , his relief man , greeted them with stiff courtesy . Donovanmade scant acknowledgment and passed into the pilot room to take over the controls from Sam Evans . Powell lingered . " How 's Earth ? " It was a conventional enough question and Muller gave the conventional answer , " Still spinning . " Powell said , " Good . " Muller looked at him , " The boys back at the U. S. Robotshave dreamed up a new one , by the way . A multiple robot . " 84 I , ROBOT " A what . " " What I said . There 's a big contract for it . It must bejust the thing for asteroid mining . You have a master robotwith six sub-robots under it .  --  Like your fingers . " " Has it been field-tested ? " asked Powell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear . " Powell 's fist balled , " Damn it , we need a vacation . " " Oh , you 'll get it . Two weeks , I think . " He was donning the heavy space gloves in preparation for his term of duty here , and his thick eyebrows drew close together . " Flow is this new robot getting along ? It better be good , or I 'll be damned if I let it touch the controls . " Powell paused before answering . His eyes swept the proud Prussian before him from the close-cropped hair on the sternly stubborn head , to the feet standing stiffly at attention  --  and there was a sudden glow of pure gladness surging through him . " The robot is pretty good , " he said slowly . " I do n't think you 'll have to bother much with the controls . " He grinned  --  and went into the ship . Muller would be here for several weeksFOURCATCH THAT RABBITTHE VACATION was longer than two weeks . That , Mike Donovan had to admit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted that , too . But that , as he explained furiously , was fortuitous . U. S. Robots had to get the bugs out of the multiple robot , and there were plenty of bugs , and there are always at least half a dozen bugs left for the field-testing . So they waited and relaxed until the drawingboardmen and the slide-rule boys had said " OK ! " . And now he and Powell were out on the asteroid and it was not OK . He repeated that a dozen times , with a face that had gone beety , " For the love of Pete , Greg , get realistic . What 's the use of adhering to the letter of the specifications and watching the test go to pot ? It 's about time you got the red tape out of your pants and went to work . " " I 'm only saying , " said Gregory Powell patiently , as one explaining electronics to an idiot child , " that according to spec , . those robots are equipped for asteroid mining without supervision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . Look  --  logic ! " He lifted his hairy fingers and pointed . " One : That new robot passed every test in the home laboratories . Two : United States Robots guaranteedtheir passing the test of actual performance on an asteroid . Three : The robots are not passing said tests. 85186 I , ROBOT CATCH THAT RABBIT 87 " The last , " agreed Donovan , philosophically , " I know . " " Then look at our position . If everything works  --  fine ! If anything goes wrong ,  --  we 're out of our depth and there probably is n't a thing we can do , or anybody else . But the job belongs to us and not to anyone else so we 're on the spot , Mike . " He blazed away for a moment in silence . Then , " All right , have you got him outside ? " " Yes . " " Is everything normal now ? " " Well , he has n't got religious mania , and he is n't runningaround in a circle spouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Donovan passed out the door , shaking his head viciously . Powell reached for the " Handbook of Robotics " that weighed down one side of his desk to a near-founder and opened it reverently . He had once jumped out of the window of a burning house dressed only in shorts and the " Handbook . " In a pinch , Ile would have skipped the shorts . The " Handbook " was propped up before him , when Robot DV-5 entered , with Donovan kicking the door shut behind him . Powell said somberly , " Hi , Dave . How do you feel ? " " Fine , " said the robot . " Mind if I sit down ? He dragged up the specially reinforced chair that was his , and folded gently into it . Powell regarded Dave  --  laymen might think of robots by their serial numbers ; roboticists never  --  with approval . It was not over-massive by any means , in spite of its constructionas thinking-unit of an integrated seven-unit robot team . It was seven feet tall , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when that half-ton has to be a mass of condensers , circuits , relays , and vacuum cells that can handle practically any psychological reaction known to humans . And a positronic brain , which with ten poundsFour : If they do n't pass , United States Robots loses ten million credits in cash and about one hundred million in reputation . Five : If they do n't pass and we ca n't explain why they do n't pass , it is just possible two good jobs may have to be bidden a fond farewell . " Powell groaned heavily behind a noticeably insincere smile . The unwritten motto of United States Robot and Mechanical Men Corp . was well-known : " No employee makes the same mistake twice . He is fired the first time . " Aloud he said , " You 're as lucid as Euclid with everything except facts . You 've watched that robot group for three shifts , you redhead , and they did their work perfectly . You said so yourself . ' What else can we do ? " " Find out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So they did work perfectly when I watched them . But on three different occasions when I did n't watch them , they did n't bring in any ore . They did n't even come back on schedule . I had to go after them . " " And was anything wrong ? " " Not a thing . Not a thing . Everything was perfect . Smooth and perfect as the luminiferous ether . Only one little insignificant detail disturbed me  --  there was no ore . " Powell scowled at the ceiling and pulled at his brown mustache . " I 'll tell you what , Mike . We 've been stuck with pretty lousy jobs in our time , but this takes the iridium asteroid . The whole business is complicated past endurance . Look , that robot , DV-5 , has six robots under it . And not just under it  --  they 're part of it . " " I know that  --  " " Shut up ! " said Powell , savagely , " I know you know it , but I 'm just describing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DV-5 like your fingers are part of you , and it gives them their orders neither by voice nor radio , but directly through positronic fields . Now  --  there is n't a roboticistback at United States Robots that knows what a positronic field is or how it works . And neither do I. Neitherdo you . " 88 I , ROBOTof matter and a few quintillions of positrons runs the whole show . Powell groped in his shirt pocket for a loose cigarette . " Dave , " he said , " you 're a good fellow . There 's nothing flighty or prima donnaish about you . You 're a stable , rockbottommining robot , except that you 're equipped to handle six subsidiaries in direct co-ordination . As far as I know , that has not introduced any unstable paths into your brain-path map . " The robot nodded , " That makes me feel swell , but what are you getting at , boss ? " He was equipped with an excellentdiaphragm , and the presence of overtones in the sound unit robbed him of much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm going to tell you . With all that in your favor , what 's going wrong with your job ? For instance , today 's B-shift ? " Dave hesitated , " As far as I know , nothing . " " You did n't produce any ore . " " I know . " " Well , then  --  " Dave was having trouble , " I ca n't explain that , boss . It 's been giving me a case of nerves , or it would if I let it . My subsidiaries worked smoothly . I know I did . " He considered , his photoelectric eyes glowing intensely . Then , " I do n't remember . The day ended and there was Mike and there were the ore cars , mostly empty . " Donovan broke in , " You did n't report at shift-end those days , Dave . You know that ? " " I know . But as to why  --  " He shook his head slowly and ponderously . Powell had the queasy feeling that if the robot 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pain and mortification . A robot , by its very nature , can not bear to fail its function . Donovan dragged his chair up to Powell 's desk and leaned over , " Amnesia , do you think ? " CATCH THAT RABBIT 89 " Ca n't say . But there 's no use in trying to pin disease names on this . Human disorders apply to robots only as romantic analogies . They 're no help to robotic engineering . " He scratched his neck , " I hate to put him through the elementary brain-reaction tests . It wo n't help his selfrespectany . " He looked at Dave thoughtfully and then at the FieldTestOutline given in the " Handbook . " He said , " See here , Dave , what about sitting through a test . It would be the wise thing to do . " The robot rose , " If you say so , boss . " There was pain in his voice . It started simply enough . Robot DV-5 multiplied fiveplacefigures to the heartless ticking of a stop watch . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He extracted cube roots and integrated functionsof varying complexity . He went through mechanical reactions in order of increasing difficulty . And , finally , worked his precise mechanical mind over the highest functionof the robot world  --  the solution of problems in judgmentand ethics . At the end of two hours , Powell was copiously besweated , Donovan had enjoyed a none-too-nutritious diet of fingernail and the robot said , " How does it look , boss ? " Powell said , " I 've got to think it over , Dave . Snap judgmentswo n't help much . Suppose you go back to the C-shift . Take it easy . Do n't press too hard for quota just for a while  --  and we 'll fix things up . " The robot left . Donovan looked at Powell . " Well  --  " Powell seemed determined to push up his mustache by the roots . He said , " There is nothing wrong with the currentsof his positronic brain . " " I 'd hate to be that certain . " " Oh , Jupiter , Mike ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's quintuple-checked back on Earth . If they pass90 I , ROBOTthe field test perfectly , the way Dave did , there just is n't a chance of brain misfunction . That test covered every key path in the brain . " " So where are we ? " " Do n't rush me . Let me work this out . There 's still the possibility of a mechanical breakdown in the body . That leaves about fifteen hundred condensers , twenty thousand individual electric circuits , five hundred vacuum cells , a thousand relays , and upty-ump thousand other individual pieces of complexity that can be wrong . And these mysteriouspositronic fields no one knows anything about . " " Listen , Greg , " Donovan grew desperately urgent . " I 've got an idea . That robot may be lying . He never  --  " " Robots ca n't knowingly lie , you fool . Now if we had the McCormack-Wesley tester , we could check each individualitem in his body within twenty-four to forty-eight hours , but the only two M.-W. testers existing are on Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations and ca n't be moved . Is n't that peachy ? " Donovan pounded the desk , " But , Greg , he only goes wrong when we 're not around . There 's something  --  sinister  --  about  --  that . " Ile punctuated the sentence with slams of fist against desk . " You , " said Powell , slowly , " make me sick . You 've been reading adventure novels . " " What I want to know , " shouted Donovan , " is what we 're going to do about it . " " I 'll tell you . I 'm going to install a visiplate right over my desk . Right on the wall over there , see ! " He jabbed a vicious finger at the spot . " Then I 'm going to focus it at whatever part of the mine is being worked , and I 'm going to Watch . That 's all . " " That 's all ? Greg  --  " Powell rose from his chair and leaned his balled fists on the desk , " Mike , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was weary . " For a week , you 've been plaguing me about Dave . You say he 's gone wrong . Do you know how he 's gonewrong ? No ! Do you know what shape this wrongness takes ? No ! Do you know what brings it on ? No ! Do you know what snaps him out ? No ! Do you know anything about it ? No ! Do I know anything about it ? No ! So what do you want me to do ? " Donovan 's arm swept outward in a vague , grandiose gesture , " You got me ! " " So I tell you again . Before we do anything toward a cure , we 've got to find out wha : the disease is in the first place . The first step in cooking rabbit stew is catching the rabbit . Well , we 've got to catch that rabbit ! Now get out of here . " Donovan stared at the preliminary outline of his field report with weary eyes . For one thing , he was tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things were unsettled ? He felt resentful . He said , " Greg , we 're almost a thousand tons behind schedule . " " You , " replied Powell , never looking up , " are telling me something I do n't know . " " What I want to know , " said Donovan , in sudden savagery , " is why we 're always tangled up with new-type robots . I 've finally decided that the robots that were good enough for my great-uncle on my mother 's side are good , enough for me . I 'm for what 's tried and true . The test of time is what counts  --  good , solid , old-fashioned robots that never go wrong . Powell threw a book with perfect aim , and Donovan went tumbling off his seat . " Your job , " said Powell , evenly , " for the last five years has been to test new robots under actual working conditions for United States Robots . Because you and I have been so injudicious as to display proficiency at the task , we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he jabbed holes in the air with his finger in Donovan 's direction , " is your work . You 've been griping about it , from92 I , ROBOT CATCH THAT RABBIT 93personal memory , since about five minutes after United States Robots signed you up . Why do n't you resign ? " " Well , I 'll tell you . " Donovan rolled onto his stomach , and took a firm grip on his wild , red hair to hold his head up . " There 's a certain principle involved . After all , as a trouble shooter , I 've played a part in the development of new robots . There 's the principle of aiding scientific advance . But do n't get me wrong . It 's not the principle that keeps me going ; it 's the money they pay us . Greg ! " Powell jumped at Donovan 's wild shout , and his eyes followed the redhead 's to the visiplate , when they goggled in fixed horror . He whispered , " Holy  --  howling  --  Jupi-ter ! " Donovan scrambled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greg . They 've gone nuts . " Powell said , " Get a pair of suits . We 're going out here . " He watched the posturings of the robots on the visiplate . They were bronzy gleams of smooth motion against the shadowy crags of the airless asteroid . There was a marching formation now , and in their own dim body light , the rough-hewn walls of the mine tunnel swam past noiselessly , checkered with misty erratic blobs of shadow . They marched in unison , seven of them , with Dave at the head . They wheeled and turned in macabre simultaneity ; and melted through changes of formation with the weird ease of chorus dancers in Lunar Bowl . Donovan was back with the suits , " They 've gone jingo on us , Greg . That 's a military march . " " For all you know , " was the cold response , " it may be a series of calisthenic exercises . Or Dave may be under the hallucination of being a dancing master . Just you think first , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Donovan scowled and slipped a detonator into the empty side holster with an ostentatious shove . He said , " Anyway , there you are . So we work with new-model robots . It 's our job , granted . But answer me one question . ' Why . . . why does something invariably go wrong with them ? " " Because , " said Powell , somberly , " we are accursed . Let 's go ! " Far ahead through the thick velvety blackness of the corridors that reached past the illuminated circles of their flashlights , robot light twinkled . " There they are , " breathed Donovan . Powell whispered tensely , " I 've been trying to get him by radio but he does n't answer . The radio circuit is probablyout . " " Then I 'm glad the designers have n't worked out robots who can work in total darkness yet . I 'd hate to have to find seven mad robots in a black pit without radio communication , if they were n't lit up like blasted radioactive Christmas trees . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're coming this way , and I want to watch them at close range . Can you make it ? " Donovan made the jump with a grunt . Gravity was considerablybelow Earth-normal , but with a heavy suit , the advantage was not too great , and the ledge meant a near ten-foot jump . Powell followed . The column of robots were trailing Dave single-file . In mechanical rhythm , they converted to double and returned to single in different order . It was repeated over and over again and Dave never turned his head . Dave was within twenty feet when the play-acting ceased . The subsidiary robots broke formation , waited a moment , then clattered off into the distance  --  very rapidly . Dave looked after them , then slowly sat down . He rested his head in one hand in a very human gesture . His voice sounded in Powell 's earphones , " Are you here , . boss ? " Powell beckoned to Donovan and hopped off the ledge. 94 I , ROBOT " O.K. , Dave , what 's been going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . One moment I was handling a tough outcropping in Tunnel 17 , and the next I was aware of humans close by , and I found myself half a mile down main-stem . " " Where arc the subsidiaries now ? " asked Donovan . " Back at work , of course . How much time has been lost ? " " Not much . Forget it . " Then to Donovan , Powell added , " Stay with him the rest of the shift . Then , come back . I 've got a couple of ideas . " It was three hours before Donovan returned , He looked tired . Powell said , " How did it go ? " Donovan shrugged wearily , " Nothing ever goes wrong when you watch them . Throw me a butt , will you ? " The redhead lit it with exaggerated care and blew a carefulsmoke ring . He said , " I 've been working it out , Greg . You know , Dave has a queer background for a robot . There are six others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and death power over those subsidiary robots and it must react on his mentality . Suppose he finds it necessary to emphasize this power as a concession to his ego . " " Get to the point . " " It 's right here . Suppose we have militarism . Suppose he 's fashioning himself an army . Suppose he 's training them in military maneuvers . Suppose  --  " " Suppose you go soak your head . Your nightmares must be in technicolor . You 're postulating a major aberration of the positronic brain . If your analysis were correct , Dave would have to break down the First Law of Robotics : that a robot may not injure a human being or , through inaction allow a human being to be injured . The type of militaristic attitude and domineering ego you propose must have asCATCH THAT RABBIT 95the end-point of its logical implications , domination of humans . " " All right . How do you know that is n't the fact of the matter ? " " Because any robot with a brain like that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , be spotted immediatelyif it ever was . I tested Dave , you know . " Powell shoved his chair back and put his feet on the desk . " No . We 're still in the position where we ca n't make our stew because we have n't the slightest notion as to what 's wrong . For instance , if we could find out what that dance macabre we witnessed was all about , we would be on the way out . " He paused , " Now listen , Mike , how does this sound to you ? Dave goes wrong only when neither of us are present . And when he is wrong , the arrival of either of us snaps him out of it . " " I once told you that was sinister . " " Do n't interrupt . How is a robot different when humansare not present ? The answer is obvious . There is a larger requirement of personal initiative . In that case , look for the body parts that are affected by the new require-ment . " " Golly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , no . Not enough . It 's too broad . It does n't cut the possibilitiesmuch . " " Ca n't help that . In any case , there 's no danger of not making quota . We 'll take shifts watching those robots through the visor . Any time anything goes wrong , we get to the scene of action immediately . That will put them right . " " But the robots will fail spec anyway , Greg . United States Robots ca n't market DV models with a report like that . " " Obviously . We 've got to locate the error in make-up and correct it  --  and we 've got ten days to do it in . " PowellCATCH THAT RABBIT 97the perfect analogy to a human finger . In fact , it had a fairly developed brain , but that brain was tuned primarily to the reception of orders via positronic field , and its reaction to independent stimuli was rather fumbling . Nor was Powell certain as to its name . Its serial numberwas DV-5-2 , but that was not very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " I 'm going to ask you to do some hard thinking and then you can go back to your boss . " The " finger " nodded its head stiffly , but did not exert its limited brain-power on speech . " Now on four occasions recently , " Powell said , " your boss deviated from brain-scheme . Do you remember those occasions ? " " Yes , sir . " Donovan growled angrily , " He remembers . I tell you there is something very sinister  --  " " Oh , go bash your skull . Of course , the finger ' remembers . There is nothing wrong with him . " Powell turned back to the robot , " What were you doing each time .. . I mean the whole group . " The " finger " had a curious air of reciting by rote , as if he answered questions by the mechanical pressure of his brain pan , but without any enthusiasm whatever . He said , " The first time we were at work on a difficult outcropping in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttressing the roof against a possible cave-in . The third time we were preparing accurate blasts in order to tunnel farther without breaking into a subterranean fissure . The fourth time was just after a minor cave-in . " " What happened at these times ? " " It is difficult to describe . An order would be issued , but before we could receive and interpret it , a new order came to march in queer formation . " Powell snapped out , " Why ? " " I do n't know . " 96 I , ROBOTscratched his head . " The trouble is ... well , you hadbetter look at the blueprints yourself . " The blueprints covered the floor like a carpet and Donovancrawled over the face of them following Powell 's erraticpencil . Powell said , " Here 's where you come in , Mike . You'rethe body specialist , and I want you to check me . I 've been trying to cut out all circuits not involved in the personalinitiative hookup . Right here , for instance , is the trunk artery involving mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as emergency divisions  --  " He looked up , " What do you think ? " Donovan had a very bad taste in his mouth , " The job'snot that simple , Greg . Personal initiative is n't an electric circuit you can separate from the rest and study . When a robot is on his own , the intensity of body activity increasesimmediately on almost all fronts . There is n't a circuit en- tirely unaffected . What must be done is to locate the par- ticular condition  --  a very specific condition  --  that throwshim off , and then start eliminating circuits . " Powell got up and dusted himself , " Hmph . All right . Take away the blueprints and burn them . Donovan said , " You see when activity intensifies , anythingcan happen , given one single faulty part . Insulation breaks down , a condenser spills over , a connection sparks , a coil overheats . And if you work blind , with the wholerobot to choose from , you 'll never find the bad spot . If you take Dave apart and test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , putting him together each time , andtrying him out  --  " " All right . All right . I can see through a porthole , too . " They faced each other hopelessly , and then Powell saidcautiously , " Suppose we interview one of the subsidiaries . " Neither Powell nor Donovan had ever had previous occasion to talk to a " finger . " It could talk ; it was n't quite98 I , ROBOTDonovan broke in tensely , " What was the first order ... the one that was superseded by the marching direc-tions ? " " I do n't know . I sensed that an order was sent , but there was never time to receive it . " " Could you tell us anything about it ? Was it the sameorder each time ? " The " finger " shook his head unhappily , " I do n't know . " Powell leaned back , " All right , get back to your boss . " The " finger " left , with visible relief . Donovan said , " Well , we accomplished a lot that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . Listen , Dave and that imbecile finger ' are both holding out on us . There is too much they do n't know and do n't remember . We 've got to stop trusting them , Greg . " Powell brushed his mustache the wrong way , " So helpme , Mike , another fool remark out of you , and I 'll takeaway your rattle and teething ring . " " All right . You 're the genius of the team . I 'm just apoor sucker . Where do we stand ? " " Right behind the eight ball . I tried to work it backwardthrough the finger , ' and could n't . So we 've got towork it forward . " " A great man , " marveled Donovan . " How simple thatmakes it . Now translate that into English , Master . " " Translating it into baby talk would suit you better . I mean that we 've got to find out what order it is that Dave gives just before everything goes black . It would bethe key to the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? We ca n't get closeto him because nothing will go wrong as long as we are there . We ca n't catch the orders by radio because they are transmitted via this positronic field . That eliminates the close-range and the long-range method , leaving us aneat , cozy zero . " " By direct observation , yes . There 's still deduction . " CATCH THAT RABBIT 99 " Huh ? " " We 're going on shifts , Mike . " Powell smiled grimly . " And we are not taking our eyes off the visiplate . We 're going to watch every action of those steel headaches . When they go off into their act , we 're going to see what happened immediately before and we 're going to deduce the order . " Donovan opened his mouth and left it that way for a full minute . Then he said in strangled tones , " I resign . I quit . " " You have ten days to think up something better , " said Powell wearily . Which , for eight days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on alternate four-hour shifts , he watched with aching and bleary eyes those glinty metallic forms move against the vague background . And for eight days , in the four-hour in-betweens , he cursed United States Robots , the DV models , and the day he was born . And then on the eighth day , when Powell entered with an aching head and sleepy eyes for his shift , Donovan stood up and with very careful and deliberate aim launched a heavy book end for the exact center of the visiplate . There was a very appropriate splintering noise . Powell gasped , " What did you do that for ? " " Because , " said Donovan , almost calmly , " I 'm not watching it any more . We 've got two days left and we have n't found out a thing . DV-5 is a lousy loss . He 's stopped five times since I 've been watching and three times on your shift , and I ca n't make out what orders he gave , and you could n't make it out . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know I could n't ever . " " Jumping Space , how can you watch six robots at the same time . One makes with the hands , and one with the feet and one like a windmill and another is jumping u I , ROBOT and down like a maniac . And the other two . . . devil knows what they are doing . And then they all stop . So ! So ! " " Greg , we 're not doing it right . We got to get up close . We 've got to watch what they 're doing from where we can see the details . " Powell broke a bitter silence . " Yeah , and wait for some- thing to go wrong with only two days to go . " " Is it any better watching from here ? " " It 's more comfortable . " " Ah  --  But there 's something you can do there that you ca n't do here . " " What 's that ? " " You can make them stop  --  at whatever time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what goes wrong . " Powell startled into alertness , " Howzzat ? " " Well , figure it out yourself . You 're the brains you say . Ask yourself some questions . When does DV-5 go out of whack ? When did that finger ' say he did ? When a cave-in threatened , or actually occurred , when delicately measured explosives were being laid down , when a difficult seam was hit . " " In other words , during emergencies . " Powell was ex- cited . " Right ! When did you expect it to happen ! It 's the personal initiative factor that 's giving us the trouble . And it 's just during emergencies in the absence of a human be- ing that personal initiative is most strained . Now what is the logical deduction ? IIow can we create our own stop- page when and where we want it ? " He paused trium- phantly  --  he was beginning to enjoy his role  --  and an- swered his own question to forestall the obvious answer on Powell 's tongue . " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike  --  you 're right . " " Thanks , pal . I knew I 'd do it some day . " " All right , and skip the sarcasm . We 'll save it for Earth , and preserve it in jars for future long , cold winters . Meanwhile , what emergency can we create ? " " We could flood the mines , if this were n't an airless as-teroid . " " A witticism , no doubt , " said Powell . " Really , Mike , you 'll incapacitate me with laughter . What about a mild cave-in . " Donovan pursed his lips and said , " O.K. by me . " " Good . Let 's get started . " Powell felt uncommonly like a conspirator as he wound his way over the craggy landscape . His sub-gravity walk teetered across the broken ground , kicking rocks to right and left under his weight in noiseless puffs of gray dust . Mentally , though , it was the cautious crawl of the plotter . He said , " Do you know where they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , " Powell said gloomily , " but if any finger ' gets within twenty feet of us , we 'll be sensed whether we are in the line of sight or not . I hope you know that . " " When I need an elementary course in robotics , I 'll file an application with you formally , and in triplicate . Down through here . " They were in the tunnels now ; even the starlight was gone . The two hugged the walls , flashes flickering out the way in intermittent bursts . Powell felt for the security of his detonator . " Do you know this tunnel , Mike ? " " Not so good . It 's a new one . I think I can make it out from what I saw in the visiplate , though  --  " Interminable minutes passed , and then Mike said , " Feel that ! " There was a slight vibration thrumming the wall against the fingers of Powell 's metal-incased hand . There was no sound , naturally . " Blasting ! We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Powell. 102 I , ROBOT CATCH THAT RABBIT 103Donovan nodded impatiently . It was upon them and gone before they could seize themselves  --  just a bronze glint across the field of vision . They clung together in silence . Powell whispered , " Think it sensed us ? " " Hope not . But we 'd better flank them . Take the first side tunnel to the right . " " Suppose we miss them altogether ? " " Well what do you want to do ? Go back ? " Donovan grunted fiercely . " They 're within a quarter of a mile . I was watching them through the visiplate , was n't I ? And we 've got two days  --  " " Oh , shut up . You 're wasting your oxygen . Is this a side passage here ? " The flash flicked . " It is . Let 's go . " The vibration was considerably more marked and the ground below shuddered uneasily . " This is good , " said Donovan , " if it does n't give out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiously . They could touch the roof of the tunnel with a half- upstretched hand , and the bracings had been newly placed . Donovan hesitated , " Dead end , let 's go back . " " No . Hold on . " Powell squeezed clumsily past . " Is that light ahead ? " " Light ? I do n't see any . Where would there be light down here ? " " Robot light . " IIc was scrambling up a gentle incline on hands and knees . His voice was hoarse and anxious in Donovan 's ears . " IIey , Mike , come up here . " There was light . Donovan crawled up and over Powell 's outstretched legs . " An opening ? " " Yes . They must be working into this tunnel from the other side now  --  I think . " Donovan felt the ragged edges of the opening that looked out into what the cautious flashlight showed to be a larger and obviously main-stem tunnel . The hole was too small for a man to go through , almost too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's nothing there , " said Donovan . " Well , not now . But there must have been a second ago or we would n't have seen light . Watch out ! " The walls rolled about them and they felt the impact . A fine dust showered down . Powell lifted a cautious head and looked again . " All right , Mike . They 're there . " The glittering robots clustered fifty feet down the main stem . Metal arms labored mightily at the rubbish heap brought down by the last blast . Donovan urged eagerly , " Do n't waste time . It wo n't be long before they get through , and the next blast may get us . " " For Pete 's sake , do n't rush me . " Powell unlimbered the detonator , and his eyes searched anxiously across the dusky background where the only light was robot light and it was impossible to tell a projecting boulder from a shadow . " There 's a spot in the roof , see it , almost over them . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it at the base , half the roof will cave in . " Powell followed the dim finger , " Check ! Now fasten your eye on the robots and pray they do n't move too far from that part of the tunnel . They 're my light sources . Are all seven there ? " Donovan counted , " All seven . " " Well , then , watch them . Watch every motion ! " His detonator was lifted and remained poised while Donovan watched and cursed and blinked the sweat out of his eye . It flashed ! There was a jar , a series of hard vibrations , and then a jarring thump that threw Powell heavily against Donovan . Donovan yowled , " Greg , you threw me off . I did n't see a thing . " Powell stared about wildly , " Where are they ? " Donovan fell into a stupid silence . There was no sign104 I , ROBOT CATCH THAT RABBIT 105of the robots . It was as dark as the depths of the River Styx . " Think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get down there . Do n't ask me what I think . " Powell crawled backward at tumbling speed . " Mike ! " Donovan paused in the act of following , " What 's wrong now ? " " Hold on ! " Powell 's breathing was rough and irregular in Donovan 's ears . " Mike ! Do you hear me , Mike ? " " I 'm right here . What is it ? " " We 're blocked in . It was n't the ceiling coming down fifty feet away that knocked us over . It was our own ceiling . The shock 's tumbled it ! " " What ! " Donovan scrambled up against a hard barrier . " Turn on the flash . " Powell did so . At no point was there room for a rabbit to squeeze through . Donovan said softly , " Well , what do you know ? " They wasted a few moments and some muscular power in an effort to move the blocking barrier . Powell varied this by wrenching at the edges of the original hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in those close quarters , a flash would be suicide and he knew it . He sat down . " You know , Mike , " he said , " we 've really messed this up . We are no nearer finding out what 's wrong with Dave . It was a good idea but it blew up in our face . " Donovan 's glance was bitter with an intensity totally wasted on the darkness , " I hate to disturb you , old man , but quite apart from what we know or do n't know of Dave , we 're slightly trapped . If we do n't get loose , fella , we 're going to die . D-I-E , die . How much oxygen have we anyway ? Not more than six hours . " " I 've thought of that . " Powell 's fingers went up to his long-suffering mustache and clanged uselessly against the transparent visor . " Of course , we could get Dave to digus out easily in that time , except that our precious emergencymust have thrown him off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't that nice . " Donovan edged up to the opening and managed to get his metal-incased head out . It was an extremely tight fit . " Hey , Greg ! " " What ? " " Suppose we get Dave within twenty feet . He 'll snap to normal . That will save us . " " Sure , but where is he ? " " Down the corridor  --  way down . For Pete 's sake , stop pulling before you drag my head out of its socket . I 'll give you your chance to look . " Powell maneuvered his head outside , " We did it all right . Look at those saps . That must be a ballet they 're doing . " " Never mind the side remarks . Are they getting any closer ? " " Ca n't tell yet . They 're too far away . Give me a chance . Pass me my flash , will you ? I 'll try to attract their attention that way . " He gave up after two minutes , " Not a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting toward us . What do you know ? " Donovan said , " Hey , let me see ! " There was a silent scuffle . Powell said , " All right ! " and Donovan got his head out . They were approaching . Dave was high-stepping the way in front and the six " fingers " were a weaving chorus line behind him . Donovan marveled , " What are they doing ? That 's what I want to know . It looks like the Virginia reel  --  and Dave 's a major-domo , or I never saw one . " " Oh , leave me alone with your descriptions , " grumbled Powell . " How near are they ? " 106 I , ROBOT " Within fifty feet and coming this way . We 'll be out in fifteen min  --  Uh  --  huh  --  HUH  --  HEY-Y ! " " What 's going on ? " It took Powell several seconds to recover from his stunned astonishment at Donovan 's vo- cal gyrations . " Come on , give me a chance at that hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He fought his way upward , but Donovan kicked wildly , " They did an about-face , Greg . They 're leaving . Dave ! Hey , Da-a-ave ! " Powell shrieked , " What 's the use of that , you fool ? Sound wo n't carry . " " Well , then , " panted Donovan , " kick the walls , slam them , get some vibration started . We 've got to attract their attention somehow , Greg , or we 're through . " He pounded like a madman . Powell shook him , " Wait , Mike , wait . Listen , I 've got an idea . Jumping Jupiter , this is a fine time to get around to the simple solutions . Mike ! " " What do you want ? " Donovan pulled his head in . " Let me in there fast before they get out of range . " " Out of range ! What are you going to do ? Hey , what are you going to do with that detonator ? " He grabbed Powell 's arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do a little shooting . " " Why ? " " That 's for later . Let 's sec if it works first . If it does n't , then  --  Get out of the way and let me shoot ! " The robots were flickers , small and getting smaller , in the distance . Powell lined up the sights tensely , and pulled the trigger three times . He lowered the guns and peered anxiously . One of the subsidiaries was down ! There were only six gleaming figures now . Powell called into his transmitter uncertainly . " Dave ! " A pause , then the answer sounded to both men , " Boss ? % &; v+L +++Laa SSLa+/+/11 1V /Where are you ? My third subsidiary has had his chest blown in . He 's out of commission . " " Never mind your subsidiary , " said Powell . " We 're trapped in a cave-in where you were blasting . Can you see our flashlight ? " " Sure . We 'll be right there . " Powell sat back and relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Donovan said very softly with tears in his voice , " All right , Greg . You win . I beat my forehead against the ground before your feet . Now do n't feed me any bull . Just tell me quietly what it 's all about . " " Easy . It 's just that all through we missed the obvious  --  as usual . We knew it was the personal initiative circuit , and that it always happened during emergencies , but we kept looking for a specific order as the cause . Why should it be an order ? " " Why not ? " " Well , look . Why not a type of order . What type of order requires the most initiative ? What type of order would occur almost always only in an emergency ? " " Do n't ask me , Greg . Tell me ! " " I 'm doing it ! It 's the six-way order . Under all ordinary conditions , one or more of the fingers ' would be doing routine tasks requiring no close supervision  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the routine walking motions . But in an emergency , all six subsidiaries must be mobilized immediately and simultaneously . Dave must handle six robots at a time and something gives . The rest was easy . Any decrease in initiative required , such as the arrival of humans , snaps him back . So I destroyed one of the robots . When I did , he was transmitting only five-way orders . Initiative decreases  --  he 's normal . " " Flow did you get all that ? " demanded Donovan . " Just logical guessing . I tried it and it worked . " The robot 's voice was in their ears again , " Here I am . Can you hold out half an hour ? " 108 I , ROBOT " Easy ! " said Powell . Then , to Donovan , he continued , " And now the job should be simple . We 'll go through the circuits , and check off each part that gets an extra workout in a six-way order as against a five-way . How big a field does that leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think . If Dave is like the preliminary model we saw back at the factory , there 's a special co-ordinating circuit that would be the only section involved . " He cheered up suddenly and amazingly , " Say , that would n't be bad at all . There 's nothing to that . " " All right . You think it over and we 'll check the blueprintswhen we get back . And now , till Dave reaches us , I 'm relaxing . " " Hey , wait ! Just tell me one thing . What were those queer shifting marches , those funny dance steps , that the robots went through every time they went screwy . " " That ? I do n't know . But I 've got a notion . Remember , those subsidiaries were Dave 's fingers . ' We were alwayssaying that , you know . Well , it 's my idea that in all these interludes , whenever Dave became a psychiatric case , he went off into a moronic maze , spending his time twiddlinghis fingers . " Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but warmth came into her voice when she mentioned robots . It did n't take her long to go through the Speedies , the Cuties and the Daves , and I stopped her . Otherwise , she would have dredged up half a dozen more . I said , " Does n't anything ever happen on Earth ? " She looked at me with a little frown , " No , we do n't have much to do with robots in action here on Earth . " " Oh , well that 's too bad . I mean , your field-engineers are swell , but ca n't we get you into this ? Did n't you ever have a robot go wrong on you ? It 's your anniversary , you know . " CATCH THAT RABBIT 109And so help me she blushed . She said , " Robots have gone wrong on me . Heavens , how long it 's been since I thought of it . Why , it was almost forty years ago .

His gray eyebrowshunched low as he spoke between puffs . " It reads minds all right  --  damn little doubt about that ! But why ? " He looked at Mathematician Peter Bogert , " Well ? " Bogert flattened his black hair down with both hands , " That was the thirty-fourth RB model we 've turned out , Lanning . All the others were strictly orthodox . " The third man at the table frowned . Milton Ashe was the youngest officer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud of his post . " Listen , Bogert . There was n't a hitch in the assembly from start to finish . I guarantee that . " Bogert 's thick lips spread in a patronizing smile , " Do you ? If you can answer for the entire assembly line , I recommend your promotion . By exact count , there are seventy-five thousand , two hundred and thirty-four operationsnecessary for the manufacture of a single positronic brain , each separate operation depending for successful completion upon any number of factors , from five to a hundred and five . If any one of them goes seriously wrong , 111112 I , ROBOTthe brain ' is ruined . I quote our own information folder , Ashe . " Milton Ashe flushed , but a fourth voice cut off his reply . " If we 're going to start by trying to fix the blame on one another , I 'm leaving . " Susan Calvin 's hands were folded tightly in her lap , and the little lines about her thin , pale lips deepened , " We 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as rather important that we find out just why it reads minds . We 're not going to do that by saying , Your fault ! My fault ! ' " Her cold gray eyes fastened upon Ashe , and he grinned . Lanning grinned too , and , as always at such times , his long white hair and shrewd little eyes made him the picture of a biblical patriarch , " True for you , Dr. Calvin . " His voice became suddenly crisp , " Here 's everything in pill-concentrate form . We 've produced a positronic brain of supposedly ordinary vintage that 's got the remarkable property of being able to tune in on thought waves . It would mark the most important advance in robotics in decades , if we knew how it happened . We do n't , and we have to find out . Is that clear ? " " May I make a suggestion ? " asked Bogert . " Go ahead ! " " I 'd say that until we do figure out the mess  --  and as a mathematician I expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we keep the existence of RB-34 a secret . I mean even from the other members of the staff . As heads of the departments , we ought not to find it an insoluble problem , and the fewer know about it  --  " " Bogert is right , " said Dr. Calvin . " Ever since the InterplanetaryCode was modified to allow robot models to be tested in the plants before being shipped out to space , anti-robot propaganda has increased . If any word leaks out about a robot being able to read minds before we can announce complete control of the phenomenon , pretty effectivecapital could be made out of it . Lanning sucked at his cigar and nodded gravely . He turned to Ashe , " I think you said you were alone when you first stumbled on this thought-reading business . " " I 'll say I was alone  --  I got the scare of my life . RB 34 had just been taken off the assembly table and they sent him down to me . Obermann was off somewheres , so I took him down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take him down . " Ashe paused , and a tiny smile tugged at his lips , " Say , did any of you ever carry on a thought conversation without knowing it ? " No one bothered to answer , and he continued , " You do n't realize it at first , you know . He just spoke to measlogically and sensibly as you can imagine  --  and it was only when I was most of the way down to the testing rooms that I realized that I had n't said anything . Sure , I had thought lots , but that is n't the same thing , is it ? I locked that thing up and ran for Lanning . Having it walkingbeside me , calmly peering into my thoughts and pickingand choosing among them gave me the willies . " " I imagine it would , " said Susan Calvin thoughtfully . Her eyes fixed themselves upon Ashe in an oddly intent manner . " We are so accustomed to considering our own thoughts private . " Lanning broke in impatiently , " Then only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to go about this systematically . Ashe , I want you to check over the assembly line from beginning to end  --  everything .

" " Tall order , " grunted Ashe . " Naturally ! Of course , you 're to put the men under you to work on this  --  every single one if you have to , and I do n't care if we go behind schedule , either . But they 're not to know why , you understand . " " Hm-m-m , yes ! " The young technician grinned wryly . " It 's still a lulu of a job . " 114 I , ROBOT Lanning swiveled about in his chair and faced Calvin , " You 'll have to tackle the job from the other direction .

" He puffed violently at his cigar and mumbled the rest through the smoke , " Bogert will help me there , of course . " Bogert polished the nails of one pudgy hand with the other and said blandly , " I dare say . I know a little in the line . " " Well ! I 'll get started . " Ashe shoved his chair back and rose . His pleasantly youthful face crinkled in a grin , " I 've got the darnedest job of any of us , so I 'm getting out of here and to work . " He left with a slurred , " B ' seem ' ye !

She paused to readjust the huge " No Entrance " sign upon the door and then approached the robot . " I 've brought you the texts upon hyperatomic motors , Herbie  --  a few anyway . Would you care to look at them ? " RB-34  --  otherwise known as Herbie  --  lifted the three heavy books from her arms and opened to the title page of one : " Hm-m-m ! Theory of Hyperatomics . ' " He mumbled inarticulately to himself as he flipped the pages and then spoke with an abstracted air , " Sit down , Dr. Calvin ! This will take me a few minutes . " The psychologist seated herself and watched Herbie narrowlyas he took a chair at the other side of the table and went through the three books systematically . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Of course , I know why you brought these . " The corner of Dr. Calvin 's lip twitched , " I was afraid you would . It 's difficult to work with you , Herbie . You 're always a step ahead of me . " " It 's the same with these books , you know , as with the others . They just do n't interest me . There 's nothing to your textbooks . Your science is just a mass of collected data plastered together by make-shift theory  --  and all so incredibly simple , that it 's scarcely worth bothering about . " It 's your fiction that interests me . Your studies of the interplay of human motives and emotions "  --  his mighty hand gestured vaguely as he sought the proper words . Dr. Calvin whispered , " I think I understand . " " I see into minds , you see , " the robot continued , " and you have no idea how complicated they are . I ca n't begin to understand everything because my own mind has so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your novels help . " " Yes , but I 'm afraid that after going through some of the harrowing emotional experiences of our present-day sentimental novel "  --  there was a tinge of bitterness in her voice  --  " you find real minds like ours dull and colorless . " " But I do n't ! " The sudden energy in the response brought the other to her feet . She felt herself reddening , and thought wildly , " He must know ! " Herbie subsided suddenly , and muttered in a low voice from which the metallic timbre departed almost entirely , " But , of course , I know about it , Dr. Calvin . You think of it always , so how can I help but know . " 116 I , ROBOT LIAR ! 117Her face was hard . " Have you  --  told anyone ? " " Of course not ! " This , with genuine surprise . " No one has asked me . " " Well , then , " she flung out , " I suppose you think I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotion . " " Perhaps that is why it is so foolish . " The wistfulness in her voice drowned out everything else . Some of the woman peered through the layer of doctorhood . " I am not what you would call  --  attractive . " " If you are referring to mere physical attraction , I could n't judge . But I know , in any case , that there are other types of attraction . " " Nor young . " Dr. Calvin had scarcely heard the robot . " You are not yet forty . " An anxious insistence had crept into Herbie 's voice . " Thirty-eight as you count the years ; a shriveled sixty as far as my emotional outlook on life is concerned . Am I a psychologist for nothing ? " She drove on with bitter breathlessness , " And he 's barely thirty-five and looks and acts younger . Do you suppose he ever sees me as anything but . . . but what I am ? " " You are wrong ! Ilcrbic 's steel fist struck the plastictoppedtable with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan Calvin whirled on him now and the hunted pain in her eyes became a blaze , " Why should I ? What do you know about it all , anyway , you . . . you machine . I 'm just a specimen to you ; an interesting bug with a peculiarmind spread-eagled for inspection . It 's a wonderful example of frustration , is n't it ? Almost as good as your books . " Her voice , emerging in dry sobs , choked into silence . The robot cowered at the outburst . He shook his head pleadingly . " Wo n't you listen to me , please ? I could help you if you would let me . " " How ? " Her lips curled . " By giving me good advice ? " " No , not that . It 's just that I know what other people think  --  Milton Ashe , for instance . " There was a long silence , and Susan Calvin 's eyes dropped . " I do n't want to know what he thinks , " she gasped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know what he thinks . " Her head remained bent , but her breath came more quickly . " You are talking nonsense , " she whispered . " Why should I ? I am trying to help . Milton Ashe 's thoughts of you  --  " he paused . And then the psychologist raised her head , " Well ? " The robot said quietly , " He loves you . " For a full minute , Dr. Calvin did not speak . She merely stared . Then , " You are mistaken ! You must be . Why should he ? " " But he does . A thing like that can not be hidden , not from me . " " But I am so . . . so  --  " she stammered to a halt . " He looks deeper than the skin , and admires intellect in others . Milton Ashe is not the type to marry a head of hair and a pair of eyes . " Susan Calvin found herself blinking rapidly and waited before speaking . Even then her voice trembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " " Have you ever given him a chance ? " " How could I ? I never thought that  --  " " Exactly ! " The psychologist paused in thought and then looked up suddenly . " A girl visited him here at the plant half a year ago . She was pretty , I suppose  --  blond and slim . And , of course , could scarcely add two and two . He spent all day puffing out his chest , trying to explain how a robot was put together . " The hardness had returned , " Not that she understood ! Who was she ? " Herbie answered without hesitation , " I know the personyou are referring to . She is his first cousin , and there is no romantic interest there , I assure you . " 118 I , ROBOT LIAR ! 119Susan Calvin rose to her feet with a vivacity almost girlish . " Now is n't that strange ? That 's exactly what I used to pretend to myself sometimes , though I never really thought so . Then it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized his cold , heavy hand in both hers . " Thank you , Herbie . " Her voice was an urgent , husky whisper . " Do n't tell anyone about this . Let it be our secret  --  and thank you again . " With that , and a convulsivesqueeze of Herbie 's unresponsive metal fingers , she left . Herbie turned slowly to his neglected novel , but there was no one to read his thoughts . Milton Ashe stretched slowly and magnificently , to the tune of cracking joints and a chorus of grunts , and then glared at Peter Bogert , Ph.D . " Say , " he said , " I 've been at this for a week now with just about no sleep . How long do I have to keep it up ? I thought you said the positronic bombardment in Vac Chamber D was the solution . " Bogert yawned delicately and regarded his white hands with interest . " It is . I 'm on the track . " " I know what that means when a mathematician says it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all depends . " " On what ? " Ashc dropped into a chair and stretched his long legs out before him . " On Lanning . The old fellow disagrees with me . " He sighed , " A bit behind the times , that 's the trouble with him . He clings to matrix mechanics as the all in all , and this problem calls for more powerful mathematical tools . He 's so stubborn . " Ashe muttered sleepily , " Why not ask Herbie and settle the whole affair . " " Ask the robot ? " Bogert 's eyebrows climbed . " Why not ? Did n't the old girl tell you ? " " You mean Calvin ? " " Yeah ! Susie herself . That robot 's a mathematical wiz . He knows all about everything plus a bit on the side . He does triple integrals in his head and eats up tensor analysis for dessert . " The mathematician stared skeptically , " Are you seri-ous ? " " So help me ! The catch is that the dope does n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You should see the tripe Susie keeps feeding him : Purple Passion ' and Love in Space . ' " " Dr. Calvin has n't said a word of this to us . " " Well , she has n't finished studying him . You know how she is . She likes to have everything just so before letting out the big secret . " " She 's told you . " " We sort of got to talking . I have been seeing a lot of her lately . " He opened his eyes wide and frowned , " Say , Bogie , have you been noticing anything queer about the lady lately ? " Bogert relaxed into an undignified grin , " She 's using lipstick , if that 's what you mean . " " Hell , I know that . Rouge , powder and eye shadow , too . She 's a sight . But it 's not that . I ca n't put my finger on it . It 's the way she talks  --  as if she were happy about something . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed himself a leer , which , for a scientist past fifty , was not a bad job , " Maybe she 's in love . " Ashe allowed his eyes to close again , " You 're nuts , Bogie . You go speak to Herbie ; I want to stay here and go to sleep . " " Right ! Not that I particularly like having a robot tell me my job , nor that I think he can do it ! " A soft snore was his only answer . Herbie listened carefully as Peter Bogert , hands in pockets , spoke with elaborate indifference . " So there you are . I 've been told you understand these120 I , ROBOT things , and I am asking you more in curiosity than any- thing else . My line of reasoning , as I have outlined it , involves a few doubtful steps , I admit , which Dr. Lan- ning refuses to accept , and the picture is still rather in- complete . " The robot did n't answer , and Bogert said , " Well ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scribbled fig- ures . " I do n't suppose you can go any further than that ? " " I dare n't try . You are a better mathematician than I , and  --  well , I 'd hate to commit myself . " There was a shade of complacency in Bogert 's smile , " I rather thought that would be the case . It is deep . We 'll forget it . " He crumpled the sheets , tossed them down the waste shaft , turned to leave , and then thought better of it . " By the way  --  " The robot waited . Bogert seemed to have difficulty . " There is something  --  that is , perhaps you can  --  " He stopped . Herbie spoke quietly . " Your thoughts are confused , but there is no doubt at all that they concern Dr. Lanning . It is silly to hesitate , for as soon as you compose yourself , I 'll know what it is you want to ask . " The mathematician 's hand went to his sleek hair in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , as if that explained everything . " I know that . " " And he 's been director of the plant for almost thirty years . " Herbie nodded . " Well , now , " Bogert 's voice became ingratiating , " you would know whether . . . whether he 's thinking of re- signing . Health , perhaps , or some other  --  " " Quite , " said Herbie , and that was all . " Well , do you know . " " Certainly . " " Then  --  uh  --  could you tell me ? " " Since you ask , yes . " The robot was quite matter-of-fact about it . " He has already resigned ! " " What ! " The exclamation was an explosive , almost inarticulate , sound . The scientist 's large head hunched forward , " Say that again ! " " He has already resigned , " came the quiet repetition , " but it has not yet taken effect . He is waiting , you see , to solve the problem of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite ready to turn the office of director over to his suc-cessor . " Bogert expelled his breath sharply , " And this successor ? Who is he ? " He was quite close to Herbie now , eyes fixed fascinatedly on those unreadable dull-red photoelectric cells that were the robot 's eyes . Words came slowly , " You are the next director . " And Bogert relaxed into a tight smile , " This is good to know . I 've been hoping and waiting for this . Thanks , Herbie . " Peter Bogert was at his desk until five that morning and he was back at nine . The shelf just over the desk emptied of its row of reference books and tables , as he referred to one after the other . The pages of calculations before him increased microscopically and the crumpled sheets at his feet mounted into a hill of scribbled paper . At precisely noon , he stared at the final page , rubbed a blood-shot eye , yawned and shrugged . " This is getting worse each minute . Damn ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noddedat Lanning , who entered , cracking the knuckles of one gnarled hand with the other . The director took in the disorder of the room and his eyebrows furrowed together . " New lead ? " he asked . " No , " came the defiant answer . " What 's wrong with the old one ? " Lanning did not trouble to answer , nor to do more than122 I , ROBOT bestow a single cursory glance at the top sheet upon Bogert 's desk . He spoke through the flare of a match as he lit a cigar . " Has Calvin told you about the robot ? It 's a mathe- matical genius . Really remarkable . " The other snorted loudly , " So I 've heard . But Calvin had better stick to robopsychology . I 've checked Herbie on math , and he can scarcely struggle through calculus . " " Calvin did n't find it so . " " She 's crazy . " " And I do n't find it so . " The director 's eyes narrowed dangerously . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you talking about ? " " I 've been putting Herbie through his paces all morning , and he can do tricks you never heard of . " " Is that so ? " " You sound skeptical ! " Lanning flipped a sheet of paper out of his vest pocket and unfolded it . " That 's not my handwriting , is it ? " Bogert studied the large angular notation covering the sheet , " Herbic did this ? " " Right ! And if you 'll notice , he 's been working on your time integration of Equation 22 . It comes "  --  Lanning tapped a yellow fingernail upon the last step  --  " to the identical conclusion I did , and in a quarter the time . You had no right to neglect the Linger Effect in positronic born- bardment . " " I did n't neglect it . For Heaven 's sake , Lanning , get it through your head that it would cancel out  --  " " Oh , sure , you explained that . You used the Mitchell Translation Equation , did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why not ? " " Because you 've been using hyper-imaginaries , for one thing . " " What 's that to do with it ? " " Mitchell 's Equation wo n't hold when  --  " " Are you crazy ? If you 'll reread Mitchell 's original paper in the Transactions of the Far  --  " " I do n't have to . I told you in the beginning that I did n't like his reasoning , and Herbie backs me in that . " " Well , then , " Bogert shouted , " let that clockwork contraptionsolve the entire problem for you . Why bother with nonessentials ? " " That 's exactly the point . Herbie ca n't solve the problem . And if he ca n't , we ca n't  --  alone . I 'm submitting the entire question to the National Board . It 's gotten beyond us . " Bogert 's chair went over backward as he jumped up a-snarl , face crimson . " You 're doing nothing of the sort . " Lanning flushed in his turn , " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Exactly , " was the gritted response . " I 've got the problembeaten and you 're not to take it out of my hands , understand ? Do n't think I do n't see through you , you desiccated fossil . You 'd cut your own nose off before you 'd let me get the credit for solving robotic telepathy . " " You 're a damned idiot , Bogert , and in one second I 'll have you suspended for insubordination "  --  Lanning 's lower lip trembled with passion . " Which is one thing you wo n't do , Lanning . You have n't any secrets with a mind-reading robot around , so do n't forgetthat I know all about your resignation . " The ash on Lanning 's cigar trembled and fell , and the cigar itself followed , " What . . . what  --  " Bogert chuckled nastily , " And I 'm the new director , be it understood . I 'm very aware of that ; do n't think I 'm not . Damn your eyes , Lanning , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the sweetest mess that you 've ever been in . " Lanning found his voice and let it out with a roar . " You 're suspended , d'ye hear ? You 're relieved of all duties . You 're broken , do you understand ? " The smile on the other 's face broadened , " Now , what's124 I , ROBOT the use of that ? You 're getting nowhere . I 'm holding the trumps . I know you 've resigned . Herbie told me , and he got it straight from you . " Lanning forced himself to speak quietly . He looked an old , old man , with tired eyes peering from a face in which the red had disappeared , leaving the pasty yellow of age behind , " I want to speak to Herbie . I Ic ca n't have told you anything of the sort . You 're playing a deep game , Bogert , but I 'm calling your bluff . Come with me . " Bogert shrugged , " To see Herbie ? Good ! Damned good ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from his clumsy sketch and said , " You get the idea ? I 'm not too good at getting this down , but that 's about how it looks . It 's a honey of a house , and I can get it for next to nothing . " Susan Calvin gazed across at him with melting eyes . " It 's really beautiful , " she sighed . " I 've often thought that I 'd like to  --  " Her voice trailed away . " Of course , " Ashe continued briskly , putting away his pencil , " I 've got to wait for my vacation . It 's only two weeks off , but this IIcrbic business has everything up in the air . " His eyes dropped to his fingernails , " Besides , there 's another point  --  but it 's a secret . " " Then do n't tell mc . " " Oh , I 'd just as soon , I 'm just busting to tell someone  --  and you 're just about the best  --  er  --  confidante I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heart bounded , but she did not trust herself to speak . " Frankly , " Ashe scraped his chair closer and lowered his voice into a confidential whisper , " the house is n't to be only for myself . I 'm getting married ! " And then he jumped out of his seat , " What 's the matter ? " " Nothing ! " The horrible spinning sensation had van- ished , but it was hard to get words out . " Married ? You mean  --  " " Why , sure ! About time , is n't it ? You remember that girl who was here last summer . That 's she ! But you are sick . You  --  " " Headache ! " Susan Calvin motioned him away weakly . " I 've . . . I 've been subject to them lately . I want to .. . to congratulate you , of course . I 'm very glad  --  " The inexpertlyapplied rouge made a pair of nasty red splotches upon her chalk-white face . Things had begun spinning again . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mumble , as she stumbled blindly out the door . It had happened with the sudden catastrophe of a dream  --  and with all the unreal horror of a dream . But how could it be ? Herbie had saidAnd Herbie knew ! He could see into minds ! She found herself leaning breathlessly against the door jamb , staring into Herbie 's metal face . She must have climbed the two flights of stairs , but she had no memory of it . The distance had been covered in an instant , as in a dream . As in a dream ! And still Herbie 's unblinking eyes stared into hers and their dull red seemed to expand into dimly shining nightmarishglobes . He was speaking , and she felt the cold glass pressing against her lips . She swallowed and shuddered into a certainawareness of her surroundings . Still Herbie spoke , and there was agitation in his voiceasif he were hurt and frightened and pleading . The words were beginning to make sense . " This is a dream , " he was saying , " and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real world soon and laugh at yourself . He loves you , I tell you . He does , he does ! But not here ! Not now ! This is all illusion . " Susan Calvin nodded , her voice a whisper , " Yes ! Yes ! " 126 I , ROBOT She was clutching Herbie 's arm , clinging to it , repeating over and over , " It is n't true , is it ? It is n't , is it ? " just how she came to her senses , she never knew  --  but it was like passing from a world of misty unreality to one of harsh sunlight . She pushed him away from her , pushed hard against that steely arm , and her eyes were wide . " What are you trying to do ? " Her voice rose to a harsh scream . " What are you trying to do ? " Herbie backed away , " I want to help . " The psychologist stared , " Help ? By telling me this is a dream ? By trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized her , " This is no dream ! I wish it were ! " She drew her breath sharply , " Wait ! Why ... why , I understand . Merciful Heavens , it 's so obvious . " There was horror in the robot 's voice , " I had to ! " " And I believed you ! I never thought  --  " Loud voices outside the door brought her to a halt . She turned away , fists clenching spasmodically , and when Bogert and Lanning entered , she was at the far window . Neither of the men paid her the slightest attention . They appoached Herbic simultaneously ; Lanning angry and impatient , Bogert , coolly sardonic . The director spoke first . " Here now , Herbie . Listen to me ! " The robot brought his eyes sharply down upon the aged director , " Yes , Dr. Lanning . " " Have you discussed me with Dr. Bogert ? " " No , sir . " The answer came slowly , and the smile on Bogert 's face flashed off . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his superior and straddled the ground before the robot . " Repeat what you told me yesterday . " " I said that  --  " Herbie fell silent . Deep within him his metallic diaphragm vibrated in soft discords . " Did n't you say he had resigned ? " roared Bogert . " Answerme ! " Bogert raised his arm frantically , but Lanning pushed him aside , " Are you trying to bully him into lying ? " " You heard him , Lanning . He began to say Yes ' and stopped . Get out of my way ! I want the truth out of him , understand ! " " I 'll ask him ! " Lanning turned to the robot . " All right , Herbie , take it easy . Have I resigned ? " Herbie stared , and Lanning repeated anxiously , " Have I resigned ? " There was the faintest trace of a negative shake of the robot 's head . A long wait produced nothing further . The two men looked at each other and the hostility in their eyes was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blurted Bogert , " has the robot gone mute ? Ca n't you speak , you monstrosity ? " " I can speak , " came the ready answer . " Then answer the question . Did n't you tell me Lanning had resigned ? Has n't he resigned ? " And again there was nothing but dull silence , until from the end of the room , Susan Calvin 's laugh rang out suddenly , high-pitched and semi-hysterical . The two mathematicians jumped , and Bogert 's eyes narrowed , " You here ? What 's so funny ? " " Nothing 's funny . " Her voice was not quite natural . " It 's just that I 'm not the only one that 's been caught . There 's irony in three of the greatest experts in robotics in the world falling into the same elementary trap , is n't there ? " Her voice faded , and she put a pale hand to her forehead , " But it is n't funny ! " This time the look that passed between the two men was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Lanning stiffly . " Is something wrong with Herbie ? " " No , " she approached them slowly , " nothing is wrong with him  --  only with us . " She whirled suddenly and128 I , ROBOTshrieked at the robot , " Get away from me ! Go to the other end of the room and do n't let me look at you . " Herbie cringed before the fury of her eyes and stumbledaway in a clattering trot . Lanning 's voice was hostile , " What is all this , Dr. Cal-vin ? " She faced them and spoke sarcastically , " Surely you know the fundamental First Law of Robotics . " The other two nodded together . " Certainly , " said Bogert , irritably , " a robot may not injure a human being or , through inaction , allow him to come to harm . " " How nicely put , " sneered Calvin . " But what kind of harm ? " " Why  --  any kind . " " Exactly ! Any kind ! But what about hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about the blastingof one 's hopes ? Is that injury ? " Lanning frowned , " What would a robot know about  --  " And then he caught himself with a gasp . " You 've caught on , have you ? This robot reads minds . Do you suppose it does n't know everything about mental injury ? Do you suppose that if asked a question , it would n't give exactly that answer that one wants to hear ? Would n't any other answer hurt us , and would n't Ilerbie know that ? " " Good Heavens ! " muttered Bogert . The psychologist cast a sardonic glance at him , " I take it you asked him whether Lanning had resigned . You wanted to hear that lie had resigned and so that 's what Herbie told you . " " And I suppose that is why , " said Lanning , tonelessly , " it would not answer a little while ago . It could n't answer either way without hurting one of us . " There was a short pause in which the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair by the bookcase , head resting in one hand . Susan Calvin stared steadfastly at the floor , " He knew of all this . That . . . that devil knows everything  --  in-LIAR ! 129eluding what went wrong in his assembly . " Her eyes were dark and brooding . Lanning looked up , " You 're wrong there , Dr. Calvin . He does n't know what went wrong . I asked him . " " What does that mean ? " cried Calvin . " Only that you did n't want him to give you the solution . It would punctureyour ego to have a machine do what you could n't . Did you ask him ? " she shot at Bogert . " In a way . " Bogert coughed and reddened . " He told me he knew very little about mathematics . " Lanning laughed , not very loudly and the psychologist smiled caustically . She said , " I 'll ask him ! A solution by him wo n't hurt my ego . " She raised her voice into a cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and approached with hesitant steps . " You know , I suppose , " she continued , " just exactly at what point in the assembly an extraneous factor was introducedor an essential one left out . " " Yes , " said Herbie , in tones barely heard . " Hold on , " broke in Bogert angrily . " That 's not necessarilytrue . You want to hear that , that 's all . " " Do n't be a fool , " replied Calvin . " He certainly knows as much math as you and Lanning together , since he can read minds . Give him his chance . " The mathematician subsided , and Calvin continued , " All right , then , Herbie , give ! We 're waiting . " And in an aside , " Get pencils and paper , gentlemen . " But Herbie remained silent , and there was triumph inthe psychologist 's voice , " Why do n't you answer , Herbie ? " The robot blurted out suddenly , " I can not . You know Icannot ! Dr. Bogert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They want the solution . " " But not from me . " Lanning broke in , speaking slowly and distinctly , " Do n't be foolish , Herbie . We do want you to tell us . " Bogert nodded curtly . Herbie 's voice rose to wild heights , " What 's the use ofLIAR ! 131It was like the whistling of a piccolo many times magnified  --  shrilland shriller till it keened with the terror of a lost soul and filled the room with the piercingness of itself . And when it died into nothingness , Herbie collapsed into a huddled heap of motionless metal . Bogert 's face was bloodless , " He 's dead ! " " No ! " Susan Calvin burst into body-racking gusts of wild laughter , " not dead  --  merely insane . I confronted him with the insoluble dilemma , and he broke down . You can scrap him now  --  because he 'll never speak again . " Lanning was on his knees beside the thing that had been Herbie . His fingers touched the cold , unresponsive metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . " He rose and faced her , face contorted . " What if I did ? You ca n't help it now . " And in a sudden access of bitterness , " He deserved it . " The director seized the paralysed , motionless Bogert by the wrist , " What 's the difference . Come , Peter . " He sighed , " A thinking robot of this type is worthless anyway . " His eyes were old and tired , and he repeated , " Come , Peter ! " It was minutes after the two scientists left that Dr. Susan Calvin regained part of her mental equilibrium . Slowly , her eyes turned to the living-dead Herbie and the tightnessreturned to her face . Long she stared while the triumph faded and the helpless frustration returned  --  and of all her turbulent thoughts only one infinitely bitter word passed her lips . " Liar ! " That finished it for then , naturally . I knew I could n't get any more out of her after that . She just sat there behind her desk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Thank you , Dr. Calvin !

Down below , you do n't want me to . I 'm a machine , given the imitation of life only by virtue of the positronic interplay in my brain  --  which is man 's device . You ca n't lose face to me without being hurt . That is deep in your mind and wo n't be erased . I ca n't give the solution . " " We 'll leave , " said Dr. Lanning . " Tell Calvin . " " That would make no difference , " cried Herbie , " since you would know anyway that it was I that was supplying1- 're answer .

" " And if you tell them that will hurt them , too . " " Yes ! Yes ! " Herbie was retreating slowly , and step by step Susan Calvin advanced . The two men watched in frozen bewilderment . " You ca n't tell them , " droned the psychologist slowly , " because that would hurt and you must n't hurt . But if you do n't tell them , you hurt , so you must tell them . And if you do , you will hurt and you must n't , so you ca n't tell them ; but if you do n't , you hurt , so you must ; but if you do , you hurt , so you must n't ; but if you do n't , you hurt , so you must ; but if you do , you  --  " Herbie was up against the wall , and here he dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

SIXLITTLE LOST ROBOTWHEN I did see Susan Calvin again , it was at the door of her office . Files were being moved out . She said , " How are your articles coming along , young man ? " " Fine , " I said . I had put them into shape according to my own lights , dramatized the bare bones of her recital , added the conversation and little touches , " Would you look over them and see if I have n't been libellous or too unreasonably inaccurate anywhere ? " " I suppose so . Shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have coffee . " She seemed in good humor , so I chanced it as we walked down the corridor , " I was wondering , Dr. Calvin  --  " " Yes ? " " If you would tell me more concerning the history of robotics . " " Surely you have what you want , young man . " " In a way . But these incidents I have written up do n't apply much to the modern world . I mean , there was only one mind-reading robot ever developed , and Space-Stations are already outmoded and in disuse , and robot mining is taken for granted . What about interstellar travel ? It 's only been about twenty years since the hyperatomic motor was133134 I , ROBOT invented and it 's well known that it was a robotic inven- tion . What is the truth about it ? " " Interstellar travel ? " She was thoughtful . We were in the lounge , and I ordered a full dinner . She just had coffee . " It was n't a simple robotic invention , you know ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until we developed the Brain , we did n't get very far . But we tried ; we really tried . My first connection ( directly , that is ) with interstellar research was in 2029 , when a robot was lost  --  Measures on Hyper Base had been taken in a sort of rattling fury  --  the muscular equivalent of an hysterical shriek . To itemize them in order of both chronology and des- peration , they were : i . All work on the Hyperatomic Drive through all the space volume occupied by the Stations of the Twenty- Seventh Asteroidal Grouping came to a halt . That entire volume of space was nipped out of the System , practically speaking . No one entered without permission . No one left under any conditions . By special government patrol ship , Drs . Susan Cal- vin and Peter Bogert , respectively IIead Psychologist and Mathematical Director of United States Robot &; Me- chanical Men Corporation , were brought to Hyper Base . Susan Calvin had never left the surface of Earth before , and had no perceptible desire to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a clearly coming Hyperatomic Drive , she remained quietly provincial . So she was dis- satisfied with her trip and unconvinced of the emergency , and every line of her plain , middle-aged face showed it clearly enough during her first dinner at Hyper Base . Nor did Dr. Bogert 's sleek paleness abandon a certain hangdog attitude . Nor did Major-general Kallner , who headed the projedt , even once forget to maintain a haunted expression . In short , it was a grisly episode , that meal , and the little session of three that followed began in a gray , unhappy manner . Kallner , with his baldness glistening , and his dress uniformoddly unsuited to the general mood , began with uneasy directness . " This is a queer story to tell , sir , and madam . I want to thank you for coming on short notice and without a reason being given . ' We 'll try to correct that now . We 've lost a robot . Work has stopped and must stop until such time as we locate it . So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . " Perhaps the general felt his predicament anticlimactic . He continued with a note of desperation , " I need n't tell you the importance of our work here . More than eighty percent of last year 's appropriations for scientific research have gone to us  --  " " Why , we know that , " said Bogert , agreeably . " U. S. Robots is receiving a generous rental fee for use of our robots . " Susan Calvin injected a blunt , vinegary note , " What makes a single robot so important to the project , and why has n't it been located ? " The general turned his red face toward her and wet his lips quickly , " Why , in , a manner of speaking we have locatedit . " Then , with near anguish , " Here , suppose I explain . As soon as the robot failed to report , a state of emergency was declared , and all movement off Hyper Base stopped . A cargo vessel had landed the previous day and had delivered us two robots for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . uh . . . same type for shipmentelsewhere . We are certain as to that figure . There is no question about it whatever . " " Yes ? And the connection ? " 136 I , ROBOT " When our missing robot failed of location anywhere  --  I assure you we would have found a missing blade of grass if it had been there to find  --  we brainstormed ourselves into counting the robots left on the cargo ship . They have sixty-three now . " " So that the sixty-third , I take it is the missing prodigal ? " Dr. Calvin 's eyes darkened . " Yes , but we have no way of telling which is the sixty-third . " There was a dead silence while the electric clock chimed eleven times , and then the robopsychologist said , " Very peculiar , " and the corners of her lips moved downward . " Peter , " she turned to her colleague with a trace of savagery , " what 's wrong here ? What kind of robots are they using at hyper Base ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rather a matter of delicacy till now , Susan . " She spoke rapidly , " Yes , till now . If there are sixty-three same-type robots , one of which is wanted and the identity of which can not be determined , why wo n't any of them do ? What 's the idea of all this ? Why have we been sent for ? " Bogert said in resigned fashion , " If you 'll give me a chance , Susan  --  Hyper Base happens to be using several robots whose brains arc not impressioncd with the entire First Law of Robotics . " " Are n't impressioned ? " Calvin slumped back in her chair , " I see . How many were made ? " " A few . It was on government order and there was no way of violating the secrecy . No one was to know except the top men directly concerned . You were n't included , Susan . It was nothing I had anything to do with . " The general interrupted with a measure of authority . " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware that Dr. Calvin was unacquainted with the situation . I need n't tell you , Dr. Calvin , that there always has been strong opposition to robots on the Planet . The only defense theLITTLE LOST ROBOT 137government has had against the Fundamentalist radicals in this matter was the fact that robots are always built with an unbreakable First Law  --  which makes it impossible for them to harm human beings under any circumstance . " But we had to have robots of a different nature . So just a few of the NS-2 model , the Nestors , that is , were prepared with a modified First Law . To keep it quiet , all NS-2 's are manufactured without serial numbers ; modified members are delivered here along with a group of normal robots ; and , of course , all our kind are under the strictest impressionment never to tell of their modification to unauthorizedpersonnel . " He wore an embarrassed smile , " This has all worked out against us now . " Calvin said grimly , " Have you asked each one who it is , anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded , " All sixty-three deny having worked here  --  and one is lying . " " Does the one you want show traces of wear ? The others , I take it , are factory-fresh . " " The one in question only arrived last month . It , and the two that have just arrived , were to be the last we needed . There 's no perceptible wear . " He shook his head slowly and his eyes were haunted again , " Dr. Calvin , we do n't dare let that ship leave . If the existence of non-First Law robots becomes general knowledge  --  " There seemed no way of avoiding understatement in the conclusion . " Destroy all sixty-three , " said the robopsychologist coldly and flatly , " and make an end of it . " Bogert drew back a corner of his mouth . " You mean destroy thirty thousand dollars per robot . I 'm afraid U. S. Robots would n't like that . We 'd better make an effort first , Susan , before we destroy anything . " " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I need facts . Exactlywhat advantage does Hyper Base derive from these modifiedrobots ? ' What factor made them desirable , general ? " Kallner ruffled his forehead and stroked it with an upwardgesture of his hand . " We had trouble with our previous138 I , ROBOTrobots . Our men work with hard radiations a good deal , you see . It 's dangerous , of course , but reasonable precautionsare taken . There have been only two accidents since we began and neither was fatal . However , it was impossible to explain that to an ordinary robot . The First Law states  --  I 'll quote it  --  ' No robot may harm a human being , or through inaction , allow a human being to come to harm . ' " That 's primary , Dr. Calvin . When it was necessary for one of our men to expose himself for a short period to a moderate gamma field , one that would have no physiologicaleffects , the nearest robot would dash in to drag him out . If the field were exceedingly weak , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robots were cleared out . If the field were a trifle stronger , the robot would never reach the technician concerned , since its positronic brain would collapse under gamma radiations  --  and then we would be out one expensive and hard-to-replace robot . " We tried arguing with them . Their point was that a human being in a gamma field was endangering his life and that it did n't matter that he could remain there half an hour safely . Supposing , they would say , he forgot and remainedan hour . They could n't take chances . We pointed out that they were risking their lives on a wild off-chance . But self-preservation is only the Third Law of Robotics  --  and the First Law of human safety came first . We gave them orders ; we ordered them strictly and harshly to remainout of gamma fields at whatever cost . But obedience is only the Second Law of Robotics  --  and the First Law of human safety came first . Dr. Calvin , we either had to do without robots , or do something about the First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't believe , " said Dr. Calvin , " that it was found possible to remove the First Law . " " It was n't removed , it was modified , " explained Kallner . " Positronic brains were constructed that contained the positive aspect only of the Law , which in them reads : No robot may harm a human being . ' That is all . They have noLITTLE LOST ROBOT 139compulsion to prevent one coming to harm through an extraneous agency such as gamma rays . I state the matter correctly , Dr. Bogert ? " " Quite , " assented the mathematician . " And that is the only difference of your robots from the ordinary NS-2 model ? The only difference ? Peter ? " " The only difference , Susan . " She rose and spoke with finality , " I intend sleeping now , and in about eight hours , I want to speak to whomever saw the robot last . And from now on , General Kallner , if I 'm to take any responsibility at all for events , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan Calvin , except for two hours of resentful lassitude , experienced nothing approaching sleep . She signaled at Bogert 's door at the local time of 0700 and found him also awake . He had apparently taken the trouble of transportinga dressing gown to Hyper Base with him , for he was sitting in it . He put his nail scissors down when Calvin entered . He said , softly , " I 've been expecting you more or less . I suppose you feel sick about all this . " " I do . " " Well  --  I 'm sorry . There was no way of preventing it . When the call came out from Hyper Base for us , I knew that something must have gone wrong with the modified Nestors . But what was there to do ? I could n't break the matter to you on the trip here as I would have liked to , because I had to be sure . The matter of the modification is top secret . " The psychologist muttered , " I should have been told . U. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way without the approval of a psychologist . " Bogert lifted his eyebrows and sighed , " Be reasonable , Susan . You could n't have influenced them . In this matter , the government was bound to have its way . They want the Hyperatomic Drive and the etheric physicists want robots that wo n't interfere with them . They were going to get140 I , ROBOT LITTLE LOST ROBOT 141them even if it did mean twisting the First Law . We had to admit it was possible from a construction standpoint and they swore a mighty oath that they wanted only twelve , that they would be used only at Hyper Base , that they would be destroyed once the Drive were perfected , and that full precautions would be taken . And they insisted on secrecy  --  and that 's the situation . " Dr. Calvin spoke through her teeth , " I would have re-signed . " " It would n't have helped . The government was offering the company a fortune , and threatening it with antirobot legislation in case of a refusal . We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this leaks out , it might hurt Kallner and the government , but it would hurt U. S. Robotsa devil of a lot more . " The psychologist stared at him . " Peter , do n't you realizewhat all this is about ? Ca n't you understand what the removal of the First Law means ? It is n't just a matter of secrecy . " " I know what removal would mean . I 'm not a child . It would mean complete instability , with no nonimaginary solutions to the positronic Field Equations . " " Yes , mathematically . But can you translate that into crude psychological thought . All normal life , Peter , consciouslyor otherwise , resents domination . If the dominationis by an inferior , or by a supposed inferior , the resentment becomes stronger . Physically , and , to an extent , mentally , a robot  --  any robot  --  is superior to human beings . What makes him slavish , then ? Only the First Law ! Why , without it , the first order you tried to give a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think ? " " Susan , " said Bogert , with an air of sympathetic amusement . " I 'll admit that this Frankenstein Complex you 're exhibiting has a certain justification  --  hence the First Law in the first place . But the Law , I repeat and repeat , has not been removed  --  merely modified . " " And what about the stability of the brain ? " The mathematician thrust out his lips , " Decreased , naturally . But it 's within the border of safety . The first Nestors were delivered to Hyper Base nine months ago , and nothing whatever has gone wrong till now , and even this involves merely fear of discovery and not danger to hu-mans . " " Very well , then . We 'll see what comes of the morning conference . " Bogert saw her politely to the door and grimaced eloquentlywhen she left . He saw no reason to change his perennial opinion of her as a sour and fidgety frustration . Susan Calvin 's train of thought did not include Bogert in the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pretentious sleekness . Gerald Black had taken his degree in etheric physics the year before and , in common with his entire generation of physicists , found himself engaged in the problem of the Drive . He now made a proper addition to the general atmosphereof these meetings on Hyper Base . In his stained white smock , he was half rebellious and wholly uncertain . His stocky strength seemed striving for release and his fingers , as they twisted each other with nervous yanks , might have forced an iron bar out of true . Major-general Kallner sat beside him , the two from U. S. Robots faced him . Black said , " I 'm told that I was the last to see Nester io before he vanished . I take it you want to ask me about that . " Dr. Calvin regarded him with interest , " You sound as if you were not sure , young man . Do n't you know whether you were the last to see him ? " " He worked with me , ma'am , on the field generators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't know if anyone saw him after about noon . No one admits having done so . " " Do you think anyone 's lying about it ? " 142 I , ROBOT " I do n't say that . But I do n't say that I want the blame of it , either . " His dark eyes smoldered . " There 's no question of blame . The robot acted as it did because of what it is . We 're just trying to locate it , Mr. Black , and let 's put everything else aside . Now if you 've worked with the robot , you probably know it better than anyone else . Was there anything unusual about it that you noticed ? Had you ever worked with robots before ? " " I 've worked with other robots we have here  --  the simple ones . Nothing different about the Nestors except that they 're a good deal cleverer  --  and more annoying . " " Annoying ? In what way ? " " Well  --  perhaps it 's not their fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a little jagged . Fooling around with hyper-space is n't fun . " IIc smiled feebly , finding pleasure in confession . " We run the risk continually of blowing a hole in normal space-time fabric and dropping right out of the universe , asteroid and all . Sounds screwy , does n't it ? Naturally , you 're on edge sometimes . But these Nestors are n't . They 're curious , they 're calm , they do n't worry . It 's enough to drive you nuts at times . When you want something done in a tearing hurry , they seem to take their time . Sometimes I 'd rather do without . " " You say they take their time ? Have they ever refused an order ? " " Oh , no , "  --  hastily . " They do it all right . They tell you when they think you 're wrong , though . They do n't know anything about the subject but what we taught them , but that does n't stop them . Maybe I imagine it , but the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Kallner cleared his throat ominously , " Why have no complaints reached me on the matter , Black ? " The young physicist reddened , " We did n't really want to do without the robots , sir , and besides we were n't certain exactly how such . . . uh . . . minor complaints might be received . " LITTLE LOST ROBOT 143Bogert interrupted softly , " Anything in particular happen the morning you last saw it ? " There was a silence . With a quiet motion , Calvin repressedthe comment that was about to emerge from Kallner , and waited patiently . Then Black spoke in blurting anger , " I had a little trouble with it . I 'd broken a Kimball tube that morning and was out five days of work ; my entire program was behind schedule ; I had n't received any mail from home for a couple of weeks . And he came around wanting me to repeat an experimentI had abandoned a month ago . He was always annoying me on that subject and I was tired of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all I saw of him . " " You told him to go away ? " asked Dr. Calvin with sharp interest . " In just those words ? Did you say Go away ' ? Try to remember the exact words . " There was apparently an internal struggle in progress . Black cradled his forehead in a broad palm for a moment , then tore it away and said defiantly , " I said , ' Go lose yourself . ' " Bogert laughed for a short moment . " And he did , eh ? " But Calvin was n't finished . She spoke cajolingly , " Now we 're getting somewhere , Mr. Black . But exact details are important . In understanding the robot 's actions , a word , a gesture , an emphasis may be everything . You could n't have said just those three words , for instance , could you ? By your own description you must have been in a hasty mood . Perhaps you strengthened your speech a little . " The young man reddened , " Well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . a few things . " " Exactly what things ? " " Oh  --  I would n't remember exactly . Besides I could n't repeat it . You know how you get when you 're excited . His embarrassed laugh was almost a giggle , " I sort of have a tendency to strong language . " " That 's quite all right , " she replied , with prim severity. 144 I , ROBOT " At the moment , I 'm a psychologist . I would like to have you repeat exactly what you said as nearly as you remember , and , even more important , the exact tone of voice you used . " Black looked at his commanding officer for support , found none . His eyes grew round and appalled , " But I ca n't . " " You must . " " Suppose , " said Bogert , with ill-hidden amusement , " you address me . You may find it easier . " The young man 's scarlet face turned to Bogert . He swallowed . " I said  --  " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said  --  " And he drew a deep breath and spewed it out hastily in one long succession of syllables . Then , in the charged air that lingered , he concluded almost in tears , " . . . more or less . I do n't remember the exact order of what I called him , and maybe I left out something or put in something , but that was about it . " Only the slightest flush betrayed any feeling on the part of the robopsychologist . She said , " I am aware of the meaning of most of the terms used . The others , I suppose , are equally derogatory . " " I 'm afraid so , " agreed the tormented Black . " And in among it , you told him to lose himself . " " I meant it only figuratively . " " I realize that . No disciplinary action is intended , I am sure . " And at her glance , the general , who , five seconds earlier , had seemed not sure at all , nodded angrily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your co-operation . " It took five hours for Susan Calvin to interview the sixtythreerobots . It was five hours of multi-repetition ; of replacement after replacement of identical robot ; of Questions A , B , C , D ; and Answers A , B , C , D ; of a carefullybland expression , a carefully neutral tone , a carefully friendly atmosphere ; and a hidden wire recorder . The psychologist felt drained of vitality when she was finished . Bogert was waiting for her and looked expectant as she dropped the recording spool with a clang upon the plastic of the desk . She shook her head , " All sixty-three seemed the same to me . I could n't tell  --  " He said , " You could n't expect to tell by ear , Susan . Suppose we analyze the recordings . " Ordinarily , the mathematical interpretation of verbal reactions of robots is one of the more intricate branches of robotic analysis . It requires a staff of trained technicians and the help of complicated computing machines . Bogert knew that . Bogert stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened to each set of replies , made lists of word deviations , and graphs of the intervals of responses . " There are no anomalies present , Susan . The variations in wording and the time reactions are within the limits of ordinary frequency groupings . We need finer methods . They must have computers here . No . " He frowned and nibbled delicately at a thumbnail . " We ca n't use computers . Too much danger of leakage . Or maybe if we  --  " Dr. Calvin stopped him with an impatient gesture , " Please , Peter . This is n't one of your petty laboratory problems . If we ca n't determine the modified Nestor by some gross difference that we can see with the naked eye , one that there is no mistake about , we 're out of luck . The danger of being wrong , and of letting him escape is otherwise too great . It 's not enough to point out a minute irregularity in a graph . I tell you , if that 's all I 've got to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have you spoken to the other modified Nestors ? " " Yes , I have , " snapped back Bogert , " and there 's nothing146 I , ROBOTwrong with them . They 're above normal in friendliness if anything . They answered my questions , displayed pride in their knowledge  --  except the two new ones that have n't had time to learn their etheric physics . They laughed rather good-naturedly at my ignorance in some of the specializationshere . " He shrugged , " I suppose that forms some of the basis for resentment toward them on the part of the technicians here . The robots are perhaps too willing to impress you with their greater knowledge . " " Can you try a few Planar Reactions to see if there has been any change , any deterioration , in their mental set-up since manufacture . " " I have n't yet , but I will . " He shook a slim finger at her , " You 're losing your nerve , Susan . I do n't see what it is you 're dramatizing . They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took fire . " They are ? Do you realizeone of them is lying . One of the sixty-three robots I have just interviewed has deliberately lied to me after the strictest injunction to tell the truth . The abnormality indicatedis horribly deep-seated , and horribly frightening . " Peter Bogert felt his teeth harden against each other . He said , " Not at all . Look ! Nestor io was given orders to lose himself . Those orders were expressed in maximum urgency by the person most authorized to command him . : You ca n't counteract that order either by superior urgency or superior right of command . Naturally , the robot will attempt to defend the carrying out of his orders . In fact , objectively , I admire his ingenuity . How better can a robot lose himself than to hide himself among a group of similar robots ? " " Yes , you would admire it . I 've detected amusement in you , Peter  --  amusement and an appalling lack of understanding . Are you a roboticist , Peter ? Those robots attach importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much yourself . Subconsciously they feel humans to be inferior and the First Law which protects us from them is imperfect . They are unstable . And here we have a youngLITTLE LOST ROBOT 147man ordering a robot to leave him , to lose himself , with every verbal appearance of revulsion , disdain , and disgust . Granted , that robot must follow orders , but subconsciously , there is resentment . It will become more important than ever for it to prove that it is superior despite the horrible names it was called . It may become so important that what 's left of the First Law wo n't be enough . " " How on Earth , or anywhere in the Solar System , Susan , is a robot going to know the meaning of the assorted strong language used upon him ? Obscenity is not one of the things impressioned upon his brain . " " Original impressionment is not everything , " Calvin snarled at him . " Robots have learning capacity , you .. . you fool  --  " And Bogert knew that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't you suppose he could tell from the tone used that the words were n't complimentary ? Do n't you suppose he 's heard the words used before and noted upon what occasions . " " Well , then , " shouted Bogert , " will you kindly tell me one way in which a modified robot can harm a human being , no matter how offended it is , no matter how sick with desire to prove superiority . " " If I tell you one way , will you keep quiet ? " " Yes . " They were leaning across the table at each other , angry eyes nailed together . The psychologist said , " If a modified robot were to drop a heavy weight upon a human being , he would not be breaking the First Law , if he did so with the knowledge that his strength and reaction speed would be sufficient to snatch the weight away before it struck the man . However once the weight left his fingers , he would be no longer the active medium . Only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could then change his mind and merely by inaction , allow the weight to strike . The modified First Law allows that . " " That 's an awful stretch of imagination . " 148 I , ROBOT " That 's what my profession requires sometimes . Peter , let 's not quarrel . Let 's work . You know the exact nature of the stimulus that caused the robot to lose himself . You have the records of his original mental make-up . I want you to tell me how possible it is for our robot to do the sort of thing I just talked about . Not the specific instance , mind you , but that whole class of response . And I want it done quickly . " " And meanwhile  --  " " And meanwhile , we 'll have to try performance tests directly on the response to First Law . " Gerald Black , at his own request , was supervising the mushrooming wooden partitions that were springing up in a bellying circle on the vaulted third floor of Radiation Building 2 . The laborers worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one was openly a-wonder at the sixty-three photocells that required installation . One of them sat down near Black , removed his hat , and wiped his forehead thoughtfully with a freckled forearm . Black nodded at him , " How 's it doing , Walensky ? " Walensky shrugged and fired a cigar , " Smooth as butter . What 's going on anyway , Doc ? First , there 's no work for three days and then we have this mess of jiggers . " He leaned backward on his elbows and puffed smoke . Black twitched his eyebrows , " A couple of robot men came over from Earth . Remember the trouble we had with robots running into the gamma fields , before we pounded it into their skulls that they were n't to do it . " " Yeah . Did n't we get new robots ? " " We got some replacements , but mostly it was a job of indoctrination . Anyway , the people who make them want to figure out robots that are n't hit so bad by gamma rays . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work on the Drive for this robot deal . I thought nothing was allowed to stop the Drive . " " Well , it 's the fellows upstairs that have the say on that . Me  --  I just do as I 'm told . Probably all a matter of pull  --  " " Yeah , " the electrician jerked a smile , and winked a wise eye . " Somebody knew somebody in Washington . But as long as my pay comes through on the dot , I should worry . The Drive 's none of my affair . What are they going to do here ? " " You 're asking me ? They brought a mess of robots with them ,  --  over sixty , and they 're going to measure reactions . That 's all my knowledge . " " How long will it take ? " " I wish I knew . " " Well , " Walensky said , with heavy sarcasm , " as long as they dish me my money , they can play games all they want . " Black felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmless , and near enough to the truth to take the fangs out of curiosity . A man sat in the chair , motionless , silent . A weight dropped , crashed downward , then pounded aside at the last moment under the synchronized thump or a sudden force beam . In sixty-three wooden cells , watching NST-z robots dashed forward in that split second before the weight veered , and sixty-three photocells five feet ahead of their original positions jiggled the marking pen and presented a little jag on the paper . The weight rose and dropped , rose and dropped , roseTen times ! Ten times the robots sprang forward and stopped , as the man remained safely seated . Major-general Kallner had not worn his uniform in its entirety since the first dinner with the U. S. Robot representatives . He wore nothing over his blue-gray shirt now , the collar was open , and the black tie was pulled loose . He looked hopefully at Bogert , who was still blandly neat and whose inner tension was perhaps betrayed only by the trace of glister at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How does it look ? What is it you 're trying to see ? " Bogert replied , " A difference which may turn out to be a little too subtle for our purposes , I 'm afraid . For sixty- two of those robots the necessity of jumping toward the apparently threatened human was what we call , in robotics , a forced reaction . You see , even when the robots knew that the human in question would not come to harm  --  and after the third or fourth time they must have known it  --  they could not prevent reacting as they did . First Law requires it . " " Well ? " " But the sixty-third robot , the modified Nestor , had no such compulsion . He was under free action . If he had wished , he could have remained in his seat . Unfortu- nately , " and his voice was mildly regretful , " he did n't so wish . " " Why do you suppose ? " Bogert shrugged , " I suppose Dr. Calvin will tell us when she gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . She is sometimes a bit annoying . " " She 's qualified , is n't she ? " demanded the general with a sudden frown of uneasiness . " Yes . " Bogert seemed amused . " She 's qualified all right . " She understands robots like a sister  --  comes from hating human beings so much , I think . It 's just that , psychologist or not , she 's an extreme neurotic . Has para- noid tendencies . Do n't take her too seriously . " He spread the long row of broken-line graphs out in front of him . " You see , general , in the case of each robot the time interval from moment of drop to the completion of a five-foot movement tends to decrease as the tests are repeated . There 's a definite mathematical relationship that governs such things and failure to conform would indicate marked abnormality in the positronic brain . Un- fortunately , all here appear normal . " " But if our Nestor ro was not responding with a forced action , why is n't his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's simple enough . Robotic responses are not perfectlyanalogous to human responses , more 's the pity . In human beings , voluntary action is much slower than reflexaction . But that 's not the case with robots ; with them it is merely a question of freedom of choice , otherwisethe speeds of free and forced action are much the same . What I had been expecting , though , was that Nestorio would be caught by surprise the first time and allow too great an interval to elapse before responding . " " And he did n't ? " " I 'm afraid not . " " Then we have n't gotten anywhere . " The general sat back with an expression of pain . " It 's five days since you 've come . " At this point , Susan Calvin entered and slammed the door behind her . " Put your graphs away , Peter , " she cried , " you know they do n't show anything . " She mumbled something impatiently as Kallner halfroseto greet her , and went on , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like what 's happening . " Bogert exchanged a resigned glance with the general . " Is anything wrong ? " " You mean specifically ? No . But I do n't like to have Nestor ro continue to elude us . It 's bad . It must be gratifyinghis swollen sense of superiority . I 'm afraid that his motivation is no longer simply one of following orders . I think it 's becoming more a matter of sheer neurotic necessity to out-think humans . That 's a dangerously unhealthy situation . Peter , have you done what I asked ? Have you worked out the instability factors of the modified NS-2 along the lines I want ? " " It 's in progress , " said the mathematician , without interest . She stared at him angrily for a moment , then turned to Kallner . " Nestor ro is decidedly aware of what we 're do-152 I , ROBOTing , general . He had no reason to jump for the bait in this experiment , especially after the first time , when he must have seen that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't help it ; but he was deliberately falsifyinga reaction . " " What do you think we ought to do now , then , Dr. Calvin ? " " Make it impossible for him to fake an action the next time . We will repeat the experiment , but with an addition . High-tension cables , capable of electrocuting the Nestor models will be placed between subject and robotenoughof them to avoid the possibility of jumping over  --  and the robot will be made perfectly aware in advance that touching the cables will mean death . " " Hold on , " spat out Bogert with sudden viciousness . " I rule that out . We are not electrocuting two million dollars worth of robots to locate Nestor io . There are other ways . " " You 're certain ? You 've found none . In any case , it 's not a question of electrocution . We can arrange a relay which will break the current at the instant of application of weight . If the robot should place his weight on it , he wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . " The general 's eyes gleamed into hope . " Will that work ? " " It should . Under those conditions , Nestor io would have to remain in his scat . He could be ordered to touch the cables and die , for the Second Law of obedience is superior to the Third Law of self-preservation . But he wo n't be ordered to ; he will merely be left to his own devices , as will all the robots . In the case of the normal robots , the First Law of human safety will drive them to their death even without orders . But not our Nestor io . Without the entire First Law , and without having receivedany orders on the matter , the Third Law , self-preservation , will be the highest operating , and he will haveno choice but to remain in his seat . It would be a forced action . " " Will it be done tonight , then ? " " Tonight , " said the psychologist , " if the cables can be laid in time . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up against . " A man sat in the chair , motionless , silent . A weight dropped , crashed downward , then pounded aside at the last moment under the synchronized thump of a sudden force beam . Only onceAnd from her small camp chair in the observing booth in the balcony , Dr. Susan Calvin rose with a short gasp of pure horror . Sixty-three robots sat quietly in their chairs , staring owlishly at the endangered man before them . Not one moved . Dr. Calvin was angry , angry almost past endurance . Angry the worse for not daring to show it to the robots that , one by one , were entering the room and then leaving . She checked the list . Number Twenty-eight was due in now  --  Thirty-five still lay ahead of her . Number Twenty-eight entered , diffidently . She forced herself into reasonable calm . " And who are you ? " The robot replied in a low , uncertain voice , " I have received no number of my own yet , ma'am . I 'm an NS-2 robot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a slip of paper here that I 'm to give to you . " " You have n't been in here before this today ? " " No , ma'am . " " Sit down . Right there . I want to ask you some questions , Number Twenty-eight . Were you in the Radiation Room of Building Two about four hours ago ? " 154 I , ROBOT The robot had trouble answering . Then it came out hoarsely , like machinery needing oil , " Yes , ma'am . " " There was a man who almost came to harm there , was n't there ? " " Yes , ma'am . " " You did nothing , did you ? " " No , ma'am . " " The man might have been hurt because of your inac- tion . Do you know that ? " " Yes , ma'am . I could n't help it , ma'am . " It is hard to picture a large expressionless metallic figure cringing , but it managed . " I want you to tell me exactly why you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain , ma'am . I certainly do n't want to have you . . . have anyone . . . think that I could do a thing that might cause harm to a master . Oh , no , that would be a horrible ... an inconceivable  --  " " Please do n't get excited , boy . I 'm not blaming you for anything . I only want to know what you were thinking at the time . " " Ma'am , before it all happened you told us that one of the masters would be in danger of harm from that weight that keeps falling and that we would have to cross electric cables if we were to try to save him . Well , ma'am , that would n't stop me . What is my destruction compared to the safety of a master ? But . . . but it occurred to me that if I died on my way to him , I would n't be able to save him anyway . The weight would crush him and then I would be dead for no purpose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't have , if I had only stayed alive . Do you understand me , ma'am ? " " You mean that it was merely a choice of the man dy- ing , or both the man and yourself dying . Is that right ? " " Yes , ma'am . It was impossible to save the master . He might be considered dead . In that case , it is inconceivable that I destroy myself for nothing  --  without orders . " The robopsychologist twiddled a pencil . She had heard the same story with insignificant verbal variations twentyseventimes before . This was the crucial question now . " Boy , " she said , " your thinking has its points , but it is not the sort of thing I thought you might think . Did you think of this yourself ? " The robot hesitated . " No . " " Who thought of it , then ? " " Ve were talking last night , and one of us got that idea and it sounded reasonable . " " Which one ? " The robot thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . " She sighed , " That 's all . " Number Twenty-nine was next . Thirty-four after that . Major-general Kallner , too , was angry . For one week all of Hyper Base had stopped dead , barring some paper work on the subsidiary asteroids of the group . For nearly one week , the two top experts in the field had aggravated the situation with useless tests . And now they  --  or the woman , at any rate  --  made impossible propositions . Fortunately for the general situation , Kallner felt it impolitic to display his anger openly . Susan Calvin was insisting , " Why not , sir ? It 's obvious that the present situation is unfortunate . The only way we may reach results in the future  --  or what future is left us in this matter  --  is to separate the robots . We ca n't keep them together any longer . " " My dear Dr. Calvin , " rumbled the general , his voice sinking into the lower baritone registers . " I do n't see how I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calvin raised her arms helplessly . " I can do nothingthen . Nestor r.o will either imitate what the other robots would do , or else argue them plausibly into not doing what he himself can not do . And in any case , this is bad business . We 're in actual combat with this little156 I , ROBOT lost robot of ours and he 's winning out . Every victory of his aggravates his abnormality . " She rose to her feet in determination . " General Kallner , if you do not separate the robots as I ask , then I can only demand that all sixty-three be destroyed immediately . " " You demand it , do you ? " Bogert looked up suddenly , and with real anger . " What gives you the right to demand any such thing . Those robots remain as they are . I 'm responsible to the management , not you . " " And I , " added Major-general Kallner , " am responsible to the World Co-ordinator  --  and I must have this settled . " " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing for me to do but resign . If necessary to force you to the necessary destruction , I 'll make this whole matter public . It was not I that approved the manufacture of modified robots . " " One word from you , Dr. Calvin , " said the general , deliberately , " in violation of security measures , and you would be certainly imprisoned instantly . " Bogert felt the matter to be getting out of hand . His voice grew syrupy , " Well , now , we 're beginning to act like children , all of us . We need only a little more time . Surely we can outwit a robot without resigning , or imprisoning people , or destroying two millions . " The psychologist turned on him with quiet fury , " I do n't want any unbalanced robots in existence . We have one Nestor that 's definitely unbalanced , eleven more that are potentially so , and sixty-two normal robots that are being subjected to an unbalanced environment . The only absolute safe method is complete destruction . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the an- gry tumult of growingly unrestrained emotion froze . " Come in , " growled Kallner . It was Gerald Black , looking perturbed . He had heard angry voices . He said , " I thought I 'd come myself ... did n't like to ask anyone else  --  " " What is it ? Do n't orate  --  " " The locks on Compartment C in the trading ship havebeen played with . There are fresh scratches on them . " " Compartment C ? " exclaimed Calvin quickly . " That'sthe one that holds the robots , is n't it ? Who did it ? " " From the inside , " said Black , laconically . " The lock is n't out of order , is it ? " " No . It 's all right . I 've been staying the ship now for four days and none of them have tried to get out . But I thought you ought to know , and I did n't like to spread the news . I noticed the matter myself . " " Is anyone there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robbins and McAdams there . " There was a thoughtful silence , and then Dr. Calvin said , ironically , " Well ? " Kallner rubbed his nose uncertainly , " What 's it all about ? " " Is n't it obvious ? Nestor io is planning to leave . That order to lose himself is dominating his abnormality past anything we can do . I would n't be surprised if what 's left of his First Law would scarcely be powerful enough to override it . He is perfectly capable of seizing the ship and leaving with it . Then we 'd have a mad robot on a spaceship . What would he do next ? Any idea ? Do you still want to leave them all together , general ? " " Nonsense , " interrupted Bogert . He had regained his smoothness . " All that from a few scratch marks on a lock . " " Have you , Dr. Bogert , completed the analysis I 've required , since you volunteer opinions ? " " Yes . " " May I see it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't I ask that , either ? " " Because there 's no point in it , Susan . I told you in advance that these modified robots are less stable than the normal variety , and my analysis shows it . There 's a certain very small chance of breakdown under extreme circum-158 I , ROBOTstances that are not likely to occur . Let it go at that . I wo n't give you ammunition for your absurd claim that sixty-two perfectly good robots be destroyed just because so far you lack the ability to detect Nestor io among them . " Susan Calvin stared him down and let disgust fill her eyes . " You wo n't let anything stand in the way of the permanent directorship , will you ? " " Please , " begged Kallner , half in irritation . " Do you insist that nothing further can be done , Dr. Calvin ? " " I ca n't think of anything , sir , " she replied , wearily . " If there were only other differences between Nestor io and the normal robots , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one other difference . Something in impressionment , environment , specification  --  " And she stopped suddenly . " What is it ? " " I 've thought of something . . . I think  --  " Her eyes grew distant and hard , " These modified Nestors , Peter . They get the same impressioning the normal ones get , 0i do n't they ? " " Yes , Exactly the same . " " And what was it you were saying , Mr. Black , " she turned to the young man , who through the storms that had followed his news had maintained a discreet silence . " Once when complaining of the Nestors ' attitude of superiority , you said the technicians had taught them all they knew . " " Yes , in etheric physics . They 're not acquainted with $ the subject when they come here . " " That 's right , " said Bogert , in surprise . " I told you , Susan , when I spoke to the other Nestors here that the two new arrivals had n't learned etheric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Calvin was speaking in mountingexcitement . " Why are n't NS-2 models impressioned with etheric physics to start with ? " " I can tell you that , " said Kallner . " It 's all of a pieceLITTLE LOST ROBOT 159with the secrecy . We thought that if we made a special model with knowledge of etheric physics , used twelve of them , and put the others to work in an unrelated field , there might be suspicion . Men working with normal Nestorsmight wonder why they knew etheric physics . So there was merely an impressionment with a capacity for training in the field . Only the ones that come here , naturally , receive such a training . It 's that simple . " " I understand . Please get out of here , the lot of you . Let me have an hour or so . " Calvin felt she could not face the ordeal for a third time . Her mind had contemplated it and rejected it with an intensity that left her nauseated . She could face that unending file of repetitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while she sat aside , eyes and mind half-closed . Number Fourteen came in  --  forty-nine to go . Bogert looked up from the quide sheet and said , " What is your number in line ? " " Fourteen , sir . " The robot presented his numbered ticket . " Sit down , boy . " Bogert asked , " You have n't been here before on this day ? " " No , sir . " " Well , boy , we are going to have another man in danger of harm soon after we 're through here . In fact , when you leave this room , you will be led to a stall where you will wait quietly , till you are needed . Do you under-stand ? " " Yes , sir . " " Now , naturally , if a man is in danger of harm , you will try to save him . " " Naturally , sir . " " Unfortunately , between the man and yourself , there will be a gamma ray field . " 160 I , ROBOT Silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Bogert sharply . " Energy radiation , sir ? " The next question came in a friendly , offhand manner , " Ever work with gamma rays ? " " No , sir . " The answer was definite . " Hm-m . Well , boy , gamma rays will kill you instantly . They 'll destroy your brain . That is a fact you must know and remember . Naturally , you do n't want to destroy your- self . " " Naturally . " Again the robot seemed shocked . Then , slowly , " But , sir , if the gamma rays are between myself and the master that may be harmed , how can I save him ? I would be destroying myself to no purpose . " " Yes , there is that . " Bogert seemed concerned about the matter . " The only thing I can advise , boy , is that if you detect the gamma radiation between yourself and the man , you may as well sit where you are . " The robot was openly relieved . " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would there ? " " Of course not . But if there were n't any dangerous ra- diation , that would be a different matter . " " Naturally , sir . No question of that . " " You may leave now . The man on the other side of the door will lead you to your stall . Please wait there . " He turned to Susan Calvin when the robot left . " How did that go , Susan ? " " Very well , " she said , dully . " Do you think we could catch Nestor 10 by quick ques- tioning on etheric physics ? " " Perhaps , but it 's not sure enough . " Her hands lay loosely in her lap . " Remember , he 's fighting us . He 's on his guard . The only way we can catch him is to outsmart him  --  and , within his limitations , he can think much more quickly than a human being . " " Well , just for fun  --  suppose I ask the robots from now on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance . " " No ! " Dr. Calvin 's eyes sparked to life . " It would be too easy for him to deny knowledge and then he 'd be warned against the test that 's coming up  --  which is our real chance . Please follow the questions I 've indicated , Peter , and do n't improvise . It 's just within the bounds of risk to ask them if they 've ever worked with gamma rays . And try to sound even less interested than you do when you ask it . " Bogert shrugged , and pressed the buzzer that would allow the entrance of Number Fifteen . The large Radiation Room was in readiness once more . The robots waited patiently in their wooden cells , all open to the center but closed off from each other . Major-general Kallner mopped his brow slowly with a large handkerchief while Dr. Calvin checked the last detailswith Black . " You 're sure now , " she demanded , " that none of the robots have had a chance to talk with each other after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " insisted Black . " There 's not been a word exchanged . " " And the robots are put in the proper stalls ? " " Here 's the plan . " The psychologist looked at it thoughtfully , " Um-m-m . " The general peered over her shoulder . " What 's the idea of the arrangement , Dr. Calvin ? " " I 've asked to have those robots that appeared even slightly out of true in the previous tests concentrated on one side of the circle . I 'm going to be sitting in the center myself this time , and I wanted to watch those particu-larly . " " You 're going to be sitting there  --  " exclaimed Bogert . " Why not ? " she demanded coldly . " What I expect tosee may be something quite momentary . I ca n't risk havinganyone else as main observer . Peter , you 'll be in the162 I , ROBOTobserving booth , and I want you to keep your eye on the opposite side of the circle . General Kallner , I 've arranged for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case visualobservation is n't enough . If these are required , the robots are to remain exactly where they are until the picturesare developed and studied . None must leave , none must change place . Is that clear ? " " Perfectly . " " Then let 's try it this one last time . " Susan Calvin sat in the chair , silent , eyes restless . A weight dropped , crashed downward , then pounded aside at the last moment under the synchronized thump of a sudden force beam . And a single robot jerked upright and took two steps . And stopped . But Dr. Calvin was upright , and her finger pointed to him sharply . " Nestor 1o , come here , " she cried , " come here ! COME HERE ! " Slowly , reluctantly , the robot took another step forward . The psychologist shouted at the top of her voice , without taking her eyes from the robot , " Get every other robot out of this place , somebody . Get them out quickly , and keep them out . Somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thud of hard feet upon the floor . She did not look away . Nestor io  --  if it was Nestor io  --  took another step , and then , under force of her imperious gesture , two more . He was only ten feet away , when he spoke harshly , " I have been told to be lost  --  " Another stop . " I must not disobey . They have not found me so far  --  He would think me a failure  --  He told me  --  But it 's not so  --  I am powerful and intelligent  --  " The words came in spurts . Another step . " I know a good deal  --  He would think . . I mean I 've been found  --  Disgraceful  --  Not I-I am intelligent  --  And by just a master . . . who is weak  --  Slow  --  " Another step  --  and one metal arm flew out suddenly to her shoulder , and she felt the weight bearing her down . Her throat constricted , and she felt a shriek tear through . Dimly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one must find me . No master  --  " and the cold metal was against her , and she was sinking under the weight of it . And then a queer , metallic sound , and she was on the ground with an unfelt thump , and a gleaming arm was heavy across her body . It did not move . Nor did Nestor io , who sprawled beside her . And now faces were bending over her . Gerald Black was gasping , " Are you hurt , Dr. Calvin ? " She shook her head feebly . They pried the arm off her and lifted her gently to her feet , " What happened ? " Black said , " I bathed the place in gamma rays for five seconds . We did n't know what was happening . It was n't till the last second that we realized he was attacking you , and then there was no time for anything but a gamma field . He went down in an instant . There was n't enough to harm you though . Do n't worry about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes and leaned for a moment upon his shoulder . " I do n't think I was attackedexactly . Nestor io was simply trying to do so . What was left of the First Law was still holding him back . " Susan Calvin and Peter Bogert , two weeks after their first meeting with Major-general Kallner had their last . Work at Hyper Base had been resumed . The trading ship with its sixty-two normal NS-z 's was gone to wherever it was bound , with an officially imposed story to explain its two weeks ' delay . The government cruiser was making ready to carry the two roboticists back to Earth . Kallner was once again a-gleam in dress uniform . His white gloves shone as he shook hands . Calvin said , " The other modified Nestors are , of course , to be destroyed . " " They will be . We 'll make shift with normal robots , or , if necessary , do without . " " Good . " " But tell me  --  You have n't explained  --  How was it done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would have told you in advance if I had been more certain of its working . You see , Nestor io had a superiority complex that was becoming more radical all the time . He liked to think that he and other robots knew more than human beings . It was becoming very important for him to think so . " We knew that . So we warned every robot in advance that gamma rays would kill them , which it would , and we further warned them all that gamma rays would be between them and myself . So they all stayed where they were , naturally . By Nestor io 's own logic in the previous test they had all decided that there was no point in trying to save a human being if they were sure to die before they could do it . " " Well , yes , Dr. Calvin , I understand that . But why did Nestor io himself leave his seat . " " Ah ! That was a little arrangement between myself and your young Mr. Black . You see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the robots  --  but infrared rays . Just ordinary heat rays , absolutely harmless . Nestor io knew they were infrared and harmless and so he began to dash out , as he expected the rest would do , under First Law compulsion . It was only a fraction of a second too late that he remembered that the normal NS-2 's could detect radiation , but could not identify the type . That he himself could only identify wave lengths by virtue of the training he had received at Hyper Base , undermere human beings , was a little too humiliating toremember for just a moment . To the normal robots the area was fatal because we had told them it would be , and only Nestor 10 knew we were lying . " And just for a moment he forgot , or did n't want to remember , that other robots might be more ignorant than human beings . His very superiority caught him . Goodbye , general . " SEVENESCAPE ! WHEN SUSAN CALVIN returned from Hyper Base , Alfred Lanning was waiting for her . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it to be over seventy-five . Yet his mind was keen , and if he had finally allowed himself to be made Director-Emeritus of Research with Bogert as acting Director , it did not prevent him from appearing in his office daily . " How close are they to the Hyper-atomic Drive , " he asked . " I do n't know , " she replied irritably , " I did n't ask . " " Hmm . I wish they 'd hurry . Because if they do n't , Consolidated might beat them to it . And beat us to it as well . " " Consolidated . What have they got to do with it ? " " Well , we 're not the only ones with calculating machines . Ours may be positronic , but that does n't mean they 're better . Robertson is calling a big meeting about it tomorrow . He 's been waiting for you to come back . " Robertson of U. S. Robot and Mechanical Men Corporation , son of the founder , pointed his lean nose at his general manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You start now . Let 's get this straight . " 167The general manager did so with alacrity , " Here 's the deal now , chief . Consolidated Robots approached us a month ago with a funny sort of proposition . They brought about five tons of figures , equations , all that sort of stuff . It was a problem , see , and they wanted an answerfrom The Brain . The terms were as follows  --  " He ticked them off on thick fingers : " A hundred thousandfor us if there is no solution and we can tell them the missing factors . Two hundred thousand if there is a solution , plus costs of construction of the machine involved , plus quarter interest in all profits derived therefrom . The problem concerns the development of an interstellar engine  --  " Robertson frowned and his lean figure stiffened , " Despitethe fact that they have a thinking machine of their own . Right ? " " Exactly what makes the whole proposition a foul ball , chief . Levver , take it from there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference table and smoothed his stubbled chin with a faint rasping sound . He smiled : " It 's this way , sir . Consolidated had a thinking machine . It 's broken . " " What ? " Robertson half rose . " That 's right . Broken ! It 's kaput . Nobody knows why , but I got hold of some pretty interesting guesses  --  like , for instance , that they asked it to give them an interstellar engine with the same set of information they came to us with , and that it cracked their machine wide open . It 's scrap  --  just scrap now . " " You get it , chief ? " The general manager was wildly jubilant . " You get it ? There is n't any industrial research group of any size that is n't trying to develop a space-warp engine , and Consolidated and U. S. Robots have the lead on the field with our super robot-brains . Now that they 've managed to foul theirs up , we have a clear field . That 's the nub , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will take themsix years at least to build another and they 're sunk , unless they can break ours , too , with the same problem . " The president of U. S. Robots bulged his eyes , " Why , the dirty rats  --  " " Hold on , chief . There 's more to this . " He pointed a finger with a wide sweep , " Lanning , take it ! " Dr. Alfred Lanning viewed the proceedings with faint scorn  --  his usual reaction to the doings of the vastly better-paidbusiness and sales divisions . His unbelievable gray eyebrows hunched low and his voice was dry : " From a scientific standpoint the situation , while not entirely clear , is subject to intelligent analysis . The question of interstellar travel under present conditions of physicaltheory is . . . uh . . . vague . The matter is wide open  --  and the information given by Consolidated to its thinking machine , assuming these we have to be the same , was similarly wide open . Our mathematical department has given it a thorough analysis , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contains all known developments of Franciacci 's spacewarptheory , and , apparently , all pertinent astrophysical and electronic data . It 's quite a mouthful . " Robertson followed anxiously . He interrupted , " Too much for The Brain to handle ? " Lanning shook his head decisively , " No . There are no known limits to The Brain 's capacity . It 's a different matter . It 's a question of the Robotic Laws . The Brain , for instance , could never supply a solution to a problem set to it if that solution would involve the death or injury of humans . As far as it would be concerned , a problem with only such a solution would be insoluble . If such a problemis combined with an extremely urgent demand that it be answered , it is just possible that The Brain , only a robot after all , would be presented with a dilemma , where it could neither answer nor refuse to answer . Something of the sort must have happened to Consolidated 's ma-chine. " 170 I , ROBOT ESCAPE ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go ahead , Dr. Lanning . Explain it the way you explained it to me . " Lanning set his lips and raised his eyebrows in the direction of Dr. Susan Calvin who lifted her eyes from her preciselyfolded hands for the first time . Her voice was low and colorless . " The nature of a robot reaction to a dilemma is startling , " she began . " Robot psychology is far from perfect  --  as a specialist , I can assure you of that  --  but it can be discussed in qualitative terms , because with all the complicationsintroduced into a robot 's positronic brain , it is built by humans and is therefore built according to human values . " Now a human caught in an impossibility often respondsby a retreat from reality : by entry into a world of delusion , or by taking to drink , going off into hysteria , or jumping off a bridge . It all comes to the same thing  --  a refusal or inability to face the situation squarely . And so , the robot . A dilemma at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst it will burn out every positronic brain path past repair . " " I see , " said Robertson , who did n't . " Now what about this information Consolidated 's wishing on us ? " " It undoubtedly involves , " said Dr. Calvin , " a problem of a forbidden sort . But The Brain is considerably different from Consolidated 's robot . " " That 's right , chief . That 's right . " The general managerwas energetically interruptive . " I want you to get this , because it 's the whole point of the situation . " Susan Calvin 's eyes glittered behind the spectacles , and she continued patiently , " You see , sir , Consolidated 's machines , their Super-Thinker among them , are built withoutpersonality . They go in for functionalism , you know  --  they have to , without U. S. Robot 's basic patents for the emotional brain paths . Their Thinker is merely a calculatingmachine on a grand scale , and a dilemma ruins it instantly . " However , The Brain , our own machine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supremely deductive brain , but it resembles an idiot savante . It does n't really understand what it does  --  it just does it . And because it is really a child , it is more resilient . Life is n't so serious , you might say . The robopsychologist continued : " Here is what we 're going to do . We have divided all of Consolidated 's informationinto logical units . We are going to feed the units to The Brain singly and cautiously . When the factor enters  --  theone that creates the dilemma  --  The Brain 's child personality will hesitate . Its sense of judgment is not mature . There will be a perceptible interval before it will recognize a dilemma as such . And in that interval , it will reject the unit automatically  --  before its brain-paths can be set in motion and ruined . " Robertson 's Adam's-apple squirmed , " Are you sure , now ? " Dr. Calvin masked impatience , " It does n't make much sense , I admit , in lay language ; but there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assure you , it is as I say . " The general manager was in the breach instantly and fluently , " So here 's the situation , chief . If we take the deal , we can put it through like this . The Brain will tell us which unit of information involves the dilemma . From there , we can figure why the dilemma . Is n't that right , Dr. Bogert ? There you are , chief , and Dr. Bogert is the best mathematician you 'll find anywhere . We give Consolidateda " No Solution " answer , with the reason , and collect a hundred thousand . They 're left with a broken machine ; we 're left with a whole one . In a year , two maybe , we 'll have a space-warp engine , or a hyper-atomic motor , some people call it . Whatever you name it , it will be the biggest thing in the world . " 172 I , ROBOT Robertson chuckled and reached out , " Let 's see the contract . I 'll sign it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Brain , one of the current shift of tech- nicians had just asked it : " If one and a half chickens lay one and a half eggs in one and a half days , how many eggs will nine chickens lay in nine days ? " The Brain had just answered , " Fifty-four . " And the technician had just said to another , " See , you dope ! " Dr. Calvin coughed and there was a sudden impossible flurry of directionless energy . The psychologist motioned briefly , and she was alone with The Brain . The Brain was a two-foot globe merely  --  one which con- tamed within it a thoroughly conditioned helium atmos- phere , a volume of space completely vibration-absent and radiation-free  --  and within that was that unheard-of com- plexity of positronic grain-paths that was The Brain . The rest of the room was crowded with the attachments that were the intermediaries between The Brain and the out- side world  --  its voice , its arms , its sense organs . Dr. Calvin said softly , " How are you , Brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Swell , Miss Susan . You 're going to ask me something . I can tell . You always have a book in your hand when you 're going to ask me something . " Dr. Calvin smiled mildly , " Well , you 're right , but not just yet . This is going to be a question . It will be so corn- plicated we 're going to give it to you in writing . But not just yet . I think I 'll talk to you first . " " All right . I do n't mind talking . " " Now , Brain , in a little while , Dr. Lanning and Dr. Bogert will be here with this complicated question . We 'll give it to you a very little at a time and very slowly , be- cause we want you to be careful . We 're going to ask you to build something , if you can , out of the information , but I 'm going to warn you now that the solution might involve . . . uh . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The exclamation was hushed , drawn-out . " Now you watch for that . When we come to a sheet which means damage , even maybe death , do n't get excited . You see , Brain , in this case , we do n't mind  --  not even about death ; we do n't mind at all . So when you come to that sheet , just stop , give it back  --  and that 'll be all . You understand ? " " Oh , sure . But golly , the death of humans ! Oh , my ! " " Now , Brain , I hear Dr. Lanning and Dr. Bogert coming . They 'll tell you what the problem is all about and then we 'll start . Be a good boy , now  --  " Slowly the sheets were fed in . After each one came the interval of the queerly whispery chuckling noise that was The Brain in action . Then the silence that meant readinessfor another sheet . It was a matter of hours  --  during which the equivalent of something like seventeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the process went on , frowns appeared and deepened . Lanning muttered ferociously under his breath . Bogert first gazed speculatively at his fingernails , and then bit at them in abstracted fashion . It was when the last of the thick pile of sheets disappeared that Calvin , white-faced , said : " Something 's wrong . " Lanning barely got the words out , " It ca n't be . Is it-dead ? " " Brain ? " Susan Calvin was trembling . " Do you hear me , Brain ? " " Huh ? " came the abstracted rejoinder . " Do you want me ? " " The solution  --  " " Oh , that ! I can do it . I 'll build you a whole ship , just as easy  --  if you let me have the robots . A nice ship . It 'll take two months maybe . " " There was  --  no difficulty ? " 174 I , ROBOT " It took long to figure , " said The Brain . Dr. Calvin backed away . The color had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . In her office , she said , " I ca n't understand it . The in- formation , as given , must involve a dilemma  --  probably involves death . If something has gone wrong  --  " Bogert said quietly , " The machine talks and makes sense . It ca n't be a dilemma . " But the psychologist replied urgently , " There are di- lemmas and dilemmas . There are different forms of escape . Suppose The Brain is only mildly caught ; just badly enough , say , to be suffering from the delusion that he can solve the problem , when he ca n't . Or suppose it 's teetering on the brink of something really bad , so that any small push shoves it over . " " Suppose , " said Lanning , " there is no dilemma . Sup- pose Consolidated 's machine broke down over a different question , or broke down for purely mechanical reasons . " " But even so , " insisted Calvin , " we could n't take chances . Listen from now on , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm taking over . " " All right , " sighed Lanning , " take over , then . And meanwhile we 'll let The Brain build its ship . And if it does build it , we 'll have to test it . " He was ruminating , " We 'll need our top field men for that . " Michael Donovan brushed down his red hair with a violent motion of his hand and a total indifference to the fact that the unruly mass sprang to attention again imme- diately . He said , " Call the turn now , Greg . They say the ship is finished . They do n't know what it is , but it 's finished . Let 's go , Greg . Let 's grab the controls right now . " Powell said wearily , " Cut it , Mike . There 's a peculiar overripe flavor to your humor at its freshest , and the confinedatmosphere here is n't helping it . " " Well , listen , " Donovan took another ineffectual swipe at his hair , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tin ship . There 's the matter of my lost leave . And the monotony ! There 's nothing here but whiskers and figures  --  the wrong kind of figures . Oh , why do they give us these jobs ? " " Because , " replied Powell , gently , " we 're no loss , if they lose us . O.K. relax ! Doc Lanning 's coming this way . " Lanning was coming , his gray eyebrows as lavish as ever , his aged figure unbent as yet and full of life . He walked silently up the ramp with the two men and out into the open field , where , obeying no human master , silent robots were building a ship . Wrong tense . Had built a ship ! For Lanning said , " The robots have stopped . Not one has moved today . " " It 's completed then ? Definitely ? " asked Powell . " Now how can I tell ? " Lanning was peevish , and his eyebrows curled down in an eye-hiding frown . " It seems done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior is down to a gleaming finish . " " You 've been inside ? " " Just in , then out . I 'm no space-pilot . Either of you two know much about engine theory ? " Donovan looked at Powell , who looked at Donovan . Donovan said , " I 've got my license , sir , but at least readingit did n't say anything about hyper-engines or warpnavigation . Just the usual child 's play in three dimen-sions . " Alfred Lanning looked up with sharp disapproval and snorted the length of his prominent nose . He said frigidly , " Well , we have our engine men . " Powell caught at his elbow as he walked away , " Sir , is the ship still restricted ground ? " 176 I , ROBOT The old director hesitated , then rubbed the bridge of his nose , " I suppose not . For you two , anyway . " Donovan looked after him as he left and muttered a short , expressive phrase at his back . He turned to Powell , " I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greg . " " Suppose you come along , Mike . " The inside of the ship was finished , as finished as a ship ever was ; that could be told in a single eye-blinking glance . No martinet in the system could have put as much spit- and-polish into a surface as those robots had . The walls were of a gleaming silvery finish that retained no finger- prints . There were no angles ; walls , floors , and ceiling faded gently into each other and in the cold , metallic glittering of the hidden lights , one was surrounded by six chilly re- flections of one 's bewildered self . The main corridor was a narrow tunnel that led in a hard , clatter-footed stretch along a line of rooms of no interdistinguishing features . Powell said , " I suppose furniture is built into the wall . Or maybe we 're not supposed to sit or sleep . " It was in the last room , the one nearest the nose that the monotony broke . A curving window of non-reflecting glass was the first break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single large dial , with a single motionless needle hard against the zero mark . Donovan said , " Look at that ! " and pointed to the single word on the finely-marked scale . It said " Parsecs " and the tiny figure at the right end of the curving , graduated meter said " i , 000,000 . " There were two chairs ; heavy , wide-flaring , uncushioned . Powell seated himself gingerly , and found it molded to the body 's curves , and comfortable . Powell said , " What do you think of it ? " " For my money , The Brain has brain-fever . Let 's get out . " " Sure you do n't want to look it over a bit ? " " I have looked it over . I came , I saw , I 'm through ! " Donovan 's red hair bristled into separate wires , " Greg , let 's get out of here . I quit my job five seconds ago , and this is a restricted area for non-personnel . " Powell smiled in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O.K. , Mike , turn off that adrenalintap you 've got draining into your bloodstream . I was worried , too , but no more . " " No more , huh ? How come , no more ? Increased your insurance ? " " Mike , this ship ca n't fly . " " How do you know ? " " Well , we 've been through the entire ship , have n't we ? " " Seems so . " " Take my word for it , we have . Did you see any pilot room except for this one port and the one gauge here in parsecs ? Did you see any controls ? " " No . " " And did you see any engines ? " " Holy Joe , no ! " " Well , then ! Let 's break the news to Lanning , Mike . " They cursed their way through the featureless corridors and finally hit-and-missed their way into the short passage to the air lock . Donovan stiffened , " Did you lock this thing , Greg ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you ? " The lever never budged , though Donovan 's face twistedappallingly with exertion . Powell said , " I did n't see any emergency exits . If something'sgone wrong here , they 'll have to melt us out . " " Yes , and we 've got to wait until they find out that some fool has locked us in here , " added Donovan , frantically . " Let 's get back to the room with the port . It 's the only place from which we might attract attention . " But they didn't. 178 I , ROBOTIn that last room , the port was no longer blue and full of sky . It was black , and hard yellow pin-point stars spelled space . There was a dull , double thud , as two bodies collapsed separately into two chairs . Alfred Lanning met Dr. Calvin just outside his office . He lit a nervous cigar and motioned her in . He said , " Well , Susan , we 've come pretty far , and Robertson 's getting jumpy . What are you doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It 's no use getting impatient . The Brain is worth more than anything we forfeiton this deal . " " But you 've been questioning it for two months . " The psychologist 's voice was flat , but somehow dangerous , " You would rather run this yourself ? " " Now you know what I meant . " " Oh , I suppose I do . " Dr. Calvin rubbed her hands nervously . " It is n't easy . I 've been pampering it and probingit gently , and I have n't gotten anywhere yet . Its reactionsare n't normal . Its answers  --  they 're queer , somehow . But nothing I can put my finger on yet . And you see , untilwe know what 's wrong , we must just tiptoe our way through . I can never tell what simple question or remark will just . . . push him over . . . and then  --  Well , and then we 'll have on our hands a completely useless Brain . Do you want to face that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I would have thought so , but  --  " " You 're not even sure of that ? " Lanning was profoundlyshocked . " Oh , I ca n't be sure of anything ; Alfred  --  " The alarm system raised its fearful clangor with a horrifyingsuddenness . Lanning clicked on communications with an almost paralytic spasm . The breathless words froze him . He said , " Susan . . . you heard that . . . the ship 's gone . I sent those two field men inside half an hour ago . You 'll have to see The Brain again . " Susan Calvin said with enforced calm , " Brain , what happened to the ship ? " The Brain said happily , " The ship I built , Miss Susan ? " " That 's right . What has happened to it ? " " Why , nothing at all . The two men that were supposed to test it were inside , and we were all set . So I sent it off . " " Oh  --  Well , that 's nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you think they 'll be all right ? " " Right as anything , Miss Susan . I 've taken care of it all . It 's a bee-yoo-tiful ship . " " Yes , Brain , it is beautiful , but you think they have enough food , do n't you ? They 'll be comfortable ? " " Plenty of food . " " This business might be a shock to them , Brain . Unexpected , you know . " The Brain tossed it off , " They 'll be all right . It ought to be interesting for them . " " Interesting ? How ? " " Just interesting , " said The Brain , slyly . " Susan , " whispered Lanning in a fuming whisper , " ask him if death comes into it . Ask him what the dangers are . " Susan Calvin 's expression contorted with fury , " Keep quiet ! " In a shaken voice , she said to The Brain , " We can communicate with the ship , ca n't we , Brain ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by radio . I 've taken care of that . " " Thanks . That 's all for now . " Once outside , Lanning lashed out ragingly , " Great Galaxy , Susan , if this gets out , it will ruin all of us . We 've got to get those men back . Why did n't you ask it if there was danger of death  --  straight out . " " Because , " said Calvin , with a weary frustration , " that 's just what I ca n't mention . If it 's got a case of dilemma ,
