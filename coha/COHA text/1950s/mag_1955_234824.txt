Britain 's troubled aircraft industry last week got one more blow in a long series of wallops to British pride and pocketbook . British Overseas Airways Corp. , the Empire 's biggest airline , formally applied to the Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation for permission to buy 19 U.S.-built Douglas DC-7C airliners for its transoceanic routes . BOAC and its Chairman Sir Miles Thomas , who once placed their bets on the ill-fated Comet jet transports , now want a modified version of the piston-engined DC-7 of U.S. airlines , enlarged to carry 68 passengers nonstop across the Atlantic . Cost : $42.7 million . <P> " No . No . No . " At news of the request , Lord Beaverbrook 's Sunday Express exploded into enraged spluttering : " What reaction to Sir Miles 's request ? It should be : No . No . No . Not nineteen , not nine . Not a single one . . . His job is . . . to buy British-and fly British . " <P> But BOAC had no choice . Ever since the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be flying British planes around the world . But with the exception of Vickers ' short-haul Viscount turboprop ( TIME , Jan. 3 ) , most of Britain 's postwar transports , especially its long-range planes , have been expensive flops . Avro 's huge , highly touted Tudor transport failed in a series of disastrous crashes ; Saunders-Roe 's immense , ten-engined Princess flying boat has been in the prototype stage since 1946 , still needs better engines ; Bristol 's equally large Brabazon , designed to carry 100 passengers across the Atlantic , never got into production , was finally broken up and sold for scrap . And De Havilland 's famed four-jet Comet I was grounded after three crashes . <P> Flurries &; Facts . To carry BOAC into the age of nonstop transatlantic flying , the line had counted on the Comet I 's big sister , the Comet III . But its future is still clouded ; safety modifications may keep the new jet off commercial routes until 1960 . Another hope is the Bristol Britannia , a long-range , 340-m.p.h. transport with four turboprop engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered ten planes . But the Britannia , too , is a question mark . With little transport experience , Bristol is already 14 months behind schedule , will probably not deliver the first plane until 1960 . Furthermore , BOAC has serious doubts whether the plane can compete safely over transoceanic air routes . Though its range is listed as 5,100 miles , it drops to 3,900 miles at full payload , leaving only a slim margin of fuel on nonstop flights against stiff North Atlantic headwinds . <P> After the first flurries of angry disappointment last week , sensible Britons were reconciled to the unpleasant facts . Intoned London 's staid Times : " BOAC must be allowed to purchase the best aircraft for their services irrespective of the country in which they are made . Otherwise the corporation can not compete with other airlines , not merely American airlines , but all others which use American airliners where they give the best performance . "
