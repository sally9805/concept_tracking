In Korea , the Communists in recent weeks have been doing much of their fighting with loudspeakers . Red messages blare across no man 's land promising hot food , good treatment and warm shelter to Eighth Army troops who go over to the Red side . Sometimes the Reds promise liquor , women , steaks and even automobiles ( make unspecified ) . But the enemy 's loudspeaker campaign has been , to put it mildly , ineffective . He has broadcast Swedish music and talks in German to Dutch troops , the haunting strains of Carry Me Back to Old Virginny to unmoved South Koreans , and he has offered hot pork chops to Turkish Moslems . <P> The Reds mount their loudspeakers on trucks and bring them up within a mile or less of the battle line . When they broadcast music in an attempt to make American troops homesick , the U.S. artillerymen play a game called " Stop the Music " - sending over 105-mm. howitzer shells . In most cases , the G.I. gunners claim , they can stop the music with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loudspeakers that they would be in Seoul by Christmas-but made no effort to get there . For New Year 's Eve , they invited the Eighth Army boys to come on over and enjoy a big celebration . Next day they outdid themselves by threatening a " general offensive " for Sunday , Jan. 4 . When Sunday rolled around , there was no attack , major or minor . Most sectors were , in fact , unusually quiet .
