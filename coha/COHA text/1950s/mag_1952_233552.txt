In simpler days , the leading left-wing political magazines of the U.S. and Britain often stood together on issues , arms locked against the rest of the world . But all that changed after the end of World War II . Such weeklies as Britain 's New Statesman and Nation and the New Republic in the U.S. , or the left-wing Nation and the stoutly anti-Communist New Leader , have tangled in bitter squabbles ( TIME , April 2 , 1951 et seq . ) . The main issue : What is the proper liberal stand in the fight against Communism ? <P> " Book Burning . " Last week the battle on the left flared up afresh over a special 60-page issue of the Nation called How Free Is Free ? The issue reported on civil liberties in the U.S. , found them desperately menaced from all sides . Harvard Law Professor Zechariah Chafee Jr . found the U.S. turning " spies into heroes " ; Matthew ( The Robber Barons ) Josephson discovered " book-burning " in schools and libraries . Scientists , charged Harvard pinko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hard hit because they " are peculiarly vulnerable to suspicion , recrimination and punishment . " In education , entertainment , publishing , advertising and other fields , Nation contributors all turned in similar gloomy reports . <P> But to Richard H. Rovere , onetime Nation editor , much of the special issue of his old magazine was an example of " a spurious brand of anti-McCarthyism . " Writing in the New Leader , Rovere said that the Nation 's " doughface anti-McCarthyism . . . can be as dangerous as McCarthyism itself because its image of America is as false and , I am inclined to believe , as intellectually and morally disreputable as that of the Yahoos and primitives who have made McCarthy a power in the land . " <P> " Shameful Things . " The effect of the Nation 's issue , said he , " is to encourage the world to accept Radio Moscow 's view , of the U.S. , the view of this society as a disintegrating democracy , one in which the hooligan element not only strives for power as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We have seen some shameful things in this country in the past four or five years , and no one should want to see them glossed over . But when all the disagreeable facts are assembled and presented as a description of the state of American liberty , then a fraud has been perpetrated . . . What we have here in the Nation is no more than a half-truth , perhaps no more than a tenth part of the truth . From the Nation one gets the impression that individual liberty today must rely for its defense on a heroic and beleaguered little band marshaled by Nation editors Freda Kirchwey and Carey McWilliams . <P> " It is Soviet power which today breeds the anxieties which McCarthyism turns to its advantage . . . Nation Editor Freda Kirchwey disapproves of resistance , for she believes that Soviet power is an expression of the ' emerging forces of popular revolt ' . . . In the literature of appeasement before World War II , there was at least a note of genuine tragedy . It was never , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would wash us clean . "
