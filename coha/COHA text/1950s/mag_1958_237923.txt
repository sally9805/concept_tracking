" To carry commuters such as these it costs your railroad $2 for every $1 received . " So read the caption under a photograph of anonymous commuters in the New Haven railroad 's annual report , which sadly totted up a $2,363,702 deficit in 1957 . Last week , reporting an even steeper deficit of $3,018,169 just for January-February , the New Haven unhappily discovered the identity of the costly " commuters " pictured in its annual report . Names : Boston and Maine 's President Patrick B. McGinnis-who was dumped as New Haven president after a 1956 commuter revolt against late trains-his wife , and the New Haven 's chief engineer , Pete Poison . <P> Other railroads had some equally embarrassing reports for stockholders . The Pennsylvania reported that February produced the line 's fourth straight monthly loss , plunging it $11.3 million into the red in the first two months of 1958 . Last week the Pennsy turned to a harsh remedy : an " indefinite " 10% pay slash for all employees earning more than $10,000 annually , the first since 1934 except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Included in the slash , which will still save only about $200,000 , is President James Symes , who made $129,808 last year . With carloadings down 24.3% so far in 1958 , Symes foresees no Pennsy dividend this year , the first such omission in 100 years . <P> Things were even worse for the New York Central , which passed its second-quarter dividend after a January-February loss of $13.8 million . To economize , the Central will drop its fiveyear , $500 million modernization program , complete only about $20 million worth of projects under construction . The Baltimore &; Ohio in February suffered its first monthly deficit since 1951 , lost $990,000 . Though still in the black , the Chesapeake &; Ohio reported a decline in first-quarter earnings on common stock from $1.75 last year to $1.02 . <P> Only the Western lines felt relatively chipper . Their dependence on high-cost passenger traffic is far smaller , and many also operate profitable sidelines . Hard hit was Santa Fe , with a January-February drop in net from $8,900,000 to $3,700,000 because of slack freight traffic in petroleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad net slipped only 1% . Also in good shape was Southern Pacific . With rising income from pipelines and trucking affiliates , S.P. expects roughly the same earnings of $27.2 million in the first half of 1958 as in the same period last year . <P> Ten weeks after it began trying to diagnose U.S. railroad ailments , the Senate Surface Transportation Subcommittee wound up hearings last week with 2,356 pages of symptoms . Indicated cures : repeal of the wartime 10% passenger excise tax and 3% freight levy ; a possible new Government emergency loan fund to help the roads meet soaring maintenance-labor costs ; a faster tax write-off period on new equipment by cutting present depreciation rates from 40 years to 20 . The subcommittee feels that these changes are politically possible , hopefully expects legislation to bring them about by July 1 .
