A good 1,600 miles southeastward from Florida last week , watchers aboard the Navy 's salvage ship Escape spotted a white object as it hurtled out of the sky and plunged into the Atlantic . It was the nose cone of a Jupiter IRBM , launched only minutes earlier from a pad at the Cape Canaveral missile test center . Hoisted aboard Escape , the recovered cone proved that the Army had solved both the reentry problem and the accuracy problem . Hitting the target area at a range of 1,600 miles was a feat of marksmanship considerably more remarkable than nicking a dime with a rifle at 100 yds.
