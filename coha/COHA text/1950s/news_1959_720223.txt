txt A spokes-I man for the Republican majority in the Assembly reported tonight that he could see virtually no possibility of reducing Governor Rockefeller 's $277 , - 000,000 tax-increase program . The spokesman , Assemblyman Joseph F. Carlino of Long Beach , L. I. , made the statement in reporting on the results of a closed conference of Republican Assemblymen , which lasted two hours and tell minutes . The session was attended by Dr. T. Norman Hurd , ? State Budget Director ; Joseph H. Murphy , State Tax Commissioner and William J. Embler , research director of the Legislature , in addition to the elected Republicans in the Assembly . Mr. Carlino reported that no effort had been made at the conference to ascertain if enough Republican votes could be mustered to pass the budget and tax programs . This will not be done , he said , until the Legislature 's ' fiscal committees have had an opportunity to consider them and to recommend such reductions as they believe are warranted . Since the income-tax changes are expected to meet solid Democratic opposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are to pass . Because of the heavy opposi- ition that the income-tax proposal is encountering , Republican lawmakers are ' in no hurry to bring the question to a vote . Mr. Carlino indicated today that such a vote was three or four weeks away . Opposition to mounting taxes has likewise made it improbable that the Legislature can be induced to approve a Board of Regents ' request for a $57,000,000 increase in state aid for schools . Mr. Carlin reported that there had been almost no support in the conference for increasing state contributions to schools . In a measure , today 's conference was a preliminary to a scheduled public hearing on Mr. Rockefeller 's record $2,041 , - 000,000 budget and his tax program . The hearing will take place tomorrow , with Mayor Wagner of New York as the first speaker . Mayor Wagner is not expected to discuss Governor Rockefeller 's tax program , but to appeal for favorable consideration of proposals that he has advanced for more state aid and for permission to impose additional taxes in New York . A conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was also held today . It , too , ' was told by Dr. Hurd and other fiscal experts that the prospect for modifying the Rockefeller tax program was extremely bleak . Any downward revision of Mr. Rockefeller 's tax program would require a cut of $30,000 , - 000 to $40,000,000 in proposed spending , Mr. Carlino explained . While strong demands were voiced for budget-cutting , none of those that were specifically suggested would add up to such a total , he said . The bulk of the Republican opposition to the Governor 's tax programs is directed at his proposal to lower personal income tax exemptions to a uniform rate of $600 a person . They are now $1,000 for a single taxpayer and $2,500 for a married couple , plus $400 for each dependent . Relatively little opposition was voiced at either the Senate or Assembly conference to proposals to add three new brackets to the rate structure : These would make the maximum levy 10 per cent on taxable income over $15,000 instead of 7 per cent on income over $9,000 . There was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax on a withholding basis . Mr. Hurd told the Assemblymen that the Budget Bureau would issue shortly a detailed refutation of a recent charge by State Controller Arthur Levitt that Mr. Rockefeller had underestimated the revenue yield of his suggested incometax changes . Mr. Levitt is the only Democratic state administrative official . On the basis of his analysis of prospective revenue increases from the other changes in the income tax law , Mr. Levitt has declared that there is no need to lower exemptions . Mr. Carlino described today 's Assembly conference as exploratory . " The effect of suggested changes in the exemption ' proposals on revenues is so great it is impossible to adopt them , " he said . One change called for leaving exemptions where ' they are . An : other suggested change would give married taxpayers a $20 credit against their tax liability , instead of the $1.0 credit proposed by the Governor . Other proposals considered , he reported , called for an increase in the state 's share of themoney wagered on horse racing and an additional tax on savings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reported . The savings-bank tax , ' as a means of avoiding a ' general tax , was urged upon the Legislature earlier in the day by Arthur T. Roth , president of the Franklin National Bank of Long Island , A state levy on savings-bank income from investments in other states would add $70,000,000 a year to state revenues and , at the same time , encourage these backs to invest a larger share of their assets in New York , he argued . Mr. Carlin said imposing such a tax on a savings bank would require , as a matter of fairness , a similar impost on commercial-bank loans to borrowers outside the state . Such taxes , he said , would quickly impair New York 's position as the financial center of the United States . George Penney , managing ' director of the Savings Banks Association , commented earlier that savings banks already held 52 per cent of the real estate mortgages in effect within the state .                   @ @
