In the Great Slave Lake area 540 miles north of Edmonton , where Canada 's timberlands fade into bleak muskeg swamps stretching northward toward the pole , the signs of oil are as persistent as the mosquitoes . The first Canadian explorers found lakes covered with oil seeping from holes in the ground . Indians and traders skimmed it off for their cook fires , scooped up fistfuls of the rich black muck to waterproof their boots . But to commercial oilmen , the potential of the Great Slave oil has long been only a tantalizing dream . No one had much encouragement until this year . Then Phillips Petroleum and Home Oil Co. , which were exploring in the Peace River area far to the south where oil had already been found ( see map ) , brought in three wildcat wells near Lesser Slave Lake in a previously untapped rock formation that was the same as that at Great Slave Lake . The discovery touched off Canada 's biggest oil play since the great Leduc and Pembina oilfields were tapped in 1947 and 1953 . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oilmen . To get in on the continent 's hottest oil play , well over 200 companies will spend $160 million for exploration this year alone , and they are just getting started . Says Home Oil Geologist Alexander Clark : " This region is where Texas was 30 years ago . In the next 25 or 30 years , it is not unreasonable to expect there will be found hundreds of fields , some small , but others as big as anything yet found . " <P> Geological Whodunit . Behind all the excitement , which has sent Canadian oil stocks gushing up as much as 70% in recent months , is a geological thriller to rival any detective story . Back in 1921 Imperial Oil Ltd. , Jersey Standard 's Canadian subsidiary , tried to tap Great Slave 's potential with a test well at Windy Point on the western tip of the huge lake far up in Canada 's frozen Northwest Territories . The area was littered with natural oil seeps oozing from a rock strata identified as Devonian limestone . But as so often happens when oil-bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Disappointed oilmen all but gave up on the formation 's outcropping at Great Slave until last fall , when Phillips and Home Oil geologists decided that Imperial had tried to tap Windy Point 's Devonian limestone in the wrong place . In a historic gamble , the two companies decided to drill near Lesser Slave Lake , 450 miles to the south , hoping to find a heavy cap of nonporous rock that had trapped the oil in pools . <P> On April 22 , as company officials gathered round Phillips ' Kaybob well , the drill stem broke through to a formation of oil-bearing limestone nearly 10,000 ft. down . The first tests showed a natural flow of more than 2,600 bbl. a day . Nearby , Home Oil 's Swan Hills and Virginia Hills wells augered down into the same limestone formation , also found heavy concentrations of oil .
