To be able to sum up , analyze and assess the news , TIME 'S writers and editors need a superior brand of energetic reporting from their correspondents . Some examples of reporters at work for stories in this week 's TIME : <P> IT was quite a week for Charlie Mohr , TIME 'S White House correspondent . He had to rush away from a reception at the home of the Vice President of the U.S. one evening so that he would not be late for dinner with the President . Two days later he flew from New York to Moscow in the Boeing jetliner that set a new speed record . There he dogged the steps of Richard Nixon , was so close at hand so much of the time that at one point in the historic " kitchen summit " at the U.S. exhibition , Nikita Khrushchev swung around , mistook Charlie for an official member of the party , and heartily pumped his hand in fine Nixon-Kefauver fashion . After filing his reports for the cover story in NATIONAL AFFAIRS , Correspondent Mohr cabled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' sleep in the last 52 and have to knock off for a while . ' ' <P> - <P> TIME Correspondent George de Carvalho arrived at Rio de Janeiro 's Central Jail to cover the capture of slippery Financier Lowell Birrell , and found the police studying earlier TIME stories on Birrell , easily convinced them that he should be allowed to interview the prisoner , who put on a tie for the occasion . De Carvalho 's exclusive interview aroused the ire of Rio newspapermen , none of whom had been allowed to see Birrell . But like newsmen everywhere , they did not let professional jealousy stand in the way of a story , reproduced TIME articles and besieged De Carvalho for more details . <P> - <P> WHEN TIME 'S Calgary correspondent Ed Ogle headed down the Mackenzie River on assignment for this week 's report ( see THE HEMISPHERE ) on the Canadian North , he was touring a familiar beat , where he is the most widely known reporter from " outside . " ' Within the last year Ogle has gone north of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his planned stops , reported : " I had no luck getting into Tuktoyaktuk . I hired a seaplane , but storms blew ice into the bay so that no landing was possible . I finally landed ten miles out in the Arctic Ocean , then was unable to get ashore when the canoe coming out to get me was swamped in heavy seas . " In his richly detailed file on " The Great Tomorrow Country . " Reporter Ogle made it easy to get along without Tuktoyaktuk-until the next time .
