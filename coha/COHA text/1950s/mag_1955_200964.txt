The Dixon-Yates contract and its public v. private power issue landed on the floor of the House of Representatives last week and , after a noisy and bitter debate , bounced out again with an unexpectedly solid victory for President Eisenhower and for private enterprise . <P> At issue was a section of the TVA appropriation that would have 1 ) cut off the main electrical-transmission artery of the privately owned $107 million Dixon-Yates power plant at West Memphis , Ark. , and 2 ) extended the power of the Government-owned Tennessee Valley Authority by building a rival , $100 million power plant near South Fulton , Tenn . <P> The provision , as drawn by House Appropriations Committee Chairman Clarence Cannon and a group of TVA advocates , was a Democratic fiasco . President Eisenhower had asked for $6,500,000 to tie in TVA 's transmission lines with a Dixon-Yates line at the middle of the Mississippi River , so that the privately owned company could furnish the Tennessee Valley and the Atomic Energy Commission with needed reserves of electrical energy . Cannon &; Co. sluiced off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Fulton TVA plant . <P> The motion to cut off Dixon-Yates would probably have failed even as an isolated issue . But Cannon , who has a massive reputation as an astute parliamentary tactician , stupidly built in certain defeat when he diverted money to the Fulton public power plant . Many Northern Democrats were willing enough to knife Dixon-Yates , but few would vote for more Government-subsidized power for the South-power that would inevitably attract more migratory industry from the North . <P> G.O.P. Leaders Joe Martin and Charlie Halleck were quick to recognize Cannon 's blunder and to line up the Republican votes in disciplined ranks . Top Democrats were flabbergasted when they realized what Clarence Cannon had done . After three hours of debate with nearly 50 heated speeches , the House defeated the Cannon plan , 198 to 169 . Having botched matters thoroughly , the Democrats let the bill-including the funds for the TVA-Dixon-Yates link-slide through on a voice vote , and glumly sent it on to the Senate . <P> In a busy week on Capitol Hill : <P> The Senate , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence treaty . <P> Both House and Senate passed H.R. I , the watered-down Reciprocal Trade Agreements Bill , sent it off to the White House . <P> Louisiana 's Democratic Representative Overton Brooks organized 100 greedy Congressmen in a bipartisan rump caucus , blithely added $86,376,000 in home-district chitterlings to the Public Works Bill ( which included the TVA appropriations ) in one of the most blatant congressional pork-barrel operations in years . Lamented Republican Glenn Davis of Wisconsin , in a futile motion to send the bill back to committee : " There is but one way that we can purge ourselves of the shame that has descended upon us here this afternoon , and that is to recommit this bill to the committee on appropriations . " Brooks and friends brayed his motion down in a rafter-ringing voice vote , and then shouted the bill to passage .
