txt About 17,500 longshoremen roared their approval yesterday of their union 's demand that the clock be turned back on waterfront automation . The men had streamed off the docks to take part in a mass meeting called by the New York District Council of the International Longshoremen 's Association , They crammed Madison Square Garden as piers and wharves stood idle from noon to 7 P. M. to permit the maximum attendance at the meeting . The dockers , many of them in work clothes and peaked caps , murmured in agreement as speaker after speaker attacked automation as a threat to their jobs . They // cheered when the shipping industry was warned that it would have to " share the benefits " of automation with the workers who would be displaced . Pending an accord with the industry on " sharing " automation 's benefits , the dockers were told , the " status quo as of Dec. 1 , 1956 " would remain in effect on all matters of gang size and mechanization , Automation has been defined as the automatic control of machines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle large masses of data to control these processes . The two proposals  --  on " share the benefits " and " status quo " ? both of which carried by acclamation , were offered in a speech that was to have been made by Thomas W. ( Teddy ) 1Gleason , the union 's international general organizer , In his labsence the speech was read by Fred R. Field Jr. , president of the union 's New York District and chairman of the meeting . Mr. Gleason was taken ill Monday morning . The speakers , all top officers of the I. L. A. , lumped within the target area of automation the use of conveyor belts , cargo elevators in ships , the loading of big containers and trailers away from the piers and various types of bigger-than-usual loads . While most of the union leaders said that they were not against " progress , " all of them scored moves by the shipping industry to link waterfront progress with reductions in the ' size of the longshore work gangs  --  usually twenty-one men . Capt , William V. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared that the size of work gangs in the port and for different tasks was spelled out in a hard-won part of the contract with the New York Shipping Association , Anthony Anastasia , international vice president of the union and boss of the Brooklyn waterfront , saw some changes as inevitable . " We wo n't be able to stop automation in this great country , " he predicted . But he urged that as a means of sharing the benefits of increased productivity the next contract include a guarantee of six hours of work whenever a man was called , in place of the current four-hour guarantee . However , the keynote was conveyed in the words of the absent Mr. Gleason . " We are prepared to sit down now with the operators on any mutually satisfactory date to start working out these problems , " his prepared speech said . He reported that the number of hours worked by dockers in New York declined from a total of 46,000,000 in 1956 to about 42,000,000 this year . As an example of a new operation , Mr. Gleason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its new ships by conveyor belts that extend through openings in the ships ' sides and shipboard elevators in place of the usual topside hate:1 loading . He said the line wanted to use six-man gangs for this work and to dispense with standardsize gangs . Already in operation , he noted , is a " container " operation that can handle twelve tons of freight in four minutes ? " fifteen times faster than normal stowage . " He also cited the substitution of bulk for bagged . ' sugar unloading , where 350 tons ' an hour can be handled com-1 pared with fifty tons . The container operation singled out by Mr. Gleason is used by Pan-Atlantic Steamship Corporation , which lifts loaded truck trailers on and off Its East Coast and Puerto Rico freighters . The work stoppage apparently did not affect ship arrivals and departures . The union had announced the meeting more than a month ago , and ship lines had planned schedules to account for this .                  @ @ @
