txt In the Defense Production Act it is - specified that all government departments and agencies shall cooperate to further the output of essential gouds , to fortify the security of t'ae nation and to restrain price inflation . President Truman has more than once emphasized the necessity that all administrative units help one another to achieve these ends . Between the Office of Defense Mobilization , headed by Charles E. Wilson , and the United Labor Policy Committee a controversy drags on over a number of real or imaginary issues . One question in dispute is where the direction of manpower is to rest . The labor committee has expressed its desire that such authority be entrusted to the Department of Labor . Nir . Wilson has said it should be with the Manpower Ad-visory Council , a group attached to his office and described by 1-im as " a neutral body , having by law or practice responsibility to no single segment of the economy . " Secretary of Labor Tobin has appointed Dr. Frank P. Graham Defense Manpower Administrator . Mr. Wilson had already selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council . Now , who 's who in manpower direction ? Without attempting to say either who is who or who should be who in this sector of the mobilization front , we submit that here is a sad lack of that cooperation among government officers which the law calls for and the President demands . In fact it is worse than sad . It can seriously hamper the whole defense effort .
