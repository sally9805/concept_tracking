Massive ( 6 ft. , 240 Ibs . ) Henry B. Krajewski of Secaucus , N.J. has a five-acre farm with 4,000 pigs , a flourishing saloon ( " Tammany Hall Tavern " ) and political ambitions . Last week Krajewski , a black &; white pig under one arm , a petition with 1,136 signatures under the other , strode into , the New Jersey Statehouse and filed as the " poor man 's candidate " for President . <P> Krajewski explained why he had chosen the pig as his symbol : " The Democrats have been hogging the Administration at Washington , for 20 years , and it 's about time the people began to squeal . " Besides warring on too frequent changes in military uniforms , Krajewski intends to campaign for an-income-tax moratorium on all incomes below $6,000 . While he wants to win , Krajewski really favors a " two-President system . " " If you had a Democrat and a Republican in the White House at the same time , " he argues , " they 'd be so busy watching each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
