txt A to revise the planned Brooklyn approach to the Narrows bridgel was rushed through both the Assembly and Senate today . It now goes to Governor Rockefeller , whose attitude toward it is. uncertain . During the election campaign last fall , Mr. Rockefeller told Brooklyn voters that he thought major public improvements ! should be designed to preserve ' private homes where possible . I While the statement was : regarded as indefinite , it was , made with a view to capitaliz-1 ing on the opposition that ' existed to the currently planned ' route for the approach along Seventh Avenue in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn . The Legislature 's action today would nullify the action of the Board of Estimate in approving the $78,700,000 approach to the bridge . Instead of this route , which was adopted after months of debate and the opposition of Bay Ridge residents , the Legislature would require the bridge approach to follow " generally the route of the Belt Parkway " from the bridge to Third Avenue . The measure that was approved by the Legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bay Ridge . The parkway route had been rejected by Robert Moses . chairman of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority , which with the Port of New York Authority is sponsoring the $320,000,000 Narrows Bridge . Mr. Moses called the offshore and inshore Belt Parkway routes wholly impractical and " engineering nightmares . " The inshore plan , Mr. Moses said , would require moving 1,550 families and would cost $101,400,000 . The offshore proposal , he asserted , would require moving 550 families and cost $163,600,000 . Both ideas , he said , would destroy the Shore Parkway system and " do other immense damage to New York 's world-famous Narrows waterfront . " Former Gov , W. Averell Harriman twice in two successive years vetoed bills that would have altered the Seventh Avenue approach . The opponents of the Seventh Avenue plan , led by Brooklyn Borough President John Cashmore , have argued that it would uproot 10,000 persons and take $15,000,000 worth of real estate from city tax rolls . Both Mr. Harriman and Mr. Moses have held that changing the Seventh Avenue approach ! would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal funds would not be available for the Belt Parkway approach . The Federal Government has approved the approach plan adopted by the Board of Estimate as part of the Interstate Defense Highway System and will pay 90 per cent of its cost to 10 per cent by the state . Mayor Wagner said of the bills that were vetoed by Mr. Harriman that they were in " complete violation of the homerule principles outlined in the State Constitution and in the Highway Law . " He said the Legislature had no right to lay out a detailed route that a city must follow in building a highway . As approved by the Board of Estimate last Dec. 30 the Seventh Avenue approach would extend north immediately adjacent to Seventh Avenue , then swing west in the area of Sixtyfifth Street on an elevated structure to connect with the Gowanus Parkway above Third Avenue . The Gowanus Parkway would be widened to provide six traffic lanes and a center mall . Most of the votes in opposition in both the Assembly and Senate came from Democrats , but the debate against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Republican Senator from Staten Island . jeopardize construction of the bridge . Senator William T. Conklin . Republican of Brooklyn , told the Senate that the present approach was " cruel , stupid and arrogant . " The route was picked by the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority , headed by Mr , Moses , and the Port of New York Authority , which are jointly undertaking the construction of the bridge . The Senator told the Legislature that it had created a Frankenstein monster when it set up these authorities and pleaded : " Let 's show that we have control of it . " One of the arguments advanced in the Assembly by Mr. Amann was that passage of the bill Would put Governor Rockefeller on a political spot . If he vetoed the bill , the Assemblyman observed , the Governor would offend the people of Bay Ridge , who normally vote Republican , and if he signed it , he would offend the People of Staten Island , who likewise usually vote Republican . Since the measure is not expected to reach the Governor 's desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thirty days from then to make up his mind to sign or veto it . The Staten Island objection to the bill was that it would delay the start of the $320 , - 000,000 span that will link the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn and Staten Island . Assemblymen Edward J. Amann Jr . and Lucio F. Russo , the two Staten Island representatives , contended that the revised approach would fail to qualify for Federal aid .
