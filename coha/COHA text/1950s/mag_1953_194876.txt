The British in Moscow , like the Americans before them , last week got an eviction notice from their Russian landlords . They were given three months to find a new building for their embassy and get out of the 19th century sugar-baron 's mansion across the Moskva river from the Kremlin , which they have occupied for nearly 25 years . <P> For one minor member of the embassy staff , 31-year-old Storekeeper George Bundock , the order raised a special complication . Since he was convicted in 1948 on a morals charge involving a Russian girl and sentenced to 18 months in prison , Bundock has stayed in the embassy , with the cooperation of the British government , which felt that the Russians had railroaded him . When moving day comes , Bundock will have to ride through Moscow to whatever new quarters the British settle in . Foreign Office diplomats have not yet figured out whether the usual diplomatic immunity will extend to moving vans or limousines , or what they can do about it if the Russians lie in wait for Storekeeper Bundock. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
