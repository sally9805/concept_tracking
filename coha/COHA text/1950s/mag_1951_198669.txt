( See Cover <P> Lester Lum Colbert is a handsome , rugged Texan with a quick smile , a quicker tongue and a big hello for everyone . At 45 , he is president of Chrysler Corp. , the second largest automaker in the world . He never lets the size of his job bother him . He likes to turn to his pretty blonde wife and drawl : " Angel , can you remember when I 've ever been kept awake by worrying ? " Angel always shakes her head . Says Tex Colbert : " Business does n't worry me . It 's a downright pleasure ! " <P> Last week , in the big Chrysler office building in Highland Park , Mich. , Tex <P> Colbert was downright joyful . He gave a party for 450 newsmen and showed them his new 1951 models-Chryslers , Dodges , Plymouths , De Sotos ; sedans , convertibles , hardtops and station wagons . <P> President Colbert ( pronounced Cahl-bert ) hustled everywhere , greeting swarms of acquaintances with rarely a slip on a first name , meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he held a chrome tray overhead like a gong , whacked it with a spoon , and led the parade of guests to the dining room . <P> Push &; Pull . There was plenty to beat a gong about . Chrysler had spent $50 million retooling for its new cars , and they contained the greatest batch of engineering changes in years . <P> Most important change was a new 180-horsepower engine , the most powerful automobile engine on the road , which Chrysler spent five years developing . ( Next most powerful : Cadillac and Packard . ) Chrysler described its new V-8 " FirePower " engine as " revolutionary " - and with reason . Though it has 33% more horsepower , the engine weighs 8% less than Chrysler 's old eight-in-line engine . A high-compression engine ( 7.5 to 1 ) , the Fire-Power nevertheless operates efficiently , and at a 10% saving , on regular grades of gas . <P> Other engineering changes : A new hydraulic steering mechanism , the " Hydraguide , " which eliminates 80% of the pushing &; pulling normally done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curb with one finger on the wheel . New shock absorbers which take the bumps out of the roughest ride . Forced air cooling that cuts the wear &; tear on brake linings . A peppy new torque converter transmission , as good as Buick 's Dynaflow or Oldsmobile 's Hydra-Matic . <P> This year , only the toplofty Chrysler Imperials ( $3,080-$5,383 ) and New Yorkers ( $2,756-$3,263 ) will have the 180-h.p. engine and optional Hydraguide steering . But , barring war , Chrysler expects to spread the improvements ( including the engine , but smaller and with less horsepower ) to all its cars . <P> On the outside the cars were changed , too . On all models , last year 's boxy body has been rounded , window space has been increased , as has headroom and seat room , although the overall length of some models has been slightly cut . The De Soto has a more powerful 116-h.p. engine ( v. 112-h.p. last year ) . Dodge and Plymouth have heavier grilles and bumpers . All interiors have new fabrics-and design . <P> With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chrysler expects to make 300,000 in the first three months of this year , 280,000 more than in last year 's strike-riddled quarter .
