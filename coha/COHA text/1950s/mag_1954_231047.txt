Having finally evicted tough little Dictator Adib Shishekly , Syria 's successful conspirators spent their energies last week in emptying the ashtrays , rearranging the furniture , scratching the name off the mailbox and generally trying to erase all the signs that Shishekly had ever lived there . <P> Joining together in uneasy collaboration , the groups which overturned the Shishekly regime 1 ) abrogated Shishekly 's martial law decree ; 2 ) closed up the offices of his personal political party ( the Arab Liberation Movement ) ; 3 ) abolished the 1953 " Shishekly " constitution , which concentrated all power in the hands of the executive ; and 4 ) announced that there would be general elections soon-perhaps in three months . <P> To run things until the elections-or until someone else decides to move in for himself-the mixture of soldiers , nationalists , socialists and others who joined in ousting Shishekly picked as new Premier stout , bespectacled Sabri el Assali , a right-wing Damascus lawyer . Around him was assembled a Cabinet notable mostly for its lack of political notables . One exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shishekly assumed power two years ago . <P> Dawalibi , 50 , an oyster-smooth politician who suggests a corpulent Fu Manchu , is a man of pronounced dislikes ( among them : Jews , Britons , Americans ) . In World War II he worked in Berlin for a time with the pro-Nazi Mufti of Jerusalem . He professes not to fear Russia : " The Arabs would prefer a thousandfold to become a Soviet republic than a prey to world Jewry . " <P> In Beirut , where he lived in exile until last fortnight 's revolution , Dawalibi recently told a TIME correspondent : " The West wants us to forget about the enemy on our border Israel and worry about people thousands of miles away Russia . The West thinks we ought to follow them , just when they 've helped the Jews to take away the Arab 's country . . . The trouble with you Americans is that you always want other people to take your advice . You do n't take anyone else 's advice , and why should we ? "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
