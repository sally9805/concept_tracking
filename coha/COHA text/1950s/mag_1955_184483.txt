Recent pictures of new Russian bombers caused a flurry of speculation among engine experts . The Tupolev Bison , for instance , is about as big as the U.S. B-52. which has eight J57 jet engines , each rated at 10,000 Ibs. of static thrust ( but capable of substantially more ) . But the Bison has only four engines , which led the experts to conclude that they must have at least 15,000 Ibs. of thrust . <P> Close study of the Bison 's air intakes , which are 6 ft. in diameter , has convinced some experts that the new Russian engines are merely large , clumsy turbojets built on old principles and probably rather inefficient . Others draw a less comforting conclusion : that the large intakes point to bypass engines , a much discussed type that may prove ideal for long-range , high-speed bombers . <P> The Too-Fast Stream . One of the disadvantages of the conventional turbojet engine is its lack of propulsive efficiency . The stream of hot gas from its tailpipe speeds backward much faster than the airplane is flying forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turbulence . The efficiency would be greater if the speed of the gas stream were only moderately greater than the speed of the airplane . But conventional jet engines can not slow their gas stream without losing efficiency in other ways . <P> One cure for this situation is the turboprop , which is coming into use in transports , notably the British Viscount . Most of the energy that it develops spins a geared propeller that moves a large volume of air comparatively slowly and yields almost ideal propulsive efficiency . But propellers have many failings at high speed , and few enginemen think they will serve above . 450 m.p.h . <P> The bypass engine is an intermediate type that stands midway between the turbojet and the turboprop . It has two compressors , each driven by its own turbine through its own shaft ( see diagram ) . Some modern turbojets have this arrangement too , but all the air that is compressed passes through the combustion chambers to form the high-speed jet . In the bypass engine , part of the air from the forward compressor flows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin ) and mixes with the speeding gas in the tailpipe . It cools the stream and slows it , but adds greatly to its mass . The net result is a large , comparatively slow stream that does not waste a large amount of energy by outspeeding its airplane . <P> Range &; Quiet . Bypass engines are hard to design , and few of them have been built . Probably the leading model is the British Rolls-Royce Conway , which has been ordered for the Vickers 1000 airliner . Critics say that it does not bypass enough air to yield full efficiency , but Rolls-Royce claims that it will give top range and safety to airplanes flying above the practical speeds of turboprops . <P> Another advantage may prove more important than efficiency . The bypass engine is comparatively quiet , and this is a vital virtue for airlines that fear to fly screaming jets from airports besieged by embattled neighbors . The bypass principle can even silence the afterburner , whose bone-shaking thunder would otherwise keep it from being used to get heavy transports off the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
