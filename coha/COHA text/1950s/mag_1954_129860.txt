Tears and victory were the pattern last Saturday . Two American winners , in quite different fields and an ocean apart , wept with emotion as they triumphed . In Atlantic City , Miss California , 19-year-old Lee Ann Meriwether , choked with sobs and delight when she was crowned Miss America . And in Doncaster , England , near-octogenarian Robert Sterling Clark wept unabashed when his horse Never Say Die , a Kentucky-bred son of Nasrullah , won the ancient St. Leger before a crowd of 200,000. // A longshot winner of the Derby in June , the colt is the first American horse to win England 's classic double since Pierre Lorillard 's Iroquois accomplished the feat in 1881 . Ridden by " Cheeky Charlie " Smirke , Never Say Die was , as favorite , an easy victor by 12 lengths . The success of this American-bred horse is another link in the ever-growing chain of international racing , as Smirke rode Worden 2nd to victory last fall in Laurel 's International . // Never Say Die 's victory was hardly more surprising to American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A 78-year-old New Yorker , he is a brother of the famous Ambrose Clark , whose pearl-gray derby is a familiar sight at the New York tracks . // MAN OF MYSTERY // But unlike his brother , Robert Sterling Clark is something of a man of mystery . Uncommonly shy , he avoids photographers and reporters as though they were typhoid carriers . Nevertheless , he and his brother , F. Ambrose Clark , made newspaper headlines a decade and a half ago in a dispute about the family property at Coopers-town , N.Y . He got into a tussle with our Jockey Club about their refusal to allow the registration of certain obscure horses  --  some of which are said to have been Arabians  --  whose papers did n't meet Jockey Club requirements . Since then he has not raced in this country and his cerise and gray , blue sash , have only been seen in Europe . This despite the fact that most of his breeding operations are carried on in Kentucky and Virginia . // In addition to being a racing enthusiast Clark is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark Art Institute at Williamstown , Mass. to house his collection of paintings , sculpture and silver . Clark has gone about his collecting quietly and without fanfare and , like the late , irascible Albert Barnes , prefers not to be bothered with people wishing to see his objets d'art . Hence the new Institute at Williams College . // Never Say Die is a certainty to receive an invitation to Laurel 's International turf race in November . Maybe Mr. Clark 's double victory will cause him to mellow sufficiently to relent and let the U.S. see the American-bred horse which captured two of England 's great stakes . His cup should be running over , for on St. Leger day his Tip the Bottle won the very next race , the Town Moor . // This is certainly Nasrullah 's year . The same day Never Say Die took the St. Leger , the Del Mar Futurity was won by Blue Ruler , another of his progeny , with Willie Shoemaker aboard . // For the first time in New York racing history the weather cancelled out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aqueduct last Saturday and affected two other tracks in the East . But the Discovery Handicap , the day 's headliner , will be run off Friday Sept. 17 . So C. V. Whitney 's Fisherman will not be deprived of his chance to run in a race which he should , and in fact must , win if he 's to be given serious consideration among the top three-year-olds. // Well worth watching as a preview of the Belmont Futurity will be the Cowdin on the last day of the Aqueduct meeting . Nashua , Royal Coinage , Georgian , and Islander , all important two-year-old stake winners , are probable starters in the six-and-a-half furlong event . // Belmont 's stimulating fall meeting has 15 stakes on the flat including the all-important Futurity , which will sort out the two-year-olds , and the Jockey Club Gold Cup , which could resolve the three-year-old mix-up . Last seven runnings have been won by a sophomore . Level Lea took it last year . // A couple of box-office attractions named Shoemaker and DeSpirito will be at Belmont " in person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
