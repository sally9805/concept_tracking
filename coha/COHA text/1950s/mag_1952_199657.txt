In Cuba and Miami , the game is known as jai alai ( pronounced high lie ) . In the Basque country of France and Spain , where it became a national pastime some five centuries ago when local townfolk used to bat a ball against church walls , it is known as pelota ( the ball ) . By whatever name , it is a lightning-fast combination of handball , tennis and lacrosse , played on a concrete court varying in length from 100 ft. to the size of a football field . <P> At San Sebastian last week , deep in the heart of pelota country , 300 competitors from eight nations ( Spain , France , Argentina , Uruguay , Mexico , the Philippines , Cuba and Italy ) fought it out in the first world pelota championships . But the lineal descendants of the original simple game were so many and so varied that hardly anyone could agree on the size of the court , the resiliency of the ball , whether the game should be played barehanded , with racquets or with cestas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . *Finally , to almost no one 's satisfaction , it was agreed to play 18 different varieties of the game . It was also agreed that a nation automatically scored a championship point for every game it entered . Spain , a canny host- " and with plenty of cheek , " said one angry Frenchman-entered teams in all events and automatically picked up 18 points . <P> By the last night of the tournament , with Spain and France running neck &; neck for the world title , San Sebastian was abuzz with pelota talk . The local fronton ( court ) was crammed with 3,000 spectators straining at the wire screen that separated them from the players ( and also from the hard rubber ball , covered with goatskin , that zips up &; down the court at a 100 m.p.h. clip ) . <P> Spain and Mexico were matched at Cesta Punto ( considered the purest pelota form ) in the final . Mexico 's stocky Fernando Pareyon and Manuel Barrera , a ferocious hitter , were favored by the aficionados over the wiry Spanish brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy Catalonian textile manufacturer and oldtime pelota champion . While the Mexican team led a carefree tourist life before the match , Papa Balet whisked his sons off to a secluded retreat . <P> Better conditioned , and using a livelier ball than the Mexican variety ( bringing anguished wails from Mexican officials ) , the fast-stepping Balet brothers whipped the hard-hitting Mexicans , 40-20 . The victory gave Spain the overall championship , over runner-up France , 44-39 Noting the five-point disparity between the two countries , and recalling that Spain had entered 18 teams to France 's 13 , the elderly , greying president of the French pelota federation said bitterly : " Those damned live balls . . . Had I known about the scoring system , I would have entered myself in some of those silly games . I would have looked foolish , but France would have carried off the championship . " <P> <P> *The common denominator : the ball is served against the front wall , must land in fair territory and be scooped up in the air or on the first bounce and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by either server or receiver . Winning scores range , whimsically , from 20 to 45 for both singles and doubles .
