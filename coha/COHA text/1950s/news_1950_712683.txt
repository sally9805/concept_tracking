txt Winston Churchill , Conservative party leader , tonight hinted that he would attempt to bring Premier Stalin of Russia and the western leaders together in a " supreme effort " to end the cold war if his party wins the Feb. 23 election and he is renamed prime minister . Delivering a surprise major foreign policy speech to a huge crowd here , Churchill said he believed the superiority , if not the monopoly , of the atom bomb-fn American hands was the surest guarantee of world peace . However , he said it was his earnest hope that " some more exalted and august foundation for safety " can be found . Urges " Supreme Effort " Churchill said he did not have access to the secret information of the government nor was he fully informed 0out the attitude of the United States but added : " Still , I can not help coming back to this idea of another talk with soviet Russia on the highest level . The ideal appeals to me of a supreme effort to bridge the gulf between the two worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in friendship , at least without the hatred of cold war . " It is not easy to see how things could be worsened by a parley at the summit , if such a thing were possible . " At least I feel that Christian men should not close the door on any hope of finding a new foundation for the life of the self tormented human race . " Calls Red Forces Strongest Churchill said the soviet-communist lineup has the greatest military force but the United ' States has the atom bomb ? " and now we are told they have a thousandfold more terrible manifestation of this awful power " the hydrogen bomb . He berated the Labor administration for " one of the most extraordinary lapses that ever have taken place . " While Britain spent enormous sums on its army , navy , and air force , it seems " . very odd that we should not have been eble to make the atomic bomb for ourselves by now , " he asserted . " It is my earnest hope that we may find our way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this grim and somber balancing power of the bomb , " Churchill continued . " When I say ' we ' I must not let you forget that we ' means the United States , and it is their power which protects not only Britain , but Europe . " " Soviet Russia  --  the immensely ' powerful band of men gathered together in the Kremlin  --  has ranged itself against the western democracies . " They have added to their dominion the satellite states of Europe , the Baltic states , Poland , Czechoslovakia , Hungary , Bulgaria , Romania . Tito of Yugoslavia has broken away . Greece has broken away . Greece has been rescued by the United States , carrying on the task which we began . " At the other end of the world , the 500 millions of China have fallen into the communist sphere but I do not regard China as having finally accepted soviet servitude . Recalls ' 45 Stalin Dealings " Still when you look at the picture as a whole , you see two worlds ranged against one another more profoundly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . " I look back to 1945 when I was last in relation with Mr. Stalin and his colleagues . I read to the house of commons a year ago one of the telegrams I sent him then and I am glad to repeat these words because they express what is in my heart today . Here is what I wrote in April , 1945 : " ' There is not much comfort in looking into a future where you and the countries you domnate , . plus the Communist parties in many other states , are all drawn up on one side , and those who rally to the English speaking nation and their associates or dominions are on the other . Warns Against " Disaster " " ' It is quite obvious that their quarrel would tear the world to pieces and that all of us leading men on either side who had anything to do with that would be shamed before history . " ' Even embarking on a long period of suspicion , of abuse , and counter-abuse , and of opposing policies would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses which is attainable only by our trinity . ' " That was written nearly five years ago . Alas , it was only too true . All came to pass with horrible exactitude . But I do not blame Mr. Bevin British Foreign Secretary Bevin for that . All the talk at the 1945 election about the left speaking to the left has been proved to be foolish , but on the main issue he has done his best . " I feel that Christian men should not close the door on any hope of finding a new foundation for the life of the self-tormented human race . Cites the " Prizes " Ahead " What prizes lie before all the peoples if they are worthy of them ? peace , food , happiness , leisure , wealth for the masses never known or dreamed of , the glorious advance into a period of rest and safety for all the hundreds of millions of homes where little children play by the fire and girls grow up in all their beauty and young men strive and win . " Around us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the hope that the burden of fear and want may be lifted for a glorious era from the bruised and weary shoulders of mankind . " The war time prime minister said that when the war ended the United States , Great Britain , and Russia were what was called " the big three . " But , he added , with the decision taken by the British electorate in one day of voting in 1945 , " we lost for the time being our place and rank in world affairs which we had gained and held thruout the terrible days of struggle . " " Fell Into Difficulties " " We became a nation absorbed in its own class and party warfare , " he asserted , adding that all the countries of the free and civilized world were conscious of a sense of loss . " Then we fell into our economic difficulties and very soon , instead of being one of the world 's leaders , our sailor 's island became one of the world 's problems . " I ' recognize fully that Mr. Bevin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentials the right course in foreign policy . The execution of that policy has been marred by pitiful blunders . Mr. Bevin has managed to make British foreign policy equally disliked by France and 1Germany , by Jew and Arab , and by Communist and anti-Communist "
