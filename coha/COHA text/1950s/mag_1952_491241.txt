By CARMINE VINGO , U T was a big night for me . My first ten-rounder in the Garden I was " Bingo " Vingo and nothing was going to stop me from winning the heavyweight crown someday . This fight  --  it was with Rocky Marciano in December of 1949 when I was twenty ? was just going to be a steppingstone . But it turned out to be a steppingstone down instead of up . Today the kid who thought he could punch his way to glory is lucky he can walk , and he can just about close his left hand . The night before the big fight I did a lot of dreaming . I dreamed about getting married , buying a house somewhere in the country and owning a fancy car . I 'm married now , but if it was n't for my wife and in-laws , I do n't know what I 'd have done foras Told to SEYMOUR SHUBIN bread these past couple of years . And as for the car , they do n't like you to drive one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream and a hard fall .

This past September I went to Georgie Flores ' funeral  --  a kid who died from injuries in the ring . A lot of people were there I had n't seen in a long time . Some of them were the ones who 'd promised me so much when I was in the hospital , who 'd told me not to worry , that they 'd set me up in business or get me a job . Some of these fellows looked at me now like they 'd forgotten I was alive . After the funeral , one of them came over . " How you doing , Carmine ? " I nodded . " I 'm doing .

I remembered one fellow I fought , back in the amateurs . His name was Lou Castle and he was my buddy . I didn'tlike the idea of fighting Lou , but my manager said if you were n't willing to fight anyone , anywhere , you might as well give up . During the fight , although I still felt strange about it , I clipped Lou and he went against the ropes . That was in the first round . He was helpless , and the crowd knew it , and I knew it too . I could hear , " Kill him , Bingo ! Kill him ! " and suddenly I went crazy . The guy in front of me was n't my buddy any more . He was just something I wanted to bring down . I think I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ropes would n't let him fall , and then he slid sideways to the canvas . He pulled himself up by the ropes , and I went after him again . This time he fell hard , like a board falls . Straight back , legs stiff , arms by his sides . He was on the canvas five minutes before be came out of it , and all that time I was thinking ! I killed him ? I killed my buddy . He was my buddy again , see , and I was a human being once more . A few minutes before , I 'd wanted to knock his brains out . Remembering all this now did n't give me any pleasure . It made me a little sick , in fact . I was glad I was n't in a business any more where you were a person one minute and a killer the next . The killer was out of me . I wondered how l 'd ever had it . But to be a good fighter you 've got to have a little of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what 's going to happen to you or the other guy . I broke a couple knuckles on a guy 's head once , and once I got butted and had to have three stitches over my eye . Almost every day when I looked in the mirror I saw a different face than I 'd seen the day before , yet I still never thought I 'd get hurt bad . Queer Street or blindness or death happened only to guys you did n't know . The story I 'm telling here is mine , but it could be the story of almost any kid you 've seen in an arena or on your television set . He 's not a champ , and never will be , and probably you 've never beard his name before . He climbs through the ropes , jiggles around and waves at the crowd . He wears a robe with his name on it . Maybe he 's only making $50 or $100 out of the match , but in his own eyes he 's a big man  --  another Dempsey or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or get hurt and be carried out , but soon you 've forgotten him . Most fellows I know became boxers because they had nowhere else to go . Life usually was rough for them . They had the physical make-up , they 'd heard the stories of fancy purses , of fighters mingling in high society , and so they took the only road to glory that was open to them . My dream began when I was sixteen and behind bars , awaiting trial for stealing an automobile . It was the first time I 'd ever , got in trouble , and it scared me . The second day there , I saw , in a newspaper , a picture of my older brother , Jimmy , and it showed him as an amateur boxer . I had n't even known he was fighting . My father had been an old-time boxer , but I 'd never given any thought to fighting . But now , alone in jafi and scared , I could see where I was heading , and it was n't good . Becoming a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Funny  --  Training Behind Bars HE neighborhood where I was born was a poor I section of the Bronx , around 152nd and Morris . When I was three I got my first bad break ? a punctured right eardrum which left me deaf in that ear . As soon as I was old enough , I quit school and worked at odd jobs . When I was sixteen I left home . For weeks I slept in parked cars . Then I started " borrowing " cars , taking rides in them and parking them . Somehow I never considered it really stealing . I was just a car-crazy kid who only wanted to be behind a wheel . But making a u-turn on a one-way street put me behind bars , for that 's how a cop happened to catch me . My brother visited me in jail the day after I saw his picture . When he heard I wanted to be a fighter , he said he 'd send his manager , Billy Masselli , to see me . Before leaving , he said , " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you exercise ? " It sounds funny now , but it did n't then . I started doing knee-bends and push-ups , and I 'd shadow-box around my cell . One guard thought I 'd gone crazy . I was in jail twelve days and then put on a year 's probation . I swore I 'd never see the inside of a cell again . Billy Masselli , who 'd agreed to take me on , bought me the equipment I needed and got me a locker in Bobby Gleason 's Gym , in the Bronx . A lot of good boys were working out there then ? fellows like Jake LaMotta , Walter Cartier , Steve Belloise . I felt good every time they 'd as much as nod at me . One of them used to wear hand-painted ties , and hand-paints were the lirst things I was going to buy when I got into the money . Nat Peregine was my trainer . In Gleason 's there 's a bell that rings every three minutes , which is a round . You do everything by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , work the heavy and light bags . The sandbag is mostly for power , the speedbag for your reflexes . Nat stayed close to me . The speedbag used to give me trouble , and he 'd say patiently , " Left it , left it , right it , right it , hook it ! " I was never a " gym-beater " ? a fancy boy in training ? but soon I had that speed bag going easily , and I was able to work some pretty good steps while rope skipping . Sometimes I ' d do roadwork , early in the morning in a near-by park . Even though I was only training as an amateur , I worked out with the pros . Once I got smart with Steve Belloise and tried to K.O. him . After that the ring got too small for me . He almost chased me out to the street . But they all told me I had the stuff . My first amateur fight was in March of 1947 . Eight of us shared one dressing room . Our opponents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hooks on the walls and gear lying all around and the mixed smell of sweat and liniment . My fight was the fourth , and Billy Masselli had me shadow-box in a corner . One kid had his fight stopped because of a cut . I watched his trainer squeeze it together and put strips of adhesive tape over it , like stitches . I was nervous to begin with , and this did n't do me any good . Someone called , " Fourth bout , " and Billy nodded for me to walk out . At the door I made the sign of the cross . A lot of my friends were there , and they started cheering when they saw me . My vision was blurred . I do n't even remember climbing in the ring . In our corners , the other boy blessed himself and I did it again too . Whatever I 'd been taught about tactics , I forgot that first round . I just started throwing punches . The other boy had n't had any fights before , either , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid , but we had to be pulled apart at the bell . Back in my corner , Billy and Nat calmed me down . In the second round I was more deliberate . Toward the middle I saw an opening and shot in a right . I could feel it through my wrist . His jaw seemed to give . He fell back and then down , and on the canvas he turned over and lay on his belly . It was the first time I ' d ever made " the ship sail , " and it was a strange feeling . I had n't been sure I could knock out a guy . This kid on the floor , he did something to me . Gave me a feeling of power . Now I could lick anyone in the world . When I walked down the aisle after the count , guys were cheering me and hitting me on the back . Afterward , about twenty of us went out to celebrate . I was the king . It was like I 'd won the championship . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We marched among the tables , singing . I had to make a speech . While we were carrying on , one fellow jumps up and yells , " Here 's Carmine , here 's eeeudder guy ! Bingo ! " And he smacked a fist into his palm and dropped to the floor . Everyone roared . Someone cried , " Hey , Bingo ! " and from then on that was my name : Bingo Vingo , the kid who could n't miss . I had fifteen amateur fights after that . Each ended in a K.O. And after each one a mob went out to celebrats . Always to the same restaurant  --  our lucky restaurant . Those fights began to pay pretty good , considering that I was an amateur . I 'd get a percentage of each ticket I sold , and sometimes I 'd get rid of a couple hundred . Also , I used to win prizes , and I 'd sell these . You could get fifteen dollars for a watch ; for a penand-pencil set a little less . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Billy Masselli was the standard one okayed by the New York Boxing Commission . Of the " top " would come all expenses , such as for training camp , bandages , hotel bills . Then the manager would get 33% per cent of the rest , and the handler 10 per cent . The fighter gets what 's left , and out of that come taxes . It does n't leave too much , especially since four-rounders usually pay about $50 , sixrounders from $125 to about $300 , depending where the fight 's held . I was lucky with the two managers I had in my time . They never took their cuts , although later on I had to pay training expenses . They were willing to wait until I got a good purse . But I 'd say a lot of the boys are n't that lucky . They make fifty dollars and all the percentages and expenses come off . Kids do n't realize it 's almost impossible to become rich in the few good years a fighter 's got . I had about twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After those lickings , I won twelve straight , including two quick K.O. 's as a preliminary boy in the Garden . By then I was a neighborhood big shot . Write-ups and pictures were appearing in the papers . People said hello to me I 'd never seen before . Kids stopped me to ask for autographs . And although I was n't making any big purses yet , I was living good for a boy who 'd slept in cars not too long ago . I bought sport jackets and fancy slacks . I 'd never had more than one pair of shoes at a time in my life ; now I had three . I copied the clothes of the big-name boys , even the way they walked . One thing I was n't worried about was the future . As far as I was concerned , I was set . Why bother to learn a trade when I would n't need one ? My one big dream was someday buying a long convertible and pulling up to the corner of 152nd and Morris , casual-like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my life . I could picture the fellows and girls swarming around it , touching it , asking how much it cost , and me shrugging and saying three or four grand , like I was n't quite sure . When my contract with Billy ended around April , 1948 , Billy told me he was going to devote full time to the butcher store he owned . It was just about then that I got a call from Jackie Levine , a manager with a growing stable of big-name fighters . He said he 'd heard about me and he 'd like me to come to Stillman 's Gym , so he could look me over . Stillman 's is n't much as far as appearances go . But to me it was like heaven . Almost every fighter in New York who was anything trained there . V Jackie and Whitey Bimstein , the famous trainer , watched , I worked out on the bags . I was a little worried that they would n't think I was fancy enough , but I could n't do anything wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodding at Whitey . I was definitely on my way . Rubbing Shoulders With the Big Boys ! PROM then on , I did most of my training at Stillman 's and my roadwork around the reservoir In Central Park . Jackie sent me to my first training camp , and it was a thrill rubbing shoulders with fellows like Rocky Graziano and Gus Lesnevich . At Most camps , the big-name boys ate at separate tables from the small fry like me . I told myself that I 'd be at one of those separate tables someday . But all the fighters , small fry included , were treated like incubator babies . I remember going to a movie in town one night , walking the five miles there and back . It was dark by the time I came home . I never knew the world got so black . But walking up the road , I saw a light ahead . It was Whitey Bimstein with a lantern , guiding me in like an airplane . He 'd been searching for me everywhere , even in the well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . Meanwhile I 'd fallen in love . I 'd met Kitty Rea about the time I signed ( Continued on Page 60 ) I WAS SLAUGHTERED TO PLEASE A CROWD ( CAD ll eel from l'age 17 ) withJackie . She was something different for me . Unlike most girls I 'd met , she was n't impressed by my clippings . She told me she did n't like fighters . After we went together awhile , it turned out that it was n't so much fighters she did n't like as fighting . By the time we were going steady , she was begging me to give it up . She was afraid I 'd get hurt . I told her I 'd quit as soon as I saved enough money to start a business . Within me , I do n't know if I meant that . I had my eyes on the heavyweight crown . I 'd won all the eleven fights I 'd had under Jackie so far . How could I give it up now ? In November , 1949 , Kitty and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on December twenty-ninth , old enough to fight ten-rounders . We did n't set the date , though , because I did n't have enough money . I spoke to Jackie about getting me a big-purse fight and he said he 'd be able to get me a tenrounder at the Madison Square Garden with Rocky Marciano , an undefeated boy who 'd won twenty-three out of twenty-five by K.o. ' s . Within a few days the papers were signed . The bout was to be on Friday , December thirtieth ? the day after my birthday . The purse would be $1500 , although $400 probably would have to come out for training expenses . Kitty and I happily set our wedding date for February nineteenth . A lot of people have said since that I should never have met Marciano then , that I was pushed up too fast . After all , it was only my first ten-rounder and I 'd never gone more than six before . But I 'll never blame anyone for that fight . I wanted it because I needed the money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , but he meant nothing to me then . In fact , in some of my fights I never knew my opponent until 1 was in the ring . And Marciano being a 3-to-1 favorite did n't mean anything to me either . I never trained harder for any fight . This was my first " style " fight , and if I got by this one there would be more . On the day of the bout , I weighed in at 189 , my sharpest . The Thursday afternoon before the tight , I saw Kitty . This was my birthday , but we were n't going to celebrate it until the following night . We 'd celebrate my victory then , as well as my birthday . The guestki had been invited . Kitty said she wanted to go to the fight for luck , but I did n't want her there . I 'd never let her see any of my bouts . I 'd always been afraid she might see one lose or get cut . I think I was awake most of that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't for a long time . Not that I was fighting the actual bout beforehand . In my mind I was past the fight . I was spending the money already  --  from that purse and the purses to follow . At eight o'clock the next night I was in my dressing room . I was excited , but not nervous . You could hear the noise of the crowd echoing through the corridor . Whitey taped my hands and I shot a few punches , and then he put on the gloves . I danced up and down a little . " Show him who 's boss right away , " Jackie was saying . Then there was a loud roar and I knew the fight going on was over . Whitey tied the cord to my robe . I blessed myself twice before the call came . I walked out , Jackie and Whitey and Freddie Brown , my other handler , in back . The corridor , and then six big steps up ; the blur of faces all around . And that is all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that aisle and the fight itself , but my memory stops at those steps . The punches that knocked me out , or possibly my head hitting the canvas , wiped out all those details . The steps , and then suddenly I 'm looking up at a white ceiling and a face  --  it becomes my mother 's face  --  is over me , and I try to reach up and touch her , but I ca n't move my left arm . I 'm on a bed , and I fight to get up , but my left leg is dead too . I 'm scared and I hear my own voice moaning , " What 's the matter with me ? What 's the matter with me ? " Then another face appears  --  a man 's . The man says , " Do you know my name , Carmine ? " From the shiny piece of metal attached by a band to his head , I know he 's a doctor . And although I 've seen his face a dozen times before , I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I begin to cry . Actually , this scene in the hospital took place on the eleventh day after the fight . Those other days are dead for me. * * * * * * * * * * I can only describe them by what I 've heard . Some people have told me it was one of the ruggedest fights they 'd ever seen . It was toe-to-toe all the way . Rocky knocked me down for a nine count in the first and second rounds , but each time I came up strong . They say I staggered him in the second , and even Rocky says I almost had him in the third . Jackie tells me that up to the sixth it could have gone either way . Then I weakened . I did n't throw more than two strong punches that round , and I was bleeding from that old cut over the eye and from my nose . Jackie says he would have thrown in the towel , only it 's not allowed by the New York State Boxing Commission rules . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left hook did it . The ref counted to three , then took out my mouthpiece , because he could tell I was through , but the timekeeper finished the count . They say I got up then , but collapsed . Dr. Vincent Nardiello , physician for the Boxing Commission , rushed into the ring . , He jabbed a needle into my chest , but I still did n't come out of it . They carried me out of the ring on a stretcher . Doctor Nardiello worked over me in the dressing room . And then , out the door I 'd hoped to walk through in victory , ten men carried me on a stretcher , coats and blankets piled high on me , to it hospital nearby . I had a blood clot and there was a concussion and a small tear on the brain . They did n't think I had much chance to live . In fact , that first night a priest gave me the last rites . For the next ten days I was in and out of a coma . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jackie says my first words to him were , " Get me a rematch . " They say sometimes I 'd scream , " Where am I ? " and that I kept refighting the bout with my one good arm . I hear I scared several night nurses into quitting . Then it was the eleventh day , and my mother 's face was looking into mine and I was fully conscious at last . But I was to be on the critical list for a few more days . Learning that my entire left side was paralyzed almost crushed me . But piled on that was what I found out later . This was when I was lying on my back in bed , alone in the room . Or so I thought . Then I heard a noise on my left .. I turned my head and Kitty was sitting on a chair . She got up and stood over me . She looked worried . I asked her how long she 'd been there , and in a strange voice she answered , " A half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she said she was n't joking . In fact , she went on , I 'd even turned my eyes toward her in that time . Scared , I pleaded with her not to fool me . Instead of answering , she put a finger up to my face . When it was in front of me , I could see it . When she moved her finger to either side , I could n't , . A doctor confirmed the worst. : I was blind in the left eye , and part of the vision was gone out of my right : Today the only way I can see anything is if I 'm looking straight at it . On top of this , I was worried about my mind . That doctor  --  the one I was sure I knew , but still could n't recognize ? kept coming in every day , and the first thing he 'd ask me was his name . I could recognize everyone but him . If only I could remember his name , I 'd know my mind was okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the name came to me . Waiting for the doctor to come in , I kept repeating his name so I would n't forget . The minute he walked through the door , I shouted , " Doctor Nardiello ! " He smiled . It was a big victory for me . I had a lot of visitors while I was in the hospital . Some of the men who came to see one are pretty big in the New York boxing picture . I was feeling gloomy because , even if I got back some of my health , I did n't know how I could earn a living . Fighting was all I knew , and that was over . These men made me more promises than I can remember . They were going to hold a big benefit show for me , and surely I 'd get enough out of it to start a small business . They were going to help me begin that business or , if I did n't want that , they 'd get me a good job I could handle . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of these men that I did n't want , to live off charity . I 'll never forget his answer . " This is n't charity , kid , " he said . " It 's what the game owes you . You get hurt in any other line of work , there 's workmen 's compensation . Just think of it that way . Do n't you worry about this being charity . " Whet her they meant it or not at the time , what they said gave me the push I needed . Doctor Nardiello told me I could get back the use of my arm and legs if I worked at it . This was going to be the biggest fight of my life . The next few weeks were rough . They gave me all kinds of treatments and injections . Then they attached a board with pedals to the end of my bed and clamped my feet on them . Day after day I sweated until I was able to force those pedals around . Then they took me on a wheel chair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oat ? ell on l'age fit ) ( Cont . I from Page 60 ) work my way through parallel bars . That first day I dragged myself a little way . In about two weeks I was able to walk across that length of floor , although I still could n't let go of the bars . One morning when I was in bed , I persuaded my nurse to let me try to walk by myself . Kitty was coming and I wanted her to find me in a chair . It was a good thing a couple of friends were in the room at the time . The moment I got on my feet , I fell . My friends caught me before I hit the floor . I was in the hospital six weeks altogether . When I left , I was able to walk slowly and had got back some of the use of my arm . The doctors said it was a miracle I was even alive , let alone walking . They told me someday the entire paralysis might wear off . My vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry about as far as my mind was concerned . I took two souvenirs from the hospital . One was a cane . The other was a rubber ball that I was supposed to exercise my fingers with ? the same kind of ball I 'd used in training to get strength into my fists . I 'd been living with Kitty 's parents for some time before the Marciano fight , and that 's where I went then . A few days after my home-coming I learned something that hit me hard . It came when I asked my cousin if he 'd find out for me when I 'd be getting my purse from the fight . He wet his lips and did n't look at me as he said that all of it had gone to pay hospital and other medical expenses . For a moment I could n't believe it . I 'd realized that a private room , five doctors , medicine and nurses around the clock would cost a lot of money , but . I 'd never thought I would have to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember looking at my left hand ? the numb one , the one I could n't close yet  --  then sitting back and not being able to talk for a while . I did n't know what I was going to do . Then I remembered those promises in the hospital . In fact , a few of those same men came to see me that first week at the house . They repeated their promises : I should n't worry ; there 'd be a benefit . It was the least they could do , they said , to put one of the boys back on his feet . On the strength of this , Kitty and I got married , in March of 1950 . I 'd thrown away the cane weeks before . Not because I did n't need it , but because I was ashamed to be seen using it . When it came to that part of the wedding ceremony where I had to kneel with Kitty , I could n't force my bad leg to bend . The priest told me I could keep standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an apartment in my inlaws ' home . Kitty had a job in a garment factory and she went to work every day . I was planning the business I 'd start with the money from the benefit . Maybe a cigar or candy store . Something like that . But days and then weeks went by and I did n't hear anything about any benefit . I started to feel uneasy . They would n't forget me , would they ? Another couple of weeks passed . About a month later , even though I still was n't strong , I began looking for a job . I could n't stand being supported by Kitty any more . The only possible thing I could do was labor work because I had no training for anything else . Up to then , I had been in the trade of hurting people . Now I had nothing . My first job was in a slaughterhouse , where I had to saw bones and put large hunks of beef on hooks . I was laid off because I could n't do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing . As the months passed , I found myself always waiting for the job that was going to come through next week or the week after . Soon I lost whatever confidence I 'd had . I thought : Maybe people think there 's something wrong with my head . Maybe they 're afraid of a fighter who 's been hurt . It got so I hated to go out of the apartment or meet strangers . Once , even though the doctors told me I could never drive because of my eyes , I asked a relative to let me see if I could drive his car . I thought : Maybe if I tried . There were a few of us in the auto at the time , and he consented just to please me . I was sure I was doing fine . Suddenly I heard a scream from Kitty . Without realizing it , I had gone off the road . That incident set me back within myself even more . Just because my name and picture were in the papers following the Marciano fight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I 'll tell you what I got . Marciano , by generously donating a percentage of each purse from his next few tights , gave $2000 to the hospital and $500 to me . Rocky is one of my best friends today . Also , I got $500 from the Garden , which was payment on an insurance policy they take out on fighters . So that makes $1000 altogether that I received in cash  --  in a matter of a month or so after the bout . And , oh , yes . Just recently I ran into Jackie Levine . Jackie probably had taken this as hard as anyone . He pressed $200 on me . I did n't want to take it , it made me feel so small and helpless , but I needed the money too badly to turn it down . The money went quickly . Kitty was n't making too much , and there were always bills . When I 'd left the hospital , a doctor there had told me to come back once a week for treatments . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatments would cost something , and I could n't afford to pay . And I would n't go to a charity clinic because I was ashamed to . I did have to see a dentist , though , because I was having trouble with my gums . Within a week I lost six teeth . Once , long after the fight , I stopped at Bobby Gleason 's Gym . I felt funny about going in , but curiosity forced me . I sat on a folding chair among other visitors . A few fellows were working out . Only one guy was there from the old crowd , the only one I knew or who knew me . He was working on the speed bag . He smiled when he saw me , and nodded for me to come over . I stood next to him while he kept the bag dancing . " How you been , Carmine ? " he asked . It was n't Bingo any more . No one ever called me Bingo . " Not too bad . " I had sort of an ache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay out of the benefit ? " I frowned . " What benefit ? " He hooked the bag and caught it with both hands . " You kiddin ' me ? " He told me that some of the boys at Gleason 's had planned a benefit for me , but that they 'd been asked not to by some of the fellows downtown ? because it might interfere with the big show they were going to put on for me . " I thought for sure they 'd put it on , " he said . " I been outs town for a long time , see ? " I was n't sure if he was just apologizing or if what he said was true . But it did n't make much difference any more . " Maybe it just slipped their minds , " he said . He had the bag going again . Yeah . Slipped their minds . The way I slipped out of the minds of a lot of people . Like that time when Kitty , trying to snap me out of my gloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hated fights , but thought maybe seeing one would do me good . We were sitting at ringside . Before the main event , the announcer called several fighters to come up into the ring . I 'd been introduced here a couple times myself , in the old days . I found myself sitting forward on my chair . I wanted to be called up so badly . Rocky Marciano ? was in there now , waving . Soon all the fellows were leaving , as the fight was about to go on . Everything inside me went limp . I realized there was a nervous sweat on my palms . " They 've really forgotten all about me , " I said to Kitty . " What ? " She had n't heard . " Nothing . " I could n't wait to get out of there . September of 1951 I heard where Georgie Flores was in a hospital after a fight with Roger Donoghue . I 'd never met Flores , but what I learned made me feel like a brother to him . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty , and this had been his first big one in the Garden , for his first $1500 purse . Everything the same . Even our injuries . And where I had wanted to use my purse to get married , Flores had dreamed about using his to buy a home . I wanted to see Flores , to talk to him , to try to cheer him up . That same night I sent him a telegram : KEEP PUNCHING . MY PRAYERS ARE WITH YOU . I planned to visit him in the hospital , but the day I wanted to , he died . And BO , instead , I went to his funeral . I stood for a long while beside Flores ' coffin . In back , his pretty wife was crying her heart out , and Roger Donoghue was sitting , his face pale and tight . I 'd known Roger from before and , later , I said a few words to him . He just nodded . Then I walked over to Mrs. Flores . I ca n't explain what had got into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this , talking to strangers , telling them what was in my heart . But I had to talk to Mrs. Flores . I had to tell her how sorry I was . I do n't remember everything I said to her , but it came from deep inside , and my heart was pounding all the time . A few days afterward I was to hear that she said she wanted the whole world to know that " the life of a single boy is worth more than all the dollars prize fighters earn for those who run them : " After the funeral , I walked by myself for blocks . I could n't get that kid out of my mind . Then it came to me that here I was walking , arms swinging by my sides . That thought alone did something to me . I was supposed to have been dead , but I was walking . Sure , the old leg and arm were n't a hundred per cent , and maybe it was harder forme to do things than it used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a fighter and I was n't licked yet . And just like I decisioned Mr. Death , that 's how I 'd whip what was holding me back now . Just wait and see . I was lucky I was even alive , was n't I ? Georgie Flores , Sonny Boy West , Laverne Roach  --  all the other boys , all of them dead , they and their dreams . I was one of the lucky ones , was n't I ?
