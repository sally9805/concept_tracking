The audience in the 250-seat auditorium of the sleek new Veterans Administration Hospital in Salt Lake City last week was restless at first . But no audience ever entered more wholeheartedly into the spirit of a production . For the spectators were mental patients , and they were watching fellow patients enact a play about something they all felt intimately - the appearance of mental illness under unbearable strain . The play : The Caine Mutiny Court Martial . <P> In the therapeutic technique of psychodrama ( TIME , Jan. 24 ) , patients act out their own experiences or roles related to them ; in presenting Herman Wouk 's Court Martial , the patients did the opposite : they had to adapt themselves , like any actors , to prefabricated roles . Remarkable was the fact that they chose the play themselves , without prompting from the hospital 's recreation staff , and assigned most of the parts . <P> Too Close to Home . At first , the hospital 's top doctors were shaken by the project , judged it dangerous , and could see no benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character is mentally ill . But after watching rehearsals , the doctors were converted . Says Clinical Psychologist John Whitmyre : " Something remote would not have aroused such intense interest . This cast really knows mental illness . The patients are intense about this play because it raises the questions : ' What are the criteria for mental illness ? What is the dividing line ? ' " <P> As rehearsals went on , it was soon clear that members of the cast were gaining inner satisfaction from watching Captain Queeg , the man in position of responsibility and trust , break down under stress . As Psychiatrist Edward R. Miller explains it , this helped many patients to feel that " it could happen to anyone " - so they felt less different themselves . Also , they enjoyed the humbling of a " father-figure , " for many had troubles that traced back to their own fathers or other authoritarian figures . Best of all , characters in the play were able to act out their hostility to Father-Figure Queeg without feeling guilt . <P> This Way Out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a therapy for the play 's own good : these patients improved so much that they were discharged . One patient had seemed hopeless , despite a variety of treatments . " As he mastered his role , " says Dr. Miller , " he mastered himself and we could reach him better with psychotherapy . " He is now working to support his family , and living at home . Another patient , who at first could not remember lines for more than a few minutes , eventually memorized his part letter-perfect , and his memory for other matters improved . A third , who insisted he could not see his script or even a cue card , was won around to the point where first he read fluently , then acted his part freely .
