EAST OF EDENJust as his father could not make money , Will could not help making it . When Will Hamilton raised chickens and his hens began to lay , the price of eggs went up . As a young man , when two of his friends who ran a little store came to the point of despondent bankruptcy , Will was asked to lend them a little money to tide them over the quarter 's bills , and they gave him a one-third interest for a pittance . He was not niggardly . He gave them what they asked for . The store was on its feet within one year , expanding in two , opening branches in three , and its descendants , a great mercantile system , now dominatea large part of the area . Will also took over a bicycle-and-tool shop for a bad debt . Then a few rich people of the valley bought automobiles , and his mechanic worked on them . Pressure was put on him by a determined poet whose dreams were brass , cast iron , and rubber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans were ridiculous if not illegal . Will grumblinglyaccepted the southern half of the valley as his exclusive area , and within fifteen years the valley was two-deep in Fords and Will was a rich man driving a Marmon . Tom , the third son , was most like his father . He was born in fury and he lived in lightning . Tom came headlong into life . He was a giant in joy and enthusiasms . He did n't discover the world and its people , he created them . When he read his father 's books , he was the first . He lived in a world shining and fresh and as uninspected as Eden on the sixth day . His mind plunged like a colt in a happy pasture , and when later the world put up fences he plunged against the wire , and when the final stockade surrounded him , he plunged right through it and out . And as he was capable of giant joy , so did he harbor huge sorrow , so that when his dog died the world ended . Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would try things his father would not dare . Also , he had a large concupiscenceto put the spurs in his flanks , and this Samuel did not have . Perhapsit was his driving sexual need that made him remain a bachelor . It was a very moral family he was born into . It might be that his dreams and his longing , and his outlets for that matter , made him feel unworthy , drove him sometimes whining into the hills . Tom was a nice mixture of savagery and gentleness . He worked inhumanly , only to lose in effort his crushing impulses . The Irish do have a despairing quality of gaiety , but they have also a dour and brooding ghost that rides on their shoulders and peers in on their thoughts . Let them laugh too loudly , it sticks a long fingerEAST OF EDEN 41down their throats . They condemn themselves before they are charged , and this makes them defensive always . When Tom was nine years old he worried because his pretty little sister Mollie had an impediment in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw that a membrane under her tongue caused the trouble . " I can fix that , " he said . He led her to a secret place far from the house , whetted his pocketknife on a stone , and cut the offending halter of speech . And then he ran away and was sick . The Hamilton house grew as the family grew . It was designed to be unfinished , so that lean-tos could jut out as they were needed . The original room and kitchen soon disappeared in a welter of these lean-tos . Meanwhile Samuel got no richer . He developed a very bad patent habit , a disease many men suffer from . He invented a part of a threshing machine , better , cheaper , and more efficient than any in existence . The patent attorney ate up his little profit for the year . Samuel sent his models to a manufacturer , who promptly rejected the plans and used the method . The next few years were kept lean by the suing , and the drain stopped only when he lost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule that without money you can not fight money . But he had caught the patent fever , and year after year the money made by threshing and by smithing was drained off in patents . The Hamilton children went barefoot , and their overalls were patched and food was sometimes scarce , to pay for the crisp blueprints with cogs and planes and elevations . Some men think big and some think little . Samuel and his sons Tom and Joe thought big and George and Will thought little . Joseph was the fourth son  --  a kind of mooning boy , greatly beloved and protected by the whole family . He early discovered that a smiling helplessness was his best protection from work . His brothers were tough hard workers , all of them . It was easier to do Joe 's work than to make him do it . His mother and father thought him a poet because he was n't any good at anything else , And they so impressed him with this that he wrote glib verses to prove it . Joe was physically lazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , and his mother loved him more than the others because she thought he was helpless . Actually he was the least helpless , because he got exactly what he wanted with a minimum of effort . Joe was the darling of the family . In feudal times an ineptness with sword and spear headed a younrc42 EAST OF EDENman for the church : in the Hamilton family Joe 's inability properly to function at farm and forge headed him for a higher education . He was not sickly or weak but he did not lift very well ; he rode horses badly and detested them . The whole family laughed with affection when they thought of Joe trying to learn to plow ; his tortuous first furrow wound about like a flatland stream , and his second furrow touched his first only once and then to cross it and wander off . Gradually he eliminated himself from every farm duty . His mother explained that his mind was in the clouds , as though this were some singular virtue . When Joe had failed at every job , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was the least difficult job of all and the one classically requiring no skill . All he had to do was to stay with the sheep . And Joe lost them  --  lost sixty sheep and could n't find them where they were huddled in the shade in a dry gulch . According to the family story , Samuel called the family together , girls and boys , and made them promise to take care of Joe after he was gone , for if they did not Joe would surely starve . Interspersed with the Hamilton boys were five girls : Una the oldest , a thoughtful , studious , dark girl ; Lizzie  --  I guess Lizzie must have been the oldest since she was named for her mother  --  I do n't know much about Lizzie . She early seemed to find a shame for her family . She married young and went away and thereafter was seen only at funerals . Lizzie had a capacity for hatred and bitterness unique among the Hamiltons . She had a son , and when he grew up and married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him for many years . Then there was Dessie , whose laughter was so constant that everyonenear her was glad to be there because it was more fun to be with Dessie than with anyone else . The next sister was Olive , my mother . And last was Mollie , who was a little beauty with lovely blond hair and violet eyes . These were the Hamiltons , and it was almost a miracle how Liza , skinny little biddy that she was , produced them year after year and fed them , baked bread , made their clothes , and clothed them with good manners and iron morals too . It is amazing how Liza stamped her children . She was completely without experience in the world , she was unread and , except for the one long trip from Ireland , untraveled . She had no experience with men save only her husband , and that she looked upon as a tiresomeEAST OF EDEN 43and sometimes painful duty . A good part of her life was taken up with bearing and raising . Her total intellectual association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her children , and to them she did not listen . In that one book she had her history and her poetry , her knowledge of peoples and things , her ethics , her morals , and her salvation . She never studied the Bible or inspected it ; she just read it . The many places where it seems to refute itself did not confuse her in the least . And finally she came to a point where she knew it so well that she went right on reading it without listening . Liza enjoyed universal respect because she was a good woman and raised good children . She could hold up her head anywhere . Her husband and her children and her grandchildren respected her . There was a nail-hard strength in her , a lack of any compromise , a rightness in the face of all opposing wrongness , which made you hold her in a kind of awe but not in warmth . Liza hated alcoholic liquors with an iron zeal . Drinking alcohol in any form she regarded as a crime against a properly outraged deity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she resisted its enjoyment by anyone else . The result naturally was that her husband Samuel and all her children had a good lusty love for a drink . Once when he was very ill Samuel asked , " Liza , could n't I have a glass of whisky to ease me ? " She set her little hard chin . " Would you go to the throne of God with liquor on your breath ? You would not ! " she said . Samuel rolled over on his side and went about his illness without ease . When Liza was about seventy her elimination slowed up and her doctor told her to take a tablespoon of port wine for medicine . S  --  forced down the first spoonful , making a crooked face , but it was not so bad . And from that moment she never drew a completely sober breath . She always took the wine in a tablespoon , it was always medicine , but after a time she was doing over a quart a day and she was a much more relaxed and happy woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised and well toward adulthood before the turn of the century . It was a whole clot of Hamiltons growing up on the ranch to the east of King City . And they were American children and young men and women . Samuel never went back to Ireland and gradually he forgot it entirely . He was a busy man . He had no time for nostalgia . The Salinas Valley was the world . A trip to Salinas sixty miles to the north at the head44 EAST OF EDENof the valley was event enough for a year , and the incessant work on the ranch , the care and feeding and clothing of his bountiful family , took most of his time  --  but not all . His energy was large . His daughter Una had become a brooding student , tense and dark . He was proud of her wild , exploring mind . Olive was preparing to take county examinations after a stretch in the secondary school in Salinas . Olive was going to be a teacher , an honor like having a priest in the family in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was no damn good at anything else . Will was well along the way to accidentalfortune . Tom bruised himself on the world and licked his cuts . Dessie was studying dressmaking , and Mollie , pretty Mollie , would obviously marry some well-to-do man . There was no question of inheritance . Although the hill ranch was large it was abysmally poor . Samuel sunk well after well and could not find water on his own land . That would have made the difference . Water would have made them comparatively rich . The one poor pipe of water pumped up from deep near the house was the only source ; sometimes it got dangerously low , and twice it went dry . The cattle had to come from the far fringe of the ranch to drink and then go out again to feed . All in all it was a good firm-grounded family , permanent , and successfullyplanted in the Salinas Valley , not poorer than many and not richer than many either . It was a well-balanced family with its conservativesand its radicals , its dreamers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his loins . Chapter 61After Adam joined the army and Cyrus moved to Washington , Charles lived alone on the farm . He boasted about getting himself a wife , but he did not go about doing it by the usual process of meetinggirls , taking them to dances , testing their virtues or otherwise , and finally slipping feebly into marriage . The truth of it was that Charles was abysmally timid of girls . And , like most shy men , he satisfied his normal needs in the anonymity of the prostitute . There is great safety for a shy man with a whore . Having been paid for , and in advance , she has become a commodity , and a shy man can be gay with her and even brutal to her . Also , there is none of the horror of the possible turndown which shrivels the guts of timid men . The arrangement was simple and reasonably secret . The owner of the inn kept three rooms on his top floor for transients , which he rented to girls for two-week periods . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took their place . Mr. Hallam , the innkeeper , had no part in the arrangement . He could almost say with truth that he did n't know anything about it . He simply collected five times the normal rent for his three rooms . The girls were assigned , procured , moved , disciplined , and robbed by a whoremaster named Edwards , who lived in Boston . His girls moved in a slow circuit among the small towns , never staying anywhere more than two weeks . It was an extremely workable system . A girl was not in town long enough to cause remark either by citizen or town marshal . They stayed pretty much in the rooms and avoided public places . They were forbidden on pain of beating to drink or make noise or to fall in love with anyone . Meals were served in their rooms , and the clients were carefully screened . No drunken man was permitted to go up to them . Every six months each girl was given one month of vacation to get drunk and raise hell . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Mr. Edwards4546 EAST OF EDENpersonally stripped her , gagged her , and horsewhipped her within an inch of her life . If she did it again she found herself in jail , charged with vagrancy and public prostitution . The two-week stands had another advantage . Many of the girls were diseased , and a girl had nearly always gone away by the time her gift had incubated in a client . There was no one for a man to get mad at . Mr. Hallam knew nothing about it , and Mr. Edwards never appeared publicly in his business capacity . He had a very good thing in his circuit . The girls were all pretty much alike  --  big , healthy , lazy , and dull . A man could hardly tell there had been a ' change . Charles Trask made it a habit to go to the inn at least once every two weeks , to creep up to the top floor , do his quick business , and return to the bar to get mildly drunk . The Trask house had never been gay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gloomy , rustling decay . The lace curtains were gray , the floors , although swept , grew sticky and dank . The kitchen was lacquered  --  walls , windows , and ceiling  --  with grease from the frying pans . The constant scrubbing by the wives who had lived there and the biannual deep-seated scourging had kept the dirt down . Charles rarely did more than sweep . He gave up sheets on his bed and slept between blankets . What good to clean the house when there was no one to see it ? Only on the nights he went to the inn did he wash himself and put on clean clothes . Charles developed a restlessness that got him out at dawn . He worked the farm mightily because he was lonely . Coming in from his work , he gorged himself on fried food and went to bed and to sleep in the resulting torpor . His dark face took on the serious expressionlessness of a man who is nearly always alone . 1lc missed his brother more than he missed his mother and father . Ile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the happy time , and he wanted it to come again . During the years he was never sick , except of course for the chronic indigestion which was universal , and still is , with men who live alone , cook for themselves , and eat in solitude . For this he took a powerful purge called Father George 's Elixir of Life . One accident he did have in the third year of his aloneness . He was digging out rocks and sledding them to the stone wall . One largeEAST OF EDEN 47boulder was difficult to move . Charles pried at it with a long iron bar , and the rock bucked and rolled back again and again . Suddenly he lost his temper . The little smile came on his face , and he fought the stone as though it were a man , in silent fury . He drove his bar deep behind it and threw his whole weight back . The bar slipped and its upper end crashed against his forehead . For a few moments he lay unconscious in the field and then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a long torn welt on his forehead from hairline to a point between his eyebrows . For a few weeks his head was bandaged over a draining infection , but that did not worry him . In that day pus was thought to be benign , a proof that a wound was healing properly . When the wound did heal , it left a long and crinkled scar , and while most scar tissue is lighter than the surroundingskin , Charles ' scar turned dark brown . Perhaps the bar had forced iron rust under the skin and made a kind of tattoo . The wound had not worried Charles , but the scar did . It looked like a long fingermark laid on his forehead . He inspected it often in the little mirror by the stove . He combed his hair down over his forehead to conceal as much of it as he could . He conceived a shame for his scar ; he hated his scar . He became restless when anyone looked at it , and fury rose in him if any question was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he put down his feeling about it . " It looks , " he wrote , " like somebody marked me like a cow . The damn thing gets darker . By the time you get home it will maybe be black . All I need is one going the other way and I would look like a Papist on Ash Wednesday . I do n't know why it bothers me . I got plenty other scars . It just seems like I was marked . And when I go into town , like to the inn , why , people are always looking at it . I can hear them talking about it when they do n't know I can hear . I do n't know why they 're so damn curious about it . It gets so I do n't feel like going in town at all . " 2Adam was discharged in 1885 and started to beat his way home . In appearance he had changed little . There was no military carriage about him . The cavalry did n't act that way . Indeed some units took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sleepwalking . It is a hard thing to leave any deeply routined life , even if you hate it . In the morning he awakened48 EAST OF EDENon a split second and lay waiting for reveille . His calves missed the hug of leggings and his throat felt naked without its tight collar . He arrived in Chicago , and there , for no reason , rented a furnished room for a week , stayed in it for two days , went to Buffalo , changed his mind , and moved to Niagara Falls . He did n't want to go home and he put it off as long as possible . Home was not a pleasant place in his mind . The kind of feelings he had had there were dead in him , and he had a reluctance to bring them to life . He watched the falls by the hour . Their roar stupefied and hypnotized him . One evening he felt a crippling loneliness for the close men in barracksand tent . His impulse was to rush into a crowd for warmth , any crowd . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bar , thronged and smoky . He sighed with pleasure , almost nestled in the human clot the way a cat nestles into a woodpile . He ordered whisky and drank it and felt warm and good . He did not see or hear . He simply absorbed the contact . As it grew late and the men began to drift away , he became fearfulof the time when he would have to go home . Soon he was alone with the bartender , who was rubbing and rubbing the mahogany of the bar and trying with his eyes and his manner to get Adam to go . " I 'll have one more , " Adam said . The bartender set the bottle out . Adam noticed him for the first time . He had a strawberry mark on his forehead . " I 'm a stranger in these parts , " said Adam . " That 's what we mostly get at the falls , " the bartender said . " I 've been in the army . Cavalry . " " Yeah ! " the bartender said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , had to get under his skin some way . " Fighting Indians , " he said . " Had some great times . " The man did not answer hint . " My brother has a mark on his head . " The bartender touched the strawberry mark with his fingers . " Birthmark , " he said . " Gets bigger every year . Your brother got one ? " " His came from a cut . fie wrote me about it . " " You notice this one of mine looks like a cat ? " " Sure it does . " " That 's my nickname , Cat . Had it all my life . They say my old lady must of been scared by a cat when she was having me . " EAST OF EDEN 49 " I 'm on my way home . Been away a long time . Wo n't you have a drink ? " " Thanks . Where you staying ? " " Mrs. May 's boarding house . " " I know her . What they tell is she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much meat . " " I guess there are tricks to every trade , " said Adam . " I guess that 's right . There 's sure plenty in mine . " " I bet that 's true , " said Adam . " But the one trick I need I have n't got . I wisht I knew that one . " " What is it ? " " How the hell to get you to go home and let me close up . " Adam stared at him , stared at him and did not speak . " It 's a joke , " the bartender said uneasily . " I guess I 'll go home in the morning , " said Adam . " I mean my real home . " " Good luck , " the bartender said . Adam walked through the dark town , increasing his speed as though his loneliness sniffed along behind him . The sagging front steps of his boarding house creaked a warning as he climbed them . The hall was gloomed with the dot of yellow light from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The landlady stood in her open doorway and her nose made a shadow to the bottom of her chin . Her cold eyes followed Adam as do the eyes of a front-painted portrait , and she listened with her nose for the whisky that was in him . " Good night , " said Adam . She did not answer him . At the top of the first flight he looked back . Her head was raised , and now her chin made a shadow on her throat and her eyes had no pupils . His room smelled of dust dampened and dried many times . He picked a match from his block and scratched it on the side of the block . He lighted the shank of candle in the japanned candlestick and regarded the bed  --  as spineless as a hammock and covered with a dirty patchwork quilt , the cotton batting spilling from the edges . The porch steps complained again , and Adam knew the woman would be standing in her doorway ready to spray inhospitality on the new arrival. 50 EAST OF EDENAdam sat down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees and supported his chin in his hands . A roomer down the hall began a patient , continuing cough against the quiet night . And Adam knew he could not go home . He had heard old soldiers tell of doing what he was going to do . " I just could n't stand it . Did n't have no place to go . Did n't know nobody . Wandered around and pretty soon I got in a panic like a kid , and first thing I knowed I 'm begging the sergeant to let me back in  --  like he was doing me a favor . " Back in Chicago , Adam re-enlisted and asked to be assigned to his old regiment . On the train going west the men of his squadron seemed very dear and desirable . While he waited to change trains in Kansas City , he heard his name called and a message was shoved into his hand  --  orders to report to Washington to the office of the Secretary of War . Adam in his five years had absorbed rather than learned never to wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far gods in Washington were crazy , and if a soldier wanted to keep his sanity he thought about generals as little as possible . In due course Adam gave his name to a clerk and went to sit in an anteroom . His father found him there . It took Adam a moment to recognize Cyr us , and much longer to get used to him . Cyrus had becomea great mean . Ile dressed like a great man - black broadcloth coat and trousers , wide black hat , overcoat with a velvet collar , ebony cane which Ire made to scene a sword . And Cyrus conducted himself like a great urn Iles speech was slow and mellow , measured and unexcited , his gestrnes were wide , and new teeth gave him a vulpine smile out of all proportion to his emotion . After Adam had realtied that this was his father he was still puzzled . Suddenly he looked down - no wooden leg . The leg was straight , bent at the knee , and the foot was clad in ; r polished kid congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not a clumping woodenleggedlimp . Cyrus saw the look . " Mechanical , " he said , " Works on a hinge . Got a spring . Do n't even limp when I set my mind to it . I 'll show it to you when I take it off . Come along with nee . " Adam said , " I 'm under orders , sir . I 'm to report to Colonel Wells . " " I know you are . I told Wells to issue the orders . Come along . " Adam said uneasily , " If you do n't mind , sir , I think I 'd betterreport to Colonel Wells . " EAST OF EDEN 51His father reversed himself . " I was testing you , " he said grandly . " I wanted to see whether the army has any discipline these days . Good boy . I knew it would be good for you . You 're a man and a soldier , my boy . " " I 'm under orders , sir , " said Adam . This man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam . Something was not true . And the speed with which doors opened straight to the Colonel , the obsequiousrespect of that officer , the words , " The Secretary will see you now , sir , " did not remove Adam 's feeling . " This is my son , a private soldier , Mr. Secretary  --  just as I was  --  a private soldier in the United States Army . " " I was discharged a corporal , sir , " said Adam . He hardly heard the exchange of compliments . He was thinking , This is the Secretary of War . Ca n't he see that this is n't the way my father is ? He 's playacting . What 's happened to him ? It 's funny the Secretary ca n't see it . They walked to the small hotel where Cyrus lived , and on the way Cyrus pointed out the sights , the buildings , the spots of history , with the expansiveness of a lecturer . " I live in a hotel , " he said . " I 've thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much it would n't hardly pay . I 'm all over the country most of the time . " The hotel clerk could n't see either . He bowed to Cyrus , called him " Senator , " and indicated that he would give Adam a room if he had to throw someone out . " Send a bottle of whisky to my room , please . " " I can send some chipped ice if you like . " " Ice ! " said Cyrus . " My son is a soldier . " He rapped his leg with his stick and it gave forth a hollow sound . " I have been a soldier  --  a private soldier . What do we want ice for ? " Adam was amazed at Cyrus 's accommodations . He had not only a bedroom but a sitting room beside it , and the toilet was in a closet right in the bedroom . Cyrus sat down in a deep chair and sighed . He pulled up his trouser leg , and Adam saw the contraption of iron and leather and hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his stump and stood the travesty-on-flesh beside his chair . " It gets to pinching pretty bad , " he said . With the leg off , his father became himself again , the self Adam remembered . He had experienced the beginning of contempt , but now the childhood fear and respect and animosity came back to him , so52 EAST OF EDENthat he seemed a little boy testing his father 's immediate mood to escape trouble . Cyrus made his preparations , drank his whisky , and loosened his collar . He faced Adam . " Well ? " " Sir ? " " Why did you re-enlist ? " " I  --  1 do n't know , sir . I just wanted to . " " You do n't like the army , Adam . " " No , sir . " " Why did you go back ? " " I did n't want to go home . " Cyrus sighed and rubbed the tips of his fingers on the arms of his chair . " Are you going to stay in the army ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I can get you into . Vest Point . I have influence . I can get you discharged so you can enter West Point . " " I do n't want to go there . " " Are you defying me ? " Cyrus asked quietly . Adam took a long time to answer , and his mind sought escape before he said , " Yes , sir . " Cyrus said , " Pour me some whisky , son , " and when he had it he continued , " I wonder if you know how much influence I really have . I can throw the Grand Army at any candidate like a sock . Even the President likes to know what I think about public matters . I can get senators defeated and I can pick appointments like apples . I can make men and I can destroy men . Do you know that ? " Adam knew more than that . He knew that Cyrus was defending himself with threats . " Yes , sir . I 've heard . " " I could get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you your way about . " " I 'd rather go hack to my regiment , sir . " He saw the shadow of loss darken his father 's face . " Maybe I made a mistake . You 've learned the dumb resistance of a soldier . " He sighed . " I 'll get you ordered to your regiment . You 'll rot in barracks . " " Thank you , sir . " After a pause Adam asked , " Why do n't you bring Charles here ? " " Because I  --  No , Charles is better where he is  --  better where he is . " EAST OF EDEN 53Adam remembered his father 's tone and how he looked . And he had plenty of time to remember , because he did rot in barracks . He remembered that Cyrus was lonely and alone  --  and knew it. 3Charles had looked forward to Adam 's return after five years . He had painted the house and the barn , and as the time approached he had a woman in to clean the house , to clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean old woman . She looked at the dust-gray rotting curtains , threw them out , and made new ones . She dug grease out of the stove that had been there since Charles ' mother died . And she leached the walls of a brown shiny nastiness deposited by cooking fat and kerosene lamps . She pickled the floors with lye , soaked the blankets in sal soda , complaining the whole time to herself , " Men  --  dirty animals . Pigs is clean compared . Rot in their own juice . Do n't see how no woman ever marries them . Stink like measles . Look at oven  --  pie juice from Methusaleh . " Charles had moved into a shed where his nostrils would not be assailed by the immaculate but painful smells of lye and soda and ammonia and yellow soap . He did , however , get the impression that she did n't approve of his housekeeping . When finally she grumbled away from the shining house Charles remained in the shed . He wanted to keep the house clean for Adam . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the tools for their repair and maintenance . Charles found that he could cook his fried and boiled meals more quickly and efficiently on the forge than he could on the kitchen stove . The bellows forced quick flaring heat from the coke . A man did n't have to wait for a stove to heat up . He wondered why he had never thought of it before . Charles waited for Adam , and Adam did not come . Perhaps Adam was ashamed to write . It was Cyrus who told Charles in an angry letter about Adam 's re-enlistment against his wishes . And Cyrus indicated that , in some future , Charles could visit him in Washington , but he never asked him again . Charles moved back to the house and lived in a kind of savagefilth , taking a satisfaction in overcoming the work of the grumblingwoman . It was over a year before Adam wrote to Charles  --  a letter of54 EAST OF EDENembarrassed newsiness building his courage to say , " I do n't know why I signed again . It was like somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are . " Charles did not reply until he had received four anxious letters , and then he replied coolly , " I did n't hardly expect you anyway , " and he went on with a detailed account of farm and animals . Time had got in its work . After that Charles wrote right after New Year 's and received a letter from Adam written right after New Year 's . They had grown so apart that there was little mutual referenceand no questions . Charles began to keep one slovenly woman after another . When they got on his nerves he threw them out the way he would sell a pig . He did n't like them and had no interest in whether or not they liked him . He grew away from the village . His contacts were only with the inn and the postmaster . The village people might denounce his manner of life , but one thing he had which balanced his ugly life even in their eyes . The farm had never been so well run . ( ' harks cleared land , built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred acres to the farm . More than that , he was plaiting tobacco , and a long new tobacco barn stood impressively behind the house . For these things he kept the respect of his neighbors . A farmer can not think too much evil of a good farmer . Charles was spending most of his money and all of his energy on the farm . Chapter 71Adam spent his next five years doing the things an army uses to keep its men from going insane  --  endless polishing of metal and leather , parade and drill and escort , ceremony of bugle and flag , a ballet of business for men who are n't doing anything . In 1886 the big packinghousestrike broke out in Chicago and Adam 's regiment entrained , but the strike was settled before they were needed . In 1888 the Seminoles , who had never signed a peace treaty , stirred restlessly , and the cavalry entrained again ; but the Seminoles retired into their swamps and were quiet , and the dreamlike routine settled on the troops again . Time interval is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be reasonable to suppose that a routine time or an eventless time would seem interminable . It should be so , but it is not . It is the dull eventless times that have no duration whatever . A time splashed with interest , wounded with tragedy , crevassed with joy  --  that 's the time that seems long in the memory . And this is right when you think about it . Eventlessness has no posts to drape duration on . From nothing to nothing is no time at all . Adam 's second five years were up before he knew it . It was late in 1890 , and he was discharged with sergeant 's stripes in the Presidio in San Francisco . Letters between Charles and Adam had become great rarities , but Adam wrote his brother just before his discharge , " This time I 'm coming home , " and that was the last Charles heard of him for over three years . Adam waited out the winter , wandering up the river to Sacramento , ranging in the valley of the San Joaquin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blanket and started slowly eastward , sometimes walking and sometimes with groups of men on therods under slow-moving freight cars . At night he jungled up withwandering men in the camping places on the fringes of towns . He5 , 56 EAST OF EDENlearned to beg , not for money but for food . And before he knew it he was a bindlestiff himself . Such men are rare now , but in the nineties there were many of them , wandering men , lonely men , who wanted it that way . Some of them ran from responsibilities and some felt driven out of society by injustice . They worked a little , but not for long . They stole a little , but only food and occasionally needed garments from a wash line . They were all kinds of men  --  literate men and ignorant men , clean men and dirty men  --  but all of them had restlessness in common . They followed warmth and avoided great heat and great cold . As the spring advanced they tracked it eastward , and the first frost drove them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , being wild , lives close to man and his chickenyards : they were near towns but not in them . Associations with other men were for a week or for a day and then they drifted apart . Around the little fires where communal stew bubbled there was all manner of talk and only the personal was unmentionable . Adam heard of the development of the I.W.W. with its angry angels . He listened to philosophic discussions , to metaphysics , to esthetics , to impersonalexperience . His companions for the night might be a murderer , an unfrocked priest or one who had unfrocked himself , a professor forced from his warm berth by a dull faculty , a lone driven man running from memory , a fallen archangel and a devil in training , and each contributed hits of thought to the fire as each contributedcarrots and potatoes and onions and meat to the stew . He learned the technique of shaving with b uken glass , of judging a house before knocking to ask for a handout . Ile learned to avoid or get along with hostile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . Adam took plcasuie in the new life When autumn touched the trees he had got ; is far as ( ) maha , and without question or reason or thought he hurried west and south , fled through the mountains and arrived with relief in Southern California . He wandered by the sea from the border north as far as San Luis Obispo , and he learned to pilfer the tide pools for abalones and eels and mussels and perch , to dig the sandbars for clams , and to trap a rabbit in the dunes with a noose of fishline . And he lay in the sun-warmed sand , counting the waves . Spring urged him east again , but more slowly than before . Summer was cool in the mountains , and the mountain people were kind asEAST OF EDEN 57lonesome people are kind . Adam took a job on a widow 's outfit near Denver and shared her table and her bed humbly until the frost drove him south again . He followed the Rio Grande past Albuquerqueand El Paso through the Big Bend , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pleasure , and he learned that when people are very poor they still have something to give and the impulse to give it . He developed a love for poor people he could not have conceived if he had not been poor himself . And by now he was an expert tramp , using humility as a working principle . He was lean and sun-darkened , and he could withdraw his own personality until he made no stir of anger or jealousy . His voice had grown soft , and he had merged many accents and dialects into his own speech , so that his speech did not seem foreign anywhere . This was the beat safety of the tramp , a protective veil . He rode the trains very infrequently , for there was a growing anger against tramps , based on the angry violence of the I.W.W. and aggravated by the fierce reprisals against them . Adam was picked up for vagrancy . The quick brutality of police and prisoners frightened him and drove him away from the gatherings of tramps . He traveled alone after that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring came again he started north . He felt that his time of rest and peace was over . He aimed north toward Charles and the weakening memories of his childhood . Adam moved rapidly across interminable East Texas , through Louisiana and the butt ends of Mississippi and Alabama , and into the flank of Florida . He felt that he had to move quickly . The Negroes were poor enough to be kind , but they could not trust any white man no matter how poor , and the poor white men had a fear of strangers . Near Tallahassee he was picked up by sheriff 's men , judged vagrant , and put on a road gang . That 's how the roads were built . His sentence was six months . He was released and instantly picked up again for a second six months . And now he learned how men can consider other men as beasts and that the easiest way to get along with such men was to be a beast . A clean face , an open face , an eye raised to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment . Adam thought how a man doing an ugly or a brutal thing has hurt himself and must punish someone for the hurt . To be guarded at work by men with shotguns , to be shackled by the ankle at night to a chain , were simple matters of precaution , but the savage whippings for the least stir of will , for the smallest shred of58 EAST OF EDENdignity or resistance , these seemed to indicate that guards were afraid of prisoners , and Adam knew from his years in the army that a man afraid is a dangerous animal . And Adam , like anyone in the world , feared what whipping would do to his body and his spirit . He drew a curtain around himself . He removed expression from his face , light from his eyes , and silenced his speech . Later he was not so much astonished that it had happened to him but that he had been able to take it and with a mininnun of pain . It was much more horrible afterwardthan when it was happening . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muscles of his back show white and glistening through the cuts and to give no sign of pity or anger pr interest . And Adam learned this . People are felt rather than seen after the first few moments . Duringhis second sentence on the roads of Florida , Adam reduced his personality to a minus . Ile caused no stir , put out no vibration , becameas nearly invisible as it is possible to be . And when the guards could not feel him , they were not afraid of hint . They gave him the jobs of cleaning the camps , of handing out the slops to the prisoners , of filling the water buckets . Adapt waited until three days before his second release . Right after noon that day he filled the water buckets and went hack to the little river for more . Ile filled his buckets with stones and sank them . and then he cased himself into the water and swam a long way downstream , rested and .. earn farther down llc kept moving in the water until at dusk he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ile did not get out of the waterLate in the night he heard the hounds go by , covering both sides of the river Ile had rubbed has hail hard with green leaves to cover human odor Ile sat in the water with has nose and eyes clear . In the morning the hounds same hark , disinterested , and the men were too tired to heat the hunks properly When they were gone Adam dug a piece of sates logged fried suwlx'lly out of his pocket and ate it . Ile had schooled himself against hurry . Most nun were caught bolting . It took Adam five days to cross the short distance into Georgia . Ile took no chances , held hack his impatience with an iron control . Ile wits astonished at his ability. ( ) n the edge of Valdosta , ( ; coma , he lay hidden until long after midnight , and he entered the town like a shadow , crept to the rear of a cheap store , forced a window slowly so that the screws of the lock were pulled from the sun-rotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window open . He had to work by moonlight drifting through dirty windows . He stole a pair of cheap trousers , a white shirt , black shoes , black hat , and an oilskin raincoat , and he tried on each article for fit . He forced himself to make sure nothing looked disturbedbefore he climbed out the window . He had taken nothing which was not heavily stocked . He had not even looked for the cash drawer . He lowered the window carefully and slipped from shadow to shadow in the moonlight . He lay hidden during the day and went in search of food at night  --  turnips , a few ears of corn from a crib , a few windfall apples  --  nothing that would be missed . He broke the newness of the shoes with rubbed sand and kneaded the raincoat to destroy its newness . It was three days before he got the rain he needed , or in his extreme cautionfelt he needed . The rain started late in the afternoon . Adam huddled under his oilskin , waiting for the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dripping night into the town of Valdosta . His black hat was pulled down over his eyes and his yellow oilskin was strapped tight against his throat . He made his way to the station and peered through a rain-blurred window . The station agent , in green eyeshade and black alpaca worksleeves , leaned through the ticket window , talking to a friend . It was twenty minutes before the friend went away . Adam watched him off the platform . He took a deep breath to calm himself and went inside . Charles received very few letters . Sometimes he did not inquire at the post office for weeks . In February of 1894 when a thick letter came from a firm of attorneys in Washington the postmaster thought it might be important . He walked out to the Trask farm , found Charles cutting wood , and gave him the letter . And since he had taken so much trouble , he waited around to hear what the letter said . Charles let him wait . Very slowly he read all five pages , went back and read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he foldedit up and turned toward the house . Mr. Trask ? " The postmaster called after him , " Anything wrong , " My father is dead , " Charles said , and he walked into the houseand closed the door . " Took it hard , " the postmaster reported in town . " Took it real hard . Quiet man . Do n't talk much . " In the house Charles lighted the lamp although it was not dark yet . He laid the letter on the table , and he washed his hands before he sat down to read it again . There had n't been anyone to send him a telegram . The attorneys had found his address among his father 's papers . They were sorry  --  offered their condolences . And they were pretty excited too . When they had made Trask 's will they thought he might have a few hundred dollars to leave his sons . That is what he looked to be worth . When they inspected his bankbooks they found that he had over ninetythreethousand dollars in the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different about Mr. Trask then . People with that much money were rich . They would never have to worry . It was enough to start a dynasty . The lawyers congratulated Charles and his brother Adam . Under the will , they said , it was to be shared equally . After the money they listed the personal effects left by the deceased : five ceremonial swords presented to Cyrus at various G.A.R. conventions , an olivewood gavel with a gold plate on it , a Masonic watch charm with a diamond set in the dividers , the gold caps from the teeth he had out when he got his plates , watch ( silver ) , gold-headed stick , and so forth . Charles read the letter twice more and cupped his forehead in his hands . He wondered about Adam . He wanted Adam home . Charles felt puzzled and dull . He built up the fire and put the fryingpan to heat and sliced thick pieces of salt pork into it . Then he went back to stare at the letter . Suddenly he picked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . He decided not to think of the matterat all for a while . Of course he thought of little else , but it was a dull circular thinkingthat came back to the starting point again and again : Where had he gotten it ? When two events have something in common , in their natures or in time or place , we leap happily to the conclusion that they are similar and from this tendency we create magics and store them for retelling . Charles had never before had a letter delivered at the farm in his life . Some weeks later a boy ran out to the farm with a telegram . Charles always connected the letter and the telegram the way we group two deaths and anticipate a third . He hurried to the village railroad station , carrying the telegram in his hand . EAST OF EDEN 61 " Listen to this , " he said to the operator . " I already read it . " " You did ? " " It comes over the wire , " said the operator . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure . Urgent need you telegraph me one hundred dollars . Coining home . Adam . ' " " Came collect , " the operator said . " You owe me sixty cents . " " Valdosta , Georgia  --  I never heard of it . " " Neither 'd I , but it 's there . " " Say , Carlton , how do you go about telegraphing money ? " " Well , you bring me a hundred and two dollars and sixty cents andI send a wire telling the Valdosta operator to pay Adam one hundreddollars . You owe me sixty cents too . " " I 'll pay  --  say , how do I know it 's Adam ? What 's to stop anybody from collecting it ? " The operator permitted himself a smile of worldliness . " Way we go about it , you give me a question could n't nobody else know the answer . So I send both the question and the answer . Operator asks this fella the question , and if he ca n't answer he do n't get the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I better think up a good one . " " You better get the hundred dollars while Old Breen still got the window open . " Charles was delighted with the game . He came back with the money in his hand . " I got the question , " he said . " I hope it ai n't your mother 's middle name . Lot of people do n't remember . " " No , nothing like that . It 's this . What did you give father on his birthday just before you went in the army ? ' " " It 's a good question but it 's long as hell . Ca n't you cut it down to ten words ? " " Who 's paying for it ? Answer is , A pup . ' " " Would n't nobody guess that , " said Carlton . " Well , it 's you paying , not me . " " Be funny if he forgot , " said Charles . " He would n't ever get home . " 3Adam came walking out from the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkled and soiled from having been slept in for a week . Between the house and the barn he stopped and listened for62 EAST OF EDENhis brother , and in a moment he heard him hammering at something in the big new tobacco barn . " Oh , Charles ! " Adam called . The hammering stopped , and there was silence . Adam felt as though his brother were inspecting him through the cracks in the barn . Then Charles came out quickly and hurried to Adam and shook hands . " How are you ? " " Fine , " said Adam . " Good God , you 're thin ! " " I guess I am . And I 'm years older too . " Charles inspected him from head to foot . " You do n't look pros- perous . " " I 'm not . " " Where 's your valise ? " " I have n't got one . " " Jesus Christ ! Where 've you been ? " " Mostly wandering around all over . " " Like a hobo ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life that had made creased leather out of Charles ' skin and redness in his dark eyes , Adam knew from remembering that Charles was thinking of two things  --  the questions and something else .

Gets worse all the time . Why did n't you write ? Are you hungry ? " Charles ' hands itched into his pockets and out and touched his chin and scratched his head . " It may go away . I saw a man once  --  bartender  --  he had one that looked like a cat . It was a birthmark . His nickname was Cat . " " Arc you hungry ? " " Sure , I guess I am . " " Plan to stay home now ' ?

Carried him on a caisson with a flag over it . The Vice-President was there and the President sent a wreath . All in the papers . Pictures too  --  I 'll show you . I 've got it all . " Adam studied his brother 's face until Charles looked away . " Are you mad at something ? " Adam asked . " What should I be mad at ? " " It just sounded  --  " " I 've got nothing to be mad at . Come on , I 'll get you something to eat . " " All right . Did he linger long ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " Charles was covering up something . He wanted to tell it but he did n't know how to go about it . He kept hiding in words . Adam fell silent . It might be a good thing to be quiet and let Charles sniff and circle until he came out with it . " I do n't take much stock in messages from the beyond , " said Charles . " Still , how can you know ? Some people claim they 've had messages  --  old Sarah Whitburn . She swore . You just do n't know what to think . You did n't get a message , did you ? Say , what the hell 's bit off your tongue ? " Adam said , " Just thinking . " And he was thinking with amazement , Why , I 'm not afraid of my brother ! I used to be scared to death of him , and I 'm not any more . Wonder why not ? Could it be the army ? Or the chain gang ? Could it be Father 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the lack of fear , he knew he could say anything he wanted to , whereas before he had picked over his words to avoid trouble . It was a good feeling he had , almost as though he himself had been dead and resurrected . They walked into the kitchen he remembered and did n't remember . It seemed smaller and dingier . Adam said almost gaily , " Charles , I been listening . You want to tell me something and you 're walking around it like a terrier around a bush . You better tell before it bites you . Charles ' eyes sparked up with anger . He raised his head . His force was gone . He thought with desolation , I ca n't lick him any more . I can't. 64 EAST OF EDENAdam chuckled . " Maybe it 's wrong to feel good when our father 's just died , but you know , Charles , I never felt better in my whole life . I never felt as good . Spill it , Charles . Do n't let it chew on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father ? " " I wo n't answer you until I know what you 're getting at . " " Did you or did n't you ? " " What 's that got to do with you ? " " Tell mc . " The creative free boldness was all through Adam 's bones and brain . " All right , 1 'll tell you . No . I did n't . Sometimes he scared me . Sometimes  --  yes , sometimes I admired him , but most of the time I hated him . Now tell me why you want to know . " Charles was looking down at his hands . " I do n't understand , " he said . " I just ca n't get it through my head . He loved you more than anything in the world . " " I do n't believe that . " " You do n't have to . He liked everything you brought him . He did n't like me .

It 's right in his bureau right now . And you gave him a pup . It did n't cost you a thing . Well , I 'll show you a picture of that pup . It was at his funeral . A colonel was holding it  --  it was blind , could n't walk . They shot it after the funeral . " Adam was puzzled at the fierceness of his brother 's tone . " I do n't sec , " he said . " I do n't see what you 're getting at . " " I loved him , " said Charles . And for the first time that Adam could remember , ( ' harks began to cry . He put his head down in his arms and cried . Adam was about to go to him when a little of the old fear came back . No , he thought , if I touched him he would try to kill me . He went to the open doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother 's sniffling behind him . It was not a pretty farm near the house  --  never had been . There was litter about it , an unkemptness , a rundownness , a lack of plan ; no flowers , and bits of paper and scraps of wood scattered about on the ground . The house was not pretty either . It was a well-built shanty for shelter and cooking . It was a grim farm and a grim house , unloved and unloving . It was no home , no place to long for or to come back to . Suddenly Adam thought of his stepmother  --  as unEASTOF EDEN 65loved as the farm , adequate , clean in her way , but no more wife than the farm was a home . His brother 's sobbing had stopped . Adam turned . Charles was looking blankly straight ahead . Adam said , " Tell me about Mother . " " She died . I wrote you . " " Tell me about her . " " I told you . She died . It 's so long ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once caught on her face flashed up in his mind . Her face was projected in front of him . Charles ' voice came through the image and exploded it . " Will you tell me one thing  --  not quick  --  think before you tell me , and maybe do n't answer unless it 's true , your answer . " Charles moved his lips to form the question in advance . " Do you think it would be possible for our father to be  --  dishonest ? " " What do you mean ? " " Is n't that plain enough ? I said it plain . There 's only one meaning to dishonest . " " I do n't know , " said Adam . " I do n't know . No one ever said it . Look what he got to be . Stayed overnight in the White House . The Vice-President came to his funeral . Does that sound like a dishonest man ? Come on , Charles , " he begged , " tell me what you 've been wanting to tell me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . The blood seemed to have gone out of him , and with it energy and all ferocity . His voice became a monotone . " Father made a will . Left everything equal to me and you . " Adam laughed . " Well , we can always live on the farm . I guess we wo n't starve . " " It 's over a hundred thousand dollars , " the dull voice went on . " You 're crazy . More like a hundred dollars . Where would he get it ? " " It 's no mistake . His salary with the G.A.R. was a hundred and thirty-five dollars a month . He paid his own room and board . He got five cents a mile and hotel expenses when he traveled . " " Maybe he had it all the time and we never knew . " " No , he did n't have it all the time . " " Well , why do n't we write to the G.A.R. and ask ? Someone there might know . " " I would n't dare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go off half-cocked . There 's such a thing as speculation . Lots of men struck it rich . He knew big men . Maybe he66 EAST OF EDENgot in on a good thing . Think of the men who went to the gold rush in California and came back rich . " Charles ' face was desolate . His voice dropped so that Adam had to lean close to hear . It was as toneless as a report . " Our father went into the Union Army in June 1862 . He had three months ' training here in this state . That makes it September . He marched south . Octobertwelfth he was hit in the leg and sent to the hospital . He came home in January . " " I do n't see what you 're getting at . " Charles ' words were thin and sallow . " He was not at Chancellorsville . He was not at ( iettyshurg or the Wilderness or Richmond or Ap-pomattox . " " How do you know ? " " His discharge . It came down with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest , like beating fists , was a surge of joy . He shook his head almost in disbelief . Charles said , " I low did he get away with it ? How in hell did he get away with it ? Nobody ever questioned it . Did you ? Did I ? Did my mother ? Nobody did . Not even in Washington . " Adam stood up . " What 's in the house to eat ? I 'm going to warm up something . " " I killed a chicken last night . I 'll fry it if you can wait . " " Anything quick ? " " Some salt pink and plenty of eggs . " " I 'll have that , " said Adam . They left the question lying there , walked mentally around it , stepped over it . Their words ignored it but their minds never left it . They wanted to talk about it and could not . Charles fried salt pork , warmed up a skillet of beans , fried eggs . " I plowed the pasture , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I low did it do ? " " Just fine , once I hot the rocks out . " He touched his forehead . " I got this damn thing trying to pry out a stone .

" I guess I did n't want to think about it . It was pretty bad , most of it . " " I read about the campaigns in the papers . Did you go on those ? " " Yes . I did n't want to think about them . Still do n't . " EAST OF EDEN 61 " Did you kill Injuns ? " " Yes , we killed Injuns . " " I guess they 're real ornery . " " I guess so . " " You do n't have to talk about it if you do n't want to .

" " I did n't write about it in a letter , but they 've got girls at the inn . I .. did n't know but you 'd like to go in with me . They change everytwo weeks .

" All around the main subject the brothers beat . Now and then they would almost step into it , and quickly pull away , back into crops and local gossip and politics and health . They knew they would come back to it sooner or later . Charles was more anxious to strike in deep than Adam was , but then Charles had had the time to think of it , and to Adam it was a new field of thinking and feeling . He would have preferred to put it over until another day , and at the same time he knew his brother would not permit him to . Once he said openly , " Let 's sleep on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , " said Charles . Gradually they ran out of escape talk . Every acquaintance was covered and every local event . The talk lagged and the time went on. 68 EAST OF EDEN " Feel like turning in ? " Adam asked . " In a little while . " They were silent , and the night moved restlessly about the house , nudging them and urging them . " I sure would like to 've seen that funeral , " said Charles . " Must have been pretty fancy . " " Would you care to sec the clippings from the papers ? I 've got them all in my room . " " No . Not tonight . " Charles squared his chair around and put his elbows on the table . " We 'll have to figure it out , " he said nervously . " We can put it off all we want , but we goddam well got to figure what we 're going to do . " " I know that , " said Adam . " I guess I just wanted some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do any good ? I 've had time , lots of time , and I just went in circles . I tried not to think about it , and I still went in circles . You think time is going to help ? " " I guess not . I guess not . What do you want to talk about first ? I guess we aright as well get into it . We 're not thinking about anything else . " " There 's the money , " said Charles . " Over a hundred thousand dollars -- -a fortune . " " What about the money ' ? " " Well , where did it conic from ' ? " " How do I know ?

" " He was n't at Gettysburg . He was n't at any goddam battle in the whole war . He was hit in a skirmish . Everything he told was lies . " EAST OF EDEN 69 " What are you getting at ? " said Adam .

If it 's true we could give back the money . " Charles ' face was twisted and the scar on his forehead showed dark . " The Vice-President came to his funeral . The President sent a wreath . There was a line of carriages half a mile long and hundreds of people on foot . And do you know who the pall bearers were ? " " What are you digging at ? " " ' Spose we found out he 's a thief .

Some you can see , misshapen and horrible , with huge heads or tiny bodies ; some are born with no arms , no legs , some with three arms , some with tails or mouths in odd places . They are accidents and no one 's fault , as used to be thought . Once they were considered the visible punishments for concealed sins . And just as there are physical monsters , can there not be mental or psychic monsters born ? The face and body may be perfect , but if a twisted gene or a malformed egg can produce physical monsters , may not the same process produce a malformed soul ? Monsters are variations from the accepted normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child may be born without an arm , so one may be born without kindness or the potential of conscience . A man who loses his arms in an accident has a great struggle to adjust himself to the lack , but one born without arms suffers only from people who find him strange . Having never had arms , he can not miss them . Sometimes when we are little we imagine how it would be to have wings , but there is no reason to suppose it is the same feeling birds have . No , to a monster the norm must seem monstrous , since everyone is normal to himself . To the inner monster it must be even more obscure , since he has no visible thing to compare with others . To a man born without conscience , a soul-stricken man must seem ridiculous . To a criminal , honesty is foolish . You must not forget that a monster is only a variation , and that to a monster the norm is monstrous . It is my belief that Cathy Ames was born with the tendencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her all of her life . Some balancewheel was misweighted , some gear out of ratio . She was not like other people , never was from birth . And just as a cripple may learn to utilize his lack so that he becomes more effective in a lim-72EAST OF EDEN 73ited field than the uncrippled , so did Cathy , using her difference , make a painful and bewildering stir in her world . There was a time when a girl like Cathy would have been called possessed by the devil . She would have been exorcised to cast out the evil spirit , and if after many trials that did not work , she would have been burned as a witch for the good of the community . The one thing that may not be forgiven a witch is her ability to distress people , to make them restless and uneasy and even envious . As though nature concealed a trap , Cathy had from the first a face of innocence . Her hair was gold and lovely ; wide-set hazel eyes with upper lids that drooped made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and her cheekbones high and wide , sweeping down to a small chin so that her face was heart-shaped . Her mouth was well shaped and well lipped but abnormally small  --  what used to be called a rosebud . Her ears were very little , without lobes , and they pressed so close to her head that even with her hair combed up they made no silhouette . They were thin flaps sealed against her head . Cathy always had a child 's figure even after she was grown , slender , delicate arms and hands  --  tiny hands . Her breasts never developed very much . Before her puberty the nipples turned inward . Her mother had to manipulate them out when they became painful in Cathy 's tenth year . Her body was a boy 's body , narrow-hipped , straight-legged , but her ankles were thin and straight without being slender . Her feet were small and round and stubby , with fat insteps almost like little hoofs . She was a pretty child and she became a pretty woman . Her voice was huskily soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irresistible . But there must have been some steel cord in her throat , for Cathy 's voice could cut like a file when she wished . Even as a child she had some quality that made people look at her , then look away , then look back at her , troubled at something foreign . Something looked out of her eyes , and was never there when one looked again . She moved quietly and talked little , but she could enter no room without causing everyone to turn toward her . She made people uneasy but not so that they wanted to go away from her . Men and women wanted to inspect her , to be close to her , to try to find what caused the disturbance she distributed so subtly . And since this had always been so , Cathy did not find it strange . Cathy was different from other children in many ways , but one thing in particular set her apart . Most children abhor difference. 74 EAST OF EDENThey want to look , talk , dress , and act exactly like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is.an absurdity , it is pain and sorrow to a child not to wear that absurdity . If necklaces of pork chops were accepted , it would be a sad child who could not wear pork chops . And this slavishness to the group normally extends into every game , every practice , social or otherwise . It is a protective coloration children utilize for their safety . Cathy had none of this . She never conformed in dress or conduct . She wore whatever she wanted to . The result was that quite often other children imitated her . As she grew older the group , the herd , which is any collection of children , began to sense what adults felt , that there was something foreignabout Cathy . After a while only one person at a time associated with her . Groups of boys and girls avoided her as though she carried a nameless danger . Cathy was a liar , but she did not lie the way most children do . Hers was no daydream lying , when the thing imagined is told and , to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just ordinary deviation from external reality . I think the difference between a lie and a story is that a story utilizes the trappings and appearance of truth for the interest of the listener as well as of the teller . A story has in it neither gain nor loss . But a lie is a device for profit or escape . I supposeif that definition is strictly held to , then a writer of stories is a liar  --  if he is financially fortunate . Cathy 's lies were never innocent . Their purpose was to escape punishment , or work , or responsibility , and they were used for profit . Most liars are tripped up either because they forget what they have told or because the lie is suddenly faced with an incontrovertible truth . But Cathy did not forget her lies , and she developed the most effective method of lying . She stayed close enough to the truth so that one could never be sure . She knew two other methods also  --  either to interlard her lies with truth or to tell a truth as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lie and it turns out to be the truth , there is a backlog that will last a long time and protect a number of untruths . Since Cathy was an only child her mother had no close contrast in the family . She thought all children were like her own . And since all parents are worriers she was convinced that all her friends had the same problems . Cathy 's father was not so sure . He operated a small tannery in aEAST OF EDEN 15town in Massachusetts , which made a comfortable , careful living if he worked very hard . Mr. Ames came in contact with other childrenaway from his home and he felt that Cathy was not like other children . It was a matter more felt than known . He was uneasy about his daughter but he could not have said why . Nearly everyone in the world has appetites and impulses , trigger emotions , islands of selfishness , lusts just beneath the surface . And most people either hold such things in check or indulge them secretly . Cathy knew not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her own gain . It is quite possible that she did not believe in any other tendencies in humans , for while she was preternaturally alert in some directions she was completely blind in others . Cathy learned when she was very young that sexuality with all its attendant yearnings and pains , jealousies and taboos , is the most disturbingimpulse humans have . And in that day it was even more disturbing than it is now , because the subject was unmentionable and unmentioned . Everyone concealed that little hell in himself , while publicly pretending it did not exist  --  and when he was caught up in it he was completely helpless . Cathy learned that by the manipulation and use of this one part of people she could gain and keep power over nearly anyone . It was at once a weapon and a threat . It was irresistible . And since the blind helplessness seems never to have fallen on Cathy , it is probable that she had very little of the impulse herself and indeed felt a contempt for those who did . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . What freedom men and women could have , were they not constantlytricked and trapped and enslaved and tortured by their sexuality ! The only drawback in that freedom is that without it one would not be a human . One would be a monster . EAt ten Cathy knew something of the power of the sex impulse and began coldly to experiment with it . She planned everything coldly , foreseeing difficulties and preparing for them . ) The sex play of children has always gone on . Everyone , I guess , who is not abnormal has foregathered with little girls in some dim leafy place , in the bottom of a manger , under a willow , in a culvert under a road  --  or at least has dreamed of doing so . Nearly all parentsare faced with the problem sooner or later , and then the child is lucky if the parent remembers his own childhood . In the time of Cathy 's childhood , however , it was harder . The parents , denying it in themselves , were horrified to find it in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with late-surviving dew the young grass bristled under the sun , when the warmth crept into the ground and pushed the yellow dandelions up , Cathy 's mother finished hang- ing the washed clothes on the line . The Ameses lived on the edge of town , and behind their house were barn and carriage house , vege- table garden and fenced paddock for two horses . Mrs. Ames remembered having seen Cathy stroll away toward the barn . She called for her , and when there was no answer she thought she might have been mistaken . She was about to go into the house when she heard a giggle from the carriage house . " Cathy ! " she called . There was no answer . An uneasiness came over her . She reached back in her mind for the sound of the giggle . It had not been Cathy 's voice . Cathy was not a giggler . There is no knowing how or why dread comes on a parent . Of course many times apprehension arises when there is no reason for it at all . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , parents who have indulged in black dreams of loss . Mrs. Ames stood still , listening . She heard soft secret voices and moved quietly toward the carriage house . The double doors were closed . The murmur of voices came from inside , but she could not make out Cathy 's voice . She made a quick stride and pulled the doors open and the bright sun crashed inside . She froze , mouth open , at what she saw . Cathy lay on the floor , her skirts pulled up . She was naked to the waist , and beside her two boys about fourteen were kneeling . The shock of the sudden light froze them too . Cathy 's eyes were blank with terror . Mrs. Ames knew the boys , knew their parents . Suddenly one of the boys leaped up , darted past Mrs. Ames , and ran around the corner of the house . The other boy helplessly edged away from the woman and with a cry rushed through the doorway . Mrs. Ames clutched at him , but her fingers slipped from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running footsteps outside . Mrs. Ames tried to speak and her voice was a croaking whisper . " Get up ! " Cathy stared blankly up at her and made no move . Mrs. Ames saw that Cathy 's wrists were tied with a heavy rope . She screamed and flung herself down and fumbled at the knots . She carried Cathy into the house and put her to bed . EAST OF EDEN 77The family doctor , after he had examined Cathy , could find no evidence that she had been mistreated . " You can just thank God you got there in time , " he said over and over to Mrs. Ames . Cathy did not speak for a long time . Shock , the doctor called it . And when she did come out of the shock Cathy refused to talk . When she was questioned her eyes widened until the whites showed all around the pupils and her breathing stopped and her body grew rigid and her cheeks reddened from holding her breath . The conference with the parents of the boys was attended by Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He carried the rope which had been around Cathy 's wrists . His eyes were puzzled . There were things he did not understand , but he did not bring them up . Mrs. Ames settled down to a steady hysteria . She had been there . She had seen . She was the final authority . And out of her hysteria a sadistic devil peered . She wanted blood . There was a kind of pleasure in her demands for punishment . The town , the country , must be protected . She put it on that basis . She had arrived on time , thank God . But maybe the next time she would not ; and how would other mothers feel ? And Cathy was only ten years old . Punishments were more savage then than they are now . A man truly believed that the whip was an instrument of virtue . First singly and then together the boys were whipped , whipped to raw cuts . Their crime was bad enough , but the lies proved an evil that not even the whip could remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they said , had started the whole thing , and they had each given her five cents . They had not tied her hands . They said they remembered that she was playing with a rope . Mrs. Ames said it first and the whole town echoed it . " Do they mean to say she tied her own hands ? A ten-year-old child ? " If the boys had owned up to the crime they might have escaped some of the punishment . Their refusal brought a torturing rage not only to their fathers , who did the whipping , but to the whole community . Both boys were sent to a house of correction with the approval of their parents . " She 's haunted by it , " Mrs. Ames told the neighbors . " If she could only talk about it , maybe she would get better . But when I ask her about it  --  it 's like it came right back to her and she goes into shock again . " The Ameses never spoke of it to her again . The subject was78 EAST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservations . He would have felt bad if two boys were in the house of correction for something they did not do . After Cathy had fully recovered from her shock , boys and girls watched her from a distance and then moved closer , fascinated by her . She had no girl crushes , as is usual at twelve and thirteen . Boys did not want to take the chance of being ragged by their friends for walking home from school with her . But she exercised a powerful effect on both boys and girls . And if any boy could come on her alone , he found himself drawn to her by a force he could neither understand nor overcome . She was dainty and very sweet and her voice was low . She went for long walks by herself , and it was a rare walk when some boy did not blunder out of a woodlot and come on her by accident . And while whispers went scurrying about , there is no knowing what Cathy did . If anything happened , only vague whispers followed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many secrets and none of them kept long enough to raise a cream . Cathy developed a little smile , just a hint of a smile . She had a way of looking sideways and down that hinted to a lone boy of secrets he could share . In her father 's mind another question stirred , and he shoved it down deep and felt dishonest for thinking about it at all . Cathy had remarkable luck in finding things  --  a gold charm , money , a little silken purse , a silver cross with red stones said to be rubies . She found many things , and when her father advertised in the weekly Courier about the cross no one ever claimed it . Mr. William Ames , Cathy 's father , was a covered man . He rarely told the thoughts in his mind . He would n't have dared so far to exposehimself to the gaze of his neighbors . He kept the little flame of suspicion to himself . It was better if he did n't know anything , safer , wiser , and much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so bound and twisted in a cocoon of gauzy half-lies , warped truth , suggestions , all planted by Cathy , that she would not have known a true thing if it had come to her. 3Cathy grew more lovely all the time . The delicate blooming skin , the golden hair , the wide-set , modest , and yet promising eyes , the little mouth full of sweetness , caught attention and held it . She finEASTOF EDEN 79ished the eight grades of grammar school with such a good record that her parents entered her in the small high school , although in that time it was not usual for a girl to go on with her studies . But Cathy said she wanted to be a teacher , which delighted her mother and father , for this was the one profession of dignity open to a girl of a good but not well-to-do family . Parents took honor from a daughter who was a teacher . Cathy was fourteen when she entered high school . She had always been precious to her parents , but with her entrance into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where her parentscould not follow . They had lost her . They felt that she was translated to a higher order . The teacher of Latin was a pale intense young man who had failed in divinity school and yet had enough education to teach the inevitable grammar , Caesar , Cicero . He was a quiet young man who warmed his sense of failure to his bosom . Deep in himself he felt that he had been rejected by God , and for cause . For a time it was noticed that a flame leaped in James Grew and some force glowed in his eyes .. He was never seen with Cathy and no relationship was even suspected . James Grew became a man . He walked on his toes and sang to himself . He wrote letters so persuasive that the directors of his divinityschool looked favorably on readmitting him . And then the flame went out . His shoulders , held so high and square , folded dejectedly . His eyes grew feverish and his hands twitched . He was seen in church at night , on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and sent word that he was ill when it was known that he was walking all alone in the hills beyond the town . One night , late , he tapped on the door of the Ames house . Mr. Ames complained his way out of bed , lighted a candle , flung an overcoatover his nightgown , and went to the door . It was a wild and crazy-looking James Grew who stood before him , his eyes shining and his body one big shudder . " I 've got to see you , " he said hoarsely to Mr. Ames . " It 's after midnight , " Mr. Ames said sternly . " I 've got to see you alone . Put on some clothes and come outside . I 've got to talk to you . " " Young man , I think you 're drunk or sick . Go home and get some sleep . It 's after midnight . " 80 EAST OF EDEN " I ca n't wait . I 've got to talk to you . " " Come down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he closed the door firmly on the reeling caller and stood inside , listening . He heard the wailing voice , " I ca n't wait . I ca n't wait , " and then the feet dragged slowly down the steps . Mr. Ames shielded the candlelight away from his eyes with his cupped hand and went back to bed . He thought he saw Cathy 's door close very silently , but perhaps the leaping candlelight had fooled his eyes , for a portiere seemed to move too . " What in the world ? " his wife demanded when he came back to the bedside . Mr. Ames did n't know why he answered as he did  --  perhaps to save discussion . " A drunken man , " he said . " Got the wrong house . " " I do n't know what the world is coming to , " said Mrs. Ames . As he lay in the darkness after the light was out he saw the green circle left in his eyes by the candle flame , and in its whirling , pulsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grew . He did n't go back to sleep for a long time . In the morning a rumor ran through the town , distorted here and there , added to , but by afternoon the story clarified . The sexton had found James Grew stretched on the floor in front of the altar . The whole top of his head was blown off . Beside him lay a shotgun , and beside it the piece of stick with which he had pushed the trigger . Near him on the floor was a candlestick from the altar . One of the three candles was still burning . The other two had not been lighted . And on the floor were two books , the hymnal and the Book of Common Prayer , one on top of the other . The way the sexton figuredit , James Grew had propped the gun barrel on the books to bring it in line with his temple . The recoil of the discharge had thrown the shotgun off the books . A number of people remembered having heard an explosion early in the morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one could figure why he had done it . Mr. Ames ' first impulse was to go to the coroner with his story of the midnight call . Then he thought , What good would it do ? If I knew anything it would be different . But I do n't know a single thing . He had a sick feeling in his stomach . He told himself over and over that it was not his fault . How could I have helped it ? I do n't even know what he wanted . He felt guilty and miserable . At dinner his wife talked about the suicide and he could n't eat . EAST OF EDEN 81Cathy sat silent , but no more silent than usual . She ate with little dainty nips and wiped her mouth often on her napkin . Mrs. Ames went over the matter of the body and the gun in detail . " There 's one thing I meant to speak of , " she said . " That drunken man who came to the door last night  --  could that have been young Grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you sure ? Could you see him in the dark ? " " I had a candle , " he said sharply . " Did n't look anything like , had a big beard . " " No need to snap at me , " she said . " I just wondered . " Cathy wiped her mouth , and when she laid the napkin on her lap she was smiling . Mrs. Ames turned to her daughter . " You saw him every day in school , Cathy . Has he seemed sad lately ? Did you notice anything that might mean  --  " Cathy looked down at her plate and then up . " I thought he was sick , " she said . " Yes , he has looked bad . Everybody was talking in school today . And somebody  --  I do n't remember who  --  said that Mr. Grew was in some kind of trouble in Boston . I did n't hear what kind of trouble . We all liked Mr. Grew . " She wiped her lips delicately . That was Cathy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town knew that James Grew had been in trouble in Boston , and no one could possibly imagine that Cathy had planted the story . Even Mrs. Ames had forgotten where she heard it. 4Soon after her sixteenth birthday a change came over Cathy . One morning she did not get up for school . Her mother went into her room and found her in bed , staring at the ceiling . " Hurry , you 'll be late . It 's nearly nine . " " I 'm not going . " There was no emphasis in her voice . " Are you sick ? " " No . " " Then hurry , get up . " " I 'm not going . " " You must be sick . You 've never missed a day . " " I 'm not going to school , " Cathy said calmly . " I 'm never going to school again . " 82 EAST OF EDENHer mother 's mouth fell open . " What do you mean ? " " Not ever , " said Cathy and continued to stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what your father has to say about that ! With all our work and expense , and two years before you get your certificate ! " Then she came close and said softly , " You are n't thinking of getting married ? " " No . " " What 's that book you 're hiding ? " " Here ! I 'm not hiding it . " " Oh ! Alice in Wonderland . You 're too big for that . " Cathy said , " I can get to be so little you ca n't even see me . " " What in the world are you talking about ? " " Nobody can find me . " Her mother said angrily , " Stop making jokes . I do n't know what you 're thinking of . What does Miss Fancy think she is going to do ? " " I do n't know yet , " said Cathy . " I think I 'll go away . " " Well , you just lie there , Miss Fancy , and when your father comes home he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Cathy turned her head very slowly and looked at her mother . Her eyes were expressionless and cold . And suddenly Mrs. Ames was afraid of her daughter . She went out quietly and closed the door . In her kitchen she sat down and cupped her hands in her lap and stared out the window at the weathering carriage house . Her daughter had become a stranger to her . She felt , as most parentsdo at one time or another , that she was losing control , that the bridle put in her hands for the governing of Cathy was slipping through her fingers . She did not know that she had never had any power over Cathy . She had been used for Cathy 's purposes always . After a while Mrs. Ames put on a bonnet and went to the tannery . She wanted to talk to her husband away from the house . In the afternoon Cathy rose listlessly from her bed and spent a long time in front of the mirror . That evening Mr. Ames , hating what he had to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her duly , her obligation , her naturallove for her parents . Toward the end of his speech he was aware that she was not listening to him . This made him angry and he fell into threats . He spoke of the authority God had given him over his child and of how this natural authority had been armed by the state . He had her attention now . She looked him right in the eyes . Her mouth smiled a little , and her eyes did not seem to blink . EAST OF EDEN 83Finally he had to look away , and this enraged him further . He orderedher to stop her nonsense . Vaguely he threatened her with whippingif she did not obey him . He ended on a note of weakness . " I want you to promise me that you will go to school in the morning and stop your foolishness . " Her face was expressionless . The little mouth was straight . " All right , " she said . Later that night Mr. Ames said to his wife with an assurance he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little authority . Maybe we 've been too lax . But she has been a good child . I guess she just forgot who 's boss . A little sternness never hurt anybody . " He wished he were as confident as his words . In the morning she was gone . Her straw traveling basket was gone and the best of her clothing . Her bed was neatly made . The room was impersonal  --  nothing to indicate that a girl had grown up in it . There were no pictures , no mementos , none of the normal clutter of growing . Cathy had never played with dolls . The room had no Cathy imprint . In his way Mr. Ames was an intelligent man . He clapped on his derby hat and walked quickly to the railroad station . The station agent was certain . Cathy had taken the early morning train . She had bought a ticket for Boston . He helped Mr. Ames write a telegram to the Boston police . Mr. Ames bought a round-trip ticket and caught the nine-fifty train to Boston . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That night Mrs. Ames sat in the kitchen with the door closed . She was white and she gripped the table with her hands to control her shaking . The sound , first of the blows . and then of the screaming , came clearly to her through the closed doors . Mr. Ames was not good at whipping because he had never done it . He lashed at Cathy 's legs with the buggy whip , and when she stood quietly staring at him with calm cold eyes he lost his temper . The first blows were tentative and timid , but when she did not cry he slashed at her sides and shoulders . The whip licked and cut . In his rage he missed her several times or got too close so that the whip wrapped around her body . Cathy learned quickly . She found him out and knew him , and once she had learned she screamed , she writhed , she cried , she begged , and she had the satisfaction of feeling the blows instantly becomelighter . Mr. Ames was frightened at the noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cathy dropped back on the bed , sobbing . And if he had looked , her father would have seen that there were no tears in her eyes , but rather the muscles of her neck were tight and there were lumps just under her temples where the jaw muscle knotted . He said , " Now , will you ever do that again ? " " No , oh , no ! Forgive me , " Cathy said . She turned over on the bed so that her father could not see the coldness in her face . " See you remember who you are . And do n't forget what I am . " Cathy 's voice caught . She produced a dry sob . " I wo n't forget , " she said . In the kitchen Mrs. Ames wrestled her hands . Her husband put his fingers on her shoulder . " I hated to do it , " he said . " I had to . And I think it did her good . She seems like a changed girl to me . Maybe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rod . Maybe we were wrong . " And he knew that although his wife had insisted on the whipping , although she had forced him to whip Cathy , she hated him for doing it . Despair settled over him. 5There seemed no doubt that it was what Cathy needed . As Mr. Ames said , " It kind of opened her up . " She had always been tractable but now she became thoughtful too . In the weeks that followed she helped her mother in the kitchen and offered to help more than was needed . She started to knit an afghan for her mother , a large project that would take months . Mrs. Ames told the neighbors about it . " She has such a fine color sense  --  rust and yellow . She 's finished three squares already . " For her father Cathy kept a ready smile . She hung up his hat when he came in and turned his chair properly under the light to make it easy for him to read . Even in school she was changed . Always she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make plans for the future . She talked to the principal about examinations for her teaching certificate , perhaps a year early . And the principal looked over her record and thought she might well try it with hope of success . He called on Mr. Ames at the tannery to discuss it . " She did n't tell us any of this , " Mr. Ames said proudly . EAST OF EDEN $S " Well , maybe I should n't have told you . I hope I have n't ruined a surprise . " Mr. and Mrs. Ames felt that they had blundered on some magic which solved all of their problems . They put it down to an unconsciouswisdom which comes only to parents . " I never saw such a change in a person in my life , " Mr. Ames said . " But she was always a good child , " said his wife . " And have you noticed how pretty she 's getting ? Why , she 's almost beautiful . Her cheeks have so much color . " " I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mr. Ames . It was true that Cathy glowed . The childlike smile was constantly on her lips while she went about her preparations . She had all the time in the world . She cleaned the cellar and stuffed papers all around the edges of the foundation to block the draft . When the kitchen door squeaked she oiled the hinges and then the lock that turned too hard , and while she had the oil can out she oiled the front-door hinges too . She made it her duty to keep the lamps filled and their chimneys clean . She invented a way of dipping the chimneys in a big can of kerosene she had in the basement . " You 'd have to see it to believe it , " her father said . And it was n't only at home either . She braved the smell of the tannery to visit her father . She was just past sixteen and of course he thought of her as a baby . He was amazed at her questions about business . " She 's smarter than some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She might be running the business someday . " She was interested not only in the tanning processes but in the business end too . Her father explained the loans , the payments , the billing , and the payroll . He showed her how to open the safe and was pleased that after the first try she remembered the combination . " The way I look at it is this , " he told his wife . " We 've all of us got a little of the Old Nick in us . I would n't want a child that did n't have some gumption . The way I see it , that 's just a kind of energy . If you just check it and keep it in control , why , it will go in the right direction . " Cathy mended all of her clothes and put her things in order . One day in May she came home from school and went directly to her knitting needles . Her mother was dressed to go out . " I have to go86 EAST OF EDENto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's about the cake sale next week . I 'm chairman . Your father wondered if you would go by the bank and pick up the money for the payroll and take it to the tannery . I told ) him about the cake sale so I ca n't do it . " " I 'd like to , " said Cathy . " They 'll have the money ready for you in a bag , " said Mrs. Ames , and she hurried out . Cathy worked quickly but without hurry . She put on an old apron to cover her clothes . In the basement she found a jelly jar with a top and carried it out to the carriage house where the tools were kept . In the chickenyard she caught a little pullet , took it to the block and chopped its head off , and held the writhing neck over the jelly jar until it was half full of blood .. Then she carried the quivering pullet to the manure pile and buried it deep . Back in the kitchen she took off the apron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name sprang up on the cloth . She washed her hands and inspected her shoes and stockings and wiped a dark spot from the toe of her right shoe . She looked at her face in the mirror . Her cheeks were bright with color and her eyes shone and her mouth turned up in its small childlike smile . On her way out she hid the jelly jar under the lowest part of the kitchen steps . Her mother had not been gone even ten minutes . Cathy walked lightly , almost dancingly around the house and into the street . The trees were breaking into leaf and a few early dandelionswere in yellow flower on the lawns . Cathy walked gaily toward the center of the town where the bank was . And she was so fresh and pretty that people walking turned and looked after her when she had passed. 6The fire broke out at about three o'clock in the morning . It rose , flared , roared , crashed , and crumbled in on itself almost before anyonenoticed it . When the volunteers ran up , pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do but wet down the roofs of the neighboring houses to keep them from catching fire . The Ames house had gone up like a rocket . The volunteers and the ordinary audience fires attract looked around at the lighted faces , trying to see Mr. and Mrs. Ames and their daughter . It came to everyone at once that they were not there . People gazed at the broadEAST OF EDEN 97ember-bed and saw themselves and their children in there , and hearts rose up and pumped against throats . The volunteers began to dump water on the fire almost as though they might even so late save some corporeal part of the family . The frightened talk ran through the town that the whole Ames family had burned . By sunrise everyone in town was tight-packed about the smoking black pile . Those in front had to shield their faces against the heat . The volunteers continued to pump water to cool off the charred mess . By noon the coroner was able to throw wet planks down and probe with a crowbar among the sodden heaps of charcoal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure there were two bodies . Near neighbors pointed out the approximate place where Cathy'a room had been , but although the coroner and any number of helpers worked over the debris with a garden rake they could find no tooth or bone . The chief of the volunteers meanwhile had found the doorknobs and lock of the kitchen door . He looked at the blackened metal , puzzled , but not quite knowing what puzzled him . He borrowed the coroner 's rake and worked furiously . He went to the place where the front door had been and raked until he found that lock , crooked and half melted . By now he had his own small crowd , who demanded , " What are you looking for , George ? " And " What did you find , George ? " Finally the coroner came over to him . " What 's on your mind , George ? " " No keys in the locks , " the chief said uneasily . " Maybe they fell out . " " How ? " " Maybe they melted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe Bill Ames took them out . " " On the inside ? " He held up his trophies . Both bolts stuck out . Since the owner 's house was burned and the owner ostensiblyburned with it , the employees of the tannery , out of respect , did not go to work . They hung around the burned house , offering to help in any way they could , feeling official and generally getting in the way . It was n't until afternoon that Joel Robinson , the foreman , wentdown to the tannery . He found the safe open and papers scattered allover the floor . A broken window showed how the thief had entered . Now the whole complexion changed . So , it was not an accident. 88 EAST OF EDENFear took the place of excitement and sorrow , and anger , brother of fear , crept in . The crowd began to spread . They had not far to go . In the carriage house there was what is called " signs of a struggle "  --  in this case a broken box , a shattered carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the floor . The onlookers might not have known these as signs of a struggle had there not been a quantity of blood on the floor . The constable took control . This was his province . He pushed and herded everyone out of the carriage house . " Want to gum up all the clues ? " he shouted at them . " Now you all stay clear outside the door . " He searched the room , picked up something , and in a comer found something else . He came to the door , holding his discoveries in his hands  --  a blood-splattered blue hair ribbon and a cross with red stones . " Anybody recognize these here ? " he demanded . In a small town where everyone knows everyone it is almost impossible to believe that one of your acquaintance could murder anyone . For that reason , if the signs are not pretty strong in a particulardirection , it must be some dark stranger , some wanderer from the outside world where such things happen . Then the hobo camps are raided and vagrants brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not known is automatically suspected . It was May , remember , and the wandering men had only recently taken to the roads , now that the warming months let them spread their blankets by any water course . And the gypsies were out too  --  a whole caravan less than five miles away . And what a turning out those poor gypsies got ! The ground for miles around was searched for new-turned earth , and likely pools were dragged for Cathy 's body . " She was so pretty , " everyone said , and they meant that in themselves they could see a reason for carrying Cathy off . At length a bumbling hairy half-wit was brought in for questioning . He was a fine candidate for hanging because not only did he have no alibis , he could not remember what he had done at anytime in his life . His feeble mind sensed that these questioners wanted something of him and , being a friendly creature , he tried to give it to them . When a baited and set question was offered to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constablelooked happy . He tried manfully to please these superior beings . There was something very nice about him . The only trouble with his confession was that he confessed too much in too many diEASTOF EVEN 89rections . Also , he had constantly to be reminded of what he was supposed to have done . He was really pleased when he was indicted by a stern and frightened jury . He felt that at last he amounted to something . There were , and are , some men who become judges whose love for the law and for its intention of promoting justice has the quality of love for a woman . Such a man presided at the examination before plea  --  a man so pure and good that he canceled out a lot of wickednesswith his life . Without the prompting the culprit was used to , his confession was nonsense . The judge questioned him and found out that although the suspect was trying to follow instructions he simply could not remember what he did , whom he killed , how or why . The judge sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers at the constable . " Now look here , Mike , " he said , " you should n't do a thing like that . If that poor fellow had been just a little smarter you might have got him hanged . " " He said he did it . " The constable 's feelings were hurt because he was a conscientious man . " He would have admitted climbing the golden stairs and cutting St. Peter 's throat with a bowling ball , " the judge said . " Be more careful , Mike . The law was designed to save , not to destroy . " In all such local tragedies time works like a damp brush on water color . The sharp edges blur , the ache goes out of it , the colors melt together , and from the many separated lines a solid gray emerges . Within a month it was not so necessary to hang someone , and within two months nearly everybody discovered that there was n't any real evidence against anyone .

Cathy left a scent of sweetness behind her . Chapter 91Mr . Edwards carried on his business of whoremaster in an orderly and unemotional way . He maintained his wife and his two well-mannered children in a good house in a good neighborhood in Boston . The children , two boys , were entered on the books at Groton when they were infants . Mrs. Edwards kept a dustless house and controlled her servants . There were of course many times when Mr. Edwards had to be away from home on business , but he managed to live an amazingly domesticlife and to spend more evenings at home than you could imagine . He ran his business with a public accountant 's neatness and accuracy . He was a large and powerful man , running a little to fat in his late forties , and yet in surprisingly good condition for a time when a man wanted to be fat if only to prove he was a success . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small towns , the short stay of each girl , the discipline , the percentages . He felt his way along and made few mistakes . He never sent his girls into the cities . He could handle the hungry constables of the villages , but he had respect for the experienced and voracious big city police . His ideal stand was a small town with a mortgaged hotel and no amusements , one where his only competition came from wives and an occasional wayward girl . At this time he had ten units . Before he died at sixty-seven of strangulation on a chicken bone , he had groups of four girls in each of thirty-three small towns in New England . He was better than well fixed  --  he was rich ; and the manner of his death was in itself symbolic of success and well-being . At the present time the institution of the whorehouse seems to a certain extent to be dying out . Scholars have various reasons to give . Some say that the decay of morality among girls has dealt the whorehouse its deathblow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an increased scale is driving the houses out90EAST OF EDEN 91of existence . In the late days of the last century and the early part of this one , the whorehouse was an accepted if not openly discussed institution . It was said that its existence protected decent women . An unmarried man could go to one of these houses and evacuate the sexual energy which was making him uneasy and at the same time maintain the popular attitudes about the purity and loveliness of women . It was a mystery , but then there are many mysterious things in our social thinking . These houses ranged from palaces filled with gold and velvet to the crummiest cribs where the stench would drive a pig away . Every once in a while a story would start about how young girls were stolen and enslaved by the controllers of the industry , and perhaps many of the stories were true . But the great majority of whores drifted into their profession through laziness and stupidity . In the houses they had no responsibility . They were fed and clothed and taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were kicked out . This ending was no deterrent . No one who is young is ever going to be old . Now and then a smart girl came into the profession , but she usuallymoved up to better things . She got a house of her own or worked successfully at blackmail or married a rich man . There was even a special name for the smart ones . They were grandly called courtesans . Mr. Edwards had no trouble either in recruiting or in controlling his girls . If a girl was not properly stupid , he threw her out . He did not want very pretty girls either . Some local young man might fall in love with a pretty whore and there would be hell to pay . When any of his girls became pregnant they had the choice of leaving or of beingaborted so brutally that a fair proportion died . In spite of this the girls usually chose abortion . It was not always smooth sailing for Mr. Edwards . He did have his problems . At the time of which I am telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A train wreck had killed off two units of four girls each . Another of his units he lost to conversion when a small-town preacher suddenly caught fire and began igniting the townsfolk with his sermons . The swelling congregation had to move out of the church and into the fields . Then , as happens so often , the preacher turned over his hole-card , the sure-fire card . He predicted the date of the end of the world , and the whole county moved bleating in on him . Mr. Edwards went to the town , took the heavy quirt from his suitcase , and whipped the girls unmercifully ; 92 EAST OF EDENinstead of seeing the thing his way , the girls begged for more whipping to wipe out their fancied sins . He gave up in disgust , took their clothes , and went back to Boston . The girls achieved a certain prominence when they went naked to the camp meeting to confess and testify . That is how Mr. Edwards happened to be interviewingand recruiting numbers of girls instead of picking one up here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . I do n't know how Cathy Ames heard about Mr. Edwards . Perhaps a hack driver told her . The word got around when a girl really wanted to know . Mr. Edwards had not had a good morning when she came into his office . The pain in his stomach he ascribed to a halibut chowder his wife had given him for supper the night before . He had been up all night . The chowder had blown both ways and he still felt weak and crampy . For this reason he did not take in all at once the girl who called herself Catherine Amesbury . She was far too pretty for his business . Her voice was low and throaty , she was slight , almost delicate , and her skin was lovely . In a word she was not Mr. Edwards ' kind of girl at all . If he had not been weak he would have rejected her instantly . But while he did not look at her very closely during the routine questioning , mostly about relatives who might cause trouble , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Edwards was not a concupiscentman , and besides he never mixed his professional life with his private pleasures . His reaction startled him . He looked up , puzzled , at the girl , and her eyelids dipped sweetly and mysteriously , and there was just a suggestion of a sway on her lightly padded hips . Her little mouth wore a cat smile . Mr. Edwards leaned forward at his desk , breathing heavily . He realized that he wanted this one for his own . " I ca n't understand why a girl like you  --  " he began , and fell right into the oldest conviction in the world  --  that the girl you are in love with ca n't possibly be anything but true and honest . " My father is dead , " Catherine said modestly . " Before he died he had let things go to pieces . We did n't know he had borrowed money on the farm . And I ca n't let the bank take it away from my mother . The shock would kill her . " Catherine 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make enough to keep up the interest . " If ever Mr. Edwards had a chance it was now . And indeed a little warning buzz did sound in his brain , but it was not loud enough . About eighty per cent of the girls who came to him needed money to pay off a mortgage . And Mr. Edwards made it an unvarying ruleEAST OF EDEN 93not to believe anything his girls said at any time , beyond what they had for breakfast , and they sometimes lied about that . And here he was , a big , fat , grown-up whoremaster , leaning his stomach against his desk while his cheeks darkened with blood and excited chills ran up his legs and thighs . Mr. Edwards heard himself saying , " Well now , my dear , let 's talk this over . Maybe we can figure some way for you to get the interest money . " And this to a girl who had simply asked for a job as a whore  --  or had she ? 2Mrs . Edwards was persistently if not profoundly religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mechanics of her church , which did not leave her time for either its background or its effects . To her , Mr. Edwards was in the importing business , and even if she had known  --  which she probably did  --  what business he was really in , she would not have believed it . And this is another mystery . Her husband had always been to her a coldly thoughtful man who made few and dutifulphysical demands on her . If he had never been warm , he had never been cruel either . Her dramas and her emotions had to do with the boys , with the vestry , and with food . She was content with her life and thankful . When her husband 's disposition began to disintegrate , causing him to be restless and snappish , to sit staring and then to rush out of the house in a nervous rage , she ascribed it first to his stomach and then to business reverses . When by accident she came upon him in the bathroom , sitting on the toilet and crying softly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tried quickly to cover his red , brimming eyes from her scrutiny . When neither herb teas nor physics cured him she was helpless . If in all the years Mr. Edwards had heard about anyone like himselfhe would have laughed . For Mr. Edwards , as coldblooded a whoremaster as ever lived , had fallen hopelessly , miserably in love with Catherine Amesbury . He rented a sweet little brick house for her and then gave it to her . He bought her every imaginable luxury , overdecorated the house , kept it overwarm . The carpeting was too deep and the walls were crowded with heavy framed pictures . Mr. Edwards had never experienced such misery . As a matter of business he had learned so much about women that he did not trust one for a second . And since he deeply loved Catherine and love re-94 EAST OF EDENquires trust , he was torn to quivering fragments by his emotion . He had to trust her and at the same time he did not trust her . He tried to buy her loyalty with presents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tortured himself with the thought of other men slipping into her house . He hated to leave Boston to check up on his units because this would leave Catherine alone . To a certain extent he began to neglect his business . It was his first experience with this kind of love and it nearly killed him . One thing Mr. Edwards did not know , and could not know be- cause Catherine would not permit it , was that she was faithful to him in the sense that she did not receive or visit other men . To Catherine , Mr. Edwards was as cold a business proposition as his units were to him . And as he had his techniques , so had she hers . Once she had him , which was very soon , she managed always to seem slightly dis- satisfied . She gave him an impression of restlessness , as though she might take flight at any moment . When she knew he was going to visit her , she made it a point to be out and to come in glowing as from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficulties of avoiding the lecherous looks and touches of men in the street who could not keep away from her . Several times she ran frightened into the house , having barely escaped a man who had fol- lowed her . When she would return in the late afternoon and find him waiting for her she would explain , " Why , I was shopping . I have to go shopping , you know . " And she made it sound like a lie . In their sexual relations she convinced him that the result was not quite satisfactory to her , that if he were a better man he could release a flood of unbelievable reaction in her . Her method was to keep him continually off balance . She saw with satisfaction his nerves begin to go , his hands take to quivering , his loss of weight , and the wild glazed look in his eyes . And when she delicately sensed the near approach of insane , punishing rage , she sat in his lap and soothed him and made him believe for a moment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , and she set about getting it as quickly and as easily as she could . When she had successfully reduced him to a pulp , and Catherine knew exactly when the time had come , she began to steal from him . She went through his pockets and took any large bills site found . He did n't dare accuse her for fear she would go away . The presents of jewelry he gave her disappeared , and although she said she had lost them he knew they had been sold . She padded EAST OF EDEN 95the grocery bills , added to the prices of clothes . He could not bring himself to stop it . She did not sell the house but she mortgaged it for every penny she could get . One evening his key did not fit in the lock of the front door . She answered his pounding after a long time . Yes , she had changed the locks because she had lost her key . She was afraid , living alone . Anyonecould get in . She would get him another key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring the bell after that , and sometimes it took a long time for her to answer , and at other times his ring was not answered at all . There was no way for him to know whether she was at home or not . Mr. Edwards had her followed  --  and she did not know how often . Mr. Edwards was essentially a simple man , but even a simple man has complexities which are dark and twisted . Catherine was clever , but even a clever woman misses some of the strange corridors in a man . She made only one bad slip , and she had tried to avoid that one . As was proper , Mr. Edwards had stocked the pretty little nest with champagne . Catherine had from the first refused to touch it . " It makes me sick , " she explained . " I 've tried it and I ca n't drink it . " " Nonsense , " he said . " Just have one glass . It ca n't hurt you . " " No , thank you . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of her reluctance as a delicate , a ladylike quality . He had never insisted until one evening when it occurred to him that he knew nothing about her . Wine might loosen her tongue . The more he thought of it , the better the idea seemed to him . " It 's not friendly of you not to have a glass with me . " " I tell you , it does n't agree with me . " " Nonsense . " " I tell you I do n't want it . " " This is. silly , " he said . " Do you want me to be angry with you ? " " No . " " Then drink a glass . " " I do n't want it . " " Drink it . " He held a glass for her , and she retreated from it . " You do n't know . It 's not good for me . " " Drink it . " She took the glass and poured it down and stood still , quivering , seeming to listen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for herself and another . Her eyes became set and cold. 96 EAST OF EDENMr . Edwards felt a fear of her . Something was happening to her which neither she nor he could control . " I did n't want to do it . Remember that , " she said calmly . " Maybe you 'd better not have any more . " She laughed and poured herself another glass . " It does n't matter now , " she said . " More wo n't make much difference . " " It 's nice to have a glass or so , " he said uneasily . She spoke to him softly . " You fat slug , " she said . " What do you know about me ? Do you think I ca n't read every rotten thought you ever had ? Want me to tell you ? You wonder where a nice girl like me learned tricks . I 'll tell you . I learned them in cribs  --  you hear ?  --  cribs . I 've worked in places you never even heard of  --  four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know every nerve in your lousy body and I can use them . " " Catherine , " he protested , " you do n't know what you 're saying . " " I could see it . You thought I would talk . Well , I 'm talking . " She advanced slowly toward him , and Mr. Edwards overcame his impulse to edge away . He was afraid of her but he sat still . Directly in front of him she drank the last champagne in her glass , delicately struck the rim on the table , and jammed the ragged edge against his cheek . And then he did run from the house and he could hear her laughing as he went. 3Love to a man like Mr. Edwards is a crippling emotion . It ruined his judgment , canceled his knowledge , weakened him . He told himself that she was hysterical and tried to believe it , and it was made easier for him by Catherine . Her outbreak had terrified her , and for a time she made every effort to restore his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love is capable of self-torture beyond belief . Mr. Edwards wanted with all his heart to believe in her goodness , but he was forced not to , as much by his own particular devil as by her outbreak . Almost instinctively he went about learning the truth and at the same time disbelieved it . He knew , for instance , that she would not put her money in a bank . One of his employees , using a complicated set of mirrors , found out the place in the cellar of the little brick house where she did keep it . One day a clipping came from the agency he employed . It wasEAST OF EDEN 97an old newspaper account of a fire from a small-town weekly . Mr. Edwards studied it . His chest and stomach turned to molten metal and a redness glowed in his head behind his eyes . There was real fear mixed up in his love , and the precipitate from the mixing of these two is cruelty . He staggered dizzily to his office couch and lay face down , his forehead against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended , hardly breathing . Gradually his brain cleared . His mouth tasted salty , and there was a great ache of anger in his shoulders . But he was calm and his mind cut its intention through time like the sharp beam of a searchlight through a dark room . He moved slowly , checking his suitcase just as he always did when he started out to inspect his units  --  clean shirts and underwear , a nightgown and slippers , and the heavy quirt with the lash curving around the end of the suitcase . He moved heavily up the little garden in front of the brick house and rang the bell . Catherine answered it immediately . She had on her coat and hat . " Oh ! " she said . " What a shame ! I must go out for a while . " Mr. Edwards put down his suitcase . " No , " he said . She - studied him . Something was changed . He lumbered past her and went down into the cellar . " Where are you going ? " Her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment he came up again , carrying a small oak box . He opened his suitcase and put the box inside . " That 's mine , " she said softly . " I know . " " What are you up to ? " " I thought we 'd go for a little trip . " " Where ? I ca n't go . " " Little town in Connecticut . I have some business there . You told me once you wanted to work . You 're going to work . " " I do n't want to now . You ca n't make me . Why , I 'll call the police ! " He smiled so horribly that she stepped back from him . His temples were thudding with blood . " Maybe you 'd rather go to your home town , " he said . " They had a big fire there several years ago . Do you remember that fire ? " Her eyes probed and searched him , seeking a soft place , but his eyes were flat and hard . " What do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 98 EAST OF EDEN " Just come for a little trip with me . You said you wanted to work . " She could think of only one plan . She must go along with him and wait for a chance . A man could n't always watch . It would be dangerous to thwart him now  --  best go along with it and wait . That always worked . It always had . But his words had given Catherine real fear . In the small town they got off the train at dusk , walked down its one dark street , and on out into the country . Catherine was wary and watchful . She had no access to his plan . In her purse she had a thin-bladed knife . Mr. Edwards thought he knew what he intended to do . He meant to whip her and put her in one of the rooms at the inn , whip her and move her to another town , and so on until she was of no use any more . Then he would throw her out . The local constable would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The knife did not bother him . He knew about that . The first thing he did when they stopped in a private place between a stone wall and a fringe of cedars was to jerk the purse from her hand and throw it over the wall . That took care of the knife . But he did n't know about himself , because in all his life he had never been in love with a woman . He thought he only meant to punish her . After two slashes the quirt was not enough . He dropped it on the ground and used his fists . His breathing came out in squealing whines . Catherine did her best not to fall into panic . She tried to duck his threshing fists or at least to make them ineffective , but at last fear overcame her and she tried to run . He leaped at her and brought her down , and by then his fists were not enough . His frantic hand found a stone on the ground and his cold control was burst through with a red roaring wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He listened for her heartbeat and could hear nothing over the thumping of his own . Two complete and separate thoughts ran in his mind . One said , " Have to bury her , have to dig a hole and put her in it . " And the other cried like a child , " I ca n't stand it . 1 could n't bear to touch her . " Then the sickness that follows rage overwhelmed him . He ran from the place , leaving his suitcase , leaving the quirt , leaving the oak box of money . He blundered away in the dusk , wondering only where he could hide his sickness for a while . No question was ever asked of him . After a time of sickness to which his wife ministered tenderly , he went back to his business and never again let the insanity of love come near him . A man who can'tEAST OF EDEN 99learn from experience is a fool , he said . Always afterward he had a kind of fearful respect for himself . He had never known that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not killed Catherine was an accident . Every blow had been intended to crush her . She was a long time unconscious and a long time half-conscious . She realized her arm was broken and that she must find help if she wanted to live . Wanting to live forced her to drag herself along the dark road , looking for help . She turned in at a gate and almost made the steps of the house before she fainted . The roosters were crowing in the chickenhouse and a gray rim of dawn lay on the east . Chapter 101When two men live together they usually maintain a kind of shabby neatness out of incipient rage at each other . Two men alone are constantly on the verge of fighting , and they know it . Adam Trask had not been home long before the tensions began to build up . The brothers saw too much of each other and not enough of anyone else . For a few months they were busy getting Cyrus 's money in order and out at interest . They traveled together to Washington to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an iron star with seal and a hole on the top in which to insert the stick for a little flag on Decoration Day . The brothers stood by the grave a long time , then they went away and they did n't mention Cyrus . If Cyrus had been dishonest he had done it well . No one asked questions about the money . But the subject was on Charles ' mind . Back on the farm Adam asked him , " Why do n't you buy some new clothes ? You 're a rich man . You act like you 're afraid to spend a penny . " " I am , " said Charles . " Why ? " ? " I might have to give it back . " " Still harping on that ? If there was anything wrong , do n't you think we 'd have heard about it by now ? " " I do n't know , " said Charles . " 1 'd rather not talk about it . " But that night he brought up the subject again . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " About the money ? " " Yes , about the money . If you make that much money there 's bound to be a mess . " " How do you mean ? " " Well , papers and account books and bills of sale , notes , figuring  --  100EAST OF EDEN 101well , we went through Father 's things and there was n't none of that . " " Maybe he burned it up . " " Maybe he did , " said Charles . The brothers lived by a routine established by Charles , and he never varied it . Charles awakened on the stroke of four-thirty as surely as though the brass pendulum of the clock had nudged him . He was awake , in fact , a split second before four-thirty . His eyes were open and had blinked once before the high gong struck . For a moment he lay still , looking up into the darkness and scratching his stomach . Then he reached to the table beside his bed and his hand fell exactly on the block of sulphur matches lying there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side of the block . The sulphur burned its little blue bead before the wood caught . Charles lighted the candle beside his bed . He threw back his blanket and got up . He wore long gray underwear that bagged over his knees and hung loose around his ankles . Yawning , he went to the door , opened it , and called , " Half-past four , Adam . Time to get up . Wake up . " Adam 's voice was muffled . " Do n't you ever forget ? " " It 's time to get up . " Charles slipped his legs into his pants and hunched them up over his hips . " You do n't have to get up , " he said . " You 're a rich man . You can lay in bed all day . " " So are you . But we still get up before daylight . " " You do n't have to get up , " Charles repeated . " But if you 're going to farm , you 'd better farm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy more land so we can do more work . " " Come off it , " said Charles . " Go back to bed if you want to . " Adam said , " I bet you could n't sleep if you stayed in bed . You know what I bet ? I bet you get up because you want to , and then you take credit for it  --  like taking credit for six fingers . " Charles went into the kitchen and lighted the lamp . " You ca n't lay in bed and run a farm , " he said , and he knocked the ashes through the grate of the stove and tore some paper over the exposed coals and blew until the flame started . Adam was watching him through the door . " You would n't use a match , " he said . Charles turned angrily . " You mind your own goddam business . Stop picking at me . " " All right , " said Adam . " I will . And maybe my business is n't here . " 02 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any time you want to get out , you go right head . " The quarrel was silly but Adam could n't stop it . His voice went on without his willing it , making angry and irritating words . " You 're lamn right I 'll go when I want , " he said . " This is my place as much as ' ours . " " Then why do n't you do some work on it ? " " Oh , Lord ! " Adam said . " What are we fussing about ? Let 's not uss . " I do n't want trouble , " said Charles . He scooped lukewarm mush into two bowls and spun them on the table . The brothers sat down . Charles buttered a slice of bread , gouged ) ut a knifeful of jam , and spread it over the butter . He dug butter or his second slice and left a slop of jam on the butter roll . " Goddam it , ca n't you wipe your knife ? Look at that butter ! " Charles laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lands palm down on either side . " You better get off the place , " he aid . Adam got up . " I 'd rather live in a pigsty , " he said , and he walked ) ut of the house. 2It was eight months before Charles saw him again . Charles came n from work and found Adam sloshing water on his hair and face rom the kitchen bucket . " Hello , " said Charles . " How are you ? " " Fine , " said Adam . " Where 'd you go ? " " Boston . " " No place else ? " " No . Just looked at the city . " The brothers settled back to their old life , but each took precauionsagainst anger . In a way each protected the other and so saved timself . Charles , always the early riser , got breakfast ready before to awakened Adam . And Adam kept the house clean and started L set of books on the farm . In this guarded way they lived for two ears before their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a winter evening Adam looked up from his account book . " It 's nice in California , " he said . " It 's nice in the winter . And you can raise anything there . " " Sure you can raise it . But when you got it , what are you going to do with it ? " " How about wheat ? They raise a lot of wheat in California . " " The rust will get to it , " said Charles . " What makes you so sure ? Look , Charles , things grow so fast in California they say you have to plant and step back quick or you 'll get knocked down . " Charles said , " Why the hell do n't you go there ? I 'll buy you out any time you say . " Adam was quiet then , but in the morning while he combed his hair and peered in the small mirror he began it again . " They do n't have any winter in California , " he said . " It 's just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter , " said Charles . Adam came toward the stove . " Do n't be cross , " he said . " Well , stop picking at me . How many eggs ? " " Four , " said Adam . Charles placed seven eggs on top of the warming oven and built his fire carefully of small pieces of kindling until it burned fiercely . He put the skillet down next to the flame . His sullenness left him as he fried the bacon . " Adam , " he said , " I do n't know whether you notice it , but it seems like every other word you say is California . Do you really want togo ? " Adam chuckled . " That 's what I 'm trying to figure out , " he said . " I do n't know . It 's like getting up in the morning . I do n't want to get up but I do n't want to stay in bed either . " " You sure make a fuss about it , " said Charles . Adam went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would sound . And I swore to God if I ever got out I would sleep till noon every day . And here I get up a half-hour before reveille . Will you tell me , Charles , what in hell we 're working for ? " " You ca n't lay in bed and run a farm , " said Charles . He stirred the hissing bacon around with a fork . " Take a look at it , " Adam said earnestly . " Neither one of us has got a chick or a child , let alone a wife . And the way we 're going itEAST OF EDENt look like we ever will . We do n't have time to look around for a And here we 're figuring to add the Clark place to ours if the is right . What for ?

And that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the finest farm in this section . Two lonely old farts working tails off .

I 'm working too hard for what I 'm getting , and I do n't have ork at all . " Well , why do n't you quit ? " Charles shouted at him . " Why do n't get the hell out ?

Come in to the inn tonight and t cured up . " Vlaybe that 's it , " said Adam . " But I never took much satisfaction whore . " t 's all the same , " Charles said . " You shut your eyes and you t tell the difference . " Some of the boys in the regiment used to keep a squaw around . I one for a while . " harles turned to him with interest . " Father would turn in his ' e if he knew you was squawing around . How was it ? " EAST OF EDEN 105 " Pretty nice . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooking . " " I mean the other  --  how was that ?

She was sweet . " " You 've got a funny look in your eye . I guess you were kind of gone on that squaw . " " I guess I was , " said Adam . " What happened to her ? " " Smallpox . " " You did n't get another one ? " Adam 's eyes were pained . " We piled them up like they were logs , over two hundred , arms and legs sticking out . And we piled brush on top and poured coal oil on . " " I 've heard they ca n't stand smallpox . " " It kills them , " said Adam . " You 're burning that bacon . " Charles turned quickly back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " I like it crisp . " He shoveled the bacon out on a plate and broke the eggs in the hot grease and they jumped and fluttered their edges to brown lace and made clucking sounds . " There was a schoolteacher , " Charles said . " Prettiest thing you ever saw . Had little tiny feet . Bought all her clothes in New York . Yellow hair , and you never saw such little feet , Sang too , in the choir . Everybody took to going to church . Damn near stampeded getting into church . That was quite a while ago . " " ' Bout the time you wrote about thinking of getting married ? " Charles grinned . " I guess so . I guess there was n't a young buck in the county did n't get the marrying fever . " " What happened to her ? " " Well , you know how it is . The women got kind of restless with her here . They got together . First thing you knew they had her out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toity . School board had her out halfway through the term . Feet no longer than that . Showed her ankles too , like it was an accident . Always showing her ankles . " " Did you get to know her ? " Adam asked . " No . I only went to church . Could n't hardly get in . Girl that106 EAST OF EDENpretty 's got no right in a little town . Just makes people uneasy . Causes trouble . " Adam said , " Remember that Samuels girl ? She was real pretty . What happened to her ? " " Same thing . Just caused trouble . She went away . I heard she 's living in Philadelphia . Does dressmaking . I heard she gets ten dollars just for making one dress . " " Maybe we ought to go away from here , " Adam said . Charles said , " Still thinking of California ? " " I guess so . " Charles ' temper tore in two . " I want you out of here ! " he shouted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll buy you or sell you or anything . Get out , you son of a bitch  --  " He stopped . " I guess I do n't mean that last . But goddam it , you make me nervous . " " I 'll go , " said Adam. 3In three months Charles got a colored picture postcard of the bay at Rio , and Adam had written on the back with a splottery pen , " It 's summer here when it 's winter there . Why do n't you come down ? " Six months later there was another card , from Buenos Aires . " Dear Charles  --  my God this is a big city . They speak French and Spanish both . I 'm sending you a book . " But no book came . Charles looked for it all the following winter and well into the spring . And instead of the book Adam arrived . He was brown and his clothes had a foreign look . " How are you ? " Charles asked . " Fine . Did you get the book ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it ? It had pictures . " " Going to stay ? " " I guess so . I 'll tell you about that country . " " I do n't want to hear about it , " said Charles . " Christ , you 're mean , " said Adam . " I can just see it all over again . You 'll stay around a year or so and then you 'll get restless and you 'll make me restless . We 'll get mad at each other and then we 'll get polite to each other  --  and that 's worse . Then we 'll blow up and you 'll go away again , and then you 'll come back and we 'll do it all over again . " EAST OF EDEN 1e- . Adam asked , " Do n't you want me to stay ? " " Hell , yes , " said Charles . " I miss you when you 're not here . But I can see how it 's going to be just the same . " And it was just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foil a while they recounted the times when they were apart , and finally they relapsed into the long ugly silences , the hours of speechless work , the guarded courtesy , the flashes of anger . There were no boundarie to time so that it seemed endless passing . On an evening Adam said , " You know , I 'm going to be thirty-seven .. That 's half a life . " " Here it comes , " said Charles . " Wasting your life . Look , Adam , could we not have a fight this time ? " " How do you mean ? " " Well , if we run true to form we 'll fight for three or four weeks , getting you ready to go away . If you 're getting restless , could n't you just go away and save all the trouble ? " Adam laughed and the tension went out of the room . " I 've got a pretty smart brother . " he said . " Sure , when I get the itch bad enough I 'll go without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting rich , are n't you , Charles ? " " I 'm doing all right . I would n't say rich .

Why do n't we build a new house  --  bathtub anc running water and a water closet ? We 're not poor people any more , Why , they say you 're nearly the richest man in this section . " " We do n't need a new house , " Charles said gruffly . " You take your fancy ideas away . " " It would be nice to go to the toilet without going outside . " " You take your fancy ideas away .

" Charles said slowly , " I 've thought about it a lot . And I 've wanted for you to bring it up . I guess you are n't ever going to . " " What do you mean ? " " You remember when you sent me a telegram for a hundred dollars ? " " You bet I do . Saved my life , I guess . Why ? " " You never paid it back . " " I must have . " " You did n't . " Adam looked down at the old table where Cyrus had sat , knocking on his wooden leg with a stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of the table , shedding its unstable yellow light from the round Rochester wick . Adam said slowly , " I 'll pay you in the morning . " " I gave you plenty of time to offer . " " Sure you did , Charles . I should have remembered .

I broke jail  --  I escaped . " Charles ' mouth was open . " What are you talking about ? " " I 'm going to tell you . I was a tramp and I got taken up for vagrancyand put on a road gang  --  leg irons at night . Got out in six months and picked right up again . That 's how they get their roads built .

" I do n't know why I mentioned it . " " Good God , no . I 'll pay you in the morning . " " I 'll be damned , " said Charles . " My brother a jailbird ! " " You do n't have to look so happy . " " I do n't know why , " said Charles , " but it makes me kind of proud . EAST OF EDEN 109My brother a jailbird ! Tell me this , Adam  --  why did you wait till just three days before they let you go to make your break ? " Adam smiled . " Two or three reasons , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , why , they 'd pick me up again . And I figured if I waited till the end they would n't expect me to run away . " " That makes sense , " said Charles . " But you said there was one more reason . " " I guess the other was the most important , " Adam said , " and it 's the hardest to explain . I figured I owed the state six months . That was the sentence . I did n't feel right about cheating . I only cheated three days . " Charles exploded with laughter . " You 're a crazy son of a bitch , " he said with affection . " But you say you robbed a store . " " I sent the money back with ten per cent interest , " Adam said . Charles leaned forward . " Tell me about the road gang , Adam . " " Sure I will , Charles . Sure I will . " Chapter 111Charles had more respect for Adam after he knew about the prison . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one who is not perfect and therefore no target for your hatred . Adam took some advantage of it too . He tempted Charles . " Did you ever think , Charles , that we 've got enough money to do anything we want to do ? " " All right , what do we want ? " " We could go to Europe , we could walk around Paris . " " What 's that ? " " What 's what ? " " I thought I heard someone on the stoop . " " Probably a cat . " " I guess so . Have to kill off some of them pretty soon . " " Charles , we could go to Egypt and walk around the Sphinx . " " We could stay right here and make some good use of our money . And we could get the hell out to work and make some use of the day . Those goddam cats ! " Charles jumped to the door and yanked it open and said , " Get ! " Then he was silent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved beside him . A dirty bundle of rags and mud was trying to worm its way up the steps . One skinny hand clawed slowly at the stairs . The other dragged helplessly . There was a caked face with cracked lips and eyes peering out of swollen , blackened lids . The forehead was laid open , oozing blood back into the matted hair . Adam went down the stairs and kneeled beside the figure . " Give me a hand , " he said . " Come on , let 's get her in . Here  --  look out for that arm . It looks broken . " She fainted when they carried herItoEAST OF EDEN Ill " Put her in my bed , " Adam said . " Now I think you better go for the doctor . " " Do n't you think we better hitch up and take her in ? " " Move her ? No . Are you crazy ? " " Maybe not as crazy as you . Think about it a minute . " " For God 's sake , think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've got this in their house . " Adam was shocked . " You do n't mean it . " " I mean it all right . I think we better take her in . It 'll be all over the county in two hours . How do you know what she is ? How 'd she get here ? What happened to her ? Adam , you 're taking an awful chance . " Adam said coldly , " If you do n't go now , I 'll go and leave you here . " " I think you 're making a mistake . I 'll go , but I tell you we 'll suffer for it . " " I 'll do the suffering , " said Adam . " You go . " After Charles left , Adam went to the kitchen and poured hot water from the teakettle into a basin . In his bedroom he dampened a handkerchief in the water and loosened the caked blood and dirt on the girl 's face . She reeled up to consciousness and her blue eyes glinted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , this bed . His stepmother was standing over him with a damp cloth in her hand , and he could feel the little running pains as the water cut through . And she had said something over and over . He heard it but he could not remember what it was . " You 'll be all right , " he said to the girl . " We 're getting a doctor . He 'll be here right off . " Her lips moved a little . " Do n't try to talk , " he said . " Do n't try to say anything . " As he worked gently with his cloth a huge warmth crept over him . " You can stay here , " he said . " You can stay here as long as you want . I 'll take care of you . " He squeezed out the cloth and sponged her matted hair and lifted it out of the gashes in her scalp . He could hear himself talking as he worked , almost as though he were a stranger listening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I 'll put some brown paper over your eyes . You 'll be all right . That 's a bad one on your forehead . I 'm afraid you 'll have a scar there . Could you tell me your name ? No , do n't try . There 's lots of time . There 's lots of time . Do you hear that ? That 's the doctor 's rig . Was n't that112 EAST OF EDENquick ? " He moved to the kitchen door . " In here , Doc . She 's in here , " he called. 2She was very badly hurt . If there had been X-rays in that time the doctor might have found more injuries than he did . As it was he found enough . Her left arm and three ribs were broken and her jaw was cracked . Her skull was cracked too , and the teeth on the left side were missing . Her scalp was ripped and torn and her forehead laid open to the skull . So much the doctor could see and identify . He set her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalp . With a pipette and an alcohol flame he bent a glass tube to go through the aperture where a tooth was missing so that she could drink and take liquid food without moving her cracked jaw . He gave her a large shot of morphine , left a bottle of opium pills , washed his hands , and put on his coat . His patient was asleep before he left the room . In the kitchen he sat down at the table and drank the hot coffee Charles put in front of him . " All right , what happened to her ? " he asked . " How do we know ? " Charles said truculently . " We found her on our porch . If you want to see , go look at the marks on the road where she dragged herself . " " Know who she is ? " " God , no . " " You go upstairs at the inn  --  is she anybody from there ? " " I have n't been there lately . I could n't recognize her in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You ever see her be-fore ? " Adam shook his head slowly . Charles said harshly , " Say , what you mousing around at ? " " I 'll tell you , since you 're interested . That girl did n't fall under a harrow even if she looks that way . Somebody did that to her , somebody who did n't like her at all . If you want the truth , somebody tried to kill her . " " Why do n't you ask her ? " Charles said . " She wo n't be talking for quite a while . Besides , her skull is cracked , and God knows what that will do to her . What I 'm getting at is , should I bring the sheriff into it ? " EAST OF EDEN 113 " No ! " Adam spoke so explosively that the two looked at him . " Let her alone . Let her rest .

" " Well , I 'll go if she has to go . " The doctor said , " Steady down . What makes you so interested ? " " I would n't put a hurt dog out . " " You would n't get mad about it either . Are you holding something back ? Did you go out last night ? Did you do it ? " " He was here all night , " said Charles . " He snores like a goddamtrain . " Adam said , " Why ca n't you let her be ? Let her get well . " The doctor stood up and dusted his hands . " Adam , " he said , " your father was one of my oldest friends . I know you and your family . You are n't stupid . I do n't know why you do n't recognize ordinary facts , but you do n't seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That girl was assaulted . I believe whoever did it tried to kill her .

" " It 's not my habit to let my patients be bothered , " the doctor said . " You still want to keep her here ? " " Yes . " " Your funeral . I 'll look in tomorrow . She 'll sleep . Give her water and warm soup through the tube if she wants it . " He stalked out . Charles turned on his brother . " Adam , for God 's sake , what is this ? " " Let me alone . " " What 's got into you ? " " Let me alone  --  you hear ? Just let me alone . " " Christ ! " said Charles and spat on the floor and went restlessly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He moved about the kitchen , washed the breakfast dishes , and swept the floor . When he had put the kitchen to rights he went in and drew a chair up to the bed . The girl114 EAST OF EDENsnored thickly through the morphine . The swelling was going down on her face but the eyes were blackened and swollen . Adam sat very still , looking at her . Her set and splinted arm lay on her stomach , but her right arm lay on top of the coverlet , the fingers curled like a nest . It was a child 's hand , almost a baby 's hand . Adam touched her wrist with his finger , and her fingers moved a little in reflex . Her wrist was warm . Secretly then , as though he were afraid he might be caught , he straightened her hand and touched the little cushion pads on the fingertips . Her fingers were pink and soft , but the skin on the back of her hand seemed to have an underbloom like a pearl . Adam chuckled with delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her throat clicked and the rhythmed snoring continued . Gently he worked her hand and arm under the cover before he tiptoed out of the room . For several days Cathy lay in a cave of shock and opium . Her skin felt like lead , and she moved very little because of the pain . She was aware of movement around her . Gradually her head and her eyes cleared . Two young men were with her , one occasionally and the other a great deal . She knew that another man who came in was the doctor , and there was also a tall lean man , who interested her more than any of the others , and the interest grew out of fear . Perhapsin her drugged sleep she had picked something up and stored it . Very slowly her mind assembled the last days and rearranged them . She saw the face of Mr. Edwards , saw it lose its placid self-sufficiency and dissolve into murder . She had never been so afraid before in her life , but she had learned fear now . And her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Edwards knew about the fire . Did anyone else ? And how did he know ? A blind nauseating terror rose in her when she thought of that . From things she heard she learned that the tall man was the sheriff and wanted to question her , and that the young man named Adam was protecting her from the questioning . Maybe the sheriff knew about the fire . Raised voices gave her the cue to her method . The sheriff said , " She must have a name . Somebody must know her . " " How could she answer ? Her jaw is broken . " Adam 's voice . " If she 's right-handed she could spell out answers . Look here , Adam , if somebody tried to kill her I 'd better catch him while I can . Just give me a pencil and let me talk to her . " EAST OF EDEN 115Adam said , " You heard the doctor say her skull was cracked . 1-low do you know she can remember ? " " Well , you give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want you to bother her . " " Adam , goddam it , it does n't matter what you want . I 'm telling you I want a paper and pencil . " Then the other young man 's voice . " What 's the matter with you ? You make it sound like it was you who did it . Give him a pencil . " She had her eyes closed when the three men came quietly into her room . " She 's asleep , " Adam whispered . She opened her eyes and looked at them . The tall man came to the side of the bed . " I do n't want to bother you , Miss . I 'm the sheriff . I know you ca n't talk , but will you just write some things on this ? " She tried to nod and winced with pain . She blinked her eyes rapidlyto indicate assent . " That 's the girl , " said the sheriff . " You see ? She wants to . " He put the tablet on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There we are . Now .

" Here , now there 's a fresh sheet . What do you remember ? " " All black . Ca n't think , " the pencil wrote before it went over the edge of the tablet . " Do n't you remember who you are , where you came from ? Think ! " She seemed to go through a great struggle and then her face gave up and became tragic . " No . Mixed up . Help me . " " Poor child , " the sheriff said . " I thank you for trying anyway . When you get better we 'll try again . No , you do n't have to write any more . " The pencil wrote , " Thank you , " and fell from her fingers . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only Charles was against her . When the brothers were in her room , and it took two of them to help her on the bedpan without hurting her , she studied Charles ' dark sullenness . He had something in his face that she recognized , that made her uneasy . She saw that he touched the116 EAST OF EDENscar on his forehead very often , rubbed it , and drew its outline with his fingers . Once he caught her watching . He looked guiltily at his fingers . Charles said brutally , " Do n't you worry . You 're going to have one like it , maybe even a better one . " She smiled at him , and he looked away . When Adam came in with her warm soup Charles said , " I 'm going in town and drink some beer . " 3Adam could n't remember ever having been so happy . It did n't bother him that he did not know her name . She had said to call her Cathy , and that was enough for him . He cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his stepmother . Cathy 's vitality was great . She began to recover very quickly . The swelling went out of her cheeks and the prettiness of convalescence came to her face . In a short time she could be helped to a sitting position . She opened and closed her mouth very carefully , and she began to eat soft foods that required little chewing . The bandage was still on her forehead but the rest of her face was little marked except for the hollow cheek on the side where the teeth were missing . Cathy was in trouble and her mind ranged for a way out of it . She spoke little even when it was not so difficult . One afternoon she heard someone moving around in the kitchen . She called , " Adam , is it you ? " Charles ' voice answered , " No , it 's me . " " Would you come in here just for a minute , please ? " He stood in the doorway . His eyes were sullen . " You do n't come in much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You do n't like me . " " I guess that 's right too . " " Will you tell me why ? " He struggled to find an answer . " I do n't trust you . " " Why not ? " " I do n't know . And I do n't believe you lost your memory . " " But why should I lie ? " " I do n't know . That 's why I do n't trust you . There 's something-  --   - -  I almost reccgnize . " EAST OF EDEN 117 " You never saw me in your life . " " Maybe not . But there 's something that bothers me  --  that I ought to know . And how do you know I never saw you ? " She was silent , and he moved to leave . " Do n't go , " she said . " What do you intend to do ? " " About what ? " " About me . " He regarded her with a new interest . " You want the truth ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , but I 'll tell you . I 'm going to get you out of here just as soon as I can . My brother 's turned fool , but I 'll bring him around if I have to lick him . " " Could you do that ? He 's a big man . " " I could do it . " She regarded him levelly . " Where is Adam ? " " Gone in town to get some more of your goddam medicine . " " You 're a mean man . " " You know what I think ? I do n't think I 'm half as mean as you are under that nice skin . I think you 're a devil . " She laughed softly . " That makes two of us , " she said . " Charles , how long do I have ? " " For what ? " " How long before you put me out ? Tell me truly . " " All right , I will . About a week or ten days . Soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go . " He regarded her craftily , almost with pleasure at the thought of combat . " All right , I 'll tell you . When you had all that dope you talked a lot , like in your sleep . " " I do n't believe that . " He laughed , for he had seen the quick tightening of her mouth . " All right , do n't . And if you just go about your business as soon as you can , I wo n't tell . But if you do n't , you 'll know all right , and so will the sheriff . " " I do n't believe I said anything bad . What could I say ? " " I wo n't argue with you . And I 've got work to do . You asked me and I told you . " He went outside . Back of the henhouse he leaned over and laughed and slapped his leg . " I thought she was smarter , " he said to himself . And he felt more easy than he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if he had recognized her , so ad she recognized him . He was the only person she had ever met , who played it her way . Cathy followed his thinking , and it did not reassure her . She knew that her tricks would not work with him , and she needed protection and rest . Her money was gone . She had to be sheltered , and would have to be for a long time . She was tired and sick , but her mind went skipping among possibilities . Adam came back from ' town with a bottle of Pain Killer . He poured a tablespoonful . " This will taste horrible , " he said . " It 's good stuff though . " She took it without protest , did not even make much of a face about it . " You 're good to me , " she said . " I wonder why ? I 've brought you trouble . " " You have not . You 've brightened up the whole house . Never complain or anything , hurt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , so kind . " " I want to be . " " Do you have to go out ? Could n't you stay and talk to me ? " " Sure I could . There 's nothing so important to do . " " Draw up a chair , Adam , and sit down . " When he was seated she stretched her right hand toward him , and he took it in both of his . " So good and kind , " she repeated . " Adam , you keep promises , do n't you ? " " I try to . What are you thinking about ? " " I 'm alone and I 'm afraid , " she cried . " I 'm afraid . " " Ca n't I help you ? " " I do n't think anyone can help me . " " Tell me and let me try . " " That 's the worst part . I ca n't even tell you . " " Why not ? If it 's a secret I wo n't tell it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ? " " No , I do n't . " Her fingers gripped his hand tightly . " Adam , I did n't ever lose my memory . " " Then why did you say  --  " " That 's what I 'm trying to tell you . Did you love your father , Adam ? " EAST OF EDEN 119 " I guess I revered him more than loved him . " " Well , if someone you revered were in trouble , would n't you do anything to save him from destruction ? " " Well , sure . I guess I would . " " Well , that 's how it is with me . " " But how did you get hurt ? " " That 's part of it . That 's why I ca n't tell . " " Was it your father ? " " Oh , no . But it 's all tied up together . " " You mean , if you tell me who hurt you , then your father will be in trouble ? " She sighed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you trust me ? " " Of course . " " It 's an awful thing to ask . " " No , it is n't , not if you 're protecting your father . " " You understand , it 's not my secret . If it were I 'd tell you in a minute . " " Of course I understand . I 'd do the same thing myself . " " Oh , you understand so much . " Tears welled up in her eyes . He leaned down toward her , and she kissed him on the cheek . " Do n't you worry , " he said , " I 'll take care of you . " She lay back against the pillow . " I do n't think you can . " " What do you mean ? " " Well , your brother does n't like me . He wants me to get out of here . " " Did he tell you that ? " " Oh , no . I can just feel it . He has n't your understanding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that , but he does n't have your kindness . And when I have to go  --  the sheriff is going to begin asking questions and I 'll be all alone . " He stared into space . " My brother ca n't make you go . I own half of this farm . I have my own money . " " If he wanted me to go I would have to . I ca n't spoil your life . " Adam stood up and strode out of the room . He went to the back door and looked out on the afternoon . Far off in the field his brother was lifting stones from a sled and piling them on the stone wall . Adam looked up at the sky . A blanket of herring clouds was rolling in from the east . He sighed deeply and his breath made a tickling , 120 EAST OF EDENexciting feeling in his chest . His ears seemed suddenly clear , so that he heard the chickens cackling and the east wind blowing over the ground . He heard horses ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a neighbor was shingling a barn . And all these sounds related into a kind of music . His eyes were clear too . Fences and walls and sheds stood staunchly out in the yellow afternoon , and they were related too . There was change in everything . A flight of sparrows dropped into the dust and scrabbled for bits of food and then flew off like a gray scarf twisting in the light . Adam looked back at his brother . He had lost track of time and he did not know how long he had been standing in the doorway . No time had passed . Charles was still struggling with the same large stone . And Adam had not released the full , held breath he had taken when time stopped . Suddenly he knew joy and sorrow felted into one fabric . Courage and fear were one thing too . He found that he had started to hum a droning little tune . He turned , walked through the kitchen , and stood in the doorway , looking at Cathy . She smiled weakly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What a helpless child ! and a surge of love filled him . " Will you marry me ? " he asked . Her face tightened and her hand closed convulsively . " You do n't have to tell me now , " he said . " I want you to think about it . But if you would marry me I could protect you . No one could hurt you again . " Cathy recovered in an instant . " Come here , Adam . There , sit down . Here , give me your hand . That 's good , that 's right . " She raised his hand and put the back of it against her cheek . " My dear , " she said brokenly . " Oh , my dear . Look , Adam , you have trusted me . Now will you promise me something ? Will you promise not to tell your brother you have asked me ? " " Asked you to marry me ? Why should n't I ? " " It 's not that . I want this night to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could you let me do that ? " She raised her hand to her head . " You know I 'm not sure I can think straight . And I want to . " " Do you think you might marry me ? " " Please , Adam . Let me alone to think . Please , my dear . " He smiled and said nervously , " Do n't make it long . I 'm kind of like a cat up a tree so far he ca n't come down . " EAST OF EDEN 121 " Just let me think . And , Adam  --  you 're a kind man . " He went outside and walked toward where his brother was loading stones . When he was gone Cathy got up from her bed and moved unsteadilyto the bureau . She leaned forward and looked at her face . The bandage was still on her forehead . She raised the edge of it enough to see the angry red underneath . She had not only made up her mind to marry Adam but she had so decided before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed protection and money . Adam could give her both . And she could control him  --  she knew that . She did not want to be married , but for the time being it was a refuge . Only one thing bothered her . Adam had a warmth toward her which she did not understand since she had none toward him , nor had ever experienced it toward anyone . And Mr. Edwards had really frightenedher . That had been the only time in her life she had lost control of a situation . She determined never to let it happen again . She smiled to herself when she thought what Charles would say . She felt a kinship to Charles . She did n't mind his suspicion of her. 5Charles straightened up when Adam approached . He put his palms against the small of his back and massaged the tired muscles . " My God , there 's lots of rocks , " he said . " Fellow in the army told me there 's valleys in California  --  miles and miles  --  and you ca n't find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 'll be something else , " said Charles . " I do n't think there 's any farm without something wrong with it . Out in the Middle West it 's locusts , someplace else it 's tornadoes . What 's a few stones ? " " I guess you 're right . I thought I would give you a hand . " " That 's nice of you . I thought you 'd spend the rest of your life holding hands with that in there . How long is she going to stay ? " Adam was on the point of telling him of his proposal but the tone of Charles ' voice made him change his mind . " Say , " Charles said , " Alex Platt came by a little while ago . You 'd never think what happened to him . He 's found a fortune . " " How do you mean ? " " Well , you know the place on his property where that clump of cedars sticks out  --  you know , right on the county road ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EDEN " Alex went in between those trees and his stone wall . He wi 's hunting rabbits . He found a suitcase and a man 's clothes , all packed nice . Soaked up with rain though . Looked like it had been there some time . And there was a wooden box with a lock , and when he broke it open there was near four thousand dollars in it . And he found a purse too . There was n't anything in it . " " No name or anything ? " " That 's the strange part  --  no name ; no name on the clothes , no labels on the suits . It 's just like the fellow did n't want to be traced . " " Is Alex going to keep it ? " " He took it in to the sheriff , and the sheriff is going to advertise it , and if nobody answers Alex can keep it . " " Somebody 's sure to claim it . " " I guess so . I did n't tell Alex that . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no labels  --  not cut out , just did n't have any . " " That 's a lot of money , " Adam said . " Somebody 's bound to claim it . " Alex hung around for a while . You know , his wife goes around a lot . " Charles was silent . " Adam , " he said finally , " we got to have a talk . The whole county 's doing plenty of talking . " " What about ? What do you mean ? " " Goddam it , about that  --  that girl . Two men ca n't have a girl living with them . Alex says the women are pretty riled up about it . Adam , we ca n't have it . We live here . We 've got a good name . " " You want me to throw her out before she 's well ? " " I want you to get rid of her  --  get her out . I do n't like her . " " You never have . " " I know it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something  --  I do n't know what it is , but I do n't like it . When you going to get her out ? " " Tell you what , " Adam said slowly . " Give her one more week and then I 'll do something about her . " " You promise ? " " Sure I promise . " " Well , that 's something . I 'll get the word to Alex 's wife . From there on she 'll handle the news . Good Lord , I 'll be glad to have the house to ourselves again . I do n't suppose her memory 's come back ? " " No , " said Adam . EAST OF EDEN 1236Five days later , when Charles had gone to buy some calf feed , Adam drove the buggy to the kitchen steps . He helped Cathy in , tucked a blanket around her knees , and put another around her shoulders . He drove to the county seat and was married to her by a justice of the peace . Charles was home when they returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen . " I thought you 'd took her in to put her on the train . " " We got married , " Adam said simply . Cathy smiled at Charles . " Why ? Why did you do it ? " " Why not ? Ca n't a man get married ? " Cathy went quickly into the bedroom and closed the door . Charles began to rave . " She 's no damn good , I tell you . She 's a whore . " " Charles ! " " I tell you , she 's just a two-bit whore . I would n't trust her with a bit piece  --  why , that bitch , that slut ! " " Charles , stop it ! Stop it , I tell you ! You keep your filthy mouth shut about my wife ! " " She 's no more a wife than an alley cat . " Adam said slowly , " I think you 're jealous , Charles . I think you wanted to marry her . " " Why , you goddam fool ! Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her ! " Adam said evenly , " You wo n't have to . I 'm going away . You can buy me out if you want . You can have the farm . You always wanted it . You can stay here and rot . " Charles ' voice lowered . " Wo n't you get rid of her ? Please , Adam . Throw her out . She 'll tear you to pieces . She 'll destroy you , Adam , she 'll destroy you ! " " How do you know so much about her ? " Charles ' eyes were bleak . " I do n't , " he said , and his mouth snapped shut . Adam did not even ask Cathy whether she wanted to come out for dinner . He carried two plates into the bedroom and sat beside her . " We 're going to go away . " he said. 124 EAST OF EDEN " Let me go away . Please , let me . I do n't want to make you hate your brother . I wonder why he hates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her eyes narrowed . " Jealous ? " " That 's what it looks like to me . You do n't have to worry . We 're getting out . We 're going to California . " She said quietly , " I do n't want to go to California . " " Nonsense . Why , it 's nice there , sun all the time and beautiful . " " I do n't want to go to California . " " You are my wife , " he said softly . " I want you to go with me . " She was silent and did not speak of it again . They heard Charles slam out the door , and Adam said , " That will be good for him . He 'll get a little drunk and he 'll feel better .

" " Why , sure , I 'd like some myself . " He brought the steaming cupsin and went back for the sugar bowl . He settled himself in a chairnear her bed . " It 's pretty strong . Is it too strong for you ? " " I like it strong . " He finished his cup . " Does it taste strange to you ? It 's got a funny taste . " Her hand flew to her mouth . " Oh , let me taste it .

PART TWOChapter 12You can see how this book has reached a great boundary that was called 1900 . Another hundred years were ground up and churned , and what had happened was all muddied by the way folks wanted it to be  --  more rich and meaningful the farther back it was . In the books of some memories it was the best time that ever sloshed over the world  --  the old time , the gay time , sweet and simple , as though time were young and fearless . Old men who did n't know whether they were going to stagger over the boundary of the century looked forward to it with distaste . For the world was changing , and sweetness was gone , and virtue too . Worry had crept on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ease and beauty ? Ladies were not ladies any more , and you could n't trust a gentleman 's word . There was a time when people kept their fly buttons fastened . And man 's freedom was boiling off . And even childhood was no good any more  --  not the way it was . No worry then but how to find a good stone , not round exactly but flattened and water-shaped , to use in a sling pouch cut from a discarded shoe . Where did all the good stones go , and all simplicity ? A man 's mind vagued up a little , for how can you remember the feel of pleasure or pain or choking emotion ? You can remember only that you had them . An elder man might truly recall through water the delicate doctor-testing of little girls , but such a man forgets , and wants to , the acid emotion eating at the spleen so that a boy had to put his face flat down in the young wild oats and drum his fists against the ground and sob " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and did , " What 's that damned kid lying out there in the grass for ? He 'll catch a cold . " Oh , strawberries do n't taste as they used to and the thighs of women have lost their clutch ! 129130 EAST OF EDENAnd some men eased themselves like setting hens into the nest of death . History was secreted in the glands of a million historians . We must get out of this banged-up century , some said , out of this cheating , murderous century of riot and secret death , of scrabbling for public lands and damn well getting them by any means at all . Think back , recall our little nation fringing the oceans , torn with complexities , too big for its britches . Just got going when the British took us on again . We beat them , but it did n't do us much good . What we had was a burned White House and ten thousand widows on the public pension list . Then the soldiers went to Mexico and it was a kind of painful picnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be uncomfortable when it is so easy and pleasant to eat at home . The Mexican War did two good things though . We got a lot of western land , damn near doubled our size , and besides that it was a training ground for genet- als , so that when the sad self-murder settled on us the leaders knew the techniques for making it properly horrible . And then the arguments : Can you keep a slave ? Well if you bought him in good faith , why not ? Next they 'll be saying a man ca n't have a horse . Who is it wants to take my property ? And there we were , like a man scratching at his own face and bleeding into his own heard . Well , that was over and we got slowly up off the bloody ground and stinted westward . " There came boom and bust , bankruptcy , depression . Great public thieves came along and picked the pockets of every- one who had a pocket . Tea hell with that rotten century ! Let 's get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's close it like a book and go on reading ! New chapter , new life . A man will have clean hands once we get the lid slammed shut on that stinking century . It 's a fair thing ahead . There 's no rot on this clean new hundred years . It 's not stacked , and any bastard who deals seconds from this new deck of years  --  why , we 'll crucify him head down over a privy . Oh , but strawberries will never taste so good again and the thighs of women have lost their clutch ! Chapter 13 ISometimes a kind of glory lights up the mind of a man . It happens to nearly everyone . You can feel it growing or preparing like a fuse burning toward dynamite . It is a feeling in the stomach , a delight of the nerves , of the forearms . The skin tastes the air , and every deep- drawn breath is sweet . Its beginning has the pleasure of a great stretching yawn ; it flashes in the brain and the whole world glows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life in the gray , and the land and trees of him dark and somber . The events , even the important ones , may have trooped by faceless and pale . And then  --  the glory  --  so that a cricket song sweetens his ears , the smell of the earth rises chanting to his nose , and dappling light under a tree blesses his eyes . Then a man pours outward , a torrent of him , and yet he is not diminished . And I guess a man 's importance in the world can be measured by the quality and number of his glories . It is a lonely thing but it relates us to the world . It is the mother of all creativeness , and it sets each man separate from all other men . I do n't know how it will be in the years to come . There are monstrouschanges taking place in the world , forces shaping a futurewhose face we do not ' know . Some of these forces seem evil to us , perhaps not in themselves but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is true that two men can lift a biggerstone than one man . A group can build automobiles quicker andbetter than one man , and bread from a huge factory is cheaper andmore uniform . When our food and clothing and housing all are bornin the complication of mass production , mass method is bound to getinto our thinking and to eliminate all other thinking . In our time massor collective production has entered our economics , our politics , andeven our religion , so that some nations have substituted the idea collectivefor the idea God . This in my time is the danger . There is great132132 EAST OF EDENtension in the world , tension toward a breaking point , and men are unhappy and confused . At such a time it seems natural and good to me to ask myself these questions . What do I believe in ? What must I fight for and what must I fight against ? Our species is the only creative species , and it has only one crea- tive instrument , the individual mind and spirit of a man . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good collaborations , whether in music , in art , in poetry , in mathematics , in philosophy . Once the miracle of creation has taken place , the group can build and extend it , but the group never invents anything . The preciousness lies in the lonely mind of a man . And now the forces marshaled around the concept of the group have declared a war of extermination on that preciousness , the mind of man . By disparagement , by starvation , by repressions , forced di- rection , and the stunning hammerblows of conditioning , the free , rov- ing mind is being pursued , roped , blunted , drugged . It is a sad suicidal course our species seems to have taken. e- And this I believe : that the free , exploring mind of the individual human is the most valuable thing in the world . And this I would fight for : the freedom of the mind to take any direction it wishes , un- directed . And this I must fight against : any idea , religion , or govern- ment which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am and what I am about . I can understand why a system built on a pattern must try to destroy the free mind , for that is one thing which can by inspection destroy such a system . Surely I can understand this , and I hate it and I will fight against it to preserve the one thing that separates us from the uncreative beasts . If the glory can be killed , we are lost. 2Adam Tiask grew up in grayness , and the curtains of his life were like dusty cobwebs , and his days a slow file of half-sorrows and sick dissatisfactions , and then , through Cathy , the glory came to him . It does n't matter that Cathy was what I have called a monster . Perhaps we ca n't understand Cathy , but on the other hand we are capable of many things in all directions , of great virtues and great sins . And who in his mind has not probed the black water ? Maybe we all have in us a secret pond where evil and ugly thingsEAST OF EDEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the swimmingbrood climbs up only to fall back . Might it not be that in the dark pools of some men the evil grows strong enough to wriggle over the fence and swim free ? Would not such a man be our monster , and are we not related to him in our hidden water ? It would be absurd if we did not understand both angels and devils , since we invented them . Whatever Cathy may have been , she set off the glory in Adam . His spirit rose flying and released him from fear and bitterness and rancid memories . The glory lights up the world and changes it the way a star shell changes a battleground . Perhaps Adam did not see Cathy at all , so lighted was she by his eyes . Burned in his mind was an image of beauty and tenderness , a sweet and holy girl , precious beyond thinking , clean and loving , and that image was Cathy to her husband , and nothing Cathy did or said could warp Adam 's Cathy . She said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not listen , because his Cathy took his arm and started first . So bright was his glory that he did not notice the sullen pain in his brother , did not see the glinting in his brother 's eyes . He sold his share of the farm to Charles , for less than it was worth , and with that and his half of his father 's money he was free and rich . The brothers were strangers now . They shook hands at the station , and Charles watched the train pull out and rubbed his scar . He went to the inn , drank four quick whiskies , and climbed the stairs to the top floor . He paid the girl and then could not perform . He cried in her arms until she put him out . He raged at his farm , forced it , added to it , drilled and trimmed , and his boundaries extended . He took no rest , no recreation , and he became rich without pleasure and respected , without friends . Adam stopped in New York long enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the train which bore them across the continent . How they happened to go to the Salinas Valley is very easy to understand . In that day the railroads  --  growing , fighting among themselves , striving to increase and to dominate  --  used every means to increase their traffic . The companies not only advertised in the newspapers , they issued booklets and broadsides describing and picturing the beauty and richness of the West . No claim was too extravagant  --  wealth was unlimited . The Southern Pacific Railroad , headed by the wild energy of Leland Stanford , had begun to dominate the Pacific134 EAST OF EDENCoast not only in transportation but in politics . Its rails extended down the valleys . New towns sprang up , new sections were opened and populated , for the company had to create customers to get custom . The long Salinas Valley was part of the exploitation . Adam had seen and studied a fine color broadside which set forth the valley as that region which heaven unsuccessfully imitated . After reading the literature , anyone who did not want to settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush at his purchase . He bought a rig and drove around , meeting the earlier comers , talking of soil and water , climate and crops , prices and facilities . It was not speculation with Adam . He was here to settle , to found a home , a family , perhaps a dynasty . Adam drove exuberantly from farm to farm , picked up dirt and crumbled it in his fingers , talked and planned and dreamed . The people of the valley liked him and were glad he had come to live there , for they recognized a man of substance . He had only one worry , and that was for Cathy . She was not well . She rode around the country with him , but she was listless . One morning she complained of feeling ill and stayed in her room in the King City hotel while Adam drove into the country . He returned at about live in the afternoon to find her nearly dead from loss of blood . Luckily Adam found Dr. Tilson at his supper and dragged him from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inserted a packing , and turned to Adam . " Why do n't you wait downstairs ? " he suggested . " Is she all right ? " " Yes . I 'll call you pretty soon . " Adam patted Cathy 's shoulder , and she smiled up at him . Dr. Tilson closed the door behind him and came back to the bed . His face was red with anger . " Why did you do it ? " Cathy 's mouth was a thin tight line . " Does your husband know you are pregnant ? " Her head moved slowly from side to side . " What did you do it with ? " She stared up at him . He looked around the room . He stepped to the bureau and picked up a knitting needle . He shook it in her face . " The old offender  --  the old criminal , " he said . " You 're a fool . You 've nearly killed yourself and you have n't lost your baby . I suppose you took things too , poisoned yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Some of the things you women do ! " Her eyes were as cold as glass . He pulled a chair up beside her bed . " Why do n't you want to have the baby ? " he asked softly . " You 've got a good husband . Do n't you love him ? Do n't you intend to speak to me at all ? Tell me , damn it ! Do n't turn mulish . " Her lips did not move and her eyes did not flicker . " My dear , " he said , " ca n't you see ? You must not destroy life . That 's the one thing gets me crazy . God knows I lose patients because I do n't know enough . But I try  --  I always try . And then I see a deliberate killing . " He talked rapidly on . He dreaded the sick silence between his sentences . This woman puzzled him . There was somethinginhuman about her . " Have you met Mrs. Laurel ? She 's wasting and crying for a baby . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a baby , and you  --  you try to stab yours with a knitting needle . All right , " he cried , " you wo n't speak  --  you do n't have to . But I 'm going to tell you . The baby is safe . Your aim was bad . And I 'm telling you this  --  you 're going to have that baby . Do you know what the law in this state has to say about abortion ? You do n't have to answer , but you listen to me ! If this happens again , if you lose this baby and I have any reason to suspect monkey business , I will charge you , I will testify against you , and I will see you punished . Now I hope you have sense enough to believe me , because I mean it . " Cathy moistened her lips with a little pointed tongue . The cold went out of her eyes and a weak sadness took its place . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I 'm sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you tell me ? " His anger disappeared like mist . " Tell me , my dear . " " It 's hard to tell .. Adam is so good , so strong . I am  --  well , I 'm tainted . Epilepsy . " " Not you ! " " No , but my grandfather and my father  --  and my brother . " She covered her eyes with her hands . " I could n't bring that to my hus-band . " " Poor child , " he said . " My poor child . You ca n't be certain . It 's more than probable that your baby will be fine and healthy . Will you promise me not to try any more tricks ? " " Yes . " 136 EAST OF EDEN " All right then . I wo n't tell your husband what you did . Now lie back and let me see if the bleeding 's stopped . " In a few minutes he closed his satchel and put the knitting needle in his pocket . " I 'll look in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as he came down the narrow stairs into the lobby . Dr. Tilson warded off a flurry of " How is she ? Is she all right ? What caused it ? Can I go up ? " " Whoa , hold up  --  hold up . " And he used his trick , his standard joke . " Your wife is sick . " " Doctor  --  " " She has the only good sickness there is  --  " " Doctor  --  " " Your wife is going to have a baby . " He brushed past Adam and left him staring . Three men sitting around the stove grinned at him . One of them observed dryly , " If it was me now  --  why , I 'd invite a few , maybe three , friends to have a drink . " His hint was wasted . Adam bolted clumsily up the narrow stairs . Adam 's attention narrowed to the Bordoni ranch a few miles south of King City , almost equidistant , in fact , between San Lucas and King City . The Bordonis had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had come to Mrs. Bordoni 's great-grandfather from the Spanish crown . The Bordonis were Swiss , but Mrs. Bordoni was the daughter and heiress of a Spanish family that had settled in the Salinas Valley in very early times . And as happened with most of the old families , the land slipped away . Some was lost in gambling , some chipped off for taxes , and some acres torn off like coupons to buy luxuries  --  a horse , a diamond , or a pretty woman . The nine hundred remaining acres were the core of the original Sanchez grant , and the best of it too . They straddled the river and tucked into the foothills on both sides , for at this point the valley narrows and then opens out again . The original Sanchez house was still usable . Built of adobe , it stood in a tiny opening in the foothills , a miniature valley fed by a precious ever-running spring of sweet water . That of course was why the first Sanchez had built his seat there . Huge live oaks shaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greenness foreignto this part of the country . The walls of the low house were four feet thick , and the round pole rafters were tied on with rawhide ropes which had been put on wet . The hide shrank and pulled joist and rafter tight together , and the leather ropes became hard as ironEAST OF EDEN 137and nearly imperishable . There is only one drawback to this building method . Rats will gnaw at the hide if they are let . The old house seemed to have grown out of the earth , and it was lovely . Bordoni used it for a cow barn . He was a Swiss , an immigrant , with his national passion for cleanliness . He distrusted the thick mud walls and built a frame house some distance away , and his cows put their heads out the deep recessed windows of the old Sanchez house . The Bordonis were childless , and when the wife died in ripe years a lonely longing for his Alpine past fell on her husband . He wanted to sell the ranch and go home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bordoni was asking a big price and using the selling method of pretending not to care whether he sold or not . Bordoni knew Adam was going to buy his land long before Adam knew it . Where Adam settled he intended to stay and to have his unborn children stay . He was afraid he might buy one place and then see another he liked better , and all the time the Sanchez place was drawinghim . With the advent of Cathy , his life extended long and pleasantlyahead of him . But he went through all the motions of carefulness . He drove and rode and walked over every foot of the land . He put a post-hole augur down through the subsoil to test and feel and smell the under earth . He inquired about the small wild plants of field and riverside and hill . In damp places he knelt down and examined the game tracks in the mud , mountain lion and deer , coyote and wild cat , skunk and raccoon , weasel and rabbit , all overlaid with the pattern of quail tracks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the riverbed , patted the trunks of live oak and scrub oak , madrone , laurel , toyon . Bordoni watched him with squinting eyes and poured tumblers of red wine squeezed from the grapes of his small hillside vineyard . It was Bordoni 's pleasure to get a little drunk every afternoon . And Adam , who had never tasted wine , began to like it . Over and over he asked Cathy 's opinion of the place . Did she like it ? Would she be happy there ? And he did n't listen to her noncommittalanswers . He thought that she linked arms with his enthusiasm . In the lobby of the King City hotel he talked to the men who gathered around the stove and read the papers sent down from San Francisco . " It 's water I think about , " he said one evening . " I wonder how deep you 'd have to go to bring in a well . " A rancher crossed his denim knees . " You ought to go see Sam138 LAST OF EDENHamilton , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's a water witch and a well-digger too . He 'll tell you . He 's put down half the wells in this part of the valley . " His companion chuckled . " Sam 's got a real legitimate reason to be interested in water . Has n't got a goddam drop of it on his own place . " " How do I find him ? " Adam asked . " I 'll tell you what . I 'm going out to have him make some angleirons . I 'll take you with me if you want . You 'll like Mr. Hamilton . He 's a fine man . " " Kind of a comical genius , " his companion said. 3They went to the Hamilton ranch in Louis Lippo 's buckboard  --  Louis and Adam Trask . The iron straps rattled around in the box , and a leg of venison , wrapped in wet burlap to keep it cool , jumped around on top of the iron . It was customary in that day to take some substantiallump of food as a present when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay to dinner unless you wished to insult his house . But a few guests could set back the feeding plans for the week if you did not build up what you destroyed . A quarter of pork or a rump of beef would do . Louis had cut down the venison and Adam provided a bottle of whisky . " Now 1 'll have to tell you , " Louis said . " Mr. Hamilton will like that , but Mrs. Hamilton has got a skunner on it . If I was you I 'd leave it under the seat , and when we drive around to the shop , why , then you can get it out . That 's what we always do . " " Does n't she let her husband take a drink ? " " No bigger than a bird , " said Louis . " But she 's got brassbound opinions . Just you leave the bottle under the seat . " They left the valley road and drove into the worn and rutted hills over a set of wheel tracks gulleycd by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the buckboard rocked and swayed . The year had not been kind to the hills , and already in June they were dry and the stones showed through the short , burned feed . The wild oats had headed out barely six inches above the ground , as though with knowledge that if they did n't make seed quickly they would n't get to seed at all . " It 's not likely looking country , " Adam said . " Likely ? Why , Mr. Trask , it 's country that will break a man'sEAST OF EDEN 139heart and eat him up . Likely ! Mr. Hamilton has a sizable piece and he 'd of starved to death on it with all those children . The ranch do n't feed them . He does all kinds of jobs , and his boys are starting to bring in something now . It 's a fine family . " Adam stared at a line of dark mesquite that peeked out of a draw . " Why in the world would he settle on a place like this ? " Louis Lippo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a stranger particularly , if no native was present to put up an argument . " I 'll tell you , " he said . " Take me  --  my father was Italian . Came here after the trouble but he brought a little money . My place is n't very big but it 's nice . My father bought it . He picked it out . And take you  --  I do n't know how you 're fixed and would n't ask , but they say you 're trying to buy the old Sanchez place and Bordoni never gave anything away . You 're pretty well fixed or you would n't even ask about it . " " I 'm comfortably off , " said Adam modestly . " I 'm talking the long way around , " said Louis . " When Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton came into the valley they did n't have a pot to piss in . They had to take what was left  --  government land that nobody else wanted . Twenty-five acres of it wo n't keep a cow alive even in good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad years . There 's people say they do n't know how the Hamiltons lived . But of course Mr. Hamilton went right to work  --  that 's how they lived . Worked as a hired hand till he got his threshing machine built . " " Must have made a go of it . 1 hear of him all over . " " He made a go of it all right . Raised nine children . I 'll bet he has n't got four bits laid away . How could he ? " One side of the buckboard leaped up , rolled over a big round stone , and dropped down again . The horses were dark with sweat and lathered under collar and britching . " I 'll be glad to talk to him , " said Adam . " Well , sir , he raised one fine crop  --  he had good children and he raised them fine . All doing well  --  maybe except Joe . Joe  --  he 's the youngest  --  they 're talking about sending him to college , but all the rest are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house is just on the other side of the next rise . Do n't forget and bring out that whisky  --  she 'll freeze you to the ground . " The dry earth was ticking under the sun and the crickets rasped . " It 's real godforsaken country , " said Louis . " Makes me feel mean , " said Adam . " How 's that ? "
