PIGS : FROM CAVE TO CORN BELT ( 305 pp. ) - Charles Wayland Towns &; Edward Norris Wentworth-University of Oklahoma ( $4 ) . <P> Back in 1812 , all the dock workers around Troy , N.Y . knew " Uncle Sam " Wilson . A tall , talkative meat packer with a friendly word for everybody , Uncle Sam was often on hand to see his Government-consigned barrels of pork and beef loaded on boats and sent down the Hudson for the war against the British . When one passenger asked an Irish watchman at the dock what the " U.S. " stamped on each barrel meant , the watchman had a ready answer : " It must mean Uncle Sam ... he 's feeding the army ! " <P> The story got around and the label stuck . In their passionately partisan study of Pigs : From Cave to Corn Belt , Authors Charles Wayland Towne ( retired publicity director for Anaconda Copper ) and Edward Norris Wentworth ( director of Armour 's Livestock Bureau ) make it clear that a pork packer as Uncle Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than any other commodity , " say the authors , " pork implemented American retaliation against British tyranny in colonial days , and incidentally initiated the great international commerce that has characterized . . . modern U.S. culture . " By 1850 , " Porkopolis " ( Cincinnati ) had become the greatest pork-packing city in the world , a distinction it lost to Chicago when the Civil War froze Southern markets . <P> Adonis &; Hercules . Although Pigs waddles rapidly through world porcine history in a hurry to concentrate on U.S. hogs , it nevertheless roots up enough factual truffles along the way to qualify for its ambitious title . The pig , " the most primitive form of domestic mammal that exists today , " is 39 million years older than million-year-old man . Boars charge about wildly through ancient mythology ; one of them killed handsome Adonis , another was captured alive after a mighty struggle with hefty Hercules . About 5,000 years ago , the Chinese were already eating domestic swine , along with dogs and fowl . When France 's Louis XI was sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancing to bagpipe music succeeded in curing his melancholy . <P> Through the centuries , the hog has obligingly accommodated himself to man 's changing tastes and needs . Refrigeration put an end to the small-boned , fat-heavy hogs ; consumers wanted leaner meat . But hog farmers , working to breed their animal out of the barrel and into the icebox , soon found themselves in another fix : the big-boned hogs of the early 20th Century were shorter on fat all right , but their giant hams were sized to feed an army rather than a family , and they were stringy besides . After World War I , hog breeders went to work again and finally molded today 's trim , streamlined 225-lb. porker , with apartment-size hams . <P> The Mortgage Lifter . Before they plunge into their descriptions of breeds and crossbreeds and their careful detailing of modern packinghouse procedures , Authors Towne and Wentworth attempt to lift their hero out of the sty and onto the pedestal . A pig , they say , can swim , pull a small cart , even substitute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can be housebroken : " By nature he is one of the cleanest of animals . "
