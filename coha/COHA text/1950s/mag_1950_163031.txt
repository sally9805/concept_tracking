When shaggy-haired William Alexander Bustamante tours the Jamaican countryside , field hands from the cane and banana plantations crowd around him singing a native song called We Will Follow-Bustamante Till We Die . Last week it was clear that the chorused pledge was something more than a catchy calypso lyric . In the British island 's general election , Bustamante and his Labor Party squeezed back into power for a second five-year term . It was Bustamante 's faithful plantation workers , overpowering the heavy urban vote rolled up by the rival socialist People 's National Party , who saved the day . <P> Close Call . For gaunt , 65-year-old Bustamante , the election was another close call in a public life that has been a succession of escapes and escapades . Since he rose to power in Jamaica as a spellbinding union boss ( he is president " for life " of the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union ) he has been interned for sedition , charged with manslaughter ( later acquitted ) and engaged in any number of lesser scrapes with Jamaica 's British rulers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a stern test for " Good Old Busta . " Since his election to the House of Representatives in 1944 , conditions on the island had deteriorated . Unemployment was widespread ; the cost of living had zoomed higher ( up 300% since 1939 ) . <P> There were charges of graft on government contracts . Busta 's hodgepodge Labor Party , loosely held together by adulation for " De Chief , " was beginning to come apart . By contrast , the rival socialist P.N.P. , led by able , Oxford-educated Barrister Norman Washington Manley , seemed in good working order . <P> But Busta handled his campaign with the skill of an old ward-heeler . Convinced that urban Kingston with its higher percentage of literates would go against him , he stayed away from the capital and worked the rural areas . <P> Close Race . He told the descendants of slaves in the country parishes that P.N.P. socialism would mean a return to slavery . He dared P.N.P. leader Manley to a 5,000 bet on the election outcome . Manley haughtily brushed off the wager as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word that Busta himself had not given up hope . In the last stage of the campaign , he made a dashing foray into Kingston . " The P.N.P. say I have run away , " he cried . " Here I am . " <P> Two days later , when the votes were counted , the P.N.P. had won 13 seats , a gain of eight in the 32-member house since the last election . But Busta , with 17 seats and the support of one elected independent , still held a working majority .
