txt Justice Department lawyers were preparing today to go into court on short notice for a national emergency injunction aimed at halting the soft coal strike of the United Mine Workers . The tentative timetable called for a report from President Truman 's board of inquiry tomorrow and a move for the injunction on Monday . That might , be speeded up if mechanical problems permit . The three-man panel completed its report tonight and planned to deliver it to the White House early tomorrow . The country 's coal stocks were reported Friday to have shrunk to a two-week supply as the railroads put into effect at midnight the passenger and freight service cuts ordered by the Interstate Commerce Commission . The Government 's petition is likely to come up ' before Judge Richmond B. Keech , in Federal District Court , who has already agreed to one injunction against the union and its president , John L. Lewis . Judge Keech is one of two judges now taking their turn in Motions Court , and that is where injunction petitions ordinarily go . The judge put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injunction case he ruled on yesterday . Dominick Mallon , representing Robert N. Denham , general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board , had a draft of the order ready today , but union counsel persuaded the court to delay one day . - Union to File Objections Welly K. Hopkins , UMW counsel , said that he would file objections to the findings of fact and conclusions of law and the actual details of the order itself . The union will have thirty days to file an appeal , but Mr. Hopkins said that " I do n't know what we are going to do about that . " Judge Keech told the two lawyers to meet him in his chambers at 9:30 A. M. tomorrow . His ruling was that Mr. Lewis was making certain contract demands on the operators in violation of the " TaftHartley Law . Included were demands for the union shop , a welfare fund with benefits for union members only and an " able and willing " clause , under which the miners claimed the right to suspend work at will without breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Denham said : " Now they will have the area of bargaining defined . This ought to speed up an agreement if they can get those illegal things out of way . I hope they will sit down at once and get some bargaining done . If I had n't hoped for that , I never would have moved for the injunction . " However , there was no move to start bargaining between the operators and the miners at once because of the Government 's plan to seek- a more sweeping injunction as soon as the Board of Inquiry reports . Justice Department lawyers need copies of the board 's report and copies of the President 's order to the Attorney General before going to court . It was possible that the Governs // QUICK MOVE IN VIEW ON COAL INJUNCTION // ment might act before Monday . A Federal judge could sign a restraining order anywhere , anytime with only the Government represented . The order would have the same effect as an injunction , except that it would have a short , specified term of life , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an earlier coal strike . The restraining order was signed on a Saturday night and was supplanted by a temporary injunction , after the union had an opportunity to reply to the complaint . If an eighty-day injunction is issued directing the union officers to call dff the strike , and if the order is carried out effectively , contract negotiations probably will be resumed promptly . If the miners in substantial numbers should refuse to work , the Government would face an extraordinary problem . Two labor leaders who visited the White House on another.matter today were questioned by reporters about the probable national emergency injunction against the miners . Philip Murray , president of the Congress of Industrial OrganizatiOns , remarked that he had often said that " injunctions- do n't mine coal . " William Green , president of thy American Federation of Labor , said that " it aggravates the situation rather than makes it better , " and " they ( the miners ) resent it " ' The National Coal Association estimated that 6,550,000 tons of soft coal were produced last week , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 710,000 tons less- than the preceding ' week and ' 4,835,000 under the corresponding week of last year .
