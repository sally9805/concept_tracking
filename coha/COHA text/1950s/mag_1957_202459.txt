Asian influenza will hit the U.S. this fall before mass immunization can be effective , and the nation faces an epidemic which may strike 15 million to 30 million people . The disease is relatively mild ( in no way comparable to the killing " Spanish flu " of 1918-19 ) , and is likely to cause only a small number of deaths among the feeble young and enfeebled old . But it may compel 10% to 20% of the population in affected areas to take to their beds at the same time , thus cripple essential services . <P> Who Gets It &; When . These disquieting facts emerged last week from a conference on flu and vaccination prospects sponsored by the U.S. Public Health Service . Nub of the problem : the U.S. population has no immunity against this new mutant strain ( TIME , June 24 ) , can gain immunity only from contracting the disease itself or from preventive inoculation with a new vaccine prepared especially to combat it . Despite the best efforts of medical men and vaccine manufacturers around the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fraction of the U.S. population before the disease strikes in force . <P> With these facts in mind , PHS 's Surgeon General Leroy E. Burney has asked six manufacturers* to churn out vaccine as fast as possible , and in response they are putting their virus laboratories on two or three shifts , seven days a week . But there is only so much vaccine available for seeding ; it will grow only at its naturally appointed speed ( in fertilized eggs ) . So , even with their crash program , the manufacturers can promise only 8,000,000 shots of vaccine by mid-September . After that , cooler weather is expected to send the flu rate soaring . <P> The first 4,000,000 doses ( 1 cc. each ) are already earmarked for the armed forces and their dependents overseas . For the next 4,000,000 , Surgeon General Burney suggested , doctors , nurses , hospital attendants and practical nurses ( totaling about 3,000,000 ) should have top priority . Next , he thought , should come essential workers in the transportation , communications and utilities industries . Since these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis there would be no vaccine for the general public until late October . Still , the PHS ( in spite of its experience with polio-vaccine shortages ) is proposing no nationwide system of priorities in allocating the vaccine , relying instead on manufacturers to work out distribution with state and local health officers as best they can . <P> How Many Shots ? For those who can get it , the vaccine will probably cost $1 ( in bulk military orders it costs only 20 to 40 ) , plus doctor 's fees . One shot should trigger the production of protective antibodies in ten to 14 days . Because single shots of flu vaccines are usually effective in only 70% of cases , the armed forces like to give a second shot . In this case , because of short supply , their second shots will probably have to wait . The six manufacturers aim to produce 60 million cc. in all by Feb. 1 . <P> With thousands of scattered cases already reported across the U.S. , most areas have been exposed to the virus by now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather , they could spread from San Francisco to Boston within a month . <P>
