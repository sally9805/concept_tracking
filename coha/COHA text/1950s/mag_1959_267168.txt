The foes of rapid integration won a round in Arkansas last week . Taking its cue from a U.S. Supreme Court decision , which upheld the constitutionality of Alabama 's pupil-placement law last winter , the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in St. Louis ruled that a similar law in Arkansas is legal . Under the law , Arkansas school boards have full authority to assign students on the basis of qualifications not essentially concerned with race . <P> The specific case at issue occurred in the rabidly segregationist Dollarway district near Pine Bluff ( pop . 37,000 ) , where three Negro students applied for immediate entrance to the all-white Dollarway High School . School officials refused , and a U.S. district court ordered the children admitted at once . The Dollarway school board countered by invoking the placement law , assigned the youngsters to a Negro school and appealed the case to the Circuit Court . The Negroes ' next move : to prove , if they can , that the school board acted in bad faith . <P> Many moderate Southerners argue that placement laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed with integration on a slow , peaceful basis . Said Little Rock 's Arkansas Gazette : " The placement laws do make it possible to control and limit the degree of integration in any school district . This is the pattern that offers the hope of a peaceful resolution of our problems . " The trouble , of course , is that they can also be used as an excuse not to integrate at all .
