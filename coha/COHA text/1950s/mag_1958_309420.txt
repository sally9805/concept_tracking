Bearded , robed and barefoot , Krishna Venta ( real name : Francis Heindswatzer Pencovic ) stood before his Seattle audience and , with modest mien , announced that he was Christ returned to earth . As leader of the W.K.F.L. ( Wisdom , Knowledge , Faith , Love ) Fountain of the World , Krishna went on : " It is true , children , I have served time for committing that bad check . . . that I . . . was convicted for a so-called burglary . . . ' ' Many in the audience wept ; some doubted . One challenged : " Are you the embodiment of Christ ? " Replied Krishna : " I can not lie to you to please you . I must tell the truth in the sight of God . I am the Son of God . " With that , a wild female shriek rang through the hall : " I knew it ! " <P> Last week Ralph Muller , 33 , and Peter Kamenoff , 42 , two former members of Krishna Venta 's California-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " had indeed lied-and had indulged in considerable un-Christian intimacies with their wives as well . After complaining in vain to the state attorney general 's office , the two turned up at the cult 's headquarters in a canyon near the San Fernando Valley with 40 sticks of dynamite , cornered the 47-year-old , self-proclaimed prophet in his headquarters building , blew him , themselves , and five other adults and two children to kingdom come . The killers were identified by fingerprints taken from severed hands found in the rubble ; Krishna 's death was certified upon examination of his less mortal dental bridgework.
