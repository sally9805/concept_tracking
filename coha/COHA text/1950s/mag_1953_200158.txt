At the Salzburg Festival , famed mainly for its glittering performances of Mozart and Richard Strauss , the season 's big news was the world premiere last week of a modern , gloomy opera , The Trial . The music was by Gottfried von Einem , who , at 35 , is regarded as Austria 's outstanding postwar composer . The libretto was taken from Franz Kafka 's novel . <P> Everything pointed to success . Kafka 's nightmarish book , first published in 1925 , is enjoying a vogue among intellectuals ; it tells about a kind of tragic Sad Sack-an ordinary man named Joseph K. who is arrested , tried by a mysterious court for an unspecified crime , chivied by a cold , incomprehensible bureaucracy until he is finally led away by two black-clad agents and stabbed to death . This macabre theme of man tortured by forces he does not understand was successfully used by Alban Berg in Wozzeck and by Gian-Carlo Menotti in his more popular Consul . Salzburg first-nighters , remembering Von Einem 's earlier , impressive opera , Danton 's Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with high hopes . But by the final curtain , they found themselves less than spellbound , responded with lukewarm applause . <P> Critics lauded the first-rate production , including the staging , the orchestra ( under the Vienna State Opera 's Karl Boehm ) and the highly imaginative sets ( by German Designer Caspar Neher ) , which evoked a kind of Orwellian gloom amid Salzburg 's sunny , baroque opulence . But critics reluctantly admitted that Von Einem 's score itself was something of a disappointment . <P> Although its overall effect was suitably uncanny , at times it sounded like a good movie sound track rather than full-blooded , dramatic music . Episodic treatment ( like the book , the opera is divided into nine separate scenes ) broke the mood with each intermission . Moreover , critics noted , the Von Einem score was derivative - now a dash of Puccini , now Tchaikovsky , now Stravinsky . The opera 's best feature : three scenes in which Joseph K. ( superbly characterized by German Tenor Max Lorenz ) is involved with different women , all beautifully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will appear at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera this season ) . These scenes are effectively composed in a perfumed , formal style . <P> The Trial will have another day in the critics ' court : performances are scheduled for Berlin 's Staedtische Oper and Manhattan 's City Center this fall .
