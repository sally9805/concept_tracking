Never before had a departing member of a President 's cabinet been ushered out with such fanfare . In the White House Conference Room , President Eisenhower and Mrs. Oveta Gulp Hobby , 50 , the first U.S. Secretary of Health , Education and Welfare , sat before the television cameras . Mrs. Hobby , dressed in a brown and white silk redingote , blinked back tears as the President recalled their first meeting in London in 1942 , when Oveta was commander of the WAAC ( later the WAC ) . Said the President : " Well , Oveta , this is a sad day for the Administration ... I assure you none of us will forget . . . the warm heart you brought to your job as well as your talents . We are just distressed to lose you . " He reddened as Mrs. Hobby , her voice breaking , replied : " I truly feel that God has had His hand on the United States in the kind of leadership you have given us . " <P> Second to Go . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member in U.S. history had stepped down . She was only the second Cabinet member to quit since Eisenhower took office 30 months ago . The first was the only other Democrat in the Cabinet , Secretary of Labor Martin Durkin , who resigned in September 1953 . <P> Prim , trim Oveta Hobby had done a good job of gathering a straggle of federal agencies interested in health , education and welfare into one new Cabinet department . Just a few days before she resigned , Secretary of the Treasury George Humphrey called her " the best man in the Cabinet . " But Oveta Hobby will probably be best remembered for her mistakes . Her department showed a lack of foresight in the Salk polio vaccine program , and even after the furor erupted , Mrs. Hobby insisted that " no one could have foreseen the great acclaim " for the vaccine . <P> Two to Texas .

She delayed resigning until the clamor over the Salk vaccine had diminished . <P> As Mrs. Hobby 's successor , President Eisenhower appointed Under Secretary of the Treasury Marion B. Folsom , a businessman and a Republican , who designed and implemented a private-industry social-security program before Franklin <P> Roosevelt 's New Deal , has been an expert on social-security policy and law for nearly 30 years , and who seems ideally fitted for his new job ( see box ) . Promoted to Folsom 's post at the Treasury was Horace Chapman Rose , 48 , Assistant Secretary of the Treasury and former Cleveland corporation lawyer . An old Ohio neighbor and business associate of George Humphrey , " Chappie " Rose will continue to work closely with his boss in the taciturn , no-nonsense manner that has brought him recognition since he was secretary to Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in 1931-32.
