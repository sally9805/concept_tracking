On the broad , busy streets of Montevideo last week it was hard to detect any signs of malaise . Montevideans looked well-fed , as usual , and stores were crowded with customers . Perhaps in no other Latin American capital were sidewalks so conspicuously free of beggars and ragamuffins . The faces in the crowd , as big-city crowds go , showed a high average of cheer . <P> Spring was on the march in Uruguay , rainbowing roadsides and vacant lots with vivid wild flowers . Cafe owners set out sidewalk tables . At coastal resort hotels , workmen began taking down shutters and painting woodwork in preparation for summer throngs , perennial in a leisure-minded , seashore-loving country that celebrates a national holiday ( Dec. 8 ) called the Day of the Beaches . <P> Throne of Skulls . Montevideans ' cheerfulness reflected not only the coming of spring but their confident , year-round belief that democratic , Nebraska-sized Uruguay is the earth 's closest imitation of paradise . Beneath the remaining layer of fat stored up during Uruguay 's Korean war wool boom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that the country is somehow bound to muddle through . That is why there are some thoughtful citizens who seriously believe that what Uruguay needs is a wakeup , shake-up type of crisis . <P> The nation lived through crises aplenty in its turbulent , trigger-happy youth . Writing of the 19th century Uruguay that he knew as a boy , William Henry ( The Purple Land ) Hudson called the presidential chair a " throne of human skulls . " But in modern Uruguay , Latin America 's most solicitous welfare state , the office of President no longer exists ; its power has been diffused in a nine-man federal council on the Swiss model . Public-school children wear an egalitarian uniform of white smock and blue Windsor tie . The state pensions citizens off at 60 . Even the rich get a break : Uruguay , an anomaly among welfare states , manages to get along without a personal income tax . <P> The omnipresent state handles most of the nation 's banking and insurance , monopolizes coal imports , operates the railroads , the power plants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oil refineries , fisheries , cement plants , a repertory theater , an ambulance service and a string of low-cost restaurants . This statist structure is costly in both obvious and insidious ways . Uruguay suffers from Latin America 's severest case of bureaucratic bloat , with 150,000 civil servants out of a labor force of 1,000,000 . Government deficits pile up year after year . And under the state 's blanket benevolence , incentive is withering . Summer afternoons off to laze on the beach are a national custom . The young retired man has become the national image of success . <P> Tangled Web . Underpinning the welfare state are well-watered grasslands that , by the latest count , feed 22,954,230 sheep and 7,305,462 cattle-roughly ten animals for every man , woman and child in the country. * Wool , meat and hides , making up some 75% of Uruguay 's exports , keep a country that is notably poor in mineral endowment near the top of Latin America 's per-capita-income list . To subsidize the urban welfare state , the Montevideo-dominated national government takes a cut on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to sell beef cheap for city consumption .
