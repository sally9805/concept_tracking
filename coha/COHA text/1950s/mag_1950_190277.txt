About the time that Lucy Sprague Mitchell came to live in Manhattan in 1913 , the superintendent of New York City 's public schools could boast , " I like to pause at 11 o'clock in the morning and reflect that all over New York thousands of pupils are reading the same page of the same book . " School desks were screwed firmly to the floor , and pupils were expected to sit quietly at them . Teachers were supposed to know their subjects well , and little else besides . <P> To bright-eyed Lucy Mitchell ( wife of the famed Columbia economist , Wesley C. Mitchell ) such rigidity seemed all wrong . To do something about her convictions , she went to her wealthy cousin , Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge , * got a promise of $50,000 to start a " bureau of educational experiments . " Taking over an old four-story yeast warehouse on Greenwich Village 's Bank Street , she opened one of Manhattan 's first " progressive " nursery schools . Over the years , she also hired psychologists , physicians , educators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from infancy to adolescence . <P> Last week , in Our Children and Our Schools ( Simon &; Schuster ; $4 ) , Lucy Mitchell laid down Bank Street 's ideas about education and described how they can be put into practice . <P> " That 's Tommyrot . " Although she has always been a progressive , Lucy Mitchell concedes that some of the early U.S. experimenters went too far : " Many were terrified of any kind of memory work . They thought if stultified the child . That 's tommyrot . There 's no reason why a child should n't spell well or why he should n't know his multiplication table . " <P> Another early progressive idea- " that children could manage themselves " - is also disavowed by Bank Street . " Immediate complete freedom for the child , " says <P> Lucy Mitchell , " is as chaotic as the same thing for a country . " <P> As Mrs. Mitchell 's work progressed , she and Bank Street got increasing recognition . Bank Street techniques-free-moving , informally arranged classrooms , teaching the three Rs by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside excursions ( e.g. , to visit fire departments , stores , etc. ) , a hands-off policy to encourage free artistic expression among the children-have been widely , if cautiously , picked up by many public schools . <P> Excuse for Existence . This fall , with spry , 72-year-old Mrs. Mitchell still in charge , Bank Street will be operating pilot classes in four New York City schools ; 300 teachers , many of them from public schools , will be taking courses at Bank Street headquarters . <P> That is the way Lucy Mitchell wants it to be . " I am not in favor , " she says emphatically , " of station-wagon progressive education ... I have always felt our school was purely a laboratory for the public schools . That was the excuse for its existence .
