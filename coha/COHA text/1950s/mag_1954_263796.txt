At this time of year , before the summer rains , the bare , broken landscapes of India 's Bihar state are hazy with the furnacelike heat . This does not stop Bihar 's holy men from tramping the dusty roads , day after day . Nor did it stop 550 disciples of the late Mohandas K. Gandhi from gathering last week at a village called Sarvodayapuri . They met to celebrate the third anniversary of the land-gift movement founded and led by saintly , frail Vinoba Bhave , India 's nearest living equivalent to Gandhi ( TIME , May 11 , 1953 ) . Bhave 's movement urges those who have land to give some , for their souls ' sake , to those who have none . The movement was doing quite well : by April 1954 Bhave had asked for a total of 2,500,000 acres , and this had been surpassed by nearly 10% . <P> So successful had the movement been that the three most popular and influential men in India gathered at Sarvodayapuri . First , there was Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was Nehru 's chief political rival , tall ( 6 ft . ) Jaya Prakash Narayan , the founder and leader of India 's Socialist Party . A fascinating man about whom the rest of the world knows little . Narayan in his youth was a violent Marxist and anti-British revolutionary , and in his middle age is a man of peace and religion and a forthright antiCommunist . It was he who made the biggest news last week . <P> Zealots ' Reproach . Born to a poor peasant 51 years ago in a remote Bihar village , Jaya Prakash Narayan never saw a trolley car until he was 19 . When he won a government scholarship , the facts of Indian life crowded in on him all at once . He joined Gandhi 's civil disobedience movement . Thirsty for learning but respecting Gandhi 's boycott of the British-controlled universities , Narayan went to the U.S. to study . He worked his passage to California , got a job sorting fruit , began studying at Berkeley . During eight years in the U.S. , he studied science and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , factory hand , restaurant waiter , and nearly starved between times . At Wisconsin , an American professor helped convert the earnest young Indian to Marxism , and he went back to India snorting for action . <P> Jailed by the British in 1932 along with many other Congress leaders , Narayan conceived the idea of forming a Socialist group as a galvanizer within the Congress Party . After his release , he founded a union of railway workers with some 1,000,000 members , and also headed the postal workers . <P> In trade-union work , Narayan observed with sorrow how the Communists bored from within , how they ditched the Socialists when the party line changed . Young zealots reproached him for turning toward religion , away from Marxism . Narayan answered : " I was once a Communist . I have watched the Soviet experiment with anguish . If you want to establish a totalitarian state in the name of Socialism , you might do so . But I will not be a party . . . "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
