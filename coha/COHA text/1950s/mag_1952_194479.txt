Some 100 meters off the Isle of Capri one day last week , a stocky ( 5 ft. 6 in. , 150 Ibs . ) Italian Air Force lieutenant named Raimondo Bucher donned a man-from-Mars outfit : rubber frog feet , web-fingered gloves , heavy goggles , and a partial face mask with rubber-padded steel clips to block his nostrils . In his hands he carried a 44-lb. spear gun , weighted with an extra 4.4 Ibs. of lead . Bucher. poised on the rail of the small ship bobbing in the rough water , was aiming to become the first man ever to " skin-dive " ( i.e. , without the aid of artificial breathing apparatus ) deeper than 115 ft . <P> Up with the Marker . Officials of the Federazione Italiana Pesca Sportiva ( Italian Sport Fishing Federation ) dropped a weighted measuring line 148 ft. down into the crystal-clear water . Bucher , now 40 , and eager to win back the record he once held at 98 ft. , failed on his first try ; the pressure dislodged his mask . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the measuring cable . Down he went , while photographers with special equipment recorded the descent . After a long minute and 17 seconds , while anxious officials scanned the choppy water , Bucher bobbed to the surface , beaming in triumph . Aloft he held a cork marker he had pulled from the cable at the new record mark of 128 ft. * <P> Bucher 's dive was not made solely as a stunt . It called attention to the efforts of a small group of fans in one of the world 's hardiest sports : underwater game fishing . Backed in part by Italy 's National Council of Scientific Research ( and also by the Italian Olympic Committee ) , Bucher and a group of nine others are now planning the " first underwater big game hunt in history . " <P> Down with the Sharks . Armed with special spring guns , ranging from needle shooters ( to catch small fish relatively unmarred ) to blunderbuss types shooting two-pound spears , the group will set sail next month for the Southern Red Sea , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The group expects to tackle man-eating sharks and giant octopuses ( with curare-tipped spears ) . <P> In addition to the dangers from the bigger fish , the hunters always take the risk of ruptured eardrums when they plunge deep below the surface . Bucher &; Co. have learned the trade secret to guard against this crippling rupture : exhaling against the steel clips blocking their nostrils , they apply pressure to the middle ear to equalize it with the outside water pressure . Although doctors doubt it can be done , Bucher plans to attempt 148 ft. after returning from the underwater big game hunt . Bucher has his own reply to the medical men : " Even 164 ft. is not beyond human possibility for a person who is in perfect physical condition and gifted in diving technique . " <P> South Sea pearl divers , aided by heavy weights and lines , have reportedly hit depths ranging from 115 to 130 ft.
