txt southern House members say- that direct White House appeals to Republicans defeated the Southerners ' attempt to write jury-trial guarantees into the civil-rights bill . The House June 14 peat down the southern-backed amendment , 199-167 . The vote made it apparent that on the final test the civil-rights bill will pass the House in a form acceptable to President Eisenhower and its northern Democratic-Republican supporters . The showdown is expected June 17 . The future of the bill in the Senate is still uncertain . The Senate Judiciary Committee has written a jury-trial amendment into its civil-rights bill , but 16 senators said June 14 that they plan a move to bypass the judiciary group and bring the House bill to the Senate floor .

He spoke in an interview , adding : " This is the one they had to go all out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed their minds under White House pressure . " There was no record vote . But as far as could be seen , only 30 to 40 of the 200 House Republicans joined the Southern Democrats who filed between tellers to register their support of the jury-trial amendment . The Southerners at one time expressd hopes for 70 or more Republican votes in their favor . On the Democratic side , it appeared that only a handful of members from outside the South voted fqr the amendment . The Republican showing was an indication that President Eisenhower 's pressure on his own party members to support his program and GOP platform pledges generally may be paying off . The southerners  --  and some northerners  --  said the amendment would guarantee what they contended is a constitutional right of trial by jury . But proponents of the civil rights bill contended the amendment would have nullified the measure 's effect in the South and that it would have been inconsistent with the general rule that courts can enforce their own orders without juries.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
