txt Charity fakers have taken at least $120,000,000 out of this year 's record donations by the American public of $4,000,000,000 , a joint legislative committee was told yesterday . The committee , starting four days of public hearings , heard seven witnesses and got an over-all idea of fund-raising and welfare activities in the nation , with special reference to New York State . It also heard detailed testimony about two schemes that were floated on high pressure and flamboyant campaigns , very little of the money received being spent on the stated welfare objectives . It was shown that the National Kids Day Foundation had received in the last five years $3,978,000 , of which only $302,000 was spent for its announced purpose . The Kings County Council of the Marine Corps League , according to sworn testimony , took in $67,244 in the last two years and expended only $4,000 on welfare work , which it described as buying radio and television sets for hospitals and taking disabled veterans to prize fights , Broadway shows and night clubs , Another Hearing Today Further testimony about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fraudulent , will be offered at today 's hearing , to start at 10 A. M. in the County Courthouse on Foley Square . State Sen .. ator Bernard Tompkins , Republican of Queens , is chairman of the committee , which is to make recommendations next month for legislation to supervise the activities of organizations soliciting funds in this state . Sidney Paymer , the committee 's chief counsel , said that the National Kids Day Foundation had ceased to solicit in Los Angeles , where it has national headquarters , because city authorities there disapproved of its methods , but that there was no way under present law to stop its soliciting New York residents by mail . Senator Tompkins , who said there was no Federal or state law to supervise charity organizations , asserted that the New York City ordinance , which requires a permit from the Department of Welfare only if an organization shakes collection cans in the streets , was inadequate . The city law does not cover solicitation by mail , telephone or public advertisement . Even in " the case of street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that calls itself religious . Senator Tompkins said representatives of the District Attorneys would testify Thursday about the legal restrictions on acting against the " nun " racket , in which door-to-door appeals are made by women in homemade or rented nun robes . Frank J. Fletcher Jr. , commandant of Kings County Council , Maxine Corps League , who admitted having kept half of all receipts in a " hidden " bank account and burning financial records , testified that officers of the council had entered " in a conspiracy " to deceive the Department of Welfare about the share of the proceeds paid to the professional fundraiser . " You can not get a professional fund-raiser who will comply with the law of the city , " asserted Mr. Fletcher . He named Philip A. Weiss Associates as the fund-raiser which , he said , kept 47 per cent of all money raised last year and 44 per cent of this year 's funds . Only 12 per cent of the total was left for welfare after the council paid expenses of six delegates to the league 's convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its annual Armistice Ball and paid other non-welfare expenses , Mr. Fletcher admitted . The first witness , F. Emerson Andrews , researcher for the Russell Sage Foundation , said Americans were giving more liberally to charity than ever before . He estimated that contributions this year would rise " substantially " above the previous record of $4,036,000 , - 000 . As " straws in this golden gale , " he said the 1953 poliomyelitis campaign raised $51,500,000 , exceeding by $10,000,000 last year 's record ; the American Cancer Society got $19,700,000 , compared with last year 's $16,400,000 ; contributions to the Red Cross were $85 , - 500,000 , up $1,500,000 ; and most community chests reported increased giving . State 's Total $750,000,000 Of the national total , Mr. Andrews . estimated that New York State contributed 18 per cent , or $750,000,000 . Of this state total , he said , probably $20,000,000 to $25,000,000 went to organizations that were " outright frauds " or worked with professional fundraisers who made false representations to the public and kept most of the proceeds . Additional millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charitable organizations that are well-intentioned and honest but pay too much to fund-raisers or otherwise are wasteful . " The money lost to useful work through charity rackets is not large in proportion to total philanthropy , " Mr. Andrews said , " but it remains important to expose , suppress , and starve out of existence all such endeavors . Charity rackets diminish regular giving by planting doubts in the minds of contributors . " He urged legislation to " protect the public against both the racketeer and the substandard agency . " Lieut . Gen. Willis D. Crittenberger , retired , president of the Greater New York Fund , testified that-the fund , now seeking $9,000 , - 000 to supplement the incomes from various sources of its 423 member agencies , spent an average of 9 per cent of its receipts for fund-raising and 3 per cent for administration , - and distribution expenses . General Crittenberger submitted a list of standards to which members of the fund and many other charities subscribe . He listed also practices specifically forbidden , such as paying fund-raisers on commission , sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " basis , and using names of persons as sponsors or board members without authorization . Through other witnesses and affidavits Mr. Paymer pictured the National Kids Day Foundation as guilty of all these practices . He said that Jimmy Fidler , a motion picture columnist , originator and president of the foundation , did not draw any salary himself but had entered into a contract under which Gayton Associates , Inc. , of Chicago , sent out millions of unsolicited fountain pens and name labels to persons on " sucker lists " and asked them to mail contributions " to help underprivileged children . " Nathan Frankel , the committee 's chief investigator , said 82 per cent of the foundation 's receipts went for fund-raising , 2.5 per cent for administrative expenses , 7.5 per cent to promote " National Kids Day , " and 8 per cent was available for future use , as of July 1 . Affidavits were read from Bing Crosby , the singer , and Mrs. Bob Hope , the comedian 's wife , whose names had been used by Mr. Fidler in appeals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George H. Kerner , the committee 's associate counsel , said the activities of the Kings County Council Marine Corps League should not be taken as a reflection on any other unit of the league , composed of 22,000 former marines through the nation . A member of the investigating committee , Assemblyman Lawrence M. Rulison , Republican of Syracuse , is a league member . Mr. Frankel testified that the league 's New York Council had spent 62.5 per cent of its receipts for fund-raising .
