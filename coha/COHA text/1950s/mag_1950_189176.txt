" CONGRATULATIONS , " the cable read , " CAN HARDLY WAIT TO MEET WHAT WE ARE SURE MUST BE THREE AND HALF KILOS DYNAMITE . " Frank Kirton , 43 , beamed as he read it ; his wife had just given birth to a son , weight 3 kilograms . Somehow , Argentina 's ever-alert federal police got hold of a copy of the cable ; their gimlet eyes lingered long over the word " dynamite . " Kirton , after all , was a foreigner- a Brazilian-born Briton . And he owned a ranch in Gualeguaych in Entre Rios Province , just across the river from Uruguay-mighty handy for smuggling dynamite . <P> Even more alarming was a subsequent telegram from another friend of the Kir-tons in northern Argentina : " WHEN NEXT WE COME BUENOS AIRES LETS PLAN PAINT TOWN RED . " Translated for the police into literal Spanish , this one conjured up a bloody business indeed-a Communist rising , perhaps , or a latter-day storming of the Bastille . <P> The " plot , " the cops decided , was obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then embarking with his wife on an excursion up the Paran River for some ceremonies in connection with the Year of San Martin . Police cutters were hastily ordered out , with machine guns at the ready , to escort the presidential yacht . Police jeeps raced along the banks of the river spotting " intriguers . " At the ceremony itself , the President could hardly be seen for the swarm of blue-uniformed police who surrounded him . <P> Suspicion deepened into certainty when the police discovered that there were two U.S. citizens-brothers George and Arthur Oppen-living in Gualeguaych . At 6 o'clock one morning , five husky cops strode into Kirton 's bedroom , hauled him off to jail . Not only the Oppens but three members of Argentina 's moribund Conservative Party who had also been friendly with Kirton or the Oppens were arrested . For good measure , a few members of the troublesome Radical Party and a Communist or two were also nabbed . In all , 24 men were arrested ; all were held incommunicado . <P> After days of futile inquiries and protests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kirton 's release . The police , until then mum about the whole affair , finally admitted that the arrests had been made-in an investigation of " a plot to sow confusion and dissension . " Next day the federal judge charged with the investigation denounced the plot as a phony , ordered the rest of the suspects freed . Federal Police Chief Arturo Bertollo hurriedly departed for a few weeks ' rest in Argentina 's beautiful Andean lakes region .
