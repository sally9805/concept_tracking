" Some were pleased , some were shocked , none remained indifferent on hearing that the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University , accompanied by his spouse , is to take off tomorrow from , one of the quadrangles of Christ Church in a helicopter . " <P> To the uninitiated , a lighthearted essay on such a topic might seem out of place amid the somber rumblings of the London Times 's editorial page . But generations of Britons have learned to expect just such things in the Thunderer 's " fourth leader , " i.e. , the item usually fourth in sequence on its editorial page , an unfailing source of quiet , literate , gentle humor . Last week , for the second year in a row , the Times published a collection ( Fourth Leaders from the Times ; the Times Publishing Co. , London ; 8/6 ) of the year 's best work of its anonymous editorial writers . Covering everything from stamp collecting to new arrivals at the zoo , the fourth leaders not only range the quirks of British life but also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unruffled Manner . " Foreign correspondents , " one fourth leader observes , " often attribute the content of a dispatch to ' usually well-informed circles , ' and there is something very striking about the phrase . The choice of adverb is peculiarly pregnant , contriving as it does simultaneously to affirm faith and to adumbrate doubt . It implies that the correspondent has found these circles to be reliable in the past , but it sounds at the same time a note of caution . ' You know what these foreigners are , ' it seems to say ; ' do n't blame me if they 've got hold of the wrong end of the stick this time ' . . . " <P> The leader-writers pay their respects to British phlegm amid emergency : " A recent incident at Penzance county court . . . is a reminder that man 's mastery of the unexpected is not confined to the realm of fiction . . . The registrar approached the matter . . . in a discreet and unruffled manner . His question to the witness , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to the proprieties of the court . . . Having been answered in the negative there followed the conclusion delivered in unemotional monosyllables : ' Well , then , your head is on fire . ' " <P> " It Could Be Worse . " The burdens imposed by England 's austerity and bureaucracy haunt many of the paragraphs : " . . . There was a time when rations were things that only soldiers were expected to live on . . . " Sympathizing with civil servants who dwell in " bedsitting rooms , " ' the Times asks : " Is it really possible to entertain with any degree of elegance in a room that contains one 's pyjamas , and one 's butter ration , one 's hair oil and one 's Empire sherry . . . ?
