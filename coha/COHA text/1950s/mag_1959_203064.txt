ON the remote and mysterious plain , the crenelated walls with their eleven great gates and 181 watchtowers gleamed in the night . " Seen thus , " wrote British Traveler Fitzroy Maclean in Escape to Adventure-an account of his journeys in 1938 to forbidden parts of the U.S.S.R. - " Bukhara seemed an enchanted city , with its pinnacles and domes and crumbling ramparts white and dazzling in the pale light of the moon . " <P> But in daylight , the tinkling of silver bells and the aromatic incense of another age vanished like a mirage in the Kara Kum Desert . A Red flag flapped on the 203-foot-high summit of the Great Minaret , from which for centuries cruel khans and emirs had cast their enemies to their deaths . Over the main gate , in Russian and Uzbek , Maclean read the inscription : Town Soviet . Elsewhere he found decay and neglect . The miles of covered shops in Central Asia 's most fabled bazaar had dwindled to a handful of grubby stalls , and only a few of the city 's former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) were in use . <P> In the crumbling ruins , Maclean recognized a deliberate Communist policy . Because the powerful mullahs of this age-old Mohammedan stronghold had resisted Sovietization , the city had been sealed off and left to die . <P> In the two decades since then , few foreigners have seen Bukhara . But its neighboring ancient cities on the vast Central Asian steppes seem to have learned their lesson . In the bustling streets of modern Tashkent and the redolent , mud-walled courtyards of Samarkand ( pop . 170,000 ) , short , moonfaced Uzbeks with golden skin and embroidered skullcaps no longer call the Russians hated koperlar ( infidels ) . The commissars have done their work well . This summer hundreds of tourists , many of them Americans , flying southeast from Moscow in swift TU-IO4 jets that make the 2,500-mile trip to Tashkent in four hours , have been rewarded with satisfying peeks at these ancient cities , set like " green jewels on a withered hand , " in a harsh and little-known land ( see color pages ) . <P> Ancient Battlegrounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Soviet Central Asia is a region as big as India , half as big as the U.S. Mountain ranges , deserts as bone-dry as the Sahara , and interminable wastes of grassy steppes make it one of the earth 's most inhospitable areas . But from this Eurasian heartland came Aryans to populate the West , and across its pink sands marched generations of world conquerors . In 329 B.C. Alexander the Great sacked Samarkand ( " Place of Sugars " ) , a city already centuries old . Rebuilt , Samarkand became one of the central depots on the great Silk Road from Byzantium to China , and flourished as a brilliant seat of Arab civilization , only to be destroyed again by Genghis Khan . Near the end of the 13th century , Marco Polo reported it once more a " very great and eminent city , " and 100 years later Tamerlane made it the capital of his empire , which stretched from the Hellespont to the Ganges , and from Siberia to the Persian Gulf .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
