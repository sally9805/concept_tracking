txt A proposal to merge the New York Trust Company and the Chemical Corn Exchange Bank has been approved by directors of both institutions , it was announced last night . If completed , the merger would restore Chemical Corn to its place as the third largest bank in the city and the fourth largest in the nation . It was deposed from that status by the recent merger of J. P. Morgan &; Co. , Inc. , and the Guaranty Trust Company of New York . The new bank would be called the Chemical Bank New York Trust Company . With more than 4,300,000,000 in total resources , the merged bank would rank after the Bank of America , National Trust and Savings Association , San Francisco , the Chase Manhattan Bank , and the First National City Bank of New York . New York Trust , largely a " wholesale " institution , would add seven offices to Chemical Corn 's ninety-four . A " wholesale " bank caters chiefly to business borrowers . In contrast , a " retail " institution  --  such ? as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns as well as those of small savers and borrowers . Chemical Corn is now the city 's fourth largest bank and New York Trust ranks ninth . // The proposal , which is subject to approval by stockholders and regulatory authorities , involves the exchange of one and threefourths shares of Chemical Corn for each share of New York Trust . In the over-the-counter marH ket . where bank shares arel traded . New York Trust shares closed yesterday at 103 bid , up 5 points for the day . Chemical Corn closed at 65% bid , down 3 's point . At this price , New York Trust holders would receive a value of slightly more than $115 for each share . The rise in the price of New York Trust shares was the climax of a week of steady advance in which the stock gained almost 10 points . Top Officers Proposed The announcement by Harold H. Helm , chairman of Chemical Corn , and Adrian M. Massie , chairman of New York Trust , said Mr. Helm would remain as chairman and chief executive officer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust committee and general supervisor of the combined trust departments . Hulbert S. Aldrich , president of New York Trust , would become a vice chairman of the board , along with Gilbert H. Perkins , who now holds that post at Chemical Corn . Isaac B. Grainger , president of Chemical Corn . would retain that post . The five would comprise the bank 's top management team . Willis , a vice president and a director of New York Trust , would become a senior vice president of the merged bank . The statement gave no specific reason for the merger . The consolidation , Mr. Helm and Mr. Massie said , would " make for increased and more effective competition not only in this country but nationally and internationally . " This seemed to allude to the growing number of bank mergers and the creation of larger institutions . A merger permits a bank to increase its lending limit to individual customers . Thus , a merger such as that of Morgan and Guaranty earlier this year forces other banks to consider like steps to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be approved by the State Superintendent of Banks and the Federal Reserve Board , No date has been set for the required special stockholders ' meetings , An Internal Fight The merger would mean the end of seven years of discussions and rumors involving New York Trust and other large New York institutions . It would mean the end also of an internal fight that erupted last January in an unsuccessful effort to add five insurgent directors to New York Trust 's nineteen-member board . In 1952. management completed a merger deal with the Manufacturers Trust Company involving an exchange of 1 2/3 shares of Manufacturers Trust for each share of New York Trusts . But stockholders balked at the arrangement as not sufficiently rewarding and the agreement was dissolved . In late 1957 , after reports of merger offers from large New York banks , among them Chemical Corn , the management agreed to " explore " merger invitations that might come from other banks . As a result , a group of dissidents agreed to ' , refrain from a proxy fight at ' the annual meeting in January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a hurried trip to 11-lartford , Conn. , to obtain support from insurance cbmpanies and other institutional stockholders . After the 1958 meeting , the dissidents , augmented by the bank 's largest stockholder , a holding company representing ' the Henry Phipps estate , charged that management was closing the door to merger inIvitations by insisting that . specific dollars-and-cents proposals be made . The Morgan Guaranty deal , which was announced last DeIcember , was cited as a case in point . Guaranty , the dissidents said , had turned to Morgan only after being rebuffed by the officers of New York Trust . Joined by some jnstitutional stockholders , the dissidents went ahead with their ' deferred proxy fight at last January 's annual meeting . The result was a e- resoundin victory for ? manao'ement , 810,000 shares to 256,000 , with 89 per cent of the outstanding shares . Overtones of the proxy fight ' were heard subsequently in Albany . With the endorsement of Senator Walter J. Mahoney , Republican of Buffalo , the majority leader , a bill was introduced ' by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cumulative voting , which would make it easier for them to obtain representation on the board of a statechartered bank . Under cumulative voting a stockholder may spread the votes represented by his shares among all candidates for election as directors or lump them for one or more candidates . The bill was not passed . New York Trust was incorporated in 1889 as the New York Security ' and Trust Company . In 1904 it merged with the Continental Trust Company and took its present name a year later . In 1921 it acquired the Liberty National Bank and the Statue of Liberty symbol , which has been the bank 's emblem since . In 1949 it acquired the Fulton Trust Company . The Chemical Corn Exchange Bank represents the union of two historic banking organizations : the Chemical Bank and Trust Company , organized in 1823 as the New York Chemical Manufacturing Company , and the Corn Exchange Bank Trust Company . organized in 1852 . Their merger in 1954 brought together two dissimilar orwanizations , one of the city 's leading " wholesale " banks and a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
