txt James R. Hoffa began tossing punches today at one of his few rivals for leadership of the nation 's largest union , the International Brotherhood of Teamsters . His target was Thomas L. Hickey , secretary-treasurer of the 10,000-member Local 807 in New York and fellow vice president of the union . Hoffa , a director , is chairman of the union 's Central States Council . ? Before walking into a longdeferred meeting of the union 's executive board , Hoffa tossed into the lap of Mr. Hickey and Martin T. Lacey , a former New York union leader , responsibility for unsavory union conditions spotlighted in the Senate rackets inquiry over the last fortnight . Hoff a underwent several days of questioning . Hoffa Role Is Cited The gist of the Senatorial disclosures was that Hoff a was the mainspring of improper activities under scrutiny . These involved collusion with racketeers in the establishment of " phony " union locals , the hearings developed . " Mr. Hickey and Mr. Lacey were in charge of that operatibn the New York teamster situation , " Hoffa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty to notify our committee before this committee the Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in the Labor or Management Field brought it to our attention . " I do n't believe anyone has the right to grant charters and abuse the power of the constitution . But I 've been sitting on this board five years , and I have n't heard one charge filed against the people of New York . It was the duty of Mr. Hickey and Mr. Lacey to report . " Supplanted by O'Rourke Mr. Lacey was president of the union 's Joint Council . 16 , comprising 125,000 members in the New York area . He was supplanted by John J. O'Rourke , a Hoffa henchman . Hoffa 's remarks were made , in an anteroom of the sumptuous expected to last two or three days . Its main chore will be consideration of charges made against the union by the Ethical Practices Committee of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations . Mr. Hickey was only a : few // yards away during Hoffa 's colloquy with reRorters , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hickey had acknowledged , without elaboration , that he would be a candidate to succeed Dave Beck of Seattle as the union 's president . Mr. Beck has been under attack on charges of juggling union funds . The election will take place at the union 's convention opening in Miami Beach Sept. 30 . One Candidate Drops Out Another prospective candidate , Joseph J. Diviny of San Francisco , a union vice president , said today he had decided not to oppose Hoffa . The stocky , 44-year-old Hoffa , whose aggressiveness elevated him from a low-echelon union foothold to influence rivaling Mr. Beck 's , is considered to have the inside track for the presidency . The executive board is composed of Mr. Beck , John F. English , secretary-treasurer , and the union 's eleven vice presidents . All were on hand today . The meeting had been postponed repeatedly since July 1 because of involvements of Hoffa and other members in investigations and trials . The other vice presidents are Dan J. Murphy of St. Louis , John J. Conlin of Hoboken , N. J. , John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brewster of Seattle , Sidney L. Brennan of Minneapolis , Einar Mohn of Washington and Harry Tevis of Pittsburgh . Hoffa , recently acquitted of conspiring to plant a spy on the Senate committee staff , wound up on Friday four days ' intensive interrogation by the committee . Over his many pleas of lack of memory about his recent activities , extensive evidence was presented of close collaboration between him and John Dioguardi , a New York racketeer known as Johnny Dio , in an effort to win control of Joint Council 16 . Hoffa Remains Offstage Hoffa remained tactfully offstage as Mr. Beck , who was staying at another hotel , walked into a swarm of reporters and photographers in the lobby of the Sheraton-Town House a few minutes before the 10 A. M. meeting time . To a barrage of questions , Mr. Beck said there was no possibility of his taking another term as president " even for $250,000 . " He said his main reason for retirement was his wife 's health ; that he had no plans for any organized activity ; and that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment which were of no value to me ? you give it all right back to the Government again . " He said he would indicate no preference as to his successor ? that Hoffa , Mr. Hickey , Mr. O'Brien or Mr. Mohn " all would make good presidents . " Questioned on the point again , he , repeated the names Hoffa , O'Brien and Mohn . Among ? the union executives on the sidelines was Brewster , the dapper president of the Western Conference of Teamsters and race-horse enthusiast . Last Thursday he was sentenced to a year 's imprisionment for contempt of Congress for his reticence in testifying about his and the union 's affairs . He is free on $1,000 bail pending appeal . He genially declined to comment on the board meeting , the presidential competition , or anything else , remarking with a laugh : " The only people who get in trouble are those who talk . I lost my job six months ago ? as far as the newspapers are concerned . " Upstairs a few minutes later , Hoffa , teetering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Senatorial going over and radiated quiet assurance about his presidential prospects . " Hoffa is a rank-and-filer , " he said , shifting into the thirdperson form of reference that notables sometimes affect . " It will be up to the delegates at the convention . But I know a lot of rank-and-filers around this country . " Of the Senatorial disclosures , he said : " Ninety-nine per cent of our New York unions are the highest type in this country  --  they 're beyond , reproach . I 've made the statement all my life that no one has the right to abuse authority . It 's been done in rare instances , but  --  well , I do n't want to say anything more until this beard has had a chance to investigate . " He said he thought the union convention would do " just what it was going to do two weeks ago  --  elect the candidate of their choice , " and this would be unaffected by last week 's hearings in Washington . . " I answered the committee 's questions to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't believe anyone can recall his telephone conversations over a long period of time . " He said , " There is no question the teamsters union is going to have to change and alter some of the situations existing around the country . " Asked if in his allegations of dereliction on the part of Messrs . Hickey and Lacey he meant the involvement of Dio in the New , York situation , he replied cryptically : " No  --  the people who abused some charters . " The teamsters ' executive board has to devise a response to the A. F. L.-C . I. 0 , Ethical Practices Committee 's allegations for consideration by the A. F. L.-C . I. 0 . Executive Council in New York Sept. 24 . The teamster board also is setting up- convention agenda , discussing possible constituional amendments , and con-$ sidering fifteen appeals in union disciplinary proceedings . The union has 1,400,000 members . Mr. Beck described the Spi ? sion as routine .               @ @ @ @ @ @
