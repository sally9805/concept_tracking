ON THE fourth of December , 1915 , one of the strangest caravans in the annals of American history set out on a voyage for the fleshpots of Europe . The beast of burden was the good ship Oscar II , an old single-stacker from the Scandinavian Lines ; the goods it carried were an assorted lot of feminists , cranks , do-gooders , students , joyriders , correspondents , and sincere devotees ; the purpose of the adventure was to bring peace on earth to a continent that was tearing itself asunder with terrible ferocity . At the rail as the ship sailed was a thin spare man with keen eyes and a face lined with conviction , a man with an immense amount of money and an equally immense amount of gullibility : Henry Ford . The story of the Ford Peace Ship has come down to us as one of the great guffaws of history ; from beginning to end it was a journalist 's delight . Never has so grandiose a project foundered on such Lilliputian trivia . Invitations were sent to every Congressman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by all the notables . Blessings weresought from the Pope and from the President ; the telegram to Rome was addressed to a Pope dead a thousand years , and President Wilson refused to give official countenance to the trip . Hardly had the delegates been at sea a week when they fell to fighting among themselves ; rumors of a mutiny reached other ships who solicitously offered help . When the Oscar II reached Christiana , Norway , Ford was quoted as saying : " The landing of the peace pilgrims will be regarded as the most benevolent thing America ever did " ; within a week he had sailed back for America with hoots and jeers ringing in his ears . " I did n't get much peace , " he announced with characteristic aplomb , " but I learned that Russia is going to be a great market for tractors . " It has taken America a long while to reassess this comic-opera footnote to its history ; the verdict of a heartless , not to say jingoistic press sank deep . But in retrospect , a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foolishness of the venture . As Mark Sullivan has written in Our Times : " If buffoons pirouetted across the world stage in 1915 , they were not Ford and the half-dozen who participated with him in the project of halting the madness of Europe ; the buffoons were the rulers and statesmen and diplomats whose inability to maintain peace among civilized nations stood as the most tragic failure in all the annals of humanity . " AND now , thirty-five years later , another Ford ship has set out on an equally audacious mission . Bigger , more modern , infinitely more carefully engineered than the Oscar II , it is also dedicated to the proposition that a few men of good will and a great deal of money can do something to make this a more decent world to live in . The captain and the crew of the new Ford ship of peace are quite aware of the fate of the Oscar II , but they are willing to run the risk of looking like fools , if they can thereby deflect by an inch the forces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess of modern times . The new Ford venture for man 's welfare is the Ford Foundation , an immense philanthropic trust set up in 1936 by Edsel Ford , enriched in the forties by the acquisition of his and Henry Ford 's estates , and launched on its mission in 1950 . Not being people to do things by halves , the Fords have created a behemoth of an institution that makes the previous giants in the field ? the Rockefeller and Carnegie and Duke and Kresge trusts ? look like exhibits out of the Hundred Neediest Cases . In a nation accustomed to philanthropy on a mammoth scale , this is still big enough to evoke an astonished whistle : half a billion dollars ? which as we shall see later is a moderate estimate of its wealth ? is money even as the government counts it . And not only is the Ford Foundation big , but its objectives are as wide as the sky . It has marked out for itself five areas of human affairs which make old Henry Ford 's ideas look like timid conservatism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but its program also aims at aiding democracy , advancing education , supporting economic well-being , and extending our knowledge of human behavior . Nothing picayune about that . And in addition to being big and ambitious , the Foundation is courageous . To carry outits program it has picked Paul Hoffman , a strong and independent man , to guide the Ford millions as he and his associates see fit and as they deem best . Hoffman took the job only after he was convinced that Henry Ford II would have the courage to support activities which might possibly redound unfavorably to the public-relations value of the name of Ford ? activities which might tar the Ford name with vicious labels or defame it with cheap ridicule . " We may sail twenty peace ships , " said Hoffman , " and not a one of them may reach shore . " Young Ford said that was okay with him . Hoffman took the job and chose as his chief associates such vigorous men as Robert M. Hutchins , chancellor of the University of Chicago ; Chester C. Davis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Rowan Gaither , Jr. , San Francisco lawyer and chairman of the Rand Corporation ; and Milton Katz , Harvard Law School professor and Ambassador-atLarge for ECA . In Hoffman 's own words : " The Ford Foundation has the biggest blank check in history . " T HEY wrote $23,000,000 out of that blank check in a year of operation ? an ex- penditure equal to that of the ten largest foundations in 1944 . A little over $1,300.000 went to bolster up the Free University of Berlin ? an outpost of democratic learning at the most exposed salient of our cold war frontier . Something like $1,200,000 is ticketed for the first real big-time experiments in making radio and TV shows of an adult caliber that will be good enough entertainment to hold their own commercially against the pull of soap operas and wrestling bouts . Five millions have been set aside for overseas expenditures . In India and Pakistan this money will go for spearhead projects like simple demonstration farms where food output may be raised by as much as a third in ways that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of technical high school where young Pakistanis will learn how to use machines and how to teach other young Pakistanis how to use machines . More than a million dollars has been used to improve our education by giving outstanding young instructors a chance to take a year of to better their own teaching abilities , and another million plus is being used to see if 161/2-year-olds can take a year of college before they get pulled into the Army ? and thereby bridge the educational gap caused by our military program . And these are just the more spectacular expenditures . Ford money has also been used to finance the resettlement of refugees from behind the Iron Curtain , it has gone into the international exchange of students and scholars , it has been tapped to help support an institute for a freer press , and it is being used in a dozen projects for adult education . The Foundation maintains its head office in Pasadena , where Hoffman and his associates engage in that most arduous of all activities : thinking . In the offices in New York are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with organizations who will carry out Ford-financed ideas . They lead a busy and rather bewildering life . On Monday they will be investigating a plan for elementary education in the Belgian Congo , on Tuesday a program for the psychiatric care of orphans , on Wednesday documentary radio programs for Latin America , on Thursday a study of Midwest regional planning , on Friday a proposal to reform penal institutions ; and on Saturday they stare at the mess of papers they have n't been able to get to on Friday . On Sunday they rest . And there is a becoming air of humility about these working echelons . These are not ? very definitely not ? bright young men who throw their weight around along with the millions over whose disposition they have such influence . On the contrary , they are full of a sense of responsibility and even despair , a state of mind which comes to those who wield the quite awful power of being able to help some , but not all . No one here claims to know all the answers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I bothered them with questions , " you can do us a favor by telling us what you think of our whole setup . " It is a very hackneyed word , but in some ways the Ford Foundation is really rather inspiring . s o MUCH for the fanfare . There is another and more critical appraisal which can be made . The Ford Foundation , in a year of shakedown cruising , has been as much a disappointment as it has been a success . What with all the splash of wake and theexuberance of its crew , that huge spread of financial canvas has sailed the Ford galleon majestically down the main at a speed that might be estimated at a spanking one knot . For the Ford trustees and officers have found that it is no easy task to play God . God , after all , knows the worth of His possessions . That puts Him one up right away on the men who run the Ford Foundation . And although the Almighty may be inscrutable , there is a Design in the apparently jumbled goings-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , while likened by the easily impressed to an act of Godlike beneficence , has been less flatteringly characterized when it comes to Purposes . Skeptics have compared it with a great lumbering beast with its brains in Pasadena , its vital organs in Detroit , and its legs in New York City ; furthermore they have charged that since a rather elementary nervous system connects the parts , the vital organs do the thinking , the brains do the traveling , and the legs digest all the information . II W HETHER the Ford Foundation is in fact nothing but the largest grab bag in history is a question we will have to leave for the moment . First , let us look at the curiously anomalous financial position in which the Foundation finds itself and at the extraordinary fact that it really does n't know how much it is worth . For the Ford trustees administer an institution whose wealth , although immense , has no real market value . There is , of course , a dollars and cents figure on the balance sheet ? $492,678,254.79 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $68,000,000 petty-cash fund of liquid assets , the Ford Foundation 's wealth consists almost entirely of stock : it owns nearly 90 per cent of the Ford Motor Company ? But the Ford Motor Company has never sold its stock on an exchange and hence the price of its shares on the Foundation 's books ? $135 each ? is purely a tax valuation ; a figure not without meaning but traditionally below market values . It would not surprise me if the trustees would turn down three-quarters of a billion dollars cold cash for the assets on that balance sheet . But what is odd is that this enormous wealth is a kind of imaginary fortune . Since there is no open market for the Ford stock , it is difficult to see how the trustees can sell their assets to diversify principal or spend any substantial part of their capital for a worthwhile project , even if they want to . Odder yet is the fact that the Foundation trustees do not know what their income is going to be . Publicly they have announced that the Foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per year . But like the half-billion dollars of real but unavailable capital , the $25-million figure can not be taken at face value either . Last year was a good year for Ford cars and dividends were high ; the Foundation income for 1950 has been kept a family secret but rumors ( and where there are no facts there are juicy rumors ) have placed it near $100 , - 000,000 . But in another year income from the Ford Company stock could be very small . It could even be nonexistent . It is for this reason that the Foundation is now putting its surplus income into a stabilization fund ? a nest egg into which to dip , if lean years should come . Oddest of all is that while the Foundation will derive virtually all its income from the Ford Motor Company , and while it owns the Motor Company almost lock , stock , and barrel , it has absolutely no voice in the determination of company policies such as the payment of dividends . For the stock it owns is all nonvoting . Should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to have a little price war with General Motors or should it play games with its depreciation policy or should it engage in any number of perfectly sound hard-headed business maneuvers , the Foundation can only accept its fate and hope that it will not find itself too strapped for spending money . It is interesting to speculate on the possibility that Henry Ford II and Benson Ford , both of whom are trustees of the Foundation and directors of the Company , might find themselves wrestling with a situation where as business men their interests would lie in minimizing dividend distribution , while as public benefactors , their interest would lie in having as much money to spend as possible . There is , of course , a reason for this financial straitjacket . The Ford Motor Company has always been a jealously guardedprivate preserve , and while that has provided formidable advantages in the way of secrecy ( Walter Reuther will be pleased to find out more about Ford 's finances when the Foundation starts announcing its income by giving out figures for 1951 ) , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was no alternative for the Fords but to give their money to a foundation ; had their estates not thus been made tax-exempt , it would have been necessary to risk dismembering the empire by selling its stock on the open market in order to pay the huge death duties involved . III B UT financial tangles are the least ; while the Foundation finds itself in the unenviable position of a wealthy but financially incompetent cousin whose affairs are tended by the poorer but sounder-minded members of the family , it is certainly no mere appendage of the Ford family when it comes to programs and purposes . In fact irate Ford dealers have already accused the Foundation of espousing heinous doctrines without regard to their impact on buyers of Mercurys and Lincolns . More important is the critical dismay of many of those who have tried in vain to latch onto some of the Foundation 's money . For while the Ford prospectus covers heaven and earth , the interpretation of that prospectus lies in the hands of the high priests of Pasadena . The attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the institutions who lined up for their philanthropic alms in the full confidence that Ford would go Rockefeller one better . The prospectors have found out that the vast Ford cornucopia disburses its fortune out of the narrow end of its gigantic cone , and that this narrow end seems to have the diameter of a clogged eyedropper . For of all the $23,000 , - 000 which the Foundation has earmarked for expenditure , as of early October less than half had actually been spent . This is probably natural enough in view of the fact that the organization has had no chance to learn while growing , as most big institutions have ; it was born a giant . And furthermore it was not buying assembled merchandise but men 's working abilities , which are much harder to appraise . But at least it seems significant that of the money which has actually been spent , only a spoonful has found its way into the hands of the established educational and welfare institutions of the country . The large expenditures ? the overseas grants , the radio-TV workshop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have by-passed entirely the plans and the pocketbooks of the great majority of colleges , schools , councils , committees , institutes , and organizations who have spent their lives in the very fields in which the Foundation is supposed to be interested . No wonder there is somewhat less than whole-hearted support for the projects which the Foundation in its greater wisdom has selected . In due justice , it must be said that with the publication of the Fords ' wills , the gold rush started ; it was the hottest since the Klondike . Applications have come pouring in at a rate of two hundred to five hundred a week ; they have ranged all the way from distressing stories of personal misery to long printed documents with charts . A few are funny , a sprinkling are mad , most are dead serious . And they all have the common denominator of being expensive . Within a year the sum total of requests for aid ? including a few modest projects without price tag such as converting the Mediterranean into a fresh-water pond and doing something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably have more than paid for the total national debt of the United States . Some four thousand applications , totaling over a quarter of a billion dollars , poured in from universities and colleges ; one university alone put in two hundred separate and distinct projects for consideration ( it wound up with a batting average of .000 ) . One of the Foundation 's officers proposed that the Pasadena headquarters be named Itching Palms . But while there is of course an element of comedy and a trace of indecorousness in this spectacle of gowned dignitaries tripping on their hems as they scramble for the grab bag , there is a more serious side to the free-for-all . For most of the scramblers are people who have spent their working lives trying to do on a smaller scale what the Foundation now proposes to do in bold and massive strokes . It is to be expected that they will scramble ? they should scramble . And if they do not happen to be included in the list of donees , at least they should be able to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes sense . This is just what they do n't . And the criticism one hears is not merely a disagreement about the merits of the projects that have made the grade . That sort of criticism , after all , is the occupational disease of all foundation life ; every disgruntled donee can call a foundation 's pet projects " mere grants of charity " or " ill-coordinated and ineffectual . " But the criticism one does hear is of a different nature and more disturbing . It is a criticism of attitudes rather than projects , and a questioning of whether the Foundation 's programs are in line with its objectives . One finds disquieting testimony to a WeKnow-Better attitude at the top of the Foundation which sits ill with outsiders who think they know something of these problems . " And do they know better ? " snorted one university official . " They talk peace and support cold-war irritants . They talk education and advance ' it in ways that would hardly have the support of more than a minority of the nation 's educators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a garbage-pail program with no real plan behind it . In the meantime there are perfectly good programs under way that are threatened with disaster for lack of funds , good schools which can't. make ends meet , deserving but unspectacular work that needs financing . The Foundation does n't want those . It goes in for the big international splash , the trail-blazing grant that leads God knows where , and for the pet hobby horses of its topkicks . It 's all very discouraging . " B ETwEEN the open-mouthed admiration with which the Ford Foundation was greeted by the professional adulators of all merchant-prince beneficence and the irritation with which it is discussed in some academic circles , there is a considerable gulf . Perhaps it is a measure of the confusion which still exists about the purposes that lie behind the Foundation ? a confusion , by the way , which had its ultimate expression when a lady called up the Pasadena offices and asked if she could arrange for a fitting . Having established the Foundation as a philanthropic institution second to none , Henry Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) did two quite extraordinary things . He arranged for the appointment of " outside " trustees ? people like Karl Compton of MIT and Donald David of the Harvard Business School ? who not only outnumbered the " inside " trustees ( the Ford family ) but who could outvote them . In a word he gave up control over his own Foundation ; a truly spectacular gesture of self-denial and a real avowal of the public nature and responsibility of the Foundation . And having done that , he set up a study group with powers unlimited to tell the trustees what was the very best they could do with the money for the welfare of mankind . In fact he wrote to H. Rowan Gaither , Jr. , who headed the committee : We want to take stock of our existing knowledge , institutions , and techniques in order to locate areas where the problems are most important and where additional efforts toward their solution are most needed . We want the best thought available in the United States as to how this Foundation can most effectively and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For two years the study group grappled with this order . It interviewed a thousand people , put in the equivalent of seven man-years of labor , wrote two books . It had to ; after all , there are many things a foundation can do . It can take an inspiring project and bring it into concrete existence : Carnegie built libraries and started us on the way to having the finest public library system in the world and the Rockefellers built medical centers until we lead the world there , too . A foundation can take a specific evil and blot it out : Rockefeller money obliterated hookworm in the South and the Rosenwald Foundation had a real and lasting impact on the problem of race relations in America . A foundation can play by ear for special talents : witness the Guggenheim fellowships and the Juilliard scholarships . But what the study group said the people needed was not more buildings , institutions , medical help , or housing , important as all these are . What the people needed , said the MAGAZINE study group , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizing and benefiting from the richness of a democratic society ; more understanding of how to live in peace with themselves and with their neighbors . The study group chose five areas where Ford money could do what it thought was the most good , even though the visible return might be very scanty : the establishment of peace , the strengthening of democracy , the strengthening of the economy , the encouragement of education , and the understanding of individual behavior and human relations . The Foundation would have made it a great deal easier for itself had it not accepted the report of the study committee and proceeded to put it into practice . It could have built a playground or two or a hospital here and there and everybody would have applauded and said how wonderful that the rich had such social consciences . But the trustees were not looking for cheap kudos . This was , as they very well knew , money that , save for the provisions of section 101 ( 6 ) of the Internal Revenue Code , belonged to the Treasury and hence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , after all , a generation with less veneration for the sanctity of the fortunes of the very rich . In a real sense the trustees felt called upon to justify the existence of what might have looked like nothing but the biggest tax dodge in history by doing something with the money that was so demonstrably wise and efficacious that no one could construe their motives amiss or say : " What have these people done for welfare that could n't have been done better by the peoples ' own welfare agency ? their government ? " V I T is only after one has taken cognizance of the nobility of its goals and the difficulties of their attainment that one can arrive at some sort of judgment on this big , butter-fingered , eager-eyed child of a foundation . For it is going , as all foundations do , through what Dr. Alan Gregg of the Rockefeller Foundation once called " children 's diseases . " We could spend all day arguing about each project that has been accepted and each one that has been rejected and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end than one man 's opinion as against another 's . The Foundation may well be making hideous mistakes and scattering its money like buckshot , or it may be displaying the rarest of acumen and subtle generalship . There is only one judge of that : time . But while it makes little sense today to criticize the Ford Foundation for acts of omission or commission , it seems perfectly fair to take a long look at the way in which it has gone about its business . An enormous institution , responsible to no one but itself , devoid of all need to show " results , " capable of influencing for better or worse much of our thinking and many of our institutions , must live in an atmosphere of public criticism and public understanding . Here , then , are two questions that I should like to see the Foundation wrestle with : ( 1 ) Can the Foundation cut its ties with Ford ? This is not a question that implies sinister " influences " or casts aspersions on the excellence of the Ford Company management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Foundation itself , for it asks whether any foundation should be in a position where it can not call its own financial shots . A foundation should have complete freedom in the use and disposition of its resources and its income ; and this is manifestly impossible so long as it is tied to a commercial enterprise . I venture to guess , in addition , that in its program to strengthen the American economy , the Foundation will espouse the widest possible distribution of corporate wealth . Where better to begin than in its own back yard ? It is only fair to add that the trustees themselves are acutely aware of the problems which grow out of the tie to Ford . The crux of the question they face is apparently this how can the Ford stock be distributed without running the risk of wrecking the Company ? To try to strengthen the national economy while undermining one of its important units would hardly make much sense . Possibly there is no early way of accomplishing the divorce without undue danger ; yet sooner or later a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation learn to stop , look , and listen ? It did its preliminary planning ? decided upon its general objectives ? only after long and thoughtful study and wide consultation . But since then there has been an apparent tendency toward something that looks very much like arbitrariness . One has an uneasy feeling that too many of the projects can be identified with the well-known intellectual predilections of its top officers . This is natural in the early stages of such an enterprise , but it raises many questions about the future . There is a suspicion that ideas which do not happen to fall in line with the Pasadena brand of " contributory thinking " are given short shrift ? even when these ideas may be firmly held by a great many quite respectable authorities . There is the impression that the Foundation is sympathetic toward the dramatic gesture , at the expense of many workaday organizations which have been plugging away at some of the Foundation 's goals so long that they have lost their glamour . Item : The Foundation has not yet seen fit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country ; none of them quite " fills the bill . " Instead it will set up its own . Item : One of the higher officials of the Foundation sets out on a round-the-world tour to study conditions ? and allots , in his plans , only one month for the expedition . Item : A university president writes to a high official in Pasadena saying that he would like to meet him in New York or elsewhere at his convenience and specifically says that he recognizes that it would be impractical to meet in Pasadena . He receives as answer a note to the effect that it is impossible to meet in Pasadena , period . This sort of behavior naturally instills in the Foundation 's critics a feeling that the thinking in Pasadena is insulated , arrogant , and hurried . This generalization does not apply , so far as I can see , to the men in the lower echelons to whose open-mindedness I have already borne witness ; nor , for that matter , will anyone who knows Paul Hoffman charge him with a lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of remote playing God and a disregard of counsels which may perhaps lack the desired element of " pioneering " because they are tempered with experience . Perhaps the fault can be summarized in saying that the Foundation lacks good public relations ? not in the narrow sense of putting out releases and announcements , but in the deepest sense of inspiring a feeling of good will and sympathetic support from its fellow-workers . One wonders , sometimes , if the Foundation feels it has any fellow-workers . It is true , of course , that too many cooks spoil the broth and that an idea which pleases everybody is apt to be a platitude . The Foundation could hardly keep open house and run its affairs efficiently . But neither can it decree new directions in philanthropy ? with the inevitable effect on the whole trend of institutional activity ? without some larger degree of general participation than the sagesof Pasadena now seem to be willing to admit . Perhaps Julius Rosenwald summed up the difficulties as clearly as anybody . " It is nearly always easier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honestly than to dispose of it wisely . " No institution has tried harder to live up to that challenge than the Ford Foundation . It has intelligence , imagination , and courage . It has hardly begun to function . Its future is before it . With a large dose of humility and perseverance , it may get over its acute growing pains and achieve a magnificently fruitful maturity .
