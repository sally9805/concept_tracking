txt Nobusuke Kiehl , a small man whose protruding upper teeth make him a favorite subject for newspaper cartoonists , is a civil servant by training and an administrative bureaucrat . by instinct . Today he is the Prime Minister of Japan . Michiro Fujiyama is a rotund man with owlish eyes and cherubic expression who spent most of his sixty-odd years as a bustnew man . Today he is Japan 's Foreign Minniter , and he still finds It a bit hard to put aside . in the name of diplomacy , his old habit of speaking bluntly . Moaaburo Suzuki is an old-time socialist who spent most of World War II in a Japanese political prison : Inejiro Asanuma is a former local Tokyo politick= Both now in their middle sixties . neither has ever held an important government post . But between them  --  and often in rivalry  --  they control the political machinery of the Japanese socialistically inclined opposition party . Typical Leaders Yet for all of their differences , all these men have a few things in common . In the old Japan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political power . Today they are typical of the new crop of leaders thrown up by the war and the occupation in whose hands rests the question whether the experiment in democratic , parliamentary government will " take " in modern Japan . And if so , what direction it will take . It 's an important question . as much for the U.S. and the West as for Japan itself . For a democratic Japan , a Western-oriented Japan . is crucial to U.S. foreign policy in the Far East . And despite all the changes that have taken place in the Japanese social , economic and political order in the past decade . a visitor can not escape the feeling that the matter is as yet undecided . Even the Japanese . when they speak of " de-mo-cra-cy. " are prone to add the little word " ka . " which is the spoken Japanese question-mark . In part this uncertainty is due to the fact that democracy is not something to be conjured up on order ; it is something peoples unaccustomed to it must learn slowly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to how Japan can cope with certain basic economic problems . and to the uncertain effects of U.S. policy on those economic problems . Nevertheless . even a brief visitor in this ancient land is impressed by the fact that the Japanese themselves want their new democracy to work and that they would prefer to see it oriented toward those very Western nations with whom they were so lately at war . One strength of this desire is that it is practical , not simply idealistic . The old political order failed : and for a Japanese , failure is the ultimate sin . Thus an inquiring visitor finds very few Japanese interested ' n abstract political discussions about the virtues of democracy . He does find many who hope that Japan will not revert to a government dominated either by the military or by an old-style power clique . They want to bury that past as deeply as possible . Practical Outlook In the same fashion you find few Japanese who are Western-oriented out of a philosophical conviction . You find many ? in government . in business and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's economic and political future is brighter as a member of the Free World . Thus a realistic assessment is that the prospects for Japan . from a Western viewpoint . are good . But realism also requires a measure of the hazards . One of these , which strikes a visitor rather forcibly , is that the Japanese are still trying to learn how to live with this new de-mocra-c5 ' . Their constitution was handed them by their conquerors : their political institutions were borrowed . They have yet to be adapted to the indigenous Japanese ways . Thus in Parliament a debate sometimes degenerates into a riot because selfdiscipline as a substitute for Imposed discipline has not yet been grafted onto the newly found freedom of expression . Conversely ( and perhaps as a consequence ) it is not unusual to hear Japanese in the government , or Japanese intellectuals , talk about the need for more applied discipline as a cure for " irresponsibility " in Parliament or in the press . In other words , Western clothes do not yet quite fit naturally on people accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discouraging . An American will be charitable about these difficulties if he will remember that we too occasionally had physical violence after Congressional debates , as well as some other troubles while learning to ' live in a democracy . Moreover , It Is true that the new political leaders have tried to apply one Japanese principle , that a bamboo bends so that It will not break . Prime Minister Kiehl has saved himself several times by refusing to push an issue too far , a tactic not unknown in countries more experienced in democratic politics . The opposition party , as sometimes also happens elsewhere , has also been held back on occasion because it was divided within itself . So a visitor . presuming a bit on a short acquaintance , can feel some optimism about the ability of the Japanese to develop a democratically shaped government  --  provided that the new democracy is not subjected to too great a political strain too soon . But that possibility is certainly another hazard , and a hazard that comes from without as well as from within . ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any governmental system is whether it meets the nation 's needs . And one essential need of Japan at the moment is to find greater trading possibilities ; Japan must trade to live . Therefore it is likely to follow that a failure to meet the trade problem would put a very heavy strain on the present democratic , Western-oriented government . U.S. Influence Many Japanese think it is being strained now by U.S. policy . For on the one hand the U.S. seems bent on curtailing rather than encouraging more Japanese exports to America .. and on the other U.S. influence is being applied to discourage Japanese trade with what ? the Japanese think is a great potential market in mainland China . Whatever the merits of this view it 's one the U.S. can not afford to underestimate . No other foreign policy question keeps the owlish Mr. Fujiyama quite so busy or provides so much political ammunition for the two opposition leaders , Mr. Suzuki and Mr. Asanuma . And as time goes on . as the expanding Japanese economy becomes more pressed for markets . U.S. tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become more and more a straining political issue in Japanese politics . For the time being . this strain is not too great . Japan right now is an exceedingly prosperous country . at least by Asian standards . and so while Mr. Suzuki and Mr. Asanuma can go tripping off to Red China they can not turn the ' lure of the China trade into a politically irresistible temptation . Moreover , Japan is beginning to develop its political system in such a way that it can bend greatly without breaking . Its new lead . ership as represented by such men as Mr. Kishi and Mr. Fujiyama , the old civil servant and the former business man . is slowly acquiring the political skill necessary to operate in a politically free society . And this new leadership is trying rather earnestly to keep Japan pointed politically toward the West . All the same , a visitor here who asks the question " de-mo-cra-cy kar is never unaware that he is on the edge of Asia . And that he is among a people who. if they are ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as freely as they borrow them .
