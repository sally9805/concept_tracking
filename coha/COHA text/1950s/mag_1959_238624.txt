The piano literature for one hand can pretty well be numbered on the fingers of two . Scriabin , Brahms . Ravel and Strauss all took a shot at it , along with such moderns as Benjamin Britten and Leos Janacek. * The rest of the left-hand repertory is pretty much what the trade calls " knitting music . " But a platoon of composers in Holland last week was hard at work on some new and surprisingly engaging left-hand pieces to be played by a recent recruit to the field : 45-year-old Dutch Pianist Cor de Groot . <P> Until last summer . Pianist de Groot was a two-handed recitalist of solid international reputation . Then , during a recording session , he felt a sudden cramp in his right hand , was barely able to finish playing Liszt 's Melancholy Waltz . Although X rays disclosed no abnormality in the hand , neither cortisone nor treatment by a neurologist was able to restore full use to De Groot 's fingers . He set about learning what left-hand compositions he could find , soon decided that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> At that point , De Groot 's friend , composer Juriaan Andriessen , announced that he was going to compose a piece for the left hand . As the news spread , other composers volunteered to do the same . Virtually every top Dutch composer is working on a piece for De Groot to be finished before February , in time for a new radio series . The new works will nearly triple the left-hand repertory . <P> In the meantime , De Groot is filling out his concert season with old standbys , e.g. , the Brahms version of Bach 's Violin Chaconne , which he played last week to critical huzzahs on the Dutch radio . He is also rearranging pieces by Debussy , Grieg , Liszt , Rachmaninoff . And if the day should ever come when he exhausts both the old and the new repertories , he sees an almost endless future in recording . Under the name " Guy Sherwood , " for instance , he appears in a radio series on which he plays numbers such as Kitten on the Keys , for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right-hand part ( played with the left hand ) . When the whole thing is glued together , De Groot sounds like his old two-handed self playing like sixty . <P> <P> * Although some left-hand pieces are written as mere musical oddities , most are commissioned or written by handicapped pianists , e.g. , Hungary 's famed Geza Zichy ( 1849-1924 ) , who lost his arm in a hunting accident , but developed into such a virtuoso that he played three-hand recitals with Liszt ; Vienna-born Paul Wittgenstein , who lost an arm in World War I , and commissioned Ravel 's Concerto for the Left Hand , two works by Richard Strauss , Britten 's Diversions on a Theme .
