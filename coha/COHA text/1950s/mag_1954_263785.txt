At dusk one day last February , a middleaged , professorial sort of man opened the door of his neat , middle-class Frankfurt apartment to a stranger . " Are you Herr Okolovich ? " asked the caller , in perfectly accented German . " I am . " " Then I must talk to you privately . It is most important . " Herr Okolovich ushered the stranger in and offered him a cup of tea . It was brusquely declined . A moment later , switching from German to Russian , the stranger told Herr Okolovich his na.me and business : " I am Captain Khokhlov of the MVD , and I have been ordered to kill you . " <P> Last week , before a battery of microphones , cameras and newsmen in a U.S. Government office at Bonn , Captain Khokhlov , 31 , told why he had failed to MVD CAPTAIN KHOKHLOV ( WITH FAMILY ) With poison and conscience . carry out his murder assignment . The stated reason was simple enough : " A conflict between Soviet intelligence , which tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience " ; but the facts leading up to it made a story that sounded like a collaboration of Graham Greene and E. Phillips Oppenheim . <P> As a young man in Moscow and a dutiful member of the Young Communist League Organization in the late ' 30s , Nikolai Khokhlov was only interested in becoming an actor and eventually a movie director . He played a few bits in Russian plays and movies , and even made himself a small reputation on the variety stage as an " artistic whistler . " When the Nazis invaded Russia , he volunteered for frontline duty , but was rejected because of bad eyes . As the Nazis drew near to Moscow , however , Khokhlov was recruited , along with many other young actors and artists , by the NKVD ( the MVD of the time ) to fight a rear-guard guerrilla action in case the city fell . From then on , he was in the secret police to stay . <P> Dirty Missions . Under a host of different names and forged passports , he was sent from one European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skill to pass himself off as a native . In 1943 , by his own account , he directed the assassination of German Gauleiter Wilhelm Kube in Minsk . After a hasty cram course in German , he was planted in a camp for German P.W.s . In 1947 , he was granted Rumanian citizenship under the name Stanislaw Lewandowski . But for all his success and all his skill , Khokhlov was far from happy as an undercover agent . " I got into Soviet intelligence when my country was at war , " he explained last week . " At that time , I considered it my patriotic duty . . . but the war ended , and I was used not only for matters of defense of my country but also for missions which had nothing to do with defense . They were dirty missions . " <P> Once Khokhlov tried to quit the MVD but failed . Another time he refused to undertake a mission involving murder . His bulwark and supporter in such bold actions , according to Khokhlov , was his wife Yanina . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tears formed in Khokhlov 's eyes last week as he talked of her : " She helped me to understand that there exists in the world real decency , and that there is such a thing as purity of motive . "
