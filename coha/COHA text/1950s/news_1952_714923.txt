txt Mayor Impellittesi declared war yesterday against City Council President Rudolph Halley . At an open meeting of the Board of Estimate the Mayor announced he was serving notice on all heads of city departments and agencies under his jurisdiction " not to answer the telephone when the President of the Council calls up . " " I have repeatedly said in the past that the President of the Council is not the Commissioner of Investigation , " he told his colleagues on the Board of Estimate . " In order to put a stop to distortions and misunderstandings , I have directed all my commissioners not to answer telephone calls from the President of the Council . " If he wants information about anything on the Board of Estimate calendar , that will be all right , but , so that there will be no misunderstanding or distortion and for your own protection , you will ask him to put in writing any requests he may make for . information . " Mr. Halley retorted : " This is truly an astonishing action for the Mayor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came as Mr. Halley was seeking to ascertain the facts about an award by the Board of Transportation of a gasoline supply contract to a con // cern that was not the lowest bidder . Mr. Impellitterl made it clear that the three commissioners of the Board of Transportation were I among those directed " not to aniswer the telephone " when Mr. HalI ley or any of his office staff called ' for information . He made it clear also that his remarks were for the benefit of the public . Friction between the Mayor and Mr. Halley became evident even before the fuel contract matter came up for discussion . Earlier in the meeting Mr. Halley declared he would not vote on two items dealing with the Queens sewer situation unless he received a copy of the full report submitted to the Mayor last week by Investigation Commissioner James A. Shells . " The Board of Estimate is now being called upon to appropriate city funds in connection with the Queens sewer matter , " Mr. Halley said . " I now ask that every member of this board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mayor Cites Distribution The Mayor replied : " Copies of the report have been sent to the Controller Lazarus Joseph , the District Attorney in Queens Vincent A. Quinn , the Borough President of Queens James A. Lundy and the Mayor 's Committee on Management Improvement . They are the parties who must take action of one kind or another . " " Nevertheless , " Mr. Halley replied , " this board is now called upon to vote city money in connection with this matter . I now ask you if you will supply each member of this board with a copy of the Shells report and tell you that I will refrain from voting on this matter unless I am provided with a copy . " " You may ask for it in writing and I will give the matter consideration , " the Mayor replied . " I want it now in order to act with full knowledge on the calen-I dar item before us , " Mr. Halley replied . " I wo n't vote unless I have a copy of that report . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The board then proceeded , with , Mr. Halley casting the only negative vote , to appropriate $135,669 for equipment , supplies and ma- terials declared by Mr. Lundy to be necessary for the prosecution of his investigation of the Laurelton sewer construction project in Queens . Mr. Halley again was the sole ' dissenter when the board referred to Corporation Counsel Denis M. Hurley , Mr. Joseph and Budget Director Abraham D. Beanie a request by Mr. Lundy for the " necessary " funds with which to repair the allegedly faulty Laurelton sewer built by contractor Victor Clemente . Mr. Lundy has indicated he plans to have the job done by another contractor on a cost-plus basis under the direction of his own engineering staff . The Mayor 's directive to his commissioners and their aides to ignore Mr. Halley 's requests for information as well as requests by members of Mr. Halley 's staff came as a surprise to his colleagues on the Board of Estimate . They sat in silence as the Mayor made his pronouncement and Mr. Halley protested that " the Mayor is trying to place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outburst was no surprise , however , to members of the Mayor 's official family , who on many occasions since Mr. Halley took office have been asked by him ormember members of his staff for information on various city matters . The City Charter gives Mr. Halley no investigative powers and , no right to subpoena witnesses orgy documents . He has conducted several investigations on his own , ' with the help of his small office staff . It is no secret at City Hall that his efforts to obtain information from city department and agency heads and their subordinates have not met with spectacular success . The Mayor injected a political note into the situation after Mr. Halley had expressed his shocked amazement at the " gag " order . " You have a very effective outside staff working for your election in 1953 , " the Mayor declared , his face flushed with anger . " I 'm doing my job , " Mr. Halley retorted . " If that makes me guilty of playing politics , then I am proud to be guilty of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now seems that the city has two governments , the one that is included and the one that is excluded . As I told my colleagues during the meeting , my office gets a copy of the calendar on Monday , the executive meeting is on , Wednesday and the regular meeting the following day . It is going to be difficult , under the Mayor 's directive , for me to get my calendar in shape . " The Mayor 's resentment at Mr. Halley 's investigative activities burst its bounds during the discussion of a request by the Board of Transportation for approval of its award of a $603,408 gasoline purchase contract to the Morania Oil Companny , Inc. , which was not the low bidder , but which met the low bid after the low bidder was disqualified . The disqualification was based upon the expressed inability of the low bidder to deliver its gasoline in tank trucks equipped with meters that issued a printed ticket showing the ' mount of fuel delivered . Subway Plans Protested At the morning session of the board fifteen busloads of residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that none of the city 's contemplated subway ' construction in their borough would be on elevated structures . The promise was made by Mayor Impellitteri after Brooklyn civic and political leaders had argued . that construction of elevated lines would " blight " their residential areas . They contended that real estate values had been depressed by reports that some of the forthcoming transit lines would be elevated . Conforming to the announcement of its intention mate on Tuesday after a ? special executive session on transit , the board put off until Dec. 18 further consideration of the proposed $500,000 , - 000 subway construction program . This includes the projected $220 , - 000,000 Second Avenue subway and the Brooklyn extensions . Later in the board meeting Controller Joseph said it was important to inform the public that the Board of Estimate appropriated for but did not award contracts for construction jobs . He made the remark as the board approved an authorization of bonds totaling $20,573,000 for construction of the Elmhurst General Hospital in an area bounded by Broadway , Forty-first and Baxter Avenues and Seventy-eighth Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including 154 for psychiatric cases , twenty for psychosomatic cases and the remainder for general patients . The board passed a local law enacted by the City Council fixing the hours between 7 A. M. and 91 P. M. for the burning of refuse in ' incinerators.
