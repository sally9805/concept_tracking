One hundred thousand Colombians paraded in Bogot last week to honor their new President , Lieut . General Gustavo Rojas Pinilla , who exactly a month before had overthrown the unpopular regime of Laureano Gmez . The five-hour parade was extraordinary : instead of marching , the people rode in 1,500 buses , 2,300 taxis and 3,000 trucks ( thus paralyzing normal transportation in the capital and for miles around ) . Beaming down from the balcony of the presidential palace , Rojas could see that the buses and taxis were arranged by reds , yellows and blues to form enormous Colombian flags . Bands played , and at one point all the drivers in the whole 16-mile-long cavalcade blew their horns in a raucous , mechanical viva . <P> Partly , Colombians cheer easygoing General Rojas because he is such a welcome contrast to the gloomy and oppressive Gmez . Partly , they like his inspiring promises : " The armed forces will continue being . . . the jealous and disinterested guardians of the democratic survival of our institutions . " Partly , they approve his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Ended the civil war between the Government police and Liberal guerrillas by offering amnesty and reconciliation to the guerrillas . Hundreds have surrendered , and more give up daily . <P> Returned to their lands other hundreds of ex-guerrillas and guerrillas ' victims who had fled to cities . <P> Undertaken , as " general to general , " to solve the stubborn dispute with Peru 's President , Manuel Odria , over the asylum granted by Colombia to Victor Haya de la Torre. * <P> Dropped a Gmez scheme to write a totalitarian constitution , and named Liberals as well as Conservatives to a commission which will refurbish the present law . <P> But martial law has not been lifted , as the editors of Gmez ' El Siglo found out last week . Angered by a tactless editorial which seemed to take Peru 's side in the Haya controversy , Rojas Pinilla closed El Siglo for a day . Censorship was also strict , though seemingly impartial , at other papers . Rojas has promised to return a measure of press freedom , after working out a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less onerous than Gmez ' capricious prior censorship , because it will put the rules down in black &; white , but it will still be censorship . <P> <P> * Left-wing ( but antiCommunist ) leader of Peru 's workers and Indians . A hunted man after Odria 's 1948 revolution , he took refuge in Colombia 's Lima embassy 4 years ago . Subsequently , the World Court ruled confusingly that " asylum was not justified , " but that Colombia " is not obliged to deliver " Haya to Peru . To this day , Haya has not left the embassy , which is completely encircled by Odria 's troops .
