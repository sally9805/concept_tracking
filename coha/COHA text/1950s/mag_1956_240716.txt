ABEL SANCHEZ &; OTHER STORIES ( 216 pp. ) - Miguel de Unamuno - Henry Regnery ( $1.25 ) . <P> <P> One of the doughtiest soldiers of the modern world of ideological civil war is too obscurely defined in the U.S. ken . He is-or was-Don Miguel de Unamuno , twice rector of and twice expelled from the University of Salamanca , * who brought to recent letters a Spanish taste for macabre conundrums about death : " One day we shall all die , even the dead . " <P> Basque-born Unamuno had a Spanish flair for paradox-he insisted that the fictional Don Quixote was a greater and a realer man than Don Quixote 's creator , Cervantes . This kind of jugglery between the balloons of fiction and the cannonballs of fact made Unamuno an enigmatic figure-and in Catholic , reactionary Spain , a suspect and controversial one . In 1891 , when he was 27 , he became professor of Greek at Salamanca , and was appointed rector ten years later . He stoutly rejected any obligation to impose coherence on his thought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . He translated Marxist books , tilted at the windmills of Spanish society , and at the same time , in his books engaged in what was essentially theological speculation . <P> Critics sometimes point to his Tragic Sense of Life as one of the works that inspired the existentialist movement in Paris after World War II . Influenced by the moral austerity of Ibsen and the mystical ruminations of Danish **25;17896;TOOLONG Sren Kierkegaard , the book argued the toss between faith and reason in a way that could not fail to cause offense to the Spanish hierarchy . In Unamuno 's picture of man , man 's worst friend was his dogma . He argued : flesh-and-blood man must assert his identity in the face of death . This seemed to leave God out of the picture , so in 1914 , with an assist from a touchy government , he was forced out of his rectorship . <P> Self-Exiled . Unamuno continued to teach at the university , and politically he worked for the Republicans against the monarchy , but when Primo de Rivera 's dictatorship took over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dictator forced him into exile in the Canary Islands . Although amnesty was granted a few months later , he exiled himself to Paris . By this time , his was the greatest literary name in the Hispanic world , and after Primo de Rivera 's death , he returned to Salamanca with national acclaim . But Don Miguel was really a Don Quixote , and his Quixote 's genius for glory and self-destruction led him to gibe constantly at the liberal republic , to salute the Francoist rebels in 1936 , and , characteristically , to live just long enough to regret it . " He alone is truly wise who is conscious of his madness , " he said in a lecture at Oxford . " I am conscious of my madness ; therefore I am truly wise . " Thus he lived and performed , an honored enigma . At one time , his work and his person seemed to have the embroidered smile of a saint on a religious banner ; at another , the proud sneer of a Spanish beggar .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
