Never before had one man welcomed so many to a housewarming . Showing off the renovated White House to a TV audience of some ten million , President Harry Truman was dapper and chipper in a light blue double-breasted suit . He also appeared more at ease than the three network announcers ( CBS 's Walter Cronkite , ABC 's Bryson Rash , NBC 's Frank Bourg-holtzer ) who took turns accompanying him on his rounds . <P> The Truman tour covered the rooms that are ordinarily opened to the public ( that morning 7,263 people filed through the White House for a first-hand look at what the TV audience saw that afternoon ) . As a guide should , the President spiced his information with folksy stories . The best was about Texas ' late Senator Morris ( 18th Amendment ) Sheppard and Calvin Coolidge . Once , at a White House breakfast , Sheppard was surprised to find the Coolidge collie barking at his elbow . Coolidge explained that the dog wanted Sheppard 's sausage , so the Senator gave it to him . Concluded Truman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheppard did n't get another sausage . " <P> In the East Room , the President sat down and played a few bars that were later identified by daughter Margaret as being from Mozart 's Ninth Sonata. * <P> The three networks had assembled seven cameras and nearly 100 technicians to put the show on the air . There was no script-only a brief " walk-through " rehear sal . Except for bad timing ( the hour-long show ran twelve minutes short ) , there were surprisingly few blunders . In a week marked by political rebuffs on the steel issue ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , the President could console himself with the knowledge that , as a TV master of ceremonies , he had given at least one outstanding performance . <P> <P> *Pianist Truman violated no union rules by playing for a network audience . In 1949 James Caesar Petrillo , president of the American Federation of Musicians , gave him an honorary membership card .
