Four and a half centuries have passed since Roman archaeologists uncovered the famed Laocon sculpture , a huge , powerful work of marble showing the death of a Trojan priest and his two sons ( who were sentenced by Athena to be crushed by serpents because Laocon had warned against the Trojan horse ) . Placed in the Vatican , the Laocon group profoundly impressed Michelangelo , and through him shaped the art of the High Renaissance . But even the Vatican experts have long believed that their Laocon is only a copy of the original . Last week archaeologists the world over were excited by the possibility that the original Laocon group , done about the time of Christ , had been found . <P> The discovery was made by a young Italian engineer named Erno Bellante , who was building a road past the town of Sperlonga ( pop . 3,000 ) by the Tyrrhenian Sea . Taking time off from his prosaic work , Amateur Archaeologist Bellante set workmen to digging inside the grotto of Tiberius ( who reigned from 14 A.D. to 37 A.D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tiberius ' famed Villa Spelunca ( Cave Villa ) . * Beneath six inches of limy earth , one of Bellante 's men struck a marble fragment shaped like the calf of a human leg , about twice lifesize . The diggers dug on to more than 400 pieces of polished marble . <P> Called in to study the find Giulio Jacopi , director of Rome 's Museo del Terme , a top archaeological authority , examined the fragments and made an excited announcement : on some of them he found the Greek inscription , " Done by Agesander , Polydorus and Athenodorus , " the father and sons generally credited with the original Laocon group . Said Jacopi : " That violently twisted neck . . . that great marble foot . . . the veins on that huge hand . . . the serpent is monstrous ... I believe it is Laocon . " <P> Only a third of the cave had been excavated by last week , and the torso of Laocon himself was still among the missing pieces . To complicate matters , the citizens of Sperlonga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thinking of tourist-trade possibilities , they rolled a five-ton rock before the cave entrance , dug a moat to frustrate approaching trucks . Still , having logic , culture and Cops all on his side , Jacopi was determined to get the entire cave excavated and the fragments transported to Rome , where they can be expertly examined and reassembled to determine whether they are , indeed , the original Laocon . <P> <P> * From which comes the contemporary word for cave explorers , spelunkers.
