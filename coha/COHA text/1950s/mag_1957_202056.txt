Japan , which leads all Asian nations in imitating the West , has lately acquired both a lost generation and a flaming youth . Currently , the symbol of both is a girl with waist-length black hair , cat 's eyes and a fox smile who could be seen last week on the stage of Osaka 's Kitano Theater . As she closed her eyes , and with hips swaying began to sing ( in alternating English and Japanese verses ) an excruciatingly off-key version of Banana Boat Song , her quivering fans rose from their seats and screamed with delight . At 18 Michiko Hamamura is touted , more or less correctly , as " the hottest property in Japanese show business . " <P> " She sings , " an unkind critic has said of Michiko , " but not well . Her fans are there to look , not listen . " Michiko 's looks have sold 100,000 copies of her first Victor recording ( Banana Boat Song , Venezuela ) in a single month , and have touched off a deluge of fan letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she strikingly resembles-she has become the darling of the intelligentsia , who have celebrated her in ponderous prose . Says one literary critic : " Her primitive songs match men 's desire to escape the confused mechanism of today 's living . " Says another : " She is like a woman who rebels against society and fulfills her human desires . " <P> Michiko shot to her present eminence by a maneuver familiar to Hollywood : posing in the seminude . The daughter of an Osaka metal-shop owner , she arrived in Tokyo when she was 15 seeking a singing career , but was bluntly told by the first recording company she went to that she could not sing . Nevertheless , she got singing engagements in U.S. Army camps , picked up a smattering of English , and went on the nightclub circuit . There Photographer Tateyuki Nakamura spotted her , persuaded her to pose in black silk stockings and little else . The photograph , when it appeared in a magazine , was enough to start the Michiko boom . <P> Michiko , who now lives with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slightly jaundiced view of her sudden success : " I do n't know what 's different or good about me . " Nevertheless , she has more offers for theater dates than she can handle , has just been signed for a movie . " She has a sort of refined wildness , " says one producer . For all her highly publicized sex appeal ( " Sensational ! Untamed ! " ) , Michiko has more female fans than male , chiefly because Japanese men prefer their women more submissive , get nervous at the thought of untamed flaming youth . " What she will do or say next , " said one apprehensive Japanese admirer , " only God knows . "
