txt If a company engaged in contract bargaining with a union were to close its washrooms , shut off the heat and turn down the lights in the plant , the National Labor Relations Board would quickly hold management guilty of harassing its employes and thus failing to bargain in good faith . The Supreme Court has before it exactly that same kind of case  --  with some reverse . English ? to it . It has agreed to decide whether a union , during bargaining negotiations , can , in " good faith , " harass the company . The N.L.R.B. was consistent in its view ; it said a union ca n't . But the District of Columbia Court of Appeals overruled the N.L.R.B. and said that it is quite all right for a union to order slowdowns , walkouts and refusals to work while the bargaining is going on . There is no reason to conclude , the Court said . that this sort of harassment does n't fit properly into the pattern of good faith in negotiating contracts . The case resulted from wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago . The Personal Products Corporation willingly sat down to talk about the issues . But it soon found itself , the N.L.R.B. said . " drastically affected " by the workers ' tactics during the negotiations which curtailed the company 's production and disrupted its operations . Now there is no. question that a union empowered to bargain for employes of any company has a legal right to call a strike if the union leaders think a strike will benefit them more than bargaining over wages . But does n union have a right to demand that wages be paid by the company while the union engages in harassing tactics which injure the company  --  and do these things in the name of " good faith ? " The responsibility to bargain in good faith is just as necessary to the proper conduct of labor relations as is the right of men to band together and bargain ? collectively . And despite the ruling of the Appeals Court , the law certainly never meant that good faith was to be observed on only one side of the bargaining table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
