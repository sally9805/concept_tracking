txt Governor Rockefeller is emerging from his taxation battle with a substantial victory for principle . Some concessions have had to be made , both as to income taxes and as to budget . Some of these are justified and a change for the better . Wiser " economies " than some of those proposed in the budget revision could have been found . But the compromise does not seriously , if at all , impair the fundamental Rockefeller determination to check the headlong rush to borrowing ; to find a way to return as promptly as possible to payus-we-go ; to bring the people to a realization that more government spending must be matched with more taxation . The Democratic party , which has opposed this program , should , at this stage , take stock of itself in candid inventory . From the very beginning of this legislative session in early January it has taken an irresponsible position on fiscal matters . This- continued yesterday with Michael H. Prendergast , the Democratic state chairman , making his usual demagogic appeal , again calling the Rockefeller tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage-earners who will " carry home smaller pay checks " and demanding " one final surge of public protest " to " insure the people 's victory against the poor man 's tax . " While Mr. Prendergast has been calling for " economy " in state government , the Democratic State Controller , Arthur Levitt , has been making speeches calking for more state aid to education , while borrowing millions of dollars in tax-anticipation notes to finance previougly voted state aid to education and in bond-issue funds for State University and other construction . In one breath he has been complaining that the Rockefeller budget was still not a pay-as-we-go plan and in the next breath criticizing pay-as-we-go as a policy unfair to the taxpayer . Senator Zaretzki and Assemblyman Travia , the Democratic leaders and both from New York City , put on a tear-jerker television show , dramatizing loss of milk , shirts and shoes by wageearners taxed poor . Democrats even weep for the sportsmen who will have to pay $2 a year more for a hunting-fishing license . Former Governor Harriman , on the eve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by saying he was against lowering income  --  tax exemptions and thought the Rockefeller administration had underestimated its revenues . In view of this steady drumfire of Democratic opposition to the Rockefeller program how can the ? party leaders from New York City expect from the State Legislature a charitable , sympathetic understanding If Mayor Wagner 's budget and taxation problem ? Yet we find Senator Zaretzki , after the Republicans have decided to reduce a new increase in state aid to New York City from $15,000,000 to $5,000,000 in a general budget cut , defending the Governor and saying ; " He has tried to be These other fellows wo n't let him . They want to divide New York City from the rest of the state * * * . " Well , it is New York City Democrats by their refusal to furnish a single vote to help balance the Rockefeller budget who " divide New York City from the rest of the state . " Their excursion into extreme , irresponsible partisanship , indulging in misrepresentation of the Governor 's tax program while craving understanding of New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political luxury , a $10,000,000 loss in state aid . The Democratic leadership in this state must learn that to get fair treatment it will have to earn respect by being fair itself . Its 1959 record , opposing honest budgeting at Albany , has been a shoddy performance .
