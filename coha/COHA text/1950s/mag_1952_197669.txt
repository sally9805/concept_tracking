As the army officers who rule Venezuela had planned it , last week 's election was supposed to be a polite show of public approval , making the country look democratic enough to be a suave , suitable host at the tenth Inter-American Conference of nations next year . Instead , the military junta suffered a stunning defeat-then gave an amazing demonstration of how to break promises , kick democracy in the teeth , and cling to power by force . <P> The election was called to select a congress which would write Venezuela a new constitution and choose a President . To insure victory , the junta months ago planted a government party , lovingly fertilized with treasury money . The only opposition permitted by the junta came from minority parties : the Democratic Republican Union ( U.R.D. ) and the Christian Socialists ( nicknamed Copei ) . But with a fourth of the 2,000,000 votes counted , U.R.D. ( which had never polled more than 55,000 votes since its founding in 1946 ) was leading the government 294,000 to 147,000 , with Copei close behind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news indicated that the 2-to-1 ratio held good . <P> The Official Returns . Consternation seized green Miraflores Palace , the seat of the government . Junta Boss Colonel Marcos Prez Jimnez used the confusion to shuck off the other two members of the junta , Colonel Luis Felipe Llovera Pez , Minister of Interior , and Germn Suarez Flamerich , the mousy professor whom the colonels had propped up as President . After two days , Prez Jimnez got the signed support of Chief of Staff Felix Moreno , and went on the air to declare himself President . He announced baldly that " correct " election returns gave the government a clear victory . Then he ordered the arrest of all U.R.D. officials . <P> Prez Jimnez ' first crisis arose swiftly . Storekeepers , newsmen , students , and some of the workers for the great oil companies went on a protest strike . He hit back by closing schools through Christmas and threatening to cut off labor 's social benefits . " Violence , " huffed Prez Jimnez , " accomplishes nothing . " <P> A Conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out to be such a grievous surprise to the junta ? Information smuggled out through the censorship indicated that the fiasco was engineered deliberately by Alberto Carnevali , underground commander of Accin Democrtica , the majority party which was booted from power and outlawed by the junta four years ago . Carnevali had kissed off the election as a hopeless farce . He had advised A.D. men to go to the polls , as the law requires , but cast blank ballots . But gradually , through A.D.-de-coded government telegrams , he deduced that the junta would rely for victory on pre-election bribes and threats , and would actually allow a secret ballot . <P> Out through clandestine radio transmitters went new orders to A.D. members : to try to beat the junta , vote for Copei in two conservative regions , and for U.R.D. everywhere else . That was where the totally unexpected landslide of U.R.D. votes apparently came from . It was true that Prez Jimnez was not yet unhorsed . But through his clumsy seizure of the presidency , he had placed himself and Venezuela further than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
