The first few days after the U.S. went into Korea , Americans experienced an immense feeling of relief : at last something had been done . By last week , as G.I.s were fighting doggedly to maintain their foothold on the peninsula ( see above ) , much of that feeling had been transformed into the grimmer realization that far more remained to be done . <P> Korea was only a tiny appendix to a vast , Red land mass that stretched from the Arctic to the Gulf of Tonkin . Anywhere on its periphery a dozen more Koreas could flare up tomorrow . Washington seemed resigned to the defensive-to wait for the Communists to start the fire , and then to rush a U.S. fire brigade to the scene at the last minute . <P> Was this really all the U.S. could do ? <P> The Winds of Power . It was not . There were signs that the U.S. did not know its own potential strength . All too many Washington policymakers seemed paralyzed by a form of intellectual defeatism which holds that the U.S. has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are an easy prey to Communist blandishments . There was important evidence last week that , on the contrary , the U.S. has tremendous opportunities to win and organize friends in Asia . <P> Most significant item of evidence was an intelligence report received in Washington about the attitude of the Chinese Communists scattered throughout the countries of Southeast Asia . These Chinese , mostly shrewd traders and businessmen , are barometrically sensitive to the prevailing winds of power . When the Communists won in China , many of these Chinese nationals jumped on the Red bandwagon ; by last week they were jumping off again . Pictures of Communist Boss Mao Tse-tung were significantly disappearing from shop windows , applications for Communist Party membership dwindled . <P> This change of heart was caused by the firm U.S. action in Korea , and the U.S. pledge to defend Formosa . The lesson was clear and simple : Asians , even more than Europeans , have no use for friends who are not strong . By being strong , the U.S. can win Asia 's friendship ; the U.S. can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartening stand it is making against Communism in Korea . <P> The Suggestions . What , specifically , can the U.S. do ? Among the most plausible suggestions heard last week : <P> Dispatch some firemen before the fire starts , i.e. , send really strong military missions-and possibly U.S. troops-to Asian danger spots . Purpose : to help local governments lick Communist rebellion , to train , supply and lead local armies . <P> Form an Asian high command for these forces , headed by General Douglas MacArthur and including Asians from each country involved . <P> Prepare a peace with Japan , enabling that country to resume trade with Southeast Asia and to maintain an army . <P> Recruit from the vast reservoir of American brains and guts a force of men willing to serve their country abroad , under rigorous conditions , put them through tough , practical training , and send them as political and economic advisers not only to governments but to individual communities in Asia . Put at their disposal an ECA-like fund for practical , short-to-medium-range aid and construction .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
