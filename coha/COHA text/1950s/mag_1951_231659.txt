When Editor Michael Straight of the New Republic picked up his telephone in Washington one morning last week , London was on the wire . His caller was his old friend Kingsley Martin , editor of the New Statesman and Nation . Editor Martin was in a high huff about a " rather dirty trick , " to wit , the liberal New Republic , which had long seen eye to eye with the New Statesman , had turned on Fellow-Liberal Martin in a most unpleasant manner . <P> The attack on the New Statesman was written by Richard Strout , Washington correspondent for the Christian Science Monitor , and briefly U.S. correspondent for the New Statesman during a period when , as he said , he was " unfamiliar with its prejudices . " Wrote Strout : " There is something uncanny in the way New Statesman dispatches from all over the world . . . converge ultimately on the faults of the U.S. . . . Doubts arise sometimes as to whether the New Statesman is not merely following the party line . This hardly seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War &; Peace . The evidence , said Strout , included Martin 's favorite contention that the U.S. is trying to bring on World War III ; that General MacArthur disobeyed United Nations directives when he crossed the 38th parallel in Korea . Martin bad also stated that Red China had been promised that MacArthur would not cross the parallel . Said Strout : there is no evidence that either of these statements is true . In truth , Strout added this week , the New Statesman itself " has encouraged the spread of the war by enlisting sympathy for the Chinese aggressors . " <P> Strout 's crudest cut was a repetition of the charge ( TIME , Feb. 26 ) , that Martin was really Britain 's Bertie McCormick . " Different as the publishers are in some respects , " wrote Strout , " they share a furious self-rectitude , a fine ability to raise everybody 's blood-pressure and a loathing for American foreign policy . " <P> Last week Martin followed up his telephone call to Straight with a signed rebuttal in the New Statesman and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tarradiddle . " Martin was obviously not a Communist because he had been " frequently . . . denounced by the Soviets as various kinds of a Fascist beast , " he wrote . And had n't the New Statesman been denied a correspondent in Moscow ? As for MacArthur , said Martin in his best non sequitur fashion , had n't Americans criticized Britain 's Colonel Blimps ? Furthermore , " American generals ... do n't disguise their view that we in Britain may be expendable . " <P> Next Enemy . Martin dropped one admission that helped explain the New Statesman 's line : " Today the center of capitalist power has moved from London to Washington , and Socialists ' criticism must also move from London to Washington . " In short , for left-wingers of Martin 's stripe , with capitalism on the run in England , the next enemy is not Communism but capitalism in the U.S.
