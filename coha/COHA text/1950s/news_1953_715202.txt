txt Early on the morning of the inaugural , in his hotel suite , General Eisenhower wrote a prayer with which he began his inaugural address , asking all to bow with him . It follows : " We stand here , at this moment , my future associates in the executive branch of the government Join me in beseech . Ing that Thou will make full and complete our dedication to the service of the people in this throng and their fellow citizens everywhere , " Give us , we pray , the power to discern clearly right from wrong and allow all our works and actions to be governed thereby and by the tans of this land . " Especially we pray that our concern shall be for all the people , regardless of station , race , or calling , May cooperation be permitted and be the mutual aim of those who , under the concept of our constitution , hold to differing political beliefs , so that all may work for the good of our beloved country and for Thy glory . Amen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
