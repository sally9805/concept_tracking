DearTIME-Reader : <P> <P> AMONG the most absorbing stories of our time is the one which tells how the U.S. people are changing the face of their country-for work , for play , for better living . The story weaves its way through each week 's news in TIME : editors and correspondents are always on the alert for its many manifestations . But there is one man who bears a special responsibility for the story : Contributing Editor Alvin M. Josephy Jr. , whose job it is to tell it through color photographs . <P> Some of the stories Editor Josephy 's explorations have turned up : <P> The Inland Empire of the Northwest ( Nov. 1 , 1954 ) , a look at the rich land behind the Rockies and the Cascades , its people , cities , towns , dams and irrigation projects . <P> Tree Farming ( Jan. 17 ) , a graphic report on timber conservation that won cheers from forest rangers and lumber tycoons alike . <P> The Boom That Travelers Built ( March 14 ) , a gallery of palatial new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the growth of the mechanized farm . <P> Recently , our photographers followed Josephy 's script and his well-blazed trail through the Southwest and brought back the transparencies for Art Director Michael J. Phillips to lay out for this week 's color spread on the American Desert . <P> Before he came to TIME in 1951 . Harvard-educated ( ' 36 ) Al Josephy was a New York Herald Tribune correspondent in Mexico . As a combat reporter with the 3rd Marine Division , he wrote two books about the corps , The Long and the Short and the Tall , and Uncommon Valor . Out of the service in 1945 , he went to Hollywood and wrote movie scripts . Later , he edited three weekly newspapers in California . <P> Now his beat is often far from journalism 's trodden paths . He has traveled some 225,000 miles by plane , train , car , marsh-buggy , horseback and afoot about the U.S. His stories have taken him farther into the backwoods and wilderness than even regional reporters get . His contacts along the way include everyone who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Commerce officials , Bureau of Reclamation or Forestry Service agents , rangers , grangers and state legislators - the men who know their areas best . From them he has acquired a knowledge of grassroots U.S. such as few reporters have . <P> Says Josephy : " In the past four years , the U.S. has gone through the fastest transition possibly in its history - certainly in our lifetime . The growing population is spreading out . The empty spaces are filling up . " <P> <P> Cordially yours ,
