Are We Making a Playground Out of College ? Our campuses are becoming marriage mills and fun factories , more devoted to beauty queens than to higher education , charges this professor . Here he urges the abolition of fraternities , student cars and many other " abuses . " By Jerome Ellison During a sunny day one autumn a colleague of mine was counseling a freshman girl at the University of Georgia . He explained that a certain course could not be taken without prerequisites amounting to about two years ' work . " But I wo n't be here that long , " the lass protested . " At the end of this school year I 'm getting married . " Just to be nice my friend asked who the lucky man was . " Oh , I 've just got here , " said the miss , " and have n't met him yet . " Out of curiosity , the professor kept tabs . The wedding took place in a burst of orange blossoms just after the close of the next semester , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the large , tax-supported coeducational plants that turn out more than half of all our college graduates , that most people assume it 's probably all right . After four years on the inside , as a member of a university faculty , 1 , for one , am not at all sure it 's all right . It 's part of a growing . national inclination to push education aside whenever it interferes with love or comfort , money or fun . In today 's world I question whether we can afford it . Communists and free men agree on at least one thing ? the abler , better-informed side in this contest is more likely to prevail . Higher education will play an increasingly vital role in the struggle . We water it down , it seems to me , at our own great peril . And watering it down we certainly are . The boys , I have noticed , go along in the business as readily as the girls . In one of my own courses at Indiana University there enrolled , not long ago , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fairly intelligent , had a car , and was going steady with a girl in his home town , a hundred miles away . " Man , this is wearing  --  driving back and forth to Kokomo twice a week ! " he said onetime when on the carpet about a late assignment . Later , on a like occasion , " Man , this is killing  --  all these science courses ! " He shortly solved all his problems by marrying the girl , moving into a university-subsidized apartment on campus , and switching from dentistry to recreation  --  a curriculum which allows one to become a bachelor of science without ever having to study mathematics , language , chemistry , physics , history or science , but only things like volley ball , archery , lacrosse , deep breathing and refereeing . My quarrel here is not with the change in career , but with the reasons . Our crowded , roaring slums testify to our need for trained recreation people . But this young oaf switched , not because he had discovered a national need , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling that when the sun beats hot on the city pavements and the slumkids really need him , he 'll be at home in front of the air conditioner . Frequently , when counseling a bright student , I point out that we live in an age of science , that one of the bases of science is mathematics , and that the educated man of our day should have a little math . The point that math matters is never questioned . " But , " I am almost always told , " it 's hard ! " The student paws through the catalogue again , seeking a course which is easier but probably irrelevant to his total plan . Similarly , we often cite the need  --  in a nation that has a mere 6 per cent of earth 's people , and must for its survival learn to get on with the other 9-1. per cent  --  for language training . Here again , the cry goes up , " Too hard ! " Some students go to extremes to avoid a language . I worked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalist , and who has now , at last , become one . But the course in journalism required eighteen hours of a foreign tongue . He enrolled in a teacher-training course , which did not require a language for a degree , and took his journalism in electives ? " on the side " ! The prevalence of this sort of thing , and the extent to which school authorities play along with it , is something , I here assert , really to be exercised about . I have seen too much of the power of higher education to widen and ennoble human life to stand by without protest while this vital power is vitiated . It was through a land-grant university that my father worked his way from the rudest of back-country farms into the vastly expanded horizons of a respected profession . A similar school helped me to spend my own life in the kind of work 1 love . And if 1 have learned anything from that work  --  twenty-five years of editing , writing , teaching and publishing  --  it is that the fate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizenry . Half-educated wo n't do . Man 's survival hangs now upon his wisdom . In the light of this conclusion , some things about our mass higher education seem basically immoral . I am not here referring to the sexual aspect of morality . An informal consensus of deans seems to be that the standard in this particular is possibly a shade higher than that of the parents of today 's students . Of course , young people in and out of college , today as always , get into scrapes through mismanagement of their sex lives . But for sheer bawdy brazenness I have seen nothing to vie with the letter to the Wisconsin student paper which opened : " We who are not virgins smile at the notion that we have lost our self-respect , " and went on to expound the " fuller " life . This was written in the 1930 's by a girl who may now be a staid grandmother . The thing that concerns me is an intellectual immorality  --  the encroachment upon the main business of college of an accumulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that often takes precedence over the first . The Second Curriculum is that odd mixture of status hunger , voodoo , tradition , lust , stereotyped dissipation , love , solid achievement , and plain good fun sometimes called " college life . " It drives a high proportion of our students through college chronically short of sleep , behind in their work , and uncertain of the exact score in any department of life . To gain some notion of the extent to which the Second Curriculum has taken over , we 'll whisk through , in a moment , an ordinary year 's calendar at a Big Ten school . First let us set the scene . You start with a broad expanse of tree-studded lawn , perhaps half a mile square , dotted with buildings rendered in several versions of collegiate architecture . One of these structures is the student union , a rallying point for snacking , dalliance and amusement . From morning until night it resounds to the blare of the jukebox , the clink of coffee cups , the clatter of bowling pins , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the gentle creak of lounge chairs and , in the plushicr ones , the splash of languid bodies in tepid swimming pools . There 's likely to be an informal dance here every Friday and Saturday night , They have a ball  --  banquet or name-band dance  --  about every weekend in the ballroom . Fringing the main campus and sprawling for a mile in every direction are student living quarters  --  fraternities and rooming houses both stately and squat , trailer camps , huge residence units resembling , according to the architectural mood , medieval castles or modern luxury hotels . The whole panorama  --  so well has Joe College sold his old man on the principle that a car is needed for study  --  is overrun with automobiles . Our big campuses are churning in a traffic turmoil that almost has to be seen to be believed . Some schools  --  Indiana is one  --  issue stickers , dubbed " hunting licenses , " which permit the student to park on campus if he can find a space . Others , following a method used at Wisconsin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fee , which covers shuttle-bus service to school . in some of the better-motorized universities , more than half the students have cars . Duke , Fairleigh Dickinson , Johns Hopkins , Houston , Louisiana , Maryland , Nebraska , Oregon State , Syracuse , Texas and Iowa all average  --  according to a study made at the University of Houston  --  over half a car , and up to one car , per student . Ohio State 's 19,000 students operate 11,640 motor vehicles . The student-to-car ratio at Wisconsin , 15,000-5800 ; at Purdue , 13,000-5100 ; at Northwestern , 15.000-2500 ; at Illinois , 23,000-5000 ; at Indiana , 11,000-4500 ; at Michigan State 19,000-6400 . These cars support enterprises  --  drive-in restaurants , drive-in theaters ( known in college jargon as " passion pits " ) , miniature golf courses , roller-skating rinks , gin mills  --  many miles from the campus . More than a fifth of the students arc married . This statistic has profoundly affected university life at all levels . For one thing , the housing people have been caught short . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred units short in married-student housing last fall , while newly completed quarters for single students stood vacant . The big coed plants are building married housing pell-mell , trying to catch up with a growing trend . In eleven state universities with a total enrollment of 160,000 , more than 21 per cent of last autumn 's students were married . The expected figure for four years hence is one in four , The large married minority strongly influences the single majority . Most of the girls are striving , sometimes with unladylike eagerness , to get married  --  the Georgia coed mentioned earlier has her counterparts in every state . The steps to success are going steady , " pinning " ? exchange of fraternity badges or other club symbols  --  formal engagement and marriage . Monthly box scores of pinnings , published by some college papers , are read with sports-page avidity . Since even the bottom rung of the coed success ladder can not be mounted unless one is dated , the pressure to date is enormous . The emotional backlash of failure to date is profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing in the student daily , reports that half the sorority pillows are " wet with tears " of a Saturday night  --  no dates . I know of one attempted suicide over the business . The male reacts to the same pressures in a variety of ways . He may affect a cynical Don Juanism or a guarded wariness . Or his own pillow may be wet with tears , or he may simply yield to community pressure and start populating the nursery school the university maintains for married students ' children . In any event , both male and female live in daily tension , after an all-campus sweepstakes , including preliminaries , semifinals and finals , somebody is crowned sweater queen . In October and November various queens and sweethearts  --  a sweetheart of , say , Beta Theta Pi , Sigma Chi or Dodds House , is about the same as a queen  --  are elevated . With sandwich men , posters , torchlight and sports-car parades , students elect a homecoming queen , a military-ball queen , a queen of the autumn formal , a yearbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junior-prom queen , and some others . This year sonic publications students , seeking a device to promote the sale of the college annual , came up with the idea of electing a queen queen . Nobody was eligible who had not previously been a queen of something . Forty-three young women qualified . Our queen program , my research has revealed , lags somewhat behind Big Ten standards . Ohio State has everything we have , plus a pumpkin-prom queen , a rose queen , a Greek Week queen , a May queen and a boat-race queen . Illinois has a men's-residence-hall queen , a sno-ball queen , a dolphin queen , a Miss Photoflash , a star-and-scroll queen , a Sheequon queen and a plowboy-prom queen . As with the goose , so with the gander  --  bachelors and kings are selected from among the male students . The Indiana campus elects a bachelor of the year , Illinois elevates a most-eligible bachelor , Ohio State elects a Greek Week king , Wisconsin honors a campus clown , a dorm duke , a KD king and a Kat 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest against the whole silly business in the form of a " most-useless-man " contest . Typical campaign ad : " He 's so useless the state has paid his tuition for ten years to keep him out of industry . " One time a few years ago some pranksters , fed up with queens , ran a nanny goat for prom queen . Horrified campus politicians protested that she was not female and therefore not eligible . When her backers produced a veterinarian to attest her femininity , her foes finally got her disqualified on the ground that she had not been in residence on campus the preceding year . Nevertheless , she ran a strong third in the voting . These diversions are , of course , over and above those amusements which are considered by school authorities to have cultural , educational or recreational value . Every university schedules a dazzling string of road shows for its auditorium . A typical year will bring two Broadway musical comedies , two celebrated violinists , two world-famous symphony orchestras . a renowned opera company , two fits ) - rate ballet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pianists , sopranos , bands and lecturers . Besides this , university academic departments , particularly those of music , theater and dance , offer several entertainments and lectures weekly for the diversion of the student . But come , does not all work and no play make Jack a dull boy ? Lest ennui overtake Jack , the typical student union offers a bridge club , an arts-and-crafts club , a chess club , a photo club , a sailing club and a golf club , besides bowling , billiards and record concerts . We shall have sound minds in sound bodies  --  as long as both can stand the strain . The year-round program of intramural sports is open to all students  --  touch football , softball , badminton , golf , table tennis . In schools which offer what is considered an adequate Second Curriculum , each college generation is expected to produce its quota of pranks , " outbreaks " and illegal highjinks . Last year , five Ohio State freshmen got drunk in Kentucky , stole a corpse from an undertaking parlor , transported it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building on the Columbus campus . The same year , Columbus police had to use tear gas to break up a riot , over nothing in particular , of 3000 students who invaded the city 's business district . The riot started with a few students pelting each other with oranges . and wound up with twenty-eight of them in jail on charges of disorderly conduct , assault and battery , throwing firecrackers , resisting arrest , blocking traffic , and unsafe operation of motor vehicles . Illinois ' contribution to this lore is the celebrated water fight of April , 1958 , in which 6000 berserk students opened fire hydrants , routed the local fire department and drenched the dean of students . I am impressed by the fact that the year in which college students in Hungary started an immortal revolution to free their country from tyranny , the big thing on the Indiana campus was a panty raid . On the day in which a local school was bombed and the countdown began for one of our major satellite attempts , a Big Ten student paper carried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes ; love , certainly ; marriage in good time , of course . But shall these things be gained out of season , at too dear a price ? Some of us are beginning to ask what very little work and an awful lot of play makes Jack . What should be done ? Half a dozen useful suggestions are in circulation and receiving minority support among the faculties of our colleges and universities . All that is needed to place them on the action agenda is a little public outcry . The first step would be to prohibit automobiles . There would be a pitiable bleating , but all , I am sure , would pronounce the action a benefit , Princeton men do not appear unhappier than most , and their scholarship ranks with the world 's best . Yet they are not allowed to operate motor vehicles while attending college . The next step would be to disband fraternities and sororities . Here , I must confess . my heart skips a beat as I turn in my old badge . I have even shed a quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep and dear . But the plain fact is that the system has outlived its usefulness , This fact must be faced , even by sentimental fraternity men like myself . Glenn H. Goodman , of the Ohio State faculty , has let fly at fraternities for " picking top men and isolating them in an atmosphere of football , adolescent discussions , dating and drinking . " 710. ' 1'itC SATURDAY EVE.NINO POST I could add other serious charges . Besides providing the prime breeding grounds of I he " minimum effort " attitude . fraternities too often breed a tawdry Don Juanism , a callow and provincial snobbishness , the habit of getting drunk and a world view no broader than a dollar bill . Worst of all . they consume quantities of time , effort , money and emotional stress  --  with their chronic financial troubles , panicked rushing season , and **26;1512;TOOLONG monkeyshines  --  out of all proportion to the good they offer in terms of fellowship . My apologies are tendered to chapters which do not deserve such harsh words . But enough of them do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they doom the whole system . The same apology goes to those students  --  and I have known quite a number  --  with the integrity and plain nerve to resist the pressures of the conforming mob , place the Second Curriculum firmly in second place and do a job in college . The fact that a few unusual individuals can win through to an education does not , however , weaken my case  --  which is that universities have no right to make it almost impossible for students to study . Several other things might be done to cut down ill-formed attitudes toward scholarship . toward marriage and toward the relationship between them . Plush university housing should not be offered until the head of the house is at least a senior . usually achieved at the age of twenty-one . This would remove cheap , pleasant , subsidized living  --  an abnormal condition which the young couple can not expect to find later on  --  as a temptation to impulsive teen-age marriage . At the same time it would not obstruct love so deep and true , though young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standards of scholarship are responsive to public expectation . Our state universities face a rising  --  and , in my thinking , justified  --  public opinion that education beyond high school is every child 's right . Let us , then . offer a two-year university curriculum , crowned with an associatein-arts degree for those who pass it successfully . Our many junior colleges have set the precedent . Let it be tough , and let it be the same for everybody . Those who wish to go on for the full four years would return to college in a frame of mind to get down to business . A reentrance examination at the beginning of the junior year should be tough enough to weed out those who are in college mainly for the Second Curriculum . These are some of the suggestions currently in the air , and there are others  --  the problem is nationwide . Citing popular pressure for easy , fun-packed college degrees , Richard B. Hovey of Western Maryland College , addressing the College English Association , has come down smartly on the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of college graduates ca n't even write grammatically or spell correctly . and has asked the reasons . He finds that standards are shot , and that there 's not much a teacher can do about it . " An individual teacher can not suddenly decide to have standards ; let him fail half or more of a class , and he will soon be in trouble with his administrators . " He finds , moreover , that students understand this and take advantage of it " Our student knows that unless he is . . . unforgivably negligent , he will get by . " The burden of the Second Curriculum is wryly acknowledged everywhere . To him who may question its baleful effect , I extend the invitation to take my place some morning . Let him face an early class he 's knocked his brains out to prepare for . Let him address the blank stares and vacant faces of a roomful of students who knocked their brains out the night before at the Sophomore Twitch , the Winter Will ies , the Monumental Maul , the Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now that we 're over on the teaching side , what about the teachers ? The faculty , as certain current novels suggest . is far from perfect . Entering the academic life from the " outside world , " one is disappointed by the banality of conversation at social gatherings , and by attitudes of old-fashioned trade-unionism centering on " tenure , " a word which means that after they 've kept you on forseven years it 's almost impossible for them to fire you . This concern for tenure bends many teachers toward cautious utterance , often blunting the kind of searching , outspoken discourse that might explode into exciting teaching and learning . Here , though , I 'd like to say a word in defense of the kind of repetitious teaching called " time serving . " There are certain foundation subjects , often humdrum , that the student simply has to " get . " These are the barren places in the terrain of learning which must be crossed to reach the thrilling peaks beyond . The work is a rut , and here the patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faculty " stars , " and every faculty has some bright ones . When my own resolve flags . I can look to men like H. J. Muller , our Nobel Prize winner in genetics ; Bob Byrnes in history ; Bill Wilson in English ; Schuyler Otteson in economics and Bill Moore in physiology , and I become refreshed . These men have broken the confines of their own specialties to look at the universe and have found courage to state their views regardless of what special interest may be offended . In intellectual daring of this order we may hope to find , through education . the glory of the future And what a future beckons ! The purely mechanical side already has been pretty well publicized the two-day work week , the trips through space , world tours as a standard part of grade-school education , the time when the deserts will bloom and the jungles will be made into gardens . The new day of the human soul has , however , scarcely been mentioned . Some think the long-sought substitute for war is close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enemy into a co-operative and willing friend . In the resulting leisure and plenty , man might begin to develop his potential in art and philosophy . The artist and poet in each of us would find expression . We would stand before the goal of goals for all men  --  the penetration into the deepest meaning of life itself , These wonders will not drop into our laps without our effort , Indeed , to avoid a quick catastrophe , we 'll have to work as never before . And the kind of work most urgently demanded is work of the mind . We 'll have to think our way out of this one . We need tough , seasoned , disciplined thinkers , incorruptible , enormously well informed , skilled in their chosen specialties , but with an appreciation of all specialties  --  thinkers who can not be diverted to limited or shoddy goals  --  and we need a lot of them . For these reasons , the Second Curriculum must be trimmed . This must be done , not in spite or through outraged morality , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are concerned about Jack and Jacqueline would like to see more . not less , love on the campus . Besides the inevitable and proper love of comfort and fun , of boy for girl , of status and position , of exercise and sport , of family and children , we 'd like to see some love of truth and intellectual achievement . of discovery and high adventure , of beauty , harmony , design and great precision , of mankind and its farthest destiny . We would like , in short , to see the First Curriculum come first .
