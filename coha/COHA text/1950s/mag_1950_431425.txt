 | The hearth owner daily celebrates the greatest of all discoveries ? that of fire . No one knows what early human we have to thank for capturing the leaping demon and caging him to keep us warm . The Greeks thanked a mythological Prometheus , who stole fire from heaven ; for this the gods punished him , but not even they could take from mankind the mighty secret . For fire is mans secret uniquely ; no other animal can make or use it , though we can see the hearthside cat or dog worship it with shining eyes . For ourselves , the hearth has become the family altar . Above it the householder enshrines what he likes best to look at ? be it an old gun or a ship model , his ancestor 's portrait , or his child 's . The chimney of my boyhood home bore these words in stencil , from the great canticle of praise in the prayer book : " 0 Ye Fire and Heat , Praise Ye the Lord . " That hearth and its immediate vicinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred to family joys , sacred from children 's disputes , grownups ' money cares , the recital of the day 's irritations . On that spot , I knew , my mother and father had been married . I saw my sister married there . And here , while I watched the flames lick the redoak logs and saw the fiery castles turn to ashen wraiths , I listened to stories and met the most fascinating people in the world ? Huckleberry Finn and Long John Silver , King Arthur and King Lear . For untold time , millions have known like joys and associations with the hearth ; indeed , the first hearthstones mark the beginning of civilization . For , unlike the wandering beasts , man knew now a spot so dear that he would die defending it , and seeing the smoke of other hearths arise , he first learned the meaning of neighbor . By Roman times there came to be three little hearthside gods , represented by statuettes on the mantelpiece . One was the Lar , the spirit of ancestors presiding in benediction ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Plenty , respectively . And when a young Roman took his wife to their new home , he carried from his father 's fireplace a torch to light the new one , in token of the continuity of family life . The sweet religion of the hearth still has its meanings for us today . When my wife and I wished to build a little studio on land pioneered by her forebears , there were no Lares and Penates she could bring from the house where she was born , for that had been destroyed by fire . Nothing was left of all its treasures save the bricks of the chimney , lying in the grass where time had weathered them to subtle patterns . Of these our chimney piece was raised . BUT there ca n't be hearthside comfort unless fireplace , flue , and chimney are properly constructed . A single slip will make all the difference between a sparkling success and a murky failure . The science of fireplace and chimney construction is as exact as bridge building , and not every mason who can lay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you nicely on the appropriate style for your room , knows how to make a chimney draw . The chimney top must clear the highest roof of the house by 2 or 3 feet , and it must also clear the trees if they are close . The width of the flue should be not less than 70 square inches , while the length of the throat should be about the same as the width of the fireplace opening . A smoke shelf and smoke chamber just above the throat are essential to act as a catch basin when a puff of wind dampers the chimney . The depth of the shelf should vary in proportion with the depth of the fireplace , but should never be less than 4 inches . If no damper is used , the throat opening should be 4 inches for fireplaces not exceeding 4 feet in height . If you have a damper , open it full width for burning smoky coniferous woods ? pine , hemlock , spruce , balsam , cedar , and tamarack . For the hardwoods ? oak , hickory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 2 inches to save heat . To get further guidance , if you are planning a hearth , send to the Superintendent of Documents , in Washington , D , C. , for Farmer 's Bulletin No. 1889 , Fireplaces and Chimneys . Many a home builder finds worth while the initial outlay for a ready-made or built-in firebox , scientifically constructed  | the deodorant that works Wonderful Yodora does not merely mask , but stops perspiration odor . Effective for full 24-hour protection . not only to conserve and throw out the greatest heat but to take in cold air , heat it in a hidden chamber , and distribute it through the room or even into an adjoining chamber . There are a number of such fireboxes on the market , and when one is installed , it can , of course , be faced with any sort of stone or brick or paneling . If hearth making is a science , the laying of a fire is an art . I have my own simple theories ; among them is the desirability of building a small fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting with pine or eucalyptus for a quick result and adding oak or hickory . Two logs will not keep each other alight after the kindling has been consumed ? at least they wo n't for me ; four logs are too many , smothering a young fire and making an old fire too hot . But three are , like Baby Bear 's porridge , " just right , " two side by side and one lying obliquely across them . However , I am quite used to having my friends , from Boy Scouts to grandmothers , take the wood out of my hands , with a " Here , that will never burn . Let me show you ! " Some put the logs on the bottom , the kindling on top ; some stand the logs up on end and lean them against the back of the fireplace . In all cases , the fire burns well . Why should n't it ? The wood is dry , the kindling is as tinder , the chimney draws well . So my guests are happy , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superior to me , which is an ingredient in friendship . Thus , above my rooftree floats the blue-and-violet flag of peace . Everyone knows you can tell the weather by the behavior of that chimney smoke . If it blows down from the chimney and slinks along the ground , rain is coming ; if it stands straight up , dry , crisp weather is promised . Moreover , if the smoke is piling out of the chimney in sweet-smelling , dense billows , then the master of the house is in ; he has just started the fire . If the smoke is spinning out in a long , lazy , bitter-smelling twirl , then he may have gone out , for the fire is dying . A hearthfire at its height shows only a transparent violet wraith of smoke dancing on vigorous heat waves ; at such a time , probably the whole family is gathered around . A friend 's hearth smoke is like a crooked finger , beckoning you in . The perfume reaches out and greets you before your friend comes to the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the country where I have lived , I could identify it by the odors of the woods men burn on their hearths there . Certainly I would know Santa Fe , if not by the silver clangor of its old bells and the clapping of donkey hoofs , then by that odor , sweeter than cathedral incense , of the pifion smoke ? a sort of juniper . I would know I was in the South by the rich , sweet reek of " lightwood " or fat pine . But if I smelled the clean , commingled odors of eucalyptus and live oak , I would be sure I was in California , near my home woodpile . Thoreau , called " the man who could see beauty in ashes , " was the quaint philosopher who said that his firewood warmed him twice ? once when he cut it and again when he burned it . Few of us today claim the pains and privilege of chopping our own wood , but most of us want to know , at least , that we are getting full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Always buy wood by the cord , a standard measure , never by the truckload , for wood tossed lightly into the truck looks like a lot more than it is . If you wish to know whether you got a full cord , stack it solidly in a pile eight feet long , four feet wide , and four feet high . That , including the air spaces , is a cord . Green wood is worth four or five dollars less a cord than seasoned wood of the same species , and branch wood is worth much less than log wood . I buy green wood in the spring , season it at no cost to myself over the summer , and begin burning the dry wood in fall . Never buy mixed lots of wood : basswood ane hickory in the same truckload have completely different fuel values ; consequently , hickory is worth twice as much in dollars as basswood . THE American people , in all parts of the country , have the finest fuel woods in the world . No other country in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , the hardwoods throw out the most heat and last longest . Even so , there is a great difference in their value , and the Forest Service has been asked about this so many times that the Department of Agriculture has issued a Farmer 's Bulletin No. 1912 , on the use of wood for fuel . Here is a digest of a few of the commonest kinds of fuel wood , with the heat value of a cord of seasoned wood approximated in terms of percentage of a short ton of high-grade anthracite coal : 48% basswood ( linden ) 49 yellow buckeye 52 black willow , eastern balsam jack pine 53 lodgepole pine 54 trembling aspen , white spruce 55 butternut , sugar pine , white pine , redwood 58 eastern cottonwood , yellow poplar ( tulip tree ) , eastern hemlock western yellow pine , red spruce 63 western canoe cedar , southern swamp cypress 68 white elm , red gum , Pacific Douglas Fir , Norway ( red ) p 70 paper birch 71 wild black cherry , black gu , sycamore , pitch pine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western larch 75 sassafras 77 sourwood , loblolly pine , shortleaf pine 80 beech , yellow birch , California laurel , black walnut 81 southern longleaf pine 83 laurel oak , red oak 84 sugar maple 85 yellow oak 86 chestnut oak 87 burr oak 88 white ash 90 sweet birch 92 white oak , post oak 93 blue gum ( eucalyptus ) , pecan Spanish oak 94 water hickory , holly , sweetpod locust , California madrons 95 hawthorn , shellbark hickory , hornbeam 96 persimmon 97 dogwood swamp Spanish 98 mockernut hickory , shagbark hickory 100 pignut hickory , serviceberry 102 black locust 106 canyon live oak 118 osage orange This table does not tell the whole story . Some woods , such as pine , spruce , and eucalyptus , are impregnated with resins , li oils , and gums that burn with a hotter flame than the wood itself , so you get most out of them if you use them halfgreen . And some of these woods sound better than they are . Most swamp trees , such as black gum , can hold moisture longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among these has to be reckoned the beloved elm , which , in nature , is a riverbank tree . So on the hearth it " sobs along , " as our pioneer ancestors used to say of it , weeping watery tears and sighing steam through its cracks , but using up more heat than it ever gives out . Hemlock , spruce , tamarack , and balsam make a fine , hot blaze , but look out for a perfect fireworks display of sparks ! The sapwoods of red gum and white oak burn quietly enough ; but when the heat strikes the heartwood , they explode in red-hot , low-flying chunks . Dogwood and Christmas holly stand high on the list of fuel values ? but let us hope nobody chops down such beautiful little trees . Paper birch looks so fair in a fine old New England fireplace that it seems a shame to burn it , yet there are plentv of insect-killed or down birches that will have to be removed anyway . It burns with a brilliant yellow flame and gives out a fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , I recommend sycamore , when dry ; it burns tranquilly and reduces itself to complete ash . But , to my taste , the prince of Eastern fuel woods is hickory . There is no other country in the world , except Canada , where it grows , so it is as American as Andrew Jackson or corn on the cob . Our pioneer ancestors learned from the Indians to use it in preference to any other fuel , so hot is its fire , so long-lasting its bed of coals . For three hundred years our finest hams have been cured in hickory smoke . Hickory ramrods did not send home the powder charges that won the American Revolution more truly than the pioneers sent winter flying from their cabin doors with six-foot hickory logs on their hearths . When you burn hickory today , you send up incense smoke to the Lares of American folkways . WE consume about 45,000,000 cords of firewood a year , only a small proportion of it going to industrial use . But most of the trees cut for firewood today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are useful for little else , or they are dead or down trees , or represent land-clearings or pruning . Precious cabinet woods and rare species are no longer flung on the fire . Judicious thinning of a forest for firewood serves only to increase the stand of saw-log timber by removing old , diseased , or weak trees . So , untroubled , draw up your chair to the fireplace and enjoy your share of this country 's noble woods . Never does your room look so welcoming to guests as when the firelight flickers on the backs of books , shines on silverware , and twinkles in mirrors . Do you want to listen to music ? Turn off all the lights , and let the blazing logs cast their magic spell . Pepe smoke tastes best then ; books are wisest , children are dearest , with firelight dancing in their eyes . Wives are coziest then , husbands less hard to take , I hope . There is one figure that no statistician can calculate when he assays the heating power of firewood ? how much it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
