 | RUTH DRAPER MY WONDERFUL life goes miraculously on . " So she wrote at over seventy , to a friend of thirty years standing ; and the life she meant was surely not her own , but that of the full company of actors whom , wherever she went , she conjured up beside her . When did she first begin to summon them ? Perhaps she herself could not have said . A cousin , in whose house she often stayed in childhood , recollects that , when she was only eight or ten years old , the other children would gather round her in the nursery at bedtime . " Do the Channel crossing , Ruth ! " " Do Mrs. X ! " " Do Fraulein ! " Acid suddenly , sitting on the edge of her bed , the small girl in a nightgown would call up , for the benefit of her beguiled , bemused , and soon wildly giggling contemporaries , a whole procession of mercilessly delineated , exquisitely absurd grownups . A little later , it was the guests in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an equally appreciative audience in the sewing room or pantry . It was from one of these that , fifty years later , when Ruth was playing at the Gaiety Theatre in Dublin , a letter came : " I 'm not surprised at the Posetion you took up , as many a time Bridget Brodrick was trying to control yourself and Master Paul in the Laundry-room with your antics . " Master Paul was Ruth 's brother , the youngest and closest to her in age of the family of eight ? it RUTH DRAPER  | Ruth 's half-brother and sister , William Kinnicutt and Martha , and then Charles , George , Dorothea , Alice , Ruth , and Paul ? who lived in Dr. William H. Draper 's house on 47th Street , New York . Ruth 's grandfather was Charles A. Dana , the publisher and editor of the old New York Sun ; her father , a brilliant and much-loved doctor ; and the guests who came to the house came from the world of letters and music , as well as from that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were visits to museums , to concerts , to the theater , and then the first parties as a debutante ; there were summers at Dark Harbor in Maine , the place which remained , perhaps , the nearest to Ruth 's heart , and where later on she opened the doors of her house and her heart to her friends , among them those from Italy who had become voluntary exiles during the Fascist years . As bright-eyed and inclustrious and ruthless as a young squirrel , the girl stored up the inflections and gestures which became her stock in trade . The German Governess , The Children 's Party , The Boston Art Galley , The Debutante ? all date from these early , ineradicable memories . At first , however , it was only at home that Ruth 's talents were displayed . " Do something to amuse us , my dear , " her mother would say when the conversation flagged after dinner , and at the end of the evening , weak with laughter , the guests would cry , " That child ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the great Paderewski , said it seriously ? and it was to him that Ruth listened . When the Junior League needed talent for a charity performance , it was she who proved so great a draw that soon other charities , too , asked for her help . Again Ruth agreed , gradually adding to her repertoire and attracting a larger audience , but still stipulating that the proceeds were to be sent directly to the charity concerned . It was not until January 29 , 1920 , that she made her professional debut at the Aeolian Hall in London and filled it to capacity . At last she had become what she had always wished to be ? a professional . From then until thirty-seven years later ? until , . udeed , only a few hours before her death at the age of seventy-two ? the story is one of unbroken triumph . Yet the secret of her vast , her universal success still remains elusive . How was it possible for this slight , bright-eyed little woman to fill her theaters night after night for forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York as in Bangkok , to be applauded by young and old alike , to be appreciated at Windsor Castle and in a Mexican mining town ? How was so complete an illusion created with such slender means ? To a degree , this is always true of the actor 's art . " Every night , " wrote Virginia Woolf , " when the curtain goes down , the beautiful coloured canvas is rubbed out . What remains is at best only a wavering , insubstantial phantom , a verbal life on the lips of the living . " If this is true in general , it is peculiarly so of Ruth 's vivid impersonations . Since the parts she played were only those she had created for herself , she never became identified with any of the symbolic , eternal figures of the stage : she was never Electra , Athalie , or Ophelia . Actresses who play these parts ? however variously they may interpret them ? take on for a season something of the greatness of the minds which first conceived them : the air they breathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when their voice is stilled , their memory is indissolubly bound to the image they brought to life : we say Sarah 's Phedre and Ellen Terry 's Desdemona . This world Ruth never entered at all . Her talent was on a smaller scale , but it was a gift entirely authentic , absolutely her own ? requiring no props , no costumes , no fellow actors , not even- a playwright . Scenery ? At the end of the script of her monologues there is a list of her stage requirements , as meager , surely , as can be found in the history of the stage . For Doctors and Diets , " a small rectangular table and a restaurant chair " ; for At the Court of Philip IV , " two long , low benches " ; for An Italian Church , " a small rush-bottom chair " ; for most of the others , nothing at all . Costumes ? A few hats , mostly rather battered , a dressing gown , a raincoat , and a collection of shawls . These last were her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they turned her into an old Irishwoman , a young Italian girl in church , a Dalmatian peasant , a great Spanish lady . By Ruth 's own desire , they draped her coffin on the day of her funeral . As she dispensed with props , so she laboriously worked out for herself her own technique , alone , disregarding the advice of even the greatest professionals . " Pourquoi ne faites-vous pas la comedie ? " asked Sarah Bernhardt , after hearing her . " Mon enfant , ne faites jamais la comedie , " said Duse . Ruth thanked them prettily ? and went her own way . For one season only , thinking that she might learn something from working in the company of a great actress , she accepted a minor part in one of Marie Tempest 's plays . But it was a failure : Ruth became a mere shadow of herself , her whole personality muted . The experiment was never repeated . " My dear , " said Henry James , " you have made for yourself a little carpet of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did she find her subject matter ? In everyone she knew . Her sketches are a series of  | delicate , brilliant , utterly convincing conversation pieces , in which the only speaker , with many voices , is Ruth herself . For this is what she really cared for : people , daily life . She went round an English garden with her hostess ; she sat in an Italian church ; she attended a courtroom ; she spoke to a child in the street . Then she went home and worked . She worked very hard indeed . " I am happy , " Ellen Terry once wrote to GBS , " not to be clever , " and the reason she gave him was that " you clever people miss so much . " Ruth , too , seized the things that the " clever people " so often miss , the thousand tiny details of which daily life is made , which chill or warm the heart . Alone in her room , she imagined the people she wished to portray ; she thought about their life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had lived herself into her subject , she worked before the mirror , experimenting with facial expressions and gestures . Sometimes the preparation of a sketch , before she was satisfied with it , took eight or ten years . It was all done , she once said to my children , by imagination . " Think hard enough about drinking the juice of seven lemons , and you 'll have the right face ! " The script of her monologues was written down , but served merely as an accessory to her memory . The point of her sketches was not in their verbal brilliance ? when one came home from the theater , there were few sentences that remained in the memory ? but rather in the extraordinary accuracy and delicacy of ear which enabled her to build up , by a thousand imperceptible touches , her finished portraits . Moreover she treated her script merely as a framework . No two performances were precisely the same . A different inflection , an interpolated sentence , a new gesture ? these , after forty years of repetition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some forty sketches in which she played fifty-eight parts , in English ; French , German , Italian , with an Irish brogue or a Highland lilt , or in the brilliant invented languages of her " imaginary folk songs " and of the flower names of her English garden . " Next week my Funnafelosis will be in bloom . . . and those darling little pale Punnlfunkums . You do n't know the Punnyfunkums ? . . . But my poor Glubjullas never came up at all , " She took us to an English bazaar , a Southern dance , a porch in a Maine coast village , a New York hospital , a station on the Western Plains , a windswept beach in Normandy ; we shared in a class in Greek poise , a lunch in a smart New York restaurant , and in the efforts of a whole English village to prepare a country cottage for a soldier 's return from the war . Perhaps the most remarkable of her gifts was her power to bring upon the stage , in addition to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Three Women and Mr. Clifford , for instance . Ruth was each of the three women in turn : Mr. Clifford 's wife , his secretary , and the woman he loved . He himself never appeared , except through them . Yet most of us would agree with the member of the audience who , on his way out of the theater , said to his companion : " Was n't Clifford the most long-suffering jackass in that car ? " ? and only a moment later added , " My God , he was n't there ! " Then there is The Italian Lesson . The curtain goes up ; we see a smart middle-aged woman in a dressing gown on a sofa : " Good morning , Signorina , good morning . I ca n't tell you how excited I am that we have come to Dante at last ! " The lady , at the moment , is alone ; but within two minutes the stage is so full that we are craning forward in our seats to prevent the baby from falling into the wastepaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his head , sweetheart ? that 's his tail " ) , to order the dinner ( " It is n't fish ? I always thought it was fish . It looks like fish , tastes like fish " ) , to fill the opera box ( " Oh , anyone , so long as it 's a man ! No , wait , I picked up a charming young Englishman last week , Sir Basil Something ? I put him on a scrap of paper in the blotter " ) , to design a fancy dress ( " You 'll find ten yards of blue chiffon in the sewing room . The figure of Hope ? a lady , blindfolded , listening to someone , sitting on a ball " ) , to do the shopping ( " a very dirty lampshade on the sofa , and on the mantelpiece a pile of yellow taffeta samples " and " from Brentano 's , by special messenger , a new book called Our Inner Life " ) . And of course , in between , to read Dante . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Signorina , that is what happens to people in the middle of life ? They often become confused . . . " All this is done with great bravura , in almost rollicking high spirits . We laugh and laugh . It is only when it is over that we realize that we have seen the picture of a woman 's whole life ? filled to overflowing , and as empty as a hollow nut . Ruth 's characters , unlike those of most mimics. are never mere silhouettes : we see them in the round , bearing with them their background , their past and future . In Three Generations , imagine Ruth coming onto the stage ( which is completely bare except for a kitchen chair ) as the grandmother ? an ugly , squat old woman holding a black shawl tightly round her head ; beneath it , one has a glimpse of sunken checks drawn in over a toothless jaw . She has a low , harsh voice and a strong Jewish accent . She lifts a shaking hand . " Good morning , Judge . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I live at 64 Orchard Street , with my daughter and granddaughter . . . . Twenty-five years . . . . That 's my home . " She has come before the Judge , in a court of domestic relations , to ask him to prevent her granddaughter , who wants to get married and to go out to the West , from putting her , with her daughter , in an old people 's home . " I 'm an old woman . . . too old to work . And my daughter , she 's got heart trouble and ca n't work . . . . We could n't live without Rosie . " Harshly , bitterly , she mumbles her complaints of her granddaughter 's flightiness and the irresponsibility of the girl 's young man . " She go dance every night , she come home late . . . . And the young man ? he drink ? he make a very bad husband . . . . Rosie she - hould stay by me . Why she must go away ? " Still mumbling , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , the daughter rises . As Ruth Draper throws the shawl back upon her shoulders , a transformation takes place : in an instant , the stooping , toothless old crone has turned into a tall , middle-aged woman of dignity and beauty . ( One of Ruth 's admirers once wrote of her " genius for assuming physical height ? one of the tests of the great ones . The elder Salvini had it , and Irving . " ) Standing very erect and very still before the Judge , she peaks in a faint , flat voice , without acrimony but without hope . One of her sons has tuberculosis , the other has run away ; she has heart trouble and a paralyzed arm . " I sent Rosie to business college , -o she should have a profession . She has a wonder:ul job . And now , she only wants to go . . . . No , sir , I do n't like this young man . He do n't work regular , and he drinks . . . . Please , Judge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's so young . . . and she do n't understand what life is . . . . And she owes me something . " She too sits down , and now Rosic springs up , : tinging off the shawl altogether . She ? how is it done ? ? is youth itself . Her eyes sparkle , her speech is breathless , even the nervous movements of her hands , as she clasps and unclasps them , have the awkward eagerness of youth . What is her name ? " Everyone calls me Rosie ! " She is a stenographer , she loves her work , she loves her home ? " we 've got a very nice little home " ? but yes , she does want to get married . " I want my mother nd grandmother should go to a home for old ople ? and they do n't want to go ! " There is dignation in her voice , and also surprise . But e is a good girl , that is plain . She loves her other and her grandmother and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " The use has got four sides to it ? there 's windows I round ? and in the room they 're going to give y mother and my grandmother , the window looks straight into a tree . . . . They got cretonne drapes and cushions in the chairs . They got a piano and a radio and a Victor . " The old ladies , she says , all seem very contented , " knitting and sitting around . " All this is said with offhand kindliness , in a cool , clear young voice . But when she speaks of her young man , her voice changes , it becomes warmer , deeper ; she begins to plead . " Judge , I ca n't give him up . I got to go . " They have been offered a job on a Western farm . " You go for four days and nights , and when you get out there 's absolutely nothing to see , only earth and sky . . . . No , we do n't know nothing about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , she replies to the Judge 's questions , her young man does not drink . " Well he drunk some because he was so discouraged , but he wo n't drink no more when we get married ? he told me . " No , she did not run about and waste her money . " They 've got every penny I earn . " Yes , she will miss her mother . " I 'll miss her something terrible . " But she must get away . " I want to get out of this . I want my own life . " And then comes the final , desperate appeal . " Ca n't you see ? They 're different ! Judge , do n't make me stay ! " That is all . The Judge tells her to come back next Wednesday and to bring her young man , and we know what the answer will be . Rosie will have her husband and her life . " Come on , Grandma , what 's the use of talking now ? . Come on home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that we realize that it is only one woman that we have been watching ; one woman who , on an empty stage , without even a change of dress , has brought before us old age and middle age and youth ? despair and resignation and rebellious hope ? whose very bones seem to have changed before our eyes . The woman who could do this was not merely a great mimic , but a woman who loved life and human beings . IT WAS this , I think , above all else that drew the vast audiences that packed her theaters year after year . " She is not astonishing you , " wrote Brooks Atkinson , the drama critic of the New York Times , " with the brilliance of her talent . She is modestly asking for your interest in various characters , most of whom represented her respect for the human race . " It was this respect which , for all the sharpness of her observation , took the bitterness out of Ruth 's mockery . The laughter she aroused was never that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling chilled and sad : her audiences , at the evening 's end , took with them a taste as sweet and crisp as that of a ripe apple .  | They took with them , too , especially the young and obscure or the elderly and lonely , a certainty that they had found a friend . They thronged into her greenroom and went on writing to her for years letters which touched her more than those of any of her great contemporaries , which she invariably answered and which she kept all her life . The files in which her correspondence is preserved bear witness to these friendships . There are the letters of a little Scottish boy who was waiting for her one day at the stage door and to whom she went on writing even after he had emigrated to New Zealand , ten years later . There are the notes of an elderly man who writes in the style of her own sketches : " Yes , that 's my name . ? Sixtyseven . ? Yes , unemployed for the last year . Income ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . I had to go in the stalls , because I am a bit deaf . ? Inexcusable extravagance ? No , it will be something for me to talk about , if I have to come down to sitting by the workhouse fire . " And then there are the letters of Fred B. , the owner of a secondhand book barrow in Walworth , who writes to tell Ruth that she is " a dear sweet lady and the greatest actress in the world , " and who soon becomes a friend , so that , the accepts an invitation to see his books . " I shall have the pleasure of calling for you around 5:30 on Thursday , and if buses too full we 'll go by tube to Elephant and Castle and get a tube there . We are working class , and home is humble , but clean and homely , and we are going to get a specially nice tea , with cake and a special treat of flan . " Ten years later the friendship still prospers , and Ruth has sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's the first time in her sixty years of life that she ever sat in the stalls , but I was myself not quite a stranger to the posh seats . " For Fred , meanwhile , has come up in the world : he has begun to write about his book collection and has received a check for five guineas from Town and Country ' . " I 'm in luck and so I did not go out with my barrow this cold day . " Fred is sure that he will go on writing now , " and you will see your name creep in , sort of : I remember on one occasion when Ruth Draper was having tea with me . . . ' The proper swank , yet it does get over and astonish people . And they 'll say , Blimey , he knows Ruth Draper . He must be someone . ' " THE origins of the drama , in every Western land , are rooted in one great theme : the journey of Everyman between Good and Evil . Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were ? followed that great tradition ; they too were morality plays , stories of Everyman 's meeting with Vanity and Passion , with Folly and Despair , but always moving in an ordered , stable world , in which a : the last it is goodness that prevails . Perhaps it was this belief which enabled Ruth . in spite of her own encounters with anxiety and grief , to preserve all her life what was her most irresistible gift : her delight . " My wonderful life goes miraculously on . " If her audiences rejoiced in her , she was no less enchanted by them . " Were n't they wonderful tonight ? " she would say as she left the theater , and the same zest endured on this side of the footlights , in the company of her friends . The moment would come after dinner when the chairs would be pushed into a semicircle and " Do you really want me to ? " Ruth would ask as she rose . " Well , just one before bedtime ? which shall it be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , young voices ? those of the children and grandchildren of her first hearers ? would clamor : " Please , please , The German Gorerness. ! " Now and again , though not often , a life closes in a manner entirely fitting : the pattern is rounded . complete . To Ruth , whose life had been as active as a bird 's , the lean still years of old age would have been unbearable ; the generous hands , always extended to give and to gather in , could never have lain folded . When I saw her last , only three months before her death , she told me about her plans for the coining winter ; the season she was going to give in New York , in the Playhouse Theatre . For the first time she said how greatly she dreaded the day when she would have to give up her work , but added , " It has n't quite come yet ! " I was reminded then of a passage in Ellen Terry 's Story of My Life in which she described the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the stage . " Perhaps , " she added , " my chief joy was that I had not to say goodbye to any of the celebrators . I could still speak to my profession as a fellow-comrade on the active list , and to the public as one still in their service . " Ruth Draper , too , never left the service of her adoring public . Her last season at the Playhouse began on Christmas night and , in spite of bitter weather , she never had a more brilliant opening . The next day , the press was as lavish as ever in it praise . " There is only one Ruth Draper . " On December 29 she gave two performances , but did not admit to any fatigue , and when she came out after the evening show , she drove down Broadway to gaze at the bright lights under the stars . Then , with laughter and applause still ringing in her ears , she went home to bed . When the maid came to wake her the next morning , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She , too , had never had to say good-by.
