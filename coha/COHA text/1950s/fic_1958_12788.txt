These rotting ribs that hold the heart of Spain ? PACO Paco , seor . I am the new grometto . QUADRADO Thou art a boy of mixed blood . Where is thy father ? PACO In Spain , my lord , he was a Spanish soldier . My mother died with the last moon in the mines . My brothers would not work , and the dogs ate them . p. 12 QUADRADO Of what nation of the Indians art thou ? PACO Of the Tainos , Excellency . QUADRADO The Tainos . Yes , the peaceful ones .

QUADRADO So you have learnt the value of our faith . ( Removes a coin . ) Do you know what this is , my little disciple ? PACO It is gold , my officer , I have learnt that . QUADRADO In the Old World that men called civilization , Acquire it if you wish to make some mark . The true stamp of acquisitive man is here , Compounded in his image , not his maker 's . Study this coin , it gathers darkness around it , And like the sun , brings its own darkness , guilt .

We did not call it that when in the ground . ( GARCIA enters unobserved , listening . ) QUADRADO We gather this , grometto , with much devotion , As peaceful Indians harvest yellow maize ; It makes our markets and controls the state And sets up barriers that obscure that view Where now the admiral achieves his degradation . PACO And that is why the admiral looked for these islands ? QUADRADO You must ask him yourself . Here , keep the coin , Since my own people taught you of its value , See how it dims in the bewildering dusk , But though you take it , please remember this , That gold outlasts the wearer . Here , keep our God . PACO I thank you , my officer , I shall keep it always . QUADRADO Also , Paco , until this mutinous vessel reaches Spain , Think of me not as your officer but as your father . Now , go fetch the admiral his supper , go . ( Exit PACO ; enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be a rough night . It will be different for them as can not sleep .

BARTOLOME ( Singing in hold . ) There is a fount in Paradise , A much distasteful place , So high indeed that fountain jets , It touches the far lunar sphere . I ca n't see a damn in this wet hellhole , move , move . Here comes the prince of purgatory with his lanterns . GARCIA Be careful with that fire , and plug your bung .

Lower the tongue of the lantern , good Bartolome. p. 16 BARTOLOME And God give us all good rest , and spare us envy , And too much rattling of chains . FERNANDO When you pray , friend , Turn your sour breath away from the wind . ( They settle . GARCIA lounges on steps , awake . ) QUADRADO ( Alone . ) Now I am left to walk the deck alone . The wind is high , the guards are at their poles , And on this minute , the ship boy should sing out . BOY 'S VOICE One glass is gone and now the third floweth .

You there on the watch , how is the passage ? LOOKOUT An open passage , high seas , please God , Lieutenant . QUADRADO There are flies on the cordage , flies , flies on these dead . And when I halt I hear their moans again . p. 17 FERNANDO ( Whispering ) Bartolome , look , Quadrado . . . QUADRADO All of my nights I sweat beads for the slain , Treading this deck as to a gallows tree . The frightened moon has scurried into her cave . The cold quicksilver sweat of fear breaks out And ghosts creep from the deep slime of the sea . ( MUSIC : figures of slaughtered Indians emerge from the shadows . ) COLUMBUS Light ! Light !

I was at my prayers , a custom You can put down to nothing and the troubled night . Is that the admiral 's supper ? Take it up . Wait ! ( GARCA drops back . ) Did you see nothing as you climbed the steps ? PACO Nothing but the shadows from the swinging lamp . QUADRADO You have not lost the gold I gave you , boy ? PACO No , my officer , I remember your catechism . QUADRADO Remember you have seen nothing , only a soldier Who can not sleep , and who has certain fears . That is the way you will meet your admiral . I must walk another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . ) PACO Your supper , Excellency . I have your supper . COLUMBUS You are half Indian , why are you on this ship ? PACO I am a grometto , I sing the " Salve " and reverse the glass . COLUMBUS I am not very hungry , boy . I am not well . PACO Even a god must eat , my admiral . COLUMBUS I am not a God , grometto. p. 19 PACO Eat , and I will talk out through the night with thee . ( Pause . ) Dost thou know of an officer called Quadrado ? COLUMBUS I knew many officers of several degrees . Why ? PACO He was a soldier , now he prays for Spain . COLUMBUS I am seaworthy , grometto , I need some sleep . There will be many nights ahead of this . PACO Were n't thou afraid of the great sea , my admiral ? COLUMBUS I see that you 'll have me talk no matter what . Well , perhaps it is best , than to remember sins . Yes , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PACO Yes , my admiral , in the God who was nailed up . BARTOLOME ( Below . ) It 's a bad passage . Garca , go to sleep . GARCIA Be quiet ; I 'll wake you for the watch . COLUMBUS There is a sea the Arabs knew , that scholars called Mare tenebricosum , the green sea of gloom . There , pass me the flat plate and I 'll show thee , boy . ( Holds up the plate . ) Before me , men thought the world 's design Was of this shape , the horizon , the plate 's edge , And on the rim of the world was hell and darkness . Now , assist me with this iron round my ankles . This , nio , is the certain shape of the world . p. 20 PACO ( Kneeling . ) Tell of the voyage , the monsters , and the lands . COLUMBUS And this spoon is Columbus beating on the gates Of the great princes of the world . A coin , A coin . I need a coin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coin . ) Place this gold here , a circle , like the sun That daily in its course turns round this iron And casts its shadow on one side , the night . The city I was born in , superb Genoa . Stares with her white breast southward to the sea , Into the sun , that at its summer solstice Sets like a burning carrack , fierce with fire , Behind the pinnacle of Mount Beguia . Turn up the lantern , and I 'll tell thee more . ( PACO takes down the lantern . ) I was a weaver 's son , strange how we start . While I worked patiently at my father 's shuttle , I could not guess the web of destinations That I would weave within the minds of men . QUADRADO ( Returns . ) So now he has an Indian for his friend ; the boy is safe . ( Exits . GARCIA creeps up steps. ) p. 21 PACO Seor , now may I have the coin ? COLUMBUS Thou art shrewd . Thou shouldst go the distance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his purse to my pocket . PACO Sit down , seor ; sit down , you are not well . COLUMBUS A little after sunset , one of my sailors Noticed the phosphorescence of the sea , And fishing in the glittering waters found A twig that had a bunch of withered berries on it . And there were other signs . The third day passed And so the dark descended on the sea . Sometimes it seemed we caught the scent of land . We waited , quiet , there was silence like this , There where the shadow of the steady helmsman Tosses upon the huge screen of the sail . Merely to breathe seemed an offence to faith . An hour before the lantern of the moon Climbed to the stair of heaven where no cloud Can mantle it , I thought I saw what what one might call a light . I called to my helmsman , Pedro Gutierrez , Whose eyes were best in the deceiving darkness . PACO What was the light , seor ? Were you afraid ? COLUMBUS ( Rises , distracted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , The fawning humiliation before great princes , The fears and terrors of the whale-threshed seas Broke through my cloud now , with his cry of light ! p. 22 PACO My admiral , my admiral , sit down , sit down . COLUMBUS Honours now hollow are heaped on my crest , Admiral of ocean , and a tamer of tides , What will they make of this world is my wonder ? Hypocrites and malefactors have wrecked my work . PACO . . . Excellency . . . COLUMBUS ( Sits . ) I had hoped to open the green page of this sea To be a book cartographers could read . Let me be buried in the backwash of oblivion , My bones unmarked , my grave a mystery , And some unlettered sea stone be my tomb . Yet I held a cross before me , O my Christ , I did all for God and the lion of Castile , I did all for God . . . ( He weeps . ) QUADRADO I shall get help , my admiral . . .

Who cried out ? p. 23 GARCIA Shut your mouth , fool ! Look in his shirt for the gold . He kicks like an animal . BARTOLOME Drag him here . FERNANDO Garca , for God 's sake , you 'll get us all in trouble . BARTOLOME Where 's the bright coin , little Indian ? He bit me . FERNANDO That 's enough for tonight , in the name of peace . Let go the Indian , you drunken fool . Look , here 's the officer . QUADRADO ( Enters . ) What is this , why has the admiral been kept in darkness ? PACO They tried to kill me for the coin , my officer . ( He runs over to QUADRADO , who draws his sword . ) GARCIA Put up thy trembling sword , cabrn , You can kill nothing but defenceless Indians . What will thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the times , Quadrado ? There , here 's new blood for thee . ( He squirts wineskin in his eyes . ) BARTOLOME Well , sure as Christ , we 'll all be hanged now . GARCIA There 's no difference in me and this officer . This is the one the Indians called Carnicero  --  the butcher . p. 24 PACO Kill him , kill him , my officer . GARCIA Before the affliction of his conscience , this one Spent all his energies subjugating Indians , Some by torture , some by terror , some in the mines . He did some service for the Tainos , too . Quadrado , You were not called that then , were you , Teniente ? PACO My officer , is this true ? QUADRADO Give the boy his coin , Garca . PACO ( Drawing back from QUADRADO . ) I want nothing from thee . I know of thee . FERNANDO Take it , nio , the officer was right . QUADRADO I have paid for it , I still pay for it now . I was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will follow who can learn evil better . These gestures of affection which I attempt , The evils I endure from all sorts of men , This hollow armour of my office , all , nio , I bear because I sought a change of heart . If this were blood that streamed now from my eyes , It would not have shook my pity five years ago . He knows this , and mocks it . I gave the coin Because I felt I owed thee some affection . It may be too late . p. 25 PACO ( Between QUADRADO and GARCIA . ) Oh , all of you , all of you , What must I believe ? What must I believe ? QUADRADO Grometto , do not judge any country by some persons , Or what its members have done thee ; there is only One race , grometto . Man . Go now , observe the glass .

He tells lies in all the inns , for drink , And he 's a foul old Spaniard . PACO Half , half , mate . The rest of this carcass is proud Indian , Tainos . ( Hopping around . ) Oh , it 's the biting cold I ca n't shake off by dancing . But a coin or two from you Christian boys , I 'll tell you . You 've heard tell of the great Admiral Columbus .

RALEIGH ( Spelling out letters . ) El Dorado , El Dorado . PACO Ah ! El Dorado , now , have you heard of that ? RALEIGH Yes , it 's in the west , but it 's a Spanish legend . PACO Legend , legend , he says , like a sceptical Christian .

Would that provoke a coin from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This El Dorado is a golden country , I showed it once to an officer called Quadrado . Oh , I 've tossed like an old cork on the seas of the world .

This bit of log , mates , Tells of a golden city in the green heart of Guiana , And these two words , they mean the gilded king . But it 'll take another coin to unlock my tongue . RALEIGH Then if this legend is so certain , Why have n't the Spanish found the city , sir ? ( They draw near him. ) p. 52 PACO ( Sits . ) Because out of the deep beliefs of their religion The cunning Indians kept the secret from them , For the Spanish , you know , destroyed my people . There 's many Spanish expeditions looked for it . They 're rusting in the emerald jungles now . It 's a far voyage . RALEIGH How far is it , old man ? PACO Far as I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perilous voyage , farther than Columbus , And farther than the great conquistadors have found , Men of the stamp of Corts and Quesada . Resilient men , formed in the Spanish temper , Who conquered Mexico and Montezuma , But this gold legend on this worm-riddled wood They 'll never find . GILBERT The English will . PACO Well , when you do , remember your old friend Paco . Look , mates , I 'll tell you a dying secret , but Would your cousin lend me the price of a jug ? GILBERT Give him a coin , cousin . Now , will you show us where ? ( RALEIGH complies . ) PACO ( Drawing on the sand . ) Thanks , little Christian . Well , this here 's the whale 's bath , The great Atlantic , where a great city drowned .

There 's a wolf 's cry on the wind , they 're coming . p. 53 GILBERT There are no wolves in this country . Do you fear dogs ? PACO I 've seen them tear men to pieces , all my flesh , For gold . Christian dogs besides . Go back from me . RALEIGH ( Drawing GILBERT aside . ) He is mad , cousin . Are you sick , sir ? PACO Dying on two worn feet , son , weary from walking Thousands of miles , all over the map of Europe . Tamoussi , Tamoussi , my own gods call me back . ( Staring wildly . ) Would you do me a favour in return , my sons ? GILBERT So , you frighten us . RALEIGH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we can . PACO There is an old wisdom which my tribe possessed . To tell the season of their coming death , the Tainos , By some scent in the wind , the altering of a feather , On the warm scent of the autumn-coloured fox . This wind carries the stench of rotting flesh . GILBERT It 's nothing but the old smell of the sea . PACO It is the sea that separates me from my gods , And brought destruction to my simple people . Come , do you know some high place in this country ? And leave me there , before the first snow comes ? p. 54 RALEIGH I know a height , barren with sea rocks , where You can sit quietly and watch the sinking west ; There 's nothing there .

Yes , I think I see the track . And so it goes , whatever track we take It leads us all to the cold height of death . I have strength enough to climb to it alone , That is the fashion in which my people die . Go , go back . I hear the wolf howling again . If you go to Manoa , death will find you there . Good night , you Christian boys , Paco is gone . RALEIGH Come , cousin , and take up the fragment of the vessel .

For a good friend , here , let me lean on your shoulder ; A good friend 's mind should be chameleon-like And take its colours from opposite affections . KEYMIS I find that somewhat parasitical , Sir Walter . RALEIGH Imagine yourself placed in my own position , Beyond these fireflies of the anchored fleet . You can discern the black leaves of a forest , So far translated into no civilized tongue . So once another admiral years ago Saw a prone country , still with its maidenhead , The virgin sea , through which no prow had entered , And sealed its nuptials in the name of Spain . Like me , his own impetuous , rebellious nature Offended monarchs ; he died disdained , obscurely . Above my own head hangs a thirsty axe ; The King , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a flick of the pen . ( He stares down the steps , followed by KEYMIS. ) p. 57 KEYMIS The King is more concerned with bargaining with the Spainard Than with your nature ; you are of a breed , sir , Against his policy . Who 's left in England now ? The admirals , earls , and boisterous captains Who shivered all the strength of Spain , her provinces , They are buried now , some in strange parts of the sea . RALEIGH And do you know by what he weighs us ? Gold . He spared me for that purpose . What time is it ? KEYMIS ( Moving towards table . ) It must be almost eight o'clock . And so I take it , Since we have burnt the town at Trinidad , An act that certainly should incense the King , And since we stand outside Guiana , full of doubts , That tomorrow we attack the fort at San Thome ?

RALEIGH No . As I stood here and you unrolled the map , With my life in the balances tomorrow , I remembered my boyhood and an old dim sailor , An old man with two worlds mixed in his blood , And a strange prophecy which he made to me . How sovereign death controls Guiana 's green , And that my voyages there would bring me death . ( Enter RALEIGH 'S SON , unobserved , with a lute . ) I saw in my condition of this giddy fever How the sea 's jaws swallowed Sir Humphrey Gilbert , And bones of Spanish conquerors mixed with vines .

( To KEYMIS ) Some days my mind is clear and crystal green , And perfect as a summer of the sea , and then A cloud of my uncertainty mantles it . SON It 's nothing but the fever , Father . RALEIGH Yes , but the gilding fever known as greed . Come , study the map , boy , you go with Captain Keymis . When I am absent , consider him your father . p. 59 KEYMIS ( Showing RALEIGH 'S SON . ) This lake here is the Rupununi , lying between The river Essequibo and the rio Branco . There is Canelos , a land of cinnamon trees . These are the tributaries which I charted , And this is the fort which we assault tomorrow . We are sure our prisoner , Governor de Berrio , Knows something of the site of this great city . ( The clock strikes eight . ) It has struck eight , shall I bring in the governor ? RALEIGH Yes , bring in the hypocrite . ( Exit KEYMIS . ) You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SON Father , are you afraid ? RALEIGH I feel so hollow , boy . Yes , I am afraid , But for you , too ; long memories disturb me . Know that I would not give your life , my son , For a roomful of all the jewels in Manoa . SON Why should I die , my lord ? Am I a bad soldier ? RALEIGH No , you do well , you do well . And here 's the governor . ( Enter BERRIO , KEYMIS . ) Seor de Berrio , my son who carries my name ; My friend and captain Laurence Keymis . Be seated , sir , and have some Spanish wine . p. 60 BERRIO Gracias . ( He sits . ) RALEIGH ( Pacing . ) Excellency , we will get down to business straight . Your Excellency has for some years been governor of Trinidad , Which is the door and gateway to the west . It is my confirmed impression , contradict me , That despite the pressing duties of your office On occasions you have conducted expeditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BERRIO ( Smiles . ) This is good Spanish claret , Seor Admiral . RALEIGH Do you recall a Captain Whiddon , Excellency ? BERRIO Yes , I know this English soldier Whiddon . I also know our countries are at peace , And that he broke our compact ; that English ships Attack our provinces in these islands , against the peace . Yes , I know Whiddon , and why you ask me that , To explain your sacking of the town of San Jos And justify the death of my own nephew . RALEIGH Perhaps Your Excellency might find it awkward To recall your treacherous  --  pardon me  --  surprising Entertainment of this English officer . p. 61 BERRIO ( Rises . ) Is this why I am brought before Your Excellency ? To exchange memoirs ? A week ago my men were massacred , The city I administered sacked and burnt . RALEIGH Much like your treatment of the Indians , seor . BERRIO ( Sits . ) We all did it once . Now they do it with Negroes . Unfortunately , that is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a power , seor ? BERRIO There is no Spain here now . It is a different thing to Europe , these are the Indies , With a different climate and a policy that must change . I think that despite Whiddon , whose death I sanctioned , That I was compensated , as you might say , enough . All that I built was burnt . We are at peace . RALEIGH Perhaps . But then why should I savour of an ass , With your honourable Spanish army at my back , When I must force my passage through Guiana ? BERRIO Why must , seor ? RALEIGH What ? BERRIO Why must you pursue this fable of Guiana ? Will that not mean a slaughtering of Indians ? p. 62 RALEIGH ( Shouts . ) I am not a Spaniard , man . KEYMIS Sir Walter . BERRIO ( Rising . ) No , I am a Spaniard and responsible to my country . And , you are English , your star in the ascendant . But to me you are a finished phenomenon , my friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Is of a finished age , the age of conquest , cruelty . The gold is veining out . KEYMIS Is that why you preach ? BERRIO As governor I pursued my Catholic precepts , Brought here by our first admiral and Las Casas , That what men take away out of a country They must restore by something else . Our mines are finishing , and the more profitable pursuits Of growing cities , establishing Christian culture , Is now the general concern , not avarice . The individual reputation must be dimmed , For the establishment of commerce , justice . I am the proconsul of a new empire , seor . KEYMIS Now will Your Excellency look at this map ? RALEIGH ( To BERRIO ) You tell me not to pursue my search for El Dorado . Must I presume , before the discoveries , Before Corts , Pizarro , Bilbo , Alczar There was no Montezuma , nor Peru ; in fact no gold .

Think all the world the property of Spain . But Spain is shattered , her wealth will be ours , I am not an even-tempered man , seor . SON Father , there is no need to be so angry with him . RALEIGH ( Turning on SON . ) I am your admiral , not your father now . ( Pause . ) KEYMIS Seor Berrio , do you recognise certain names here ? BERRIO ( Amused ) I see a map whose drawings are as haphazard As any I have done concerning this fable . KEYMIS And where is the best direction to this fable ? BERRIO I have a fatal statement for you gentlemen . RALEIGH Which is ? ( He sits . ) BERRIO There is no El Dorado . There is a story devised for malice by the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantis , it is like Columbus 's Cipango , like your own John Mandeville . The more you pierce Guiana and explore it , Pages of pages part before you , volumes of forest ; But El Dorado has no meaning , there are the bones Of ruined Spanish expeditions , and nothing else . p. 64 KEYMIS Yet you yourself have made cynical expeditions Of this nature . BERRIO That is why I speak . I can not warn you of the terrible expense When men or nations turn to beasts for gold . RALEIGH ( Rises angrily . ) Very well then , to be considered a beast ! Issue this order to the captains , Keymis . Despite the orders of the King of England , Despite the hypocrisy of this cunning Spaniard , Raleigh now risks his life , his soldiers ' lives , His son 's , and all the weight , experience Of his life , to find this fool 's gold and be King of it ! Burn down the Spanish fort and find Manoa , And now , seor , I wish you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have not seen him so angry for some time . He has a tongue that wounds his friends . BERRIO He is a sensitive but a dangerous man . If he is your friend , then I say , look again . He uses people . KEYMIS And you know nothing ? BERRIO Oh , you persistent English , I know nothing . I should like some rest . I wish him luck . But I know this will bring some terrible price . p. 65 SON My father is no coward , Seor de Berrio . BERRIO S , nio . No coward . But a frightened man . Good night . ( Exit BERRIO , KEYMIS . ) SON ( Picks up lute and sings . ) Gather ye money while ye may , Old Time is still a-flying , And that same price you raised today Tomorrow will be dying . That yellow coin of heaven , the sun , The higher he 's a-getting . Pursue him still and you may run A profit ere his setting . So be you wise and be you bold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that 's bought and sold . So sing hey money , money .

Now get to bed . SON How is your fever ? You should rest , Father . RALEIGH I have the fever and I can not rest , I think of my responsibility , and each man 's life , Of your sweet mother , of how greed makes men mad , And that dull ache of absence called a wife .

Lower the longboat there for Captain Keymis . Can you shout what you see there , fellow ? SAILOR Aye , aye , sir . It 's the expedition , they 're launching the skiffs , and it seems they 've got a couple wounded , though I ca n't make out who , sir . They 're down to the brown shallows of the river , and there 's some getting into the boats by the jungle 's edge . RALEIGH Get ready to brace them aboard , I 'm coming down .

There he lies , on the unknown world , my son . KEYMIS We must return to England now , Sir Walter . RALEIGH I weigh this body of my finished son Against , sweet Christ , a little mound of gold , But God , who sacrificed Thy Son Thyself , Temper my grief , rib me with fortitude .

Believe me , as his friend and captain . RALEIGH Or to speak the truth , his captain and his butcher . Butcher ? I know the quantity of your suffering , But I was his friend when he lived . You know it . RALEIGH Take him away , the lute , map , everything ; but Keymis , If you are as honest as you say you are , then look , And take his murder as your own negligence . ( The body is borne away . ) KEYMIS Come back here , man ! Do you call me back to abuse me , then , Sir Walter , Here in the full view of the common sailors , To the contempt and pity of the enemy ?

Remember , We searched for Guiana many times before this . Then it was dear Laurence , friend , exchanger of my love . It was your fever that infected mine . We have failed , And execution waits for us in England , But God , I had preferred to slaughter Indians uselessly Than to endure this malice from a gentleman . BERRIO Gentlemen , seores . I lost a nephew to your soldiers .

If you ca n't ack like a gentleman in a respectable British colony , then all I could say to you is you should be ashamed of yourself . A sailor of His Majesty 's navy , a Englishman , and drunk as a lord on the demon rum . And look here , too , besides , friend . I not one of these common nigger men you see working down by the carenage hauling spiders and getting on like they ai n't got self-respeck for their owners , yuh !

You not in St. Kitts , Antigua , or St. Lucia , or one of them nasty French places , and I consider you should be ashamed of yourself ! You have a responsibility to protect these British colonies with vessels , and so discharge them according to your service , before I take your name and number !

GENERAL LECLERC , GENERAL and MADAME DE ROUVRAY . Liveried NEGRO LACKEYS . Night . The garden . Wine is served . GENERAL LECLERC It 's not quite as terrible as one had imagined , This heat , I mean , General . In France one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweltering heat , Yet your garden is cool , and the view is excellent . DE ROUVRAY You will find it almost wintry later , in the mountains . You can imagine what terrain it is for a revolt . I have very little sentiment in surrendering my command . GENERAL LECLERC And you , Madame de Rouvray ? MADAME DE ROUVRAY You know wives , General Leclerc . This is what I shall miss , the supervision of my gardens , I hope Madame Pauline will look after these lilies . Monsieur Calixte , I know , will understand my misery , Being himself the paragon of planters . CALIXTE-BREDA I can understand , madame . I comprehend completely your devotion to lilies . p. 80 MADAME DE ROUVRAY And since Madame Pauline is absent , General , Perhaps you can tell us of the situation in Paris . DE ROUVRAY She probably means the fashions , but , my dear Emilie , General Leclerc is more proficient at uprooting rebellions Than in describing Paris couture and the qualities of flowers . GENERAL LECLERC It has altered considerably since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned , full of enthusiasm , So perhaps Monsieur Anton  --  it is Anton , is it not , monsieur ? Perhaps this silent gentleman is the best one to ask . MADAME DE ROUVRAY Haiti has also altered . Things are terribly unsettled . Is there much similarity , in your opinion , Anton ? ( ANTON moves away . ) CALIXTE-BREDA When Anton drinks too much wine , as he did here at dinner , The boy falls into an unshakeable melancholy . MADAME DE ROUVRAY Do you think Madame Leclerc may have met with an accident ? It is dangerous to be riding these roads at night alone . GENERAL LECLERC ( Smiles . ) My wife is not alone . I think she should be safe . p. 81 DE ROUVRAY You see there is always the danger of runaway slaves ; Then , there are serpents . . . MADAME DE ROUVRAY And so many other dangers , monsieur . There are hazards much more subtle in a colonial society . CALIXTE-BREDA ( Laughs . ) I resent that word , excuse me , " colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite innumerable hazards . The danger , though concealed of a mixed aristocracy , The ambushes that wait for one under glittering candles , The serpents in the smiles of the most charming hostess , Arrows of eyebrows , and artilleries of slander Behind the barricades of those fluttering fans . . . GENERAL LECLERC You do n't like the word " colonial " ? This , I presume , then , is the birth of a nation ? Generals who were slaves , each one a black Spartacus . You know , Napoleon calls them gilded Africans . DE ROUVRAY They are becoming quite formal in their conduct of this war . GENERAL LECLERC ( Impatiently ) This is not a war , de Rouvray , it is a large-scale civic action . I am employed to subjugate a province of France . p. 82 ANTON Do not be so sure , One must never underrate the authority of the people . CALIXTE-BREDA Slaves are not people , they are intelligent animals . MADAME DE ROUVRAY Gentlemen , please , let us not lose our tempers . ANTON Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . GENERAL LECLERC So at last we grow eloquent . You say the will of the people . Let us tell you , monsieur , that that expression is a fallacy . Remember it was the people who demanded Barabas . ANTON This is the philosophic corruption of power . CALIXTE-BREDA Anton , you are a guest . GENERAL LECLERC It is a fact , nevertheless , despite your enthusiasm , The people have always chosen their particular demon . They created their Caesar as they created Napoleon . But you have been reading Rousseau and Montesquieu , They are romantics overcome by the odours of the mob . ANTON ( Impatiently ) This is Caesarism . DE ROUVRAY Anton , it 's discussion . p. 83 ANTON That is monarchy . And you , a republican . GENERAL LECLERC You sound angry , young man . I am a cynic who worships order . I doubt such things exist as liberty or good marriages . Do n't you consider yourself superior to your uncle 's Negroes ? ANTON ( Controlling himself ) Monsieur , you are a general , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit that walks over the earth . GENERAL LECLERC I know , I was part of it . Libert , galit , fraternit . And what has this turned into but democratic despotism ? CALIXTE-BREDA ( Smiling . ) Then you believe in the monarchy ? Or are you testing our allegiance ? GENERAL LECLERC Show me a good man and I will show you a good nation . Do you know what will happen if your revolution succeeds ? There will not be liberty but mere patterns of revenge . The history of man is founded on human nature , and We can not exorcise the guilt of original sin . DE ROUVRAY Does the First Consul know what opinions you hold , General ? p. 84 GENERAL LECLERC What does it matter ? I am an excellent general , And then I am fortunate , my wife is Caesar 's sister . And here in good time , she arrives with a new province . ( Enter PAULINE LE CLERC with young officer . ) PAULINE Now I shall not say anything dull or unpredictable But that I forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conversation of generals can be ; I have a haphazard memory , and so all is forgiven . This is Lieutenant Foujade ; my husband , General Leclerc ; Your commander , General de Rouvray ; Madame de Rouvray . This is Monsieur Calixte , Oh , this is so absurd , ( Before ANTON ) And this . . . CALIXTE-BREDA My nephew , madame . Monsieur Anton Calixte . PAULINE Oh yes , yes indeed . Can I have a drink with you ? Lieutenant Foujade is an authority on Haiti . We toured a few estates , including yours , Monsieur Calixte . He knows all about factories , we toured the compounds , So if I reek a little of the parfum d'Afrique , Endure it gently . There seems to have been trouble . CALIXTE-BREDA It is normal , they shake the chains a little . p. 85 LIEUTENANT FOUJADE It seemed worse than that , monsieur . A few seem to have escaped . CALIXTE-BREDA There are ways of retrieving them , It is an industrial hazard . There are dogs , you observe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am so sorry , forgive me ? MADAME DE ROUVRAY Not at all . LIEUTENANT FOUJADE If you will excuse me , messieurs , madame . Please accept my apologies , sir , but we were delayed . GENERAL LECLERC C'est normal . ( Exit LIEUTENANT FOUJADE . ) Now , if Monsieur Calixte will accompany us . We can talk out these problems with a tour of the garden And leave your eloquent nephew to chat with the ladies . Nothing is more monotonous than the small talk of soldiers . You say , then , de Rouvray , that the most efficient generals , For want of a better term , are this fellow Boukmann , Dessalines , and . . . the other . . . what 's his name ? DE ROUVRAY Christophe . . . Monsieur Calixte knows all about this also . He has helped me enormously , he knows the country thoroughly . . . I hate mountain country , you never finish a war . . . ( Exit GENERALS and CALIXTE-BREDA. ) p. 86 PAULINE Then are you packed and ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I feel so archaic , so dated in the fashion . I trust Haiti will not bore you , it is different from Paris . There is little to do that one can call civilised . It is rich , but vulgar , as you may well have observed . PAULINE Oh , one creates one 's pleasures to suit every country . But what does one do that is different from Paris ? I have grown so tired of false dukes and society . MADAME DE ROUVRAY What does one do in fact that is not imitation ? Perhaps Anton could tell us . Men have all the liberties . ANTON Is madame in search of something exciting and different ? PAULINE It begins to sound exciting before you even describe it . ANTON Then I must have another glass before I proceed . But as a general 's wife , I am sure you have seen much . Industrial hazard , as my uncle observed . . . MADAME DE ROUVRAY Anton is still sullen , He has just lost an argument to your husband . p. 87 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dispassionate . But tell us , monsieur . ANTON Well , quite recently , madame , We have devised a spectacle of epic proportions . ( Pauses , studies their faces . ) There is a place in the city , designed like an arena , Half shadow in the afternoon , say , on some boring Sunday ,  --  Sunday afternoons are the same in every part of the world ,  --  Where a carnivorous spectacle is gaining popularity . MADAME DE ROUVRAY ( Agitatedly ) Anton , please . Madame Leclerc did not mean that . ANTON The Negroes , you know , are punished in public . They are led into his arena , as in a public circus , And then , with some brief ceremony , the theatre commences . . . MADAME DE ROUVRAY If you will excuse me , I must finish my packing . It is getting late , and there are things I must do . Good night , madame ; good night , Anton . ( She exits . ) PAULINE You were saying , monsieur ? ANTON The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into noses , ears , and mouths . Then the actors are fixed into farcical positions , Then the powder is lit , and the victims are exploded . ( Laughs . ) Of course , no one is permitted to act his role twice . Is that sufficient ? p. 88 PAULINE If you have finished . ANTON Do not miss the meaning , there are other diversions , For there is this ballet of putting them into holes . PAULINE Holes ? ANTON De grands trous , comme a . They are buried in the ground to their necks in these holes . They are then smeared with honey and the ants erode them . There is some species of ant that can strip human flesh ; Then often there are dogs , which are trained for that purpose . That is our theatre , but it is rather repetitious . PAULINE It is not worse than war . Have you watched it yourself ? ANTON ( Sits . ) That is why I can describe it , I am torn apart also . My head is reeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAULINE Then why do you watch it ? ANTON Why , madame ? I will tell you why . Because I am torn to pieces with them , I am myself a division . By the fact that I am half African and half French , I must become both spectator and victim . It is amusing . Do n't you understand what I am telling you , madame ? I am not the nephew of Monsieur Armand Calixte : I am His son , illegitimate ; all society knows this , but It is not said directly . p. 89 PAULINE Who is your mother , then ? ANTON She was a slave of his mansion . He recognised her in darkness , in that republic And that act in which complexions do not matter . What do I do ? Many years ago , I was tempted to admit it , To be what I am and not be ashamed , a Haitian . Then I saw our two delegates to the French General Assembly , Og and Chavannes , broken on the wheel in public . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAULINE You are upset , monsieur ; come and sit down a little . And you do not understand why you are telling me this ? ANTON Should I speak the truth to you , Madame Leclerc ? PAULINE Yes , it is still the best thing , to follow one 's impulses , To avoid hurting others and destroying one 's sanity . ANTON Look , we own an excellent coachman , his name is Toussaint , He is a Negro of a most remarkable docility . I know he loves my father , he loves me as his son , But since such cruelty and this new liberty of man Have made Haiti a crisis in the history of this age , I have seen his black face tormented with division , Between duty to his people and the love of our family . How am I better than Toussaint , greater than his anguish ? Compared to him I am nothing . Do you know what I should do ? I should hate all this elegance , to sit among the slaves , Be mocked for an ape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choked to death with these silks . . . ( He struggles with his collar. ) p. 90 PAULINE Anton , please , please . . . ( Pause . ) Is that all you wish to tell me ? ANTON You know it is not all . How can that be all ? ( Pause . ) Since the first night I saw you , the centre of attention In the glittering ballroom at Madame de Rouvray 's mansion , Barricaded by lieutenants , and then once again tonight , White and lovely as the moon , and equally remote , My body trembled at the minute of your entrance . ( GENERAL LECLERC appears on the balcony above . ) PAULINE You talk too much , Anton . ANTON I must talk of these things . PAULINE No , let them go ; as women do , take life as it comes . ANTON And yes , and this destroys me , I try to understand things , But it is sad , it is sad , the whole thing is sad . It is sad to see belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries making old mistakes . One could hope from the past the present would be simple , But it is sad to see only the repetition of desire . PAULINE ( Taking his head to her bosom . ) It is like the first years of love , understanding is hard . . . There now , let me kiss you ; forget the hate of this world . Learn to love one person and your view will be mellowed . ( They kiss . LECLERC descends , unseen. ) p. 91 TOUSSAINT ( Enters . ) Monsieur Anton . Ton pre te demande . ANTON This is our coachman , Toussaint . What is it ? GENERAL LECLERC ( Emerging . ) It appears there is some trouble again on his estate , The slaves are burning the canes , you can see the glow . There behind the mountains . He is rather anxious , he wants You to help him with a hunt . I 'll lend him soldiers . ANTON I can not help him , sir . Dtes lui ma kai venir Toussaint . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Allez . TOUSSAINT Monsieur Anton . . . ANTON Allez , allez . I am not hunting tonight . ( Exit TOUSSAINT . ) It is not far , I know a path through the fields . GENERAL LECLERC Do you think that you are in any condition to walk ? I can lend you a horse if you insist on returning . ANTON No , I am going alone . I thank you . Good night , good night , madame . ( He exits . ) GENERAL LECLERC A remarkable young man , very stubborn , very passionate . p. 92 PAULINE I presume that you saw us kissing from the balcony . GENERAL LECLERC We retain our understanding , I am your brother 's general , And you remain his ambassador for foreign affairs . ( They go off . Glare of fire  --  drums .

ANTON ( Singing . ) Oh , the moon may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereign light . ( He stops , laughs . ) The moon , the moon , it was that remarkable metaphor of the moon that startled her . Anton , you are a fool . She slaughters men as her husband does battalions . . . Well , she has uprooted me also . You are drunk and a fool . Oh , let me thank my fool of a father , Monsieur Armand Calixte , otherwise how should I have met her ? Ah well , I have done this before , only I will not hunt men like animals , I am not a hunter of men . What was that sound ? It seems as if the whole country is on fire . I think I must be lost . Think , if I were not of this complexion now , she and that fat Madame de Rouvray and her stupid husband would have been amused to see me exploded with saltpetre , ripped by hounds . Ha .

Torrential rain fights with the fire of the city . DESSALINES , soaked , watches the scene with some OFFICERS . A shed . A SOLDIER passes . DESSALINES You there , soldat ! SOLDIER Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , me , Christophe , which , hein ? SOLDIER With General Toussaint , General Dessalines . DESSALINES In your cloak there , rum , non ? Bring it here , ngre , and give your general a drink . Look at it burn , look . Remember this , this is the turning of a century , ngre . Oh , it pleases me . I could wash my face , Sergeant , in the handful of its ashes . Tell me , I love to hear it , what city is that ? ( He drinks . ) SOLDIER That is Les Cayes , mon general , and we have scattered the forces of the mulatto Rigaud . The worst enemy of our new black republic . DESSALINES There must be one hundred thousand slaughtered there . Burn , burn , city of contagions , consume it all . Though God poured out the whole basin of this sky He could not drench that fire . Go , leave the bottle . You , there , you soldiers . In what quarter of the town Is General Christophe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

CHRISTOPHE ( Collapses on a stool . ) Poor country . This is not a war . DESSALINES No , it is not war . But it will do for now . Here , drink ! I understand you had a difficult assault ? CHRISTOPHE You said assault ? This butchering of mulattoes you call assault ? You 'll catch a chill there , sitting in the rain . Lend me a cloth , my own is soaked with blood . DESSALINES Here , have this shirt , I sent for dry boots and linen . Well , where is our excellent commander L'Ouverture ? CHRISTOPHE I thought that he was working close to you . DESSALINES No , I had an easy quarter A cowardly segment of Rigaud 's mulatto army , Oh , look ! There must be one hundred thousand dead out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they smell wonderful , do n't they ? Burnt flesh and trampled muck and sweating rain . It is only two o'clock , and dark as an eclipse . DESSALINES The pot is overturned , up in the north ; the news is this , That bloody , murderous slaughterer Sonthonax , Boukmann , the Jamaican , and other rebellious regiments Have burned the plains into a smoking shambles . CHRISTOPHE They burn the crops , but when peace has returned . . . And which of them has yet conquered Leclerc ? DESSALINES Up in the north two thousand whites are slaughtered . The flame is catching in the unharvested canes , Not only in this island , but through the Antilles . We have sent agents to stir up this violence . Drink , drink . Here , two hundred estates destroyed . The black wolves Of our marauding soldiers , swollen by famine , Have sacked the indigo and coffee fields . It will spread Even in the British territories . In Martinique , Guadeloupe . CHRISTOPHE I only wish I had your sense of theatre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture of Toussaint ? DESSALINES The yellow fever has wrecked the French battalions . The time has come , with Leclerc 's forces weakened , For us to strike some temporary pact . As you remember , He offered to withdraw his forces of occupation If we hand over Toussaint to Napoleon . Oh , this Napoleon , He is such an egotist . He thinks that Toussaint 's capture Would weaken us . Oh , mon Dieu , mi blague , I could laugh , laugh . p. 100 CHRISTOPHE There is no one the Corsican hates more than this ape , This  --  what does he call him  --  " This gilded African . " We sell him ? DESSALINES One thing perturbs me . Pass me the bottle , friend . One thing perturbs poor Dessalines : we are four armies , And all assembled under distinctive generals , you , me , Toussaint , Maurepas . But of all of us , Toussaint Has grown most power drunk . He has monarchic aims , I know . CHRISTOPHE Let us not lie to ourselves . We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not excuse it , hein ? You think he 'll set himself up as Emperor ? How do you know ? DESSALINES ( Laughs . ) I have a parrot that speaks to me in my dreams . Look ! Napoleon thinks of the whole world as his empire , yet This ape has beaten him , outwitted his best generals . And since Napoleon thinks in terms of a late Caesar , He thinks this ape , encaged , will resolve the war . Even Leclerc , who is a cynic and no fool , believes it . And as you say , this is not war . Yet how I love it , Look at it burn . This is more than war , it is revolt ; It is a new age , the black man 's turn to kill . p. 101 CHRISTOPHE Then we are no better . Revenge Is very tiring . Please do not hog the bottle . Where does all that leave the mulatto , Dessalines ? DESSALINES ( Pointing . ) There , out there dead in the stinking rain . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here comes our bill of sale .

TOUSSAINT ( To the officers . ) We have scattered Rigaud , but we still have enemies Here on the soil of our beloved Haiti : Leclerc , his armies ; Yet we have allies also , the fever , and our great zeal To make this country greater than it was . Revenge is nothing . Peace , the restoration of the burnt estates , the ultimate Rebuilding of those towns war has destroyed , peace is harder . We strike our march in the next hour . Collect your troops . ( A bugle is blown . OFFICERS exit . ) DESSALINES Your lungs are iron , to still have breath to speak , Some rum ?

TOUSSAINT Yes , yes , but I hate excess . ( He washes his hands . ) DESSALINES ( Roars with laughter . ) Ho , ha ! He kills ten thousand or more defenceless citizens Who did him no harm but that their colour was wrong And shrugs his shoulders and says he hates excess . oh , oh I love , I kiss this hypocrite !

CALIXTE-BREDA ( Angrily ) You call this compulsion , this slaughtering of children , This dedicated erasure of any complexion ?

Until today , You are blood drunk , since that first boy you murdered . p. 105 TOUSSAINT Murdered ? Boy ? CALIXTE-BREDA My son , my son Anton , that was so far You have forgotten it . You have seen so many dead , Now that war makes your butchery legimate . ( He draws his pistol . ) TOUSSAINT Put down the pistol , Monsieur Calixte . Your son ? What son ? He was your nephew then .

I have learnt to pick up a child Limp on my sword 's edge as you would lift an insect ; I have to learn this .

Your Excellency , gentlemen of this assembly , fellow Jamaicans , In the history of nations , the birth of their spirit , There can be no last battle . For the history of man Is continual conflict , with himself , with his enemies . The potential of a country is the mass of its people . That torrent may be poisoned by the discolouring intellect Of ambitious conquerors , and the blame is theirs . Your Excellency suggests patience , to be satisfied with progress , The evolution of our society , the dissolution of prejudice , But human truths can not be concealed in a pact . The history of these islands has been tragic from birth , Their soils have been scoured , their peoples forgotten , While the powers of Europe struggled for possession . And when that wealth has been drained , we have been abandoned . ELIJAH Your horse is ready , Mr. Gordon . GORDON I am coming down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the constitution . This may flout the government , result in rebellion . But I am prepared for this also , we must not be satisfied . I risk my life for this ; if we ask for these liberties . We are seeking what is natural . p. 117 ELIJAH Mr. Gordon , you going be late , suh . Dem have plenty people gathering round the courthouse . And is a long ride to Kingston . You best come now . GORDON If one last battle , which remains to be fought , Means the absolute freedom of those who have suffered With patience , faith , and humour , I shall incite that battle . I am compelled , at the risk of hanging for that truth , To tell this country , and these islands , the meaning of liberty : That it must be fought for , regardless of its price . Does it sound good to you , Elijah ? ELIJAH Sound good enough , sir , For them to put a rope round your neck . Come , sir , Kingston .

CHORUS That web Columbus shuttled took its weave , Skein over skein to knit this various race , Though warring elements of the past compounded To coin our brotherhood in this little place . And now , Time 's steward , memory , hoists his mace , Quadrado 's ghosts whirl backwards in a wind , The foam laurels those sailors fished so deep , Those marching men , those horns and seas we sounded , That all night long split the unquiet sky , Faint , in the dim shell of the echoing mind , And the past turns to its forgetful sleep . Return again , where buried actions lie , For time is such , alternate joy and pain , Those dead I raised have left us vows to keep . Look , a new age breaks in the east again . ( Lights full up .
