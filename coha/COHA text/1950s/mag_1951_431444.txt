 | " What ! You 're still living at home ! " said my new friend amusedly . " Whatever for ? " Once again I went into the familiar , once-over-lightly explanation of my old-fashioned taste in living arrangements . But my listener was n't a bit convinced by my rather moth-eaten exposition . It was plain that he thought an unmarried girl of twenty-three , making enough money to be able to live on her own , must be mildly neurotic not to grasp as much independence as possible . In spite of my somewhat anxious assurance that I had spent a year living alone in Paris and four years away at college , I could imagine him thinking , Probably tied in some unhealthy way to her mother ? or else she just ca n't see paying her own rent bill . Later I realized that my reaction to the where-do-you-live question had sounded fuzzy and rather on the defensive side , so I was driven to ask myself why , after all , the possibility of a separate existence does n't seem more alluring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? or hung about with apron strings ? Or are there good reasons for my living at home ? You bet there are ! 57 @#  | My basic reason is so obvious that when I first started digging about , I almost missed it . I like my parents . It 's not just that I love them ; they 're people enjoy spending time with , people I . choose as friends ( not merely as relatives ) . And because I like them ? ar they like me ? we 're willing to put u ; with as much from one another as we c : from our other friends . Because there is real communicatic-. and unself-conscious friendliness between my parents and me , I can luxuriate in one of the greatest advantage of living at home : I do n't ever have : . be lonely .

OF COURSE , there is another side this quality my parents have of beie : interested in everything I tell the : : I mean the innumerable petty questio : : - that obscure the story I 'm telling touch too ' closely on the things I 'm r telling . There 's no doubt that I have - : resign a small measure of personal id erty to respond constantly to " WI : : - time did you get in ? " or " Who are t : people you double dated with ?

No need -a convince myself there 's nothing like a quiet evening at home , because there is n't ? not when home means warm : : and relaxed , loving companionship Ir.  - -  stead of the emptiness of an emancipa -- i and solitary career girl 's apartmer The other solution to the problem : - loneliness is sharing an apartment w : ? -.  | a couple of other girls , but I have n't ec this for two reasons : I have n't any girls whose company would more continually interesting than of my parents , and I think that a in kind of privacy is more possible my own home than in a big-city version of my chummy old dormitory life . I ca n't pretend that even in our cheerfully gregarious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to time . WHEN I came back from Paris almost two years ago and decided to live at e , I knew that for the sake of future ony it was vital that I have a room my own . Luckily , I was able to take r the room I used to share with my ter ; I camouflaged our old furniture adding my personal atmosphere : my ks , my Flea Market " antiques , " my ' er , my disorder , and my favorite ' ors on the walls and at the window . t of all , there 's a firm understanding ut the on-invitation-only status of : tors . My brother would n't stroll in borrow my records without asking , my mother would n't dream of coming to clean out my dresser drawers or - range my closet . If my door is sed , anyone who wants to come in ocks first . They all understand that if feel I have to be alone , I 'm not sulking brooding . No one 's feelings are hurt I decide , after dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all , reread old love letters , or : te new ones , in front of a family ? or family television set ? As I expect privacy and my own room , ' s only fair that my financial position the house be clearly understood . As it ppens , my parents do n't want me to pay ard , and I feel that in this case the rely symbolic gesture of independence volved in paying board is n't awfully portant . But if my help were needed , know we could arrive , by a sensible , nk discussion of the family budget , at good solution . As things stand now , I ve the satisfaction of being able to take re of all personal expenses , including ctor 's and dentist 's bills , clothes , and cations , and to save some money be-des . Mercenary or not , I must admit at it 's most agreeable to be able to ord new books and hats , special hristmas presents , and unnecessary is . And , most satisfactory of all , I can ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consult anyone but myself about ow much I can afford to contribute . If do n't work after I 'm married , I wo n't ave as much money of my own for charity ? and somehow , when you give money you have earned , it means the most . Although a room of my own , comfort , and being able to spend my money as I like would never be inducement enough to remain at home were other , more worth-while considerations lacking , they do add fun and freedom to the proposition . And how I 'm enjoying them while they last ! The physical privacy I enjoy at home would n't mean a great deal if it were n't accompanied by a certain mental privacy , a sort of mutual respect that exists because my parents do n't have that itch t : run their children 's lives . Sometimes I do n't realize until after my problems have been resolved how deliberately my parents have avoided trying to influence me unfairly . Last year , when I was deciding whether or not to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after I 'd decided not to , that he had n't liked the idea . If I 'd really felt that the marriage would have been right for me , my parents would have let me go ahead . This policy is followed on less importan : issues : they do n't tell me who not to gc out with , nor do they object to some o : my more exotic friends . And if I have busy week , they do n't look hurt or ac : neglected when I 'm out for dinner five nights in a row . I OFTEN ask my parents ' advice on personal puzzles , because they natural : : . know much more than I about human nature and all the forms of daily protocol . Their advice is likely to be more valuable than that of my friends , as the ? . do n't give me the easy answer I want ' hear , nor do they try to work out the : - frustrations through me , like my frier. with the year-old twins who keeps advi , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : to Live ! Of course , my opinions and actions an . somewhat affected by my parents ' attitudes , unemphasized though they ma : . be , because of my faith in their judgment . But , for heaven 's sake , wh ? : should n't they be ? I admit to a lot of influences on me ? the friends I lunch wit : . my sister , the men I go out with , tl. ? people I work with , friends of the fami ' . ' : and random professors ? so why not nt. parents , too ? They have , it seems to nn a certain right . Of course , there 's no denying the fa. : that I often do get unasked-for commentabout casual , unimportant things I from my aware parents . When I 'm dressc to go to the theatre and I 've decided risk a tiny beauty patch near my e : . : ( feeling in an eighteenth-century mood . my father is certain to hoot unfeeling : My mother may well meditate , looking : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see now why I never thought strait : : : skirts were right for your hips . " B .. : what can you do ? Even very understan ing people are n't going to deny then -- selves these privileges of parentho And , come to think of it , I criticize the- .. too . Neither my mother 's hats , r.v father 's ties , nor my brother 's haire. : I escapes my attention , and they do n't huffy about it . There 's one other inevitable anno ? . ante about living at home . I have to . my family know in advance all my plan and projects , so that they wo n't wo . about where I am . An impulsive ride c to the country must be interrupted , p : - saically , to phone that I wo n't be hofor dinner . There 's no dodging the t. that it 's hampering to feel that : whereabouts are always known a commented on . On the other hand , so .. day it might be good to know t. someone cares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me if I 'm stukeep me company if I 'm suddenly da : less on Saturday night , or be anxio about me if I 'm sick . I always feel sorry for my friends who live alone they have to endure a cold in the he without anyone to make orange jua for them ! I 've sometimes been tempted by thought of a one-room apartment : 1 would express only me ? not just my room made over but a charming , is vidual setting . The kind of place about which my friends might say , " Oh , darling . It 's so you . " Yet , as a matter of fact prefer entertaining at home , because I 've  | discovered it gives me a background that nothing else can provide . And by background I do n't mean an heirloom silver set or family portraits , but rather the solid permanence of belonging , visibly , to an agreeable family tradition of easy hospitality . My parties , though always Informal , often spur-of-the-moment events , have always profited from that air of accustomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a date , especially if it 's a blind date , there 's a certain pleasant dignity in asking the man to pick me up at home and in introducing him to my family before we leave . Although I like to think of myself as a liberated , modern young woman , I find that a little bit of ceremony never hurts . New York , like any other big city , is a town in which the fact that a girl lives alone indicates something pretty definite to some young men . Fair game , perhaps , or " girl on the town . " All my friends who live alone te.i me that never before have they had to beat off so many amorous advances , and never have their refusals been received with such indignant surprise . Without being a prude about it , I 've oaten been grateful for the tacit protect:on of the family living room . Any combustible guy is easier to handle under the paternal roof than he is in a bachelorgirl setup , no matter how well the girl can take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good feeling of security ? a home base that I can count on while I 'm busy hacking my way through the jungle of New York social life . FINALLY , in spite of any of the normal tensions and conflicting elements involved in living at home , I keep sensing one irreplaceable pleasure it has given me : the chance to know my parents on an adult level . When I was busy with high school and away at college , I did n't have the time , or perhaps the imagination , to consider my mother and father as personalities in their own right , and I lacked much of the maturity needed to meet them as friends . After I 'm married , I 'll have such a complicated life of my own that I wo n't have much time to spend with my parents . But in these years between school and marriage , I do have leisure for those long conversations , those exchanges of opinion , experience , and gossip , that strengthen any friendship . Such hours of adult talk ? at twilight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks in the park ? were never possible before I was an independent person , with a life of my own . These years probably are the most enjoyable for parents ; after they have gone through all the aches and pains of bringing up kids , they should be able to relish comfortably the almostfinished product . So the next time someone eyes me with sophisticated skepticism and asks me why I live at home , I 'll have so many reasons that after the first half hour , he 'll rue his curiosity . Of course , it mostly adds up to the fact that I still live at home because I 'm just plain lucky I have parents who are wise enough to make it a wonderful experience . Although , as my mother often reminds me , she does n't want me to like it so very much that I wo n't pack up and leave some day soon , She wants to begin to enjoy some grandchildren !                   @ @
