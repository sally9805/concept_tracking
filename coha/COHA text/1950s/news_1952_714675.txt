txt Spileal to Two Now Tome TIMES . PHILADELPHIA , May ** Truman s Administration , through Vice President Alben W. Barkley and S. -- cretary of Labor Maurice J. Tobin , gave unqualified support today to the United Steelworkers of America , C.I.O. , in its fight to win wage increases , a union shop and other benefits recommended by the Wage Stabilization Board . The Administration 's support was pledged as 3,000 delegates to the union 's sixth constitutional convention voted unanimously to strike unless the 600,000 workers in the basic steel mills got quick action on a new wage agreement . The resolution set no deadline for a fresh walkout in plants that produce 95 per cent of the nation 's steel , but union leaders said the strike would begin at once if the United States Supreme Court ended Government possession of the steel industry . A ruling is possible within the next three weeks . Vice President Barkley told the convention that it was as " unAmerican " for any group to defy a decision of the Wage Board as it was to reject the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the union would come out of the present dispute with a " victory . " Secretary Tobin was even more unreserved in his affirmation of support for the union . He said the union 's willingness to accept the W. S. B. recommendations had put him " heart and soul and spirit " behind the steel workers in their fight . Amid cheers from the union delegates , Mr. Tobin asserted that he felt no obligation to be im // partial in the dispute . He said the " time for impartiality " had passed when the Wage Board handed down its recommendations and the industry refused to join the union in accepting them . Mr. Tobin condemned the companies for their refusal to go along with " the decision of a fair umpire , " and praised the union 's conduct throughout the controversy as " a shining example of responsible trade unionism : ' The industry has stressed that the rules established by President Truman to govern the Wage Board 's handling of labor disputes do not require either side to comply with the board 's decisions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increases proposed by the board without offsetting price increases . Mr. Tobin took issue with this contention in his talk to the union . He asserted that the actual cost to the industry ' of granting all the board proposals would be " less than 65 cents a ton " if the companies accepted the price rise of $3 a ton already authorized under the Capehart Amendment to the Defense Production Act , a formula to permit certain price increases since the Korean war . Murray Cites Price Aspects Philip Murray , president of the steel union , told the delegates that the industry had made all its wage offers contingent on increased prices . The highest wage offer put forward by the companies has been an increase of 121/2 cents an hour in basic pay , plus 5.4 cents an hour in fringe benefits . Under the Wage Board recommendations , the union would get 121/2 cents an hour , retroactive to last Jan. 1 , a second increase of 21 , ; cents an hour July 1 and a third 21/2 cents next Jan. 1 . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains this year and another 3.5 cents next year . Present steel wages , including overtime , average $1.83 an hour . Steel prices average $110 a ton . The union delegates made it plain that they were eager for a prompt showdown in the steel mills . The union 's old contract with the major steel companies expired on New Year 's Eve and a dozen rank - and-file representatives took the convention floor to demand that the members " hit the bricks " to force action on a new contract . When the resolution calling for ' a quick settlement was put up for a vote , all 3,000 delegates leaped to their feet and roared approval . The resolution charged that the steel industry was " on strike against the Government 's price regulations which apply to all other industries " and was seeking a " special Government license to gouge the consuming public . " Murray Sees A Mandate Mr. Murray said he considered the resolution a mandate to " wring " an agreement from the industry on the basis of the wage board 's recommendations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had participated in the argument before the Supreme Court yesterday on the President 's seizure of the steel mills , asked the delegates to vote on the industry 's offer of a 121/ , cent increase . A thunderous " No " was the convention 's reaction . In his talk to the convention , Vice President Barkley said the Government had not sought to give labor any special favor but had tried only to " see that every laboring man has justice and equality in the solution of his problems . " He asserted that the union 's " consideration for the interests of the American people " in voluntarily postponing strike action for 134 days stood out as " an example to all others in this fair land of ours . " Secretary Tobin derided the contention of the steel industry that it opposed the board 's proposal for a union shop on the grounds of principle . Mr. Tobin said the major steel companies already had union shop contracts covering coal miners and other classes of workers and that 45 per cent of all the companies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray union .
