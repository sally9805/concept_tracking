For six years Burma was so neutral that it would take foreign aid grants from no one . In a surprising policy switch last month , the Government decided to take aid neutrally from all corners-and started off with a four-year pledge of $37 million from the U.S. for road and school construction . Last week , presenting his new budget , Finance Minister Kyaw Nyein showed how well the new-style fiscal neutrality works . Among expected revenues : <P> From the U.S. ( first annual payment of ICA funds ) : $13,272,000 . <P> From the Soviet Union : $4,879,000 in credits . <P> From the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development : $5,733,000 . <P> From the Colombo Plan ( British-and Commonwealth-backed , though Burma as a matter of fact has quit the Commonwealth ) : $483,000.
