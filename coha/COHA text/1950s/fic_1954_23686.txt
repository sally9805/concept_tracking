The Ladies of the House 1 N ENGLAND I had a great friend called Jack Courtenay who was assistant manager in one of the local mills . The family was originally from Cork , but he had come to England when he was about eighteen and married an English girl called Sylvia , a schoolteacher . Sylvia was tall , thin , fair , and vivacious , and she and Jack got on very well together . They had two sons , seven and nine . Jack was big-built , handsome , and solemn-looking , with a gravity that enabled him to get away with a good deal of innocent practical joking . He was an athlete , with the athlete 's good nature when he was well , and the athlete 's hysteria when he was n't . Let Courtenay have a toothache or a cold in the head and he went stark , staring mad ; retired to bed ( except when he could create more inconvenience by not doing so ) and conducted guerrilla warfare against the whole household , particularly the children , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I must say that on such occasions Sylvia was a little too English for my taste . " Do stop that shouting ! " " Why do n't you see the dentist ? " and " Fiddlesticks " were remarks that caused me almost as much pain as they caused Jack . Fortunately , his ailments were neither serious nor protracted , and Sylvia did n't seem to mind so much about his other weakness , Copyright , 1954 , A . Story by Frank O'Connor which was girls . He had a really good eye for a girl , and a corresponding vanity about the ravages he could create in her heart , so he was forever involved with some absolutely stunning blonde . At Christmas my friendship usually involved me as well , and I was either dispatching or receiving parcels that Sylvia was n't supposed to know about . These flirtations ( they were n't any more than that ) never became really serious . The man was a born philanderer . He regarded me as a Puritan because I disliked his schoolboy jokes , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . Sylvia 's he had apparently broadened already . " Did you know Jack 's got a new girl , Phil ? " she asked me while he beamed proudly at us both . " Such a relief after the last one . He did n't show you that one 's photo ? Oh , my dear , the commonest-looking piece ! " " Now , now , who 's jealous ? " Jack would say severely , wagging his finger at her . " Really , Jack , " she would reply with bland tolerance , " I 'd have to have a very poor opinion of myself to be jealous of that . Did n't you say she was something in Woolworth 's ? " While I was there , the sister with whom Jack 's mother lived in Ireland died , and Sylvia , with characteristic generosity , invited the old woman to live with them . At the same time I do n't think she had any idea what she was letting herself in for . It was rather like inviting a phase of history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an excellent housekeeper , so there was at least one advantage about the arrangement , for it allowed Jack and Sylvia to get away together by Frank O'Connor occasionally . The children liked her and she spoiled them , but still her heart was not in them . They had grown up outside her scope and atmosphere . Her heart was all the time in the little house in Douglas Street in Cork , with the long garden and the apple trees , the old cronies who dropped infor a cup of tea and a game of cards , and the convent where she went to Mass and to visit the lifelong friend whom Sylvia persisted in calling Sister Mary Misery . Sister Mary was always in some trouble , and always inviting the prayers of friends , so the nickname stuck . J ACK stood in great awe of his mother , and this was something Sylvia found it difficult to understand . He did n't , for instance , like drinking spirits before her , and if people had to be entertained while she was there he drank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Wislia , do you know , I think I 'll go to my old doss . Good night to ye all . " It was only then he relaxed enough to start on whisky . Mrs. Cotirtenay was always up for early Mass , but this was practically her whole recreation , as her only company , apart from myself , was Father Whelan , the parish priest , a nice , simple poor man , but from Waterford ? " not at all the same thing " as Sylvia soon observed . For a Waterford man he did his best . He lent Mrs. Courtenay the papers from home ; sometimes a Cork Examiner but mostly religious papers , about Little Nellie of Holy God , the Miracles at Knock , and the Maynooth Mission to China . " Simple papers for simple people , " he explained to Sylvia , just to show he was n't taken in by them . But if he implied a criticism of Mrs. Courtenay , he underrated her capacity . " Has n't Father Tom a beautiful face , Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph of some mountainous clergyman . " You 'd never want to hear another Passion sermon after Father Tom . Poor Father Whelan does his best , but , of course , he has n't the intellect . " " How could he ? " Sylvia would say with a poker face . " We must remember he 's from Waterford . " Mrs. Courtenay never knew when Sylvia was pulling her leg : " Why then , indeed , Sylvia , " she said , giving her a reproving look over her spectacles , " some very nice people come from Waterford . " Sylvia simply did n't know what to make of her mother-in-law . At first she inclined to the belief that the old woman was slightly dotty , but Mrs. Courtenay 's ability as a housekeeper finally ruled that out . " We 're very busy these days , " she would sigh after Mrs. Courtenay had gone to bed , and she was enjoying what her husband called " the first pussful . " " We 're doing another novena for Sister Mary Misery 's sciatica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really , she talks as though God were a Corkman ! " " Well , " Jack said with a chuckle , " some very nice people came from Cork . " " But it 's fantastic , Jack , it 's simply fantastic ! " Sylvia cried , slamming her hand on the arm of her chair . " She 's upstairs now , talking to God as she talked to us . She feels she will wear Him down , exactly as she says . " " She probably will , " said I. " I should n't be in the least surprised , " Sylvia said . " She 's worn me down . " T HOUGH Mrs. Courtenay did not like to say it to Sylvia , who might have thought her prejudiced , she was shocked by the character of the English , who , from the age of fifteen or so , seemed to spend their lives falling in and out of love , bin , fortunately , a lot of this was concealed from her by her lack of familiarity with the details . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a son the age of Jack , tried to start a conversation with Mrs. Courtenay about the dangers young fellows had to endure .

" The one time I was there , the traffic nearly took the sight out of my eyes . " " And it 's not only the traffic , is it ? I mean , we send them away healthy , and we want them to come back healthy . " " Ali , indeed , " Mrs. Courtenay said triumphantly , " was n't it only the other day I was saying the same thing to you , Sylvia ? Whatever he gets there , Jack 's digestion is never the same .

N ATURALLY , Jack and Sylvia both me of the absolutely stunning nette he had met in Manchester , ing a Ministry car . Then , for some reason , the flow of confidences dried up . I knew better than to ask questions . I knew that Jack would tell me in his own good time . He did , too , in a country pub , one evening we were out walking . In a slightly superior way , with a smile that did n't seem quite genuine , he told me he was having trouble . " Serious ? " I asked . " Well , " he said with a shrug , " Margaret 's had a baby . " He expected me to be shocked , and I was , but not for the same reason that he expected . It was clear he was badly shaken , did n't know how his philandering had gone so far , and was blaming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck , " I said . " Not altogether luck , " he replied . " She wanted it . " " Oh ! " I said , beginning to realize the mess in which he had landed himself . You mean sh c ? ? " " Wants to keep it , yes , " he cut in . " Her parents would n't let her , so she 's left home . " " Oh , " I said again . " That is rotten . " " It 's not very pleasant , " he said , sciously trying to restore himself in role as man of the world by lowering of the conversation . " Does Sylvia know ? " " Good Lord , no , " he exclaimed , and this time it was he who was shocked . " There 's no point in upsetting Sylvia . " " Sylvia will be a damn sight more upset if she hears of it from someone else , " I said . . " Yes , " he replied after a moment . " I see your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not . He had the sort of sensitiveness which leads men into the most preposterous situations in the desire not to give pain to those they love . It never saves them pain in the long run , of course . I was all for giving the pain at once and getting it over . I should even have been ? prepared to break the news to Sylvia myself , to be sure she had someone to bawl on . Instead , when she talked to me about it some months later it was in her official tone . " Jack 's got himself into a scrape with the brunette , Phil , " she said lightly , affecting to he busy about the room . " Has he told you ? " I could have shaken her . ' There was no need to do the stiff upper lip on me . " He has , " I said . " How is she ? " " Baby 's ill , and she 's had to chuck her job . Jack 's really quite worried . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's he going to do ? " " What can he do ? " she exclaimed with a lift of her shoulders . " He should look after the girl . I 've told him I 'll divorce him . " " Is that what you want to do ? " " Well , my feelings do n't count for much in this . " " That 's scarcely how Jack looks at it . " " So he says , " SylVia muttered with a shrug . " Do n't be silly , Sylvia , " I said . She looked at me for a moment as though she might explode on me and I almost wished she would . " Oh , well , " she said at last , " if that 's how he feels he should bring her here . You ca n't even imagine what girls in that position have to go through . It 'll simply drive her to suicide if it goes on and then he will have something to worry about . He must do one thing or the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " B Y THIS time I was feeling quite sorry for Jack . It 's bad enough when girls start weeping on you , but intolerable when they keep a stiff upper lip . At  --  the same time , I loved her spirit . " What 's his objection ? " I asked . " Mother does n't know we drink , " said Sylvia maliciously . " Anyhow , as if it would ever cross her mind that he was responsible ! She probably thinks it 's something you catch - from leaning against a tree . " " I 'll talk to him , " I said . " Tell him Granny need never know , " she pleaded . " He does n't even have to pretend that he knows Margaret  --  she can be a friend of mine . And at a time like this who 's going to inquire about her husband ? We can kill him off in the most horrible Manner . The old hitch just loves tragedies . " . I found it difficult to talk to Jack . His mas-culine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at taking help from Sylvia .

" l 'm afraid what you suggest is impossible , " he said stiffly . " Well , " I asked , " what are you going to do ? " " Sylvia said she 'd divorce me , " he replied in a sulky voice that showed it would be a long time before Sylvia was forgiven for her high-minded offer . " Is that what you want ? " I asked . " But , my clear man , it 's not a question of what I want , " he scoffed . " You mean you wo n't accept Sylvia 's charity , is that it ? " " I wo n't go on my knees to anybody , for anything , " he replied hotly . " Do you want Sylvia to go on her knees to you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's how she feels about it ? " " You would n't like me to get a note from her ? " I asked . ( I knew it was malicious , but I could n't resist it. ) r WAS a wet evening , and the narrow sloping High Street with its rattling inn signs looked the last word in desolation . As I turned up the avenue to the Courtenays ' the wind was rising and tossing the trees . Far in the distance it had blown a great gap in the cloud through which a green light poured . Mrs. Courtenay opened the door for me . " They 're not back from the station yet , " she said . " Did you have your tea ? " " Yes , " I said . " All I want is to get warm . " " I suppose they 'll be having it when they come in , " she said . " ' The train must be late . " Just at that moment the taxi drove up , and Sylvia rushed a strange girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plump-faced , and dimpled , and had an extraordinary flow of conversation which seemed to be largely nervous . Jack came in carrying the basket and laid it on a chair in the hall . His mother went straight to it . " Wisha , is n't he lovely , God bless himl " she said , showing her gums , while her eyes lit up with pleasure ? .. . " I think I 'd better get him fed and settled down , " Margaret said nervously . " Yes , " Sylvia said . " Margaret and I will take him up to the bedroom . Will you pour her a drink first , Jack ? " " Certainly , " jack said , beginning to beam . " Nothing I like so much . Whisky , Mrs. Harding ? " " Oh , whisky  --  Mr. Courtenay , " she replied with a nervous laugh . " Wo n't you call me Jack ? " he said with a mock-languishing air . I think he was almost enjoying the mystification , which had something in common with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , her hands joined in her lap . " Is n't she young to be left a widow ? " she said over her shoulder to us . " God help us , the world is full of trouble . " Sylvia and Margaret came down , and I followed Sylvia into the kitchen to help with the tea . " Is n't she nice ? " she said enthusiastically . " Really , Jack has remarkably good taste . " At ten Mrs. Courtenay drew the shawl about her shoulders , said , " I 'll go to my old doss , " and went upstairs . Some time later , chatting over our drinks , we were interrupted by a sickly little whine . Margaret jumped up nervously . " That 's Teddy , " she said " I sha n't be a minute . " " I should n't trouble , dear , " Sylvia said blandly , and we heard a door open softly . " I rather thought Granny would come to the rescue , " she explained . " He may be afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened again . We heard the old woman 's voice , soft and almost continuous and the crying ceased . Apparently Teddy did n't regard Mrs. Courtenay as a stranger . In the silence we suddenly heard as if for the first time the billows of wind break over the house . N EXT morning , when Teddy had been settled in the garden in his pram , Mrs. Courtenay said , " I think I 'll take him for a little walk . They get very tired of the one place . " She knew things about babies that were n't in any textbook . She did n't appear again till lunchtime . She had taken him to the park ? " They 're very fond of trees . " The sad tale of his father 's death in an air crash in the Middle East had proved a safe intro-duction to the other women in the park , and Mrs. Courtenay , who usually complained that the English were very standoffish , returned in high good humor , full of gossip  --  the untold numbers blinded , drowned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young women who got too intimate with foreigners . The Poles in particular , were a great disappointment to her  --  such a grand Catholic nation , but so unreliable ! " I do n't know , " she sighed . " I think our own are the best , after all . " T HAT evening , when we heard the shriek from the bedroom , there was no ques- tion about who was to deal with it . Mrs. Courtenay pulled her shawl firmly about her and went upstairs . Margaret , a very modern young woman , had Teddy 's day worked out to a timetable , stipulating when he should be fed , lifted , and loved , but it had taken that baby no time at all to discover that Mrs. Courtenay read nothing but holy books , and believed that babies should be fed , lifted , and loved whenever it suited themselves . " I 'm sure it 's bad for him , Sylvia , " Margaret said , all on edge . " Oh , dreadful ! " Sylvia sighed heartlessly as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But Granny is thriving on it . Have n't you noticed ? " A curious situation was developing in the house which I watched with fascination . Sylvia began to grow very attached to Margaret , and Margaret , who had come expecting to have every possible humiliation inflicted on her , did n't quite know what to make of it and was attracted by Sylvia . It was jack who was odd man out . Their friendship was a constant puzzle to him . He knew what Sylvia thought of him as much as any man knows what his wife thinks of him , which is very little , and he knew what Margaret thought of him , or at least believed he did , but what the pair of them thought and said about him while they were together was something he could n't imagine , and judging by the frown which frequently drew down one side of his face , he felt it could n't be very nice . Sylvia was older , shrewder , more practical , and Margaret 's guilelessness took her breath away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she had fluttered round with some of the most inappropriate types imaginable and from these drew vast generalizations that included all races and all men , most of them uncomplimentary . Jack had been the first to wake her passions , and now she envisaged nothing but a life of self-dedication to the memory of a couple of weekends with him , and to the upbringing of his child . Sylvia realized that she needed an older woman to advise her . I do n't suppose she ever criticized Jack as Jack suspected he was being criticized ; Margaret would n't have stood for it , but she certainly tried to change the girl's. attitude to men and marriage . " She really is the sweetest girl , Phil , " she said enthusiastically to me , " but , oh , dear , she 's such an impossible romantic . What she needs is a husband . He 'll soon knock the romance out of her . " I had a shrewd idea that she regarded me as a likely candidate for the honor of knocking the romance out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl , I felt the situation was already complicated enough . 0 NE Saturday afternoon a really awkward ' thing happened . I had gone up early , after lunch , to take Jack for a walk . When I arrived , he was n't ready so I sat in the front room with Sylvia , Margaret , and Mrs. Courtenay . I got the impression that there were feelings , at least on the old lady 's part , and I was right . There were . It had taken Teddy a week to discover she had a bedroom of her own , but when he did he took full advantage of it . She had now become his devoted slave , and when we met I had to be careful . that she did n't suspect me of treating him with insufficient respect Two old women on the road had made a mortal enemy of her because of that . And it was n't only strangers ; even Margaret came in for criticism . The criticism this Saturday afternoon had been provoked first by Margaret 's inhuman refusal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and secondly , by the pointed way the two younger women went on with their talk instead of joining her in keeping him entertained . She could have grabbed me , of course , but it gave her more satisfaction to make their monstrous inhumanity obvious even to themselves . " Wisha , go on ! " she said modestly . " You 'll want to he talking . He 'll he getting his dinner soon anyway . The poor child is famished . " Except for a slight feeling of uneasiness , I got nothing of this , and joined the girls gladly enough , while Mrs. Courtenay , playing quietly with the baby , suffered in silence . Just then Jack came in . " Ali , here 's Daddy now ! " Mrs. Courtenay said triumphantly . " Daddy will play with us . " " Daddy will do nothing of the sort , " Jack retorted with great presence of mind . " Daddy wants somebody to play with him . Ready , Phil ? " B UT this did n't relax the tension in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and raised her shoulders . Meanwhile , Mrs. Courtenay , apparently quite unaware of the effect she had created , was making Teddy sit up and show off his tricks . Sylvia followed us to the door . " Does she suspect anything ? " she asked anxiously with one hand on the jamb . " Oh , not at all , " Jack said with a shocked expression . " That 's only her way of speaking . " " Hm , " Sylvia grunted . " Curious way of speaking . " " But really , Sylvia , " I said , " if she did suspect , that 's the last thing in the world she 'd have said . " " Like leaning against a ship , " Sylvia said dryly . " I dare say you 're right . " But she was n't certain . jack walked on down the avenue without speaking and I knew he was shaken too . " Awkward situation , " he said at last with a wry grin . Since Margaret 's arrival he had become what for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone to confide in . He could n't any longer confide either in Margaret or Sylvia because the confidences might be passed On . " I do n't think it meant what Sylvia imagines , " I said as we set off up the hill from the Main Street . " I dare say not , but still it 's very awkward ? two women in a house , " " I suppose so , " I said . " You know what I mean ? " I thought I did , and I liked his delicacy . Being a chap who never liked to hurt people 's feelings , he almost certainly had nothing to do with either of the girls . He would n't have thought it nice . Having had so much to do with both , and being the sort who is accustomed to having a lot to do with women , he probably found it a strain . They must have found it so likewise , because their behavior had grown decidedly obstreperous . They even made fun of him before me . The situation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said cautiously . I knew he wanted to talk . " Last night Sylvia woke me when the alert went , to go and keep Margaret company , " he went on in a tone in which pain , bewilderment , and amusement were about equally blended . It was as though he were fastidiously holding up something small , frail , and not quite clean for your inspection . She said she 'd go if I did n't . I 'd have preferred her to go , of course , and do you know what she said ? Margaret wo n't like it , and you 've shown her little enough consideration since she came . ' What do you make of that ? ' ' " Rather tactless of Sylvia , " I said . " I know , " he added with indignation and yet with a touch of amusement and wonder . " And it 's so unlike her . She said I did n't understand women . " " And did you go ? " " I had to , " he complained . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I had to stay with her just the same . " I could fill in the gaps in his narrative and appreciate his feelings . Obviously , before going to Margaret 's room he had to go to his mother 's to explain Sylvia 's anxiety for her old school friend , and having done all a gentleman could do to spare the feelings of three women , had gone back to bed with the feeling that they were all laughing at him . And though he told it lightly , I had the suspicion that he would never again be quite comfortable with either Sylvia or Margaret . " Now your days of philandering are over , " was running through my head . I was n't sure that he would be quite such a pleasant friend . ARGARET remained for some months until the baby was quite well and she had both got a job and found a home where Teddy would be looked after . She was full of gaiety and courage , but I had the feeling that her way was not an easy one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been knocked out of her . It was marked by the transference of her allegiance from Jack to Sylvia . And Sylvia was lonesome too . She kept pressing me to come to the house when Jack was away . She corresponded with Margaret and went to stay with her when she was in town . They were linked by something which excluded Jack . To each of them her moment of sacrifice had come , and each had risen to it , but nobody can live on that plane forever , and now there stretched before them the commonplace of life with no prospect that ever again would it call on them in the same way . Never again would Sylvia and Jack be able to joke about his philandering , and the house seemed the gloomier for it , as though it had lost a safety valve . Mrs. Courtenay too was lonely for Teddy , though with her usual stoicism she made light of it . " Wisha , you get very used to them , Phil , " she said to me as she pulled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no proper introduction when she went to the park , was jealous of the mothers and grandmothers who met there , and decided that the English were as queer and standoffish as she had always supposed them to be . For weeks she slept badly and talked with resignation of " being in the way " and " going to her long home . " She never asked about Teddy , always about his mother , and when Margaret , who seemed to have got over her dislike of the old woman , sent her a photo of the child , she put it away and did not refer to it again . 0 NE evening , while Sylvia was in the kitchen , Mrs. Courtenay startled me by a sudden question . " You never hear about Mrs. Harding ? " she asked . " I believe she 's all right . " I said . " Sylvia could tell you . She hears from her regularly . " " They do n't tell me , " she said resignedly , folding her arms and looking broodingly into the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever told her anything . " Wisha , Phil , " she added with a smile , " you do n't think she noticed me calling Jack his daddy ? " She turned a searching look on me . It was one of those occasions when whatever you say is bound to be wrong . " Who 's that , Mrs. Courtenay ? " " Sylvia . She did n't notice ? " " I would n't say so . Why ? " " It worries me , " she replied , looking into the fire again . " It could make mischief . " " I doubt it , " I saill do n't think Sylvia noticed anything . " " I hope not . I made a novena that she would n't . She 's a nice , simple poor girl . " " She 's one in a thousand , " I said . " Why then , indeed , Phil , there are n't many like her , " she agreed humbly . " I could have bitten my tongue out when I said it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw him in the hall . Did n't you ? " " Know what ? " I stammered , wondering if I looked as red as I felt . " That Jack was his daddy , " she said in a low voice . " Sure you must . " " Oh , yes , " I said . " He mentioned it . " " He did n't say anything to me , " she said , but without reproach . You could see she knew that Jack would have good reason for not telling her . " I suppose ' he thought I 'd tell Sylvia , but of course , I would n't dream of making mischief . And the two of them such great friends too  --  wisha , is n't life queer , Phil ? " 1 N THE kitchen Sylvia suddenly began to sing " Lill Marlene . " It was then the real poignancy of the situation struck me . I had seen it only as the tragedy of Jack and Sylvia and Margaret , but what was their loneliness to that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a foreign tongue ? Now I realized why she did not care to look at the photograph of Margaret 's son . " It might be God 's will her poor husband was killed , " Mrs. Courtenay said .

And the baby so lovely and all  --  oh , the dead image of Jack at his age ? " Sylvia accompanied me to the door as usual . Now when we kissed good night it was n't such an act on her part ; there was emotion in it , not because she cared any more for me but because she was already seeking for support in the world outside . The bubble in which she had lived was broken . I was tempted to tell her about her mother-in-law , but something held me back .
