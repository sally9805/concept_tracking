Hilda Crane ( by Samson Raphaelson ; produced by Arthur Schwartz ) is purely synthetic stuff , but it is chock-full of what a lot of people mean when they speak of a play . It dramatizes the problem of a woman-a woman twice married and divorced , passionate by nature , restless in spirit , divided in mind . In a chastened mood , she marries an admiring dullard she does n't love , embraces a provincial and domestic existence that can not last . The play possesses a full pack of such characters as the tough-minded mother ( Beulah Bondi ) and the son-worshiping mother-in-law ( Evelyn Varden ) . <P> Hilda Crane is such stuff as matinees are made of-one of those middle-class studies in scarlet chronicled from the first sleeping partner to the final sleeping pills . It expertly works the old Belasco formula of being realistic in all its details and stagy in all its essentials . Far from being convincing , it is not really specific : the characters are all preshrunk types colliding in pretested situations . But though often banal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly due to Jessica Tandy 's highly resourceful performance as Hilda , reminiscent though it is of her Blanche in A Streetcar Named Desire . She portrays a woman full of inner violence and contradictory cravings , with overnight-hotel-room emotions that can find no permanent home . If she can not really illuminate the part from within , outwardly she gives it an almost showy brilliance .
