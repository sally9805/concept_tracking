It was just 22 years since he took over as the Caudillo of Spain , and Francisco Franco , 65 , is not the sort to let an anniversary pass unnoticed . Last week , at the " suggestion " of the government , Madrid 's newspapers dutifully listed Franco 's accomplishments ( e.g. , no fewer than 16 towns now bear the name Franco ) . " The moral qualities of Francisco Franco as a ruler , " said Arriba , " are infinitely superior to those of Emperor Augustus , Charles V , and Napoleon . " Such men as Franco , concluded the Catholic Ya , " are the instruments of the highest designs of Providence . " The Monarchist A.B.C . recalled Vichy Marshal Petain 's remark that Generalissimo Franco 's " is the cleanest sword in Europe . " Only the Syndicalist paper Pueblo avoided sycophantic assent . Wrote Pueblo sharply : " We believe that rhetoric is indissolubly united to the decadence of Spain over the past centuries . " <P> Even those who did not like the dictator had to concede @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with German and Italian help ) . He kept out of World War II ( except to send his Blue Division to fight against Russia ) . And he had avoided the postwar debacle of his fellow fascist dictators . Though denounced by the U.N . in its early days , Spain is now a U.N . member . And largely because of letting the U.S. build vast air and naval bases in Spain , Franco has in recent years got more than $1 billion in U.S. aid . <P> Spain is still a dictatorship , but not so severely as it once was . It is more prosperous than it used to be-though still the poorest nation in Western Europe , outside its next-door neighbor Portugal , where a fellow dictator , Antonio de Oliveira Salazar , is Franco 's only senior in office .
