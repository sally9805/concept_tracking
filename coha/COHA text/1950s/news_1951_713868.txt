txt The White House announced today that President Truman had first considered removal of General of the Army Douglas last August when the general sent his letter discussing foreign policy in the Far East to the Veterans of Foreign Wars convention in Chicago . At that time Mr. Truman directed General to withdraw his statement , which he did , but not in time to prevent its publication . The President promptly issued a statement of his own , emphasizing that the United States had no designs itself on Formosa . The President decided then not to remove General but to attempt instead to reach an understanding with him so that he would refrain from controversial statements on military and foreign policy while continuing to command our troops in Korea and Japan . Joseph Short , White House press secretary , issued a statement today to clarify the President 's press conference remark of yesterday that he had been considering dismissal of Gen. off and on for about a year . Taken literally , the presidential // statement yesterday meant that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May , six weeks before the war began in Korea : Some persons , including General himself , construed it this way and raised the question of why , if this were true , the President subsequently named General as the supreme commander of the United Nations forces in Korea . When the question of General 's interpretation was raised at the White House this morning , Mr. Short first replied " no comment , " but reporters urged him to ask the President for a clarification . A couple of hours later Mr. Short called newsmen into his office and gave them this statement : " When the President said yesterday that this had been going on for about a year , he was thinking of the first time that he read the letter to the V. F. W. , which was in the month of August . " A reporter asked if the President had not considered General 's dismissal before the outbreak of the Korean war . " He had not , " Mr. Short replied . " He was just speaking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precise as to time . " There were no Senate committee hearings on the dismissal today , but controversy continued , with Republicans continuing to charge " whitewash " as a result of yesterday 's 18-to-8 vote upholding General of the Army Omar N. Bradley in his refusal to reveal confidential discussions between himself and the President . The issue over General Bradley , who is Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , brought a temporary halt Tuesday to his testimony before the Senate Armed Services and Foreign Relations committees . The 18-to-8 vote was by these committees . Senator Alexander Wiley , Wisconsin Republican and ranking minority member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , charged today that the majority membership of the committees had been " partisan in its frantic desire to cover up and whitewash . " In a letter to Senator Richard B. Russell , Georgia Democrat and chairman of the Armed Forces Committee , who has been presiding at the hearings , he urged that a renewed effort be made to persuade the President to permit revelation of what transpired at the April 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President told his press conference yesterday that such talks with his staff were his business and his alone . " I want to point out that the President has not stated that the disclosure of the facts as to his conversation , consultations and conferences  --  that such disclosures would be harmful to the public interest , " Senator Wiley declared . " He has simply stated an arbitrary edict that , whether his conversations affect the national security or not , they are nobody else 's business but his . " " Whitewash " and " Washout " Seen " I hesitate to conclude at this early stage , but I must say that from the way the joint hearings have proceeded thus far they may end up being considered not only a whitewash but a washout . " Before the White House made its announcement to clarify President Truman 's remarks Senator H. Styles Bridges , New Hampshire Republican and ranking minority member on the Armed Services Committee , issued a statement raising proposed new issues for investigation . He said that Mr. Truman 's press conference statement yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it disclosed for the first time that " there was a long standing difference of opinion between him and General . " Senator Bridges continued : " As a result , the committees must get answers to these ques-tions : " Why was General appointed by the President as Commander of United Nations forces if he was being considered for removal ? " Why did President Truman fly some 14,000 miles to Wake Island last October , just before elections , to confer with and pin a medal on him with public praise ? " Why have General Marshall and General Bradley indicated in their testimony that only recent moves led to the ouster ? " The hearings will resume Monday , with General Bradley continuing his interrupted testimony . The committee recessed for the balance of this week because all the members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were committed to make speeches in various parts of the country marking Armed Forces Day tomorrow . " No Comment " by General said yesterday that he had " no comment " on the White House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to think of removing him .
