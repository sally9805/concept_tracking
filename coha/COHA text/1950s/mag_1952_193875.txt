Another Middle East King lost his throne : 43-year-old Talal of Jordan , after a tragic eleven-month reign . Adored by his people , Talal fell victim not to a plot but to schizophrenia , which grew steadily worse despite treatment in Switzerland . This week Jordan 's Parliament sorrowfully deposed him . He is succeeded by his son , Crown Prince Hussein , a thin , introspective adolescent . Interesting coincidence : Hussein and his cousin , King Feisal of Iraq , studied at Harrow at the same time , will each rule a Hashemite kingdom at the same time , on reaching 18 , next May 2.
