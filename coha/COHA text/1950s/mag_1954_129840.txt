Decibels // While baseball 's flanneled warriors strove at the gates of Valhalla last week ( with Cleveland and Giant fans full of anticipatory delight , Yankee , Milwaukee and Brooklyn followers vocal with dogged , mathematical hope ) , new heroes emerged into the limelight on land and sea : // ? The most surprising , most dogged , most long-suffering was a demure 16-year-old Toronto high-school girl named Marilyn Bell who became the first human to swim the 32-mile width of Lake Ontario from Youngstown , N.Y . to the Canadian shore near her home city . Marilyn stayed at her grueling chore after Channel Swimmer Florence Chadwick gave up , fought winds and rough waves , was almost ? but not quite ? conquered by exhaustion half a dozen times before she reached the Toronto seawall ( see page 23 ) . // ? Eugene ( " Gene " ) Walet III of New Orleans , who startled the yachting world last year by winning the Mallory Cup in the North American Sailing Championship at the tender age of 18 , successfully defended his prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see page 47 ) . // ? The Kentucky-bred three-year-old Never Say Die brought tears of joy to the eyes of his owner ? 78-year-old New York Financier Robert Sterling Clark ? by winning England 's historic and testing St. Leger by 12 lengths ( see page 25 ) . // ? Meanwhile , the U.S. college football season began ? so quietly , so diffidently , so far out in the brakes and the bushes that hardly anyone noticed . Nevertheless there were scores : Wayne ( Neb. ) 13 , Augustana ( S.D. ) 7 ; Youngstown ( Ohio ) 13 , Gustavus Adolphus 0 ; Moorehead ( Minn. ) 7 , Huron ( S.D. ) 0 ; Concordia ( Minn. ) 12 , North Dakota State 0 ; Central Michigan 26 , Milwaukee State 7 ; Peru ( Neb. ) 14 , Panhandle A &amp; M ( Okla. ) 7. // Dressed to kill // Pepper Martin was in the news last week , a wire-service item from Norfolk , Va. , reporting that Pepper at the age of 50 had pinch-hit a double for his Portsmouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piedmont League . Pepper is , of course , the old Gas House Cardinal whose rambunctious , hell-for-leather , dirty-uniformed play excited major-league fans for 12 years . // About the same time another item arrived , this one reporting that at the International Softball League tournament in Selma , Calif. , the Dayton ( Ohio ) Nationals had been selected as the " best-dressed team " in the tournament . What with memories persisting of the hawk-nosed Martin belly-whopping into third , dust spurting up all around , the news from Selma seemed somehow depressing . // Glenn Scobey Warner // Big-Bodied Pop Warner entered college football as a player at Cornell in 1892 ? in the era , as he liked to describe it , of " tousled hair and overstuffed pants . " He was a dominant figure in the game for almost half a century . He burst into prominence as a coach at Carlisle 's Indian school ; with Jim Thorpe and other mighty redskins he made life miserable for Harvard , Princeton and Yale in the early years of the century . At Pittsburgh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a truly national sport , Warner reigned as a brooding colossus of strategy . He invented the single-wing and double-wing system of attack and brought them to their zenith of effectiveness ; in the late ' 20s and early ' 30s there were but two ways to play the game , the Warner way and the Rockne way and disciples of the two giants preached the rival gospels with missionary fervor from coast to coast . // The massive Warner reputation and the impressive Warner manner , however , hid a strain of roguishness , of gleeful opportunism ? which produced , among other stunts which pained early rules committees , the famed hidden-ball trick . It was this aspect of his character that many of his graying former players recalled last week after Warner died , victim of cancer at 83 , in Palo Alto Hospital . Hal McCreery , who was captain of Warner 's Stanford University team of 1927 , hesitated not a second in recalling his most vivid memory of the grand old man . It concerned Stanford 's game with the University of Washington , played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quagmire by rain ( abetted , Stanford always suspected , by judicious use of a fire hose ) . The Stanford attack depended on speed and the passing of Fullback Biff Hoffman , and bogged down horribly in the first half . // " Every time the halfbacks tried to run they fell on their faces , " McCreery said . " Biff , who had to grip the ball to throw it , might as well have been trying to grab a piece of quicksilver . At half time we were behind 7 to 0 . In the dressing room Pop went over to Biff and said , ' Show me how you grip the ball . ' Then he got a thumbtack and taped it to the inside of Biff 's index finger so the point just stuck out of the tape . That thumbtack did it . Biff , who could throw the ball farther than any man I ever knew , just rared back and dropped it in Dick Hyland 's arms twice in the second half and we won the game 14 to 7. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dallas last week ( for an exhibition game with the Cleveland Browns ? see page 28 ) , Detroit 's Doak Walker and Cloyce Box found time for practice and skull sessions only through careful budgeting of their time . Box , a onetime West Texas State hero , owns a Buick agency in Belton , Texas and an interest in the Johnson-Box Construction Company of Fort Worth . Walker , an old Southern Methodist star , owns the Doak Walker Sports Center , a retail store in Dallas . Together , the two own an interest in a 229-unit housing development near Killeen , Texas , are Texas associates in the whopping George A. Fuller Construction Co. , are state distributors of a plastic-bag firm and are involved in sundry oil deals and other distributorships. // Both hit Dallas ahead of their Detroit teammates so as to have time for one business meeting after another . Walker , in fact , hustled downtown on the afternoon of the game . " We 're supposed to eat at four and rest until the kickoff , " he said with a worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal appearance at 4:15 at E. M. Kahn &amp; Co. clothiers who handle Doak Walker " personally designed " slacks and I 've got a lot of calls to make . " // What about rumors that Doak will retire this year ? " He has to , " said Cloyce Box . " He ca n't get the time to play football any more . " // The man who came back // No matter what happens to the Yankees , there can be no denying that they enjoyed a splendid and bracing experience in their first game with Baltimore last week . They won . This was more difficult than it might sound . The lowly Orioles started Pitcher Bob Turley ( 11 wins , 15 losses ) , and Turley fanned 12 men ? a 1954 strike-out record against the Yanks . // But big , drawling Yankee left-hander Tommy Byrne ruined Turley 's act . He not only limited the Orioles to two runs but hit a triple in the third , drove in three runs with a double in the fourth and went the distance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astounding for Byrne ? known for both speed and wildness during his early years in the majors ? was shucked off by the Yankees back in 1951 and , by the law of averages , should never have been seen in a Yankee uniform again . // When the Yanks turned him loose he drifted from the desolate Browns through the White Sox to the Washington Senators . With a peculiar lack of feeling Washington 's Clark Griffith peddled him to Charleston ? one day before he would have become a major league " 10-year man " subject to the maximum player pension and the right of free agency before being shunted to the minors . Disenchanted , Byrne won only one game last season . // Seattle nonetheless picked him up in a winter trade . " We have a chance to get Tommy Byrne , " said Rainier Manager Jerry Priddy to Casey Stengel . " What do you think ? " // " Get him , " snapped Casey . " The fella 'll drive you crazy with walks , but pitch him reg'lar and he 'll pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we let him go . The fella 's still got an arm . " // Seattle did more . They treated Byrne well . He was given a percentage of his sale price and Seattle General Manager Dewey Soriano promised to make an all-out effort to get him his " one more day " in the big leagues . Seattle players were told : " If Tommy talks about being wild , change the subject . Tell him his control is good . Tell him the umpires are robbing him . " // Byrne responded by winning 20 games . Between pitching chores he played first base and in the outfield . He worked in relief . He coached first base . And he hit ? he whacked out seven home runs and piled up the team 's second-highest batting average , a respectable .295 . After each of his victories General Manager Soriano sent out 16 identical telegrams , addressed to each major league club , detailing his strike-outs vs. walks , his earned-run average and other milestones in his heartwarming comeback . After his 20th victory Soriano sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Weiss : " Byrne wins No. 20 . Struck out seven . Now has 199 strikeouts against only 18 walks . Byrne control amazing . " Two nights later in Portland Soriano and Manager Priddy called the pitcher to their hotel room . // " You 're going to get that extra day , Tommy , " said Priddy . " You 're going back up . " // Byrne rubbed his head . " If I stayed here I could pitch you into the first division , partner . " // " Tell him who , " said Priddy. // " The Yankees , Tommy , " said Soriano . " They want you right away . " // The husky , Maryland-born pitcher did not speak for a while . Then he said , " Say , now , that 's real nice . The Yankees . I did n't think they 'd ever want me back . " He grinned then and shook his head slowly . He looked at the telephone on its night stand . " Does anybody mind if I call my wife ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writes in about the first tournament of the European Baseball Federation , which he watched in Antwerp this summer : // To the American , European baseball is both a comedy of errors and touch-ingly idealistic . The players are eager and they try very hard , but they are lacking in the fundamentals . A few vital statistics will give Americans an idea of the stage of development . // Teams representing Italy , Spain , Belgium and Germany participated in this year 's four-game tournament . In the championship game , played before about 600 spectators , Italy took Spain 7-4 . According to the official box scores of the four games there were 70 errors and 55 hits . The longest hits were doubles and one or two were accidents . // The Italians were relatively impressive . Their pitchers struck out 25 , walked only six . Moreover , they definitely played to win . In all this they reflected the devoted coaching of an American named Horace J. McGarity , superintendent of the U.S. military cemetery at Nettuno. // Unfortunately the McGarity-Italian approach did not endear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , an Italian base-runner slid home and was tagged out ? but the catcher dropped the ball . When the umpire insisted that the Italian was out , McGarity walked out to protest ? and explain . The umpire ignored him , and McGarity got no sympathy from the crowd . " Playing to win ! " sneered a Belgian near me. // The two big problems of European baseball are those of umpiring and scoring . In Europe the umpire is more important than in America and only the manager or captain of a team may protest him . The umpires take their role with a sense of great importance and will not allow their dignity to be trod upon . After the tournament games , many crowded around the chief umpires and congratulated them on their work . Umpires must be trained . Courses are given for umpires in all the countries . In Belgium it lasts 16 weeks and sessions are held once a week . But despite the importance of the umpires , the fans sometimes insult them . When provoked beyond patience , Spaniards call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shout " Cuckold ! " // Baseball developed in Italy and Germany after the war . When the beachheads had been secured GIs wanted to play ball . The Italians learned some of the rules of the game , tried their hand at Softball and graduated to baseball . The Spaniards learned their baseball from the Puerto Ricans . The Belgians played baseball before the last war and one finds old ballplayers in Antwerp . ( The game was introduced by Japanese sailors who would play near the docks when their ships were in port . ) Most of the German players are teen-agers . At a banquet held after the final game they were cheered enthusiastically . This happened in Belgium ? a nation that , less than 10 years before , had still been occupied by the German army . // Baseball is completely amateur in Europe . American baseball language is used officially , and fans and players are beginning to use American baseball terms . The Germans call a double play " Eier mil Schinken " ( ham and eggs ) . It is a strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Italians talking of hits , outs , errors and double plays and to talk with them about Lou Gehrig , Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb . And to hear in old Europe the cry " Play ball ! " Regardless of how well or badly the game is played in Europe , our national game has now struck roots on the continent . // The gunmen // Diplomat or pole vaulter , it matters not ? turn a Russian loose in the Western world and before you can say Jack Rabbit he is collecting refrigerators , elevator shoes , ladies ' nylon underwear or hair oil , with the scuttling fervor of a field mouse in the chicken feed . Few , however , have been quite so carried away as the Russian athletes who invaded Turin the other day for the European Swimming Championships . A toy store , the United Press reports , was their undoing . Four Russkies invaded the place with an interpreter , demanding an explanation of the plastic water pistols in the window . The weapons were filled and squirted . The Russians watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed up to be armed . The next day they entered the stadium beaming , yanked their weapons out from under their sweat shirts and sprayed their Iron Curtain colleagues , rocking with helpless laughter . // From then on , every toy store in Turin was under siege . Hungarians bought water pistols . Czechs bought them . Poles bought them . Romanians bought them . Spectators at the meet were treated not only to championship swimming matches ( Hungary won ) , but to endless wild West duels as well . By the time the well-squirted Communists departed , the price of water pistols in Turin jumped from 150 lire to 250. // Skin diver // This was a man who had taken up skin diving in a small way , on weekends . // " It 's the coldest sport I 've ever known , " he said . " It 's incredible . I use a snorkel , a breathing tube , but I try not to stay under more than 15 minutes at a time . When I come up and pull myself on to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking . Lying there in the sun with the temperature in the 90s and I 'm shaking . I 've got a good layer of fat too . " // The question was put : Why ? Because , like Everest , it 's there ? He laughed . " No , " he said . " It 's a challenge , but not like Everest , not like skiing . It 's strange . It 's the awkwardest damn thing to get into . You have on these flippers . Sometime try to walk with flippers . You feel like a fool . You go out , say , when the tide is out , and there 's all this flat , black muck , just stinking . Dirty shells all around and slimy rocks and seaweed . Awful . You ca n't dive into the water , because of the face mask and you ca n't find a rock and push off because of barnacles . // " It 's the awkwardest thing . It 's hot and glaring and you feel foolish . You work your way far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the water . And just like that , it 's all changed . It 's like a cathedral , all soft , diffused light and the sun touching the surface of the water above you . The muck on the rocks is like velvet and the seaweed is floating , each piece standing up by itself and waving slowly back and forth . // " It 's quiet , but it 's not deathly quiet . You can hear things . You can hear a lot of things under water . Motors , metal on metal , things like that . But it 's different . It 's soft and it 's peaceful . You 're suspended sort of weightless , and you move almost without effort , like in slow motion . The most completely relaxing thing I know . // " Cold , " he said , " but wonderful . " // WOMEN HAVE NO PLACE IN A BULL RING // Novillera Patricia McCormick , who has fought 80 bulls and proved her courage every time , was knocked down by one at Villa Acu ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and through the bladder . It was her third goring since she began practicing secretly for the bull ring while an art student at Texas Western College . She is 24 and very pretty . // In sports which involve the killing of animals the objective is to kill clean and quick . If a display of courage is involved at all , as in the killing of dangerous animals , it is only incidental to the real objective . For it is form which makes such things sport ? form in the killing of a trout with a dry fly , or shooting birds on the wing , or taking a lion with a well-placed shot from a rifle of sufficient caliber to do the job well . It is not sport to use inferior weapons which are likely only to wound . // On this subject , with which he is very familiar , Ernest Hemingway has made some observations in Death in the Afternoon . They seem apropos as Patricia McCormick lies under opiates in a Texas hospital , where in semicoma she told her mother that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the old days , Hemingway says , the bulls were bigger , fiercer , older , less easily controlled . The matadors , in turn , were mature men of long apprenticeship who knew how to make the final sword thrust without butchery . But in time the bulls were bred smaller , put into the ring younger and what showmen know as hokum was introduced in cape work . // " It is the decadence of the modern bull that has made modern bullfighting possible , " says Hemingway . " It is a decadent art in every way and like most decadent things it reaches its fullest flower at its rottenest point , which is the present . " // The present seems not to have changed much for the better since Hemingway put out his book in 1932 . As wrestling decayed in the same period , bouts between women wrestlers became more frequent , and as bullfighting decayed , more and more women were putting on the tight pants of the matador and treating the crowds to spectacles rather than sport . // At week 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
