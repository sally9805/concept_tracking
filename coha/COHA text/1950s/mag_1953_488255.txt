THROUGH the ages , women 's lives have centered about their sex role . Little , girls have been told as soon as they could toddle that some day they will be brides , and a little later , mothers , and , finally , if they live , grandmothers . Every other activity  --  learning to spin and weave , cook and bake , dance , sing , and skate , whatever the current accomplishments of young girls are  --  has been directed at achieving a lifelong career as wife and mother . Where for men actual sex activity , however insistently it may intrude upon attention , is a matter of a few minutes , for women each of these few minutes is laden with commitment before and commitment afterward . But men and women are also human ' beings , and although their sexual equipment and roles are so different , in many other respects they are extraordinarily similar  --  differences may go across sex lines , as artistic gifts , executive ability , body skills are found in each sex . In both sexes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsiveness and apathetic indifference to other people . As long as human beings have been elaborating their lives ? building houses that were more than shelters , conducting courtships that were more than a prelude to an im-mediate sex satisfaction , composing music , inventing new ways of producing and preparing food , developing ways of worshiping God and political systems that bound them to one- another  --  the question of how much and how little men and women are to-share equally in these discoveries and - inventions has been an important one . How much of the economic load of fishing and hoeing , carrying and marketing , how- much of the personal load of sexual pursuit and courtship , how much of the religious load of prayer and sacrifice , was to be put on women , how much on men ? With the change in woman 's economic position that came with her frontier role in the United States , and in the Western world with freedom to work outside the home , there-has come within our own history a change in the expectation of what a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls and boys are educated alike and taught to be individualistic , assertive , active , eager to make something of themselves . Boys learn to dislike girls who are " silly " and unlike themselves , and the - term " sissy " is applied to girls as well as to boys . We have developed as our ideal of human sex relationships one between a girl and a boy of almost the same age , with the same education and the same interests : if he skis , she should ski ; if he likes sailing , she sails . The NATION With this demand that the perfect girl should also be a perfect companion , have come early dating , a preference among boys for the company of girls far earlier than iseusual in most other countries of the Western world , a picture of marriage as a relationship in which one does what one wants to do together with the other . The boy wants the girl to be independent , to have something to say for herself , to be able to make her own living whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when there is a pinch , or after the children are grown , to keep her from wearing him out because she herself is bored . As he expects to stand on his own feet , to get along by his own efforts , after his parents have given him an education , so he wants a wife who can do the same thing THE SHIFT in styles of marriage away from the European pattern of the much younger wife , chosen in consultation with relatives for her suitability for a homebound role in which the experienced husband initiates his wife into sex , has been going on for a long time in America . Where the tendency in Europe is to emphasize man 's ungovernable impulses , in the United States it is feared that men will not be assertive enough . Where the emphasis in Europe is upOn man 's skill as a lover in playing on woman , who is pictured as a delicate responsive instrument , in the United States positive sex response has come to be regarded as something women ought to have , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to say no , to postpone , delay , repulse without offending , during the long years of dating . The whole pattern places heavy demands upon both men and women , not the least of which lies in the contrast between the role of play without completion , appropriate for dating , and the shift to complete sex satisfaction in marriage . As experiencing a positive sex climax is probably no more ' congenial to the whole female sex than was the passive , unemotional role demanded of their great-grandmothers , these demands force some women to learn to simulate , as they have always had to simulate through the ages , in order to conform to the current style in sex behavior . But - meanwhile , as the shades of Vic-torian taboo and restriction on speech October 31 , 1953 and knowledge have cleared away , a new approach to sex has become possible As young people learn how very differently sexed human beings are , how different their timing , their intensity , each couple may begin to explore and test their own innate rhythms . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compatibility is at least in part something that can not be produced at will , that may not be present even with every other sort of congeniality and suitability between young people . It leads to willingness to study each other 's moods , to pay positive attention to sex in-a type of marriage within which sex is regarded , as an important but not as the only essential component . Other things have happened too , as the American girl has learned to stand on her own feet , to drive a car , to earn her living like the American boy . Twenty-five years ago it looked as if this tendency to make Women independent might inaugurate a trend away from marriage , in which women , independent and unwilling to accept the drudgery of a home , would take lovers but refuse the continuous responsibility of husband and children . But quite the reverse has been the case. , As women were given a chance to move about freely , to set up for themselves , they have more definitely and actively chosen marriage and children . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more intolerant of an unsatisfactory marriage , but not less desirous of marriage . Girls have become more like boys ; both " do things , " and their goals as human beings have steadily approached each other . The male who sought and the female who waited to be sought , the male who achieved and the female who waited to be courted , the male who was actively sexed and the female who was passive and uninterested  --  these old models have gone out of style . Instead , we have boys and girls both of whom want to get married , both of whom want children , both of whom regard caring for little children as interesting , both of whom regard marriage as something to be workedat , something worth keeping . SINCE WORLD WAR II a new kind of marriage has developed in America , a marriage with greater frankness , greater articulateness , greater sharing than any we have known before in this country Lo an early marriage , focused on having children in comradeship . Women , frightened by the possibility that a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in active pursuit of mates . Men , weighed down by the uncertainties of the cold war and the heavy income taxes , have relinquished the task of preparing for a secure old age for that of giving the ' five a.m. bottle and taking the children to the beach . The principal threat to the success of such a marriage comes from the timing . Girls who marry at twenty-one , even if they have four children , may expect to have the children fairly well off their hands by forty , to be grandmothers at fifty . And then come the next twenty-five years , the years which hang like a cloud over the mother who sees her children taking advantage of the , independence which she has so sedulously cultivated . Two people who built their whole relationship on a cheerful , frank partnership in rearing children , and enjoying mountain-climbing picnics , now face each other for the first time in all these years across a dining-room table , alone , Here the , lack of complexity in their relationship , the lack of erotic sophistication in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife show " normal sex feeling " for any demand on himself for elaboration of love-making manners , begin to show . The male technique which depends on zest and urgency rather than ' upon sophistication and attentiveness is likely to flag altogether , or to cause him to turn to younger women who show him , as in a mirror , the lost spring-like vigor of youth . Women who have learned , to combine sex and motherhood with an ego-driven search for success are restless and discontented , feel unwanted and rudderless . So it seems at present that the most serious challenge to our mid-twentieth- century style- of marriage , with all its gaiety , its gallantry , its comradeship , he s in this last third of life . As a people we have always moved on to new things ; we have had little practice in enjoying a circle that turns hack upon itself . One way of resolving this difficulty in the middle age of Marriage , a difficUlty the anticipation of which throws a shadow over the gayest young marriage , is the historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , a new community for the wife , new friends in a new , landscape . This is perhaps the easiest , and the husbandly kiss and the wifely response may be activated in the new home , where magnolias - replace maples and dogwood . Another solution is the conscious cultivation of the more complicated pleasures  --  whether of cook- ing , gardening , collecting  --  of middle age , introducing a little of the minuet into the athletic tempo of the mambo , the good-humored , unelaborated , brisk relationships normal in early adulthood . Another solution , but a solution that to some degree solves a sex problem by dodging it , is for women to prepare for More definite work after their children are grown , so that for them , as for their husbands , home and sex become only a minor part of life , not the whole of it . This is perhaps the surest way of preventing women from becoming unbearably demanding as wives , asking for a kind of romantic satisfaction which Men do not know how to give . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but especially for the woman , to individualize their marriage , to think more about each other 's rhythms , each other 's capacities - for change and fulfilment . The kind of sex literature which merely gives statistics on frequency of sex relationships ' and reported types of satisfaction , so that a man or woman can compare his or her record with some national norm , is the least fitted to inform . Rather women  --  and men  --  need to know how infinitely varied the sex capacities of human beings are , how complex the patterns which release emotion , how various and wonderful the ways that lead to ecstasy . As they come to realize the extent and , depth of sex feeling  --  in the feelings of the young child and the parent , in the young lover who lives on in the middle-aged , and the vision of old age which makes the kisses given by the young already falter in uncertainty  --  the place of sex in the world , the importance of understanding sex , should take on a new dimension .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
