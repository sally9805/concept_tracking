The New York Times , which has no trouble printing " All the News That 's Fit to Print , " had considerable trouble last week deciding what nudes are fit to print . When the producers of the Broadway comedy , Reclining Figure , tried to place an ad in the Times illustrated with a line drawing of a reclining nude , a staffer in the ad department said no . Other New York dailies ran the ad as submitted , but in the Times the nude was decorously fitted with a brassiere . At week 's end , after taking the matter " under review , " the Times allowed the ad to run as originally submitted , apparently under a new rule of fitness , which could be paraphrased roughly as " All the Nudes that Fit the News . "
