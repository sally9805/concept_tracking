I had to postpone by at least 24 hours the most formidable array of fighting ships and of fighting men that was ever launched across the sea against a hostile shore . . . This is what I found out about religion : it gives you courage to make the decisions you must make in a crisis , and then the confidence to leave the result to higher power .

It is our protection against the moral confusion , which is too often the moral nihilism , of this age . The blight of moral relativism has not fallen destructively upon us ... The mass of our people expect of their public servants probity and decisive distinction between right and wrong in the discharge of their public responsibilities . <P> " The burdens attached to the office of President of the United States are enormous . I know that those responsibilites are so far beyond the limits of human wisdom and strength that , if I am called upon to bear them , I should be utterly dependent on the sustaining power of God as the source of truth and of wisdom in the endless hours of uncertainty and anxiety .
