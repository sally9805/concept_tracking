At many a sun-drenched trading post around Arizona and New Mexico 's 16 million-acre Navajo Reservation , Indians were trooping in last week to buy such sweets as canned peaches or candy . To the experienced trader , these innocent purchases meant only one thing : a peyote party was in the making . Soon , at some secret hideaway far out in the desert , men , women &; children would be enjoying the transitory delights of a powerful drug . After the party they would have a dismal hangover . The sweets were to help straighten them out . <P> Peyote is the fruit of the mescal cactus ( Lophophora williamsii ) , which grows abundantly in Mexico and in parts of Texas . Dried , the fruits look like buttons of half-dollar size , brown with a pale center . For 15 years the peyote habit has spread . Alarmed as early as 1940 , the Navajo Tribal Council outlawed peyote , but the ban could not be enforced . The peyote button had been adopted as a Communion host by the Native American Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " religious freedom " issue , refused to interfere . <P> Easy Prey . The Navajos , already wretched in their poverty and disease ( TIME , Nov. 3 , 1947 ) , were easy prey for peyote peddlers . The stuff offered them escape from their troubles . After a twinge of nausea ( felt only by beginners ) , the peyote-chewer gets an otherworldly sensation of being in two parts . Then come visions and hallucinations , always involving bright colors and lights- " dreams in Technicolor . " The medical aftereffects , still in dispute , apparently include impairment of the heart and kidneys . <P> One " peyote hassle " has been described by a paleface intruder . Navajos of all ages and both sexes sat around a fire with a crude sand-painting of the moon beside it . While the " peyote priest " fussed with the sand-painting , a tin tub full of water was boiling . Peyote buttons were dumped into it . After they had softened , they were fished out and passed around to be chewed . The liquid was doled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was " every man for himself . " Men hopped up with peyote , he reported , " are likely to grab the closest female , whatever age , kinfolk or not . " <P> Plentiful Supply . There have been many reports of sex crimes , some against children , committed under the influence of peyote . Last week Dr. Clarence G. Salsbury , longtime medical missionary among the Navajos ( and longtime foe of the Indian Bureau ) , reported that he had just heard of two cases of infanticide and one of fatal child neglect caused by peyote . At Flagstaff 's Navajo Ordnance Depot many Indians were unable to work for days at a time after peyote jags . At least one-third of the 61,000 Navajos are estimated to be addicts . <P> Peyote is not on the federal list of narcotics ( neither was marijuana until it became dangerously popular ) and is under no federal control . Some states , notably Texas , have tried to curb the peyote traffic , but Mexico has a plentiful supply . In Washington the Bureau of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies into the physical and social effects of peyote . Until proof to the contrary is received , the bureau is committed to the view that peyote is harmless . The men on the spot in the desert think they know better .
