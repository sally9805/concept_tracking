THE BLACK OBELISK ( 434 pp. ) - Erich Maria Remarque - Harcourt , Brace ( $4.50 ) . <P> <P> " I am no longer German . " said Novelist Erich Maria ( All Quiet on the Western Front ) Remarque twelve years ago . " Even when I dream , it is about America . " Remarque , now a U.S. citizen , may have American dreams , but his memories are still German . After several books on the Nazi-World War II era , he has now returned to the scene of his earlier . post-Versailles trips among the ruins ( The Road Back , Three Comrades ) . The quality of the new book and of its time is simply - almost too simply-defined by its central situation : the hero works for a tombstone firm , and the girl he loves is a schizophrenic at the local insane asylum . <P> Germany , in 1923 , is in the grip of dizzy inflation , so Ludwig plays the organ for church services at the asylum for a good Sunday dinner and yearns for enough billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother was constantly ill , the girls at a local brothel had seen to it that he did his schoolwork . At 18 , when he was about to be shipped off to the trenches , he presented himself as a customer , and the sentimental , motherly prostitutes packed him off to the front a virgin . He is welcome now , but he seldom has the price . <P> Author Remarque admits that he had to invent little of his story because so much of it happened to him . Hero Ludwig 's town of Werdenbrk is like Remarque 's Osnabrck in Lower Saxony . Remarque too wanted to be a poet and pianist and wound up with a tombstone firm ; he too recited his lessons to prostitutes . These hard times remembered in tranquillity result in a strange sort of book . The atmosphere is as febrile as a manic ward on the upbeat . The poor and aged commit suicide every day , but the tombstone firm does not prosper because the monuments are worth more than they are sold for . The characters in Obelisk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be living off the top of his head . Ludwig divides his time between beautiful Genevive at the insane asylum and a levelheaded , strong-bodied girl acrobat who wants a man able to buy some groceries . In the end , he loses both . <P> Amidst starvation life persists . Lovers keep dates among the gravestones , old drunkards find their schnapps no matter what , the butcher 's wife makes hay with Ludwig 's boss , and already a man named <P> Hitler has begun to shout in beer gardens . The book has many moments of Rabelaisian vulgarity , including a hilarious bordello scene , but they seem deliberately injected for shock value . As for the symbolism and the irony ( though Remarque says no symbolism was intended ) , they could scarcely be more obvious-the most valuable stone , a black obelisk , winds up as the marker over a prostitute 's grave , and in a post-World War II epilogue , only the madhouse and the maternity hospital are left undamaged . Remarque has long ago mastered a direct , insistent style that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mesmerized by the sententious cliche . There is much in this book that is funny , rueful and sorrowfully true . But he has drained just about all there is from German disillusion .
