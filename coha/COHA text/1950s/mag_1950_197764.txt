" Here , " beamed moonfaced Conductor Fritz Busch , " is everything so perfect . . . If we miss a note now &; then , is that so important ? What counts is the enthusiasm . " At Cincinnati 's 38th biennial May Music Festival , famed Metropolitan Opera Conductor Fritz Busch was getting just about all the enthusiasm he could handle , and he enjoyed every decibel of it . <P> For some of the festival 's choral numbers , he had assembled 1,800 singers , including some 600 children . Once the enthusiasm had to be coaxed out of the kids . Rehearsing Benjamin Britten 's Spring Symphony , Busch urged the boys to make their whistling less " polite " ; he promptly got a resounding wolf whistle , and smiled his appreciation . Said he : " They know their stuff . I bring it out of them . " <P> As they have since the 1870s , music-loving Cincinnatians packed the flower-banked Music Hall ( capacity 3,500 ) to hear and applaud everything . They got no beer &; pretzels program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he offered them dumpling-heavy portions of the music he loves best : Bach , Bruckner , Mahler Mozart , Verdi ( the Requiem ) , Wagner . On the last night , the audience in the Music Hall stood up to close the festival by roaring out the " Hallelujah Chorus " from Handel 's Messiah . <P> Said 60-year-old Fritz Busch , who had rehearsed his singers and players within an inch of their lives , " Yah , it 's lots of work . But it 's marvelous . " One thing that delighted him was the fact that " this year we had 13 soloists and nine of them are American-trained . That could n't have happened 25 years ago . It shows what festivals like this are doing . " <P> Even more heart-warming to Conductor Busch , who 17 years ago took a stand against Hitler and consequently lost his job at the Dresden Opera , was the fact that in Cincinnati he found " community expression in the best sense of the word . Boys &; girls , old ones and young ones , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't bother about the races . Yah , " says Fritz Busch , " it is great . "
