( See Cover ) In 1946 , Dr. Hans Thirring , a Viennese scholar without access to secret information , read certain published reports that could be found in any physics library . Going about the scientist 's business of mating known facts to breed new facts , Dr. Thirring made and published calculations leading to the conclusion that out of lithium hydride could be constructed a bomb many times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima . At the end of his austere equations , Dr. Thirring 's scientific article flamed up into a prayer : " God protect the country over which a six-ton bomb of lithium hydride will ever explode . " <P> Last week the U.S. learned some details of lithium hydride ( or equivalent ) explosions that had been set off-by the Russians and by the Americans . It learned that the force and horror of atomic weapons had entered a new dimension . It saw by television that the first full-dress H-blast ( Operation Ivy ) had turned the mid-Pacific sandspit named Elugelab into a submarine crater . While the shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present in the communication of the news , the U.S. was given-and received-the information as calmly as it might hear of any other scientific discovery . <P> President Eisenhower at his weekly press conference called upon a calm-voiced guest to give the news , and Lewis L. Strauss , chairman of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission , made his report sound as matter-of-fact as the minutes of a previous meeting . Yet there was no headline big enough to measure the implications of what Strauss had to say . <P> In a nine-minute prepared statement , Strauss noted that " there is good reason to believe " that the Russians had gone to work on a thermonuclear bomb " substantially before we did . . . We now fully know we possess no monopoly of capability in this awesome field . " The current series of U.S. H-bomb tests had thus far been successful " and enormous potential has been added to our military posture . " As to the reports that the March 1 blast ( TIME . March 22 ) had got out of hand , no such thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calculated estimate-a margin of error not incompatible with a totally new weapon . " <P> Educated Guesses . A few moments after Strauss had finished his statement , he got into a question &; answer exchange with reporters-an exchange memorable for its substance and for its tone of understatement . <P> A Reporter : Many people in Congress , I think many elsewhere , have been reaching out and grasping for some information as to what happens when the H-bomb goes off ... <P> Strauss : Well , the nature of an H-bomb is that , in effect , it can be made to be as large as you wish , as large as the military requirement demands , that is to say , an H-bomb can be made as-large enough to take out a city . <P> Chorus : What ? <P> Strauss : To take out a city , to destroy a city . <P> A Reporter : How big a city ? <P> Strauss : Any city . <P> Reporter : Any city ? New York ? <P> Strauss : The metropolitan area , yes i.e. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
