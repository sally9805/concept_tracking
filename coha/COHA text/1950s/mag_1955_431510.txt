T 8:59 on the evening of Saturday , April 24 , 1943 , residents of the New York metropolitan area : heard radio programs interrupted by this emergency flash : A large vessel containing explosives is afire off Bayonne . Open your windows slightly ; then keep away from them . This announcement is by authority of Louis L. Costuma , Acting Commissioner , New York Police Department . This was the first warning the world 's largest city had concerning its moment of greatest peril . ( Except for an " all-clear " it was also the last , because of wartime-security regulations . ) The vessel on fire was the 11,500-ton , 325-foot ammunition-carrier El Estero . She had been loading at the Caven Point dock in Bayonne ,  | N. J. , largest explosives-loading area in the East . For two days stevedores had beer stowing away four million pound : of antiaircraft ammunition , incen diary bombs , depth charges an ( half-ton blockbusters as well as hun dreds of cases of small-arms am munition and scores of drums o : high-octane aviation gasoline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulminate detonators , used to set off dynamite charges . Alongside El Estero were several lighters full of bombs and depth charges . Two other ammunition ships ? each flying the red Baker flag as a sign they were " hot , " and each loaded about as lethally as was El Estero ? were berthed only a short distance away . On the dock itself , within a few hundred yards , were railroad cars containing additional thousands of tons of high explosives . Elaborate safety precautions were in effect . No one was allowed to carry matches or cigarette lighters . Everyone was double-searched . An exposed nail in a shoe heel would keep the wearer out of the hazard area . The loading had been nearly completed when El Estero became a flaming inferno which for three hours threatened to blow parts of Manhattan , Brooklyn , Jersey City , Bayonne and Staten Island right off the map . At 5:40 p.m. , crewmen in the engine room of the ammunition ship saw a flash of fire . Oil on the bilge water beneath the engine-room gratings had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men grabbed hand extinguishers but the heat was too much to face . They were driven up on deck , as the ship 's passageways filled with blinding , choking smoke . The smoke was spotted by Coast Guardsmen on the pier , and within 15 seconds Commander J. T. Stanley ordered a specially trained crew of blaze battlers into action . Jersey City Fire Department apparatus shrieked toward Caven Point . At the Battery , New York 's biggest fireboat , the Fire Fighter , had cast off in less than a minute . Before it reached the fire scene , it was joined by another fireboat and a tender . Two tugs were standing by at the pier to shepherd El Estero , when loaded , to a deep-water anchorage . Suddenly the captain of one saw smoke pluming up from the big ship . He short-waved two sister tugs to come in and help with the terrifying task of getting the burning vessel away from the pier . It was clear to the Coast Guard contingent that if the flames licking at the cargo bulkheads down deep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high explosives , the resulting concussion would detonate other thousands of tons on the pier . That would start a chain reaction that would threaten every ammunition ship moving in the upper harbor or tied up at the huge Manhattan , Brooklyn , Hoboken and Jersey City piers . The force of the explosions would rupture the Bayonne  | and Staten Island storage tanks containing millions of gallons of gasoline . There would be hell on earth . The men who faced this peril had no time for contemplation . The flaming orange coming up through the hatches and the awesome clouds of black smoke pouring out of the holds indicated a running fire in oil or gasoline . This is the most difficult of all blazes to put out on shipboard . The sheets of flame roaring up through ventilators were generating heat so intense that shoe soles of the Coast Guardsmen working from the dockside were scorched . Yet by six o'clock , 20 minutes after that frightening flashback in the boiler room , the four tug captains and their crews somehow managed to make fast a steel towing-hawser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tugs got a strain on the hawser . The others made fast to different parts of the ship . The plan was to tow the doomed vessel downstream toward a deep spot in the upper harbor . It took nerve to do this , but not one of the hundreds of men on the boats or on the dock failed to stick to his job . In an attempt to stall off the terrific concussion long enough to save the ammunition pier from becoming the second link in the chain reaction , the fireboats tried desperate measures . Since their water streams could n't reach the fire in the boiler and engine rooms , their only hope was to pour enough water into the holds to sink the ship . But before that could be done the hundreds of drums of high-octane gasoline on deck would be sure to expand from the intense heat and burst . So , as El Estero began to move away from the pier , the concentrated force of six huge jets of water swept the 4o-gallon drums of gasoline off the deck of the ammunition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They smashed rails and bulwarks as they went , ripped loose winches and deck gear . Some of them burst as they hit the water , and the vapor was instantly ignited by the flames from the hatches . Tugs , fireboats and the Coast Guard launches maneuvered in a sea of liquid fire to get the ship headed downstream . Once the most flammable part of the deckload had been jettisoned , the fireboats turned their streams on the holds where the greatest concentration of explosives was stowed . It was 6:3o , nearly an hour after the first flash of blaze , before the weird procession began to buck the incoming tide down the harbor . First , two tugs in tandem on the bow hawser . Then , on either side of the burning ship 's forequarters , Coast Guard fireboats playing streams into the number one and two hatches . Next , amidships , the two huge fireboats hurling their mighty streams into hatches four and five . Finally , two more tugs butting their collision mats against El Estero 's stern , pushing . Navy launches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft . It seemed incredible that the ship had not blown up . Each ticking second increased the probability that  | the flames would heat steel bulkheads to the buckling point , letting hell loose . For 90 minutes it was race between fire and water . Grizzled veterans on the fireboats stuck to their posts , the while muttering Hail Marys . At eight o'clock the flotilla reached the shallows . As El Estero rolled sluggishly with the water in her holds , the fire burned more fiercely than ever . The fuel tanks had burst and were blazing . A muffled explosion sent a column of fire higher than the cargo masts . A staccato of smaller explosions made small puffs of smoke like the bursts from a mortar barrage . The fire was gaining , even as the tons of water hurled aboard began to make the ship ride lower . At this point the final blowup was judged to be so close that Admiral Stanley V. Parker , district Coast Guard officer , ordered the radio warning broadcast to surrounding residents . Long before this , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and firemen had been recalled . Air-raid wardens had been notified ; hospitals and first-aid groups mobilized . Nerves were taut in Bayonne , where ambulances were waiting with motors running . Anxiety had been mounting on nearby Staten Island for nearly three hours . " The suspense in firehouses and police stations ringing the harbor was beg coming unbearable . Then a cry went up from one of d the tugs : " She 's listing ! " The starboard rail sagged as if the battered ship were weary of the struggle . Men on the fireboats permitted mitted themselves the first faint d hope . The big streams poured on r without letup . The ship died hard , unwilling to go . But at five minutes past nine she rolled onto her side with an immense sighing of steam . A final dull rumble emerged from her hatches , followed by a great yellowish-gray cauliflower of smoke . She came to rest on the bottom with her starboard rail awash . It was quarter past nine . In the light of burning waves of oil , exhausted men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Easter parade next morning knew what had happened out there in the darkness of the harbor . Not until two years later , when security measures were slackened , were the men who saved the city given recognition for facing almost certain death . Two hundred and twenty-six officers and men from the tugboats , the New York Fire Department and the Coast Guard received medals for what , in a monumental understatement , was termed their " disregard of personal safety .
