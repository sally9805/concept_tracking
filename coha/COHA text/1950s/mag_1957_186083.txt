To the millions who surged westward to Los Angeles County after World War II , and to the millions who grew up and proliferated there , the California Way of Life was based on two prime elements : a house of their own and a car ( or two ) . To keep pace with the dream , the new houses spread tract by tract , town by new town across the once-shunned dry riverbeds , up the hillsides , into the canyons and even along the fringes of the forbidding brown mountains . One of the farthest reaches of the commuter turned out to be the little colony of Malibu , built some 30 traffic-tangled miles from the heart of Los Angeles , at a point along Highway 101A where the brush-covered Santa Monica Mountains drop down to the Pacific . One reason for Malibu 's attractiveness : when other parts of Los Angeles County are stifling with smog ( partly abetted by the exhaust fumes from the county 's 2,500,000 cars ) , Malibu , a jutting beach area , is swept clean by freakish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Late one night last week the winds , whipping across the tinder-dry , drought-grey brush and scrubland of the foothills , picked up a flicker of fire on the slope called Zuma Ridge . Instantly , a mass of blood-red flames burst forth like an explosion . Soon , the winds pushed the flames down the ridge toward the highway and the sea , then fanned the flames north and east , chewing up everything that lay in their path . <P> The word spread from house to house , almost as fast as the wind . Families piled into cars and evacuated . Fire trucks screamed in from all points . In one surge the fire burned ten homes , including that of TV Star Ralph ( This Is Your Life ) Edwards ( damage : $100,000 ) , who was already in residence at his other home in Beverly Hills . ( Movie pressagents , sniffing some profitable headlines for their clients , quickly got into the act with a string of announcements describing the tribulations of various movie folk , e.g. , Kim Novak , Jane Russell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hats got a mention when the ranch owned by her male milliners was burned . ) <P> A New Worry . By noon on the day after Christmas , 1,000 firefighters vainly were trying to hold back the flames ' onrush ; they built backfires , slashed wide firebreaks around homes with shovels and bulldozers . More families were evacuated as a second , then a third blaze ignited , joining in a savage and flaming pincer-like attack of destruction . <P> At week 's end the brush fires , burning low , had killed one man , injured 75 ( mostly firefighters ) , blackened 40,000 acres , leveled 67 homes and other structures . Estimated cost of the damage to buildings and land : $100 million . <P> Now the residents who escaped the fire will face a new kind of worry : the burned-off watershed has left nothing to absorb the inevitable heavy winter rains . As certain as there are wild winds in Malibu , there will soon be floods.                  @ @ @
