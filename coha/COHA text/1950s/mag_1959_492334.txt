Why I Love Lake Champlain By Murray Hoyt Samuel de Champlain , along with sixty Indians and two Frenchmen , discovered Lake Champlain in 1609 . I did n't discover it until 1907 . Furthermore , I was a little short on In. dians and Frenchmen . I was about two and a half years old and had to depend on my parents for transportation . And they arrived at the lake by railroad instead of by birch-bark canoe . But I loved the lake from the first day I salt it , and / will bet any man a ten-pound Lake Champlain northern pike against a scrawny little grass pickerel from some inferior lake that I 've had more enjoyment from Lake Champlain than Old Sam ever had . And that take into consideration the legend that Samue ' always retained a soft spot in his heart for Mt lake and revisits it every fifty years . The story 33 is that he cruises his lake from end to end to see what time has done to it . Those three hundred and fifty years since 609 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which see Indians fight Indians , France fight Britain . the Colonies try for independence , the Confederate States of America raid a northern Vermont city , Ireland with thousands of men invade Canada , and a **27;1598;TOOLONG paddle steamboat travel two miles inland without water , need make no apologies in the interest department , believe me . So this year when the states of Vermont and New York , and the province of Quebec celebrate the **26;1627;TOOLONG anniversary of Champlain 's discovery of the lake it will be quite an event . I. s 01 pageants , canoeeades , naval battles and land battles . And speeches in such quantity that nest minter is bound to nuld . The climax comes late in June and early in tidy enact the Champlain canoecade re-enacts Champlain 's trip down through the lake . The original trip started when Old Sam agreed to accompany a war party of assorted Huron , Montagnais and AlgonquM Indians against the Iroquois , their enemies to the south , if they would show him a beautiful lake they had told him about . The expedition paddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to become Lake Champlain . They paddled down the lake for several weeks , meeting the Iroquois in a battle which started the morning of July thirtieth . The Frenchmen used a harquebus to kill three Iroquois chiefs , whose followers , ignorant of firearms . then fled . The 1959 version of this war party will paddle down the Richelieu River into Lake Champlain in twenty-four genuine birch-Kirk canoes made by Indians in Canada last summer . The canoecade will reach isle La Moue on July fifth and from there will crisscross the lake to many towns and cities until July twenty-sixth , when re-enactment of the battle with the Iroquois will take place . Still , if you should n't see a single pageant , a single businessman looking uncomfortable in wie and light armor , or even one fake Indian putting his foot through a birch-bark canoe . I believe that just visiting my beautiful lake would repay you for the trip . Lake Champlain is a body of fresh water which separates northern New York front Vermont , and sticks up a little into Canada . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-eighth miles wide at its widest point , and 399 feet deep orr Essex , New York . It was once part of the Atlantic Ocean . then became a river , which later was dammed by glacial deposits . It ( lowed for a while into the Hudson ; later it flowed into the St. Lawrence , A year in its lifetime is like a fraction of a second in the life of old Methuselah . To my loyally , biased way of thinking , Lake Champlain is the most beautiful lake in the world  --  a lake of wide , soft vistas ; of mountains sometimes rising abruptly from its waters , sometimes well back from its shores ; of fertile farm lands ; of cities and towns : of commerce and recreation . Two thirds of the way south the lake tapers to a comfortable two- or three-mile width . Below the Champlain Midge , at Chimney Point , Vermont , it narrows more . Just above Whitehall , New York , George Washington could have thrown a thin dime across it instead of a dollar , Underhanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which parallels Lake Champlain 's southern end , is the exquisite , voluptuous calendar girl . Luke Champlain is duo nice housewife next door . Lovely , but less flamboyant ; wonderful , quiet , companionable , efficient , friendly , wearing well , useful beyond her beauty . Sometimes the lake , again like the nice housewife next door , under the stress of storm and unexpected upheaval , can become temperamental . Then , as a French-Canadian told Captain Hill of the Burlington Coast Guard , " It is more better for sail on shore . " Much more better , believe me . The waves on the broad lake , where the sweep is great , can be tremendous . When I was a small , wide-eyed , redheaded kid , my family rented a cabin cruiser for a long trip and started north from our cottage in a north wind . We got along fine until we rounded Split Rock into the broad lake , but there the lull force of the wind hit us . We dived into a couple of waves : then the motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rolled terribly . Bags , dishes , hampers and passengers landed in a heapi , t the bottom . We could n't anchor ; the water there is from 200 to 399 feet deep . My father climbed into his stiff , which we had towed , and with ii pulled the big boat around out of the trough . Then . keeping it out of the trough , he helped the wind carry IA hack within a couple of miles of home . where he towed us behind a point , repeating loudly and often all the while that never again would he set foot in anything that he could n't row . Bigger boats than that cabin cruiser have felt the force of the.lake storms . In my youth , each person throughout the length of the lake knew where , a little awed , he could point down to a number of thick-ribbed skeletons of canalboats which had fought to a gallant death at the hands of theelements . When we were trolling in Potash Bay we 'd sometimes catch our trolling spoons on the centerboard-well of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterway . At first it connected the land of the Iroquois with the land of the Algonquins , a broad pathway along which war parties , hunting parties , fishing parties paddled , They traveled mostly at night , the darker shadows that were the canoes making no sound , not even the drip of water From paddle blades , as they ghosted along the dark , timbered shores . Later the lake connected the settlements on the St. Lawrence with Albany and New York . At first travelers would portage into Lake George ; then , at the far end of that body of water , would cross to the Hudson and thus reach Albany . In 1823 the Champlain Canal was opened to carry boats from Whitehall at the end of Lake Champlain to the Hudson . When I roamed the lake , there were still the fabulous old side-wheelers , the Vermont , Ticonderoga and Chateaugay . They were the first steel-hulled steamers . The third Vermont  --  the first Vermont , in 1808. was the world 's second successful steamboat  --  was 262 feet long and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her flags flying , her red paddle wheels churning , she was a wonderful sight as she steamed daily on her round trip between . Plattsburgh and Ticonderoga on the New York shore . The others were almost as big and practically us thrilling . One of them came down into Westport , on the New York ' February side , every evening , stayed overnight , and went back the next day . On this trip she 'd droll across to the Loomis Orchard , within a couple of miles of our cottage , to load apples . We 'd see her rounding Barber 's Point and we 'd run for the canoe . We 'd watch wide-eyed while she docked , and while the stevedores loaded the apple barrels with carts at a dead run . Then there 'd be bells ringing , hoarse commands , the paddles would start to churn , the gangplank would be pulled aboard , the lines cast off , and she 'd move majestically away . We 'd watch the water at the end of the dock boil and swirl long , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pal , Sid Gage , and I dived off the upper deck of the Ticonderoga with our clothes on while she lay there loading , all because a very beautiful girl , who was engaged to a Yale football captain , bet us that we could n't . We squished our way home afterward with an expansive feeling of masculine accomplishment . Each time I saw the big boats move away I 'd remember with a little shiver my father 's story of standing off the Vermont once in his skiff to say good-by to some people , when the paddles suddenly started up . The suction began to pull him in . He began to row with all the strength and skill at his command  --  and that was considerable . But the paddles churned with full power and sucked the water in and downward . Father actually was rowing uphill . H is arms ached , his chest was restricted , and his eyes went out of focus from the strain of his efforts . The flashing red paddles came nearer and nearer in spite of everything he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he must be sucked in , the Vermont moved far enough away so that the suction lessened , then stopped . Father was left swirling in the ship 's wake , collapsed across his oars . So vivid did he make this incident that I would never come anywhere near those steamers in a small boat . Between regularly scheduled trips the Ticonderoga and the Chateaugay ran " moonlight sails . " There 'd be a small orchestra aboard for dancing , and chairs along the rail . And the romance of the moonlight . I knew something many did n't  --  that there was a very narrow little dead end up against the paddle housing , with a railing you could lean against and watch the night , dark where the rest of the boat was light . A terrific bit of knowledge for a young man squiring a young lady . When the moonlight trip was almost over , the steamer would blow her fires . A cascade of live coals would shoot out from the side and strike the water with a little hiss , And there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nine hundred watching . The lake those nights was so beautiful that it hurt you inside . All three boats are gone now . The Vermont was towed through the canal and went to operate in Atlantic waters . The Chaieougay was cut in pieces with torches and shipped to Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire to be reassembled and used as an excursion boat . The Ti C011deroga was moved two miles inland to the Shelburne Museum in Vermont . She crossed farm land , one railroad , and her trip cost hundreds of thousands of dollars . But you can board her now in the museum ground and can cat lunch aboard . Probably the little cubbyhole next to her paddle housing does no good any more for a young man in love . Even today , around eleven o'clock when the Vermont ought to be passing , I look out and wish that I might sit again on shore and wait for her waves to come in . The canalboats used to carry hay , lumber , bricks and many other items . They were towed two abreast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a tow , and they 'd move very slowly . Several times drunks who were rowing home late at night from the wet town of Port Henry , New York , to the dry town of Addison , Vermont , tried to pass between a tug and her tows , were tipped over by the towline and drowned . Each canalboat had a tiny cabin aft for the bargeman and his family . Their washing would hang out on the line , and there 'd be kids running around on deck or climbing over the deckload of lumber . The operator would cut away from the tow and hoist a sail and come in to a hay chute or a lumber-mill wharf . Then when he was loaded he 'd wait until a tow came into sight , hoist his sail , go out and intercept it . It seemed to me that life on a canalboat must be the most interesting in the whole world , and I rebelled a little against a fate which made me a college professor 's son . The canalboats gradually disappeared from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a tug nuzzled into a v in their stem . These carry oil from Bayonne , New Jersey , to storage tanks in the cities and towns on both sides of the lake . Self-propelled paper-carrying boats , under Canadian registry , now ply the lake taking paper from Canada to New York and returning with coal , sulphur and other merchandise . And once in a while there 's one of the amazing eel barges , going down to New York in late fall for the Italian holidays . The eels are netted in the Richelieu River , Lake Champlain 's outlet , and the boats that carry them are huge live-boxes with wire mesh for a bottom to allow the water to circulate . There arc still the ferries . Some cross the very broad part of the lake . For many years there were only the ferries . Then the Champlain Bridge was built across the Narrows . I went to the bridge opening by canoe and watched to see whether or not the rumor that the VITMOIli would knock her smokestack off when she first tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The bridge put out of business the ferry at the Narrows which had carried teams across the lake in my father 's youth . The boat was the old G. R. Sherman , Captain Weatherwax commanding , and she could n't run if there was a heavy north wind . I was very partial to that boat . When she could run , she kept on schedule and would n't wait for passengers coming down the hill , causing one farmer 's prim wife , who had to wait two hours for the next boat , to say , " I told that Captain Weatherwas gently but firmly that I would never ride in his boat again . " Of late years the popularity of the outboard motor has grown and grown until nowadays you seldom see a rowboat or a fishing boat being propelled with oars . And speedboats skitter across the water , some of them towing water skiers . So now Vermont is building public access areas where a boatowncr can launch his outboard boat from its trailer , spend the day enjoying Lake Champlain , reload @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and towns along the lake arc still small by modern standards . Burlington , only 37,285 , is the largest . Some " villages " in New Jersey actually are larger . In the last fifty years more and more cottages have been built along the lake shore . But still it is bordered mostly by farm land . Lake pastures allow the cattle  --  usually Holsteins because of their greater production of milk  --  to drink when they want to , and stand deep in its cool waters to keep the flies off their legs and stomachs on hot summer days . In the 83 old days the fields , seen from the lake , were dotted with haystacks , and many times on canoe trips I burrowed into them to sleep dry . Now , with the hay baler and chopper in common use , another picturesque landmark is gone . Apples are still raised in quantity in the Champlain Valley . When the orchards arc near the lake , its waters temper the air and keep away early frosts . No apple in the world , in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pops when you bite into its wonderful , juicy flesh . There has been an increase in the number of resorts along the shores . Many of the older summer-hotel-type establishments have added cottages . The delightful Basin Harbor Club is an example . New cottage colonies have sprung up . But , considering the hundreds of miles of shore line , there are still very few . I know about this business firsthand because , feeling the way I do about the lake , I could n't endure the idea of being away from her most of the year . So I built and for twenty-two years have run a cottage-camp for families , called Owl 's Head Harbor , on the Vermont side in West Addison . Thus the old lake and I have gone on living together , and she has become the woman who keeps me . Fishing still remains the lakc 's number-one attraction for city people . Champlain boasts some really tremendous northern pike , pickerel , and a few muskellunge in the Missisquoi Bay area . The largest northern pike I ever saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's record was just over nine pounds . Each year there are walleyed pike runs that under ideal conditions net terrific catches in the Winooski River area , and just south of the Champlain Bridge . Lake Champlain bass jump just a little higher and fight just a little harder than those in other lakes , I like to think . Yellow perch arc plentiful and tasty . There are the little-known fish , too , such as the skin ling and the scale ling , the sheepshead , the sturgeon , the billfish , the eel , the mullet , the mooneye . A skin ling looks something like a compressed eel . The Lake Champlain sheepshead is a member of the drum family and has two stones in its head which have to do with its hearing apparatus . The stones each have a scroll L  --  if you use your imagination a little  --  and arc supposed to be lucky . I 've seen earrings and other jewelry items made from them . If you fry or bake the sheepshead , its Flesh gets harder and harder  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh is boiled correctly and served with thick cream dressing , it 's a gourmet item . The fresh-water mullet is like a sucker , and the mooneye is like a shad . Once found a dead sturgeon on my shore that weighed over a hundred pounds . He had a round mouth set back and underneath , with a cartilage ring and membrane that pulled out six or eight inches like a tube  --  a handy instrument for sucking things off the bottom . We pulled him to higher ground with ice tongs and had a picture taken so we could send copies to friends with the message , " As soon as you left , look what we caught . " In the days when I was a boy , the farmers used to troll for northern pike a lot . They trolled on Sundays and on rainy days when they could n't work on the farm . They hammered trolling spoons out of something they stole from their wife 's spoon drawer when she was n't looking . That 's how trolling spoons came to be called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poles that got the spoon out away from the shadow of the boat , but still allowed them to get hold of it quickly by lifting the pole in the air if it became fouled in weeds . at Ve used the same rig . When I was too little to hold the pole , I 'd sit in the bow . The moment l proved I could lift the pole . I graduated to one of the fishing seats an . There I 'd sit , a hay redheaded hump on the end of a long yellow pole , not much more than my head and shoulders showing atvo.se the gunwale . Ve fished every morning except Sunday between our cottage and the farmhouse where wt. ' bought milk . Those were wonderful Mornings . Once a guest of my father 's had the bamboo pole held with his knees , while both hts hands were occupied in holding a joke book . A northern pike hit suddenly , jerked the pole from under his knees , across the gunwale and away ' . The fish headed out into deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skiff , backed in pursuit . 1 finally caught hold of the pole , and my father , who hated to lose a fish and was disgusted with the guest , told me to play it . I played it for half an hour and brought it in . It weighed nine and one quarter pounds and broke the record for our cottage , which I had held previously . To my chagrin . my father decreed that the championship now was held by the guest . I was about eight years old , and losing that record was a bitter blow . I later said to my father , " But he did n't have anything to do with the fish except hold his pole wrong . " My father said , " But it was his pole . " So that 's how it was , l held in until I could go away by myself and lie atop the Mg rock in Potash Bay . And there I cried it out , the prerogative of all small boys who have suffered a great disappointment . Fishing is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge in December , below Split Rock usually in January , and the broad lake not until late February . People drive on the ice , and back in horse-and-buggy times timisevergreens were cut and spaced to mark the route so that in snowstorms a driver would not wander in circles and perhaps perish . Many a driver took a chance , and dropped his team and wagon  --  and sometimes himself  --  through the ice . After the lake freezes , in certain good fishing spots villages of shanties mushroom on the ice , their owners for the most part after smelt . Inside these fish shanties , with a fire going in the stove , you sit in shirt sleeves and fish through trap doors in the floor that match up with holes in the ice . You use a strip cut from the side of a smelt for bait , and you jig with the line constantly to make the bait dart like a minnow . You can look down into the water and see hundreds of the shadowy fish passing . They bite best in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shanties are dragged out onto the toe on runners . When the ice is glare , they have to be anchored so that the wind wo n't blow them away . A little old man named Charley Gooley , whom I knew and revered as a boy , once failed to anchor his shanty and it got away . Another friend , Rob Moorby , stuck his head out of his shanty just as Charley 's shelter whooshed past . Charley was clinging to the doorway and looking worried . " Rob ! Rob ! Where am I going ? " he called . And Rob called back . " Depends mostly on the life you 've led , Charley . " There arc many reminders around Lake Champlain of its place in the path of history . Things which happened on its waters have changed the lives of millions of people . Old Sam Champlain 's fight with the Iroquois so infuriated the Six Nations that they hated and fought the French for generations . Without them the French might never have been driven out of upper New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Revolution and he part of Canada row , II ' its true that Old Sam returns , he must have been astounded at the repercussions of a canoe trip and a few shots from a harquebus . On May 10 , 1775 , at four o'clock in the morning , Ethan Allen and others , with a very inadequate number of bouts , managed to ferry about eighty men from the Vermont shore to a spot within half a mile of Fort Ticonderoga . Just as day was breaking they attacked a wicket gate , the sentry 's gun misfired , and they took Fort Ticonderoga , " In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress . " This must have confused the British commander , Captain William Del-. aplace , because the Second Continental Congress had n't yet assembled  --  in fact , met for the first time that same morning in Philadelphia . There never has been any question but that Ethan and Benedict Arnold were the first two to enter the fort . But I 've talked to at least a hundred people whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnold 's fleet fought the British fleet and was defeated at the battle of Valcour Island . He slipped away in the darkness and mist , and ran his flagship and some other boats into a small bay , later called Arnold 's Bay , where he burned them to the water line . You could find the hulls there in the water when I was a boy , but later they were raised by divers . The battle itself , though a defeat . so delayed the British that winter set in before they could follow up their advantage . In early July of the next year Burgoyne finally recaptured Fort Ticonderoga for the British by dragging cannon up the impossible Mount Defiance . The American troops crossed the lake in darkness and retreated to Hubbardion , Vermont , where they were overtaken . They fought from behind trees , Indian-style , and were finally defeated by the arrival of three hundred fresh troops . The Celebration Committee has tentative plans for the reenactment of the Hubbardion battle this summer with 2000 men participating . This will certainly he worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that with 2000 actors and even more spectators , the parking problem will be acute , something the original participants never had to think about . In an effort to control the lake during the War of 1812 , Commodore Thomas Macdonough achieved one of the greatest shipbuilding feats of all time at Vergennes , Vermont . On March second he selected trees growing in the forest , on March seventh the keel of a ship was laid , and on April eleventh the Saratoga , mounting twenty-six guns , was launched . Other ships were built at the same time , and they brought the United States enough strength so that , though outgunned ninety-two to eighty-six , they challenged the British for supremacy at the Battle of Plattsburgh . Macdonough chose his position carefully and devised a multiple-anchor setup which , by pulling on different lines , allowed him to turn his ships . When all the guns in his starboard battery had been silenced , Macdonough swung the Saratoga around . The British flagship , unable to do the same thing , was no match for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-enacted this summer . It 's going to be interesting to watch sailors of the motor-boat era try to turn the Saratoga at the proper time . During the Civil War , twenty-two Confederate soldiers in disguise , some traveling down from Canada by boat on the lake , gathered quietly in St. Albans , Vermont . There they suddenly took over the city for a period of about three hours . They captured three banks and commandeered horses . They then galloped the horses back into Canada , carrying the contents of the banks as a reward for their farthest-north victory . One citizen was killed during the raid . Late last summer three masked men rode into St. Albans , claiming the Southerners were outraged by the wording of the historical plaque regarding this incident , and covered the plaque with a cloth . At last report the police still wanted them for double parking , Least known of all are the Fenian Raids of 1866 and 1870 , which the committee will by no means overlook . The Fenian Brotherhood , a secret Irish society sworn to free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100,000 men , most of them Irish veterans of the North 's forces in the Civil War . About a fifth of that number actually showed up at the three staging areas along our northern border . The big push was to be near Buffalo , but the right-hand spearhead was to attack with over a thousand men through the Champlain Valley in Vermont . The United States Government cut off the supply lines of the main raid and arrested the participants . The Champlain attack was confined to skirmishes and cattle stealing . Four years later a second attempt was made in Vermont , but after an afternoon of fighting at the border , one leader was arrested , another wounded , and the pangs of hunger became strong . The Fenians gave up their attempt . So help me . I 'm not making this up . It actually happened . Here are some events and places which wo n't be listed in the anniversary pro grain , but might make a visitor 's tour more enjoyable . You can get a terrific view of the whole area by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Burlington . Or from Mount Defiance at Ticonderoga on the New York side . If you 're willing to climb on foot , there 's Bald Peak , reached out of Mineville , New York , and Grand View Mountain , which lies south of Vergennes on 22A . Not many tourists find these , but their view ; are breath-taking . If you 're camping , you might like Crown Point Reservation , right at the Narrows where a lot of the fighting took place , or Sand Bar Bridge State Park , north of Burlington . Both have fine swimming and fishing and camp sites . You 'd enjoy going to Battery Park in the city of Burlington , to sit high on a bluff in the late afternoon and watch the sunset over the lake and maybe a ferry making its way in , Everybody knows about Fort Ticonderoga and its excellent restoration , but not many know that north at the Narrows where the Champlain Bridge crosses , there are two forts  --  the old French Fort St. Frederic , and the English Fort Crown Point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you how to reach them . The Army must have been the same in those days , because the men 's barracks are about gone , the noncoms ' barracks are in fair repair , and the officers ' barracks are in fine shape by comparison . Near the forts is the Champlain Memorial Lighthouse which was built to commemorate the lake 's **27;1655;TOOLONG celebration . My father took me to the dedication when 1 was five , and I remember only that I sat on the grass and saw real Indians . if you come to Champlain in spring , the apple blossoms in Grand Isle and the Heros are very beautiful . The walleye-run , south of the Champlain Bridge , comes usually a couple of weeks each side of Memorial Day . In the fall when the mountains and woods turn to flaming colors , the foliage display is likely to be at its height by Columbus Day . If you travel by cruiser or yacht into the lake , either up from the Hudson or down the Richelieu , do n't miss a trip up the Otter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Split Rock Mountain , between Split Rock and Westport , New York . This is one of the wildest , most beautiful areas left in the whole of the eastern United States . The mountains drop into the water , and the water is over 200 feet deep only a few feet from the land . There are beautiful little harbors there , as well as the steep Palisades . Once I rode along the length of this mountain in the moonlight aboard the Ticonderoga . It was so breathtaking that I waited for a friend beside me to make some appropriate comment . After a long time he said , " There 's certainly a lot of waste land around here . " Maybe I 've proved by now that I 've had more from Lake Champlain than Old Sam ever had . I brought my bride to the lake . I was on the lake when a sheet hung on a tree on our point signaled me to race for home because my daughter was showing signs of wanting to be horn . For years the lake deposited my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of waking to hear geese honking their way south , theneve been ducks coming into my blind , and big fish taking my spoon . When I was a kid and the summer was at art end and school in Worcester was only a couple of days off , I used to sit in the bow of thecanoe and try to keep my folks from seeing any tears . I 'm afraid I would still feel HthEat sam if I ever had to leave this , my one and only Lake Champlain.
