When the N.C.A.A. introduced the free substitution rule for football back in 1941 , the theory was that more boys would be able to play , injuries would be reduced and smaller colleges would get a chance to make the best use of their football talent . In practice , things worked out just the opposite . More boys played , but they became the robot-like specialists of the two-platoon system ; injuries increased because the players never got a chance to warm up again after riding the bench ; and more than 50 colleges quit football because they had neither the money nor the manpower to support the huge two-platoon squads . Last week , abruptly ending an unhappy era , the N.C.A.A. 's football rules committee abolished the two-platoon system , gave the game back to the all-round man-and the spectators . <P> Reaction to the new substitution rule* was immediate , often indignant , but generally downright delighted . Surprisingly , some of football 's big-time coaches , who have the money and manpower to benefit from the two-platoon game , were in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's in the best interests of the game . The two-platoon system has a tendency to make big teams bigger and little teams weaker . " Colorado Mines ' Coach Fritz Brennecke saw other benefits : " It will reduce the pressure on recruiting and finances . . . Everyone will have to know how to block and tackle . " <P> Coaches opposed to going back to football fundamentals had a harder time explaining their position . Southern Methodist 's Rusty Russell , who bosses a 150-man squad , sputtered : " I do n't like it . . . Who 's going to keep books on the players ? " Wisconsin 's Ivy Williamson , whose team lost in the Rose Bowl , could only mutter that " football wo n't be the same without the two-platoon system . It made for a better game . " Said Ohio State 's Woody Hayes , whose goman squad gets its practice for only an hour and 20 minutes daily : " We simply can not train a boy to play offense and defense in that time . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weaned on two-platoon play , have turned against the system . Speaking for the majority , Columbia 's record-breaking Passer Mitch Price explained : " You get a psychological lift from playing both ways . You 're in the game more , and if you 're pushed around on offense , you get a chance to even up on defense . " Added Dartmouth Coach Tuss McLaughry , who coached Brown 's famed " Iron Man " eleven of 1926 : " The basic philosophy of the two-platoon system has been all wrong . Now we can go back and play the game like it was for 75 years . . . the way it ought to be played . " <P> <P> * Gist of the new rule : a player , once taken out of the game , may not return until the next period , except in the second and fourth quarters , when he may return for the final four minutes of play .
