The Yale philosophy department has all sorts-logical positivists and metaphysicians ( e.g. , Carl Hempel and Paul Weiss ) , Agnostic F.S.C. Northrop , Physicist Henry Margenau , Idealist Theodore Greene . Last week , Yale added the final diversity-a Thomist , and the only Jesuit professor at any big non-Catholic university in the U.S. <P> The man Yale picked for next year is the Rev. John Courtney Murray , 46 , a tall ( 6 ft. 4 in. ) , cucumber-cool intellectual who teaches theology at Woodstock ( Md . ) College , but is famed far beyond . Father Murray is a towering figure among U.S. Catholic scholars . A polite and learned defender of the faith , he edits the erudite quarterly , Theological Studies ( he will continue to do so at Yale ) , and is the spearhead of a bold attempt to reconcile traditional Catholic church-state doctrine with U.S. practice . <P> The son of a New York lawyer , Murray always wanted to be a priest . His taste for study led him to the Jesuits . After taking an M.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Philippines , then went to Rome for a doctorate at Gregorian University . In 1937 he joined the faculty of Woodstock . <P> He will find Yale quite a change after 14 years at Woodstock . There he taught in Latin , and by the time his students came to him they had already traveled far-two years of classical studies , three years of philosophy , three more of teaching in Jesuit colleges all over the world . <P> Father Murray looks forward to introducing Yalemen to Thomism : " I want to show it is a rational philosophy , that it 's acceptable intellectually , not only because great intellectuals of previous ages have accepted it , but in itself as a mode and body of thought . If I ca n't make my students see it , that 's the end . " The betting at Woodstock is that Murray will make them see it .
