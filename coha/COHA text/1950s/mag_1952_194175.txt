Streaking across the Air Force proving grounds at Muroc Lake , Calif. , Northrop Aircraft 's new fighter seemed for a moment to explode in the air . From the big pods at the wing tips , great puffs of smoke and flame shot out . The explosions were the blasts from showers of rockets shot from the pods . They gave the " Scorpion , " said the Air Force , the heaviest firepower of any U.S. fighter . Although the big , heavy Scorpion is full of radar equipment , it can climb higher than 40,000 ft . Its radar eyes can search out an enemy plane in night or thick weather , " lock " the Scorpion on a collision course with the enemy , and when within range , automatically fire its rockets . The new interceptor , which the " Air Force expects to be in the first line of defense against atomic attack , has already earned an admiring nickname from Northrop 's workers : the " Grand Slam . " <P> Last week , the Grand Slam gave Northrop 's President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had long looked like a losing game . To Northrop Aircraft , which had more than once lost heavily on postwar wrong guesses , the Air Force was readying $154 million in contracts for the new plane , which would bring Northrop 's total backlog to $389 million . <P> Hard Times . Jack Northrop began designing an all-weather interceptor six years ago , when no enemy had any A-bombs to drop on the U.S. Northrop has i habit of looking ahead . A onetime garage mechanic , he helped found Lockheed Aircraft , designed the Lockheed Vega , used by Wiley Post on his two flights around the world and by Amelia Earhart on her second transatlantic flight in 1932 . On his own , Northrop built the Alpha , forerunner of the modern low-wing , all-metal monoplane , and pioneered multicellular metal construction in commercial airplanes . He had long dreamed of an all-wing ( i.e. , Flying Wing ) as the plane of the future , and had flown a prototype . After a spell working for Douglas Aircraft as a vice president bossing the El Segundo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally launched his own small plant in 1939 . <P> Like all the others , it mushroomed during World War II . At the peak , Northrop had 10,000 employees , turned out $280 million worth of planes and parts , including 1,000 of his P-61 Black Widow night fighters . Like many another builder , Northrop also lost millions on postwar ventures into nonaircraft projects ( among Northrop 's bad bets : motor scooters and calculating machines ) . He also bet on a three-engine transport plane and his long cherished Flying Wing . The transport was behind its time , the Flying Wing ahead of it . The Government , which had staked both to $80 million worth of postwar orders , canceled them , left Northrop floundering .
