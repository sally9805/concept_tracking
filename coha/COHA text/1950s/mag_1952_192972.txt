In the midst of the Davis Cup tennis match , Referee Cliff Sproule waved his hand and stopped play . The Sydney Stadium crowd began to buzz as Sproule got up and walked to the front-row grandstand seat , where U.S. Coach Jack Kramer was sitting . The referee spoke to Professional Kramer briefly , turned on his heel , and went over to speak to U.S. Captain Frank Shields and Australian Captain Harry Hopman . Then Sproule ordered play resumed . <P> Sproule 's action was new for big tennis matches , but so were a few other items on the Davis Cup program last week . Sproule had apparently caught Kramer coaching from the sidelines , a breach of tennis etiquette . As it turned out , etiquette took a bad beating-almost as bad as the trouncing Australia 's Frank Sedgman gave the U.S. team . <P> The Line-Up . When U.S. Captain Shields announced his team line-up before the matches , he chose veteran ( 30 ) Ted Schroeder and Johnny-come-lately ( 28 ) Vic Seixas to play singles . As expected , Schroeder was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's choice placed an almost unbearable burden on semi-retired Schroeder , and it ignored the man who , on the basis of his Wimbledon and Australian championships , is generally considered the U.S. 's No. 1 player . Dick Savitt , who had been blasted earlier by Shields for his " stupid " play , promptly sounded off : " I still think the deal was arranged before we ever left America . I 've been beating Ted in practice . " <P> Beating Ted seemed to be the order of the day last week . After Seixas put the U.S. team in the lead by routing Mervyn Rose , 6-3 , 6-4 , 9-7 , Ted took the court against Sedgman . The Aussie , displaying the resounding all-court game that won him the U.S. title , whipped through Schroeder , 6-4 , 6-3 , 4-6 , 6-4 . This tied the teams at one match apiece and paved the way for the vital doubles point against the Aussies ' Sedgman and Ken McGregor , U.S. , Wimbledon and Australian title holders . <P> The Letdown . The Aussies had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order , they said later , to make the U.S. team overconfident . In the match , Schroeder and Trabert did not suffer from overconfidence ; they suffered from Schroeder 's slipshod play . Schroeder was the only player on the court to lose his service , four times in all . Although generally considered a slam-bang player , Schroeder scored only three placements . Trabert had 17 , McGregor had 19 , and the indefatigable Sedgman had 24 . The Aussies won handily , 6-2 , 9-7 , 6-3 . <P> With the chips down , Schroeder finally evened the matches at 2-all by beating Rose , with Kramer 's sideline coaching , 6-4 , 13-11 , 7-5 . But it was too late . Sedgman was at the peak of his form as he slashed through Seixas , 6-4 , 6-2 , 6-2 , to keep the venerable cup in Australia for the second straight year .
