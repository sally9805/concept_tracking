One after another , French governments came and went , but the shadowy figure of Roger Wybot stayed on , one of the few permanent fixtures of the Fourth Republic . A former leader of the French underground , Wybot had been made head of France 's crack counterintelligence service in 1945 when he was only 33 . Under him , the Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire spread so far , wide and mysteriously that it was once described as " a gigantic spider web , in the middle of which waits Wybot , his pipe in his mouth , in his soundproof office on the Rue des Saussaies . " Some said that Wybot had compiled so many compromising dossiers that no French politician would ever dare to oust him . <P> An aloof and solitary bachelor , who liked to paint , cultivate roses and ponder mathematics , he lived in a strange Paris apartment that consisted of three rooms on three floors . The legends about him spread : that he hypnotized those he was questioning by spinning a small silver spoon as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his side named Nero had once guarded Germany 's Hermann Gring . One morning last December , France awoke to surprising news : without a word of explanation , Premier Charles de Gaulle had fired Wybot as chief of the D.S.T. and banished him to a dusty office as inspector of police schools . <P> Last week , enterprising French Journalist Merry Bromberger , a man with good sources , turned up the story behind Wybot 's fall . Last May 30 , as De Gaulle was conferring in his quarters at the Htel La Prouse , where he had held court out of office almost every Wednesday for 13 years , his son-in-law rose , suspiciously examined a cornice , lifted a piece of carpet , and discovered microphones . <P> <P> Six months later , reported Bromberger , thinking to impress his chief with the thoroughness of his operation , Wybot marched into the office of the Minister of the Interior with the tapes of the May conversation . The next day he was ousted from his job . De Gaulle 's son-in-law declared that Wybot had been " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past 13 years . But what really enraged De Gaulle himself was the fact that Wybot 's duties involved only foreign espionage and not internal security ; did Wybot therefore consider De Gaulle 's patriotism suspect ? As for the ever-reticent Wybot , he denied having anything to do with the tapes , insisted that the microphones were not his . " Maybe , " said Roger Wybot helpfully , " they belonged to one of the other services . "
