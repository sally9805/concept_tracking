Proclaimed Radio Peking : " People 's ( i.e. , Chinese Communist Army units ... have been ordered to advance into Tibet to free 3,000,000 Tibetans from imperialist oppression and to consolidate national defense of the western borders of China . . . " The Red army was striking from Sikang and Tsinghai provinces , in China 's far west , toward the formidable 15,000-ft. passes into the bleak Tibetan plateau . <P> In New Delhi , India 's Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru could hardly believe the news . For months he had championed China 's Communist regime , urged a seat for it in the U.N. , pictured its leaders as popular reformers , served them as a channel to the skeptical non-Communist world . He thought he had Mao Tse-tung 's promise that the Tibetan issue would be settled amicably . He expected that Tibet could keep its traditional autonomy under nominal Chinese sovereignty . <P> Nehru even encouraged negotiations between the Tibetans and the Red masters of China . Last April a seven-man delegation , headed by Finance Minister Tsepon Shakabpa , made the arduous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamasery-studded capital of Tibet . They waited five months for the arrival of General Yuan Chung-hsien , the new Chinese Communist Ambassador to India . When he arrived , the Red envoy suggested the Tibetans go on to Peking .

Disturbed and dismayed , Nehru summoned his cabinet in emergency sessions . Impatiently he cabled his ambassador in Peking , bearded Kavalam Madhava Panikkar , who is proud of resembling Nikolai Lenin and who has an unshakable belief that India can get along with Lenin 's disciples . Panikkar did not answer for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining that he had first heard of it through the papers . <P> " Extraordinary , " fumed New Delhi 's Foreign Ministry . Then it bitterly announced : " The Government of India . . . have communicated their surprise and regret ... to the Chinese Government .. . " <P> A spokesman added that India would now give " very careful review " to her sponsorship of Red China . But in New York , Sir Benegal Rau , India 's U.N . delegate , indicated that India was still a glutton for diplomatic punishment . Said he : " If the new government of China had been seated in the U.N. , . . . it might have deterred any invasion . " <P> " Element of Fear . " In Kashmir over the weekend , Nehru still clung to his confusion . He attributed Red China 's attitude toward Tibet to an " element of fear " in Peking .
