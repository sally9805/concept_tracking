txt In a further effort to restore national unity and bipartisan teamwork in foreign policy , President Truman has appointed John Foster Dulles as topranking adviser and consultant to Secretary Acheson with global responsibilities in respect to both broad problems in foreign affairs and the snecific lines of action which the United States should follow . Mr. Dulles , long recognized as one of the outstanding Republican experts and spokesmen on foreign affairs , has already rendered distinguished service both as adviser to the State Department and as member of American delegations to international conferences and the United Nations . Now he will have a desk in the State Department itself , will have complete access to all documents in it which he did not have in the past , and will be in daily conference with the Secretary of State to perfect a policy which the American people as a whole , and irrespective of party , can support . This is a welcome development which , in the words of Governor Dewey , is good for the country . As Mr. Dulles himself said in accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold war in which the Soviets are carrying out methodically , ruthlessly , and with much success , a long-laid program for the encirclement and strangulation of the United States . At such a time partisanship in foreign policy must be silent and all who love freedom must unite behind policies to cope with the ever-mounting danger of a spreading despotism . Fortunately , on that paramount issue Mr. Acheson and Mr. Dulles now pee eye to eye . Mr. Dulles has not only repudiated Republican attacks on Mr. Acheson personally but has specifically endorsed the latter 's analysis of Soviet-American tensions . Finally , he has called on all , including Republican critics of our China policy , to rally from a frustrating confusion that has its roots in mistakes of the past rather than in circumstances of the present . The fact that the announcement of his appointment specifically mentions , the Far East as among the fields in which his advice will be sought suggests that any new Asiatic policy that may develop will this time be made with Republican participation and support . There are indications- that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet risen to the same level of unpartisanship and that Mr. Truman himself sought to by-pass Mr. Dulles because of the latter 's criticism of the Administration 's domestic policy during the ' recent Senatorial campaign . But in the end the wiser counsels of both Senator Vandenberg and Mr. Acheson prevailed , with the result that there are now two Republican advisers to the State Department , Mr. Dulles and John Sherman Cooper . No doubt the Administration 's desire to counteract Republican criticism of the State Department contributed to the decision , which gives Republican leadership in foreign affairs to the international rather than the isolationist wing of the party . But we believe that President Truman himself has found that partisanship in foreign policy does not pay , and that strict adherence to his pledge to Mr Dulles never and under no circumstances to permit partisan considerations to influence his conduct of foreign policy will be the ' best policy for him , for the United States and for the world .                 @ @ @ @
