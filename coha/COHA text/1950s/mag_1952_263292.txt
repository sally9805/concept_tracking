Though France 's old ( 80 ) Edouard Herriot is nowadays something of a cipher , he is also something of a symbol . Associated in most minds with the stirring days of Aristide Briand and the invincible Clemenceau . Herriot is 1 ) President ( Speaker ) of the French National Assembly , 2 ) leader of the influential rightist Radical Socialist Party . Last week Herriot the symbol threw a symbolic wrench into the delicate engineering of the European Defense Community . <P> Standing before a 16-ft. portrait of himself at a Radical Socialist congress in Bordeaux , Herriot attacked the six-nation treaty which would set up a multinational European army against Communist aggression . Said Herriot : " Does this treaty conform to our Constitution ? I say no ... All the provisions of this treaty work to put France in a position of inferiority . " Herriot 's specific objections : 1 ) under articles 12 and 13 , the Germans , and all other nations , could withdraw troops from the joint army on the pretext of putting down domestic disturbances , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morocco or Tunisia , she would have to ask permission of the European Command " like a minor " ; 2 ) Article I : gives Germany the right to have a militia , like the paramilitary formations that were the nucleus of Hitler 's army ; 3 ) Britain is not a party to the treaty . Said Herriot : " I say to my American friends that it is impossible for us to accept a document containing so many menaces . It is impossible that our American friends would condemn France to death . " <P> Some Paris newspapers called his speech a turning point in French foreign policy . But support for ratification came from such veteran statesmen as Ren Pleven and Paul Reynaud , who argued that the plan to bring West German troops into a European army is specifically designed to prevent the rebirth of the Wehrmacht . Premier Antoine Pinay , who needs the support of the Radical Socialists ( 75 seats ) to stay in power , was quoted as saying : " I am for a European army , but <P> I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them give us soldiers , nothing more . " The French Foreign Ministry hurriedly denied that he had said such a tactless thing . In view of Herriot 's opposition and Pinay 's lukewarm support , ratification by the French Parliament is still possible , but chancier than ever .
