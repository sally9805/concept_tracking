With last week 's landing of U.S. reinforcements , the odds in Korea , while still heavily against the U.S. , were beginning to even up . The U.S. now has part of five infantry divisions in Korea ( 24th , 25th , 2nd , 1st Cavalry , 1st Marine ) . With several independent combat units , U.S. strength added up to about 60,000 men . Most of them are still inadequately equipped but more and more materiel is flowing in daily . There are still virtually no reserves to provide rest periods for the men at the front . Fighting with the U.S. , are perhaps 50,000 ill-equipped South Koreans . <P> The North Koreans have an estimated ten well-equipped divisions in the line , approximately 100,000 men . They have a reserve of draftees numbering no less than 50,000 , and another reserve force of between 60,000 and 90,000 attached to the Chinese Communist army in Manchuria .
