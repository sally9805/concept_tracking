" Woof ! Woof ! " said Andr Kostelanetz ' score . " Woof ! Woof ! " yelped a pretty young lady as the conductor gave her the cue . Then Kostelanetz turned gracefully away from Washington 's National Symphony Orchestra to a man standing in front of the podium , who promptly let fly across the stage with a bowling ball and scored a clean-and noisy-strike . Kostelanetz beamed at the rumble and thud . A few minutes later the music sped up to sound like a bustling city : a rescue-squad man started a wailing siren , a park policeman astride his motorcycle to the right of the stage blew his whistle . <P> The occasion for all the special effects was the world premiere of Ferde ( Grand Canyon Suite Grof 's latest effort as a musical local-colorist , Hudson River Suite , in Washington , D.C. 's leafy Carter Barren Amphitheater . Its five movements describe 1 ) The River , with quickened tempo as it surges past Bear Mountain , and broad majesty as it reaches the Palisades ; 2 ) Hendrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woodwinds and thundering percussion , often wistful because of his tragic end ; 3 ) Rip Van Winkle , a clever description of the Washington Irving tale , in which Rip whistles for his dog ( which answers " Woof ! Woof ! " ) , watches the dwarfs play at ninepins , has a couple of drinks while the bassoons rollick , sleeps it off and then calls for his dog ( no " Woof " ) ; 4 ) The Albany Night Boat , mostly moonlight and summer , and a five-piece Dixieland band on deck ; 5 ) New York , a one-minute explosion in which the percussionists and their public-service assistants beat , squeeze , crank , . crash and blow vigorously . <P> At the end of its first rehearsal last week , Conductor Kostelanetz bounded off the podium and congratulated rotund Composer Grof . " You really started something , " said Grof . Actually , whether the result was more effective as music or just enthusiastically collected noise , it was " Kosty " himself who started it . For seven years he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grof in New York City . Grof read a book about the river , recalled some river lore of his own ( at six months he rode an Albany boat for two weeks to escape an epidemic on the Lower East Side ) , and sat down to compose in his study overlooking the Pacific Ocean . A fortnight ago the score was finished and airmailed to Kostelanetz . <P> " I 've never used so many effects before , " said Grof . But he had no cause to worry about his amateur specialists . The motorcycle policeman took the assignment in stride ( " I do n't feel much different ; I can handle it " ) and the siren man was even more blas about his symphonic debut ( " Does n't bother me ; I used to be in the Bethesda-Chevy Chase High School Band " ) . Sally Herman , who does the barking , is a 25-year-old credit assistant at George Washington University Hospital . She landed the job unexpectedly by winning an audition over five real dogs . " I 've never barked professionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
