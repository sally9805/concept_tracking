THE NEW REPUBLIC I The 1956 campaign began in an atmosphere of political uncertainty . A good deal of water had gone over the dam since Eisenhower had discounted Communism as a major political issue in the United States . In the inter ? val McCarthyism had been killed off . The question in the minds of Democrats was whether Nixon and the Republican Old Guard would agree that the security issue had been disposed of , or whether the Vice Presi ? dent , for lack of anything more popular as a debating ground , would return to his charge that the Democratic Party was soft on Communism . Nixon 's role , it was tacitly conceded , was the major imponderable since Eisenhower clearly would not tax his strength with the kind of campaign he had waged four years earlier . Washington columnists as early as December , 1955 , floated reports that the President 's illness had caused Nixon to reconsider his posture on the national scene . The stridency of his ambition , it was said , had mellowed because , to his surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but were widely read as the utterances of a man who might well be President . His new status sobered him , so the legend went ; and to prove it there were reports that he had cast about for speech writers to help modulate his pronouncements . The campaign was slow getting under way , and Nixon made his preparations with the deliberation of a veteran . By September 9 he had scheduled a pulse-feeling excur ? sion into 32 states ; and having so set the stage , he met privately at the White House with President Eisen ? hower to agree on the line each would follow on the stump . He told newsmen next day , as he prepared to begin work on his basic speech , that his mission would be to counter Democratic " distortions " of the record " vigorously and aggressively so that people will know that they have something to fight for . " And with a nos ? talgic genuflection to the Chotiner influence , he added : " You ca n't win by wishy-washy milktoast . " It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sunday-best facsimile . As for the capital cloakroom jargon of the moment - talk of the " new Nixon " as something less bloodthirsty than the slugger who had infuriated opponents in earlier campaigns ? he remained smoothly noncommittal . The individual , he said , " is least qualified to judge whether he is new or old . " The curtain-raiser for the campaign was a folksy , enthusiastic picnic for 600 key party workers Septem ? ber 13 at the Eisenhower farm at Gettysburg . The Presi ? dent played host under a big tent in a pasture ; he circu ? lated busily in the crowd shaking hands , lined up with his guests at a buffet table to eat fried chicken , and shared star billing with Nixon on the speaking program . In tone if not in the substance of his apparently dis ? cursive remarks , Ike set the keynote for the campaign . Saying , " I feel fine , " and looking it , the President threw away his prepared notes and delivered an informal pep talk in which he took for himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , allud ? ing boldly to the issue of his own health , as he had from the beginning , he went on to assure the assemblage : " There is no man in the history of America who has had such a careful preparation as has Vice President Nixon for carrying out the duties of the Presidency , if that duty should ever fall on him . " In the light of that statement there could be no blink ? ing at the fact that Nixon was a central figure if not the central issue of the campaign . The Vice President in turn reflected the shifting scale of values ; he defined his primary responsibility in the terms which by now had grown familiar to audiences from coast to coast , even to the solemn assurance of which he seemed never to tire : " You do n't win campaigns with a diet of dishwater and milktoast ! " He went on to deny that the Democrats were the party of the poor and that Republicans were only for the rich and big business ; he ridiculed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with corrup NOVEMBER x6 , 1959 tion ; he accused Stevenson of political fakery for voic ? ing a hope that the draft might soon be ended , and twitted the Democratic nominee for his failure to give the Supreme Court 's school integration ruling his four ? square endorsement . Ike and Mamie beamed at the platform sallies ; the guests were noisily , cheerfully partisan ; and the picnic set a tone of genial party strife , a far cry from the desperate climate of mistrust that had prevailed two years earlier . Nixon 's actual campaigning began early on the morn ? ing of September 18 . The scene was the Terrace Dining Room of the Washington National Airport . Present to signalize the occasion was President Eisenhower him ? self , breakfasting with the . Vice President and a group of other GOP campaigners . Nixon had ahead of him six weeks of the most arduous hedgehopping and whistle-stopping , 33,00o miles in 32 states . Ike was in a rosy , confident mood , and he was ready with a characteristic homily . " The record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently clear to all Americans , " he assured the Vice President . " And that should be our campaign . " To make his message wholly clear , the Pres ? ident added benignly that there was " no need to indulge in the exaggerations of partisan political talk " nor to " claim perfection . " That was the official enunciation of the party line . The President was on hand with a parting salute because it was the least he could do for a man undertaking that most difficult of all missions the task of stating an ? other man 's case for him ? but he was there on his own terms , not on Nixon 's . However reluctant Eisenhower was to do his own stumping , whether for reasons of health or otherwise , he undertook to lay out the ground rules for the struggle , rules that did not encourage the Chotiner-Nixon style of in-fighting . In the circumstances , the professionals had to accept the President 's battle plan as a calculated risk . They had barely won control of Congress in ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost heavily in ' 54 after an all-out slugging match . The reasonable infer ? ence was that there was no magic in the party name or image , and that even slugging had its limitations . That being so , what remained in their arsenal was the Eisen ? hower magic . If that could still win ? even if only on a diet of dishwater and milktoast ? it had to win for both itself and the party . Exorcising the Old Nixon For lack of another issue , the President 's health con ? tinued to hold the center of the stage . The Republicans might not have preferred it that way but it was not theirs to choose . And the focal point of that issue , quite logically and inevitably , was Vice President Nixon . The , voter had only to ask himself ? or be invited to by a Democrat ? whether a Republican ticket deserved to win if the man who might succeed to the Presidency was of questionable fitness for the highest office in the land . So long as the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opinion about Nixon was still divided . One of the Vice President 's avowed admirers , Richard Wilson , wrote in Look that his biggest problem was still " to overcome the impression in some groups , particularly those who think of themselves as intellectuals , that some undefined tricky quality in Nixon makes him un ? suited for the Presidency . " The Madison ( Wis . ) Capital Times argued with frank belligerency that the problem was " how to exploit Nixon 's unquestionable capacity for smear-type campaigning and at the same time proj ? ect the image of Eisenhower as a unifier and pacifier above the political battles . " The origin of the 1956 strategy ? whether it was con ? ceived by the Vice President alone or in concert with Administration and party advisers ? has never been re ? vealed . At any rate , the Republican high command let itself be persuaded that the task of the campaign was to exorcise the old , controversial Nixon personality . If the Vice President was to be propped up as the spokesman and filial image of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with a veneer of states ? manship and Eisenhowerism . Nixon embraced the strategy skillfully . He was billed as the traveling salesman of Republicanism but his chief product was no longer to be the party . His tactic , when the precinct workers yelled for the taste of raw meat , was to offer instead the composite Eisenhower-Nixon personality , whose spirit infused and transcend ? ed the grosser aspects of partisanship . The campaign was hardly more than a few days old when the Wall Street . Journal cited , as an example of his " political craftsmanship , " the fact that Nixon had " carefully set out to undo Democratic attempts to pic ? ture him as just a party hatchet man , and to appear be ? fore the voters as a man of Presidential timber . " Nixon had fortified himself for the ordeal . Five days before the Terrace Dining Room pep-talk , he had se ? cluded himself in a room at the Mayflower Hotel . There with pencil and pad , he outlined , revised and laborious ? ly , brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic speech . " " He just climbed into his pajamas and thought and thought and wrote and wrote , " one of his press secre ? taries told Richard Rovere . " He does n't want ghost ? writers . Oh , we help with research , and we give him ideas now and then , and sometimes we throw in a phrase or a sentence we think might be helpful . But it all goes through that meat-grinder of a mind he 's got , and believe me , it comes out an entirely different grade of hamburger . He has his own vocabulary and his own rhythms , and none of us can really catch them . And he 'll never use anything that does n't sound like him . " Theme of the Campaign What came out of the meat-grinder was , in essence , a slogan joined with a name : " Eisenhower ; peace , pros ? perity , progress . " It was a text liberally sprinkled with eulogies to " the greatest leader of the atomic age , " " a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation , " " a man of destiny , both at home and abroad . " It reached a climax urging every American to rise above the petty squabbles of partisanship : " And finally may I tell you , as you go out and work in this campaign to keep name of state in the Eisenhower column , you are working for an Administration that has brought peace and pros ? perity and progress to America and you are going to be working for a man whom every American can proudly hold up to his children as one who has faith in God , faith in America , and one who has restored dignity and respect to the highest office in the land . " On the first leg of his tour , from Washington to Southern California and the Pacific Northwest , Nixon 's guest for votes fell into a smooth-running pattern . At the first stop after the President 's send-off , in Indianap ? olis , he promised to stick to the high road , but warned the Democrats not to get rough . " Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where our opponents mis ? represent and distort the record and where they vilify the President of the United States , I shall consider it a duty and a privilege to set the record straight . " The rest was oratorical window dressing . By the time he hit Oregon , Nixon had so polished the basic speech that he could deliver it backward . It was a subdued , mellow performance , with just enough nips at the Truman policies to stir up the crowd but none like his snide 195z assurance that " nothing would please the Kremlin more " than Stevenson 's election . At each airport Nixon walked down the ramp from his DC-6B with his arm around wife Pat , for a greeting from a beribboned delegation of ranking Republicans in the vicinity . Then off in a motorcade to the rally . The speech drew good crowds and seemed to go over , al ? though to be sure the audiences were to a large extent claques of the faithful who needed no persuasion . From city to city and state to state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the phraseology grew shopworn with repetition , the correspondents coined their own titles for the familiar cliches . " The Old Shoe " was his statement that the United States " has prosperity and peace to boot " ; the " Weight-Lifting Act , " his line that " every man can hold up Dwight Eisenhower to his children as a man who has faith in God , faith in America " ; and the " Bush-Leaguer " iden ? tified his assertion that " Adlai Stevenson just is n't in the same league with President Eisenhower . " A correspondent who accompanied the Vice President on both 1956 campaign swings admitted that , listening to him day after day , a preconceived dislike had been intensified . " There was something completely synthetic about Nixon 's appearances , " he said . " He never debated the issues , simply brushed them off with slogans and cliches . After a while you only felt him saying to him ? self : ' How can I make this crowd like me ? ' Granting that all politicians want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him look bad . " On this as on other trips , both Nixons worked with tireless intensity . Their chartered airliner had been fitted with a beaverboard compartment at the rear where they could have privacy ? reading , or napping or writing without interruption . For Nixon , one of the advantages of plane travel was that , with every seat booked , there was no room for that self-invited pest , the local political ? cian who might want to hitch a ride to the next stop . Toward the end of the trip Nixon did shift to a train part of the time and he made no secret of his distaste for the company of these political hangovers of the whistle-stopping era . When a reporter asked whether he pre ? ferred planes or trains , he answered : " Planes of course ; more privacy , and you can get more work done . " Normally his tours booked every hour of every day solidly . On one occasion in California there was an en ? forced layover of several hours , and a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took advantage of the break to go for a swim in the hotel pool . Suddenly , in the midst of the laughter and horseplay , Nixon in his bathing suit stalked into the patio , dove in , swam the length of the pool several times , climbed out and dis ? appeared in the direction of his room . All this without so much as a glance right or left or a word or a smile to anyone in the party . For Mrs. Nixon , as for her husband , every thought was dedicated to the campaign . On one occasion in Cheyenne , Nixon was suffering from a virus attack and the speech was an ordeal ; words came with difficulty , his face was ashen and he fought for control . Later , as the party boarded a midnight plane , a correspondent standing beside Mrs. Nixon expressed sympathy for the Vice President 's having to carry on at such a cost . " Oh , " she exclaimed defensively , " but it was a good speech ! " Outwardly , whatever her private feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Vice President 's preoccupation with the pounding rhythms of the campaign was being inter ? rupted by raucous protests from Republican headquar ? ters in Washington . Willard Edwards reported in The Chicago Tribune , after private conversations with Nix ? on in his flying office , that the party high command had begun sending messages begging him frantically to slug it out with Stevenson and deploring the lofty level at which he had been operating . In response to their ad ? vice to " engage in verbal street-fighting , slashing , rip ? ping and swinging from his heels , " the Vice President let it be known that he had no intention of becoming a " political Jack-the-Ripper . " To verify the report , Edwards telephoned Washing ? ton at a stop on the tour and confirmed , not only that Nixon was running his own show , but that panicky Republican leaders were imploring him to assume again the role of hatchet man . " He 's paying us no attention , " a high Republican official growled . " He 's got his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on the crank . " What had stirred the party high command to a sense of panic were the private polls indicating an easy victory for Eisenhower and Nixon , but a depressing outlook for House and Senate candidates in many areas . Nixon ad ? mitted that , in probing for " soft spots , " he had found many ; but to him the cold fact of politics was therefore bipartisan in those states where voter regis ? tration showed the Republicans to be outnumbered ; and the tactics that he had favored in earlier years were no longer appropriate . Nixon worked subtly and persistently to divide the Democratic Party against itself . One of his popular ar ? guments at closed meetings of party workers was that UAW President Walter Reuther , whom he called the " smartest labor leader in America , " was the " man to beat " in November rather than Stevenson . After he had exploited the possibilities of this line privately , he ar ? ranged that a Michigan reporter should hear one of his briefings . The result was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cleverness " and suggested that the UAW leader sat at the center of a nationwide spider-web , the " source of the big money and organiz ? ers " capable of winning for the Democratic Party . At the other extreme , he went so far in a Milwaukee news conference as to make backhanded amends for his controversial 1952 allusion to Truman as a " traitor to the high principles " of the Democratic Party . Explain ? ing the charge , Nixon said : " I believe that in the Demo ? cratic Party there is a great cleavage between the great principles on which the Democratic Party was founded ? Jefferson and Jackson , principles which recognize the dignity of the individual , the sovereignty of the states ? and the new theory which some of those who are now quite influential in the Democratic Party hold to , that the answer to most problems is through federal govern ? ment action . I think that when Mr. Truman and Mr. Stevenson and others went along with this new theory rather than the one that is traditionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believe they left millions of Democrats without a home . In other words , I believe that they deserted their party rather than the party deserting them . " The stratagem may have been well conceived , but if it paid off the evidence was scanty . In fact , it was a question how much or whether the final outcome was THE NEW REPUBLIC affected at all by the selfless foot-pounds of energy and devotion he poured into the struggle . On the whole it was a tepid campaign because there was no fundamental or vital issue dividing the country that year . During October the campaign was enlivened , if only sporadi ? cally , by Adlai Stevenson 's proposal to suspend nuclear bomb testing ; but the fallout danger had not yet been recognized for what it was , and the public was not ready for the proposal . By and large the test ban never became an issue . Eisenhower , having perhaps some prescience that the proposal contained its own built-in logic , treated the subject gingerly . Nixon began with similar caution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sub ? ject progressively when he found audiences responsive . At Philadelphia October 3 he called the test ban pro ? posal " extraordinary ? appalling ? catastrophic non ? sense ? the height of irresponsibility ? na ? ve ? the most dangerous theme of the campaign . " By October 17 at Buffalo he was accusing Stevenson of " playing danger ? ous politics with American security , " and referring to " the ridiculous H-bomb proposal " as a " major political error " on Stevenson 's part . Yielding Not to Temptation Except for that indiscretion , Nixon 's new personality was proof against all temptation . When Congressman Dewey Short , introducing him at a rally , assured Nixon : " You 're among friends ? take off your gloves and sock them , " the Vice President could only pretend not to - hear . In Ohio , where GOP workers openly deplored his mellow mood , he was challenged directly to defend his " high-level " campaign . For the first time , publicly at any rate , he deserted the Chotiner fear-and-scare psychology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The problem this year is different from that in 1952 . I always conduct a hard-hitting cam ? paign on issues , and avoid personalities . In 1952. we were giving the people reasons to throw out a group , and now we are giving them reasons to keep an Admin ? istration in . What I am doing now is to appeal to swing voters , whom we must have to win . It is essential to have a type of campaign persuasive to independents and Democrats . " Nixon 's first cross-country swing was followed by a second , and simultaneously by a burst of energy on Eisenhower 's part . Their theme remained the same ? that the American people had never been happier or more prosperous . They refused to grapple with the possibility that the world had achieved , not peace , but an uneasy truce . As the campaign drew to a close Nixon was saying " our opponents are having great difficulty finding issues . " Actually he was on the defensive , painting a syn ? thetic state of euphoria and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention Agriculture Secretary Ezra Taft Benson , farm parity prices or flexible price supports . At Cornell University , where a group of college editors hammered hard at suggestions that there was inconsistency between his voting record and his current campaign speeches , he answered in platitudes . On . McCarthyism , when asked if he favored a resump ? tion of Senate probing , he could only insist the Eisen ? hower Administration had taken the security issue out of politics . It was Nixon 's good fortune that the public was as little interested in the issues as he was in discussing them . His appeal continued to be essentially emotional or evangelistic . He avoided mention of the Republican platform or the program the party would put forward if elected . His argument from beginning to end was that President Eisenhower was the greatest man alive and should be re-elected to assure continued peace , prosperity and progress . It was not a thesis to set the countryside afire , but Nixon was no longer a firebrand . His was a more modest role . A newsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1956 campaign . Questioning a staffer , he pried out an admission that Nixon had explicitly vetoed use of Cadillacs or other big cars in his motorcades ! In the upshot , it was an easy Eisenhower victory . The margin was more than nine million popular votes : 35,590,472 for Eisenhower ; 26,029,752 for Stevenson . But the fears of party professionals had been well grounded . The Democrats held their control in the Senate , 49 to 47 ; and picked up another two seats in the House . Thus , notwithstanding a Presidential sweep of landslide proportions , the Republican Party could not win at the state and district level . It had tried the hard sell without success in ' 54 , and it had no better results in ' 56 using both a soft sell and the Eisenhower magic . From the Vice President 's point of view , looking ahead to 1960 , the returns were ambiguous .
