Some 12,000 stockholders gathered in a Bronx armory last week for the annual meeting of American Telephone &; Telegraph Co. , by far the biggest such meeting in history . Previous record : 4,700 at Standard Oil ( N.J. ) meeting last year . The big drawing card : a vote on the proposed three-for-one stock split . On hand to keep the proceedings moving smoothly were 250 ushers and hostesses , plus a catering staff of 200 that served box lunches ( ham , beef and nut-bread sandwiches , cottage cheese salad , frozen peaches and cake ) . <P> Although some stockholders arrived in chauffeured limousines , the great majority , as in past years , trudged up from the subway stops . In the crowd were retired couples and young marrieds , vacationers and a greying , modestly dressed Boston woman who took three days ' work leave ( " I got such a kick out of the Standard Oil meeting last year that I had to attend this " ) . A young matron explained : " I 'm between leaving my job and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I may have it here . " An attractive , late-fortyish widow confided to a neighbor beside her : " My first two husbands left me 240 shares . I hope to do better the next time . " <P> Behind the carnival atmosphere was a sober desire by the world 's most widely held corporation ( 1,629,607 stockholders ) to call more attention to its growing markets and profits in the highly competitive scramble for investment capital . After the split was announced last December , the stock started up from 202 , opened at 250 the day the stockholders met . The stockholders overwhelmingly approved the split ; the stock jumped to 263 ? . Answering a question from the floor , President Frederick R. Kappel said A. T. &; T. has $1.2 billion on hand for expansion , plans no major financing right away .
