" The time has come when more &; more women must go into business . . . The manpower barrel has been scraped clean . . . Let the men laugh at woman 's intuition if they will ... If your husband owns a business or owns a factory , YOU learn how to run it . " <P> In the Starlight Roof of Manhattan 's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel last week , Cinemactress Ginger Rogers chirped out this call to American women . It was the 56th annual convention of the National Association of Manufacturers . The presence of Ginger Rogers , addressing a room jam-packed with delegates ' wives ( and a few furtive men ) , was n't the only new thing about this year 's N.A.M . convention . Also present were 296 top industrialists brought by ECA from 18 foreign countries . <P> Plain Talk . N.A.M . members helped show them some production tricks on a nationwide tour of U.S. industry . Last week the time had come for some frank talk . Up to a conference platform stepped ex-ECA Boss Paul G. Hoffman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with European industry , said Hoffman , is that productivity is too low and competition is hamstrung . Hoffman said that the U.S. does n't want to tell Europe how to run its business , but if Europe wants to step up its output , perhaps it " should abandon the highly civilized competition that prevails in most of your countries in favor of the very uncomfortable form of competition that we have . . . The degree of your shift will determine the extent of your improvement . " <P> The N.A.M . turned its attention to domestic problems , heard a forthright attack by Price Boss Mike Di Salle on N.A.M . policies . Even though he knew NA.M . ' s arguments against price controls , e.g. , free competition is more effective than Government meddling , Di Salle did n't think they stood up . Besides , said he : " I am not convinced that spokesmen for the N.A.M . speak for the majority of American businessmen . " U.S. Chamber of Commerce Economist Emerson P. Schmidt fired back . Said he : " OPS has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all conscience should not grab credit for below-ceiling prices . " Schmidt thought that controls have been a failure . <P> Plain Talker . But no one was truer to the image of the ruggedly free businessman N.A.M . likes to see than its new president , William J. Grede ( rhymes with Brady ) , 54 , boss of Milwaukee 's Grede Foundries , Inc . Elected to replay William H. Ruffin , president of Durham , N.C. 's Erwin Mills , Inc. , Bill Grede describes himself as a " foundry man or sand rat , as we call it . " By selling pots &; pans , he worked his way through two years at the University of Wisconsin , then quit to invest in a small foundry . Ever since , he has been running his own business , and now has 1,100 employees . Grede has refused to bargain collectively , and has no union contracts . He has licked the C.I.O. steel workers in strikes , or has headed off organizers by wage boosts , pensions , vacations and pay scales at the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual judgment makes for a static economy . To the extent unions do this , they 're bad . "
