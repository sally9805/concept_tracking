It was a bitter medicine that Wisconsin 's Republican state convention forced on aging ( 72 ) Republican Senator Alexander Wiley last May when it voted to support another candidate in the U.S. Senate primary . The G.O.P organization diagnosed Wiley 's political illness as an acute case of globalitis-for Wiley , as ranking Republican on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , had doggedly supported President Eisenhower 's internationalist policies . The prescription was a ruthless purge , and the man nominated to bring it off in the primaries was Glen R. Davis , 41 , a handsome , smooth-talking fifth-term Congressman who believes in the Bricker amendment and in tapering off on foreign aid . Old Alex Wiley left the convention in tears ( TIME , June 4 ) , but he stubbornly decided to run anyway . <P> Wiley turned on a vigorous campaign , handing out his card to people in the streets , flattering the ladies . Once , at the Leyse Aluminum Co. plant in Kewaunee , he genially seized a labor union leader , waltzed him around the floor , singing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as factory workers chimed in with " Ja , ja , ja , ja . " Davis , meanwhile , turned on an equally dynamic but better-financed campaign , got in his share of the stop-and-shake technique . <P> When the ballots were counted last week , Alexander Wiley was the winner , thanks principally to a heavy 20,000-vote lead in normally Democratic Milwaukee County . Total vote : Wiley 217,402 ; Davis 207,693 . Wiley had had a close call . Of the 445,625 G.O.P. votes , Wiley 's slim margin was only 10,000 . A third Republican , Howard H. Boyle Jr. , 35-who ran on an anti-Eisenhower platform-got 20,000 that might otherwise have gone to Davis . Nonetheless , Wiley should have no trouble in November against Democratic Nominee Henry W. Maier , 38 , a state senator , who cashed in 163,336 votes in the Democratic primary that brought out a surprising 240,213 voters .
