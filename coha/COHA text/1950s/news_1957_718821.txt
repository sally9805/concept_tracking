txt One of the nation 's business leaders asserted today that there were " waste " and " false reasoning " in the defense program . He cited the Pentagon , some business interests and , by indirection , the Administration . Ralph J. Cordiner , president of the General Electric Company , reflected his disappointment over the failure of the Administration to act on recommendations of his Defense Department committee about compensation for members of the armed forces . The committee , after a study of more than a year , rekommended ten days ago that sweeping changes be made in the methods and rates of pay for skilled civilians working for the armed forces and skilled uniformed personnel . However , a plan to adopt most of the proposals was rejected by the Budget Bureau as not being opportune . Pentagon Aides Present Mr. Cordiner was the chief speaker at an Armed Forces Day dinner that was attended by several high Pentagon officials . His speech covered many aspects of the nation 's military structure that he found faulty . His assessment bore additional significance in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently he had been " sounded out " as a possible successor to Charles E. Wilson , Secretary of Defense . He was found to be " not available . " Secretary Wilson is expected to leave the Cabinet some time this summer . Mr. Cordiner modified his indictment of the Pentagon by citing the handicaps of existing legislation . He also praised the armed forces Congressional committees , under the chairmanship of Senator Richard B. Russell and Representative Carl Vinson , both Georgia Democrats ; Secretary Wilson , and the Chiefs of Staff . Except for Secretary Wilson , he mentioned no Administration . eaders by name . Mr. Cordiner cited the " shock.ng rate " at which skilled enisted men and officers were caving the services and said : " It is an alarming fact that 37 per cent of the people with lese electronic and other techlical skills  --  the skills that : ount most in a technically ad  --  anced form of defense  --  are caving the armed forces as fast as they can , for the greater incentives of civilian life . " Four thousand pilots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , representing a trainIn loss alone of $480,000,000 . This meant , he . suggested , that the taxpayers ' money was " essentially wasted " and that the combat readiness of the United .. States was weakened by expensive training of replacements . ? " We now have the immensely wasteful expense of half a million men and billions of dollars worth of equipment tied up in repetitive training , " he continued . Mr. Cordiner reiterated the proposals he had made for a pay ' system based on skills to supplant the " Methuselah " system based on seniority . And he asserted again that adoption of his - plan would save $5,000,000,000 a year by the fiscal year 1962 or produce a 15 per cent improvement in combat capability . " The challenge to stay ahead of a potential aggressor means ' Staying ahead in quality of men As well as equipment , " he de-clared . " The public has apparently assumed that advance ' Weapons alone will produce an adequate defense and deterrent to war . This is not true . " Turning to the problems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $40,000,000,000 this year with the added defense support programs , Mr. Cordiner emphasized the following three points : 1 . Although necessary , defense expenditures are a loss and not a contribution to the national economy . He rejected as " false reasoning " the argument that defense expenditures are a necessary factor in prosperity . 2 . Forty billion dollars is so much money to take from the taxpayers that every responsible person must perpetually feel under obligation to save some of it and reduce the tax burden . 2 . Inflation caused by defense spending obliges the people to pay twice for their national defense . But the problem of obtaining full value for defense spending , gvIr . Cordiner emphasized , is " not as simple as the problems ' of obtaining economy in private business that is subject to the daily discipline of the marketplace . " Thus , Mr. Cordiner referred to criticisms that have been made by business and taxpayer groups . Turning to the role of government , Mr. Cordiner urged the nation to " resist the temptation to play politics with defense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts to companies in " so-called ' depressed areas ' " in order " temporarily to keep the voters happy in a community . " He noted also a " political temptation " to place defense contracts with failing companies " in order to cater to particular communities whose votes are needed by the party in power . " He called attention to " another familiar temptation " to overstate the concentration of defense business in companies eAvith outstanding research and production facilities . With the Defense Department 's task hard enough as it is , Mr , Cordiner went on , " the additional confusion of political demagoguery is a luxury this country can not afford . " " We thust accelerate our progress in long-range planning if the defense program is to be purposefully managed , " said Mr. Cordiner , in an apparent reference to his own proposals for utilizing manpower . He said " everyone in a position of responsibility must minimize the natural tendency to allow his judgment to be swayed by short-term political considerations that have little or nothing to do with the defense problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
