Artist Diego Rivera , the persistent but bumbling Communist who was recently readmitted to the party after 26 years in the outer lightness ( TIME , Oct. 11 ) , last week sent his international masters a hand-painted valentine for Christmas . <P> Rivera , who too often zigged when the party zagged , was so pleased with his pardon that he worked on a huge ( 8 ft. by 16 ft. ) canvas , depicting-according to the Gospel of St. Marx-last year 's liberation of neighboring Guatemala by General Carlos Castillo Armas ( see cut ) . <P> The picture , one of the most fanciful and macabre of all of Rivera 's heavy-handed propaganda paintings , shows a servile , rat-faced Castillo Armas shaking hands with U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles . Castillo Armas bows low ; at his belt is an automatic pistol , and in his jacket pocket a thick packet of $10,000 bills . Secretary Dulles , in a battered felt hat and paratrooper 's uniform , grips with one hand Rivera 's idea of an H-bomb . On the bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the secretary 's ear is his brother , Allen Dulles , head of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency . Between Dulles and Castillo Armas , U.S. Ambassador John Peurifoy ( now envoy to Thailand ) passes out greenbacks to eager Guatemalan soldiers . As presumably downtrodden workers load a banana boat , and the battered corpses of little children lie unnoticed underfoot , Archbishop Verolino , the papal nuncio , blesses the joyous scene . <P> With none of his old flair for publicity , Good Communist Rivera quietly prepared to pack off the finished canvas as a token of his zeal to " a certain country . " Though Rivera refused to be more specific , he did not deny that the certain country was the Soviet Union . <P> Communist Artist David Alfaro Siqueiros also found a logical Marxist solution for his problems last week . Since the government was buying art for a projected modern museum , said Siqueiros , why not let artists pay their income taxes with their work instead of their money ? When the Finance Minister okayed the proposal , Rivera was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But anti-Communist Rufino Tamayo , whose work is selling like hot cakes , said haughtily : " I prefer to pay my taxes in cash . I have no paintings to spare . "
