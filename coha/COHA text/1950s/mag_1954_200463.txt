After looking at the 28-minute television film , Operation Ivy , last week , the U.S. public could hardly be blamed for feeling that it had been given too slight a review of the first full-scale thermonuclear explosion and too much of sonorous background music , theatrical hokum and bureaucratic lens-hogging . The film , released 17 months after the event ( just in time to heighten world apprehension abroad over last month 's two bigger explosions ) , was subject to massive and at times confusing cutting in the name of security . But even so , it might , as some of its scenes dramatically demonstrated , have remained what it deserved to be-a simple record of a soul-shaking and historic event . <P> In its best moments , Operation Ivy gave the viewer a fascinating look into the curious world of atom experimentation . It showed the flat , coral islands of Eniwetok , the test tower rising above the surrounding sea . and , in views of vast test devices , evidence of the enormous toil and expense necessary to prepare for the explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mushroom cloud rising through menacing black skies like a great , poisonous-looking gob of whipped cream . <P> Sugar-Coating . But the Government ( the film was shot by the Air Force , reviewed by the Atomic Energy Commission , and released by the Federal Civil Defense Administration ) was unable to resist sugarcoating . The finished product was all too worthy of the street from which it sprang-the address of the USAF laboratory , as the film publicity releases proudly state , is 8935 Wonderland Ave. , Hollywood 46 , Calif . <P> Instead of using a behind-the-scenes voice for narration , the producers of Operation Ivy employed Television Actor Reed Hadley , star of Public Defender and Racket Squad , to saunter through the picture in khaki uniform , lighting his pipe , leaning negligently against bulkheads , and standing against the tropic sky . Actor Hadley ( who was whisked secretly to the Pacific in 1952 and who was not allowed to let even his wife know where he had been until last week ) could hardly be blamed for doing his conscientious best in the role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was devoted to the dull and time-filling task of identifying various dignitaries who stood , embarrassed but proud , before the camera for their due share of glory . <P> Outmoded Art . One look at the explosion indicated that civilian defense must be rapidly becoming an outmoded art . But the last few minutes of the film was devoted to a talk by Civil Defense Administrator Val Peterson , who sat at his desk and emitted such platitudes as " What you have just seen . . . affects the safety of our communities and the well-being of our homes and our families . " He asked for preparation at home to guarantee " assurance that the American people are prepared to withstand any assault . " This , " he added , with bitter , unconscious humor , " is no simple thing to do . " <P> By some miracle of restraint , none of the participants in this macabre soap opera claimed that the bomb made marvelous underwater suds.                   @ @
