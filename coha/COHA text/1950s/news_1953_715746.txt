txt An official of the Yonkers Raceway testified yesterday that $6 , - 000,000 in potential mutuel bets was " lost " by the track within a three-year period owing to the slowness and inefficiency of clerks hired at the instigation of Thomas F. Lewis , the labor union leader who was slain on Aug. 28 . Fred S. Buck , assistant to the president of Yonkers Raceway , told the State Harness Racing Commission , which is looking into the operations of the track , that the state lost $400,000 and the raceway lost $500,000 in revenue because the employes operating the pari-mutuel machines were unable to take in the waiting bets . Mr. Buck and Nathan Herzfeld , general manager of Algam Corporation , owners of the track , were questioned for three hours behind closed doors as the commission 's hearings at the State Office Building , 80 Centre Street , went into their second day , and then were recessed until next Friday . Protection ' Is Denied After the session the commission released a statement denying charges that it had been withholding information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the statement said , " has not attempted to withhold information on the investigation from the public . It states as emphatically as it can that no one is being protected and that the evidence as it evolves will be given to the press with no attempt whatsoever at censorship . " The commission abhors the insinuation made in some quarters that it is ' guarding secrets of the underworld . ' This is not true . The commission is interested only in the facts and will take the strongest action deemed necessary to wipe out criminal or illegal acts when they are ascertained . " - The commission , which released only a meager account of yesterday 's questioning , made it known , however , that the revelation of // hiring practices at the track involving heavy payments to " trouble-shooting " labor consultants had come as a " surprise " to its members . Henry M. James , chairman , and Commissioner Hamilton S. Gaddis of Malverne , L. I. , expressed bewilderment at the facts ' uncovered by the inquiry . Mr. Gaddis said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " conditions would not have been improved because payments of $164,000 to $167,500 to labor consultants over a three-and-a-half year period had not appeared on the Raceway 's payroll . But , he added , the commission intends to correct the situation . Hired Labor Pacifiers The track hired trouble-shooters to keep peace with Local 32-E of the Building Service Employes International Union , A. F. L. , of which Mr. Lewis was president . The local , having a union shop contract , supplied between 800 and 1,000 clerks for each race meeting . The current inquiry was touched off by Mr. Lewis ' slaying . His killer was shot dead by a policeman and another suspect was indicted Thursday on a first-degree murder charge . Mr. Herzfeld testified that Joseph Pizzo , , who received fees totaling $65,000 , and Charles Johnson , who was paid $37,500 , both as labor relations consultants , , were hired at the direction of Mr : Lewis , d that the two men were instruental in ending a strike of construction workers in. 1950 . The results of the three-hour questioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - James , who earlier had defended himself against press attacks for conducting the hearings in secret . When reporters objected that the brief statements could not possibly cover all three hours of the hearing , Mr. James replied that the release covered the hearing " fully and truthfully . " For a half hour the reiliters pressed Mr. James for an explanation of why they were barred from the ' hearings and thus prevented from making their own determination of what was newsworthy . Mr. James , a former Hudson , N. Y. , editor and publisher , failed to explain to their satisfaction why they had to accept " canned releases . " May Revise Its Set-Up The three-man commission , of which one member has been absent from the hearings , serves without salary by appointment of the Governor , Mr. James said they met once a month and maintained telephone contact at other times . He , added that the commission 's Albany office was staffed by a secretary , stenographer and a clerk . He said " something else " would have to be done if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said that the tax returns of five persons who had shared in the trouble-shooting payments would be examined . The Westchester County District Attorney , Samuel Faile , was reported to be in close touch with the commission with a view to possible extortion and blackmail prosecutions . Mr. James said that when the hearings resumed the commission would have completed studies of the books of the trotting association and the track owners He indicated that the press might be admitt ? d to future hearings .
