txt The Federal Reserve Board proposed legislation to overhaul its powers to change the reserve requirements of member commercial banks , that is , the percentage of their customers ' deposits banks are required to keep in cash in Federal Reserve banks . Under the recommendations , Introduced in bills by Sen. Fulbright ( D. , Ark. ) and Rep. Spence , ( D. , Ky. ) the F.R.B. could : Let member banks count all or part of the cash they keep in their vaults in their required reserves . Set the reserve requirements for central reserve city banks  --  the largest class of member batiks  --  within a range of 10% to 20% of their demand deposits Instead of the present 13% to 28% . Present reserve requirements for the other two classifications of banks ? reserve city banks , and " country " banks ? would not be affected as such under the proposed bill . Those statutory requirements now range from 10% to 20% for reserve city banks , and from 7% to 15% for " country " banks . Requirements are now set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 17% for reserve city banks and liq for country banks Also unaffected by the proposal are legal reserve requirements on time deposits , including savings , now set at 5% . The present legal range is 3% to 6% . Allowing the inclusion of vault cash in reserve requirements would lower the amount of reserves banks must keep in ? cash at Federal Reserve banks  --  particularly in the case of reserve city and country banks , whose holdings of vault cash are relatively larger than those of central reserve city banks . Therefore , the Board said it was proposing no change in the statutory range of reserve requirements for reserve city and " country " banks . Gradual Change The Board estimated that banks over the country have more than 52 billion of cash on hand But it stressed that rather than permit all of this money to be counted at once toward eserve requirements , it would put this change . into effect gradually , accompanying the moves ov - offsetting adjustments in reserve requirement percentages . " Though the Board is proposing that the range of requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10%-to-20 , , ; - as that for reserve city bank &; it emphasized It would still retain authority for keeping three classes of banks and of setting different reserve requirements within each class . The Board observed , however , that bringing the requirement ranges closer together " would tend to encourage harrower differentials as between classes of banks . " . The Federal Reserve Board 's proposal followed by . two days the House Banking Committee 's " approval of provision in the SenateapproVed Financial Institutions Act to do away with the central reserve city classification Under that proposal , the requirement ratio set for reserve city banks would also apply to banks which are now central reserve city banks . Under the Board 's legislation , however . a differential could still be kept between the top two classes of banks . The Federal Reserve Board said the proposed legislation " would permit moving gradally toward a more equitable xild ra.tional structure of reserve requirements , and toward making , in the course of time , any changes in the level of reserve requirements consistent with appropriate monetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet the monetary and credit needs of a growing economy . " Still another Federal Reserve proposal would let small banks within central reserve or reserve cities carry lower required reserves than those specified for other banks in those classifications . This is , in effect , a relief clause aimed at helping , say , the small neighborhood bank which might find it a strain to carry the larger reserves required of banks in its area . The Board noted that under present law , member banks in outlying districts of central reserve or reserve cities can be permitted to carry lower : requirements . New York and Chicago have long been central reserve cities , but member banks in some districts in those cities , such as outside New York 's Lower Manhattan and the Chicago Loop may be allowed to maintain reserve city and even country bank reserve requirements . More Rational Criteria " The amendment proposed , " the F.R.B. declared , " would permit adoption of more rational criteria for exempting individual banks than can be used under existing law and thereby make possible elimination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go as far as those sought by the American Bankers Association . While the A.B.A. urged that vault cash be included in required reserves , it also wanted a flat 10% reserve requireivent for all classes of banks . Under the F.R.B. proposals it ' would be possible to set reserve requirements at 10% for all member banks . The Congressional outlook on the proposals is uncertain at the moment with both House and Senate Banking Committees tied up with other matters . One lawmaker predicted lengthy hearings would be called due to the " fundamental changes " involved and that Congress would n't get around to acting until next session .
