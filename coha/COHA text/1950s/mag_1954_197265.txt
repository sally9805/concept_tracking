Luis Taruc , for eight years the head of the bloody Communist Huk revolt in the Philippine hills , strode into Manila 's packed City Hall last week to be tried for rebellion and a string of other crimes including arson , murder , kidnaping and robbery . The defense asked the court to drop seven of the 30 counts against him on the ground that a 1948 presidential amnesty absolved these crimes . The prosecution agreed , even though the seventh count-involving the ambush murder of Aurora Quezon , widow of the onetime President-was committed a full year after the amnesty had been granted . Thereupon Taruc 's three lawyers waived formal reading of the complaint and Taruc pleaded : " Guilty , Your Honor . " <P> Though he had just acknowledged crimes punishable by death , Taruc appeared unworried as he read a 20-minute statement : " I represent the feelings and sentiments of thousands of militant peasants compelled to take up arms since 1946 as a last resort to defend ourselves against calculated persecutions . " Then he went on to attack his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a criminal adventurist policy of armed seizure of power through national uprising . " He even praised the " U.S. Government and farsighted Filipino leaders who boldly decided to seize the initiative by compelling reform , " and saluted President Ramon Magsaysay 's " bold new program . " He patted the West on the back : " The democratic camp in general , faced by the atomic age and the critical world situation . has come to realize that the only way to stop the advance of Communism is to sincerely and determinedly make complete restitution and amends for past undemocratic commissions . " <P> Whether this doubletalk meant that Taruc was a changed ( though unrepentant ) man or was simply proclaiming a new tactical retreat of the party was hard to determine from his speech . The one-time Huk leader never once referred to his surrender ( TIME , May 24 ) , instead preferred to say that he " came down " to Manila . It was plain that the Magsaysay government was happy to have him in its hands instead of on its hands : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is also costly . <P> Significantly , the government did not ask the death sentence for Prize Prisoner Taruc , instead demanded life imprisonment .
