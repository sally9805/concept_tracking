From St. Petersburg , Fla. ( where he canceled his booking at the Tides Hotel because it discriminates against Jews ) to Philadelphia , Pa. ( where he avoided the Warwick Hotel because of a labor dispute ) , Vice President Nixon moved across the eastern half of the U.S. last week in the home stretch of his 15,000-mile tour . He scolded an ardent Republican lady who asked questions about Adlai Stevenson 's divorce ( " I think that any personal life of a candidate should not be a proper political issue " ) . He sidestepped the political credits and debits of the World Series ( " I lean to the Dodgers , but my wife is a Yankee fan " ) . He pointedly omitted to invite Wisconsin 's Senator Joe McCarthy to the speakers ' stand at Milwaukee 's Marquette University , not even mentioning his name . Along Nixon 's way in Milwaukee a placard proclaimed : LOCK UP <P> EVERYTHING - TRICKY DICK 'S IN TOWN , but the increasing size and attentiveness of the crowds and the unfailing moderation of the candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past . <P> As Nixon burgeoned as a distinct G.OP. asset , he began more and more to take on Adlai Stevenson in debate ( effectively overlooking Opposite Number Estes Kefauver ) . " You find corruption in either party , " ran the tenor of his argument , " but we clean it up . " And again , " Both the parties want to be good to our people , but we start with the individual and work up ; they start with the Government and work down . " In Philadelphia , Nixon termed Stevenson 's stop-the-H-bomb-tests proposal " catastrophic nonsense . " In Syracuse , N.Y. , he jabbed at the " special-interests " tone of the Democratic campaign . " Anyone who tries to divide the American people on a class basis is guilty of the most wicked nonsense . " <P> At week 's end the Vice President returned to Washington , reported to the President on the mood of the U.S. as he had found it ( they like Ike ) , on his own behind-the-scenes prodding of some lax and lagging G.O.P. precinct-level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help some edgy states , e.g. , California . The same night Nixon staged a nationwide TV press conference , a bright stunt that ranged eight newsmen against him in eight U.S. cities by remote TV pickups . He distressed professional newsmen because he turned the questions into take-off points for snippets of campaign speeches , but he nonetheless put on the most vigorous and impressive national political performance of his career . <P> It was fast becoming evident to Republicans ( local candidates in increasing numbers were calling for his help ) and Democrats alike that Dick Nixon is taking most of the tricks in the political game that had him typed by the Democrats as 1956 's Public Villain No. 1 .
