THE governor of Arkansas is an aggressive , ambitious and photogenic young war hero named Sidney Sanders McMath , who has been running for office ever since he was knee-high to a razorback hog . So far , he has n't lost an election since he first emerged , in overalls and cotton shirt , as a man of destiny in the campaign for the presidency of the freshman class at Hot Springs High School " Sidney , " remarked Mrs. Hester Stall , who presided over the civics class , " you are becoming quite a politician . I wonder if I could manage your campaign when you run for the presidency of the United States ? " There was a twinkle in Mrs. Stall 's eye , but she did n't get a laugh out of Sid . " Well , ma'am , " he answered , " I figure a fellow would have to be governor first . " " That 's too bad , " scoffed Mrs. Stall . " Everybody in this class knows the Democrats wo n't let a governor of Arkansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 've heard that , " Sid replied earnestly , " but I figure that they might change their minds if a fellow really put Arkansas on the map . " At this point , Mrs. Stall decided it was time to end the fun and get the class back to the day 's lesson , but in later years she frequently recalled that conversation and wondered who was kidding whom . It is now a matter of record that Freshman McMath was n't kidding anybody . At a tender age , he was merely upholding that section of the politician 's unwritten code which provides that an untried candidate should be coy but available . McMath has not only been charging breathlessly into politics since boyhood but is , at the age of thirty-seven , fantastically endowed with all the time-tested background trappings that political orators have successfully hawked to the American voter since Abe Lincoln ruined his eyes reading Pilgrim 's Progress by firelight . McMath was , with almost insufferable foresight , born in a log cabin . He earned his first money picking cotton at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bolster the family finances and worked his way through college washing dishes . As if this were not enough , he won promotion in the field for heroic action during the war in the South Pacific and came back to slay a notorious , albeit somewhat doddering dragon in his own home town by smashing the $30,000,000-a-year Hot Springs gambling and political racket . These high lights from a publicity agent 's dream might well seem to have been as luckily accidental as was McMath 's birthplace . But the truth is that he planned far in advance and executed with a kind of unrelenting righteousness almost every step leading to the office of the governor . When he was in law school at the University of Arkansas , for instance , the McMath plan for advancing the political welfare of its author was already so firmly established that it influenced his extracurricular activities . On one occasion at college he was offered a chance to earn ten dollars by fighting four rounds at . Fort Smith with a professional boxer known as The Woodchopper . Although he had been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he could n't last four rounds against a professional . On the other hand , he needed the ten dollars . With his roommate , Clyde Brown , who is now a district judge , he sat down and solemnly weighed the advantages of cold cash against the disadvantages of a cauliflower ear or a broken nose on the face of an ambitious young politician . The ten-dollar bill won . They borrowed an old sedan and drove to Fort Smith , where Sid climbed into the ring with a prayer and a plan . " If I do n't get him in the first round , " he told Brown , " he 'll murder me later . " This appeared to be the height of optimism when the pro started off by clipping him on the side of the head hard enough to put him on the canvas , but be got up at the count of eight and risked everything on one desperate blow at his now careless opponent 's stomach . It turned out to be a good risk and The Woodchopper was counted out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political profiles . That was the last time McMath ever pressed his luck in the ring and , as a general rule , he leaves as little as possible to chance in anything that he undertakes . He does not , however , hesitate to take what the military calls a calculated risk when the circumstances warrant . In the summer of 1948 , for example , McMath had just concluded a hard fight for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination , which is tantamount to election in Arkansas . His prestige was at a new peak after the primary . The political fortunes of President Truman , on the other hand , seemed to be at a low ebb then , and there was a rush by Southern conservatives to launch the Dixiecrat movement , with Ben Laney , then governor of Arkansas , as one of the leaders . McMath was opposed to the party rebels , but he might easily have played it safe by remaining Passively on the side lines . Instead , he chose to take a calculated risk and carried the fight to the Dixiecrath so successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Truman column . Mr. Truman did n't forget . When the Arkansas Society gave a reception for McMath in Washington , the President drove through a snowstorm to make a surprise appearance , and , in Little Rock last summer , he broke his published schedule to call at the McMath home , where he made much over the governor 's young sons . The fact that three-year-old who inherits his father 's aggressiveness , Landed a beautiful roundhouse punch on the Presidential stomach and made threatening gestures with ft hammer gave the Secret Service detail some anx- itais moments , but apparently did no damage to the Truman-McMath friendship . Politically , McMath is a liberal in the South and would probably be regarded as a middle-of-the-road Democrat elsewhere . He is just under six feet tall , with a direct and friendly smile and a softly engaging drawl . He is one of the few men who ever lived Past the age of eighteen and could still appear handsome in the difficult dress uniform of the United States Marines . There is , too , a candid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like something ra ollywood might have worked up for a poster show-Mg the typical G.I. , grinning out from under a tin n at and ready for anything . The surprise is that he 18 able to live up to his photographs . One day after he became governor a strange horse which he mounted for an official occasion suddenly went haywire and tried to buck him off . McMath maintained , with ease , both his seat and the dignity of his office . A little later he was the star attraction before an overflow meeting of women voters . " The governor addressed our luncheon today , " one prominent clubwoman told her husband that evening . " He was wonderful. ? " What did he say ? " her husband asked . " Oh , I have no idea , " she replied . " We all just sat there and sighed . " Although he was a clever and experienced actor in college , McMath is something quite different from a political matinee idol . He is deadly serious , a skillful organizer and , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of his friends have remained loyal even in the hazardous field of one-party politics in Arkansas . His political campaigns have been run like military operations in which every move was carefully weighed and fitted into place , even to the point where each morning his secretary handed him a list of towns to be visited and persons to be seen , with a notation as to whether his attention to each individual should be limited to a handshake , a five-minute chat or a half hour of serious political discussion . As governor , he has n't been afraid to delegate authority , and the young men  --  their average age is forty and they include three former FBI agents  --  he brought into his administration operate on their own to a great extent . This leaves McMath free to direct policy and keep political fences in order , but he sometimes wonders whether his staff carries things a little too far in relieving him of routine detail . Not long ago he appeared unhappily in midmorning at his secretary 's desk and asked petulantly , " Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even one little letter that I could . read myself ? " A Star Pupil in the School of Experience P ERHAPS McMath 's greatest weakness has been his lack of either business or administrative experience outside of his wartime service as an officer in the marines . During the gubernatorial campaign , his foes put heavy emphasis on his youth and inexperience in public office , and immediately after his inauguration , in January of 1949 , he seemed bent on confirming their skepticism by exhibiting a tendency to speak out first and think about it later . Newspaper reporters reached the point where they felt he was changing his mind between editions and occasionally misleading them . He exhibited during the campaign a certain reluctance to say no to politicians , and so many actual or implied promises came home to roost later that one of the candidates he had defeated referred to him as " Governor McMyth . " PHOTOGRAPHY BY HILL SHROUT There never has been , however , any reluctance on McMath 's part to learn from his own mistakes , and after a wavering start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considerable success both as an administrator and as a negotiator with a talent for bringing together divergent viewpoints and personalities . His ability as a negotiator had first been suggested during his campaign for governor , when he achieved the seemingly impossible by uniting in support of himself two bitter enemies , Homer M. Adkins and the late Carl Bailey , both former governors who ran two of the biggest political organizations in the state and had not spoken to each other for years . Both friends and foes of McMath are inclined to agree that " if you give Sid ten minutes he can talk anybody into anything , " an ability he had a chance to demonstrate last October when eleven states faced severe economic losses , owing to the Missouri Pacific Railroad strike , which was particularly damaging to Arkansas . Older heads urged McMath to keep out of it , on the ground that it was a Federal problem and that failure would cost him prestige at home . The issue , however , was doubly important to the governor because he had long and persistently argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequately to provide social and governmental services is a major reason for the drift toward overly strong Federal Government . The states have relied too much on the Federal Government for the solution of problems that are primarily states ' problems , and municipalities and counties have relied too much on the states . " In line with this theory , he urged the governor of Missouri to call a conference of governors of states involved , and his initiative , persistence and firmness in negotiations that ended the strike were widely acknowledged . That success , McMath felt , was a demonstration of how states can and should reassume some of the powers that have gone by default to Washington . McMath 's efforts as a compromiser have not always been so successful , but he is not one to hesitate when more drastic measures are needed . Once during the war in the South Pacific he found himself in a canoe with two gaudily dressed cannibals , separated from his patrol and deep in Jap-held territory . The natives had volunteered to lead him to fresh water , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rowing ( Cott on page 11 f ) HE WANTS TO MAKE SOMETHING OF ARKANSAS ( Coat in oed from Page 27 ) him toward a cannibal cooking pot , and he ordered them to turn back . The native rowing in front seemed open to persuasion , but the one rowing behind ignored McMath and pushed steadily ahead . He argued . He gave them his rations . He promised presents . The front man listened , but the rear man was adamant . The McMath charm was on the verge of failure for the first and perhaps the last time until he turned persuasively to the obstreperous rear rower and brought the butt of his carbine up under the cannibal 's chin with sufficient impact to tumble him into the water . He then successfully completed his compromise with the remaining rower and returned to his patrol ? although without any fresh water . It is more or less characteristic of McMath that , on important occasions , he charges into the enemy stronghold , maneuvers himself into an impossible position , and then , to what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bright new coat of gold on his halo . " He always seemed to be coming to bat with two strikes.against him , " one of his friends remarked in recalling their boyhood , " but Sid never recognized the possibility that he might strike out . " Nobody would quarrel with the idea that McMath started out with a couple of strikes on him . He was horn on June 14 , 1912 , in a dogtrot cabin , which means two rooms built of logs and connected by a roofed-over passage with both aides left open , so the hound dogs can trot through it from front yard to back . His forebears were steady and respected people , but his father , Hal McMath , was a not-very-well-to-do farmer and horse trader living so far back in the hills from the town of Magnolia that even when Sid campaigned for governor in 1948 , he had to leave his automobile and ride a horse to get there . The family , including a daughter two years older than Sid , later moved to the booming Smackover oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lost everything except a wagon and team . They journeyed to Hot Springs when Sid was ten , and Hal McMath became a barber . The elder McMath was not , however , a good provider and he suffered periodic spells of depression during which he drank heavily . " He was not a weak man , " his son said later . " He was a strong man with a weakness . " As a wide-open gambling town and hide-out for some of the country 's most vicious mobsters , Hot Springs was an ideal place to nourish almost any human frailty . Watching his father 's unhappy struggle , Sid McMath developed a deep hatred for the conditions that existed there , and as a boy began forming the plan for doing something about it . Sid worked in his spare time because the family needed cash , but in high school he was elected president of his class every year , was elected the Most . Popular Boy , the Most Handsome Boy and the president of the Student Council . He also took the leading role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined because he said he did n't want to portray an insincere character . This attitude and February Ili. 1930 his monopoly of elective office might well have been insufferable to his classmates , but , strangely enough , almost nobody seemed to mind except Mrs. McMath . " Sidney , " she said when , with $2.50 in his pocket , he was leaving for college , " now you just let some of the other boys be president part of the time . " Sidney listened , but for once did n't follow her advice . He attended two schools in his freshman year , going briefly to Henderson State Teachers C011ege before transferring to the university , and he was president of the freshman class at both . He kept on being president as a sophomore , but switched to business manager of the student annual in his junior year and ended up as president of the student body . He worked his way through the university , but he was always short of cash , and one Christmas vacation he told his mother he had to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and savings at the time were thirty-two dollars . When she hesitated , Sid said , " It 's an investment you 'll never regret . " He got the thirty dollars . He was graduated from law school in 1936 without having made an outstanding scholastic record , but he knew everybody and was honor graduate of the university Military Training Corps , with a reserve commission that gave him a chance to spend a year as a marine recruiting officer in Philadelphia . Late in 1937 he went back to Hot Springs to open a law office with Clyde Brown and to marry Elaine Braughton , his high-school sweetheart . They had one son , Sidney Sanders , Jr . Elaine died of nephritis less than a year later . The war interrupted McMath 's plans before he had got anywhere in either politics or the practice of law . He had been described by his commanding officer in the C.M.T.C. as the finest natural soldier he had ever trained and , in the South Pacific , McMath made that description look good . As operations officer for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when the Japanese had the temerity to threaten defeat of the assault , be landed , according to the official report , at Cape Torokina under enemy fire and made his way " unprotected through hazardous areas to the foremost de ' ments . " At one point he was in an observation post that was hit by fifty rounds of enemy artillery , but he initiated a new attack that " contributed in la% measure to success of the operation . He was promoted in the field to lieu ' tenant colonel and awarded the Silver Star and the Legion of Merit . He later contracted malaria , was invalided home and stationed in Washington , where he met and married Anne Phillips , a Mississippian and secretary to a cow gressman from her home state . They have two sons . McMath 's courtship of Anne Was , later chronicled by his admirer and friend , Spider Rowland , a columnist 00 the Arkansas Gazette who keeps a con-siderable following gasping for breath most of the time . According to Spider , McMath was head over heels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning and worked him so hard all day that he was out on his feet after escorting Anne around town at night . With his usual logic , he figured he Was going to give out quickly on that schedule , so he hurried up his courting and at . the first opportunity proposed . When Anne agreed it was a good idea , he sighed and said , " Thank goodness . Now maybe I can get some sleep . " He then went groggily home , according to , Spider , without kissing her good night . It was certainly true that McMath Was working overtime then because the war was nearing its end and he was getting ready for the battle he had planned and dreamed about since grade school . Shortly before his discharge , he sat down before a recording machine and outlined a complete camPaign for the defeat of Mayor Leo P. McLaughlin , the sardonically handsome boss of Hot Springs . He pointed out the McLaughlin weaknesses , he suggested campaign speeches , he developed organizational ideas . A few days later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confidence . his own voice that he decided he could n't miss . He headed for home With high enthusiasm . The battle of Hot Springs became a kind of classic example of war-veteran Influence in early postwar politics , a Pattern that was imitated elsewhere , but never again reached the high peak of intensity , of heartbreak and of enthusiasm that rocked Arkansas in 1946 . , McLaughlin was smart and had ruth- Lessly knocked down all opposition for twenty years and , though some observers believed he was ripe for a fall , nobody had had the courage to buck hirn openly . The McMath plan boldly contemplated not only his defeat but the incarceration of McLaughlin in Jail for no less than fifty years . Raymond Clinton , a Hot Springs auto dealer who was unable to get into , the armed services , bad kept half a dozen of his friends advised of developTILE SATURDAY ments at home and had even raised a little money for the battle of Hot Springs . Most of the group got home from the war about the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schoenfeld , now attorney for the Public Service Commission ; I. G. Brown , now sheriff of Garland County ; Earl T. Ricks , who piloted the Japanese peace mission to MacArthur 's headquarters and is now adjutant general on McMath 's staff ; Leonard Ellis , who became circuit clerk ; Joe Campbell , David Whittington and a few others . The group realized that to win they had to overcome the people 's fear of retaliation by the machine and they had to destroy McLaughlin 's grip on the election machinery , which enabled his workers to buy up blocks of poll-tax receipts and vote them as they pleased . Even before announcing his candidacy for the job of prosecuting attorney , McMath toured Garland County , making speeches and showing combat films . They were n't pretty pictures , but they established the idea that the veterans were tough and knew how to take care of themselves . He and his friends carried the same idea into their daily routine and swaggered around Hot Springs almost in the manner of bully boys inviting the machine 's hoodlums to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few gamblers who had fallen out with McLaughlin , but it was weeks before they could get contributions from businessmen , and even then most of the donations were accompanied by a plea " not to tell a soul . " It was Schoenfeld who finally dug up the idea that made McLaughlin EVENING POST realize he was in for a fight with no quarter asked or given . Schoenfeld knew it was useless to challenge the machine 's election tricks in the state courts , but he argued that they could get the case into Federal court if they announced a write-in candidate for Congress . This device worked . The Federal court took jurisdiction on the ground that a Federal office was involved , and about one fifth of the purchased poll-tax receipts on which McLaughlin had counted were invalidated . The real showdown came a few days later . Gunmen held up two war-veteran workers who were checking at voters ' homes on poll-tax purchases , and stole the evidence they had collected . With Schoenfeld and Brown , McMath immediately stormed into McLaughlin 's office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything like this happens again , we intend to put a stop to it . But we wo n't waste time with small fry . We 'll start at the top . " McLaughlin 's failure to talk back gave them real hope for almost the first time . On Election Day , the veterans toured the county like a combat patrol , their automobiles loaded with guns . They stationed veterans with Air Force cameras  --  most of them without film  --  at polling places and started rumors that the FBI was getting evidence on repeat voters . Their volunteer telephone and automobile corps worked from dawn to dusk . They used every trick in the book . . . and they lost every race in Garland County . That was a gloomy night for the vets . The mighty McMath had struck out , it was agreed by practically everybody except McMath . He hung on , and the next morning he got a break . The prosecuting attorney 's race , unlike most of the contests in which the veterans had entered , included adjacent Montgomery County , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late returns from there squeezed him into the key job . McMath immediately persuaded the rest of the war-veteran ticket to enter the general election as independents and in November they ran the race all over again . The fact that McMath was going to be prosecuting attorney in any event ended the fear of machine ? reprisals and the vets swept the election by a wide margin . McLaughlin was indicted on fifteen counts of bribery and malfeasance , but McMath could never get a conviction . McMath 's staff in the prosecuting attorney 's office did a creditable job in the next two years , but his personal record as prosecutor is all but nonexistent . He was too busy running for governor . His personal publicity had been tremendous . He was a machine buster . He spoke in every corner of the state , with Earl Ricks flying him from meeting to meeting . McMath works at a tremendous pace , but he can relax quickly and was in the habit of falling asleep as soon as he got into the plane in order to make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on an out-of-state flight , one of the plane 's two engines died and Ricks sent his young copilot back to awaken McMath , who was sleeping on a folding cot . The boy returned shortly without McMath . " He wo n't get up , " he explained . " I told him we 'd lost an engine , and he said there was n't any way he could help us find it , and went back to sleep . I could n't drag him out of bed , could I ? " While McMath was away from Hot Springs on a political trip prior to announcement of his intention to run for 116 TlIE SATURDAY governor , he received word that a tragedy had occurred at his home . His father , who had been staying there , had been drinking and had fallen into such a violent rage that Anne McMath became frightened and then hysterical . Grabbing a revolver , she shot him fatally . McMath hurried home and , after the first shock had worn off , insisted that an outside prosecutor take over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined to return an indictment . Most observers believed the tragedy had ended McMath 's career ; that this time the third strike had been called against him . But when he talked it over with Schoenfeld a few days later , the only consideration he gave to that possibility was one remark , " I 'm not going to give up . " His campaign for governor moved steadily ahead , according to plan . McMath 's strongest opponent in a field of nine turned out to be Jack Holt , an experienced and skillful vote getter , but the candidate who really threw a scare into the McMath forces was a character known on the radio as Uncle Mac MacKrell , a persuasive talker , a repentant sinner and a deep bass voice in a gospel quartet . Uncle Mac out-promised everybody else , and ran up a total of 57,030 votes compared to 87,829 for McMath and 60,313 for Holt . Nobody had a majority . In the runoff , MacKrell supported Holt , but McMath won the race by a 10,000-vote margin as the climax of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the McMath forces spent probably $300,000 . The victory was generally attributed to McMath 's progressive attitude . There was a ring of sincerity about him that appealed to young people and to war veterans who had become tired of hearing jokes about the backwardness of Arkansas . In the final analysis , they agreed with McMath that there was plenty of room for improvement , but there was also plenty of reason to be proud of their state , and many of them believed that McMath might be the man through whom that pride could be expressed . McMath himself never doubted it for a second . Like most candidates for office in Arkansas in the past , McMath promised more than he could produce . But unlike many of his predecessors , he has n't let anything go by default . He formed advisory committees of members of the legislature , private citizens and technical experts to study each major problem and recommend a program and to ride herd on it through the legislature . He went to the people to hear their side of each question and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state both before and after his inauguration became so routine and a source of such broad humor that on one occasion a Little Rock newspaper published a story about the governor 's activities for the week under the headline : MCMATH TO SPEND HALF AN HOUR IN OFFICE THIS WEEK . The handling of the educational program , which McMath considers his most important objective , illustrates his methods . Ranking forty-seventh among the states , Arkansas had 1600 school districts for 500,000 pupils , spent about $82 per pupil per year , compared with a national average of $155 , needed extensive repairs or rebuilding of half of its 5000 school buildings , and failed to provide 125,000 pupils with the chance to attend accredited high schools . McMath persuaded Dr. A. B. Bonds , Jr. , a native of Arkansas , to quit his job with the Atomic Energy CommisEVENING POST sion 's educational division and become Arkansas ' Commissioner of Education . Under Bonds ' direction , the planning of a program for consolidation of schools , building and equipnient improvement , higher salaries and equal opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting it into practice . There was bitter opposition to abandonment of the little red schoolhouse in many rural communities , there was fear of tax increases and there was a general tendency to let things ride along . The legislature , meeting immediately after McMath 's inauguration , reflected these sentiments , but for the most part fell into line after the governor had employed his best persuasive tactics , which included a series of small friendly dinners at his home and an obstinate disinclination to deal out patronage until he saw results on the voting record . With legislative approval , he and Bonds then started selling the idea of self-improvement to the voters . They got together thirty busses and fifteen trucks and loaded them with the latest school equipment , including movie projectors , green blackboards , new-style chairs and desks , new and better lights , and everything else they could find for the schoolroom . A sound truck blaring martial music led the procession from town to town . McMath found an old oil lamp that he brandished before the crowds to emphasize that Arkansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bonds and his aides demonstrated the new equipment and explained the purpose of consolidation and the system of transportation that would be provided . " We were a bit idealistic , a bit Boy Stoutish , " Bonds said later , " but , fortunately , we believed in what we were Baying and we attracted plenty of attention . " Although McMath had campaigned against higher taxes , the caravan was so well received that 96 per cent of the school districts voted to increase the local millage rate . At the same time a drive sponsored by McMath resulted in a voluntary reassessment of property for tax purposes that raised the average in most districts . As a result , Arkansas schools will have $4,400,000 additional funds available for this school year , and in the following year the total to be spent on education will be around $92 , - 000,000 . The 1600 school districts have been reduced to 423 , with a minimum of 350 pupils each ; every pupil is able to attend an accredited high school ; the average spent per pupil has gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired ; and localities have voted bond issues totaling $18,000,000 for repair and construction . Arkansas still has a long way to go to reach the McMath objective of being at least twenty-fifth among the states , and there is a considerable number of unhappy voters , but both the governor and Bonds feel that the important thing is local support of a sound educational system and that time will do the rest . McMath 's highway program developed in much the same way , except that there has been sharp controversy over the wisdom of a $28,000,000 bond issue which the governor sponsored rebruary 18. 195 ? and the voters approved as an integral part of the four-year $80,000,000 plan for building some 2200 miles of roads . McMath feels that he has been about 90 per cent successful on the rest of his program . The old-age-pension average has been raised to twenty-eight dollars a month , ten dollars short of his promise , and a system of educating pensioners in crafts that will supplement their income has been initiated . His over-all election-reform bill , which was widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local elections , was defeated , but some reforms were salvaged later , and McMath intends to press for elimination of the poll tax entirely . These are merely high spots in his program , and they might suggest that he is rolling along an easy road , which at this stage would be a highly dangerous conclusion . His opposition has been , and probably will be , formidable . FEB appointments have alienated many job seekers . Contrary to campaign prom " lees , he has indirectly raised taxes by eliminating certain exemptions and boosting the price of farm and heavy trucking licenses . His highway program can not possibly satisfy everybody , and could , if it falls too far short of expectations , cause a dangerous political backfire by the time he must seek re-election next summer . His revenue commissioner , former FBI Agent Dean Morley , has cracked down on liquor-law violators in an effort to eliminate polities in that department , and has consequently ruffled important political feathers . The highly influential Arkansas Power &; Light Company has kept a wary eye on McMath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is overspending and believe , probably Or ' rectly , that higher taxes will be up ' avoidable . McMath 's advocacy of an antilynah law , which got nowhere , and his sup " port of equal educational opportunity for Negroes , on which he has malt progress , have not endeared him to elements of the electorate . Nor can he overlook the effectiveness in certain areas of attacks such as those in the Voice of Arkansas , which is published every so often by Uncle Mac MacKrell . The Voice so far has accused McMaW of running for President , encouraging bootlegging into dry Oklahoma , failing to respect God ? because highway ern " ployees were seen cutting weeds on Sunday  --  and double-crossing his friends . All these things considered , however , the McMath Plan has made rather re " markable progress , in view of the fact that the governor 's formal career as a politician actually got under way less than five years ago . His friends firmlY believe he is just getting started , but sometimes his spectacular rise promp ? his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , when she read in the newspaper about Sidney getting a swollen hand up at the capitol because so many persons cattle to congratulate him . Grandmother Mc ' Math read the item over carefully and then sent the governor a telegram that went about as follows : READ ABOUT YOUR SWOLLEN HAND. ; I WO N'T WORRY AS LONG AS IT 'S NOT YOUR HEAD . MOTHER MAE ? The McMaths have had their feet on Arkansas soil for a long time now , and most folks figure that Sidney , for alibi ! new ideas , has learned how to keep 11 ? 1 boots on the ground too .
