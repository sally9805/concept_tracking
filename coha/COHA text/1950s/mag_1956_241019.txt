Love Me Tender ( 20th Century-Fox ) . Is it a sausage ? It is certainly smooth and damp-looking , but who ever heard of a 172-lb. sausage 6 ft. tall ? Is it a Walt Disney goldfish ? It has the same sort of big , soft , beautiful eyes and long , curly lashes , but who ever heard of a goldfish with sideburns ? Is it a corpse ? The face just hangs there , limp and white with its little drop-seat mouth , rather like Lord Byron in the wax museum . <P> But suddenly the figure comes to life . The lips part , the eyes half close , the clutched guitar begins to undulate back and forth in an uncomfortably suggestive manner . And wham ! The midsection of the body jolts forward to bump and grind and beat out a low-down rhythm that takes its pace from boogie and hillbilly , rock ' n ' roll and something known only to Elvis and his pelvis . As the belly dance gets wilder , a peculiar sound emerges . A rusty foghorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the voice of a cricket , by the violent stridulation of the legs ? Words occasionally can be made out , like raisins in cornmeal mush . " Goan . . . git . . . luhhv . . . " And then all at once everything stops , and a big , trembly tender half smile , half sneer smears slowly across the CinemaScope screen . The message that millions of U.S. teen-age girls love to receive has just been delivered . <P> In his first screen appearance , with four songs and a secondary role as the hero 's little brother in an otherwise routine south western , Elvis Presley all but steals the show from such better-knowrn players as Richard Egan . Debra Paget and Mildred Dunnock . Hollywood , moreover , foresees a box-office bonanza when the millions who buy Presley 's pressings ( Heartbreak Hotel , Hound Dog ) go to see his first picture-and that will really be a steal . <P> <P> Marcelino ( Charmartn ; U.M.P.O. ) . In the 13th century after Christ , King Alfonso X of Castile and Leon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commanded that a chronicle be made of all the miracles that in all times had occurred within the limits of his realm . It was done ; and among the marvels that the scholars heard and dutifully set down was the story of Marcelino . <P> <P> A long time ago . before people stopped noticing miracles and started saying that they do not happen , a newborn baby was left one summer 's night at the gate of a little Franciscan cloister that sat on the top of a high hill in the land of Spain . " It 's a baby ! ' gasped the friar who found the precious package . He conducted a discreet investigation : " It 's a boy ! " And he ran to show the others what a wonder had come into their quiet lives . Brother Thomas , the cook , a man as simple and round and solid as Mother Earth , took charge of the situation . The child was crying . Brother Thomas dipped a cloth in water and gave it to him to suck . The crying stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Father Superior with a pleading look . " C-can we keep him . Father ? " <P> They kept him . The Father Superior was won over in the end , even though he insisted that the child needed a mother . <P> They christened the baby Marcelino because he had come to them on St. Marcelino 's Day , and each of the brothers tried to be both a mother and a father to him . <P>
