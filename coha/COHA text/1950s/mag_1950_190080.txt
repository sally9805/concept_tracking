At a U.S. command post in Korea , an infantry captain returning from fallen Taejon ran into a major who was on his way back to Japan . The infantry officer asked the major to take a message to his wife in Tokyo , was told : " I 'll do better than that . Talk into this recorder and I 'll take your voice back to your wife . " The captain 's message , punctuated by the noises of the command post , was broadcast last week by the Columbia Broadcasting System . This is what he said : <P> " I do n't know where to start on this . These last three weeks have been pretty rough . We 're getting help here now . That 's something we sure did n't have when we started . What makes it so difficult here is - the captain halted for a second , then resumed-that you , ca n't tell the damn North Koreans from the South Koreans . That caused a lot of slaughter . . . <P> " We had a narrow escape here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good men . Hope we never get into a scrape like that again . Present time we 're trying to regroup . <P> " There 's no question how this will come out . We 'll come out on top . It 's going to take a lot more-a lot more than we have over here . This affair is more than a police action . It 's something-the captain paused , and millions of radio listeners heard him exhale-gigantic . I know it is . Been through the Pacific and part of the European campaign , but I never ran into anything like this before . <P> " And you can believe me this time , baby , there 'll never be another separation . I know I 've told you that , time and time again . But it seems that the six years that we 've been married , I 've been here and you 've been there , and it 's getting so that I do n't even know my own son . Wonder if he remembers . <P> " ... I want you to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of weight . She should be happy about that . Give my regards to all the neighbors there . Please , please do n't worry . And if you do n't get my letters , understand that things are n't quite up to snuff yet . Okay ? Au revoir ! You know that I love you very much . "
