SWEET THURSDAY ( 273 pp. ) - John Steinbeck-Viking ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> John Steinbeck respects the underdog , but he melts uncontrollably before a no-good , boozed-up bum . His sentimental eulogies of riffraff began with his first successful book . Tortilla Flat ( 1935 ) , continued in Cannery Row ( 1945 ) , and appear again in Sweet Thursday , which is really a return visit to Cannery Row . It reads like stuff that has been salvaged from the wastebasket . All the characters in Sweet Thursday ( who live in Monterey , Calif. , Steinbeck 's home territory ) have a lot in common : rotgut whisky in their bellies , leather in their hides , gold in their hearts and bats in their belfries . <P> In the cast which peoples Steinbeck 's skid row are the following weirdies : <P> A madam called Fauna who runs the Bear Flag and once masterminded a flourishing South American export trade in shrunken human heads . She keeps a former competitor 's noggin in a desk drawer to remind her of the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flag who is writing a novel called The Pi Root of Oedipus . <P> A middle-aged Ph.D . named Doc , previously characterized in Cannery Row by Steinbeck as " half Christ and half satyr , " who spends a lot of his nondrinking time stimulating a tankful of octopuses into apoplexy , for research purposes . <P> A beachcombing seer who lives on sea lettuce and stolen candy bars . <P> A Los Angeles hoodlum named Joseph and Mary Rivas , who graduated from " switch knives , snap guns . . . and , for the very poor , socks loaded with sand " to ownership of the Lee Chong Grocery , and now keeps busy trying to figure out a way to cheat at chess . <P> Hazel , a male deadbeat , who owes his name to a remarkably unobservant mother . He lives with other deadbeats at the Palace Flophouse and is deeply disturbed by his horoscope , which indicates that he is destined to be President of the U.S. <P> Plot ? Yes , there is one , of sorts . Scholarly Doc is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cannery Row decide that he needs a woman , perhaps even a wife . While guzzling a liquid killer called " Old Tennis Shoes , " they pick the girl , a scrappy newcomer at the Bear Flag named Suzy . Suzy is unsure of herself . It seems that she was rejected as a child . As she tells it to her friend Hazel : <P> " Once , when I was a kid . I made an ashtray for my old man and old lady . . . " <P> " They like it ? " <P> " They did n't need no ashtray . " <P> With her ashtray complex working overtime , Suzy makes a bachelor girl 's flat out of an abandoned 16-ft. boiler and starts slinging ham &; eggs at the local hash house . Just when the matchmaking plans appear to be spiked . Cannery Row focuses its cloudy mind long enough to bring the two lovers together by an action as silly as it is surprising . <P> Sweet Thursday is a turkey with visibly Saroyanesque stuffings . But where Saroyan might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality , Steinbeck merely comic-strips them of all reality and even of very much interest .
