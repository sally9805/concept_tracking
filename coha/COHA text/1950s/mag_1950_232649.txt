" Why , " asked the American , " are all the women in cocktail dresses at noon ? " " Custom , " said the Frenchman . " Why , " asked the American , " are the men in mufflers and overcoats though it is hot ? " <P> " Custom , " said the Frenchman . " Why , " asked the American , " does everyone stand looking at the little door with the steps leading up to it ? " <P> " Behind that door , " said the Frenchman , " the members of the Goncourt Academy are selecting the best one of the 300 novels published in France this year for Edmond de Goncourt ' s 5,000-franc prize . " <P> Five Pouilly-Fuisss . At the Restaurant Drouant in the Rue Gaillon , the academy members were taking longer than usual to make their annual selection . A waiter battled his way through the crowd , muttering : " My God , four ballots and five Pouilly-Fuisss and still these gentlemen have decided nothing ! " Someone said : " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not ... " A voice roared : " Passageway ! Clear a space for the photographers ! " The door of the inner room opened , and looking solemnly down on the surging crowd stood Pierre Mac Orlan , painter , novelist , . and youngest ( 67 ) member of the academy , who , by tradition , must announce the winner .

Novelist Colin , a thin , retiring young man , was living on unemployment relief . <P> But a few hours later , guest of honor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through an amazing series of adventures . Colin , who would have found it hard to get into the editor 's office of Figaro on Monday , wrote Figaro 's front-page literary essay on Wednesday . A short story that Colin could not place on Monday appeared Thursday in Les Nouvelles Littraires . By Saturday his novel was being serialized in France-Dimanche , a sensational weekly . All week the presses roared , boosting the total printing of his book ( a modest story about a group of adults who try to recapture the happy camaraderie of childhood on an estate in the Sologne region , and fail because they no longer possess the simple cruelty of children ) from the original 5,000 to 100,000 . <P> Three Martinis . Something similar , though on a smaller scale , was happening simultaneously to a score of other French authors . The Prix Femina had gone to Serge Groussard for his La femme sans pass , a grim story of a murderess ' flight on a river barge ; the Prix Thophraste Renaudot to Pierre Molaine ( in real life Major Lopold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his Les orgues de I'enfer , a story about a resistance fighter hiding from the Gestapo in an insane asylum . The fourth big prize , the Prix Interalli , was yet to come .
