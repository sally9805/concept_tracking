txt Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations matter learnings will not occur . In any situation , boys and girls are striving to feel right about themselves , to feel that they have worth , to feel that they are accepted . Other learnings are secondary and will not receive the full attention of students until these first learnings receive satisfaction . Only when children work in an atmosphere in which they can respect themselves and know that they are respected by others , are they ready to begin learning about science , mathematics , and grammar . Not only does the emotional aspect of the environment determine the efficiency of learning . It provides some of the most basic learning which we have . We have not recognized clearly enough that the actual emotional content itself is being learned . The type of human relations that exist within the school teaches the youngster how to feel toward others and what to believe about others . To varying degrees he learns : to accept all people , or to reject certain people who do not measure up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encourage people and have faith in them , or to suspect the other person and expect only failure to live up to responsibilities ; that it is good to work together , or that he must work alone , without help ; that adults are people who are helpful and can be trusted , or that he must cover up his true emotional beliefs and feelings when he is talking to them ; that most situations offer many choices , or that most situations are either " all good " or " all bad . " In short , 50 What Quality of Human Relations Do We Seek ? he learns to some extent and in some forms inclusiveness , openmindedness , acceptance , and confidence , or exclusiveness , closed-mindedness , rejection , and suspicion . We learn what we live . Further , the emotional climate determines the significance with which we endow an idea and the use to which we put it . For example , if a student encounters the writings of Shakespeare in an atmosphere of good humor , respect among students , free sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays are worth reading , that the ideas expressed have application today , and that the author would be fun to read in spare time . If , on the other hand , Shakespeare is studied in a classroom in which the teacher has all the answers and the student may only guess , where too many wrong guesses will be punished by ridicule or failure , where students may not interchange ideas or laugh unless the teacher thinks a line is humorous , the odds are good that the student will not give Shakespeare 's ideas serious consideration or return to his works for inspiration or leisure-time reading . The potency of an idea is determined by the emotional matrix in which it is embedded . A second-grade class in Kentucky gave real evidence that they were living in a good emotional climate . They were writing an account of the day 's activities . The children dictated and the teacher wrote their statements on the blackboard . They had agreed upon : Today is April 3 , 1952 . The sun is shining . It is a beautiful day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a visitor to our class . The teacher had had several pupils read what they had stated . Finally , she turned to the total group and asked if there was anything they wanted to add . One little boy raised his hand quickly and , grinning from ear to ear , yelled " School is fun . " The entire group chorused , " Yes ! Yes ! " 51 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations How Do We Feel About Ourselves ? An important asset or liability to the establishment of a good emotional climate is how we , as teachers , feel about ourselves . If we feel inadequate , superior , or rebellious , we can not effectively help pupils create a wholesome emotional climate in which all feel that they belong , accept others , and help each other . If we want to promote good human relations , we begin our teaching by examining ourselves and identifying and working to eliminate those qualities within oti selves which hinder them . If we are not confident of our ability to work successfully in situations that arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of covering up our incompetence , of proving our superiority , of gaining personal security , even though the techniques we use mean infringing on the rights of others . We must always win . We develop any technique that we . can for making people aware of our superiority . One way is to hold up exceedingly high standards in the area in which we are highly competent , and to reject boys and girls who can not achieve these competencies . We keep pupils from ever getting close enough to know us in order to prevent their discovering our weaknesses . A major portion of our feelings of inadequacy comes from pretending that we have no weaknesses , from creating a false picture of ourselves . All of us have weaknesses , teachers as well as pupils . Unless we recognize and accept this condition , we have to resort to tactics that make it impossible for us to work on a friendly , cooperative basis with children . We need to be able to say , " I do n't know , " simply , humbly , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have weak-52 What Quality of Human Relations Do We Seek ? nesses , all of us can contribute from our strengths . We can recognize with children the weaknesses that each of us has , hilt at the same time we can bring to the fore the special contributions that each of us can make . This stress on the positive is something that applies to the teacher 's contributions as much as it does to the contribution of pupils . If we make this approach , it puts us in a position in which there is no need for proving our ability to others . We accept ourselves as we are and we know our own competencies . We contribute what we have and expect others to do the same . We work to eradicate our weaknesses so we can be of more help to others . We need to feel sufficiently confident and mature so that we can consider pupil behavior objectively . If we are , we examine constantly the type of treatment that we give boys and girls to see whether or not it is an attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . As a teacher , we can not wear our feelings on our sleeve . A mature person can accept the action of a less mature person , can analyze that action , and can take the steps necessary for the less mature person to grow more mature . To the extent that we fight back at youngsters to get even with them , we are reflecting our own immaturity and are revealing our inadequacy to help create an environment in which boys and girls can become more mature . We must have enough security within ourselves to be able to put the welfare of the pupil first . Only then can we recognize that there are times when it is better for us to lose than it is for us to win , when it is more important for an insecure boy or girl to have the experience of winning in any issue with the teacher . An expression of hostility may be a symptom of disturbance rather than a token of personal dislike or antagonism . To the extent that we feel superior , we decrease our potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrte feelings of superiority , we alienate the other person . When we feel superior , we make it impossible for us to really appreciate the other person and to understand the contribution that he can make to group living and to us ! When we ca n't 53 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations appreciate or understand or really know the other person , we ca n't expect to have good relationships with him or to help him have good relationships with other people . On the surface , feelings of superiority may seem to come out of an ability to do more complicated mathematical operations or to handle verbs with more skill . Or we may feel superior because we know certain facts that other people do n't know or because we have a different color or religion or nationality , or even because we have more money . All these feelings of superiority , however , are based on a feeling of insecurity that makes it necessary for us to be superior to other people in order to be safe and secure within ourselves . Some feelings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils grow only as they become more and more like us . This is a hard stereotype to avoid . Our experiences have led us to certain conclusions and have given us certain skills . We have been employed by boards of education to help boys and girls grow . By the very process of employing us , the board of education may seem to us to have put the stamp of approval on the type of growth that we have made . Some of us have moved from that assumption to the belief that it is our job to help boys and girls to be like us . No doubt we are quite sincere . We really believe that we have the answer to the world 's problems , that we are the type of person who succeeds best in the world . Because of these beliefs , we attempt to have boys and girls become like us . But when we attempt to get others to be like us , we reject the multiplicity of values that are within our own culture . We fail to recognize the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own contributions . We fail to recognize that ours is a plural culture in which there are many skills , 54 , What Quality of Human Relations Do We Seek ? understandings , and values that contribute to the welfare and development of the total social group . When we feel that others must attain our status , we sometimes provide the type of teaching and guidance that leads people to move in the direction of goals that may be blind alleys for them . For example , a study conducted in the late thirties showed that 95 per cent of the boys and girls in American high schools were seeking white-collar jobs . This same study shows that only 5 per cent of the jobs in America at that time were white-collar jobs . Approximately 90 per cent of our population in American secondary schools were moving toward jobs that they could never occupy . Teachers who believe that youngsters should be molded in their pattern must accept a share of the responsibility for such false guidance . I f we feel that teaching is unworthy of our best efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us into teaching , we have feelings that interfere with our creating good human relations in the classroom . If we feel that teaching is just a job and that we must put up with the " brats " to draw our salary , It is easy to guess that our classroom will be one in which we will be on One side and the pupils will be lined up against us . Pupils sense how the Moocher feels toward them and fortunate their own relationship toward the teacher by the attitude the teacher takes first toward them . Pupils respond to the type of treatment that they get , and any attitude of superiority or resentment our part will alienate them and prevent them from considering us as a person to be trusted or accepted . If we feel superior , inadequate , or resentful , we can not be Sod with our present status . We can change by recognizing 55 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations that all persons have these feelings in varying degrees , but that they decrease as we focus our attention more sharply on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time we spend in self-pity or self-worship . How Do We Feel About Pupils ? A beginning teacher in Kentucky found an eighteen-year-old boy , homely and weighing over two hundred pounds , in her sophomore English class . Ills appearance and reputation as a trouble-maker and poor student made the teacher wish that he had been assigned to the class of a more experienced colleague . For two months the teacher endured him , dreading the period when he appeared in her roorn ? and he made no progress . One night , in a moment of soul-searching , the young woman suddenly realized that she hated the boy , that she was wishing liini failure rather than success . Conscience-stricken , she asked herself if there was n't at least one good quality in the youth and resolved to search for one the very next day . By her own testimony , the teacher was amazed by the change that came over the boy in the next few weeks . Actually , the basic change was in the teacher . She began to see strong qualities in the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to find in other people , and persons tend to live up to what we expect of them . If we are to he effective , we want each person in our class to succeed . We are not with the class to sort and classify and label . We are not there to help some to succeed and cause others to fail . Our job is to hope and to work for the growth of all . It is our function to help each pupil develop his strengths and overcome his weaknesses . If we are going to help the total class , we have faith in each pupil . We believe that each has potential leadership and ability to make a contribution to the group and to society . Even though his talents are hidden beneath a surface of indifference , hostility , filth , or social ineptness , we believe that each child 56 What Quality of Human Relations Do We Seek ? can be better than he is , and our success is judged by the extent to which each realizes his potential . Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All students , like teachers , have weaknesses . None will have all the answers or all the necessary skills . These weaknesses are opportunities for us to be of assistance , not stigmas for which we condemn a child . A machine-scored test can locate a lack of knowledge or skill , but a teacher by faith and by providing the experiences that will promote the needed growth can help a child improve himself . If we are to provide leadership for all , we are willing for pupils to be different . We will find that strengths vary from pupil to pupil . Elementary teachers , who work with pupils in many different types of activities , have a better opportunity than do secondary teachers , who work with children in a limited field , to see the range of abilities possessed by the r individual and the group . Because of this greater breadth of experience with the child , many elementary teachers have gone further in accepting and encouraging different kinds of contribution and leadership . All of us can go still further in accepthug and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humor , human relations , and sensitivity are as important p abstract mental manipulations . Let 's recognize it . Moreover , we will be willing for pupils to have purposes that are different from our own . If we recognize that motivation comes from the vision developed through past experience , we know it is useless to expect pupils from different backInds to have the same purposes and ambitions that we do . We recognize the difference , and let the pupils know we understand it , but we do not proclaim their goals less worthy than In short , we want to know pupils , to understand them , to recognize their strengths , weaknesses , and purposes , and to have faith in their potential and our ability to help them realize it . 57 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations How Do We Treat Pupils ? Is our acceptance of children shown in our courtesy to them ? We teach courtesy as we create an environment in which people are naturally courteous toward each other , and the major factor in developing such an atmosphere is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by statements . If we hope to teach boys and girls to be courteous to each other , we are courteous to them . Courtesy includes such things as remembering and calling them by name , speaking to them as they cone into the room , acknowledging requests , saying " please " to therm just as we expect them to say " please " to us , asking permission of individuals and the group in just the same type of situation in which we expect them to ask permission of us . We are as much bound by the code of behavior as the pupils arc and any deviation from it on our part requires as much of an apology or explanation as any deviation on the part of a pupil . If we set ourselves above the code of behavior that is accepted by the group , we signify that codes are binding only on those who are not in a position of authority . We teach respect for manners and mores and ways of behaving by the way we accept our role within the group as a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established by the classroom society . If we expect boys and girls to call us by the title that we prefer , we have the same responsibility to them . If a child wants to be called " Lucky " rather than Nathaniel , we should abide by his decision . If he wishes to be called " Bill " rather than Mr. Smith , that too should be a decision of his that we respect . Working with children in a courteous manner requires that we treat them as adults . When we talk down to children , we belittle them . When we treat them as inferiors and as persons of lesser ability , we are making clear to them that we behave toward people in accordance with their power and position rather than in accordance with their individual worth . 58 What Quality of Human Relations Do We Seek ? As we attempt to teach courtesy , we are faced with the fact that in many communities the manners that exist are not acceptable to us . In such a situation , it is our job to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plan with them which of the various ways of behaving they want to practice and follow in the classroom . From time to time we will want to evaluate with youngsters the satisfaction or lack of satisfaction with the code of behavior that exists within the class group . Our hope is that we will bring about an improvement as we take time in our regular program for discussion of better ways of living together . We need , however , to be able to view progress , or lack of it , quite objectively , and recognize that the growth we hope for may require a higher price in cultural conflict than the children are able to pay . How Do We Want Each Student To Feel About Himself ? Students , like the teacher , must feel right about themselves If good human relations are to prevail . Unless each student can believe that he has worth and is able to contribute to the group , his potential for aggression or withdrawal is strong . 1 f good human relations are to prevail in the class , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will be missed if he is not present , will be welcomed back after each absence , and has equal opportunity in the group ; that he is at ease with the group ? recognizing that he will make mistakes but knowing that they will be accepted as learning experiences ; that he is successful ? is accomplishing , knows where he is going , is putting forth his best effort to reach his goals , and feels confident ; that he has a responsibility to the group ? can help others , and can make a positive contribution to the success of the group . 59 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations Helping a pupil achieve these feelings about himself involves all aspects of teaching : planning , group work , individual counseling , evaluation , and consultation with parents . Each month that we work with pupils should bring them closer to achieving these attitudes toward themselves . How Do We Want Students To Feel About Each Other ? The fourth dimension of human relations in the class is how the students feel about each other . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cornerstone , but equally essential is the positive concern of pupil for pupil . We want students to know each other , and to learn about the backgrounds and interests of each person in the group , in the hope that from this knowledge will develop common interests and appreciation of one another . But knowing is not enough . Sometimes information about the other person leads to dislike , fear , or hatred . There are many cues which indicate time type of pupil-topupil relationships that exist in the class . One of them is the kind of remark pupils make about the total group . In one school , in which the pupils were grouped homogeneously on the basis of their LQ. scores , a class that was at the bottom of the list was making very little progress in school and displayed a lackadaisical attitude toward school work . When their teacher attempted to help , through an evaluation session in which the class was asked how their effectiveness as a group could be improved , one of the pupils remarked , " We are the dumb-bells of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while and we are waiting until we are old enough to quit school . " Even though this school attempted to fool boys and girls by revising the names given to the low and high sections each year , the students were not misled . They knew their classmates and they knew the students who were in other sections . They sensed the frustration their classmates felt and they had been 60 What Quality of Human Relations Do We Seek ? able to detect the attitude that teachers held toward them . As a defense measure , they had adopted the attitude that not much could be expected of them . As the conversation continued , the student added , " We do n't have a chance . Not one of us has ever won anything . " The class had lost its pride and its sense of ability to achieve . They felt that the cards were stacked against them and that no one from their group could exert real leadership in the school . When any group of people has been taught to feel about itself as this class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the basis of good mental hygiene , and initiative , which makes possible continued growth . One teacher , working with a similar group , put her major emphasis during the first few months that the group was together on building confidence in the group . When the school undertook a paper drive , the teacher put more time and effort into helping the class win the drive than she did in teaching basic skills . She was more concerned that this group of boys and girls should feel the confidence that came from winning recognition from the total school than she was about moving ahead on scheduled class work . She knew that until this group came to respect itself most of her efforts in teaching skills and facts would be futile . And they won . After the group had regained some of its self-confidence through this achievement , she was ready to move on to other activities in which the group had constantly failed . An interesting side light on this particular class was that most of the members came from homes of the lower economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as raising money for the Red Cross or selling student activity tickets , they had never been 61 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations able to compete successfully because their parents had not been able to contribute as much as those from a more favored economic status . When schools allow their competition between class groups to give the privileged economic groups an advantage , they tend further to decrease the self-respect of youngsters who already are faced with many difficulties . On the other hand , some groups never question their status or their rights . Such comments as " We always win , " " We have the best students in the school in our class , " " We have so much we will give our old toys to the poor boys and girls , " all indicate feelings of superiority . ' these groups need to work on the concept of sharing on an equal basis rather than of giving out of their riches to those who are of inferior status . Another indication of the way class members feel about themselves is their attitude toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance of their room and continually want to improve it , we have an indication of high morale in the group . When they begin to think about decorating their room for special holidays or their own enjoyment and begin to analyze the special contributions each can make , we know that a sense of groupness is developing . When they bring their friends and parents to see the classroom and the activities that take place there , we can be assured that the relationships in the room are moving in the right direction . When they want to come back after school and work on projects or plans , the atmosphere is good . The social relationships of a class group are shown by whether or not the students want to be together . Does the class want to have class parties or do certain members hold back and say that they are too busy ? All of us are constantly making choices in terms of the things we value most . When a percentage of the class group indicates that they value other relationships more than associating with members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human relationships within the classroom have not moved to a high plane . 62 What Quality of Human Relations Do We Seek ? By observing the class members at dances and football games , we can tell whether they have developed enough liking for each other to enjoy being together . Another index is the kind of remark that pupils make about each other . When one pupil makes a remark that belittles another member of the group , he is belittling the entire group . lie is saying that the class has not become a group as far as he is concerned . It does n't include the person he is belittling . On the other hand , when members begin to show concern in off-the-record conversation about the ways they can help other class members to grow , class relations are moving in the right direction . When one student says , " Don talks too much and Is too dogmatic in what he says ? what can we do to help him ? , " we have evidence of growing concern for each other . If three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how they can help others , group feeling within the class is growing . One of the technical devices for finding out how students fed toward each other is the sociogram , in which students are asked to indicate the persons with whom they would like to work . Although it is an effective device for revealing grouping mid isolation within a class , it has certain disadvantages . Care is necessary to insure that its use does not start boys and girls thinking about people they like and dislike , thus increasing differences rather than developing common concerns . It can 1w an instrument for building exclusiveness rather than cooperation . Why use a sociogram at all , then ? Is n't it better simply to bet with the students and observe them closely ? Has n't the sociogram technique been validated by comparing its results with the results obtained through the insight of teachers who Study children in other ways ? What if the evidence from the sociogram contradicts the evidence from observation ? Which is more valid ? The sociogram is a short-cut technique to help us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study 63 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations is limited . It helps us identify the pupils who need the most help in improving their human relations skills . But the evidence it provides is not superior to other evidence that we collect through continued association with the children . After rapport has been established in a group , the use of the sociogram may be planned with pupils as one way of collecting additional data to be used in planning how to work together . As we work with a group , we strive to assist the children to discover things they enjoy doing together and to diminish the procedures that separate and cause dissension . We seek to live with them in a manner that encourages them to accept each other , to develop concern for each other , and to have pride in the achievements of all members of the group . We want them to know each other 's strengths and weaknesses and to assume responsibility for helping each other to grow . How Do We Want Students To Feel About Us ? A group of California @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they wanted their pupils to believe they were : ( a ) friendly . We want our students to believe that we want to be friends with each member of the class , that we are approachable , and that we accept each one as a person of importance and worth . ( b ) trustworthy . We want our students to believe that we can be trusted , that we can be depended upon to live up to our word , that we will not take advantage of persons less able than ourselves , and that we will play fair with all students at all times . ( c ) helpful . We want our students to believe that we are with them to help them , that we are resource persons to whom they can turn for assistance in solving their problems , that we believe our job is to work with them and provide guidance as needed or requested , and that we respect their purposes and problems . ( d ) wise and skilled . We want our students to believe that even though we make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Relations Do We Seek ? ter fields , that we keep informed of developments in our specialization and in world events , that we are versatile and can apply our knowledge and skills to many problems , and that we are still learning with them . ( e ) consistent . We want our students to believe that we have a set of values that we live by , that we are predictable , that we will exercise the same type of self-control from day to day , and that we will work honestly with the group . But boys and girls do not regard all teachers in this light . Children bring to the classroom the stereotypes of teachers which are a part of their social environment . In the past , teachers have been looked upon as outside the typical community pattern . Parents have said that the teacher was supposed to set an example and that actions in which he engaged should be judged by an even higher standard than the action of parents . In some homes the teacher has beenlooked down upon as a person slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person who knew more , certainly an impractical person who went into a less remunerative type of activity . Children acquire the attitudes of their parents and of the community toward teachers . After the first few months in school , pupils develop attitudes toward teachers that grow out of their experiences with them . By the time a child gets to third , fourth , or fifth grade , he has had many experiences that condition the point of view he takes toward any new teacher whom he meets . Either he is willing to accept that teacher and to give him a fair break or he schemes to put the teacher in an unfortunate , undesirable position . Some pupils believe that teachers are persons who can not 1w trusted . Their experiences with teachers have led them to the conclusion that you ca n't tell teachers anything and have your confidences kept . Other students look upon teachers as persons who punish . They have had sufficient experience with 65 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations authoritarian teachers to conclude that all teachers are dictators , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way without any consideration of their feelings , interests , and purposes . Still other boys and girls come to the classroom with a watchful attitude toward teachers . Their experiences have led them to believe that some teachers are good and that some are bad , and that you try to determine first of all the type of person the new teacher is . In some classrooms , boys and girls have developed signals by which they conmmunicate to each other their idea of the teacher . During the first few weeks with any teacher , they test him to see if he is fair , if he is understanding , if he can be trusted , if he will keep his word and respect confidences . The experiences of some students have led them to look upon school as a game . They see the teacher and themselves as opposing teams , each trying to put over on the other as muchas they can . They see school work as an activity that teachers try to manipulate them into doing . They conceive of themselves as successful when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wish rather than the things they think the teacher wishes . Other youngsters come to school with the conviction that the teacher is a helpful person , concerned with helping boys and girls to grow into more useful citizens . The child whose father or mother is a teacher will have a favorable attitude toward the teachers he meets at school , if his home relationships are satisfactory . And pupils who have found their former teachers 66 What Quality of Human Relations Do We Seek ? lovable and helpful will be favorably inclined to a new teacher , at least until he proves himself an unsatisfactory person . We may expect all these attitudes , and others , in our classes . We may expect to be on trial for the first few weeks with any class . Distrust , antagonism , or hate can be overcome in time if our behavior is satisfactory to pupils . But , by the same token , love and respect for teachers can be dispelled if we are the kind of person who deserves hatred and recrimination . We have an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or an unfavorable attitude toward us . When the group comes together for the first time , we have an opportunity to take positive steps in helping it get organized . In the process , we may or may not win a place in it for ourselves . If we are joining a class that has worked together before , we move into a society and a culture that have already been created . We are a new force in the situation , but we can become effective only as we are accepted by the group . As long as we are outside the group , the attitudes , values , and points of view that will really matter will continue to be those of the members themselves . We may be able to force the group by physical power or by other clubs to accede to our wishes , but mere sere submission will not be effective in improving human relations within the group or the efficiency of the learning situation . If we hope to be accepted as friendly , trustworthy , helpiii , wise , skilled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such acceptance . The human relations in a class are not static . They change with the experiences the children have together . The quality of human relations either improves or deteriorates , and our responsibility is to demonstrate constantly that we value a way of living together in which each person is accepted , respected , id encouraged to achieve . Where Do We Start ? When a class meets for the first time , it brings with it to the classroom the groupings , attitudes , desires , and ways of 67 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations work of the community from which its members come . The background of community living serves as a springboard from which class activities grow . Each class member has a picture of his family 's position in the community . He knows how other people look upon his family ; he knows it from the expressions on their faces when his family 's name is mentioned ; he knows it from the attitudes that other people have displayed in their actions toward the members of his family ; he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he has seen how other women talk down to or play up to his mother ; he has seen his sister accepted or rejected by other girls ; he has seen his brother a part of a team or excluded from it . Each youngster not only has a picture of his own family and its place in the community but he has a knowledge of the position of every other family that he knows . He knows which families have power , which families can exert influence in the church or with the local city government , which families belong to the controlling group of the community , which families are accepted by the community , and which families are rejected by the community . These impressions may not be accurate , but they influence his behavior . They give him confidence or lack of confidence . They move him to aggression , withdrawal , or active participation . Youngsters who are members of privileged groups , formed by parental contacts or by youth organizations , formal or informal , within the community , bring their acceptance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . They also bring their feelings of superiority and lack of consideration for the feelings of non-members as barriers to total group unity . Parenthetically , such handicaps are multiplied when the school has social fraternities and sororities within its organization . Members of the same gang , children who attend the same church , pupils who came from the same rural elementary school to the consolidated high school , members of a minority racial 68 What Quality of Human Relations Do We Seek ? or nationality element of the community may all constitute social groups within a classroom . The pattern varies from community to community . Youth who have been excluded bring then desire to belong as positive inclinations and their resentment and overt aggression toward the more privileged as liabilities to the building of satisfying group relations . But our class differs from a community . It has the advantage of being a frontier where people can meet together in a new environment and develop the type of social organization they find good . As a new social group , we have an opportunity to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationships that bring satisfactions and those that are not as satisfying , and then in terms of those judgments to begin to devise ways of working together that will increase satisfactions for all . SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS 1 . Seek to eliminate personal feelings of inferiority , superiority , or aggression . ( a ) Refuse to allow your feelings to be hurt . ( b ) Never attempt to get even with a child . ( c ) Be willing to lose an issue if it will help an individual or a class . 2 . Be willing for pupils to develop in their own pattern . 3 . Look for the good qualities in pupils . 4 . Have faith in the potential of each pupil . 5 . Be as courteous to pupils as you expect them to be to you . ( a ) Follow the code of behavior established as closely as students are expected to do . 6 . Recognize that all persons have weaknesses . Accept each as lie is. 7 . Encourage each member of the group to contribute his special skills . Work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attempt to help each child feel he belongs , is accepted , is achieving , and is responsible to the group . 69 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations 8 . Seek to develop in pupils a concern for the feelings and welfare of others . 9 . Observe pupil behavior in non-class situations to get clues concerning the quality of human relations in the group . 10 . Involve the class in group activities or projects . 11 . Seek to be accepted by the pupils as a member of the group . 12 . Expect some students , as a result of their past experiences , to dislike and distrust teachers . 13 . Study the social organization of your community . 14 . Have the class make judgments about their satisfaction with existing human relations in the group . 70 Chapter 4 How Can We Improve Human Relations in the Class ? Our basic problem in improving human relations in a class is how to work with the group so that each pupil will feel accepted , at ease , successful , and responsible for helping others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a classroom or society . How Do We Help a Pupil Feel He Is Accepted ? Acceptance for each pupil means that he belongs , that the other members of the group want him , that they are trying to help him rather than to hurt or make fun of him . It does not mean that he is never criticized or told that he is wrong , or even occasionally punished by the group . It means that he feels free to come to the group at any time without being afraid of crowding in or being in the way . He also feels that it is safe for him to leave the group when he wants to . He may be talked about after he is gone , but he knows that the other members will not try to hurt him or deprive him of his rights . He is accepted by the group when he feels " free to come and safe to go . NV ( ' can help pupils to accept each other by accepting each our ourselves . How can we do this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . We learn his ' tame , where he is from , what his parents are like , his background , his likes , his interests , his dislikes , his prejudices , his ambitions . Also , we are careful not to hold his previous behavior against him as we learn more about him . We do not say at 71 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations the first sign of behavior of which we disapprove , " Oh well , that 's all you can expect from a youngster with such a record . " We avoid analyzing the records simply as a means of spotting trouble-makers and choosing allies . Parenthetically , using the records to determine which students we will have to guard against is highly unprofessional . The only valid reason for us to see a pupil 's record is to gain information abort his strengths or weaknesses that will help us determine how we can help him most . Accepting a youngster also means refusing to take advantage of him . Because we have had more experience and have had an opportunity to study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to win . But if we use our advantage unfairly , we destroy whatever progress we have made in winning the confidence of the youngster . Any action of ours that decreases his faith in our sincerity and willingness to help him lessens the opportunity for us to be of real assistance to him . One break destroys the fabric . If a child finds that we have passed along to another teacher something that he has told us in confidence , he will classify us as unreliable if he is charitable , or a dishonest fraud if he has a long-standing distrust of teachers . We show our acceptance of boys and girls by being willing for them to be themselves . When we ask a youngster to be like us or like certain children of whom we approve , we are keeping him from being himself . We are saying to him , " You are n't as good as we are . The only way you can be acceptable is to be like us . " If he happens to have come from a different social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we do . It is impossible for him to have the same beliefs , social graces , prejudices , and values . The following questions may help us to examine our acceptance of people : Are we willing for boys and girls to have different purposes , values , and social skills ? Do we lead our pupils to feel that we are thinking with them and that all of us together , through the 72 How Can We Improve Human Relations in the Class ? process of interaction , are gaining new insight into what constitutes good human relations ? Or do we assume that we alone know what constitutes good human relations ? Are we willing to think with all the members of the class about ways in which everyone working together can help one another to grow ? Do we believe that we can learn from each of our pupils ? Accepting a pupil does not mean that we have to approve of him or of his behavior . It means rather that we want him to have the opportunity to improve , that we try sincerely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes ; that we support him in his belief that he has value and the ability to improve ; that we have faith that he will become more worth while . Accepting a dirty youngster , for example , does not mean that we like his filth . It does not mean t hat we allow him to stay dirty in our class . It means that we do not establish prejudices against him because he is not clean , that we make provisions for him to take baths at school , that we encourage his parents to provide clean clothes for him and to help him stay clean , that we continue to believe he will improve even though he fails numerous times , that we do not isolate him or encourage the other pupils to shame him . We want him to learn to value cleanliness , but we are willing to keep working with him even when he does not respond as readily as we have hoped . In one of the New York City junior high schools , special emphasis was placed on the acceptance of pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was placed in charge of an ungraded group . Children who were not getting along in other classes were allowed to join the group , and others were assigned to it . No child was forced to do anything during the time he was there . Facilities for work and play were provided , 73 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations but the pupils could simply sit if they wanted to . They could say or do anything they pleased as long as they did not harm other pupils . As each child behaved in the way he chose , the teacher studied him and talked with him in order to help him determine the causes of his difficulties and what he really wanted to do . When a pupil felt like working , he did so . When he felt that he was ready to return to the group from which he had come , he was permitted to . The emphasis was on encouraging the child to help himself rather than on trying to change him in accordance with a teacher 's pattern . But the teacher 's acceptance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior harmful to the other children . The remedial treatment applied in helping these pupils reestablish themselves as worthy members of the school was simply the teacher 's acceptance . If all teachers in the school had accepted pupils more fully , the remedial group would not have been necessary . In this school this procedure succeeded where disciplinary action had failed . A major aspect of acceptance is sympathy , the ability to put ourselves in the other person 's role and feel as he does . When we can do this we understand his behavior more fully . We see his aggression or his withdrawal in a different light and have a greater recognition that our role is helping rather than controlling . Understanding the causes of behavior is a part of acceptance . Accepting a pupil also means that we listen patiently to him . His stories about himself and his family may be uninteresting and repetitive . We may have heard similar stories many times before from other pupils . But to accept him means that we listen wholeheartedly to his problems and his concerns . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be new , even though we have been long familiar with the general pattern of his difficulties . 74 How Can We Improve Human Relations in the Class ? We can contribute to our students ' feeling of acceptance in many ways : ( a ) Calling by name . Every person likes the recognition that comes from having his name used . When we call youngsters by other than their first names , we create a situation in which no one is very close to anyone else . We keep up our guard . We restrict the opportunity to move to the type of living relationship with the youngster in which he will feel free to talk through his problems with us. ( b ) Responding to ideas . Listening is not enough . Since learning occurs through the interaction of ideas , our teaching will be made most effective through our thoughtful response to pupil ideas . ( c ) Taking questions seriously . Although some questions seem very naive to us , they are important to the pupils who ask them . Any question seems simple to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Respecting the other person and working with him in such a way that we can help him grow requires that we accept his questions as being worthy of consideration . ( d ) Avoiding ridicule and sarcasm . Respect for human personality is taught by example . If we ridicule individual students , we make clear to all that we do not respect the personalities of children . But by showing proper respect for each child , we increase the chance that the boys and girls with whom we work will respect each other . ( c ) Avoiding action that embarrasses . When we embarrass a pupil , we split the group into two camps . All the menthe s feel that they must take sides . They are forced either to defend the 75 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations injured person or to declare their allegiance to us . Such issues can be avoided if we take the misbehaving youngster aside and talk over with him the effect of his behavior on the group . ( f ) Encouraging friendliness . By complimenting pupils on their acts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( g ) Welcoming children . By welcoming new children into the group , we make it clear that friendliness and belonging are essential qualities of that group . As we plan with the members of our class how we can make new members feel at home , we show that all people belong and are wanted . We assure the newcomers that they arc welcome , and at the same time we increase the security and acceptance of the other children . ( h ) Letting absentees know that they are missed . When absentees know that they have been missed , they feel that they arc making a contribution to the group . But when they return unnoticed , they gain the impression that no one cares whether they are part of the group or not . ( i ) Permitting students to choose their own seats . If we assign seats arbitrarily , we make clear that the room is really our room and that the students are simply doing our bidding . But if we allow students to sit with their friends , we show that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is valued and respected . By separating friends , we make clear that friendship is not a quality that we value in the classroom . The problem of what to do about cliques can be effectively handled after the children have come to recognize friendship as a positive value . Then the problem can be attacked by all the members of the group working together . The solution worked out by this method will be far more satisfactory than when the teacher sets out to destroy the cliques by seating 76 How Can We Improve Human Relations in the Class ? youngsters away from the people they would prefer to sit with . ( j ) Having the class work in committees . As pupils have an opportunity to work closely together in small committees , friendships and sense of belonging increase . ( k ) Stressing common qualities . By emphasizing common interests , we decrease the importance of differences . Group unity is built around common purposes , interests , and beliefs . If differences are stressed , they loom so large that unity is never achieved . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we send a youngster from the room , we decrease his self-respect and isolate him from the group . The effects of such isolation are particularly harmful to children who are already having difficulty getting along with others . The behavior of the adult leader in the group determines to a great degree the pattern of living in the class . If we accept all pupils , we help create the conditions in which pupils will accept themselves and each other . How Do We Help a Pupil Accept Himself ? To be emotionally healthy , every human being must think well of himself . Anyone who undermines a child 's self-respect is not good for that child or society . When we make a child feel that he is unworthy , or that he can not achieve , or that he is an unsatisfactory citizen in our society , we are failing in our responsibilities to him . We are destroying the foundation stone 77 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations of good human relations . We are taking the kind of action that makes it impossible for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure of himself . We build good human relations as we help a pupil accept himself . We help pupils accept themselves by doing the things which aid a pupil to recognize his achievements , decrease his fears , reduce his feelings of guilt , and lessen his financial insecurity . How Do We Help a Pupil Know He Is Achieving ? Many classroom problems in human relations center around the teacher 's concept of leadership . If we believe that a leader is a person who is superior to the other students , our attitude will color all the relationships within the class . Emphasis will be placed on being better than other people . Honor rolls will be posted on the bulletin board , and contests will be held to see which students can make the highest scores . Pupils will be strictly ranked from top to bottom of the class , and each one will know where he stands in the rank order . Emphasis will be placed on becoming a leader by beating someone else . Obviously , such an atmosphere restricts leadership to a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceive of leadership as being any contribution that a boy or girl makes to establishing and carrying out group purposes , everyone has the chance to be a leader . Whenever a student shares a worth-while idea with the group or contributes a skill to the completion of a class project , he will manifest leadership . Everyone is encouraged to lead . Leadership will not he limited to two or three of the more gifted members of the class . All the children will take pride in the things they have done together rather than in the achievement of the superior members of the class . In fact , when leadership is restricted to only a few , the other class members frequently come to resent the activities of the teacher-appointed " elite " rather than take pride in their abilities . Achievement under this broader concept of leadership is an 78 How Can We Improve Human Relations in the Class ? individual affair . To achieve , a pupil does not have to excel others . He is concerned with making better contributions than he has made in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will enable him to determine and evaluate his contribution . We do this by : Helping each pupil and the group as a whole to determine the progress they are making . Procedures for helping pupils to collect evidence of progress will be discussed fully in the section on evaluation . At this point we need only note that it is our function to help each pupil determine his present status , the kind of growth he seeks , and ways of collecting evidence of growth to be used as a basis of judgment concerning the amount and quality of achievement . Evidence of growth is proof of achievement . Giving encouragement at times of failure . All of us fail at times . Despite our best efforts we do not always measure up to the goals that we set for ourselves . We can perform a valuable service to youngsters if we let them know by a word of encouragement that we recognize that the going is tough and that the achievement has not been as great as they had hoped . Making possible many kinds of achievement and recognition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribution , we can assure that the efforts of each pupil will be noticed and valued . Praising youngsters for their accomplishment . None of I ? receives enough praise . Frequently we are criticized for the things that we do not do , with little recognition of our contributions . We can help youngsters to gain a sense of achievement by praising them for the things that they have done well . Varying standards for different individuals . Children 's inclinations and abilities vary greatly . We can not expect to devise a single set of achievement standards that will serve all members of a class . Some students will never experience a sense of achievement simply because they will be 79 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations able to achieve the standards with almost no effort . Others , no matter how hard they try , will never be able to measure up to them . When a youngster has no hope of attaining the standards of achievement that have been established for the group , he begins to despair and to lose interest in his work . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people as leaders and others as inadequate , we decrease the possibility of growth within the class . By using such a procedure , we lead many youngsters to feel that they have no contribution to make . They rebel against a situation and system that make it impossible for them to have a sense of achievement . In a junior high school in Ohio there was a seventh-grade boy who was three years older and much bigger than the other members of his class . Still , he had a hard time keeping up with his classmates in academic activities . Moreover , his family was not well accepted in the community . Because of his size , he was able to excel at athletics and was capable of winning his way in any physical combat that occurred in the school . To compensate for the rejection of his family and his inability to attain the scholastic achievement of other members of his class , he was constantly making fun of the youngsters who were more studious than himself . He belittled all types of academic and social achievement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear a necktie or a white shirt or a coat . He took great joy in hitting and shoving other youngsters who were superior in academic achievement and who did not accept him socially . Refusing the role of an inferior , he began a struggle to achieve a different type of social order in which his particular talents and abilities could function . Since his school and his teacher were inflexible , dropping out of school as soon as he reached the legal age to obtain working papers was the only course open through which he saw an opportunity to maintain his self-respect . His teacher and the school lost the opportunity to contribute to his development as a citizen as soon as he was sixteen . 80 How Can We Improve Human Relations in the Class ? How much of our adult insecurity and mental disturbance is due to a method of measuring achievement under which only a few can feel successful ? A sense of achievement and a feeling of personal worth are closely intertwined . If we want all pupils to develop selfrespect , we will work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are used and acknowledged , where each pupil maintains a record of his own progress , and where judgments are made by pupils , parents , and teacher in terms of standards appropriate to the status and ability of the individual student . If marks , which are only a way of reporting to parents , jeopardize the possibility that all can feel worthy , we face the task of devising new ways of sharing with pupils and parents the evaluation of pupil work . The chapters on evaluation will suggest techniques for helping pupils and parents determine pupil achievement . How Do We Decrease Pupil Fears ? Fear eats away at our sense of personal worth . It decreases Our self-confidence and our trust in others . It forces us into a efensive position and makes constructive forward steps diffiIt . If the fear is great enough it brings regression . Our world is one in which many adults are afraid ? afraid of death , ghosts , atomic bombs , hunger , snakes , high places . The is endless . How much more children face ! They encounter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , they face the special fears associated with their period of develop metn  --  fear about physical changes occurring in themselves , ear f not being normal , fear of being left out , fear of failure . An anecdote reported in the Reader 's Digest tells of a girl who was sitting on a high-school stage in Washington , D.C. , about to give a valedictory address . She was shaking , very much embarrassed and afraid . The man sitting next to her noticed her fright and leaned over and whispered , " I 'm scared tooHe was the principal speaker of the evening , Franklin D. Roosevelt . 81 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations He put the girl at ease by letting her know that he was tense too , but that both of them could go ahead and face the situation that confronted them . We can help pupils by letting them know that we too have concerns , that we understand how they feel , that we are willing to talk over their disturbances with them . Children are less fearful when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , they do n't want help unless they ask for it , but they like to have the assurance that help is there when they need it . We help , moreover , as we assist them to concentrate on solving the problems of the immediate present rather than anticipating the dreadful things that may occur . As we enable them to meet current difficulties successfully they form the strength , courage , and skill to face new problems as they arise . In some cases , preparation for future possibilities , such as fires , or atomic explosions , must be undertaken in schools . But we can use even these grim exercises to build up security and assurance if we conduct them coolly and unemotionally . Protection of youngsters from physical violence is essential to decreasing fear . When smaller pupils are beaten by large ones - or threatened with bodily harm by a pupil gang , we are forced to take action . We may bring the situation to the group for decision if it is within the class . Or the student government may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved are from different groups . As we work with pupils in reaching a solution , our function is to increase the concern of all for their fellows and to encourage older youngsters to assume responsibility for smaller ones . But in the process we do what we must to protect the weak from aggression . Unless we are sensitive , our own behavior may increase pupil fearfulness and insecurity . Do we utilize their fears as an easy means of motivation ? Do we threaten them with failure or with punishment ? Such phrases as , " I do n't want to mention any names , but some of you will repeat this grade next year unless you show improvement , " are destructive threats to the peace of mind of a large proportion of the class . Constant scrutiny of 82 How Can We Improve Human Relations in the Class ? the way we make assignments , counsel , or discuss disorder is essential if we are to keep threats and fear-inciting words from our comments . Being willing to listen and share their concerns , helping solve immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for crises , protecting from physical violence and avoiding the use of fear as motivation , are all steps we can take to decrease pupil fears . How Do We Decrease Pupil Feelings of Guilt ? A person with guilt feelings is unable to believe in his own worth and thus is less secure in his relations with others . If we take action that increases a child 's sense of guilt , we hurt him and hinder the development of good human relations in the class . Guilt is appropriate only when the person who performs an act is aware of the other ways in which he might have behaved . Youngsters are often unaware of these other possibilities and Met in the only way they know to a given situation . Some hers , who do know of alternate ways of behavior , are horand seek to instill in the children a feeling of guilt so that will not behave in such a manner again . Such action is detrimental to the child 's mental health . Making a youngster fed ashamed is appropriate only when he has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation , has decided that some ways are more satisfactory than others , and yet has acted contrary to his decisions . Throughout the consideration of behavior that we think is tisfactory , we can be constructive if we stress the deskits. of examining several courses of action and deciding he is the most intelligent choice . If we help the pupil to see al possible procedures and allow the choice to remain his , provide the opportunity for him to change his behavior and maintain his self-respect . Guilt feelings are decreased as we emphasize a pupil 's soy acceptable behavior . We make a positive contribution to 83 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations his well-being as we help him see within himself the qualities that respected people have . When the emphasis is placed on the qualities that he has that are different and unacceptable , he begins to lose hope that he can become like the respected members of the community and begins to adopt other ways of behaving to get attention . It should be noted that the persons respected vary from community to community and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is finding the kinds of persons all can agree are respected . If we are shocked by a pupil 's activities , language , or dress , we avoid letting him know it . A psychologist and a teacher were walking through an Alabama school . As they passed , a seven-year-old youngster held out a picture that he had drawn , a picture that he considered obscene . The psychologist took it , looked at it , made a passing comment , and handed it back to the youngster . He had not displayed any disgust , any horror , or any indication that the picture was out of the ordinary . I le had not added to the youngster 's guilt-feelings , nor had he given him the satisfaction of knowing that he had been successful in shocking adults . A pupil 's behavior is objective evidence that we use in deciding how we should work with him . Our job is not to judge or to punish , but to study each child and to work with him in such a way that he can grow in self-respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to proceed in a situation , we may ask ourselves this question : " What course of action will give me the best opportunity to work with this child again ? " If our behavior causes a pupil to lose faith in us , to resent us , to fear us , or to feel rejected by us , we have little chance of helping him . When we want help or counsel , we go to the persons who accept us and who have faith in our potentialities . So do pupils ! We increase guilt feelings if we set standards so high that few children attain them . Boys and girls who want to do what is right and socially desirable find themselves unable to do so , 84 How Can We Improve Human Relations in the Class ? through no fault of their own . If we want to . hake it possible for all children to feel worthy , we formulate with them standards suitable to their ability and purposes . We can stress pride in one 's family , nationality , and cultural group . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy because they belong to a minority group of that particular community in which they live , we can take the lead in demonstrating respect for the group and gratitude for the contribution they have made . We can let students know we oppose name-calling and labeling of groups and recommend that they include a prohibition of such action in their code of behavior . How Do We Decrease Insecurity Created by Financial Status ? To the extent that the school emphasizes economic differences among pupils , it increases the insecurity of children whose families do not have economic stability . Recent studies have shown in high schools , particularly , that many hidden costs tend to cause youngsters from lower economic levels to drop out of school sooner than others . Even those who remain $nit themselves handicapped unless we exercise leadership in trill icing the number of situations in which inadequate finances cause a pupil to feel different or embarrassed . We can provide economic assistance without advertising it . it we do provide free lunches or free glasses , or other types of old . students who receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students . Lack of ability to pay is no fault of the youngster , and he should not be penalized by his peers because he does not have the financial backing to purchase all the equipment that is needed in the school . In one school in Ohio , free lunch cards were supplied to youngsters who could not afford to pay for their lunches . But the free lunch cards were while those that were paid for were green . Each time they went through the lunch line , the youngsters who could not it afford lunch were forced to advertise the fact that they were ' different , that they were recipients of charity . The empha-85 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations sis was on pointing out the differences rather than on decreasing them . It is not surprising that a large number of the pupils unable to afford lunch cards chose to stay in the study hall without lunch rather than carry the yellow card through the cafeteria line . Other schools have handled this problem by giving free lunch cards that are exactly like the lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress sensibly and inexpensively . When the youngsters in a class dress in a manner that all can afford , those who come from homes in which money is not plentiful have an opportunity to be working members of the group without feeling the insecurity that comes from having clothing that is not like that of other boys and girls . We can eliminate special Christmas gifts for the teacher . If we teach in a school in which giving presents is the custom , we can insist on being a member of the group and having our name drawn by lot with the same price limit on our present as on the others . We can decrease extra fees . Requiring extra money for papers , laboratory fees , and activity fees emphasizes economic differences . We can assure pupils that economic handicaps can be overcome . By bringing to the class stories and illustrations of youngsters who have succeeded , we increase the belief of each class member that he can achieve success in our American society with or without financial backing . This type of assurance is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We can work with students in such a way that those with superior socio-economic status do not dominate the group . By encouraging all members of the group , no matter what their background is , to use and develop their leadership talents , we build up acceptance of a way of life in which leadership is the reward of ability rather than the prerogative of status . The children will gradually learn that true leadership depends on an individual 's contribution to the group , not on his official or social position . 86 How Can We Improve Human Relations in the Class ? How Do We Help Pupils Accept Each Other ? The third phase of promoting good human relations is to help pupils accept each other . Many times it is more difficult to get persons to accept each other than it is for us to accept them ourselves . If the youngsters come from a community that has sharp cleavages between nationalities , races , and religions , community attitudes of intolerance and distrust are brought into the classroom and affect relations among members of the class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the class study the cultural and national backgrounds of various groups within the class . They have assumed that knowledge and acceptance are synonymous ! Often , however , this procedure has resulted in an overdevelopment of national pride and a heightened antagonism rather than in a greater understanding among the groups , as the teacher had intended . Acceptance is more than gaining knowledge about someone . It develops through recognizing common goals and sharing attempts to reach them . We ca n't tell students what to think of one another . If we by they may decide to act in just the opposite way . A new pupil entered a New York City junior high school from a private school in Chicago . On his way home from school the first day , he was attacked by the boys in class because he had come from Chicago . On the second day , he was beaten by the same group because he had come from a private school . They did not feel that he was a typical American boy and wanted to prove to him that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this particular neighborhood of New York City . A few days later , the class began to discuss how wool was produced . The new boy , having been in the Midwest where sheep were raised , knew much about the subject . In the class discussion , when he had an opportunity , he described the shearing process . After he had finished , the teacher called him to the front of the room in an obvious attempt to help him gain acceptance in the group . She put her 87 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations arm around his shoulders and commended him highly for having contributed so much to the class from his study and experience . On the way home that afternoon the boy was once again slugged by his fellow classmates because of the teacher 's demonstration of approval . By such an obvious attempt to direct the attitudes of the class , the teacher succeeded only in increasing the new boy 's isolation . However , by proceeding carefully and sensitively , a teacher can often arouse the concern of the class for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group . A new youngster from out-of-state joined a first-grade class in a Florida elementary school . It was a large school , over a thousand children , and the boy was insecure in the new situation . He found a type of teaching that was strange to him . Ile was permitted less freedom and was expected to remain more quiet than had been customary in the kindergarten that he had attended . He rebelled . He began to play hookey . He was absent three days in a row . Finally , the teacher decided that she would try to improve the situation for this one boy . She approached the problem by inviting the class to help work out the solution . While the new boy was still absent , she asked the other children to think about what they could do to help him feel at home in the class . They responded to her appeal . In their attempts to help , they succeeded in developing better human relations among all members of the group . The new boy was made to feel welcome and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new awareness of the feelings of other people led to a classroom situation that was more satisfying for them all . The class can not function effectively as a group if any of its members are emotionally disturbed . Strong emphasis during the early stages of class activity on the effective functioning of the group will help students to become concerned about the welfare of others . One way of helping pupils understand how the other person 88 How Can We Improve Human Relations in the Class ? feels is to have them play out the incidents of conflict within their group . Two third-grade boys started an argument over a cowboy lasso . Soon other youngsters gathered around and began to encourage each of the protagonists to stand up for his rights . Both boys , beginning to feel that their honor and the honor of those yelling for them were at stake , crowded closer together until one accidentally touched the other . The fight was on . The teacher came around the corner of the building , saw the struggle , walked over , took each boy by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happening . Through their tears , for both had become angry and hurt , each told his story . Other pupils added bits of information . The teacher asked the boys if they would try an experiment . When they agreed , perhaps as a way of avoiding punishment , the class was requested to sit down in a circle and then the teacher asked the fighters to go back to the beginning of the disagreement . She had them trace the development of the argument up to the point when the first blow had been struck . She had each boy tell how he felt at each stage of the argument and also asked the bystanders to describe their feelings . Then the teacher asked each boy to play the role of his opponent while they went through the scene again . Once more the boys were asked to tell how they felt , but this time each was finding out how his opponent had felt . The entire group joined in the discussion and sought to suggest how a fight could have been avoided in a way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique described is a simple form of a psycho-drama. u , participants in the real-life situation act out their roles the play situation and interpret their feelings . After each has ye d his own part , the roles are reversed and each person the part of his opponent . Iv role-playing can be carried a step further by having two r pupils play the same roles . Each pupil is asked to explain 89 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations his feelings and his emotional reactions as the situation develops . Seeing the dispute acted out in this way , the original participants become aware of factors in the situation that they had not recognized before . They gain a greater understanding of how the other person felt . They have a chance to see themselves as others see them . When all the members of the group have shared in one another 's emotional reactions , they are ready to suggest more effective ways of dealing with similar problems . Then these suggestions of better ways of behaving can be acted out , and the whole class will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations problem . At the high-school level a social studies class , studying labor management relations , staged the following socio-drama . The son of a manufacturer was cast in the role of a labor leader and the son of a union member played the role of an industrial leader in a negotiation situation . Both pupils , as well as the rest of the class , gained insight through their roles into the values and techniques of groups toward which they might not formerly have been sympathetic . Evidence continues to mount that the simple acquisition of facts does not promote understanding . We attain understanding as we have opportunities to experience as fully as possible the reactions of others in given social situations . The alert teacher will seek constantly to devise ways of helping his students to feel and to respond to social situations in roles other than those to which they are accustomed . If we assume that nothing can be done to help people learn to understand each other , little progress is made . If , on the other hand , we give students an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whom they usually disagree , social sensitivity is increased through a widening of experience . From these first steps in becoming concerned about others , members of the class can gradually move on to a real understanding of one another . They will develop this understanding 90 How Can We Improve Human Relations in the Class ? through sharing experiences , through bringing hobbies and personal projects to class , through taking part in social activities , and through talking out together individual and group problems . As they share their interests , they will begin to accept and to want to help one another . When people share , they are , not only about the outcome of a particular project but bout the people who have been involved in making the project successful . How Do We Encourage Pupils To Help Each Other ? As indicated in the story of the first-grade boy who entered a new school , one aspect of accepting another person is being concerned about his welfare and being willing to help him . We i promote a desire to help each other in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we work . If we want pupils to help each other , we provide many opportunities for them to work , play , and think together . We use class committees . We suggest that pupils undertake projects together . We recommend that less skilled pupils ask the more skilled to help them . In a Michigan high school an English workshop has been established . Student volunteers from the study hall come to the workshop and serve as coaches and counselors for other students desiring help with their English work . Students are encouraged to help each other ? not penalized or punished for doing so . 91 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations This practice can be utilized in our classrooms . The more advanced pupils can be of service to the other students if we encourage them to help . And the roles will change constantly . One student will be superior in one area while another will lead in a different phase of the work . We also promote a sense of responsibility for each other by encouraging children to share . When we invite them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , problems , joys , successes , and sorrows , they increase their concern for each other . Time spent in " show and tell " or other types of sharing periods serves a real purpose in developing pupil interest in each other as well as opening up areas for more intensive study . Using class time for the sharing of problems when they desire it is a way of increasing pupils ' willingness to help each other . At first , pupils may hesitate to bring their concerns to the group ? particularly if they are older boys and girls . We make it easier for them to seek the help of the group if we let them know that we do n't have all the answers either , that we are still seeking for answers to problems in our own life , some that are recurrent and some that are new . When pupils understand that we are still facing and attempting to solve problems , they are freer to share their concerns . As we open the class period for pupils to use in seeking solutions to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of ridicule , we are taking positive steps to create the type of situation in which the group members begin to seek help from each other . We further stimulate pupils to help each other if , during the evaluation conferences we hold with individual students , we ask such questions as : Which students have been most helpful to you ? Why ? What materials have you brought for others to use ? Which students have you helped ? What have you done to help the class ? What additional things could you have done to help each other ? 92 How Can We Improve Human Relations in the Class ? In the classroom we have the opportunity to share in the creation of an environment where the pattern of living is such that people are valued because they help one another . The values we accept grow out of the way we live day by day . What Is Our Out-of-Class Responsibility in Improving Human Relations ? Our concern can not stop with how well youngsters accept one another in the classroom , however . The school is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is determined in large measure by the quality of community living . If hatred , prejudice , and conflict are dominant characteristics of the community , the learning that pupils acquire from participation in the Community will contradict and perhaps outweigh what they learn in the classroom situation . If we are genuinely concerned with improving human relations , we will take steps to cooperate with others in the community who are working for the same gout . Our first step in working for improved human relations outside the classroom is to encourage the faculty of the school to 1w concerned with the improvement of community living . In faculty meetings we advocate that the school become a community school with the facilities and personnel of the school available as community resources . No teacher can work effectively alone . His contribution becomes significant when all the members of the faculty begin to show concern for community improvement . 93 Teaching Is Skill in Human Relations Second , we become a participant in community organizations and community councils dedicated to the welfare of the age-group with which we are working . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the problems of youth , the educational environment improves and the work of the school is supplemented and enhanced . No longer does theschool compete with the educational experiences of youngsters in out-ofschool situations . Third , we increase the opportunity for our pupils to participate in community activities and analyze the human relations found . 1 f students have the kind of experiences which involve observing and participating in community activities as a part of their school work and analyze these experiences and draw their own conclusions , living in both the community and the school can be improved . The important features are student experiencing and student analysis . We help people improve their values and human relations through their analysis of ways of living and the values implicit in them . SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS 1 .

Encourage the faculty to become concerned about improving human relations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the generalizations they have drawn about human relations to the organization and operation of the community . 39 . Participate in community organizations working for welfare of the age-group taught . 96 Chapter 5 How To Use Group Work out of our greater understanding of human development and t he learning process has come a recognition of the importance ) I group work in the classroom . We know that effective group processes create a healthy emotional climate , increase the pupil 's enjoyment and sense of belonging , make it possible for pupils to learn from one another , and teach important democratic skills . Efficient learning for pupils depends upon our skill III group work . Effective use of group procedures requires an understanding -f group work , a willingness to work with pupils , an ability to win the acceptance of pupils , and a knowledge of the pitfalls of group work . What Is Group Work ? Effective group work means working in a group ? not on it ! long as we conceive of our function as directing students to . I. , what we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. When we use group work , we become a member of the group ax quickly as we can . We invite students to share the planning with us . We seek the establishment of common purposes . We develop an organization through which students can participate in the administration of the class . We stimulate the emergence of other leadership . We encourage each member to ac'pt other members and to feel a responsibility for helping then ) . We bring all members in on the evaulation of activities and accomplishments . Teaching Is Skill in Group Work In a real group situation , everyone participates in both the planning and in the evaluation . We may suggest things that might be done and possible ways of doing them , but the final decisions rest with the total group , including us as teacher . Students look upon us as just another member of the group , with voting power but not veto power . The way we work with the group determines how much respect and authority our viewpoints and suggestions will command . Ordinarily , pupils will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do n't expect to . Only through a period of encouragement can we get boys and girls who have been conditioned to teacher domination to move to the place where they are willing to say , " This is what seems important to me in terms of my purposes and in terms of what I hope to become . " A class becomes a group as it recognizes common interests and establishes common purposes . When teacher purposes and pupil purposes conflict , no group exists . When individuals within the class do not agree on the activities to be undertaken or the achievement sought , a group has not emerged . The use of " we " is an indication of group feeling . But when the members of a class continue to say " I " did this , or " I " will do that , they are still thinking in exclusively individual terms . When we have helped the class achieve the feeling that " we " are going to do this and " we " are going to do that , groupness has begun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil participation in the policy-making and the administration of the class . As long as we preside at all class meetings , establish the schedule , appoint all committees , direct all activities , make decisions about materials , procedures , and work locations , and judge all products , group work is not under way . It is teacher direction of a class ? pure and unadulterated . In a true group situation , the leadership shifts . Although at the beginning it may rest largely with the teacher , as the group grows more mature and becomes more definite in its direction 1 ut ) How To Use Group Work and plan of action , the leadership will shift from person to person in accordance with the contributions that various members of the group can make . Anyone who contributes to the improvement of the group or to the achievement of group purposes becomes at the moment of making the contribution the leader of the group . We accept this fact and promote its acceptance by the students . Group work makes possible many types of leadership . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of the teacher , only a few pupils can lead . The others are forced into following roles . The only acceptable type of leadership is that which contributes to carrying on the project which the teacher has chosen . But as we move into genuine group work , many types of contributions can be accepted . Once the class has agreed on a project , several groups may be working simultaneously on various phases of it . More pupils have an opportunity to serve in the capacity of leaders.In group work , members accept one another and assume a responsibility for the success of all group members . A class Where pupils are trying to be successful at the expense of others it : lot a group . A class divided into conflicting factions is not a pimp . In a group situation cooperation is encouraged . Boys and girls are encouraged to think together about what can be done and how it should be done . Each is encouraged to consider the contribution that he can make to the group and its members . Croup work involves participation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the teacher alone decides 101 Teaching Is Skill in Group Work whether the procedures used have been good and the results satisfactory , group work is incomplete . Let 's look at the way group work functions in a class . A sophomore biology class in a southern high school was discussing diseases . They found that 50 per cent of the class had had malaria . Shocked , they decided to undertake a study of the disease , its causes and possible preventive measures . At first , the teacher assumed leadership in defining the problem and in suggesting various methods of attack . After talking the project through , the numbers of the class decided that they would begin interviewing various citizens in the town in order to get the facts on the extent of malaria in their town ? the health department slid not have the information . One student , who was skills d in the communication arts , volunteered to help train the interviewers iii the most effective techniques of ( hawing forth information . When the interviewers had returned with their findings , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for organizing the data into a meaningful pattern . Another student , interested in politics , suggested that they should make their findings known and recommended submitting them to the city council . After discussing the desirability of such a step , the class decided that it was a good idea . But first , they felt , the material would have to be prepared for effective presentation . At this point , other students , with experience in drawing and lettering , offered to work out graphs and illustrations of the group 's conclusions and proposals . Then the students selected their most eloquent speaker to make the actual presentation to the council . After the council had listened but taken no action , the teacher raised the questions that caused the group to evaluate the results of their efforts . All during this project , one student after another had assumed leadership as successive group needs became evident . The teacher stood ready to offer assistance , but his greatest contribution had been in helping the group to uncover and develop its own potentials for leadership . 102 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon group decision and division of work . A sixth-grade class was studying various theories of the origin of the earth . As long as the study was limited to reading books and listening to the teacher 's explanations , only a few pupils were really enthusiastic . But when the class decided to portray the theories in a " movie " made of a roll of wallpaper , a box , and two broomsticks , all the students became deeply interested . Some prepared the script . Others laid out the rough sketches on the back of the wallpaper . Some painted the pictures . Some measured and cut the box and fitted the broomsticks . All were giving their best to make the project successful . All were involved in some aspect of the group undertaking . All were learning . All evolved some theory of the earth 's formation , along with other learnings . No two pupils learned the same things . That would be impossible ! Group work increases the opportunities for all pupils to learn . different stimuli are meaningful to different people . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have significance for another . We increase the chance for all to learn by increasing the variety of stimuli present in a situation . As we recognize that individuals , because of different backgrounds , get their motivation and their learning from different pus of interactions and experiences , we see the desirability of creating the type of situation in which the number of inter- 103 Teaching Is Skill in Group Work actions will be multiplied . As we move from a teacher-dominated situation where the dialogue is **26;227;TOOLONG to a group-centered situation where the interaction may be between any members of the group , the possible interactions are multiplied . Some teachers feel that they are promoting group work when they divide the class into groups that work by themselves . In the elementary school particularly , many teachers have believed that group work consists of dividing the class into certain reading-level groups , perhaps named the " Blackbirds , " the " Bluebirds , " and the " Bluejays . " While the teacher is hearing one group read aloud , the other students read silently at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phase of the school program . This teaching method does not bring into play all the possibilities and values of true group work . It does not encourage students to develop a feeling of belonging , a feeling of accepting , or a feeling of helping other people . It does not develop self-direction or self-control . It is simply a device that enables the teacher to keep a certain number of students quiet while he works with the others . This practice may be necessary but it is not group work . In summary , we are not using group work when we manipulate people to get them to do what we want . We are still the one who has the purposes and the responsibilities . Dictation to the group or manipulation of the group are unsatisfactory group procedures and inefficient teaching . First , they oppose the concept of democracy as a way of living . We ca n't expect boys and girls to learn democracy as they live within a dictatorship in the classroom . Second , domination by the teacher weakens , rather than strengthens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the decisions for them , we are denying them the chance to grow . We weaken every other member of the group as we cause them to be more and more dependent upon us . We help them grow most when we provide the situation where they can take more responsibility . Neither are we using group work when we work for a class . 104 How To Use Group Work If we have no voice in decision-making and confine our activities to running errands and collecting materials , we are not a full-fledged group member . If we accept this role , we are in the position of not exerting leadership . We revert to a servant 's status with only a servant 's chance of being able to help the people grow . But when we work within the group , we share decision making , responsibility , and the authority we have . We establish working relationships with boys and girls that make it possible for them to assume responsibility for their own growth and selfdirection . And , at the same time , we retain our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Pupils Do We Want ? Sharing leadership with children may seem to be a dangerous and difficult undertaking . We do n't want to lose the respect of pupils . We do n't want the class to run wild , without control . What kind of relationship between teacher and pupils permits shared leadership and shared authority ? What kind of working relationship with pupils do we want ? One step in deciding how we want to work with pupils is to identify some of the relationships that we do not want to establish with them . We do n't want them to do things simply because we tell then ' to . If we tell students to do something that turns out unprofitably or unsuccessfully , they blame us . If we initiate every project , we must expect to be held responsible for the ultimate success of every project . And , as stated previously , such behavior on our part robs pupils of the opportunity to mature . By jealously guarding the right to make decisions we cut them off torn the experiences that will permit them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be afraid of us . Children who fear U. can not learn efficiently with us because they are afraid to fell us the kinds of help that they need . They are afraid to make 105 Teaching Is Skill in Group Work the mistakes through which they can grow , because they fear that we will not understand , that we will not be helpful , that we will punish them . Fear is a motivating force , but it is not the kind of motivation that makes it possible for the person who engenders it to provide guidance for the individual involved . The teacher who motivates by fear can only serve as a driving force ; he can not help youngsters explore and resolve the conflicts that exist within them . Neither do we want a situation in which students are controlling us . We have a responsibility for the way in which a class is conducted . If we permit certain students in the class to gain con trol of the situation and tell us what to do , we abandon that responsibility . We can no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want a situation in which students are in opposition to us . When students line up against us , we are in the position of having to win , and when we have to win we decrease our chances of working with the people that we defeat . Defeated persons may resent and even hate the winner . As the classroom situation becomes one of struggle between us and the students , it is not one that is conducive to students ' analyzing with us the types of help that they need , nor does it provide the experiences that will bring about desired improvement . It becomes , instead , a situation in which we use all the manipulative techniques that we have at our command to get students to do the things that we believe are important to do . 106 How To Use Group Work It becomes a battlefield and a game to see which one can put something over on the other . These are relationships , then , that we do n't want to develop . Let 's turn now to other ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work in situations marked by mutual trust and respect , in which we believe in the worth of the students , and they in turn believe in our good faith and abilities . We want a situation in which pupils and teacher help each other , where they talk out problems together and can depend upon each other . We want the classroom to be a place in which everyone will feel free to share ideas , materials , and problems . How can we develop bitch a working relation-ship ? Suggestions for achieving desirable relationships have been made in the chapters dealing with human relations in the classroom . Additional recommendations will be made in the remainder of this chapter and the two following . How Much Faith Is Necessary ? One of the functions of leadership is to have faith in the people who comprise the group . Sometimes it 's hard for a teacher 10 have such faith . It 's hard to see how a group of boys and arts who have not had previous experience in self-direction , 107 Teaching Is Skill in Group Work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any worth-while purposes or values , can be persons in whom we can have faith . But faith is necessary . If we do n't believe in them , we can never expect them to believe in themselves . How much faith must we have ? We must believe that each student in our class is important . This is a basic faith in democracy . Denial of the importance of each student is a denial in practice of our belief in democracy . We must believe that each child has a potential contribution to make . Otherwise , we will find ourselves shutting him out or ignoring Mini or doing the things in the class that will cause the other students to leave him out or to ignore his contributions . It is our job to search for each youngster 's contribution as we guide and plan with him . We must believe that each child has worth-while purposes . Boys and girls are human beings with the drives and the instincts that other human beings have . They have some purposes that are judged good in our society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The classroom provides us with the opportunity to help boys and girls to implement their socially acceptable purposes . They will make mistakes along the way , of course . Otherwise , schools would be unnecessary . We imist believe , too , that each child can improve . Unless we believe that improvement is possible , education becomes a farce . We must believe that if we have sufficient skill , we can help the child to improve his values , his ways of working , and his skill in living with others . We must believe that each pupil wants to belong and will work with others as soon as he feels that he does belong . As far as we can determine , it is a basic aspect of human nature to want to be a part of the social group . When we realize that a child is sincere in his attempts to win membership in the group , our teaching will become a process of helping him discover the most effective techniques . We will certainly not lose faith in him when he first enters our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . 108 How To Use Group Work We must believe that boys and girls can be trusted . People tend to live up to what other people expect of them . If we show distrust of a child , we encourage him to become untrustworthy . But if we believe in his trustworthiness , we set standards that make it very difficult for him to deny the faith we have in him . We must believe that each student will live up to the best that he knows . We can be sure of this . No student wants to be labeled " unsatisfactory . " Often he will do things that appear unsatisfactory simply because he does not know the most satisfactory means of achieving his goals . One of our functions is to help him set higher standards for himself , to help him develop concepts of the good life that will cause him to aim a little higher than when he first came to the class . These are the essential faiths of an effective teacher in the purposes and potential of the pupils with whom he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Us ? Many teachers are not accepted by the classes with which they work . And they do n't care . They do n't believe acceptance h important . All they are concerned about is that pupils do as they are told and remain relatively quiet . When they have achieved this " discipline " and when their classes do the assigned work , these teachers feel that they are successful . Obviously , we can not stop at such a low level of acceptance if we are to be effective teachers . It is not by chance that youngsters In such classes fight on their way home and tease their more vulnerable classmates . They are simply turning the aggression they feel toward their teacher against their fellow students . The pupils ' refusal to share their problems and concerns with 11 .. teacher is another characteristic of such situations . When a tea ( her states that neither he nor his class has any problems or Tics , he is revealing that he is so far outside the group that pupils are afraid to trust him . All children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not think that adults are concerned or when adults refuse to listen or attempt to control their behavior and thinking by force or sarcasm . Stu-109 Teaching Is Skill in Group Work dents do n't reveal their really important experiences to the teacher in such an atmosphere . If we want our teaching to make a real difference in the lives and behavior of pupils , we must establish the kind of relationship with them that makes it possible for them to trust us , to confide in us , to argue with us , and to question us . They must accept us as a person who likes them , is concerned with their problems , is willing to plan with them , has faith in them , wants them to be happy , shares successes and disappointments with them , and recognizes their mistakes for what they are . In short , we must work with them rather than try to direct them into our preconceived patterns . How To Win Group Acceptance As we walk into a classroom for the first time , we are " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group , especially if we are new in the system and the students have had no reports from their predecessors about what kind of person we are . Of course , if we have taught in the school before , our chances for success are either enhanced or decreased by the reputation we 've made for ourselves . If previous students have found us to be a satisfactory person to work with , our task of of winning the acceptance of a new group will not be hard . But if we have a name for being a nagger , a disagreeable person , a tyrant , or an inefficient worker , our hopes for winning acceptance by the group are greatly decreased . As we undergo this first trial , we find that certain things may hinder our winning acceptance by the class . If we attempt to bluff our way by being very strict and by making an example 110 How To Use Group Work of the first pupil who steps out of line , we create an undesirable relationship that we will have to overcome later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing the students ' respect . Students welcome evidence of the teacher 's willingness to be friendly but they resent synthetic , elaborate displays of friendship . They know that friendship develops as a result of shared experiences that bring about mutual respect . In beginning to work with students , we should attempt to create the kind of situation in which they will feel free to express their personal reactions . As people are free to say what they think , their comments will guide us in deciding on what steps we should take to win acceptance in the group . Boys and girls must feel that they have independence . This 1s particularly true at the high-school age . Whenever we attempt to crowd students into accepting our plans , we force them either to abandon their self-respect or to rebel . If we draw he battleline so that rebellion is the only respectable course , we ca n't win acceptance by the group . We may win respect used on fear , but we wo n't be accepted as a member of the group . If we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must begin to work with the class in such a way we make clear to them at the class is theirs , as well as ours , that we want help in planning how class experiences can be conducted most effectively . We can not win acceptance unless we have faith in the youngsters with whom we work . Acceptance means mutual and faith on the part of students does not come until we vc shown them that we have the faith in them described previously . This faith can be shown in numerous ways . It is demon.t rated by expecting the best from students as we begin to 111 Teaching Is Skill in Group Work work with them , by refraining from making comments about unsatisfactory past performance , by looking for the good things they do rather than for things to stop them from doing , by encouraging them to work together rather than attempting to isolate them from each other , by allowing them to sit and work with the people they like to work with . Faith is the most powerful tool we have in winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way along . A Florida teacher met a class for the first time . He noticed that there was a great deal of confusion and disorder , but he made no point of it . Finally , he raised a question with the class , and one of the students said , " Do n't you know that were the most unruly class in the school ? Has n't anyone told you that we 've had that reputation ever since we were in the fifth grade ? " The teacher sat quietly for a moment and then said , " Is this a challenge ? " The students looked back and laughed . Then one of them said , " No , we just want to tell you so you wo n't he too discouraged . " That 's an example of what happens when a school tags certain classes with a reputation . Students feel that they have to live up to that reputation as soon as they meet with a new teacher for the first time . But the situation also illustrates the way a class tests a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them or against them , whether he was going to attack , become frightened , or try to be friendly . Students need to be able to look to us for the kind of friendly help they would get from their parents . Parents do not condemn their children because they do not measure up to some artificial standard ; they accept their children as the best possible children and then work with them in moving in the direction that both parents and children feel is important . If we want to be accepted as working members of the team , we must make it possible for students to work with us without having their personality violated . Students must find in working with us the kind of experience that allows them to be themselves , to think their own thoughts , to maintain their own integ-112 How To Use Group Work city , and to develop in terms of the things they think are Important . We lose any chance of working successfully with a class when we allow ourselves to be drawn into a struggle for domination with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a class that we are taking issue with a given student . If it does , we create the type of situation in which one must win . Rather , we should take steps that throw the responsibility for judging what should be done about problems back onto the total class . When a student creates a problem by challenging Us , as some students are certain to do , it becomes a problem for group solution rather than one for us to solve by ourselves . I f we assume that we alone should give the answer , then it . comes a question of whether we can enforce it , whether the her students will accept it as better than that of the aggresve student who has challenged us . We can not engage in a rson-to-person quarrel with a student and expect to retain up acceptance ; the student group as a whole will automat- . Hy be on the side of their age-peer . More basically , such acn on our part will interfere with the learning of all the stuts in the class . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the group decisions on appropriate action . we raise the question with students as to what is the most portant thing to do and what is the best way to do it , the c of who will decide what is to be done will never arise . We e toward acceptance by making the issue what is right tiler than who is right . We increase our chance of being accepted by learning someng about the pupils and their families . When we know that brother is a quarterback on the football team , that big sister helped organize the school intercultural council , we indie to pupils that they and their families are important to us. our comments reveal our knowledge and interest , we move step toward acceptance . We decrease our acceptance , howr , if we use a sister 's or a brother 's record as a threat or prod . 113 Teaching is Skill in Group Work We move toward acceptance more quickly by learning the names of students . If we are careless or slow in learning them , we are saying brutally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who they are , that they are n't even important enough for us to learn their names . By familiarizing ourselves with the interests , purposes , desires , and experiences of each pupil we are once again manifesting to them that they are important to us . As they become important to us , we become important to them . We will acceptance more easily by avoiding such statements as , " This is what I want you to do , " " I have decided that we are going to begin this way . " Rather , we should proceed by asking pupils , " What is the best way to work together ? " " What are the next steps for us to take ? " As pupils share decisions with us , they come to accept us . Through the process of sharing decisions we win group acceptance . Whether we continue to enjoy the acceptance of the group depends upon whether or not we live up to our responsibilities to the group . If we ignore the decisions that we have shared with the group , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans and policies that have been made together , we lose the ground that we have gained . Acceptance by the group on one occasion does not guarantee life membership . Acceptance is a dynamic condition ; it grows either stronger or weaker . Our day-to-day behavior either helps us to develop whatever acceptance we have won or else it decreases that acceptance . What Are the Pitfalls in Group Work ? Teachers with wide experience in working with groups have pointed out certain pitfalls that can be avoided . One of the most common pitfalls is not establishing a definite 114 How To Use Group Work agenda . If the group does not plan ahead and establish an agenda for itself , chaos may result . The students develop a hopeless sense of drifting . They have no landmarks by which they can ascertain progress . They lose their sense of direction . But simply setting up an agenda is not enough . An agenda does not give the course of action ; it only states the topics that are to be taken up . Before a class undertakes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlines a procedure to be followed and specifies the responsibility of individual students . In the early grades this may be a very informal plan . The children will say , " These are the things we are going to do . John will collect the paints . Mary will water the flowers . " But at the high-school level , the plan needs to be a written , step-by-step statement of the procedures to be followed , the results expected from each group , and the various responsibilities of each student . Some teachers neglect to work out effective means of keeping posted on the progress of each work-group . When there are five or six groups working in a class , we need to know what where we can be of Est help . As we move from group to group , we need some rely method of reminding ourselves just what each group is ping at any given time . The work plans of the various comIttees will usually provide the necessary information . They cable us to provide more help to each group by permitting us enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skill in Group Work standing . The plan of a work-group enables us to determine quickly what progress has been made . By checking the number of steps that have been taken and the number still to be taken and by comparing the status of one group with the status of other groups in the class , we collect the information that enables the planning committee to coordinate the class activities . If we do n't have this information , we are unable to help the group as a whole to coordinate itself . Another danger is failure to set up definite lines of responsibility and planning authority . Everybody 's business is nobody 's business . The direction of group activity will return to us by default unless definite lines of responsibility have been established . A plan that some classes have found helpful is to establish a coordinating committee ? sometimes called a planning committee or an executive committee ? which meets frequently , perhaps every day , for a few minutes to talk through what is being done and what needs to be done to implement the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into work-groups . Another difficulty that some teachers encounter is how to establish ways for the various groups to share their experiences with one another . The conclusions reached by one work-group may be very valuable to other members of the total class group . If some channel of communication has been established , perhaps through an executive or planning committee , it can serve as a clearing house for the sharing of information among groups . Such a committee can also arrange for the temporary halting of work in the various groups while progress is being shared . Some teachers have insured the failure of group work by attempting to force the class to work on a project which it does not accept . We should not delude ourselves on this point . Pupils will work as a group only on projects that they accept as important . In group work pupils communicate with each other and express how they feel . They establish ways of combating us if we are forcing them to do something in which they 116 How To Use Group Work do not believe . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( : roup work has a chance of succeeding only as the teacher and the class are working on things which all consider important . Almost as disastrous is an attempt on our part to make the group stick to our preconceived plans . Since group work means bringing pupils in on the planning , the original plans that we have worked out can not possibly remain intact as the work gets under way . And even the plans that the group makes for self must undergo constant revision in terms of the thinking of everyone who has a part in the project . Group work involves the sharing of the creative intelligence of all members . If the pupils do not accept the work , they ill reject it . And in the process , they will also reject us . Group work is often facilitated by simple physical arrangements ? the way in which the furniture is arranged , for example . When we keep the chairs arranged so that all the members face in our direction , we decrease the possibilities of real group work . Group work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture must be arranged so that they can see one another and work together . Another pitfall pointed out by teachers experienced in group rk is the failure to bring pupils into the record-keeping . If pupil is to know where he stands at a given moment , he must able to refer to some sort of record of what he has done . is need becomes even greater when pupils are participating decision-making and planning . If we keep all the records selves , pupils are asked to plan without sufficient data . up work demands methods by which both the individual d the group can keep records of progress . Procedures for record keeping will be discussed fully in Chapter 10 . Some teachers fail to help the group feel a sense of achievement . This is closely related to the preceding point . When dents are directing their own activities , they need to feel t they are making progress . Otherwise , they will become discouraged and will react negatively to their experience . To Teaching Is Skill in Group Work prevent this breakdown of morale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt , to falter , or to lose sight of their purposes . If students are brought into the record-keeping , they know where they stand and they can see the progress they are making . If , in addition , the group from time to time analyzes what it has done , where it has gone and what achievement it has made , high morale is maintained . As people can see that they are achieving , they gain confidence in themselves and they become enthusiastic about what they are doing . With our greater insight into what group progress really means , we can often help youngsters sec the progress they have made when they themselves can not see it . They do not always recognize the evidence they have . If from time to time we take a few minutes to think with the group , to state with it the steps that have been successfully completed , the chance that the group work will be successful becomes much greater . Other teachers fail to discuss with students how fast their progress should be . The students share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they have no clear idea of how soon it should be done . Their students lose an extra factor of security . All of us are controlled by the things that we have to do , whether it is a task set up for us or whether it is a task we set up for ourselves to be completed by a certain time . In the planning process in a group situation we help youngsters if we take the time not only to establish the things to be done and the procedures to be followed , but also to reach an agreement on the time in which this work will be completed . If this agreement upon deadlines is a part of total group planning , individuals and small work committees within the class will have a responsibility to the total class to complete their work by a certain date . An agreement of the group is even more rigorous in holding 118 How To Use Group Work ungsters to a firm work schedule than is any deadline estabLlwd by the teacher . Students find it easier to tell us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than they do to tell their classmates that they have not completed work by the time that they agreed on . As a group has the authority to establish its own purposes , Inns , and deadlines , it assumes responsibility for the successcompletion of the task undertaken . Sharing in a decision is a process of assuming responsibility . SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS 1 . Work in a group , not on it or for it . 2 . Seek agreement on goals . 3 . Propose an organization through which all can participate in planning . 4 . Be willing to share the leadership of the group . 5 . Have faith that each pupil is important , can make a contribution , has worth-while purposes , can improve , wants to mg , can be trusted , and will live up to the best he knows . 6 , Allow students to express their personal reactions . 7 . Look for the things a class does well . 8 , Encourage students to work together on projects . 9 . Avoid a struggle for domination with aggressive pupils . Ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . s what is right rather than who is right . 11 . Avoid use of " I want you to ? . " 119 Chapter 6 How Can We Help a Class Become a Group ? A class may become a group , but a group does n't exist merely because a school assigns a number of youngsters to work in the same classroom . A group is born ; it emerges when a number of individuals reach some common goals and some common plans . We perform our function in promoting groupness as we help the class : form a working organization ; discover and use its latent leadership ; develop maturity ; ascertain progress ; improve morale ; increase unity ; and determine the role of the individual in the group . How Do We Help a Class Form a Working Organization ? The transformation of a roomful of children into a group is a difficult process . Students must decide that group purposes may be more important than their own individual purposes ? a decision that never comes easily . The class seems to bog down for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting anywhere . They may turn back to us and ask us what we want them to do . We should recognize this step for what it is , gear-shifting , one operation in the transfer of control and responsibility from us to the group . When pupils ask us to tell them what to do , they are using a technique for avoiding the necessity for giving up individual purposes in order to achieve common purposes . As long as we are the person in authority and give the directions , the indi-120
