As might be expected , the Archbishop of Canterbury is against sin , but he is against it in a special way . Last week Dr. Geoffrey Francis Fisher added his voice to the growing body of British opinion in favor of the Wolfenden Report ( TIME , Sept. 16 ) , which recommended that 1 ) homosexuality between consenting adults no longer be considered a crime , and 2 ) that since little could be done about the prostitutes that swarm over London , perhaps their fines should be increased to 10 ( $28 ) for a first offense . Dr. Fisher 's reason for giving the report his qualified endorsement : he approves of the document 's implicit distinction between sin ( the concern of religion ) and crime ( the concern of the law ) . <P> Wrote Dr. Fisher in the monthly Canterbury Diocesan Notes : " Sin is an offence against God . Its measurements do not vary from age to age as man 's laws do ... So then , whatever from time to time the criminal law may say , homosexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life of sin ; the men , many of them regarded by themselves and others as reasonably respectable citizens and certainly not criminals , who add their own sin to the sin of the prostitute are sinners ... A crime is a different matter , a sin against society and social order of such a kind that the law has to take note of it . " <P> The archbishop seemed to separate man-made law from moral or natural law in a way that some theologians would disagree with . Wrote Fisher : " Why is there a realm ' which is not the law 's business ? ' Just because man 's ultimate responsibility is to God alone , and in that responsibility no man can deliver his own brother , there is a sacred realm of privacy ... a realm of his own essential rights and liberties ( including , in the Providence of God , liberty ' to go to the devil ' ) . " Into this liberty , wrote Dr. Fisher , the law must not intrude : " Only God 's love has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in principle , with the Wolfenden Report 's strictly limited premise that the law must confine itself to preserving public order and decency , Fisher nevertheless cautiously conceded that if " without undue interference " the law can do anything " to strengthen the moral stamina of the people , it ought to do it ... It is not easy to say whether the community as a whole does not need protection from the private immoralities , whether of homosexuals or of heterosexuals . " But , in sum , he doubted that a clear way could be found " by which , without fatal damage to the general principle of the report , adultery , fornication and homosexual offences could be effectively restrained by legal penalties .
