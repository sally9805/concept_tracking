When he took over his new parish three years ago , energetic Don Giuseppe Bon-insegna was well aware that he was a " missionary in the land of the faithless . " The little village of Gaggio di Piano is the Reddest village in Bologna province , and Bologna province is the Reddest province in Italy . Only about 200 of Don Giuseppe 's 3,000 parishioners were faithful Roman Catholics ; the rest were more or less faithful Communists . <P> After the election last June , the 35-year-old priest felt more like a benighted missionary than ever . Though there was virtually no unemployment and the wine industry was flourishing , Gaggio di Piano gave the Christian Democrats only 161 votes against 1,020 for the Communist Party . Don Giuseppe decided that what he needed was a working-class appeal . He began buttonholing members of his infidel flock and telling them : " The essence of Christianity is work-material as well as spiritual . Why , Christ himself was a worker for 30 of his 33 years . " Somewhat to his surprise , a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parish would build a recreation center and dedicate it to Christ the Worker . The Communists sneered at the project and started a campaign against it . but a few of their supporters chipped in on the sly . <P> Last week , at the still unfinished " House of the Worker " on the village 's main square , Don Giuseppe prepared to dedicate the first monument in Italy to depict Christ as a worker : a 4-by-8-ft. cement bas relief by Roman Sculptor Egidio Giaroli showing Christ as a carpenter at work with two assistants under the gaze of Mary . Bologna 's famed archbishop , Giacomo Cardinal Lercaro ( TIME , March 30 ) , came to town for the ceremony . <P> When the day dawned , however , it was the Communists of Gaggio di Piano who rubbed their hands . Rain-heavy clouds scudded down from the Apennines and broke into a pelting downpour . No speech was possible at the ceremony ; after a hasty unveiling , the cardinal gathered his sopping robes around him and made a dash for the rectory . But Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the church for Mass , then out again into the drenched square , came almost 800 men . women and children-the biggest congregation the priest had ever seen in Gaggio di Piano . <P> Drying out afterward in the rectory , the cardinal took the village priest aside . " My son . " he said , " you have hit the right road ! "
