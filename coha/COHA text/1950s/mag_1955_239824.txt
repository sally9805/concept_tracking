Eleven times in the last 50 days , one man at Yucca Flat , Nev. has given the word to set off an atom blast , and at least 50 times he has postponed explosions . He is Dr. Alvin Cushman Graves , 46 , scientific adviser to the test manager . Dr. Graves must be satisfied that all Atomic Energy Commission safety requirements have been met . For example , the AEC has ruled that nearby towns such as Las Vegas , Tonopah , Indian Springs , Caliente and Paradise Valley shall not receive more than 3.9 roentgens* from radioactive fallout within any twelvemonth , a figure far below a commonly accepted danger point of 25 . <P> Graves is a physicist who has lived in the strange world of atomic experiment most of his adult years . He has been at Los Alamos since 1943 . His wife is an atomic physicist , and of her work Graves says : " I 've been doing so much administrative work and so little research in the past few years that she has passed me so far I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the reason he especially understands the extra need for caution during nuclear tests is a personal one . He once stood a foot from atomic death . In 1946 he was working at Los Alamos with a young physicist , Louis Slotin . Something went wrong with Slotin 's experiment and he absorbed 800 roentgens in a split second , dying seven days later . Graves , who was right behind him , absorbed 200 roentgens and survived . Today his left eye is cloudy from a radiation cataract . <P> Half-Globe Weather Report . At Yucca Flat Graves sorts out hundreds of requests and reports from military , research and civil-defense agencies . Twenty-four hours before a test is scheduled , he meets with 100 members of the staff in a windowless , rectangular room . Dress ranges from khaki to cowboy shirt , but there is strict attention when the meteorologist starts to talk . <P> A weather report on half the globe is read , then the weatherman narrows down to the continental U.S. , finally gives a mile-by-mile analysis of the weather expected over Yucca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind up to 50,000 feet , and temperature is illustrated on charts and defended under a scientific inquisition . Its object : to assess the danger from radioactive fallout . After the weather discussion , Graves questions scientists in charge of each phase of the prospective test . " Are your experiments in order ? " " Are you satisfied your setups are O.K. ? " Each nods his answer , and Graves makes his first decision : the test is scheduled for the next day . <P> Then Graves roams the 640-sq. - mi. test area in his oyster-white , radio-equipped Chevrolet or his helicopter , asking questions , weighing the answers . While 30 to 35 meteorologists check and recheck the wind to see if there is any hint of a change , half a hundred safety officers in cars and helicopters search the wasteland to shepherd flocks of sheep or lonely prospectors out of the danger area .
