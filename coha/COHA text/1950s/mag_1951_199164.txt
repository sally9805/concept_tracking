Two young students from Britain , members of the Oxford University debating team , stood one evening last week , outside the Norfolk State Prison Colony , 15 miles southwest of Boston , and gazed up at the big concrete walls . " I have one ancestor who was a murderer , " said Richard Taverne . Said William Rees-Mogg : " My only criminal ancestor was a bigamist in the 18th Century . " After delivering themselves of these genealogical notes , the two Britons marched up to the gatehouse and went inside . After a 2-month undefeated tour of U.S. campuses , the Oxonians were making one of their last U.S. appearances-this time with the Norfolk prison debating team . <P> Norfolk was more than ready for them . Its two star debaters , Murdo the Robber and Bill the Bad Check Passer , had spent weeks getting ready for the occasion . They had studied in the library , written to Washington and the American Medical Association , pored over reams of statistics and dozens of reports . Like Oxford , Norfolk had an honorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " debating , it had taken on such teams as Harvard , Princeton and M.I.T. Its score : 34 victories , 4 draws , only 14 defeats . <P> Question of Distribution . Norfolk had never encountered anything quite like Oxford before , and by 6:30 p.m. the big auditorium was packed with 400 convicts , all staring fixedly at their two guests . After a few remarks by the chaplain ( " I wish this could be a home &; home debate " ) , Charlie the Program Chairman ( armed robbery ) introduced the speakers , and Francis the Timekeeper ( housebreaking ) started his stop watch . The question of the evening : " Resolved that this house recognize the need for a free national health service . " First speaker for the affirmative : Oxford 's Richard Taverne . <P> Taverne conceded that the U.S. had an excellent health record . But " the question , " said he , " is whether the medical services are adequately distributed . " He pointed out that in U.S. states with poor medical service , the death rate is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the A.M.A. , was also armed with statistics , all proving what a dismal failure a socialized health plan would be , compared to laissez-faire U.S. medicine . Oxford 's Rees-Mogg was ready with an answer . " The best preventive medicine , " said he , " is early diagnosis . The best way to encourage people to do this is to make medical services free . People will go to the doctors when they do not have to pay . " <P> Political Camouflage . Finally , Bill the Check Passer rose to speak , and his argument was just the sort of thing his audience understood . " Guests of Norfolk , voluntary and involuntary , " he began , " a free national health service will not make medical services better , but worse . The neurotics and malingerers will swamp our doctors and make it impossible for them to tend the really sick . I have been an unwilling native in a socialist Utopia for some time , and I know it will not work . . . This talk of free service is just political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
