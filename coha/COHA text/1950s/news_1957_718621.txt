txt Letters to The Times To THE EDITOR OF TH ENEW YORK TaiEs : The account on March 10 regarding Ambassador Charles E. Bohlen 's prospective transfer from Moscow to Manila reminds us once again of the unfair and undemocratic manner in which top diplomatic posts are assigned and of the adverse effect which thil , has on the interests of the United States . The question is not whether Manila is an important post or whether Mr. Bohlen will do a good job there , ? of course it is and of course he will . The question is whether that is the place where the Government can make the best use of his special qualifications , based on a lifetime of study of Soviet policy , fluency in the Russian language and four tours of service in Moscow over a period of twenty-eight years . Would they not be more directly useful in a post like Vienna or Ankara or Stockholm , where Soviet maneuvers can be observed close at hand , or in one of the great capitals ? London , Paris , Rome or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss with our principal allies the great problems connected with Soviet policy ? . Impression Created It Is especially disagreeable to read the reasons which your Washington correspondent indicates are responsible for this particular transfer . They reinforce the impression , already created in previous dispatches regarding recent appointments to other posts , that the top diplomatic positions in our Government are considered of such slight importance that anyone who is sufficiently rich is supposed to be able to fill them and can as a matter of course push aside Foreign Service officers who have proved their competence through long and devoted service in more arduous and less agreeable capitals . Not all non-career appointments are made on the basis of wealth or contributions to party funds ; and not all the non-career appointments to capitals where private wealth is essential are made on the basis of wealth alone ; often the latter take account of other substantial qualifications also . The fact remains that under present conditions no man who is not very rich is able to afford the costs of entertainment which have become traditional in the great capitals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career men to the top posts of their profession . This system is not fair by anything that one would like to think of as the American way of doing things . It is unfair to the United States in a period when it faces increasing responsibilities and dangers in many parts of the world . It is unfair to the great countries with which we maintain relations . It is unfair to the individuals who are penalized by it . Unfair Handicap It is even unfair to those who seem to profit from it , as the successful appointees discover when they reach their coveted posts and find the handicaps under which they must operate . The considerations which led to their appointment will have been frankly revealed in the press at home and , of course , reprinted in the capitals where they now arrive to represent the United States . In the popular imagination they always appear with money bags shackled to their legs . It is often an unfair handicap , but it will remain so long as it is known that the American system does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prepared to pay the bills out of his own pocket . We make great efforts to find promising young men to enter the Foreign Service and we are improving the opportunities and requirements for them to progress in competence as they rise in it . Then just when they become especially valuable we fail to treat them well enough to keep them in the Government . According to your news account , Ambassador Bohlen , who is only 52 , plans to retire soon and is being sent to Manila at least partly in order to protect his rights to retirement pay at levels earned by his service in Moscow . Political Rewards If that is even one of the reasons for sending Mr. Bohlen to Manila , it is or should be as unsatisfactory to the American public as the fact that the conditions of the service are such that a man of his caliber intends to retire before age requires . Mention is made that he was not sent to Vienna because that post is " earmarked " for a non-career man . In all respects the affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiefs of the Foreign Service are forced to operate it in view of the fact that top posts are almost always reserved as rewards for political services . If a President just elected by an overwhelming majority can not rise above what i -- . after all only an elegant manifestation of the spoils system , there is little hope that an improvement will ever be made without new legislation . Congress is , in fact , the place where the primary responsibility for present conditions resides , and it should act to correct them . The remedial action of Congress should be both positive and negative . It should provide sufficient funds for legitimate representation expenses at all diplomatic posts both for heads of mission and fol their principal assistants ; this i4 done by all other great countries , many of them in straitened financial situations compared to tilt United States . Secondly , it should prohibit by law the appointment to a diplomatic post of any person who has made a contribution of more than , say , $1,000 in the preceding Presidential campaign , either directly or through relatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , March 12 , 1957 . **25;325;TOOLONG India Declared to Be Occupying Area by Force To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK . TIMES The reasoning in K. B. Tandan 'S letter in your issue of March 4 has already been repeated ad nauseant by V. K. Krishna Menon before the Security Council in successive state . ments lasting over twenty hours : Mr. Tandan has objected to Ar ? thur Krock 's reference to the forcible annexation of Kashmir . According to Mr. Tandan Kashmir had already " acceded " to India  --  the basil of that " accession " of course being the accession by the Maharajah . That accession has already been impeached as spurious and contrary to the wishes of Kashmir 's people . But now we have evidence from a very authoritative source  --  namely , V. P. Menon , who was at one time Constitutional Adviser to the Governor General of India , and in 1941 became Secretary to the newly created Ministry for States , and who also served as an emissary between the Government of India and the Maharajah of Kashmir . Discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Integration of the Indian States , " he reports about a meeting of the Defense Committee , discussing Kashmir 's accession , thus : " He ( Lord Mountbatten ) further expressed the strong opinion that , in view of the composition of the population , accession should be conditional on the will of the people being ascertained by a plebiscite after the raiders had been driven out of the state and law and order had been restored . This was readily agreed to by Nehru and other Ministers . " Mr. Tandan proceeds , as did Mr. Krishna Menon , on the thesis that accession was a divinely ordained act which it is not open to mere mortals to question . But if they are asked whether this sanctity attaches only to the ruler of Kashmir or whether it attached to the ruler of Junagadh also , the answer is never forthcoming . Why ? Because , the very accession by which they swear in the case of Kashmir , they tore to pieces and trampled under foot in the case of Junagadh . Similarly , they never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruler of Hyderabad . Mr. Tandan takes another leaf from Mr. Krishna Menon 's book by citing " outrages " committed by tribal raiders . He would have the world believe that the Indian Army was hailed as saviors by the population of Kashmir . That contention is a mocking commentary on the persistent refusal of the Government of India to let the people of Kashmir show their indignation at those outrages through a free and impartial plebiscite . U. N. Mediator 's Report Mr. Tandan has again quote from Sir Owen Dixon 's report . You readers have only to see a few sen tences before and after the sen tences quoted , and they will under stand what the actual force of tha quotation is . Sir Owen Dixon gay ( this obiter dictum in order to em phasize the fact that the point we. : wholly irrelevant to the assignment which had been entrusted to him . The Indian game in any discus. sion of the Kashmir question is to confuse the basic issue of the Kash. miri people 's right of self-determination . This is done by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan 's so-called " original aggression . " Recent meetings of the Security Council on the Kashmir dispute served as an occasion for editorial and other comment in newspapers throughout the world , and the world press has almost in one voice condemned Mr. Nehru for his occupation of Kashmir by force .
