txt America is facing up to Communist world aggression on a-scale of united effort and individual sacrifice never before needed , not even in wartime . What President Truman 's 1952 budget request to Congress ? of over $71,000,000,000 means is that the American people will have to dig nearly twice as deep as ever before to meet the anticipated expenses of the government . How can the country avoid an unbearable internal stress on the national economy while spending at this prodigious rate to achieve security against external aggression ? Mr. Truman 's un4ualified answer is " pay as we go . " For this reason Congress is being asked to find over $16,000 , - 000,000 in new taxes  --  over and above the barrel-scraping tax program voted last year . ' Details of the new tax proposals will be submitted to Congress later this month . But the President 's budget message snows plainly that the burden of this national effort to " meet the barbaric threat of communism " must fall for the most part on the factory worker , the schoolteacher , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Irest of the lower-income group . Nation to Take It President Truman 's top economic advisers have assured him that this vast integrated nation of farm and factories , with its vast latent wealth of mines and forests and falling waters , can sustain itself at this level of national spending . Even though , too , some 70 per cent of this colossal outlay is for the unproductive cost of war and its collateral expenses in the field of international security and foreign relations , the nation can weather it , Mr. Truman insists . For one thing , income taxes will have to be increased greatly to carry out the President 's request to balance this mammoth budget . It is widely assumed here that Congress will have to enact a national sales tax . The boost in income taxes should be made retro , active to Jan. 1 . Low Incomes Hit Every sign points to the need for the people earning $10,000 a year or less shouldering the bulk of the new tax load . This is only the surface price of America 's determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system under the mastery of men " who are " guided by twisted dogma . " The 1952 federal budget means , of course , that the administration will have to forego many broad social welfare undertakings here at home , plans that were dear to every liberal in the land . But if " we must defer , in many cases , new governmental programs to enrich our national life and contribute to our individual and family welfare , " Mr. Truman points out a greater consolation to the people . For in return , he reminds us , " we will get something precious  --  strength to meet and to overcome the barbaric threat of communism in whatever manner it confronts us . " Only the Beginning At the same time , Mr. Truman warns that the financial sacrifices demanded by the new federal budget may be only the beginning of a long , hard row . He says the 1953 and 1954 budgets may be even bigger . And anybody who thinks that the experts can scrape any more fat from nondefense spending just does n't know budgets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to balance the budget , even if it means finding $20,000,000,000 in new revenues instead of just $16,000,000,000 . To ease the strain on those whom this year 's huge new tax load will fall heaviest , the White House will demand extension and improvement of laws controlling rents and other vital living essentials . Early attention is expected to recontrol rents in defense areas . Almost certainly now , across- the-board wage-price controls will be announced soon . It goes without saying that friends and allies overseas are scanning this budget message with a heartening awareness of what these weighty tables mean in terms of America 's resurgent national purpose . Especially the very vital statistic showing that nearly 70 cents out of every tax dollar will go to military services and foreign aid . ? What the Administration does with respect to price and wage . controls-will be important in preventing inflation . Obviously , Mr. Truman 's pay-asyoui-go plan is a powerful brake of itself . But holding down prices on raw materials and manufactured goods is highly essential to keep the economic flywheel in place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what the proposals spelled out in Mr. Truman 's budget message aim to do ? then the nation and its allies will get more tanks , planes , ships , and other war material for their $41,400,000,000 of direct military expenditures . Boost Almost Double By the time the current arms program works up full momentum the government will be spending at the rate of $60,000,000,000 a year dr more . The 1952 arms budget is almost a 100 per cent boost over the current military program . Before the outbreak of war in Korea the United States was spending $12 , - 000,000,000 , only the word " staggering " was often used in connection with " spending . " Pentagon planners expect the arms budget will level off around $60,000,000,000 , and remain there for about four years . The " good old days " of modest government spending may never return . Here at home the man in the street naturally is more than ' a little awed by this 78 per cent increase in federal expenditures . His first reaction is " can we afford it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nalion 's top financial advisers have no qualms on this score .. Defense budget to cost every American $471 : Page 3.
