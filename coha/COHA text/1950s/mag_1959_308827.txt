Congregational Christian Church leaders are determined to give integration more than moral support . They are offering cash . Any Congregational church that hesitates to integrate its members for fear of financial losses can appeal to the Board of Home Missions for a grant , the board announced this week . At the same time , the mission board made two contributions of $2,500 each to the National Council of Churches ' department of racial and cultural relations and to the legal-defense fund of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People . <P> The Board also published a study of " racial inclusiveness , " a term defined as the presence of at least one member in a congregation " other than the dominant racial group .

Said a board statement : " Scant basis for complacency . . . We have much yet to undertake in order to live up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racial segregation is a sin . "
