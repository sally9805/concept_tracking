Generals may run the army , but the authority felt by the harried recruit is the rasping voice of the sergeant . Like many another veteran who has heard that voice too often , Dr. Burgess L. Gordon , Philadelphia chest specialist and onetime army colonel , is convinced that sergeants are really bad medicine . <P> The command , " Suck in your gut ! " Dr. Gordon told the International Congress of Chest Diseases in Rio de Janeiro , may make a chubby draftee look more soldierly , but it may also damage his health . Rigid military posture prevents a man from using his lungs properly . And faulty breathing can cause discomfort over the heart , upset digestion , bring on insomnia and depression . A moderate paunch . Dr. Gordon said , might better be left to its own devices . Military or not , " the important asset of the firm , rounded abdomen is its capacity to support the diaphragm within the effective range of expiration and inspiration . " <P> In a brief bow to military tradition , the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of soldierly equipment . And the fellow with a " relaxed , obese , pendulous formation " should do something about it . Let the drill sergeants work on him .
