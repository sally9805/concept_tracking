Last week some 150 American colleges and universities concluded their 1958 Intercollegiate Bridge Championship  --  one of the annual competitions in the three Bs ( bowling and billiards are the others ) sponsored by the Association of College Unions . The problem  --  how to let each college compete with all the others scattered throughout the United States without leaving its own campus  --  is solved by the device of having them play " par " hands . // Unlike the usual bridge tournament , where the deck is shuffled and dealt at random the first time each hand is played , the intercollegiate decks are stacked . Thus , all over the country , the collegians are able to play the same 16 hands , which have been prearranged by Tournament Director Geoffrey Mott-Smith to include some predetermined point of bidding or play . Some weeks hence , after judging the score cards sent to him by mail , he will decide the various title winners . // While the collegians are waiting to know who won the laurels ( captured last year by Cornell 's Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klein-man and Dick Recht at East-West ) , let 's look over one of the more spectacular deals which the undergrads and coeds had to tackle this year : // Dealer South East-West vulnerable // NORTH // King of Spades 10 of Spades 8 of Spades 5 of Spades 6 of Hearts Ace of Clubs Jack of Clubs 10 of Clubs 7 of Clubs 4 of Clubs 10 of Diamonds 9 of Diamonds 2 of Diamonds // WEST // 3 of Spades 2 of Spades Jack of Hearts 10 of Hearts 9 of Hearts 5 of Hearts 2 of Hearts 9 of Clubs 8 of Clubs 6 of Clubs Ace of Diamonds Jack of Diamonds 7 of Diamonds // SOUTH // Ace of Spades Queen of Spades Jack of Spades 9 of Spades 7 of Spades Queen of Hearts 7 of Hearts 3 of Hearts Queen of Clubs 3 of Clubs King of Diamonds Queen of Diamonds 6 of Diamonds // EAST // 6 of Spades 4 of Spades Ace of Hearts King of Hearts 8 of Hearts 4 of Hearts King of Clubs 5 of Clubs 2 of Clubs 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diamonds // The North-South hands offer clear-cut values for a bid of four spades , and might properly get there on this bidding : // SOUTH // 1 Spade 2 Spade 3 NO TRUMP PASS // WEST // PASS PASS PASS PASS // NORTH // 2 Club 3 Spade 4 Spade // EAST // PASS PASS PASS // West 's normal opening lead is the jack of hearts , and when East wins the trick the defenders ' problem becomes one of , " Button , button , who 's got ta have the buttons ? " // Dummy 's visible singleton having put the chill on East 's hopes of a second heart trick , it is apparent to East that , in addition to his own king of clubs , the defenders will have to find two other tricks . There can be little doubt that the prospecting for these tricks must be done in the diamond department , so East shifts to a diamond . // In order to tell partner that he can not count on a high card in East 's hand to contribute toward building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diamond 8 , proclaiming this card as the top of nothing ! Then , though South may play a deceitful king , West should read the situation correctly and do his part in the game of button-button by letting South hold the trick . // This is the crucial play . If West takes the first diamond trick , he can not continue the suit without nullifying the power of his jack . Any other return gives declarer time to establish the clubs . But West must see that the game ca n't be defeated unless his partner can win a trick , and if he keeps the ace-jack behind declarer 's queen , South has no answering coup . The club finesse must be lost to East 's king , and a second diamond lead earns a fine par result for those collegians who mount this brilliant defense . // Extra Tricks : " Par " type games have become very popular in Europe . Sometimes the problems are especially difficult ; usually they are also unusual . Those confronting the collegians are less trying .
