CAPTAIN JOSHUA SLOCUM ( 384 pp. ) - Victor Slocum-Sheridan House ( $5 ) . <P> <P> Nobody else wanted the old sloop ; for years she had been propped up and rotting away in a meadow not far from salt water . But lean , grizzle-bearded Captain Joshua Slocum desperately wanted the 36-footer , and he got her . By the time he had put in a year 's work rebuilding the Spray into a staunch , well-found craft , he was ready to put to sea . One spring day in 1895 , with only Slocum aboard , the Spray sailed out of Boston harbor on what turned out to be a 46,000-mile voyage . At 51 , Joshua Slocum was doing what he had wanted to do since 16 ; he was sailing alone around the world in a small boat . <P> Thirty-eight months later , Slocum sailed the Spray into the harbor at Newport , R.I. , the first man to circumnavigate the earth alone .

In trying to explain how he managed his round-the-world voyage , modest Captain Slocum wrote that " above all to be taken into account were some years of schooling , where I studied with diligence Neptune 's laws .
