 | Marsh Dwellers of Southern Iraq ARABS say the Garden of Eden stood at the present site of Al Qurna , a small town at the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers . Tourists who come there from near-by Basra are shown a thorn tree , surrounded by a palisade , which they are told is the tree of knowledge of good and vil . Recently the old tree fell down , but the townsmen , reluctant to lose such a profitable attraction , have planted another . No Eden Now ; More Water Than Land All around Al Qurna lies a strange region few visitors ever penetrate ? the marshes of southern Iraq , into which the Tigris and Euphrates overflow during spring floods ( page 224 ) . Anyone who has flown from Europe to the Persian Gulf , to India , or to the Far East has passed over this widespread marshland ( map , page 211 ) . Just before the plane gets to Basra , passengers see below them a vast patchwork of reed beds , lagoons , and waterways . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane is low enough , they may see water buffaloes and canoes . It all looks grim and desolate from the air , and that is about as close as most foreigners have been to it . The main road from Basra to Baghdad runs northward through Al Qurna , up the west bank of the Tigris , along a narrow strip of dry land . The marshes stretch away on either side of the road ? a waste of mud , water , and monotonous vegetation . Few people looking at it would think it a tempting or rewarding country . In winter it is cold and often damp ; in summer it is terribly hot and sticky and there are clouds of mosquitoes , midges , and other insects . Yet people live here , following . i way of life that I , dwelling among them , found full of fascination and even charm . The houses the marsh people build of reeds are marvels of ingenuity and beauty . During the winter the marshes are alive with wild fowl a wonderland of birds . I have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded me of swarms of locusts . I have watched , spellbound , while seemingly endless skeins of geese passed overhead and the cold air rang with their calling . There are many sorts of birds ? herons , coots , cormorants , pelicans , ibises , avocets , flamingos , eagles , ospreys , and falcons . Sometimes you see a family of otters playing in a lagoon , and there are wild boars , among the largest in the world . I have counted 30 or 40 boars feeding in the open outside a reed bed . Truculent and immensely powerful , they are the marshman 's bitter enemy . They destroy his crops and all too often attack and sometimes kill him while he is cutting reeds . Spring Brings Color to Marshes There is a tranquil beauty in the marshes , especially in springtime , when the shallow water is white with flowering ranunculuses or ablaze with vivid yellow or snow-white nymphoides . Then the marshlands look like a green meadow carpeted with daisies and buttercups ( page 232 ) . There are also the deeper lagoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is blue under a blue sky , and floating islands ? tangled jungles of giant reeds , sedges , and brambles ? drift languidly . And there are narrow , tortuous waterways , shut in by almost impenetrable reed beds 20 feet and more in height , where the tasseled reedtops form an ever-changing pattern against the sky as you glide along in your canoe .  | The marsh is a place of many moods and colors , sometimes bright and sparkling , sometimes dark and somber . You can get lashing rain or tearing gales or a damp heat that wraps itself round you like a wet towel . But to me the real fascination of this land is the marshmen and their way of life . I have been with them now , on and off , for the past seven years . They were not easy to get to know . They are primitive and suspicious and have a bad name among the surrounding tribes . Bedouin Arabs despise them for their dubious lineage and willingly impute to them every sort of perfidy and wickedness . Townsmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shun them , and readily believe all they hear against them . Among the British , too , their reputation is bad . This feeling is a legacy from World War I , when , from the shelter of their marshes , they murdered and looted both sides indiscriminately as opportunity offered . Few People Know the Ma'dan During the years of British administration in Iraq , the political officers were too busy with more important problems to concern themselves very much with the marshmen , or Ma'dan . Since then few people have had the time or inclination to travel among them . To know them properly , you must stay with them in their villages and live as they do for long periods of time . No one had done this before I went there . In a small canoe paddled by a mainland Arab , I went into the marshes without kit or provisions to live with the Ma'dan , entirely dependent upon them for food , shelter , and transport . We paddled for two hours along narrow , twisting corridors among the reeds , passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men or boys , often naked , who eyed us curiously . At last we got to a village , a strange-looking place in the middle of a shallow lagoon sur- rounded by reed beds . There were a court of hundred houses , each on its own lit artificial island ; many buffaloes , some sta ing outside the houses and others submerge to their noses in the water ; and an endl coming and going of marshmen in their can We headed for the nearest house . elderly man , dressed in a long cotton s with a thin , curved dagger at his waist and black-and-white checked cloth thrown o% his head , hailed us and bade us welcome . is this easy , informal hospitality that is pleasant among tribal Arabs . You turn up  | He pushed our way past some buffaloes and entered . Our host threw down a piece of carpet for us to sit on and busied himself brewing us some tea ; and I mean " brewing , " for he boiled it more than half an hour . The house was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform built from bundles of thick reeds on which were piled some tattered quilts , cushions , and pieces of clothing . At the far end of the house were two women , unveiled ? no marshwoman wears a veil ? three naked children , two buffalo calves , a dog , a cat , and some chickens . There were some cooking pots , grindstones , a large mortar and pestle , an earthenware pitcher , a sack of rice , and nothing else except a bundle of fishing spears , paddles , and punting poles . We drank tea , black and sweet , out of small glasses , and then my Arab canoeman got up to go . Saying that he had work to do at home , he declined my host 's pressing invitation to stay for a meal , stepped into his canoe , and was gone . 209  | The food , when it came , was a large bowl of rice with sour milk poured over it , the marshmen 's staple diet . Sometimes they eat fish or wild fowl , and often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . We ate with our fingers , which is the custom among tribal Arabs ? my host , his two sons , who had just got back from cutting reeds , and myself . The women and children finished what was left . I spent the night with them , wrapped in one of their quilts . Luckily fleas do n't worry me , but they kept me awake at first by weight of numbers . After breakfast ? three glasses of tea and a piece of bread ? my hosts took me on and delivered me at the next villa . where I started all over again , a stranger in a very strange land . Naturally the people were suspicious of me and wondered what on earth I was up to . Most of the Europeans they had seen come out from Basra to shoot on the edge of the marshes and had gone back in the even ' to their own homes or to a sheik 's guesthouse on the mainland . They could not understand why I should forsake the comfort of the towns  | to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless for some ulterior motive . I had hoped at first to persuade some of them to travel with me around the marshes . They refused . Men from each village took me as far as the next and left me there . However , they got used to me in time . They found that I not only did them no harm but actually some good . I shot the wild boar that plagued them . I doctored their sick . Slowly we became friends . Now I can count on as many paddlers as I need to take me where I wish to go and to @#  | remain with me as long as I require them . They are a genial , happy people , welcoming and friendly once they have accepted you . English people often call the marshmen " Marsh Arabs , " but I do not like the name ; I am convinced that most of them are not pure Arabs but belong to earlier stock . Among the Madan there is probably Sumerian , Babylonian , and Persian blood . The Madan are buffalo-owning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same family , living on the edge of the marshes , one man may call himself a fellah , or cultivator of the soil , another Ma'di , or marshman . The difference is not one of race but of habitat , and to some extent of occupation . Madan and fellahs both keep buffaloes , grow rice , move about in canoes , and spear fish . Among the Ma'dan the emphasis is on buffaloes . These animals are the most important things in their lives , as vital to them as camels are to people of the desert ; among the fellahs it is cultivation of the soil that matters most . It is interesting , and I think significant . that while a Bedouin would , always boast that he was a Bedouin and malay Arabs proudly claim Bedouin origin , the word Ma'di outside the marshes is synonymous with " yokel ... Even the marshmen boast of being Madan only when they claim for themselves the technical skill proper to a marshman . I have frequently heard a Ma'di say to another marshman who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ma'di or an Arab ? " Most of the villages are semiaquatic , but sometimes the houses are clustered together on small islands , many of them the sites of ancient villages and towns .  | The marshmen think there is buried treasure on most of these islands . Occasionally they unearth small statues or pots filled with ancient coins . I was given a small piece of lead sheeting that bore writing since identified as Phoenician . All the marsh people believe in a mysterious island called Hufaidh , which they say is guarded by spirits who have the power to make it invisible or to cause anyone to go mad who visits it . On this island are reputed to be buried treasures , palm groves , and gardens filled with pomegranate and other fruit trees . Flood Waters Invade Houses In most villages the houses are built on stacks of rushes packed behind a low reed fence to form a sodden platform . This platform constantly subsides , and its level is continually being raised with new layers of rushes . During floods the water sometimes rises inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the raised reed platform built in the middle of each house to divide the family quarters from the men 's side , where guests are entertained . Among the Madan there is , however , little  | if any attempt to keep the women apart from the visitors . The family side of the house is used for cooking , and for this reason visitors are invited to sit at the other end . Anyone can enter from either end and sit and talk with the women , if he wishes . The more permanent houses are built of overlapping split-reed mats laid over five or even more parallel ribs made from bundles of reeds . Each rib is constructed by setting two long , tightly bound bundles of reeds into the ground opposite each other , the width of the house apart and inclined outward . The tops of the bundles are then pulled inward and spliced one into the other to form a horseshoe arch ( page 208 ) . Guesthouses Always Face Mecca Transverse bundles of reeds , some six inches in diameter , are fastened close together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are then sewed onto this framework , with sufficient overlay to ensure a treble or quadruple thickness of matting . Four thick but tapering pillars of reeds support the two end walls , which consist of alternating matting and trelliswork . In warm weather the house ends are left open , but in cold , wet , or windy weather they are closed with mats . From this simple type of house have evolved the spacious barrelvaulted mudhifs , or guesthouses , that are such a conspicuous feature of larger villages around the marshes , especially on the lower Euphrates ( pages 210 and 219 ) . All mudhifs and houses are built with an odd number of arches , either 5 , 7 , 9 , 11 , 13 , and occasionally 15 or more . The number of arches in a mudhif is fixed for each tribe and family . Its entrance always faces Mecca . Buildings Made Entirely of Reeds A typical mudhif , in which I have often stayed , consists of 11 arches and is 60 feet long , 20 feet wide , and 18 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 21 arches and was 120 feet long . The rib of each arch is nine feet in circumference at the bottom , tapers to about two and a half feet at the top , and is made from a great number of thin reeds carefully bound together . The inside of the mudhif conveys the impression of great space , so that one has the curious feeling of being inside a cathedral , an effect enhanced by the ribbed vaulting and the trellis-covered windows ( page 206 ) . This impression is not altogether lost outside the building , where the heavy tapering columns supporting the facade break the skyline at the arched roof . These beautiful reed buildings have never ceased to amaze me . Canoes are indispensable to the Madan . Without them the marshmen would be immobile , unable in many cases to move from one end of a village to the other and quite unable to gather reeds as fodder for their buffaloes or to spear fish . They call their craft by the general term mashuf . There is a silver model of a canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely resembles a present-day mashuf . These boats are built of planks meeting flush at the seams , flat-bottomed , and coated outside with bitumen . The top half of the ribs is planked on the inside ; the outer planking is carried forward and upward to form a long , thin , tapering stem , which parts the reeds as the canoe is forced through the marshes . There is a thwart about a third of the way forward , and a strengthening beam across the boat two-thirds of the way forward . Passengers always sit on the bottom of the craft , never on the thwart ( page 218 ) . Canoemen Cover Great Distances Taradas , which were once the war canoes of the marshes and are still used by the sheiks because of their speed and comfort , are as long as 36 feet , but only about 3% feet across at their greatest beam . They will carry 12 people . Unlike the ordinary mashuf , the taradas have floor boards , and the inside planking is decorated with rows of iron studs two inches across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor a broad . roomy canoe that can carry , a large load of reeds . A tarada or a large mashuf usually has a crew of five , two in the . bow and three in the stern , who pole or paddle in unison . first on one side and then on the other . The Madan pole their canoes whenever possible . since they then travel more quickly and with less effort . They cover 50 or 60 miles in a day with ease . Although these canoes have little freeboard. the Madan move about in them freely , often jumping from them into deep water and scrambling back without swamping them . They learn to handle a canoe almost before they can walk . They are , however , afraid of venturing out upon open water in bad weather .  | Once I was crossing a sheet of unprotected water about eight miles across . It was a calm , still morning when we started , but when we were halfway across we heard the wind . Had there not been a large sailing boat near by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the water here was six to eight feet deep . Many marshmen are drowned in these sudden storms . Nomads and Herds Move in Summer Some marshmen are seminomads . They spend the winter in the marshes grazing large herds of buffaloes on ground exposed by the receding water . They build themselves large temporary villages , the houses clustered close together , each house with a long annex at the entrance in which the animals shelter at night . In the summer the nomads move outside the marshes and graze their buffaloes along the riverbanks to the north . A nomad family may own 60 or more buffaloes ; a few families own as many as 200 . The majority of the Ma'dan are , however , settled in villages ( page 228 ) . Some cultivate rice , others spear fish , and yet others earn a living making reed mats and selling them to merchants , who come into the marshes to collect them . Unlike the nomads , villagers own few buffaloes . A man with a dozen would be reckoned well off , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buffaloes provide milk , cream , butter , and , in some villages , cheese . The dung is used for fuel . A buffalo is never slaughtered for food unless it is already sick and its owner is afraid it will die . Buffaloes Signal Day 's Beginning Some of the Ma'dan own a few small cows . Nearly every house is guarded by a watchdog , which is usually large and savage . There are a few cats in the villages , and some chickens . The buffaloes spend the night outside the houses , and at dawn they drop into the water with resounding splashes and swim off to their grazing grounds . Then the village comes to life . After a hurried breakfast everyone , man , woman , and child , gets into a canoe and heads off into the reeds . Some go to collect dried reeds for fuel or for matmaking , others to spear fish with long five-pronged spears like giant toasting forks . The tribesmen never net fish ; this is done only by a low-caste people known as Barbara ( page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the marshes where fresh , green shoots grow in recently burned reed beds . They fill their canoes with these shoots , which serve as fodder for the buffaloes at night . A great part of their lives is spent in collecting this fodder . It is hard work , especially in the terrible sticky heat of summer , but almost worse in winter , wading about waist deep in the icy water . Yet around the reed beds there is always merriment and laughter , with voices lifted in song . In the evenings , as the sun goes down , often blood red through the distant smoke of burning reeds , the buffaloes drift back from their grazing grounds . They scramble ponderously onto the platforms in front of the houses , water dripping from their flanks . Everyone is busy , carrying armloads of young reeds to scatter in front of the slowly ruminating buffaloes , lighting smoke fires to keep the mosquitoes off them during the night , or milking the buffalo cows into wooden pails . Frogs Provide Background Music It is very peaceful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reflected redly in the still , dark water ; ducks fly over high and fast , heading for their feeding grounds near by . A boy sings , his voice clear and sweet , as he paddles back toward the village . The endless chorus of the frogs grows with the passing minutes into a vibrant background of sound . Later , when it is dark , the villagers come paddling over in their canoes and crowd into the house where I am staying . They sit drinking tea and chatting , making room for each newcomer as he arrives . I have usually spent a busy day treating their ailments and hope that now I shall be able to rest . But often news of my presence has been carried to neighboring villages . A canoe arrives outside the house and another sick person is helped into the room . The Madan suffer much from sickness as @#  | a result of the conditions under which they live . The Iraqi Government maintains hospitals in Basra , Amara , An Nasiriya , and other large towns , and dispensaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often difficult for a marshman to spare the time from tending his buffaloes or his rice to go to one of these places for treatment . Most of them have had little contact with the world outside the marshes and prefer , when they fall sick , to remain in their villages and to hope for the best . I always carried with me a well-stocked medicine chest . Although I have no medical training , I have acquired , during 25 years of wandering in remote places , some practical knowledge of medicine and first aid . Living among the marshmen , I have sometimes been able to help them , but all too often I have been defeated by my ignorance . Bilharziasis and dysentery are the main scourges of the marshes . Bilharziasis , caused by parasitic worms invading the blood stream , is endemic in the area , and nearly everyone suffers from it . Dysentery is rife in both amoebic and bacillary forms . The water around the houses is always contaminated , and this is equally the case when the Madan are crowded together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom wade out more than a few feet to fill their pots . Living among the Madan , I could take no precautions , but luckily I escaped infection . Mosquitoes , but Little Malaria There are many other diseases from which they suffer , but there is surprisingly little malaria , despite the clouds of mosquitoes . The mosquitoes prevalent here are fortunately poor carriers of disease . Often someone has been brought in to me who has been badly wounded by a wild boar on which he had stumbled while gathering reeds . Some fail to survive the terrible injuries inflicted by the razor-sharp tusks. @# Wilfred Thr - .  | All marshmen enjoy singing and dancing . Frequently in the evening , after we have dined , someone starts to sing . A boy is sent off round the village to collect drums and tambourines . As these are warmed up at the fire to tighten the skins , and then tried out to test their tone , more men and boys come crowding into an already overcrowded room . " o one minds if the floor has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dance Spreads Quickly Soon the whole village knows that there is going to be a dance at this house . More men and boys arrive . The house is surrounded by empty canoes , and latecomers , who can not squeeze in , sit outside in their mashufs . Most of the marshmen join in the singing . They keep time to the music by beating the , round with the heel of one foot and clicking their two index fingers together , which makes a surprisingly loud noise . There are usually two or three people pounding drums , while several others are beating a rhythmic jingle on tambourines . The drums are made of clay , shaped like vases . about 18 inches long and 8 inches across at the wider ends , and covered with skin . They are played by tapping on them with the fingers . Boys are encouraged to get up and dance . either singly or two or three together . in the small space left in the center of the room . Their dancing varies a certain amount , since each boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is uniform . Most of the young men and boys . some of them quite small children , can dance , and the most virile of the lads is usually the most skillful . They enjoy dancing as they enjoy singing , but they would bitterly resent being called dancers , since this word is usually applied only to professional dancing boys . The dances performed by the village boys and the professional dancing boys are very much the same , but the villagers do it for fun and the dancing boys for pay . Snarling Marsh Dogs Fight Under the Eyes of Anxious Backers @#  | Most of the professional entertainers live in villages and towns outside the marshes . They travel about the country to perform at important weddings and other festivities . When dancing , they use castanets , which the villagers do not . New songs are frequently composed and sung by the Madan . A song that was wildly popular a couple of months ago . sung by everybody at marriage festivals or as they paddled their canoes , cut reeds , or sat in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be replaced by another . A marriage among the marsh people is always the occasion for great festivity . If the bride belongs to another village , friends of the bridegroom set out in the morning in their canoes to fetch her . The bridegroom himself never accompanies them but remains behind in his house . The greater part of the day is spent at the bride 's village in feasting and dancing . Toward evening everyone collects at the bride 's house , where they dance the hausa , or war dance . A man sings a couple of lines , which the others repeat in chorus as they stamp in a circle , brandishing weapons and firing rifles . Three Buffaloes for a Bride The young woman is then placed in a canoe with the carpets , cushions , quilts , chests , and a few provisions that her father has presented to her as her dowry . For his bride a man normally pays her father the equivalent of three buffaloes . The father spends as much or as little as he likes of this money on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new home . An important man might easily give his daughter clothes and household goods in excess of the value he had received as the bride 's price . The bride is accompanied to her new village not only by the party that has come to fetch her but also by friends from her own village . They stop in every village through which they pass to dance the hausa . The rejoicing reaches its climax as they approach the bridegroom 's home . On one occasion I attended the wedding of an orphaned boy called Dakhil . He had disposed of almost everything he possessed in order to pay the bride price . for he w. : - passionately in love with the girl and determined to marry her . He did not even own a house of his own . He erected a small red mosquito net at the end of a cousin 's house as his bridal chamber . Earlier Dakhil had spent the day lengthening the house with two more arches . Since he belonged to a different tribe from that of the rest of the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small affair . He was , however , an old friend of mine . He had for a while been one of my canoe boys . T therefore turned up at his marriage with party . We fired off a considerable number of rifle shots while we fetched the bride . This  | firing attracted marshmen from several surrounding villages , and the marriage became , for Dakhil 's village at any rate , the event of the year . In the evening the house was packed to suffocation , and many people had to sit outside in their canoes : inside , the singing and dancing were continuous . At midnight I left , thinking that Dakhil would be glad if the party broke up . When I saw the bridegroom in the morning , he was a bedraggled sight . His headrope was missing and his new shirt was sadly torn . Dakhil 's friends , who had remained behind in the house , laughingly maintained that his bride had thrown him out of the house into the water , a charge he indignantly denied . He never did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on , that I have lived among the marsh people , they have given me the freedom of the marshes and of their homes . Naturally they were suspicious at first , but even in those early days they were never inhospitable , never made me feel unwelcome when I entered a house . There are few corners of the marshland where I have not been and few villages in which I have not lived . I was alone among the people . except for brief periods when occasional Englishmen traveled with me , but I was never lonely . In the marshes I found friendship and peace .
