Almost every morning for the last 22 years , a self-effacing little man , careless-clad in baggy pants and a blue stocking cap , stepped down from the front porch of a modest frame house at 112 Mercer Street , Princeton , N.J. , and trudged off to the Institute for Advanced Studies . At a glance , the little man could have been the caretaker or a gardener . He puffed meekly at his pipe ; he sidled in quietly ; he seldom spoke unless spoken to . But on a second look , a rare quality seemed to glow in that sad and wizened face , with its disordered halo of white hair and its soulful brown eyes . The quality was genius , a compound of soaring intellect and wide-ranging imagination that had carried Albert Einstein past the confines of man 's old scientific certitudes and deeper into the material mysteries of the universe than any man before . <P> Last week Professor Einstein trudged no more in the grounds of his beloved institute . A lingering gall-bladder infection sent him to the hospital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artery . Shortly after midnight he muttered a few sentences in German . The night nurse could not understand , and the last words of the modern world 's greatest scientist were lost . At 1:15 a.m . Albert Einstein , 76 , died in his sleep . <P> Great Transformer . " No other man contributed so much to the vast expansion of 20th century knowledge , " said President Eisenhower . Pravda editorialized : " A great transformer of natural science . " Said the Prime Minister of Israel : " The world has lost its foremost genius . " <P> Thousands of other tributes poured in , but words could not convey the feelings of a world in which the many unquestioningly accepted Einstein 's genius while only the few-and they , of scientific training-adequately understood what he had contributed to knowledge . In person , Albert Einstein was diffident , almost childlike . As a man of scientific thought , he strode boldly with history 's handful : Pythagoras and Archimedes , Copernicus and Newton . <P> Einstein 's only instruments were a pencil and scratchpad ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther than a telescope , deeper than a microscope . Einstein traveled in lonely splendor to the crossroads of the visible and the invisible , expressing each in terms of the other . He came close to proving by mathematicians ' logic what men of religion had long accepted on philosophers ' reasoning or faith : that the laws which move the tiniest unseen electrons must also govern the macrocosms of intergalactic space . Einstein 's scratchpad theorems broke through the thought barriers of knowledge and rewrote the basic scientific law of the universe . The now-mundane miracle of television is a splinter off Einstein 's achievement ; the mushroom clouds of atomic fission and hydrogen fusion are his unwanted monuments ; mankind 's chance to turn earth-shaking force into good is his legacy .
