As President Adolfo Ruiz Cortines cracks down on one after another of the political millionaires who grew fat under the last administration , Mexicans are beginning to sound off publicly against the excesses of ex-President Miguel Alemn 's regime . Last week Justice Luis Corona and four other members of the supreme court were hearing arguments in the appeal of four men convicted in 1950 of the murder of a newsman . The defendants offered evidence that they had been framed by top officials working with the Alemn-created Federal Security Police , an outfit said to have been controlled by Miguel Alemn 's pal , ex-Senate President Carlos Serrano . As their story unfolded , Justice Corona interrupted to loose the most scathing blast yet against the Alemn regime by a highly placed Mexican . <P> " I cry out against this conspiracy ! " he said . " This Federal Security Police , this national insult , should exist no longer , now that there is no more booty to cover up . Now we have a First Magistrate who has the people 's support because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the filthy sewer of mud that has smothered the national conscience under a certain prosperity these past six years , and has transformed a pedregal old lava field into a spectacular oasis for the profit of investors . " <P> Leaving no doubt that he was talking about Alemn 's lavish new University City ( TIME , Feb. 23 ) , built at a cost of more than $25 million in the Mexico City suburb of Pedregal de San Angel , Justice Corona snapped : " All that material grandeur is a mausoleum in which is buried the dignity of Mexico . Would to God that in its place we had a well-kept park with a floral sign saying the nation is still ashamed . " <P> In the courtroom , spectators burst into loud applause . Court President Castro Estrada dutifully admonished Justice Corona ; the case went on . But newspapers played up the judge 's remarks , and popular comment seemed heavily in his favor .
