Into the White House last week popped small , wiry NPA and DPAdministrator Henry H. ( " Joe " ) Fowler . 44 . Ever since Defense Mobilizer Charles E. Wilson quit last March over Harry Truman 's steel policy , Fowler had been carrying many of Wilson 's worries but not his title . After an hour with the President , Fowler emerged wearing the title as well . It was passed on by Acting Mobilizer John R. Steelman , who , said Truman , was needed for his " fulltime role as assistant to the President . " <P> Since Fowler , a lawyer who has spent most of his time in Government bureaus since 1934 , is no production man , the obvious implication was that the arms program is now self-propelled . Steelman issued some sugar-coated figures that seemed to say so . Reported Steelman : " Total military hard-goods deliveries in June reached $2 billion-doubling that of nine months earlier . " <P> Steelman 's figures were not only stale , but misleading . As Fowler himself reported last week , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only $34 billion had been delivered by June 30 , two years later . A better cause for cautious optimism was that Mobilizer Fowler himself wants to speed up the stretched-out defense program . His first act as mobilization boss was to send word to the rearmament program 's severest critic , Texas ' Democratic Senator Lyndon Johnson , that he would do what he could to restore the original goals .
