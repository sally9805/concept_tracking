 | USUALLY an expedition to Africa aims at big-game hunting , missionary work , or exploration . In the spring of last r. however , one set out for Bloemfontein , th Africa , on the strange mission of exring another world . This other world was the planet Mars , which would spin closer to the earth that rnmer than it had done for 13 years ? a ere 39,800,000 miles away on July 2 , 1954 see diagrams , page 430 ) . * To Africa for a Grandstand Seat With the coordinating aid of the new Intertional Mars Committee , scientists in many untries seized the chance to renew their ttack on stubborn secrets of our red-andeen-faced neighbor . For example , they re eager to learn more about the amazing anges which sweep across its face continually , and particularly what causes vast areas to turn blue-green in Martian summer . To us of Lowell Observatory , this chance was particularly appealing , for Mars has been a favorite target of our telescopes since the days of our founder , Percival Lowell . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Italian discoverer are strips of vegetation along watercourses , and that the planet is being irrigated from the melting icecaps by intelligent beings struggling to keep alive on a dying planet . But to make full use of this golden chance to gain more information , we needed a grandstand seat in the Southern Hemisphere . Mars would lie so far south during the crucial months that the great telescopes of the Northern Hemisphere would be able to observe it for only a short period each night and at a low elevation above the horizon , where turbulence of the earth 's air interferes with what astronomers call " seeing . " Fortunately , the University of Michigan made available to us its excellent 27-inch refracting telescope , the largest in the Southern Hemisphere , at its observatory 's southern branch , Lamont-Hussey Observatory in Bloemfontein , South Africa . Here Mars would appear almost overhead each night , and we would have the longest and best possible type of seeing , through the shortest path of clear , dry South African air . Greatly impressed by these prospects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Geographic Society , whose generous assistance to worthwhile projects is widely known . The officials of The Society quickly recognized the need and the scientific importance of such an undertaking and agreed to sponsor , jointly with us , a six-month expedition to Bloemfontein for intensive study of the planet . In our conferences with The Society 's officers and Research Committee , it was agreed that the most valuable contribution to knowledge of Mars would be a complete and continuous set of photographs taken during the five best months of the opposition in at least three colors ? blue , yellow-green , and red . Blue Filter Reveals Martian Clouds Photographers well know that by the use of various colored filters they can reveal different aspects of a landscape or sky and penetrate haze . We applied the same techniques in probing the nature of Mars . Bluefilter photographs best reveal the planet 's clouds , for instance , while a red filter helps us detect changes in the blue-green regions . Carefully calibrated photographs , we hoped , would give us more accurate knowledge of the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles in diameter , or roughly half that of the earth . The program called for special types of plates , filters , cameras , and lenses ? all of which were either built or adapted at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff to fit the Lamont-Hussey telescope .

In three and a half days we reached Bloemfontein-14,000 miles in 38 flying hours . When you first land in a foreign country , it is heart-warming indeed to have someone bound forward with a warm welcome and offers of assistance . Such was our reception in South Africa , where we found the people cherishing a deep regard for the United States .

Dominating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands on Naval Hill at an altitude of 4,888 feet and about three miles from the center of the city . Its dome , like a bald head in a swimming pool , can be seen from miles out across the veld . This and the Boyden Station of Harvard College Observatory , 12 miles northeast at Mazelspoort , make the Bloemfontein region a noted center of astronomical observation . Despite our pleasant reception , we me ? with a dreadful shock . Instead of finding that our equipment had arrived , we held cablegrams informing us that through a misunderstanding the invaluable shipment still rested on the docks in New York . In answer to our urgent pleas , the shipping company managed to swing our instrument= onto a ship leaving New York immediately . Even so , they would not arrive in Cape Town until May 6 . Perhaps it was well that we did have extra time to repair the telescope , which had not been in use for many months . Lightning had . surged through the metal dome and wrecked the electrical circuits . Fortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. A. Rossiter , who supervised much of the erection of the telescope and observed with it for more than a quarter of a century . came out of retirement and generously volunteered to lead the way in placing the observatory again in splendid operating condition . No man helped us more with countless necessary arrangements than Dr. A. C. Hoffman , director of the National Museum at Bloemfontein . Through his efforts as well  | se of many Government and railroad 1s. our instruments were whisked from ship at Cape Town to the observatory 4 hours . e day after the arrival of our equipment aptations to the telescope were complete we were ready for action . These prepas were greatly facilitated by the ase of Mr. G. E. Burton , engineer at MIazelspoort observatory , which extended wholehearted cooperation throughout the iect . Irish Astronomer Joins Expedition Three days earlier , by previous arrangemerit . Mr. A. P.

Also greatly appre:ed was his expert brewing of tea during the long night vigils . For assistance in operating the 56-ton dome . telescope , and other equipment , I had the e services of Mr. Petrus J. J. Franzsen for st of the time and those of Mr. T. J. Adenrff and Mr. Everet Steyn for shorter periods . To our delight , weather conditions proved ceptionally favorable . In a period of 128 vs we had only five or six nights when clouds prevented photography . Every night we would cram ourselves into our little French car and drive up the hill where herds of springboks and blesboks grazed without concern in the game preserve around the observatory ( opposite ) . Wrapped in heavy overcoats and scarves as insulation against the keen night air , we directed the telescope at the blazing planet , set the clockwork going so as to keep the great magnifying glass on its objective despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant planet for visible changes of its countenance . Perched on a packing box , we often peered for hours to capture details too faint and fleeting to be caught by cameras through earth 's rippling atmosphere . If the quality of the photographic seeing promised useful results , we would bring up plate holders , attach the long , tubelike cameras in place of the eyepiece , and make highly enlarged color photographs in at least blue , green , and red light . Sometimes orange and other color filters would be used in conjunction with emulsions prepared to register a specific wave length of light . By using a movable plate carriage , we were able to make a whole series of candid-camera shots of Mars on a single plate . Since this method eliminated the necessity of stopping to change plates , it offered a reasonable chance of catching some clear , sharp pictures at a time when the earth 's atmosphere paused in its perpetual rippling across the field of the powerful telescope .

National Geographic Society Mars spends 687days traveling its eccentric orbit around the sun . able size had appeared in the desert regions of Mars . A 1939 photograph had given an earlier hint of its development ( pages 432 , 433 ) . It appeared to have the same bluegreen tint as previously known dark areas . The newly discovered marking covered an irregular area of approximately 200,000 square miles ? a little less than the size of Texas . Its center lay in Martian longitude 235 degrees and latitude 20 degrees north , near where the great Thoth Canal joins the Aquae Calidae . This wholly unexpected modification represents the greatest change observed in the geography of the planet since In 243/s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Observatory at Bloemfontein , Union of South Africa . its surface was first mapped 125 years ago . Like all the other dark regions of Mars . the new area was not uniform in appearance . but was ribbed and striated with structural details very difficult to single out because they were fused together like several pencil lines smudged over by one 's finger . I thought the striations running through the area were where known " canals " had been seen in the past , but I could not be certain . This discovery is of particular significance . because never before has a new dark patch appeared except as an outgrowth or extension of an existing dark area . Every 15 Years Earth and Mars Whirl Within 35 Million Miles of Each Other Because of the tilt of the earth , the best vantage point for observing Mars at closest opposition is in our Southern Hemisphere . North Pole South Pole We see south pole of Mars at closest opposition . Its north pole is visible at greatest opposition when Mars is 26 million miles farther from earth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outermost ado four inner planets , earth being 93miller miles from the sun , Mars an averaged 142 million . Opposition occurs when sun , earth , and Mars are in a straight line . Average time between oppositions is 236 years . The last opposition was JulyZ 1954 ; the next will be Sept. 10,1956.  | The remarkable transformation indicates that the division between desert and dark areas is not necessarily a fixed or permanent one , but that one may change to the other at any time . This in turn hints that the deserts and dark areas on Mars are neither dependent upon nor directly related to any particular type of topography or surface material or of land elevation . Green Areas Betoken Martian Life Apparently a vast area of desert can spring into sudden fertility , if in fact ? as we believe ? the darkening is due to the growth of plant life . Like vegetation on earth , these green areas turn gray , brown , or red when the Martian fall and winter come . Biologists suggest that this life may be akin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To shed further light on the subject , efforts may soon be made to grow such plants in the laboratory under the physical and chemical conditions that are thought to exist on Mars . Such green areas bear eloquent testimony to the fact that Mars is not a dead world . In fact , all the various Martian markings betoken that it is a living planet , that life of some sort exists there . If this were not so , the winds of Mars would long ago have scattered the dust and sands everywhere , rendering the whole surface the same uniform tint . Obviously it is the growing of something on , or out of , the surface which prevents Mars from becoming featureless forever . It will be most interesting and instructive to see what this new marking will look like when Mars comes into even closer opposition - 35,300,000 miles ? in 1956 . To the accompaniment of our clicking cameras , the night of 1954 's closest opposition came and went on July 2 . Two days later some of our English friends called us and exploded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fourth of July . Often we felt we were living in two worlds ? our own familiar planet , and that ruddy distant one with which we rendezvoused each night . Although Mars and the earth were now rapidly drawing apart , we continued our observations well into September , when our target became too small for useful studies . By that date more than 20,000 photographs had been obtained , most of them of such splendid quality that even preliminary study has added substantially to our knowledge . Our blue photographs showed an entirely new feature , or at least one that has never before been recognized . This was the existence of a series of faint atmospheric belts across the face of the planet . These belts , less distinct than those of Jupiter and Saturn , Through Different Filters Mars Presents a Changing Face to the Camera Just as a photographer uses color filters to penetrate atmospheric haze and reveal the landscape , the astronomer corrects his telescope camera to analyze the atmosphere and terrain of Mars .

Slipher  | A Gallery of Mars Portraits Reveals a Texas-size Green Patch Sprouting from the Desert Dark areas are permanent features of the Martian scene . In the past they have varied only in size and intensity . In 1954 , however , the author witnessed the growth of a new dark patch , indicating that such areas could spring up anywhere in the desert . Mars in 1907 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( white space ) , its moisture locked in the polar icecap . A 1939 picture ( left , above ) revealed a burgeoning of the Thoth Canal ( lower right ) , together with the extension of a green area , never seen before , across the equator into the desert . By 1954 ( right ) the new green area covered some 200,000 square miles . showed a remarkable tendency to follow the latitude circles , being generally parallel to the equator of Mars . They also showed a strong resemblance to the lines-of-flow maps constructed , from temperature measurements and drift of clouds , to represent the circulation of the atmosphere of Mars ( page 434 ) . Photographs made through the blue filter also revealed blue-white cloud patches , which kept appearing and disappearing about the Martian north pole as its autumn began . The prevalence of clouds around the winter pole , and their behavior in the colorfilter photographs , suggest that they are composed of fine ice crystals resembling those making up the cirrus clouds that float high in the earth 's atmosphere . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may descend to the polar caps in the form of hoarfrost . As if Mars wished to display its weather to us , brilliant blue-white clouds appeared in other latitudes during May and June . So changeable were they that the face of the planet was visibly altered from one night to another . Some of the yellow-filter photographs revealed large opaque " yellow clouds " that moved across the face of Mars ; they were also visible to the naked eye . These transitory clouds seem to be at least partly made up of dust . Probably the most amazing property of the Martian atmosphere is the so-called " violet haze , " which is so opaque to short wave lengths of light as to blot out completely all the surface features except the polar caps in the blue photographs . Stranger still , at another time its opaque property may disappear for a few days , and the blue photographs then will register the familiar surface features almost as distinctly as in yellow light . These clearings come on rather suddenly , are not sensible to the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several instances of this " blue clearing " have been recorded photographically at Flagstaff and elsewhere at past oppositions , and most of them occurred at or near the date of opposition . The blue clearing this year was appreciable , but , for some unknown reason , was much less typical than expected . Little , if Any , Oxygen on Mars What makes the atmosphere of Mars more opaque to blue light than is the earth 's atmosphere , and what happens to cause it to become temporarily transparent ? These are baffling questions to which , as yet , we have no satisfactory answers . Because Mars has far less mass than the earth , its force of gravity is much feebler . This fact , one of the inexorable laws of physics , constantly operates to denude the planet of  | its atmosphere . Already much water vapor and oxygen have been lost . In fact , it appears well established that very little , if indeed any , oxygen remains . In contrast , the heavier gases have remained , and there is more carbon dioxide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmospheric pressure on Mars is not known , but we estimate that it is about one-tenth that of the earth near the ground , or less than that at the top of Mount Everest . Mountain climbers well know that , as they ascend , the air thins and water boils at a lower temperature . On Mars it would boil at only 86 ? Fahrenheit , but no temperatures quite that high have thus far been recorded . We make such measurements with a vacuum thermocouple , which can measure , by means of the telescope , the heat of a candle forty miles or more away . South Polar Cap Unusually Large About noon near the Martian equator the temperature sometimes rises to 70 ? or 80 ? Fahrenheit ? like a summer day in the United States . In contrast , it may reach minus 95 ? Fahrenheit at night , and near the winter pole it stays far below zero day and night . The Martian day is very nearly the same length as ours only 37 minutes longer . On the other hand , the seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Otherwise they come and go much as they do on earth . Most conspicuous of the constantly varyMars for the First Time Reveals Atmospheric Belts Like Jupiter 's Saturn and Jupiter are noted for their conspicuous belts of clouds . Astronomers did not expect Mars to show such an effect because its atmosphere is so thin . Members of the South Africa expedition were surprised , therefore , when the planet assumed this aspect . The new feature appeared for several nights in blue photographs and then vanished . Here the cloud bands parallel the equator ; at times they angled obliquely . This picture , made by the National Geographic ? Lowell expedition , reveals a blue-white canopy hovering over the north pole ( at bottom of globe ) . Apparently it is composed of fine ice crystals like those in cirrus clouds floating high above earth . Such clouds may contain the water that descends in the form of hoarfrost to form the icecaps on the Martian poles . This wintry view shows the south polar cap stretching across 3,000 miles . A proportionate ice sheet in our Antarctic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impossible on Mars because the planet lacks water . Martian polar caps appear to be only inches thick . Like those on earth , they wax in winter , wane in summer . E. C. Slipher 434 ing features of Mars , and quite likely the key to all its changes , are the white caps covering the planet 's poles . These polar snows of Mars are frozen water , but pitifully thin . probably only a few inches in thickness and certainly not more than a few feet , compared to the thousands of feet of ice which cover Antarctica and most of frozen Greenland . When our South African observations began , the Martian south polar cap was just emerging from its long winter night , crowning the inverted image of Mars in our telescope with a jaunty spring hat . Larger than usual , the glistening bonnet was about 3,000 miles wide , and it extended over 80 degrees of latitude , covering an area greater than that of the United States . If a similar expanse had reached up to the same latitude on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bloemfontein . For a time the south polar cap was partially obscured by haze and clouds , but after the first day of the Martian spring the ice fields became clear and the entire cap started to shrink . As the south pole warmed , fissures meandered across the face , suggesting the cracked patterns in a dried-up stream bed . Green fringes seemed to form along the irregular edge of the thin , retreating ice sheet . By the time we had completed our observations , the south polar bonnet had shriveled under the rays of the summer sun to the relative size of a skullcap , while the smaller north polar c into wi appears hear tian spi to appe of Ma spreads called equator Most the sou supply north p same ei ' That that the ' th rel pola  | r cap , tipped from our view , was going o winter .

Professor Lowell believed that the socalled canals of Mars played a part in this watering process . Camera Confirms Existence of " Canals " Many astronomers have doubted the existence of these canals simply because they had never seen them during the normal course of their observations . Sometimes we were accused of drawing our Martian maps in the laboratory .

They do not meander like normal stream drainage . One runs for 1,500 miles without a bend ? half the distance across the United States . Sometimes one canal will run right through another , something no sensible river would do . Generally these delicate lines are hard to catch in photographs , but enough have been photographed successfully through the years not only to prove their reality but also to demonstrate that they change in intensity . On page 432 the 1907 photograph fails to show clearly the Thoth Canal , but in the one we made in South Africa in 1954 ( page 433 ) it stands out with an intensity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many Theories " Explain " Markings So mystifying are the Martian markings that many theories have been advanced to explain them . To me they suggest lines of vegetation along watercourses . Some believe , with Professor Lowell , that they are of artificial design . Others believe they may be fault lines along upheaved blocks of the planet 's crust . One of the most recent hypotheses is that advanced by Mr. Clyde NV . Tombaugh , discoverer of the planet Pluto , who observed at the Lowell Observatory during our absence in Africa . He thinks that Mars may have been hit by giant meteorites or asteroids ( an idea closely resembling the asteroidal bombardment theory published by Prof. J. Joly , Dublin , in 1897 ) , and that the canals may be lines of primitive vegetation that found favorable conditions in the shattered rocks along the resulting fractures . Dr. Dean B. McLaughlin , astronomy professor at the University of Michigan , has recently published the theory that the dark markings consist of dust from volcanoes situated at the points of funnel-shaped " bays , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the canals being neat windrows of volcanic ashes and the whole made more visible each spring as the Martian winds increase ? a theory that recalls the Explanation of the Surface of the Planet Mars , published in Zurich in 1909 by Mr. Adrian Baumann . INDEX FOR JANUARY-JU Index for Volume CVII ( January-June , 1955 ) of t upon request to members who bind But the absolute immobility of the dark markings of Mars , and the striking waxing and waning of certain individual features . are characteristics of the geography of Mars that are very difficult to explain by the volcanic-dust theory . And , too , one wonders why the Martian winds do not continually erase these markings of volcanic ashes by covering them with yellow dust from the surrounding deserts . The meteorite-cracking theory and the faulting theory presuppose a brittle crust and hence a molten , metallic heart and volcanic activity such as our earth has undergone . So does the volcanic-dust theory . We have no evidence as yet that Mars has undergone volcanism . Some studies indicate that volcanism can take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a borderline case . That is one reason we made such a careful series of calibrated photographs , from which we are trying to determine the size of Mars with greater exactness . To me , the best hypothesis still seems to be that the green areas represent vegetation able to grow through the yellow dust deposited upon it from time to time . In the light of our present knowledge , it appears that in Mars we are enabled to foresee what will overtake the earth in the fullness of time . Dust Covers the Face of Mars An arid waste , a vast Sahara , desertlike beyond our comprehension , covers five-eighths of the red planet . Tests in 1954 showed that much of its surface is covered with dust . So scarce is water that over the greater part of the planet there is none to quicken vegetation . Only in the blue-green areas . which respond to the advent of Martian summer and the release of moisture from the melting snow , do we see a gradual darkening in hue . All that has been learned about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller size that we behold a world in a sad state of decrepitude , still able to support a struggling form of vegetation but nearing the end of its planetary life .
