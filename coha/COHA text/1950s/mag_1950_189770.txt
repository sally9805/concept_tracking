A four-hour pounding down the tricky , debris-laden Hudson River in a bucking outboard motorboat is not every man 's idea of the way to spend Sunday morning . But to some people , it is the high spot of the year . This week 234 of such enthusiasts clambered into their tiny , buglike craft and racketed hopefully off the starting mark at Albany , in the 18th annual marathon to New York City . Of the 234 starters , 115 finished , and that was about par for the 130-mile course . <P> One spun , over and capsized at the start , several ran into driftwood and tore their hulls . Some quit with engine trouble , others gave up out of sheer exhaustion . Ordinary citizens would want a stout reward for taking the punishment the river men take , but the marathon 's prizes-an automobile , a television set and a cup-would be penny ante on a third-rate radio jackpot . The pilots of the cockleshells that whined their way down the Hudson were doing it for fun . <P> Bow Down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pint-sized ( 5 ft. 31 in. , 135 Ibs . ) August Nigl , a 33-year-old sheet metal worker of Oceanside , N.Y . Out of his savings , he had put up $400 for his black and yellow hull , Forever Amber . His Evinrude 50 h.p. engine cost another $650 . His spare time all year was spent tinkering with his engine , polishing the hull , working in endless tryouts . <P> Little Augie worked harder than most , for in 1949 he had finished second , seven minutes behind Vic Scott's* record-breaking 3:28.14 . This year Augie got a good start , right up with the pack , but soon found himself losing ground . He had gambled that the water would be rough , had loaded his forward fuel tank to keep his bow down . The water just south of Albany was calmer than he had hoped . <P> Flop Over . But 20 miles down from Albany the river roughened and Augie 's gamble began to pay off . By Poughkeepsie , the halfway mark , his boat was bouncing clean out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear that screw screaming " ) . His forward gas tank broke loose , and he had to slow down for 20 minutes while he hand-pumped gas into his after tank . But he kept going while the others were having troubles too ( " I saw one boat spin right up on its tail and flop over " ) . <P> Helped by a 3-knot ebbing tide and an 8-mile quartering wind , Nigl buzzed alone past the Coast Guard cutter Tamaroa , marking the finish opposite Manhattan 's west 80s . At first , on the assumption that he was just another sightseer , no one paid much attention to him . He circled the utter twice , waving frantically . Belatedly the marathon committee took note of the approximate finish time : 3 hours 18 minutes . It cracked Scott 's 1949 record by more than 10 minutes , for an average speed of 39.3 m.p.h . <P> <P> - This week Scott swamped at Haverstraw Bay , 30 miles from his goal .               @ @ @ @ @ @
