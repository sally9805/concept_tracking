Frank Lane , the general manager of the Cleveland Indians , moves through the world with the quiet insistence of an ambulance in full flight . People turn away from store windows and stare and hold their children up to see when Frank Lane roars by . // Things had been hopping all week in Tucson . There had been a four-day rodeo ( which , naturally enough , is called La Fiesta de los Vaqueros in Anglo-Saxon Tucson ) . A movie troupe , complete with glamour , was in town to make a cowboy movie , a " different " cowboy movie , they said , which , presumably , meant a good one . Herb Score and Mike Garcia , two of the Indians ' best pitchers , had arrived early to get in a few extra days of work at the ball park , and Score had created a flurry of small headlines around the country by appearing to be completely recovered from his eye injury . Garcia later broke his finger to sort of keep things even . Field Manager Bobby Bragan flew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd of curiosity seekers , who seemed to be waiting for Bobby to live up to his publicity and stand on his head , or at the very least to say something brash or bumptious . Later a big batch of Cleveland ballplayers came in and got promptly to work . For a few days the lobby of the Santa Rita Hotel was a glorious swirl of rodeo cowboys ( most of whom looked lean and hard and healthy ) and movie cowboys ( most of whom needed haircuts ) and ballplayers ( who , mostly , just looked ) . // Then Frank Lane arrived , and suddenly everything that happened to titillate Tucson in the week past turned to a rather mild shade of gray . // First reports held that a Vanguard rocket had blazed to a spectacular landing in the desert south of town and that Frank had stepped out , carrying a second baseman and the conversation . He fed the rocket a cube of sugar and dismissed it to pasture , deposited the second baseman in Bobby Bragan 's arms , gave the local press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one . He gave official approval to the glorious Arizona weather , said a few treasonable things about Florida ( Frank 's home is in St. Petersburg ) , analyzed the present skills and potential achievements of 47 ballplayers , smiled on the Cleveland newspapermen , who were shifting about uneasily because they had not had to ask any questions , and then subsided into a 27-second silence during which sparks crackled off his elbows and knees as he generated a fresh supply of energy . // Investigation revealed certain elements of exaggeration in these first reports . Frank actually flew from Florida in a Jupiter C rather than a Vanguard , and his landing was accomplished in the quiet of the night . The second baseman ( Milt Boiling , whom he had conned out of the Washington Senators for a string of brightly colored beads and a minor league pitcher named Pete Mesa ) was making his own way west and was with Frank only in spirit . The glorious Arizona weather that night was just plain cold , and Frank shivered publicly . The Cleveland writers did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of questions . And Frank Lane did not , then or at any time , subside into a period of silence as long as 27 seconds . // When he came into the Santa Rita lobby just before midnight , carrying a briefcase , a sweater and a coat , he had been sleepless for about 16 hours , yet he stood there talking with officials and players and sportswriters and an occasional passer-by for nearly an hour , looking as bright and cheerful as a robin after the morning 's first worm . The next day , after six hours of sleep , he caused a mild sensation by remarking , " I was pretty tired last night . " // YOUNG IN SPIRIT // The popular clich ? about Lane states that he 's 60 years old but looks 40 . Well , he is 60 ( actually he is 62 ) , and if he does n't look quite as young as 40 he certainly looks years younger than he is . But the point to be remembered is not how old or young he looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in his 30s and managed to carry the Cardinals around on his back last season , said once , " What an amazing guy Frank is . I hope I have his energy when I 'm 60 . " Then , grinning in sudden realization , he added , " Hell , I wish I had his energy right now . " // The Cleveland newspapermen , who have been starved these many years for colorful people to write about , find Lane both a delight and a caution . He was a delight because almost everything that he said or did made good copy . But he was a caution , too , because 1 ) it was hard to ask him as many as two questions in any one interview , since the first question usually set him off on an 85-yard conversational end run ; and 2 ) he sometimes moved so fast that he ran out from under newspaper coverage . That is to say that before the sportswriters can get a story into print he has another version . After this had happened to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You ca n't keep up with this man . " // Lane 's first stroll around the Indians ' training base was graphic evidence of this . He made a complete tour with Bobby Bragan as his guide . // As they walked about , a knot of sportswriters and cameramen followed . Lane was nodding , agreeing , suggesting , approving , pausing to inspect this cage or that one , posing for the photographers , talking , listening , greeting people , telling stories . // Later , after practice , Lane stood outside the small stadium and talked about Bragan and the Indians . He said he expected to make more trades before the season began and that they could have considerable effect on the team 's chances . But he said that while he 'd be disappointed if the team , as it stood at the moment , did not finish in the first division , he did not think he could reasonably expect it to finish any higher than third . // A reporter asked him about the possibility of differences coming up between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " Frank said , " I did n't hire Bragan . Hank Greenberg did . But I would have if I 'd come in when they were looking for a manager . No question about it , I would have hired Bobby . Hank asked me my opinion of him . I told Hank he could n't go wrong hiring Bobby . A manager has to have class on the field and off . And Bobby has it . // " People are always asking Bobby what he 's going to do if I start criticizing him publicly . Well , I resent them asking him that question . I do n't think it 's right . I 'll criticize Bobby if I think he 's wrong . A general manager is responsible for his manager . If he makes a mistake and I do n't like it , I 'm going to sound off . After all , he 's my man . If he goes wrong , I go wrong . What should I do if he makes a mistake ? Pretend that it 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither would the fans . // " As a general manager I 'm doing everything I can to help the manager , because I 'm selfish . I want him to win for my own sake . People do n't understand that . There was a young lady who interviewed me on a broadcast right after I had left the Cardinals to come to the Indians . ' Mr. Lane , ' she said , ' how can you be gung ho for the Cardinals on Saturday , and then turn around and be gung ho for the Indians on Monday ? ' I said , ' Because the Cardinals ' seating capacity is 29,000 and the Indians ' seating capacity is 80,000 . ' After the show she said to me , ' Mr. Lane , I do n't think you understood what I meant . ' I said , ' I understood what you meant . I do n't think you understood what I meant . This is my business . I 'm a professional . ' "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
