txt The United States , we are frequently told , should be prepared to accept its responsibilities as the world 's leading creditor nation by reducing its tradeH barriers and by lending abroad on a generous scale . Usually those who offer this advice are thinking in terms of the role played by another " creditor " nation at another stage in history . They are - thinking of - the case of Britain in the second half of the'nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth century . There are a number of- points of dif ference in these widely separated situations , and of one in particular we are reminded at more or less frequent intervals these days . This is the ( Hifi. culty encountered by investing nations in repatriating the proceeds of their investments . For example , there . is the case of Argentina at the present time . Recently Argentina announced a " liberalization " of her laws governing remittances abroad of profits from investments in that country . Under the old law , which had been in effect for about five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the investment annually . The new law raises this limit to 8 per cent . However , as the National Foreign Trade Council points out , this liberalization has little real meaning , since remittances have been shut off since 1951 by foreign exchange restrictions . But even if exchange restrictions should be lifted tomorrow ; an equallyserious obstacle would still remain . That obstacle is represented by the provision that , as the Council notes , - " any earnings in excess of 8 per cent annually shall definitely be considered national capital ' and can neither be added to- the- basic capital , on - which future remittances will be computed , nor transferred abroad . " Now , despite the use of the rather unfortuhate phrase " national capital , " this. - does not mean that all profits above 8 per cent would be nationalized or-confiscated . Rut it does mean this : Suppose an American firm with an investment of $100,000 in Argentina showed a profit of 20 per . cent , or $20,000 , on its ' operations . It could , in theory at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plow the other $12 ; 000 back into the enterprise . But this would not mean that the following year , assuming it continued to show earnings at the same rate , it could take home , even in theory , 8 per cent of its investment , now grown to $112,000 , or $8,950 ; or that the following year it could take home $10,035 , or 8 per cent of , its then accumulated investment of $125,440 . No matter what it earned in subsequent years , it would be limited to 8 per cent of the original investment of $100,000 . Short of a policy of outright expropriation , it would be difficult to see how the Argentine Government could pursue a course more effectively designed to discourage foreign investment . A corporate enterprise either grows- or it withers on the vine . And since the Argentine law offers no incentive for growth from the standpoint of the outside investor , the latter is left with only the second , and decidedly unhappy , prospect .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
