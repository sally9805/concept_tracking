ABOVE the entrance to the specially built 8,000-seat " tabernacle , " a banner proclaims : BILLY GRAHAM 'S GREATER ALBUQUERQUE CRUSADE . Despite the threatening windy weather which has dusted the nearby Sandia Mountains with the season 's first snow , some 7,000 people are already waiting in the steel and tar-paper structure-the largest indoor gathering ever assembled in Albuquerque . A Plymouth sedan drives up , and out of it steps the Rev. William Franklin ( Billy ) Graham , showman , salesman , pressagent , preacher- the hottest Protestant soul-saver since the late Billy Sunday quit the sawdust trail . Albuquerque last week had the honor of celebrating Billy Graham 's birthday : he had just turned 34 . <P> Billy Graham has taken evangelism to the tailor . He wears a jaunty sky-blue gabardine , cut full to flatter his spare figure ( 6 ft. 2 in. , 180 Ibs . ) . Accessories : a blue and white tie and square-folded white handkerchief , thick-soled , reddish-brown shoes , a cowboy belt with a silver buckle and silver tip . ( " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid , I used to think that preachers all wore black suits and long faces . " ) In his campaign posters , Billy 's face is sleekly handsome ; the reality seems gaunter and more impressive-deep-set , remote blue eyes , sharp nose and cheekbones , matted blond hair . <P> Graham is an ordained Southern Baptist , but he preaches a fundamentalist common-denominational brand of Christianity . As a teenager , Billy sold more Fuller brushes than any other salesman in his North Carolina area because he was convinced that there are no finer brushes than Fuller brushes , and his conviction was contagious . The grown-up Billy believes in a heaven &; hell as tangible as a Fuller brush . Graham likes to talk about his evangelism in Fuller brush terms : " How much of my product can I get them to take ? " <P> Billy 's theology is plain , pointed and graphic . Like a Biblical Baedeker , he takes his listeners strolling down Pavements of Gold , introduces them to a rippling-muscled Christ who resembles Charles Atlas with a halo , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample scalding . His language is a strange , original blend of farm-boy idiom , Shakespeare , the New Testament and the newest slang . Sample Grahamism , aimed at those who protest that they were raised in good Christian homes , therefore do n't need to be " converted " : " Just because you were born in a garage , does that make you an automobile ? "
