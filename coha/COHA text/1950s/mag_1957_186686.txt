Sovereignty is not a word often used in connection with a Soviet citizen . But First Party Secretary Nikita Khrushchev used it scornfully last week to describe the action of " Comrade Maximov , " chairman of the Zhdanov Coke-Chemical works , who had built an 8-ft. - high slag-block wall 3,000 ft. long ( cost : $50,000 ) to " defend his sovereignty " against the rival Azvostal factory . Although Russia 's vast socialized industry works for one boss-the State-competition between ministries , divisions and plant managements is as intense and as predatory as anything to be found in the worst Marxist fantasies of the capitalist world . <P> Comrade Maximov was a horrible example in Khrushchev 's cautious but crucial struggle with the technocrat commissars , who have been demanding less interference from boards of bureaucratic directors in Moscow , more autonomy in their plants and more control over the men under them , i.e. , more freedom , which in Russia can only mean less bother with the party hacks . Recently Khrushchev produced a much publicized scheme for the decentralization of Soviet industry that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME , April 15 ) . <P> The Unknown Man . On closer examination it was seen that the crafty Nikita had struck out 25 key industrial ministries in favor of control at regional levels , where his party hacks are strongest . Among those presumably to be abolished was the ministry of Khrushchev 's predecessor and rival , the Ministry of Electric Power Stations , run by Georgy Malenkov , who set up and top-managed the Soviet industrial might in World War II and presumably speaks for the technocrat class . <P> It is a comment on the limits of Khrushchev 's power ( compared with Stalin 's ) that the issue was debated . In the Supreme Soviet four Deputies asked for changes . A government decree announced that Khrushchev 's closest associate , Nikolai K. Baibakov , chairman of the Gosplan ( top planning commission ) , had been demoted and replaced by Iosif I. Kuzmin , a complete unknown in the hierarchy of Soviet greats . Kuzmin was known only to have graduated from engine driver to boss of a Moscow experimental production plant . His modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party power struggle except that he had been a functionary in the Moscow party organization ( Malenkov 's old stamping ground ) and that his meteoric rise resembled that of many technocrat commissars . In his new job he ranks as one of the Soviet Union 's six First Deputy Premiers ( the others : Kaganovich , Mikoyan , Molotov , Pervukhin , Saburov ) .
