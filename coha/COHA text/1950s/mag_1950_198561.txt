When the evening Atlanta Journal published a 104-page , ad-filled Thursday paper last week , it was a hefty surprise to the 250,000 Journal subscribers . The reason : only a month before , the Journal had announced that it was cutting down on advertising because of the newsprint shortage . <P> The Journal 's one-day solution was simple . Unable to buy sufficient newsprint at the contract price of $104 a ton , the Journal and the jointly-owned morning Constitution had cut their advertising 20% ( TIME , Oct. 9 ) . But they had also bought up 350 tons of newsprint on the open market at from $175 to $200 . This they offered to advertisers willing to pay the regular ad rates plus a premium to cover the high-cost paper . Several advertisers had also bought paper on their own account . For the extra 90 tons used in last week 's Journal , the space buyers had paid a $7,000 surcharge.
