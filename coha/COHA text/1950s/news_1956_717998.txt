txt President Eisenhower walked thirty painful feet with help this morning . When asked to exercise a second time this afternoon , however , he turned down the chance with the remark ; " Once was enough . " His physicians reported that , while he still was in pain and sleeping fitfully , his condition was " excellent . " They said his recovery from the emergency abdominal operation performed early yesterday at Walter Reed Army Hospital was continuing satisfactorily and uneventfully . James C. Hagerty , White House press secretary , said General Eisenhower had given routine approval this afternoon to a minor governmental deci= sion already taken by his staff . This was to postpone indefinitely a conference of prominent Americans . The President had called the meeting at the White House for Tuesday to discuss means of expanding people-topeople contact all over the world .

Mr. Hagerty said the subject had not been discussed with the President and that he doubted it would be before he left the hospital . Yesterday the board of doctors attending him said the new illness would be no physical bar to a second term . Mr. Hagerty declined to speculate on President Eisenhower 's reaction to this subject . As is the custom among sun : geons , the President 's doctors had him on his feet this morning ' within thirty hours after his operation .

Then , with the corpsmen at his elbows again , he walked back to his bed . The doctors proposed another walk in midafternoon , but the President demurred , according to Mr. Hagerty . The physicians did not press the point . Another factor causing the President discomfort isor that he still has a rubber tube running through his nostrils and down into his stomach to remove gas and waste . This is connected to a small suction machine . It was disconnected from the machine while the President took his walk . He still is being fed intravenously , and at night has been administered small doses of Demerol to help him sleep . Antibiotics also are being administered to guard against the danger of infection in the area where the operation was performed .

Mrs. Eisenhower at Bedside Mrs. Eisenhower made several trips to her husband 's bedside during the day , as did his brother . Dr. Eisenhower later left for University Park , Pa. , where he is president of the Pennsylvania State University . The President 's son , Maj. John S. Eisenhower , and daughter-inlaw , Barbara , came in briefly in mid-afternoon . This was their ninth wedding anniversary . Other than these family members and medical personnel , the only other visitors were Sherman Adams , the Assistant to the President , and Mr. Hagerty . Each remained only a few minutes . Mr. Hagerty said the doctors thought General Eisenhower might be able to transact a little more Government business tomorrow and that a staff office would be opened in the ward near his Executive suite . If anything urgent were to arise tonight , Mr. Hagerty said , it would be taken to the President at once .

They were uncertain who would sit in for the President as chairman of this meeting . Mr. Hagerty said they still were considering what to do about the proposed meeting of Presidents of the American Republics at Panama late in June , and a scheduled conference early in July with Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru of India . There were suggestions from Panama that the meeting of Presidents might be postponed until mid-July if this would facilitate attendance by General Eisenhower . His doctors have said he could resume a full work-load after convalescing four to six weeks . All the medical news today was good , and the atmosphere was one of relieved tension . Condition Is ' Excellent ' The bulletins were issued by Dr. Howard McC . Snyder , the President 's physician , Maj. Gen. Leonard D. Heaton and Dr. Isidore S. Ravdin .

The blood chemistry determinations are within normal limits . Appropriate antibiotics are being administered . He is still on intravenous feeding . " This morning the President walked with support , in his room , from his bed to an armchair , a distance of fifteen feet . He sat in the chair with his legs supported on an ottoman . While sitting in the chair , he indulged in deep-breathing exercises . He remained in the chair for about ten minutes and then walked , with support , back to his bed . " Following this exercise , his pulse rose ten beats per minute and then returned to its previous rate within two minutes after he returned to bed . " The final communiqu ? , at 5 P.

Later , in reply to questions , Mr. Hagerty said the President had been given three small doses of Demerol to help him sleep . The most important development of the day , of course , was the brief walk . Although it now is routine in most surgical cases , it caused some surprise in the news room when Mr. Hagerty announced that the President had taken a few steps . Asked why the doctors wanted the President to walk so soon , Mr. Hagerty conferred with the specialists . He came back with ' the answer that " early ambulation " was desirable to produce " general body tone . " It enhances and greatly hastens recovery , he said . He remarked that Dr. Ravdin had recalled that soldiers hospitalized and confined to their beds for as much as a week during the war had lost much of the conditioning and hardening received in seven months of basia training .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
