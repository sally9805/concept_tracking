Three miles from the city of Koto on the narrow mountain road which led to safety , encircling Communist troops had blown the only bridge across a reservoir . With the bridge gone , the 20,000 men of the 1st Marine Division and the Army 's 7th Infantry Division last week apparently had no choice but to abandon their vehicles , take out on foot and make a 20-mile detour through enemy-infested hills . <P> Had they been members of any other army the marines and soldiers would have made the detour and perhaps been annihilated in the process . As it was , even before the crucial crossing was reached , eight spans of a 16-ton bridge had been parachuted down out of the sky to the U.S. troops seemingly isolated in the midst of the enemy . Eight C-119s of Major General William H. Tunner 's Combat Cargo Command , each hauling a single span , had carried out the world 's first airdrop of a bridge . The retreating column was free to move ahead , vehicles and all . <P> Symbolically , the Combat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aerial bridge to their bases . Day after day " flying boxcars " had swung low over the column to drop ammunition , medical supplies and rations . And eight miles back up the road at Hagaru , C-475 had set down on an improvised airstrip to pick up long lines of wounded and frostbitten men . Said Combat Cargo Command Pilot Lieut . James Wood : " The marines scraped out the field at Hagaru one afternoon while we circled over it . " Every plane in Wood 's squadron was damaged by enemy small-arms fire during operations in the northeast , and on one flight Wood himself was forced to fly back to base on trim tabs after Chinese ground fire had crippled the control surface of his elevators . But in four days Combat Cargo Command lifted 2,650 casualties off the improved airstrip at Hagaru and whisked them off to hospitals in Japan . <P> " Anything , Anywhere . " What had happened in northeast Korea was proof that even in disaster and defeat the most significant element of U.S. power was mobility . In the amphibious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunning success the techniques of transporting power by sea . Those techniques were by no means obsolete , but they were faced with a formidable new obstacle . Amphibious landings on the World War II model required vast supply dumps in ports or beachheads which would present an irresistible target to an enemy with the atomic bomb . Said General Omar Bradley , not long ago : " The atomic bomb , properly delivered , almost precludes . . . another amphibious operation like the one in Normandy . " <P> Most U.S. military men agreed that greater reliance on direct air supply would be a vital supplement to sea and land transport in any major future war . The most extreme advocates of air supply maintained that it was already possible to fly combat forces to any point in the world and keep them supplied . Nobody had argued along these lines more persistently than Combat Cargo Command 's General Tunner , who believes that " We can fly anything , anywhere , any time . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
