The New Army <P> Sir : <P> Again TIME did a valuable service to the public with its cover story on General Lyman Lemnitzer and the United States Army May 11 . <P> <P> WALTER L. KNECHT Yellow Springs , Ohio <P> Sir : <P> Congratulations to General Lemnitzer . It appears that the Army is finally adopting the training standards used by the U.S. Marine Corps for years . <P> <P> MID/2C H. S. McCLOSKEY New Orleans <P> Sir : <P> It was interesting to read Sergeant Leonard T. Berry 's complaints about coffee breaks , automatic dishwashers and the fact that he ca n't get men to parade . <P> Why not go along with him and take away the automatic dishwashers and potato peelers , along with , of course , nuclear weapons , missiles and other useless innovations ? He should be very pleased to have all the men he wants for parades , and their bows and arrows or muskets slung over their shoulders . <P> <P> STEPHEN A. KROFLICH Columbus <P> Sir : <P> Having been a member of the 3rd Armored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the United States Army in September of 1958 , I have my doubts about the effectiveness of Staff Sergeant Nolen 's telephone report of trouble on the Iron Curtain border . <P> One well-placed missile in each of the casernes ( camps ) would destroy most of the tanks , trucks , Jeeps and other equipment not already inoperable from an excess of paint and polish and an absence of proper care and maintenance . <P> <P> BERNARD KAHN Elmsford , N.Y . <P> <P> West Germany Reconstructed <P> Sir : <P> May I compliment you on your wonderful coverage and the beautiful photography of spreading West Germany 's wealth May 11 ? <P> <P> CURTIS BERMAN New York City <P> Sir : <P> The picture layout on West Germany was magnificent . Pierre Boulat , in his picture of the Kurfrstendamm , has captured with a camera what the impressionists were conveying on canvas . <P> <P> MARCIA YOUNG <P> Berkeley , Calif . <P> <P> Sir : <P> Germany , a nation which for centuries has been largely responsible for all the trouble and wars in Europe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims ' blood , has received gifts and loans for their shameful acts from a country that stands for freedom and justice . <P> <P> TAD KROL <P> Chicago <P> The Heroine <P> Sir : <P> In the May 18th issue you mentioned the gallant rescue of Albert Kogler , following the shark 's attack , by Shirley O'Neill . I think we all would have said that it was the greatest exhibition of courage we had ever seen . Her kind assures America of a better tomorrow . <P> <P> BOB HEDGES Washington , B.C. <P> <P> Sir : <P> Shirley O'Neill has edified a nation . The parents of Miss O'Neill have every reason to be the proudest people on this earth today . <P> <P> CHARLES D. SHIELDS Washington , B.C. <P> <P> Congress &; Labor <P> Sir :
