The rage of Moscow this week was a lanky ( 6 ft. 4 in. ) , curly-haired Texan whose long , flashing fingers at the piano keyboard put a rare thaw into the cold war . <P> Van Cliburn , 23 , blazed through the opening round of the first Tchaikovsky International Piano and Violin Festival with 49 other pianists from 19 countries , and his twelve-note span carried him triumphantly through the second round . By then the town 's elite was on its ear . To hear him in the finals , standees jammed the aisles in the Moscow Conservatory 's deep balconies . Soldiers held back enthusiastic crowds in the street outside . To the hundreds of callers who asked for tickets , the Conservatory 's box office had a standard reply : " Cliburn is playing tonight ; call back tomorrow . " <P> Snapped String . In the finals , which matched him against eight other pianists - including three top-rated Russians and another American , Los Angeles ' Daniel Pollack , 23-the good-looking young Texan chose to play Rachmaninoff 's powerful Concerto No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played Tchaikovsky 's familiar First and a rondo by Soviet Composer ( and contest judge ) Dmitry Kabalevsky , who wrote it for the contest . <P> Despite a bandaged index finger ( which he had cut during a grueling rehearsal ) , Cliburn displayed the tautly controlled technique , the steel-fingered power and booming romantic style that had dazzled audiences in the opening rounds . Toward the end of the rondo , a piano string snapped under his bold percussive attack . He piled through the rest of the piece without faltering , rose after the final Rachmaninoff to one of the most thunderous ovations ever accorded an artist in Moscow . <P> For nearly ten minutes the bravos echoed through the cavernous hall ; finally the judges , in violation of the contest rules , permitted Cliburn to return to the stage for a second bow . Then the orchestra rose and joined the ovation . Backstage , the jurors , including famed Russian Pianist Emil Gilels , embraced Cliburn . Alexander Goldenweiser , octogenarian dean of Russian pianists , kept repeating one word : " Genius ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cliburn for four Manhattan concerts in the winter . <P> Lost Pounds . Still , with six of his rivals yet to play , Cliburn 's victory was hardly assured ; indeed , on his U.S. record , he could not have been expected to whip up such frenzy . Born in Shreveport , La. , the son of an oil executive , Cliburn grew up in Kilgore , Texas , studied the piano with his mother , a onetime concert pianist named Rilda Bee . He had no other training until he enrolled at Manhattan 's Juilliard School of Music in 1951 to study with Russian-born Teacher Rosina Lhevinne . He won the Leventritt Award for young pianists in 1954 , and as a result made his debut with the New York Philharmonic to glowing reviews . But like many another promising young U.S. instrumentalist , he promptly dropped out of sight on the smalltime recital circuit , found himself playing successful but unheralded recitals in places from High Point , N.C. to Coldwater , Mich.               @ @ @ @ @ @
