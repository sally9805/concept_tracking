A strange vehicle rolled down Denver 's Ivanhoe Street one day last week and pulled to a stop in front of No. 626 . It had once been a bus until Mrs. Ellen Harris , G.O.P. candidate for Congress in Colorado 's First District , gave it the jawbreaking name of " Congrelephant , " and made it over . From the front hung an elephant 's trunk spouting smoke . It had a tail and four-foot ears , and big blue eyes were painted on the windshield . To the housewives of Ivanhoe Street , the Congrelephant was not nearly so exciting as a simple black Chrysler limousine that pulled up 15 minutes later . The limousine brought Mamie Doud Eisenhower to do some politicking for her friend Ellen Harris . <P> Mamie smiled her way through some 200 persons spilling around the sidewalk ( mostly women and children ) and entered the Congrelephant . She pinned a Harris-for-Congress button on her coat and began to shake hands with the women crowding into the bus , which had been redone into a sort of traveling living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert M. Johnson , who brought her son Randy . " You do n't know what this means to us , " she gushed . " You see , Randy was born the day Ike was elected President . " He got a hug from the President 's lady . Two teenage boys stuck their heads in the rear window and shouted : " Hey , Mamie , how about your autograph ? " She obliged . The volunteer workers serving coffee and doughnuts had a bad case of nerves . One confessed later : " My knees were so weak that I was afraid I 'd pour coffee on the First Lady . " Diet-conscious Mamie was a little unsettled herself by the doughnuts , but reached for one reluctantly ( " Oh dear me , I would take the one with the most sugar " ) . <P> Later , outside the bus , Mamie slipped her arm around Candidate Harris ' waist and made her first solo political speech of the campaign . It would also be a big boost in Mrs. Harris ' uphill fight to unseat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mamie , " I hope you 'll all vote for her . We women have to have a voice in things . " The home movie cameras ground away , and people with Brownies worked furiously while Mamie met a dachshund pup named Ike , told him : " Why hello , Ike , I 'll tell Ike I saw you today . " She shook more hands and gave more autographs in a big , scrawling hand . When she climbed into her limousine , she was still clutching her doughnut . A thoroughly captivated crowd watched her wave it as the car pulled away .
