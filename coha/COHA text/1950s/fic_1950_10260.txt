3SHE WOULD leave him , she thought , as soon as the petuniashad bloomed . With a decisive feeling of happiness , she set down her trowel and sank back on her heels to rest . Around her lay the brown earth of the converted vegetable garden , a slightly lopsided rectangle , across which careened the flower seedlings in rows that were both neat and unsteady , so that the whole planting , seen from a distance , looked like a letter written by a childp 4who has lost his ruler . If only , she reflected , she had done it the way the book said and marked out the rows with stakes and string . Next year . . . Her heart turned over with horror as she perceived the destination of her thought . She had done it again . Next year , of course , she would not be here . She had been telling herself this for five weeks , yet she could not seem to remember it . Left to itself , her idle mind reached out lazily , unthinkingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strayed toward a pomegranate seed . She remembered all the times she had thought of leavinghim before . But there had always been something  --  the party Saturday night that she did not want to miss , the grapes blue on the vines waiting to be made into jelly , the new sofa for the living room that Macy 's would delivernext week , the man to see about the hot-water heater . And by the time the sofa had come , the man had gone , the jelly had been made , she would no longer be- angry with him , or at any rate her anger would have lost its cutting edge and she would have only the dull stone of discontent to turn over and over in her palm . Now , however , it was settled , this problem that had been agitating her since April , since the morning she had planted the sweet peas instead of packing her suitcase , as she ought of course to have done when he had uttered the unspeakable sentence . Now she had actuallyp 5set a date for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not simply on the calendar of her heart , where the years were written as days and it seemed always a matter of a few weeks at most before she would be back with her friends , a returned traveler with a fresh slice of life in her hands and many stories to tell . She had been trying since April to do it , all the while that she went on with her digging and watering and weeding , trying to imagine the flowers in their places in August and herself not there to see them , herself in New York in a hot furnished room . It was a little like imagining her own death , but there had been mornings when she had been almost able to do it , and then she would set down her tools and say to herself in surprise , Why , I can leave tomorrow . There is nothing to keep me here . Always , however , she would have forgotten the petunias , which were growing in flats inside the house and had therefore not fallen under her eye . Suddenly they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with yellow throats , blocked out in squares , alternating with squares of blackish red zinnias , with the heavenly blue of the scabiosa making a backdrop of false sky behind them ; her heart would contract with love and despair as she saw that she could not leave them  --  she was in bondage unless they should die . But to acknowledge this was to feel panic . Speaking to her of time and the seasons , the garden urged her top 6hurry , to go now , before it was too late , before the wheel , turning , should carry her once again on its slow journey through birth , reproduction , and death . Now for the first time she began to count the weeks . Her sensibility quiveredin a continual anticipation of change ; she took offensereadily , pushed everything to extremes , and , in her mind , renounced her friends , her house , her china , a dozen times a day . Desperate measures occurred to her : if she were to kill the petunias . . . ? Petunias are peculiarly subject to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . She would stare at the pitcher of ice water on the luncheon table as the heir stares at the bottle of sleeping medicine by the bedside of his aging relative . But always her resolution softened ; the grotesque temptation passed , and , trembling , she would slip out of the house , quietly , lest her husband hear her and detain her on some pretext ( for he considered that she was working too hard , complained that he never saw her , that her temper was being ruined ) ; she would collect the trowel , the spading fork , the hand cultivator , and let herselfinto her enclosure , fenced off against rabbits and woodchucks , and there begin once again her penitential exercise , her agony in the garden . " Why do you do it if it gives you no pleasure ? " her husband would ask . " Do n't pretend you are doing it for me . " She knew no answer to this ; only once she had p 7turned on him , saying , " Ah , you hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it all go to ruin . " And truly she did not understand why she was doing it , unless it was somehow against him . It was as though she owed these plants some extra and conspicuous loyalty to make up to them for his jealous hostility , which was always waiting its chance , alleging urgent business , sexual desire , anything , to keep her within doors . Sometimes it seemed to her that she stayed on simply as the guardian and defenderof these plants , to which she stood in a maternal relation , having brought them into existence . At other times it was cruder . She would not , she would tell herself grimly , give him the satisfaction of seeing her lose the investmentof work and love she had made in this rich but difficult soil . She had made a mistake , she knew it ; the nurseryman had warned her , " You 're biting off more than you can chew . " Now she would pause occasionally to look out at the weeds swaying in the light spring wind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they grew taller , fiercer , more luxuriant than they did in the field itself . It was as if the field were a hostile sea which billowed and swelled in the distance with a sort of menacingcalm , and spent itself vindictively in that last breasthighgreen wave which it launched upon her rectangular island . At such moments , dread would seize her ; she would shudder and turn back to her task , knowing that 8every minute must be made to count , lest she be inundated , her work and tools be lost in this watery jungle of nature . And always it was as if he were the ally of the weeds  --  he was fond of telling her , pedantically , that there was no botanical distinction between a weed and a flower . On mornings when she would hurry out after a rainy spell to find her brown space green with a two-day crop of wild mustard , she would feel him to be nearly victorious ; tears of injury and defiance would stand in her eyes as she scratched the ground with the claw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been so , when her borders had been gay with simple clear colors , pink and scarlet , lemon yellow and cornflower blue , when her husband had stood by in admiration , saying , " You have green thumbs , my dear . " Then she had been ready enough to lay down her tools , to greet a friend , to go on a picnic , to give an order to her maid ; then there had been summer afternoons when he sat on a bench with a drink while she let the hose play gently over the flower beds and stopped from time to time to take the glass from him and sip . Later , kneeling out in the garden , she would try to decideat what moment the change had come . When she had declined to go with him to the city because there was no one to water the flowers ? When he had bought the dog that rooted up the tulips ? Ah no , she thought . It had 9been inevitable from the beginning that the garden should have become suffused with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original lenten magenta , for everything returns to itself and a marriage made out of loneliness and despair will be lonely and desperate . And if I have a gardento console me , you will have a dog , and your dog will destroy my garden , and so it will go , until all good has turned to evil , and there is not a corner of life that has not been flooded with hatred . It had become meaningless to draw up lists of grievances ( her picture torn across the middle and thrown in the kitchen wastebasket ) , for to have a grievance is to assert that some human treaty has been violated , and they were past treaties , past reparations , past forgiveness ; to invoke love , morality , public opinion was pure simony  --  in every belligerent country the priests are praying for victory . How far it had gone she had never perceived until yesterday . She was repeating the flower names to herself : black boy , black ruby , honesty , mourning bride ( ah yes , she murmured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , purity , and last of all the free package thrown in by the seedsman which was designated Peace . Dear God , she had exclaimed , it 's as if I were growing flowers for a funeral blanket . Is it possible that I wish him dead ? And at once the vision of herself as a young widow slipped into her fancy , like a view into an old stereopticon . She saw her-p 10self pale and beautiful in black , murmuring repentant phrases to some intimate woman friend . ( It 's true that we did n't get along , but I could n't have wished this to happen . I am sorry now for everything , and I would like to be able to tell him so . If only he could have known that I loved him after all . ) Yes , she thought , if he were dead , I could love him sincerely . And how practical it would be ! She would not have to give up anything  --  the Spode salad plates , the garden , the candy-striped wallpaperin the living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the roasting pan or leave it ( it had belonged to her in the first place ) . All the objects she had nearly determined to relinquish if she were to leave him , all these things she considered already lost , would be restored to her . And she could move about among them alone ; she could have everything the way she wanted it , there would be no one to stop her , no one to say , " Why do we have to have a soup and a salad course ? You are spending too much money . " That was the queer thing , she thought ; it was not a question of money . If he died , he would leave her nothing ; the commissions would stop automatically , there would not even be any insurance . What he would do for her by dying would be to relieve her of the necessity of decision . How many women , she wondered , had poisoned their husbands , not for gain or for another man , but out of sheer inabilityp 11to leave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weed-killer is in the soup ; the man is in his coffin . One regrets , but now it is too late ; the matter is out of one 's hands . Murder is more civilized than divorce ; the Victorians , as usual , were wiser . Really , she said to herself , I will have to get away if I am going to have such thoughts . And a dreadful presentimentflicked her heart , lightly at first , like the stroke of a lady 's riding whip . What if I were to go in now and find him dead by his work table with the blueprints spread out before him ? She saw , as if by second sight , what her remorse would be and knew that she could not bear it . In a moment she was stiff with fright . Clearly , she would have to go and look for him , but she could not move . Look , she said to herself , if he is dead the maid will come to tell me sooner or later . I do not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was useless . By now she was certain that he was dead ; one last hope , however , remained . If she were to get there quickly enough . . . She found herself running down the driveway . Outside his window she stopped . It was too high for her to see in . See , she said to herself , almost happily , perceiving the difficulty , there is nothing you can do . But a stratagem occurred to her . By a supreme effort of will she made herself pull up an orange crate and climb onto it . She looked in . There he was at his table , motionless ; she could p 12not make out whether he was breathing . For the first time , she saw him with detachment , a man in a brown suit slumped over some papers , like a figure drawn by a painter and left there , a figure unknown , without history , and yet intensely itself . He moved , and was human again ; she knew him , she disliked him ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deep breath and slipped quickly down from the orange crate , before he should turn his head and see her . All afternoon in the garden she kept congratulatingherself , fondly , hysterically , as people do when they have had , or believe they have had , a narrow escape . Yet when he came out at five to call her and startled her by approaching quietly , she gave a long , piercing , terrible scream , a scream that seemed to linger in the air long after she had left the garden . In some way , he had caught her red-handed . This morning , in the garden , the scream was still there . Overnight , delay had become dangerous . A break must be made . The part of her that put up preserves , built terraces , laid in oil for the winter , would have to come to terms at last with the part that knew the train schedules by heart and kept a ten-dollar bill hidden in its jewelry box . A path would have to be cleared through the thicket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not , after all , essential that she should choose the thorniest way . If she could not renounce the petunias , p 13she would have them and then go . The important thing was that she should not make a single plan that would carry her beyond the first of August . Resolutely , she picked up her trowel and stabbed it into the ground , next to a clump of nut grass with its bright , spearlike leaves . Probing carefully , she lifted the plant and saw with satisfaction that the nut was there , dangling from the long root . The point about nut grass was that you must be sure to get the nut ; otherwise your pains were wasted  --  within a week the plant would be up again . Hoeing was out of the question ; you had to dig , with a spading fork or a trowel . " Why do n't you give it up ? " her husband had asked , indifferently , when she had showed him the thousands of green spears of the grass pricking the ground she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she had answered , and yet , often , this was what she most wanted to do , to give up and lie down on her bed and never make another effort , to sleep and have her meals brought up and live like a weed herself , silent and parasitic . But always the flowers pressed their claims ; she would picture a few starved cosmos plants waving their thin heads among the tall grasses , and she would feel her heart wrung , as if squeezed out by those strong inimical brown roots . Ah well , she said to herself now , next year will be another matter . Next year nature can have her way . Thank God , at any rate , I did not put in any perennials. p 14All the rest of the morning she worked along cheerfully . When her maid 's voice called her in to lunch , she got up with docility . Walking along the lane , she noticed that the wild lilies of the valley were nearly in bloom . There was a shady space along the veranda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the blossoms should , by next year , double in size . . . . Some plants with a good chunk of earth were already in her hands when she perceived what she was doing . " My God , " she murmured , " my God , " and dropped the plants back into the hole her trowel had cut . She pressed the earth down around them and trod on it with her foot . It had been a close shave , and the beating of her heart informed her , bluntly , that she must run no more risks . The whole property was pitted with traps for her ; she walked in danger and there was no time to lose . In the hotel , the door had not closed behind the bellboywhen she picked up the telephone . She had no plans . Her imagination , working ( how long ? ) in secret , had carried her only this far ; she had conceived of the future , simply , as a hand , still wearing its glove , reaching out for a hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . This was a possibility she had not counted on . In all her calculations , it was she who had been the doubtful element , she the expected , the long-overdue relation whose p 15homecoming was hourly anticipated , she the beloved sisterwhose room had been kept just as she left it ; and throughout the term of her marriage , the thought of her friends had jabbed at her conscience : they were waiting and could not understand what could be keeping her so long . Now , at the fifth attempt , she put down the receiverperemptorily , to cut off the drilling , importunate sound that her call , unanswered , was making . For a diversion , she drew a bath , saying to herself that it was still too early , that people were out of town for the summer , that one could not expect , et cetera . Yet , after the bath was over , she did not know what to put on , for she both counted and did not count on an invitation to dinner . To her sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her friend , that she was in town ; could she come Thursday for dinner ? Thursday was four days off , and she fumbled a little in accepting . Her great news had become suddenly undeliverable . The context was wrong , yet the news remained , almost sensibly , in her mouth , thickening her tongue . She hung up in haste , lest her disappointment be audible on the other end of the wire . On her seventh call , she was informed that the party had moved to Connecticut ; on her eighth , she made a date for lunch on the following day . She was conscious of her own folly in withholding her announcement ; she needed help , a job , money , reassurance , but she could not break through the fence ofp 16social forms she found erected against intimacy . In these five years , she perceived , she had become a visitor , the old friend from out of town who is at the Biltmore for a few days ; in her absence , the circle had closed ; the hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not part to readmit her to the dance . They had forgotten her , forgotten , that is , her former self , which remained green only in her own memory ; for her alone , time had stood still . She left the telephone and began , reluctantly , to dress . Half an hour later , in the hotel dining room , a man eyed her , and though she bent her head strictly over her dinner , her mind vacillated , wondering whether a stranger might not . . . Discretion , however , warned her that she could pay too high a price for a listener . I must be strong , she said to herself , and , slightly reassured by this small victory , yet shaken by the need she saw in herself that had exposed her to so commonplace a temptation , she paid her check . Back in her room , her magazines exhausted , she picked up the Gideon Bible and read doggedly through Kings and Chronicles , and at last fell asleep . When she woke , it was too early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and read the help-wanted columns . There was nothing there for her . By ten o'clock her sense of flatness and embarrassment had grown so large that she could not bring herself to telephone anyone who p 17might be able to get her a job . The inevitable question , the Why , stood ahead of her , bristling with condolence and curiosity ; she was not ready for it . Better , she said to herselfsuddenly , to go to an agency , where no personal explanationswere required . In ten minutes she was at RockefellerPlaza , with the list of her qualifications ready on her tongue . But the sight of the Victory garden , the rows of young radishes , made her own garden take shape before her , like a sin she had forgotten to confess . Oh God , oh God , she said to herself , I am unfit  --  who will hire me ? And it seemed to her that she had not gone far enough ; she must discard her whole identity . An inspiration seized her : she might hire herself out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a maid 's room in the third story of a house in Pelham , saw the bed with the thin blankets and the lumpy mattress , the bath shared with the baby , or the lavatory in the basement . All the wretched paraphernalia of domestic service became invested with glamour for her  --  she might lose herself and be saved . If she were to go down to Fourteenth Street now and buy herself a cheap dress and some shoes , by tonight she might have a situation . She could leave her own clothes in the hotel room , and when he came to find her , he would find merely Bonwit Teller , Mark Cross , hat by John-Frederics , fragranceby Schiaparelli . She was already , in her mind , selecting the shoes for her new life ( patent leather withp 18bows which would do for her day out , or sensible , flatheeledblack ? ) , when some part of her , her conscience or her good sense , warned her that it would not do . It was a child 's dream of revenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Regretfully , she relinquished the adventure . Yet , she said to herself , I must do something ; by tomorrow I shall be out of money . In her handbag were the few pieces of jewelry she had inherited from her mother . It occurred to her that this was perhaps the moment to sell them ; after lunch , with cash in her pocket , she could approach the agencies with more assurance . She walked briskly up toward Fifty-ninth Street , feeling herself lifted once again by that wave of exultation that had brought her down from the country . She was free again , if only for a few hours ; all decisions , commitments , were postponed . It was as though the old-gold and diamond shop which she entered presently were the last station in her flight ; passing the jewelry over the counter , she divested herself of her last possession ; the appraiser counted her out a hundred dollars , and she no longer had anything to lose . She stuffed the money into her pocketbook and hurried back to the hotel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breaking her lunch date and asking her to call back . At once , her elation vanished . The day stretched empty ahead of her . She turned quickly back to the street and found a Ham- p 19burger Heaven , where she ate lunch . Afterward , she went to the movies , and when she returned to her room she did not telephone anyone , but lay on her bed reading the Gospel according to St. Matthew until she felt it to be late enough to go to sleep . She had eaten no dinner . The third day passed off in much the same way : again the movies , and at night the Bible . On the morning of the fourth the telephone waked her , and she knew at once that it would be he . " Well , " he said , " I found you . " " Yes , " she said . " It was n't so hard . " " No , " he replied shortly . " Will you come down and have breakfast with me ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he retorted , and hung up . When he called up that night , he was not sober , and it was she who hung up . She had seen nobody since her arrival . Since the first night she had eaten nothing but hamburgers , and sandwiches at drugstore counters . Notice of any sort had become painful to her : she was unequal to a headwaiter or a desk clerk ; she passed in and out without leaving her key ; she felt both conspicuous and obscure . She had gone to a single employment agency and filled out an application . Outside the door , she realized that she had forgotten to note down her previous experience , but she could not go back . She was hiding and waiting , both for him and for someone else , some friend or stranger who would come to help her in response to an appeal she had never made . She was livingp 20a state of peculiar expectation , as though she had put an ad in the newspaper , an ad of the most total purport , which God perhaps might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , written out in the hotel 's violet ink and shoved under her door , was not of an ordinary social nature . Yet this sense of expectancy , of extravagant , unreasonablehope , had for its corollary during these days a strange will-lessness , an attitude of resignation and desspair . She knew that it was absolutely necessary that she should bestir herself ; her money would soon run out and she would be locked out of her hotel room . Yet she found that she actually looked forward to this catastrophe as a means of release ; the credit manager might yet be the Saviour , who , as holy legend tells us , appears in strange disguises . She was , it seemed to her now , utterly at the mercy of chance : a notice of eviction might precipitateher future out of the solution in which it was suspended  --  sheherself was powerless . In her present state , even her flight appeared to her to have been an act of supreme daring ; she could not imagine how she could have summoned up the firmness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to herself , if she could have foreseen the outcome , she would never have taken the last drastic step , but held it forever in reserve , a threat and a promise  --  and died , after thirty years of marriage , thinking how differentp 21her life might have been had she left him . What folly , she cried , what madness ! She had exchanged the prison of the oppressor for the prison of the self , and from this prison there was not even the hope of escape . At six o'clock Thursday evening , she had not decided what to wear for dinner , a long dress or a short . She put two dresses on the bed , but the arguments for each were unanswerable , and at six-thirty she went out and walked untilshe found a Western Union office , where she sent a telegram of excuse to her hostess , knowing , as she did so , that she was cutting her last line of communication to the world , to the past , to the future . Yet when he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a faint hope began to ruffle her spirit , like a sea breeze on an August afternoon . If he had given up and returned to the country , something might still be salvaged . She had seen her resolve melt away in these long mornings in the hotel room , and she knew that she was no longer proof against him ; if he were to summon , she would obey . With the dissolution of her belief in herself , her case against him had collapsed . Yet , if he were to abandon her , she knew that she would endure , simply because , physically , she was alive and possessed of a certainnegative fortitude . Eventually she would go out , she would telephone , get a job , and gradually circumstances would knit a new web around her , as scar tissue will formp 22over a wound , even if the surgeon has not been called to take the proper stitches . On this sixth day , as the morning passed on and the telephone still did not ring , she felt her spirits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surely he must be gone , she said to herself , and now I am really up against it and perhaps it will be fun after all . The sense of being under surveillance was passing off , and she dressed quickly , in her best white dress , black shoes , and large black cartwheel hat . Nothing , she told herself confidently , is more urban than black and white in summer . It was three o'clock and she had had nothing to eat , but the emptiness of her stomach only added to her fine sense of lightness and bravery . The sound of her heels on the stone floor near the elevator was brisk and pleasing , she let her handbag swing gallantly on her bare , tanned arm . For the first time , on pressing the button , she knew preciselywhere she was going  --  to call on an old friend who had an important job in an advertising office  --  and she knew , furthermore , that it was going to be all right , that he would compliment her and take her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , over the second drink , an opening would come which would allow her to tell him , quite naturally , quite easily , that she had left her husband . When he would press her  --  gently  --  for a reason , it would be merely a question of finding the right formula , ofp 23avoiding vindictiveness on the one hand and piety on the other , of packing the truth into some assimilable capsule which her companion could swallow without any noticeablediscomfort . As the elevator descended , a sentence spoke itself for her ( I would have left him long ago if it had n't been for those damned petunias ) . This was the right note , she recognized at once , seeing in advance the effect it would make in her friend 's face , where the strugglebetween incredulity and belief would resolve itself in laughter . She foresaw a whole train , a lifetime , of these sentences . ( But you say you left him five days ago ; what have you been doing ever since ? I 've been lying in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling herself on home territory . She was back at her port of embarkation , which she had set forth from five years before , back to her native patois , where jest masks truth but does not deny it . The elevator doors opened and she saw her husband sitting in the lobby . Two days later , he unlocked the door of the house and gave her a slight shove forward , as though she were a dog or a truant child . Her first impression was that the house had in a week grown older and shabbier . She stood in the doorway of the living room , looking about her with the eyes of an observant stranger . She noted the paintp 24peeling on the window frames , the place where the wallpaperhad been patched and the stripes did not quite meet , the blue chair that had never belonged there in the first place , the stain where her own head had rested on the back of the sofa . Two rather tacky-looking bouquets of bridal wreath stood on the marble-topped coffee table which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they said Welcome Home in the floral language of her maid . Generally , when this kind of thing happened to her , when a room or the face of a lover did not measure up to memory , she would narrow her eyes , as she did to look at herself in the mirror , till the focus had changed and the image become a little blurred ; then , with the quick hand of fancy , she would bestow a few decorations on the object  --  abowl of flowers , a glass cigarette box  --  a look of irony , or a smile ; and in a few moments all would be well , the face or the room would have subsided , and her eyes , now wide open , could run over it with love . This time , however , though she narrowed her eyes out of force of habit , nothing of the sort happened ; the room became dimmer but it did not reassemble itself . " Well , " said her husband , rather heartily , in his business-as-usual tone , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so patly that she made the mistake , fatal in marriage , of speaking to him as an intimate . " Does it ? " she asked . " Really ? It looks queer to me . The colors look as if some-p 25body had mixed black in them . Do you suppose she has changed the light bulbs ? " " Do n't be silly , " he said , sweeping her ahead of him toward the staircase . " Why should she do that ? " " Let 's have dinner right away , " he added , pushing her slightly again , as though he had expected her to express some morbid and contradictory wish . She obeyed him , mechanically , as she had done ever since she had seen him sitting in the hotel lobby . Her defeat seemed to her shameful and absolute . Fortunately , however , her feelings had died in her ; there was no rebelliousness , no resentment  --  in the conquered country , the officials conferred quietly with the captors and the undergroundmovement slept . What troubled her all evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighting . Across the table in the dining room , she could barely see her husband'sface , though the customary twelve candles were burning . In the middle of the meal , she excused herself and got up to turn on the electricity . This was not an improvement ; now her husband 's face appeared to be unnaturallywhite . The food also seemed to her to have been tampered with . Her husband was eating with apparent relish ; still , she could not disabuse herself of the idea that there was something wrong  --  perhaps the maid had forgotten to put the sherry in the stew ? " You are tired , " said her husband warningly , and she accepted this ex-p 26planation with gratitude . After dinner , nevertheless , she could not restrain herself from going around to each of the lamps to see if there might be dust on the bulbs . But her finger came off clean . In the morning , the visual derangement persisted . Her eye was caught , on waking , by a window shade which had been white when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was certainly ivory . Slightly frightened , she closed her eyes and took refuge in sleep . When she woke , it was to the light sound of the glass bell calling her to lunch , and to an instant conviction of disaster . There was something wrong , something she had forgotten , something more than the persistent queerness of the light or the fact of her being back once again in her husband 's bed . But her memory would not yield it up until , during a pause in the lunchtime conversation , she happened to glance out the window and saw on the sill the boxes containing the dead petunias . Her husband heard her gasp and his eyes followed hers . " What 's the matter ? " he said . " Nothing , " she replied . " Something I remembered . " He did not pursuethe topic , and later , when he asked the question ( " Have you been out yet to look at your garden ? " ) , she perceived , with relief , that he was unaware of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of politeness , a bone tossed to the idiosyncrasies of her taste . He was still going through the motions of treat-p 27ing her , rather nervously , as a guest , but his heart was plainly not in it , for he did not trouble to wait for her answer . For her , however , the question had a more fateful sound . She knew at once that she ought at least to go out and look , yet she put it off , for a day , for two days , while she did nothing but lie on her bed , declining to go to the market , plan the meals , make the French dressing , sleeping from time to time , as she had done in the hotel , and waking always with that terrible start of knowledge that tells us , as we come out of ether or alcohol , that something has changed in our lives , though we are not yet sure what it is . If her husband 's question had not been repeated a second and a third time , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly unbearable effort that took her into the toolshed for her trowel and cultivatorand sent her slowly down the garden path to the enclosure in the fields . But the third time his question had had an anxious perplexity in it . Her avoidance of the garden had begun to seem to him abnormal ; his mind must be set at rest . For ( it had become more and more apparent ) he had no comprehension at all of the events of the past week . He imagined that the whole affair was a sort of triumph , that he , the conquerer , guardian of the hearth , had pursued the fugitive nymph and wooed and bullied her home by the sheer force of his will . It had 28not occurred to him for an instant that the collapse was interior , that , like France , she had fallen , limp , corrupt , disgraced , into the arms of the victor , and so long as he did not perceive this , she had a little bargaining power left . But for the preservation of the illusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should have no suspicion of the docility that placed her , not only at his mercy , but at the mercy of every event . Her long hours in her room she had excused on the grounds of emotional exhaustion , but this could hardly be expected to last forever . Already he had begun to look a little critically at the meals , to run a finger over a table that had not been dusted  --  the holiday , his voice indicated , was over . And now , as she passed his window , she knew that the sound of her footsteps were reassuring to him ; it signified the return to normalcy , the resumption of hostilities . The garden had waited too long , she warned herself ; she was too late . Common sense alone could tell you what you might expect to find if you left a garden alone for ten moist days in June . She was prepared for the worst . Yet halfway down the path apprehension gave place to hope , and she began to run , as though this final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though she might catch the garden in the moment of transformation , effect a last-minute rescue in the very 29teeth of probability . The garden , however , was gone . Her first impression was that it had disappeared without a trace . In ten days the weeds had swallowed it . The brown enclosure had turned green ; the very markers that indicated the rows had vanished , and of the whole enterprise only the fence remained , an absurd testimonialto the fact that this rectangle had been , at one time , the scene of human endeavor . With the first shock , she closed her eyes : this was the nightmare vision she had wrestled with all spring , a ferocious tableau vivant entitledThe Triumph of the Weeds , which had appeared again and again to halt her on the road to freedom , to harrow her susceptibilities and appeal to her pity and love . She had turned back before it a hundred times , and when at length she had hardened her heart , she had told herself , I will not be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all as she had imagined it , except that the season was not so far advanced and she was here in the midst of it , while the hot furnished room was distant beyond desire . When she opened her eyes again , it was not with the hope of finding some mitigating circumstance , but rather with a kind of morbid appetite to embrace the full details of her disaster . Now she made out the individual weeds , and she saw that while in the field outside there were buttercups and a few daisies already open , here , in her enclosure , flourished only the most virile , the mostp 30virid , the most weedlike weeds , the coarse growers  --  burdock , thistle , milkweed , Queen Anne 's lace ; the crawlers  --  carrotweed , Jill-run-over-the-ground , and especiallythe choking nut grass , which crawled beneath the earth 's surface and sprouted fiercely above it . No doubt , she said to herself , there was some natural ex planation for this  --  the rankest weeds were perhaps th strongest and their seeds had a longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her heart accepted the phenomenon as a judgment and a curse . It is hopeless , she murmured to herself , leaning against the fence , hopeless ; and for the first time her spirit made an acknowledgment of defeat that was not provisional in character . Up to this moment there had been in her mind small recesses of hope to which her thoughts had fled secretly , unavowedly ; in her contract with reality , an escape clause which permitted her to believe that what had been done was not irretrievable , that  --  in this case  --  dry weather might have retarded the weeds or some magic helper hoed for her ( her maid , a thoughtful neighbor , a small boy employed by her husband ? ) ; now solidly before her lay the brutal fait accompli , the lost garden , irrecoverable , for though something might still be salvaged ( a few gray cornflower plants could be made out in the mat of vegetation at her feet ) , the original design , the mirror of absolute beauty in which she had glimpsedp 31her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground and sat looking about her . Quite simply a sentence came to her and she spoke it aloud : " Now , " she said , " I have nothing to live for . " The patent absurdity of these words acted as an astringent . The voice of common sense spoke again , saying , After all , you have a life expectation of at least forty years and you have got to do something with your time , you can not just go to pieces , and in any case peopledo not live for gardens , but for ideals , principles , persons . This particular garden is ruined , but it is still possible to transplant . A second-best garden can be made out of the cornflowers , the zinnias , the cosmos , perhaps even the scabiosa . You can move the stronger plants and in August you will have flowers on the table . She presentedthis idea to her emotions and waited for the familiar bustle of activity , the rolling back of the sleeves , which turned her heart on such occasions into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an evening party . But the motors of anticipation remained cold . The second-best garden could not , even momentarily , command her belief . Like an adopted child , or a second husband , it could never make up to her . The weeds had finished all that . The weeds were , in fact , her garden , the end product of her activities , and the white foam that children call spit , which she saw clinging to the youngp 32grasses , was the outward mark of her disease . She remainedsitting on the warm ground , idle , without thought or feeling , but ashamed to go back to the house . This time she heard her husband 's footsteps approaching , but out of pride she would not look up , even when she felt him stop just behind her at the entrance to the garden . " Gosh ! " he said . " What an awful situation ! " " Yes , " she answered defiantly . " It 's ruined . " There was a silence during which she imagined him to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and she spun around to face him . The language of their old quarrels rose to her lips , the classical formulae of accusation and outrage . ( See what you have made me do , you wanted this to happen , you are glad ) , but she was arrested by the expression of his face , which was neither jubilant nor indifferent , but full of simple curiosity and wonder . The weeds had finally made their impression on him ; never before had he really believed in them ; he had considered them to be a chimera of her dark imagination . Now he stood awestruck by this fearful demonstration of their authenticity , and for the first time the two of them shared in silence a single emotion . " What is that awful stuff ? " he asked at length , bending down to pull up a spear of nut grass . The root broke off in his inexperiencedhands , " Not that way , " she said . " Look . " Her trowel came up with the nut secure . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He examined it , turning it over between his fingers in his methodical way . " Why , it 's a little bulb , " he said . It was not worthwhile to correct this statement ; to make the botanical distinctionbetween a bulb and a tuber might simply provide a distraction from the mood of repugnance and terror that had brought them close for a moment . She longed to rush him ahead with her into the particulars of her loss , to say , See what I have been up against , see the sorrel , the field grass , the carrotweed , see where the sweet peas would have been , see where I dug the trench and strewed it with manure , think of the liming and the watering and weeding ; she was filled with a kind of wild excitement and joy that he , who had never acknowledged the garden in life , should meet it , as it were , posthumously , and pay his respects . Yet prudence or tact restrainedher . The work of initiation could not be hurried . He stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wide feet in their brown shoes were planted on one of the surviving cornflowers , as though to illustrate the text of his inculpation  --  but he must not be pushed . It was enough that he should share , however vaguely , her burden of loss , that her bereavement should to some measure be accepted as his . She waited , half-frightened , halfexalted , for what he would say next . " Gosh ! " he repeated , with intensified feeling , and p 34now she was sure it was coming , the miracle she expected , which might take the form of an embrace , a cry , an apology , but which would be in essence a lament , not so much for the garden as for her , for the dead young lady he had brought back from New York , whom he kept propped up in bed , at the breakfast table , on the sofa , in the odor of corruption . " You have your work cut out for you , " he said . For an instant she believed that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy to help you , " he continued in a matter-of-fact tone . It was over , she knew it at once , yet she made a last appeal . " The garden is ruined , " she said in a stubborn , hostile voice , but speaking slowly and emphatically as though to direct his attention to the importance of this statement . " Nonsense , " he replied briskly . " You are always so extreme . I 'll call up Mr. Jenkins tomorrow and see if he can send . . . " At the mention of the neighboring farmer , her mouth opened and she began to scream . " I 'll kill you if you do ! " she shouted . Picking up the spading fork , she plunged it wildly into the ground , tossing sods and plants into the air in a frenzy of destruction . The loose earth fell on her hair , on her face , down which tears werep 35running . She was aware that she cut a grotesque and even repulsive figure , that her husband was shocked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasping sobs gave her pleasure , for she saw that this was the only punishment she had left for him , that the witchlike aspect of her form and the visible decay of her spirit would constitute , in the end , her revenge . She continued to lay about her with the spading fork , though the original fury had already passed off , until his solid , uneasy figure had disappeared from view , until his last words no longer sounded in her ears . It was late in August when he came into the living room with a heterogeneous bouquet in which she recognizedsome of the stubborner flowers of her garden , cosmos and cornflowers and a few blackish red miniature zinnias . Mixed in with these were some weeds , pinkish sprays of bouncing Bet and the greenish-white clusters of Queen Anne 's lace . There was no doubt of it , he had been visiting her garden , and this was not the first time . Toward the end of June she had heard him outside the window , swearing , as he tied up rambler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying , " Ca n't we have these for dinner ? " The berries were soft and broken  --  he had been too late in the harvest . She lay now on the sofa , reading a detective story , watching him as hep 36brought in a vase too tall for his bouquet and crammed the flowers into it . She felt no impulse to correct him ; his clumsiness , in fact , pleased her , the ugliness of the bouquet pleased her , just as the stain on the coffee table had pleased her , the spot on her maid 's uniform at lunch . She basked , as she had been doing all summer , in a sly private satisfaction . She was broken but she was also irreplaceable , and her continued physical existence must be , she thought , an unending reminder to him of everything he had lost . She was enjoying in real life the delight that is generally experienced only in daydreams , the sense of when I am dead , how they will mourn for me , how valuable I shall become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see her own case now with the detachment of a historian . Between them , he and she had killed off the part of her that had always excited his anxiety and irritation , the part of her which regarded nothing as final , which was continually planning , contriving , hoping , which lived in the future and slept , like a fireman , fully dressed for an emergency . It was this part of her which had dreamed of flight and deliverance , but it was also this part which had created for itself the small mirages of duty and pleasure which had held her to him for five years . These were not , as she had thought , antitheticalselves , but the same thing , the creative , con-p 37structive principle which , in its restless anticipation of change , built structures of semi-permanency  --  a series of overnight cabins that in their extension formed , not precisely a city , but at least a road , a via vitae . It was this part of her which had incurred his jealousy , for it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passion in private enterprises ; yet it was this part of her he now wished back , for he saw that this had been the nerve , and he now longed for a recurrenceof the very symptoms whose presence , three months ago , he had detested . Now , by a hundred spells , he was attempting to bring about a resurrection . He appealed to her housekeeping instinct , to her esthetic sense , to her vanity , to her pity ; his very clumsiness was an appeal for help , and it was not that she did not hear these appeals ; she heard , but , as in a dream , she was incapable of action . What it was all leading up to she understood plainly : a moment ought to come when she would rise miraculously from the sofa , sweep the absurd bouquet from his hands , shake it lightly into form , call for a new bowl , and enshrine the product on the mantelpiece , while he stood by , awkward and grateful , as at a religious ceremony , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and watch , with lowered eyelids , pretending to take no notice , enjoying her poor-man 's pie of irony and contempt. p 38For the pleasure she took in her untended house , in her careless and unsupervised maid , in her neglected garden ( which , however , she had never , since June , seen ) was purely negative in character , a compensation for disability . The discomfort inflicted on her husband by the loss of her imaginative faculty could never atone to her for the joy she had once had in the exercise of it . Lying on the sofa , looking about at the dusty bare room , she would feel excruciating stabs of remorse , like the pains in an amputated limb . She would get up and start at some task , but before the candlesticks were half polished , her interest would have died and she would leave them in the sink for her maid to finish . It could not , it seemed to her , go on much longer , and she prayed for him to abandon her . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterly out of the question . ) On him her life now depended ; where renunciation , the withdrawalof love , had blackened the loved objects as frost blackens the flowers in an autumn garden , he alone had survived , evergreen , sturdily perennial , in the season of death . Disliking him as she did , she had never bothered to renounce him , and now her eyes would come to rest on him with a kind of relief  --  the familiar detested object in surroundings grown strange and terrible . Her glance held in it also an element of calculation : how long , she asked herself , will he be able to stand me ? Her ownp 39endurance had become infinite , for she no longer lived in time , but he , being real , being alive , might reach in measurable stages the threshold of domestic suffering . He set the vase down on the table , took his handkerchief , and dusted the surface in a rather bustling way , like a woman who rattles dishes in the kitchen to awaken a sleeper whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call . He cleared his throat . " You have some beautiful flowers out back . " She sat up at last to look at him directly , but made no reply . " You ought to go out and see them . " She watched him hesitate and then think better of what was in his mind to say . He is afraid of me , she thought , with a touch of pity . " We ought to have some more of them in the house , " he continued , enthusiastically . " You have got all sorts of things back there . Even your weeds are wonderful , " and he went rattling on nervously , describing the scene in the fields , suggesting improvements  --  a professional tree surgeon to come for the old apple trees , a wattled fence along the lane , plans she had once proposed and he rejected . She was only half listening ; the very idea of these improvements now seemed to her preposterous ; one might as well paint a mural in a condemned house . Seeing that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tack . He came up to her and took her hand . " I miss the way this room used to look , " he said in a voice that was quite new with him , wistful and childlike in its directness . " Those yellow things you used to have on the coffee table . " For a moment now , she saw it all through his eyes , saw a vision which was less precise and accurate than hers , a rather smeary vision in which the pale , clear , lemon yellow he was thinking of ( African marigold , carnation-flowered , yellow supreme ) was likely to be confused with the orange of French marigold or of cosmos orange flare , a vision in which energy and whopping good intentions counted for more than anything else and the bigger a flower the better  --  but nevertheless a vision , an ideal of beauty , of love and the lavish hand ; and the sense of his loss , his large , vague loss , overwhelmed and engulfedher own . She pressed his hand lightly , murmuring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers drop . He regained her hand , however , and squeezed it . She felt , as once before in the fields , that he was on the verge of some fine avowal . She herself , only now , had made the great leap from pity to sympathy ; she grieved for his predicament , of which she herself was the determining factor ; could he likewise grieve for hers , whose existence he had never acknowledged , weep with her at last because she could not leave him , because the courage , the more attractivep 41alternative , whatever it was that might separate them , was lacking ? " I 've always loved your flowers , " he said , his voice blurred and high with emotion . " You know that . " As her ears admitted this lie , this tearful , sentimental , brazen lie , her whole nature rose weakly in rebellion . How dare you , her heart muttered , how dare you say it ? Nothing could have been  --  and at such a moment !  --  more dishonest ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controverted him utterly . But the heartfelt insincerity of these words went beyond contradiction , beyond hypocrisy , into regions of spiritual obstinacyand opacity impenetrable to reason , where reason , in fact , and conscience had been cruelly blinded by the will , the will which demanded that everything should be always all right , which had , as it were , legislated the bouquet on the mantelpiece by a kind of brutal denial of color , of tonal values , of the harmony of textures , and which was now enforcing its myth of a harmonious marriage , of tastes and occupations shared , by dictatorial fiat . And yet there had been the tears in the voice . . . . What the tears meant , she perceived , was that he did love the flowers , now that she had not got them , now that they were no longer dangerous ; they had passed , for him and for her , out of experience into memory , and here inp 42this twilight world he could possess them  --  and her  --  with a terrible blind rapacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he had got her where he wanted her ; she had been translated , bodily , into that realm of shadows where the will was all-powerful , the city of the dead . She herself was no more to him now than an oak leaf pressed in a schoolbook , a tendril of blond hair , a garter kept in a drawer . But this was , for him , everything : it was love and idolatry . The lie was a necessity to him , a cardinal article of faith . To protest was useless . He could not be shaken in his conviction , but only be annoyed , confused , thrown off . And in a final thrust of rejection , she yielded , conceding him everything  --  flowers , facts , truth . Let him put them into his authorized version ; she had failed them , and would do so again and again . With him , they would see service . She tightened her clasp on his hand . " Yes , " she said mistily , " I know . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have thought. p 43HIs GREAT QUALIFICATION was that nobody liked himvery much . That is , nobody liked him enough to make a point of him . Consequently , among the married couples he knew , he was universally popular . Since nobody cherished him , swore by him , quoted his jokes or his political prophecies , nobody else felt obliged to diminish him ; on the contrary , the husbands or wives of his friends were always discovering in him virtues theirp 44partners had never noticed , and a husband who was notorious for detesting the whole imposing suite of his wife 's acquaintance would make an enthusiasm of the obscure Francis Cleary , whom up to that time the wife had seldom thought about . In the long war of marriage , in the battle of the friends , Francis Cleary was an open city . Undefended , he remained immune , as though an inconspicuous white flag fluttered in his sharkskin lapel . The very mention of his name brought a certain kind of domestic argument to a dead stop . ( " You do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends . " " No , you do n't , you hate them . " " That 's not true , " and  --  triumphantly  --  " I like Francis Cleary . " ) A symbol of tolerance , of the spirit of compromise , he came into his own whenever one of his friends married . A man who in his single state had lunched with Francis Cleary once or twice a year would discover to his astonishment , after two or three years of marriage , that Francis Cleary was now his closest friend : he was invited regularly for weekends , for dinner , for cocktail parties ; he made the invariable fourth at bridge or tennis . Though he might never have been asked to the wedding ceremony ( and in fact it was more usual for the wife to have him introduced to her quite by chance a few months later , in a restaurant , and to experience a kind of Aristotelianrecognition  --  " Why has n't Jack ever spoken ofp 45you ? You must come to dinner next Thursday " ) , his azalea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital when the baby was born . If it was the wife who had originally been Francis Cleary 's friend , the graph of intimacy would follow the same curve . A mild admirer who had always figured in the background of her life , imperceptibly he would have slid to the very center of the composition : he came to stay for two weeks in the summer , played chess with her husband , and took her to dinner when she was alone in town . He had become " your friend Francis Cleary , " a walking advertisement of her husband 's good nature . " How can you say I am jealous ? " he would ask . " You had lunch with Francis Cleary only last week . " Left by herself with this old friend , she would  --  as she had always done  --  get bored , play the phonograph , make excuses to go to the kitchen to see how the maid was getting along with the hollandaise . Yet at her husband 's suggestion she would invite him again and again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that marriage had not really changed her , that she was still free to see her own friends , that her husband was a generous , fair-minded man who could not , naturally , be expected to share every one of her tastes . Moreover , it was so easy to have Francis Cleary . When her real friends came , something unpleasant usually happened  --  an argument , p 46an ill-considered reference to the past  --  or if nothing actually happened , she suffered in the expectation of its happening , so that when they finally left she echoed her husband 's " Thank God , that 's over ! " in the silence of her heart . A few awkward evenings , a weekend would serve , in most cases , to convince her that the love she felt for her friends was a positive obstacle to her happiness ; and she would renounce it , though perhaps only provisionally ( telling herself that surely , later on , in precisely the right circumstances Jim would come to see these people as she did  --  just as she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim would come to like string beans , if she served them to him in a moment of intimacy and with precisely the right sauce ) . Meanwhile , however , it was certainly better to have Francis Cleary , who was after all a close friend of her real friends ( had she not met him through them ? ) , and as the years passed the distinction between her " real " friends and Francis Cleary would blur in her mind and she would imagine that he had always been one of her dearest associates . His social mobility derived from the fact that he was capable of being used by other people as a symbol , and a symbol not only of an idea ( e.g. , tolerance ) but of an actual person or persons . Thus a husband , drawing up a guest list for an evening party , might remark to hisp 47wife , " How about having the Caldwells ? " ( or the Muellersor the Kaplans ) . " Oh my God , " his wife would shriek , " do we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " They 're awful , and besides they wo n't know anybody . " " They 're old friends of mine . I owe them something . " " Have them when I 'm away then  --  you know they ca n't stand me . " " Do n't be silly . They 'd be crazy about you if you 'd give them half a chance . " In desperation , the wife would cast about her . She saw her party , her charming , harmonious , mildly diversified party , heading straight for shipwreck on the rock of her husband 's stubbornness . Then all at once an inspiration would seize her . " Look , " she would say , in a more reasonabletone , " why do n't you ask Francis Cleary instead ? He 'd get along very well with these other people . And he 's your friend , just as much as Hugh Caldwell is . You 're wrong if you think it 's a matter of the Caldwells ' being your friends . It 's just that they would n't fit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as clearly as she , telling himself that if he insisted on the Caldwells his wife might treat them with impossible rudeness , and that even if she did not , she would make her concession an excuse for filling the house for months to come with her intolerablefriends , that he might win the battle but lose the war , would reluctantly , grudgingly , consent . After all , Francis Cleary belonged to the circle of the detested Caldwells. p 48To have him would be to have their spirit if not their substance , and , to be perfectly honest  --  he would say to himself  --  was n't it the principle of the Caldwells rather than their persons that was the issue at stake ? Another hostess , on slightly better terms with the prospectivehost , or perhaps merely a better tactician , would begin differently . " Darling , " she would say , looking up from the memorandum pad on which already a few names had been neatly aligned . " I have an idea . Why do n't we ask Francis Cleary ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would accord oddly with the fact that they always did have Francis Cleary at their parties , but the husband , who had been fearing something much worse ( some old school friend or a marvelous singer she had met at a benefit ) , would in his relief not notice the anomaly . " All right , " he would say , grateful to her for her interest in this rather dull old business associate , and before he had time to change his mind , she would have telephoned Francis Cleary and secured his acceptance . Then , when the question of the Caldwells was raised , she would pout slightly . " Oh , " she would say , " do n't you think that makes too much of the same thing ? After all , we 're having Francis Cleary , and I do think it 's a mistake to have a bloc at a party . " " I do n't know . " " Oh , darling , you remember the time we had p 49all those Italians and they sat in the corner and talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , the outcome was the same . Francis Cleary would appear at the party , representing the absent , unassimilable Caldwells . He was their abstraction , their ghost . Unobtrusive , moderately well bred , he would come early and stay late . He made no particular social contribution , but the host , whenever he glanced in his direction , would feel a throb of solidarity with his own past , and at some point in the evening he and Francis Cleary would have a talk about the Caldwells and Francis would tell him all about Hugh Caldwell 's latest adventure . Not ordinarily a brilliant talker , in this particularfield Francis Cleary was unsurpassed . He was a masterof the second-hand anecdote , the vicarious exploit . Hugh Caldwell , who suffered dreadfully from asthma and had a distressing habit of choking and gasping in the middle of his sentences , never could have done himselfthe justice Francis did . In fact , Hugh Caldwell , tellinghis own stories , interposed an obstacle , a distraction  --  himself , the living , asthmatic flesh  --  between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage , and the radio the concert hall , so Francis Cleary in modern life tended to supplant his friend , Hugh Caldwell , and in supplanting him , he glorified him . He was the movie screen on which the aging actress , thanks top 50the magic of the camera and make-up man , appears young and radiant , purged of her wrinkles ; he was the radio over which one hears a symphony without seeing the sweat of the first violinist . And yet , like all canned entertainment , Francis Cleary produced , in the end , a melancholy effect . To listen to him too long was like going to the movies in the morning ; it engendered a sense of alienation and distance . Eventually , the host would move away , his desire to see Caldwellkilled , not quickened , by this ghostly reunion , as the appetite is killed by a snack before dinner , as the taste for van Gogh 's paintings was killed by the reproductionsof the " Sunflowers " and " L'Arlesienne " that used to symbolize cultural sympathies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the lesson of " L'Arlesienne " prevented hardly anyone from making the same mistake with Picasso 's " Lady in White , " so the lesson of Hugh Caldwell never prevented the host from allowingFrancis Cleary to substitute on some other occasion for another old friend who was distasteful to the hostess , and many parties would be composed exclusively of Francis Clearys , male and female , stand-ins , reasonable facsimiles , who could fraternize with each other under the Redon or the Rouault or the Renoir reproductions  --  ready with anecdote , quotation , and paraphrase , amiable and immune as seconds at a duel . Afterwards , the host p 51and hostess , reviewing the situation , would be unable to decide why it was that though everybody stayed late , got drunk , and ate all the sandwiches , nobody had had a particularly good time . And the failure of the party , far from causing bitterness or recrimination , would actually draw them together . Murmuring criticisms of their guests , they would pull up the blankets and embrace , convinced that they preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple to anybodyelse they knew . But what about Francis Cleary riding home in a taxi with his female equivalent ? Sex was not for him ; his given name disclosed this  --  it could be either masculine or feminine ; nobody ever called him Frank . He might be a bachelor or a spinster ; quite often , he was a couple , but a couple which functioned as an integer . If he had begun his Francis Cleary existence as a single man , it was unwise for him to marry , for a wife might define him too sharply , people might like her and then other people would dislike her ; before he knew it , through her , he might become the issue rather than the solution of a dispute . To say that sex was not for him does not mean that he did not sometimes have girls , or , in his female aspect , men ; he might even have been in love , but since nearly the whole area of his life was public and social , this one small reserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . His romantic activities , if he had any , were extracurricular . They did not interfere with his social function , and it is impossible to tell which was cause and which effect : was it the fact that he had very early in life fallen in love with the married lady that placed his weekends and his evenings and his vacations at the disposal of his friends , or had he recognizedfrom the very beginning that he was cast for the part of the professional friend and arranged his affairs accordingly , cultivating without real predilection sexual tastes so impossible that they must be forever gratified sub rosa , under assumed names , in Pullman cars , alleys , cheap hotel rooms , public parks ? How was anybody to know ? In some of his manifestations , it seemed quite plain that design was at the bottom of it , that love had been gladly foregone for the sound of the telephone bell . He would hint at a disastrous passion or a vice to each of his married friends when the intimacy reached a certainstage , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conversation produces a calling card , kit these confessions had a faint air of fraudulence or at least of frivolity : how could anyone take very seriously a passion or a morbid inclination which left its victim free every day from five until midnight and all day Sundays and holidays ? Nevertheless , his confessions were accepted , often with a kind of gratitude . They served to " explain " p 53him to new acquaintances , who might have thought him peculiar if they had not been assured that he kept a truly horrible vice in his closet . In other cases , there appeared to have been no calculation . He thought sporadically of marriage but kept looking for " the right person , " who was assumed to exist somewhere just beyond the social horizon , like a soul waiting to be born . Yet whenever a living being materializedwho wore the features of the right person , she was found to be already married or indifferent or tied to an aged mother or in some other way impossible . So the vigil continued , until time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased to yearn , ascribed his fate to a geographical accident ( everybody has his double and everybody has his complement , but not necessarily in New York or even in America ) , to an over-romantic temperament , or simply to the bad habit , contracted in adolescence and never overcome , of falling in love with married women , which made him regard every woman who lacked a husband as essentially incomplete . Putting love behind him , Francis Cleary would throw himself more actively than ever into the occupation of friendship , the life of visits , small gifts and favors exchanged , mild gossip , concern over illnesses , outings for the children , and would , quite often , experience a kind of late blooming which would inspire all his friends to hope p 54that he was at last on the verge of marriage , while in reality it was the abandonment of the idea of marriage that had permitted his nature , finally , to express itself . In this aspect  --  the aspect of innocence  --  Francis Cleary was almost lovable . Certainly he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , and those husbands and wives who had accepted him as the lesser evil grew to like him for himself . It is significant , nevertheless , that he was liked for goodness of heart , which does not provoke envy , rather than for talent , charm , or beauty , which do . And goodness of heart notwithstanding , it was still a chore to dine or take a walk with him alone , and if by chance in these tete-a-tetes a muted happiness was achieved , his companion could never quite get over it , referred to the occasion repeatedly in conversation ( " You know , I had quite a good time with Francis Cleary the other day " ) , as though a miracle had been witnessed and virtue been its own reward . Yet here perhaps there has been a confusion of identity . It is likely that the Francis Cleary we have just been speaking of , the good , bewildered , yearning Francis Cleary , was never the true Francis Cleary at all , but an uncle for whom the real one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good Francis Cleary , his friends were struck by a certain anachronism in his character ; they would say that he reminded them of their childhood , p 55of a maiden aunt who did the mending , or a bachelor great-uncle who gave them a gold piece every Christmas morning and left his watch to them in his will when he died . The true Francis Cleary had no such overtones . He was as much a product of the age as nylon or plywood , and he could be distinguished from the others , those uncles and aunts of his who lingered on in a later period , by the fact that one did not pity him . One could not mourn for Francis , because he did not mourn for himself . He cast no shadow behind him of thwarted ambition , unconsummateddesire , lost ideals . Indeed , one had only to set the word frustration beside him to see that the very conception of frustration was outmoded , hopelessly provincial  --  perhaps in the Middle West , in small towns , men still walked the streets restlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been otherwise , but in any advanced center of civilization , people , like sheets , came pre-shrunk ; life held neither surprises nor disappointments for them . And your true Francis Cleary was the perfect Sanforizedman , the ideal which others only approximated . He appeared to have no demands whatsoever  --  that was the beauty of him . Or rather , as in a correctly balanced equation , demands and possible satisfactions canceled out , so that the man himself , i.e. , the problem , vanished . When an apartment door shut behind him , it was as if he p 56had never been . Nobody discussed him in his absence , or if they did , it was only as a concession to convention . Once or twice a year , he had a small , official illness , and in his comfortable hotel apartment received flowers , books , and wine-flavored calf's-foot jelly from his friends . Like everything else about him , these illnesses had a symbolic character : they permitted his friends to bestow on him tokens of a concern they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown to think themselves monsters of insensibility  --  was it , after all , natural to have a close friend whom you never gave a thought to ? Francis , farseeing , provident , took care that such questions should not arise . He could no more afford to be a thorn in the conscience , the subject of an inward argument , than to be the occasion of verbal debate . The true friend might languish in furnished rooms with pneumonia and only the girl across the hall to help , or fight delirium tremens in Bellevue , but Francis ' sore throats were always well attended . In the same way , he would from time to time present his friends with some innocuous little problem ( should he go to Maine or New Hampshire during his vacation ? ) with the air of a man who asks for help in the most serious crisis of his life . His friends would loyally come through with advice and travel booklets , reminiscences of childhood summers , letters of introduction , and feel , when Francis set off at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that they had stood by him through thick and thin , that the demands of friendship had been handsomely satisfied . Once in a great while , when a friendship showed unmistakablesigns of limpness ( when a husband and wife seemed to be falling in love with each other again , or had reached the point of estrangement where each saw his own friends , or began to cultivate the acquaintance of another Francis Cleary , a competitor ) , Francis would go so far as to borrow money from the husband . These loans were of course mere temporary accommodations , and the warm glow of generosity felt by the husband almost alwaysserved to restore the circulation of the friendship . Still , during the short time he had the money ( he usually waited until the twenty-seventh to borrow and then paid it back promptly the first of the next month ) , Francis was always very nervous . Once or twice he thought he had seen fear in the husband 's eyes , fear that financial need would turn " that nice Francis Cleary , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Frank . " Was it possible , he believed the husband was asking himself , that he could have been deceived ? Had importunity , cleverly disguised , always lurked in this old , old acquaintance , and had it waited this long to strike ? The classic phrase of male disillusionment , " I thought you were different , " trembled visibly on his lips , and Francis saw himself slip-p 58ping . The moment , of course , passed . Francis repaid the money , and the husband , metaphorically wiping the sweat from his brow , wondered how he could have doubted him . Certainly Francis was different , had always been so . The friends who had been with him at school or at college , and who could remember him at all , were absolutely at one on this point . Even there , at the very beginning , importunity had been excluded from his nature . The desire to excel , to shine , to be closest , best friend , most liked , best dressed , funniest , had played no part with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be along , the unnoticed eye-witness . Wherever he had gone to school , whether it was Exeter or P. S. 12 , whether Yale or Iowa or Carnegie Tech , the Chicago Art Institute or Harvard Business , he was the man that nobody could think of a quotation for when the yearbook was being compiled ; and if you opened the yearbooktoday you would find the editors ' defeat commemoratedby a blank below his photograph . Yet he had not been disliked , for there had been in him none of the burninghunger , the watchfulness , the covert shame ( however carefully masked by studiousness , indifference to society , eccentricity , geological field trips , bird walks ) that brand the true outsider for the vengeance of those inside . Duringthe rushing period he had been neither too anxious nor too self-assured nor too indifferent , with the resultp 59that , in many cases , he was pledged to a slightly better fraternity than he might have expected to make ; and in the cases where he was overlooked in the general excitement , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later on , in the junior year instead of the sophomore . And the welcome given him , whether tardy or prompt , never failed to create a small commotion among the outsiders , who knew themselves , correctly , to be more brilliant , better looking , richer , better scholars , better athletes , better drinkers , or whatever was considered valuable , than he . Inevitably , they construed the pledging of Francis Cleary as a calculated affront to themselves . Then and thereafter , forever and ever , the choice of Francis Cleary was not an affirmation of something , but a negationof something else . Thus , in the family we were talking about , if Francis Cleary was for the husband a substitute for Hugh Caldwell , for the wife he was the flat denial of Hugh Caldwell . Mr. Caldwell , sitting in his lumpy armchair in the Village , might have been solacing a bitch who would not let her husbandsee his rowdy old friends . But when Francis Cleary , another of John Leighton 's friends of the same vintage , dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Leightons ' , Mr. Caldwell could no longer mistake herp 60meaning . It was he personally who was being excluded , and if he stared at Francis Cleary and asked himself , " What in the name of God has this guy got that I have n't ? " this was precisely the question Mrs. Leighton intended to leave with him . At this point the reader may ask what possible motive Mrs. Leighton could have had . What drove her to persecutea man whom she hardly knew , who could not , even if he had wished it , have done her the slightest injury ? The reply can best be put in the form of a further question . Let anyone to whom Mrs. Leighton 's behavior seems inexplicable , or at any rate odd , ask himself why he does not like his wife 's friends . Is it really  --  as he is always telling himself  --  that they are unattractive or that they bring out the worst in her , encourage her to spend too much money or to think about love affairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom he is ignorant , or that they borrow from her or take up too much of her time ? Is it even , to be franker , that he is jealous of them ? This explanation too is insufficient , for we can look around us and find husbands who will not allow their wives ' friends or relations in the house but who display an amazing cordiality toward their wives ' lovers , and we can find husbands who positively reject their wives ' affection , who treat it as a bore and a nuisance , who yet will use every means to deprive their wives ofp 61what , from any sensible point of view , ought to be an outlet , a diversionary channel for that affection  --  the societyof friends . Is not envious , rather , the word ? Will the dubious reader acknowledge that his wife and her friends possess in common some quality that is absent from his own nature ? It is this quality that attracted him to her in the first place , though by now he has probably succeeded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the wife who marries the young poet because he is so different from all the other men she knows will soon succeed in getting him to go into the advertising business , or at the very least set up such a neurosis in him that he can only write one poem a year . What passes for love in our competitive society is frequently envy : the phlegmatic husband who marries a vivacious wife is in the same positionas the businessman who buys up the stock of a rival corporation in order to kill it . The businessman may at the beginning delude himself with the idea that the rival company has certain patents which he very much wants to exploit , but it will shortly appear that these patents , once so heartily desired , are in competition with his own processes  --  theywill have to be scrapped . We can not , in the end , possess anything that is not ourselves . That vivacity , money , respectability , talent which we hoped to add to ourselves by marriage are , we discover to our surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 62can do with them but destroy them , deaden the vivacity , spend the money , tarnish the respectability , maim the talent ; and when we have finished this work of destructionwe may even get angry  --  the wife of the poet may upbraid him because he no longer writes poems , or the dull husband of the gay girl may reproach her for her woodenness in company . Yet now a distinction must be made . In some cases , it is our wife or our husband who is the direct object of our envy and our desire , and in these marriages the friends are mere accidental victims ; we have nothing against them personally ; if we hate them it is because we have seen them smiling with our wife . But there is another kind of marriage , where it is the partner who is the accidental victim : simply a hostage whom we have carried home from a raid on the enemy , that is , on the circle of the friends . We bear this person no actual illwill ; we may even pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger in some nicety of reprisal . He himself is not the object of revenge , he is merely the symbol of our hostility , usually for some group , class , caste , sex , or race . Such cases are generally marked by a crude and striking disparitybetween the husband and the wife ; observe the communistmarried to the banker 's daughter , the anti-Semite who marries the beautiful Jewess , the businessman who marries an actress and makes her quit the stage . Thesep 63marriages are exercises in metonymy : the part is taken for the whole , the symbol for the thing symbolized . One might think , in the case of the businessman and the actress , that he had taken leave of his senses  --  why marry an actress if not to sit in the front row at her first nights ?  --  if one did not know that his college life had been poisoned by his failure to make the Thespian Society , and that his secret vendetta against the stage had already expressed itself in certain Times Square real estate operations , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in an anonymous note addressed to the Commissioner of Licenses pointing out an indelicate passage in a currentBroadway hit . The communist who subjects the banker'sdaughter to the petty squalor of life on Thirteenth Street  --  the unmade studio couch , the tin of evaporated milk flanking the rank brass ash tray on the breakfast table , the piles of dusty pamphlets , the late meetings , the cheap whiskey without soda , the hair done over the washbasinwith wave-set bought from a cut-rate druggist  --  this man may be actually repelled by the conditions in which he obliges her to live ; but his home is a stage kept set for the call her horrified father will pay them . And the anti-Semite who marries a beautiful Jewess may imagine that he has been carried away by love , treat her with great kindness , and exempt Fier from the Jewish race by a kind of personal fiat , declaring over and over p 64again to himself and possibly to her that he married her in spite of her relations , her mother , her sister , her hooknoseduncles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( who actually does not seem very Jewish ) , and it is the yearly visit of his mother-in-law to which he looks forward with sadistic zest . Summer after summer , he may promise his wife that he will not use the word " kike " in the old lady 's hearing again , but somehow it always slides out , the old lady goes upstairs in tears , and the marriage has once again been consummated . This distinction must be noted for the sake of clarity , though to the friends and to the wives and the husbands it makes really very little difference whether they are disliked for themselves or for some more irrelevant reason . The child struck by a bomb is indifferent to the private motives of the bombardier . Thus , with the Leightoncouple , to return to our original question , Mrs. Leightonmay have detested Hugh Caldwell because he or someone like him had once run a crayon through her sketch at a night class at the Art Students League or because she was a stylist at Macy 's and he a practicing nudist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests . Or she may have found only one thing to disparage in Mr. Caldwell  --  his feeling of friendship for her husband . In either case , the result would be the same ; whether from inclination or merely to spite herp 65husband , Mrs. Leighton would see to it that Mr. Caldwell was not at home in her nice new house . There are people who , whatever their good intentions , can not renounce love , and there are people , a larger number , who can not renounce victory . Thus , to take the second category first , a woman like Mrs. Leighton is not playing the game when she pretends to have sacrificed something by having only Francis Clearys at her parties ; the jealousy and anger of the excluded Hugh Caldwell more than repay her for any superficial boredom she may have experienced during the evening . A still worse cheat is the anti-Semite who asks a Jewish Frances Cleary , a second cousin of his wife 's , time after time to his house so that he may later express the most cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all was the businessman already alluded to who married the actress and whose hatred of theatrical people stopped short of a young Francis Cleary , a radio actor with whom the wife had once played a season of summer stock . This man , whose name was Al , enacted for several months a pseudo-friendship with Francis . He invited him to lunch downtown , introduced him to radio magnates , listened to his morning broadcasts ; the wife , the former actress , was at first bewildered and touched by these attentions , which she conceived to be overtures of love , and she began to look forward to the time whenp 66the house would be filled with her real friends , the playwrights , directors , and legitimate actors whom she missed so much in the country . It was not until her husband began to talk continually of the superiority of the verse drama of the air to the box-like drama of the stage that she perceived the malignancy of his design . Her answer was direct and militant . She treated Francis exactly as if he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without the slightest provocation , she turned him out of the house . This shocking experience was crucial for the young actor Francis Cleary . It confirmed in him the sense , not yet quite solidified , of the perils of his position . For nearly two hours , as he paced the station platform , waiting for the train that would take him away from Fairfield County , away from important men who professed to admire NormanCorwin and were going to take him to lunch with the president of the Red Network , for this long-short intolerabletime , he felt himself identified with the lot of humanity , with the mothers-in-law , sisters , true friends , ex-lovers for whom life is a series of indignities , with all those who , having attached themselves , are in a position to be dislodged . His heart cried out against the false husband who had not raised a hand to save him ; it cried out and at length he hardened it . From this time on , Francis took the most energetic measures lest the taint ofp 67affection poison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified with either partner to a marriage passed as devotion to the family , especially in doubtful cases like the Leightons ' , where to avoid the slightest appearance of partisanship , he concentrated his attention on the children and was always playing games with them on the floor or taking them out to the zoo or to holiday marionette shows  --  to the point that many of his friends kept remarkingto each other that it was such a pity that Francis had never married because he was obviously mad about children . And though many of the children did not at all care for Francis and would even prefer sitting at a bar while their father drank with some dubious confederate to the most delightful outing Francis could offer them , others , more successfully educated by their parents , would take the name for the thing and being told that Francis adored them would docilely adore him back , to the limit , at any rate , of their capacities . But in either case , the mother , watching her child set out hand in hand with Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misgiving lest the child positively enjoy himself with Francis . Her own feelings about Francis assured her that there was no danger whatever that the child would get anything better than what he was used to at home . In most instances , these precautionary measures were sufficient to keep Francis his status as friend . He watched , p 68with professional amusement , the struggles of his younger counterparts to extricate themselves from the depths of a closer relation . He himself could never again be fooled when a husband or a wife , out of sheer malignance , would pretend to like him , seek out his company , complainthat he was not asked to dinner often enough , lunch with him frequently alone , strike up a correspondence with him , till the other member of the couple would go nearly mad with exasperation and feelings of injustice , asking himself ( if it were the husband ) a hundred times a day how Dorothea could tolerate that lumpish little bore when she had a tantrum in the bedroom every time one of his real friends , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Francis could foretell , almost to the hour , the date of the inevitable rupture , and if it had not been for professional competition he might have warned his young namesake not to go to the Leightons on the night that John Leighton , for absolutely no reason , would break a highball glass over his head . He himself practiced such discretion in these matters that he occasionallyresorted to flight when there was no real necessity for it . The smallest compliment paid him by a husband or a wife would make him suspect a danger , and he would scurry away to safety before the friendship had got half started , while the couple , who had been countingon him to replace the people they liked in theirp 69social life and had no morbid designs at all , would ask themselves what they could have done to offend that nice Mr. Cleary . The night on the station platform had left him with its mark . Where formerly the desire to be loved , noticed , esteemed , had , if it ever feebly stirred in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being loved became a positive obsession with him . He saw annihilation stare at him in any half-affectionate glance . Though his whole activity was given over to the manipulation of the symbols of devotion  --  presents , visits , solicitous inquiries , games , walks in the country  --  still the validation of a single one of these tokens would suffice to ruin him , just as , it is presumed , the introduction of a single five-dollar gold piece into the channels of our currency would upsetour entire monetary system . The liking of a single human being would translate him into the realm of measuresand values , the realm of comparisons . Someone had valued him , and the whole question of his value was opened . From being a zero , the dead point at which reckoningbegins , he became a real number , if only the tiniest fraction , and thus entered the field of competition . Or to put it another way , he passed from being an x , an unknownand inestimable quantity which could be substitutedfor a known quantity ( Hugh ' Caldwell ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that isp 70he passed from algebra into arithmetic . He no longer representedHugh Caldwell , but existing now on the same plane was capable of being compared with him . However , his whole merit had consisted of the fact that nobody could possibly like him as much as Hugh Caldwell could be liked ; and indeed if anybody liked him one-half , onequarter , one-tenth as much , it was enough to finish him as the family friend . A husband , hearing his wife 's voice quicken as she answered Francis Cleary 's telephone call , would be startled into asking himself the impermissible question : Why do we see that fellow ? The light fervor of his wife 's tone jarred on his sense of what was fitting ; it breached some unspoken agreement  --  she was not playing fair . He felt as if he had been duped . From that moment on , he disliked Francis Cleary intensely , and his wife would have to fight to get him invited to a party , just as if he had been one of her own friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would soon find herself trying to see him when her husband was out of town or working late at the office ; she would meet him between engagements in the bars of quiet hotels . But this illicit atmosphere was deeply uncongenial to Francis . Her affection , her fidelity , could not begin to make up to him for the fact that he was no longer asked to her house . Indeed he hated her for that affection , which , as he saw it , was responsiblep 71for all the trouble . Like the husband , he experienced a sense of outrage ; he too had been betrayed by her . With her inordinate capacity for friendship , she had gulled them both . She , on her side , became aware that Francis was suffering from his exclusion . She imagined ( this particular wife was rather stupid ) that he missed his old friend , her husband ; and to save Francis pain she began to lie . " Jerry misses you terribly , " she would tell him , " but we see hardly anybody any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay home and read detective stories . . . . " Francis , of course , knew better , and eventually it would happen that he met them when they were diningout with a large party of friends , and the poor wife 's duplicity would be exposed . All her nudges and desperate , appealing glances went unanswered  --  Jerry would not inviteFrancis to sit down at their table . After that , Francis was always too busy to see her when she called . If anybodymentioned her name , he spoke of her with a rancor that was for him unusual , so that people assumed either that she had come between Francis and his old friend , her husband , or that she had tried to have an affair with Francis and failed . Of the husband he continued to speak in the highest terms , thus reinforcing both of these theories . And his admiration was not simulated . He respectedJerry for the contempt in which Jerry held him  --  it was an attitude they shared . As for the unfortunatep 72wife , she could never make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came to believe her husband when he told her , as he frequently did , that she had no talent for human relations . Between the Scylla of an Al and the Charybdis of a Jerry 's wife , Francis steers his uneasy course . Perhaps it is the vicissitudes of this life , the vigilance against the true and imaginary dangers , that are responsble for the change in Francis . Certainly it has been hard for him to be obliged , every year or so , to re-examine his premises . Francis had , it seemed to him , made a good bargain with the world . Yet whenever a Jerry 's wife took a fancy to him , he questioned his own shrewdness . If she likes me , he would ask himself , why would n't others , and if likes , why not loves , and does she really and how much ? It would be weeks , after such an experience , before Francis could silence these questions . Like a businessman , he feared that he had closed his deal with life too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And as the businessman can only set his mind at rest by assuring himself that the property he disposed of was really good riddance of a negligible asset , so Francis ' one recourse was to persuade himself once again that he had been perfectly correct in setting the zero , dejected yet triumphant , opposite his own name . But however successful as auditing , these midnightreckonings must have been painful , even to Francis ; p 73one night his anesthetized spirit must have awakened in rage and spite . Or perhaps nature does abhor a vacuum ; perhaps the wall of the sealed , sterile chamber that was Francis ' nature collapsed from atmospheric pressure , and in rushed all the unattached emotions  --  that is , hatred , envy , fear , which , unlike love , do not cling to a definite object  --  that float , gaseous , over man 's sphere . At any rate , Francis has been changing . Under our very eyes , he has been turning into everything that he , by definition , was not . If you have failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so much in the habit of not thinking about Francis that he could transform himself into a snake on your parlor floor without attracting your attention . Your indifference has been a cloak of invisibility behind which he has been preparing for you some rather startling surprises . But now that your memory has been jogged on the point , you will recall that his manners , while never highly polished , were once more acceptable than they are today . There was a time , for example , when he left your cocktail parties promptly at seven-thirty , taking with him one of the more burdensome women guests for a table -- d'hote dinner in the Village . But in the course of years his leavetakings have been steadily retarded ; soon your wife has been cooking scrambled eggs for him at nine o'clock ; and now you are lucky if at midnight or two or three youp 74do not have to make up a bed for him in the spare room or , at the very best , take him home in a taxi and open his door for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disputing , quoting poetry , playing the piano , singing ; today the fascinating people have always somewhere else to go , and every party boils down to Francis Cleary ; you do not question this , possibly , but accept it as an analogyto life . Perhaps it is Francis ' growing addiction to drink ( he no longer waits for you to notice his empty glass but helps himself from the shaker or inquires boldly , " Did someone say something about another drink ? " ) that keeps him late and is also responsible for the mounting truculenceof his conversation . In the old days Francis was alwaysprompt to shut off one of his anecdotes when his companion 's interest slightly wavered away from him ; indeed , much of his conversation seemed to be constructed around the interruption he awaited . Gradually , however , he has become more adhesive to his topics . He may be interrupted by the arrival of a newcomer , the host may excusehimself to fetch somebody 's coat , or the hostess may go in to look at the baby  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was saying , " he resumes , when the distraction has passed . Furthermore , his opinions , which he used to modulate to suit the conversation , never taking up a position without preparing a retreat from it , p 75have now become rigid and obtrusive . This is particularly true of him in his female aspect . Frances Cleary , once the indistinct listener , now arrives at a party with a single idea that haunts the conversation like a ghost . This idea is almost always regressive in character , the shade of a once-live controversy ( abstract vs. representational art , progressive vs. classical education ) , but the female Francestreats it as though she personally were its relict ; any change of subject she regards as irreverence to the dead . " Others may forget but I remember , " her aggrieved expressiondeclares . If the hostess is successful in deflecting her to some more personal topic , a single word overheard from across the room will be enough to send her train of ideas puffing out of the station once more . She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the menace of Mondrian ; momentarily silenced , she will instantly revive should one of the other guests be so carelessas to remark , " She 's as pretty as a picture . " " You can talk about pictures all you want , " Frances will begin . . . . In the male Francis Cleary this belligerency is more likely to take a physical form . More and more often nowadays , Francis breaks glasses , ash trays , lamps . His elbow catches the maid 's arm as she is serving the gravy , and the hostess 's dress must go to the cleaners . All during an evening , he may have been his old undemanding self , p 76but suddenly , at midnight , a sullenness will fall on him . " Oh , for Christ 's sake , " he will ejaculate when the talk goes over his head . Or he may grab someone else 's hat and stumble savagely out , knocking over a table on his way . As a couple , he does not drink too much . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the second drink . He arrives early , the two of him , and ensconces himself on the sofa ( the Clearys of all numbers and genders have an affinity for the sofa , which they occupy as a symbol of possession ) . From this point of vantage , he , or shall we say for convenience ' sake , they , overlook the proceedings with a kind of regal lumpishness . Though their position as friends of the family may be new and still insecure , they treat the very oldest and dearestmembers of the wife 's or the husband 's circle ( the college roommate , the former lover ) as candidates for their approval . They do not consider it necessary to talk in the ordinary way , but put sharp , inquisitorial questions to the people that are brought up to them ( " Would you mind telling me the significance of that yellow necktie ? " " Why do the characters in your novels have such a depressingsex life ? " ) , or else they merely sit , demanding to be entertained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last guest has gone , and present a report of their findingsp 77to the host and hostess . Nothing has escaped them ; they have noticed your former roommate 's stammer and your lover 's squint ; they have counted the highballs of the heavy drinker and recorded the tremor of his hand ; the woman you thought beautiful is , it turns out , bowlegged , and the lively Russian should have washed his hair . And they present these findings with absolute objectivity ; they do not judge but merely report . Though each human beingis , so to speak , a work of art , the Clearys are scientists , and take pride in disobeying the artist 's commands . If the artist places a highlight at what he considers a central point of his personality , a highlight that says , " Look here , " the Clearys instantly look elsewhere : the expressivenessof a man 's eyes will never blind them to the weaknessof his chin . And you and your wife , who have hithertoobeyed the laws of art and humanity and looked where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this clear , bleak view . Your friends whom you regarded as wholes are now assemblages of slightly damagedparts . You are plunged into despair , but you do not question the Clearys ' right to conduct this survey , for their observations are given a peculiar authority and force by the fact that they refer to the other guests  --  whom they have just met  --  by their first names . " John drinks terribly , does n't he ? " they say , and it is useloss for you to pretend that this particular evening was exceptionalp 78for your friend  --  that " John " asserts a familiarity with his habits that is greater , if anything , than your own . By the time they have finished their last glass ( " Just a little cool water from the tap , please " ) and you have seen them to the door you and your wife are utterly drained of energy and belief . There is not even a quarrel left between you , for they have exposed your friends and hers with perfect impartiality . Your world has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your sole escape from this intolerable situation is for one of you to blame the Clearys on the other . You can divide them up between you . If the husband , say , can be held responsible for Mr. and Mrs. Cleary ( " You were the one who insisted on having them " ) , the wife can take Francis as her charge . You can treat them , that is , as friends , and this will immediately result in the exclusion of both factions . But now a super Francis Cleary must be found , a zero raised to a higher power , a negation of a negation . The search may be long , you may wander down false trails , but finally one night at a cocktail party you will find him , the ineffable blank , and you and your wife will seize him and drag him home with you to eat sandwiches and talk excitedly like lovers , of why you have never met before . Your difficulties are over , your wife smiles at you again , and when the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your arm falls affectionatelyacross her shoulder . But alas the same process is about to begin again , and the stakes have been raised . Your new nonentity is larger and emptier than your original little friend ; naturally , he commands a higher price . Dozens of other couples are competing with you for this superb creation ; he does not hold himself cheap . You realize very quickly from the envious glances your colleagues and neighbors cast toward him whenever you display him at a public gathering that if you want to hold on to him you will have to pay through the nose . Gone are the potted plants , the Christmas cheeses , the toys for the children that were regularly issued by the old Francis Cleary . The super friend gives nothing ; he does not even try to make himselfagreeable ; he will not talk to old ladies or help with the dishes or go to the store for a loaf of bread . His company is all you will ever get of him , and the demands he makes on you will grow steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demeanor will tell you , you will have to give up your former friends , your work , your interests , your principles  --  the whole complex of idiosyncrasiesthat make up your nature  --  and your only reward for this terrible sacrifice is that your wife will have to make it too . Soon he will be bringing his own friends to your house , and these friends will be the other couplesp 80with whom you share him ( did you imagine that he could confine himself to you ? ) . Already he borrows your money , your books , and your whiskey . He will stop at nothing , for he has always hated you and now he knows that he has got you where he wants you  --  you can not live without him . Watching this monster as he sits at his ease on your sofa , your wife may look back with feelings of actual affection on your queer old friend , Hugh Caldwell ; but now it is too late . Hugh Caldwellspits at the mention of your wife 's name , and , quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyway , you ask yourself , are you really sure that you want to see Hugh Caldwell again , especially if it would mean that your wife , in return , could see one of her old friends ? No , you say to yourself , we can not have that ; there must be some compromise , some middle way  --  it is not necessary to go so far . Your mind beats on the door of the dilemma . Surely somewhere , you exclaim silently , somewhere in this great city , living quietly , perhaps , in a furnished room , there is a friend whom neither of us would have to feel so strongly about . . . . Some plain man or woman , some dowdy little couple of regular habits and indefinite tastes , some person utterly unobjectionable , unobtrusive , undefined . . . . With loving strokes , you complete the portrait of this ideal , and all the whilep 81there he sits , grinning at you , the lesser evil , but you do not recognize him . After all , you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give up anything for a little peace and quiet . You forget that it was in the name of peace and quiet that this despot was welcomed  --  just as the Jewish banker in the concentration camp forgets the donation he made to the Nazi party fund , back in 1931 , when his great fear was communism ; just as Benedetto Croce , antifascistphilosopher , forgot in Naples the days when he supported Mussolini in the Senate at Rome , because order was certainly preferable to anarchy and bolshevism was the real menace . You can not believe , you will not ever believe , that your desire for peace and quiet , i.e. , for the permanent stalemate , has logically resulted in the noisy oppressor on the sofa . On the contrary , his presence there seems to you a cruel and unaccountable accident . You are not happy with your wife but you do not want change . In a more romantic period you might have dreamed of voluptuous blondes , fast women and low haunts ; you might even have run off with the lady organistor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of peace and careful respectability . You do not ask adventure or the larger life . Though at one time , theoretically , you may have desired these things , you have perceived that adventure for one can readily be the 82excuse for adventure for all , and who knows but what your wife 's or your neighbor 's capacity for adventure might be greater than your own ? If all men were created equal , programs for achieving equality would not exist . The industrialist would welcome the people 's army into the gates of the factory , if he could be sure that nobody would be any better off than he . We do not want more than anyone else , though we may take more for fear of getting less . What we desire is absolute parity , and this can only be achieved by calculating in a downward direction , with zero as the ultimate , unattainable ideal . Our lives become a series of disarmament conferences : I will reduce my demands if you will reduce yours . With parity as our aim , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a nation will be allowed a navy which it has not the productive capacity to build , or a man may be granted freedoms which he has not the faculties to exercise , and gross inequalities will immediately result . So long as you and I can not accept the doctrine " From each according to his capacities , to each according to his needs , " the totalitarian state will supply the answer to the difficulties of democracy and Francis Cleary will be the ideal friend . At this very moment , you are planning to overthrow the incumbent Cleary , who happens to be staying with you for the weekend . In a loud voice he has demanded something to eat , though he finished lunch onlyp 83an hour ago . Your wife has rushed out to the kitchen to make him a chicken sandwich , and you sit watching him in uneasy silence . You are afraid to play the phonographbecause he does not like music ; you are afraid to initiate a topic of conversation because he resents any mention of persons he has not met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick up a newspaper lest he take it as a slight  --  and if you cross him he will pinch the baby . The fires of resistance are lit in your heart as the sandwichcomes in and he opens it with a blunt critical finger and asks for pickles and mayonnaise . Your pulse quickens in little throbs of solidarity with your unfortunate wife . You will make , you say to yourself , common cause with her and eject the tyrant . If she will do it for you , so much the better ; but there can be no question whatever about the heartiness of your support . The danger is , of course , that in the warm fraternity of the revolt , the coziness of plans and preparations , the intimacy of secret meetings in lonely houses at night , with a reliable farmer standing guard ( Qui passe ? ) , certain illusions of your wife 's may be revived . The whole question of friends may be opened again ; a period of anarchy may even follow in which all the ghosts of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate the old issues ; tempers will rise and you will have to fling out of the house late at nightp 84and look for a room in a hotel . In the interests of peace , you say to yourself , would it not be wiser to select in advancesome common friend and avoid the interregnum ? Somewhere , only recently did you not meet a couple . . . ? In vain , you try to recall their faces and their name . Memory is obstinate but you do not despair . The very dimness of your impression convinces you that you are on the right track . They are the ones . If you meet them again , you will know them at once and rush forward to meet them with a glad cry of recognition . There is only one difficulty . Supposing they are already engaged . . . ? Your only way out of this recurrent nightmare ( not counting the humane one , which is hardly worth mentioning ) is for you and your wife to take the logical next step , to become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should you shrink from it ? What have you to lose ? In what do you differ from the man on the sofa ? p 85WHEN THEY first met him , in the wagons-lits , he was not so nervous . Tall , straw-colored , standing smoking in the corridor , he looked like an English cigarette . Indeed , there was something about him so altogether parched and faded that he seemed to bear the same relation to a man that a Gold Flake bears to a normal cigarette . English , surely , said the young American lady . The young Americanman was not convinced . If English , then a bounder , p 86he said , adjusting his glasses to peer at the stranger with such impassioned curiosity that his eyes in their lightbrownframes seemed to rush dangerously forward , like strange green headlights on an old-fashioned car . As yet , he felt no unusual interest in the stranger who had just emerged from a compartment ; this curiosity was his ordinary state of being . It was so hard , the young lady complained , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never sure ; those dreadful striped suits that English gentlemen wear . . . and the Duke of Windsor talking in a cockney accent . Here on the Continent , continued the young man , it was even more confusing , with the upper classes trying to dress like English gentlemen and striking the inevitable false notes ; the dukes all looked like floorwalkers , but every man who looked like a floorwalker was unfortunatelynot a duke . Their conversation continued in an agreeable rattle-rattle . Its inspiration , the Bounder , was already half-dismissed . It was not quite clear to either of them whether they were trying to get into European society or whether this was simply a joke that they had between them . The young man had lunched with a viscountessin Paris and had admired her house and her houseboat , which was docked in the Seine . They had poked their heads into a great many courtyards in the Faubourg St. Germain , including the very grandiose one , p 87bristling with guards who instantly ejected them , that belonged to the Soviet Embassy . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid answer to their social curiosity : the bedroom of Marie Antoinette at the Petit Trianon had informed them that the French royal family were dwarfs , a secret already hinted at in Mme Pompadour'sbedroom at the Frick museum in New York ; in Milan , they would meet the Sforzas through the agency of their Castello ; at Stra , on the Brenta , they would get to know the Pisani . They had read Proust , and the decline of the great names in modern times was accepted by them as a fact ; the political speeches of the living Count Sforza suggested the table-talk of Mme Verdurin , gracingwith her bourgeois platitudes the board of an ancient house . Nevertheless , the sight of a rococo ceiling , a great swaying crystal chandelier , glimpsed at night through an open second-story window , would come to them like an invitationwhich is known to exist but which has been incomprehensiblylost in the mails ; a vague sadness descended , yet they did not feel like outsiders . Victors in a world war of unparalleled ferocity , heirs of imperialism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the dilapidated streets of Europe . They had not approved of the war and were pacifist and bohemian in their sympathies , but the exchange had made them feel rich , and they could not help showing it . Thep 88exchange had turned them into a prince and a princess , and , considering the small bills , the weekly financial anxieties that attended them at home , this was quite an accomplishment . There was no door , therefore , that , they believed , would not open to them should they present themselves fresh and crisp as two one-dollar bills . These beliefs , these dreams , were , so far , no more to them than a story children tell each other . The young man , in fact , had found his small role as war-profiteer so distasteful and also so frightening that he had refused for a whole week to go to his money-changer and had cashed his checks at the regular rate at the bank . For the most part , their practical , moral life was lived , guidebook in hand , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank  --  they got few messages at their hotel . Yet occasionally when they went in their best clothes to a fashionable bar , she wearing the flowers he had bought her ( ten cents in American money ) , they hoped in silent unison during the first cocktail for the **28;4628;TOOLONG would discover them in this dark continent . And now on the train that was carrying them into Italy , the European illusion quickened once more within them . They eyed every stranger with that suspension of disbelief which , to invert Wordsworth , makes its object poetical . The man at the next table had talked all through lunch to two low types with his mouth full , but the young manp 89remained steady in his conviction that the chewer was a certain English baronet traveling to his villa in Florence , and he had nearly persuaded the young lady to go up and ask him his name . He particularly valued the young lady today because , coming from the West , she entered readily into conversation with people she did not know . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ( " My dear , " said the young lady , " a couple looks so complete " ) , but they were not inclined to separate  --  the best jockey in a horse race scorns to take a lighter weight . Unfortunately , their car , except for the Bounder at the other end , offered very little scope to his imaginative talent or her loquacity . But , as they were saying , Continental standards were mysteriously different ; at the frontier at Domodossola a crowd gathered on the rainy platform in front of their car . Clearly there was some object of attraction here , and , dismissing the idea that it was herself , the young lady moved to the window . Next to her , a short , heavy , ugly man with steel-rimmed spectacles was passing some money to a person on the platform , who immediately hurried away . Other men came up and spoke in undertones through the window to the man beside her . In all of this there was something that struck the young lady as strange  --  so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposeful , the more businesslike without its naturalp 90accompaniment of sound . Her clear , **29;4658;TOOLONG intruded resolutely on this quarantine . " Qu'est-ce que se passe ? " she demanded . " Rien , " said her neighbor abruptly , glancing at her and away with a single , swiveling movement of the spectacled eyes . " C'est des amis qui recontrent des amis . " Rebuffed , she turned back to the young man . " Black market , " she said . " They are changing money . " He nodded , but seeing her thoughts travel capably to the dollar bills pinned to her underslip , he touched her with a cautioning hand . The dead , noncommittalface beside her , the briefcase , the noiseless , nondescript young men on the platform , the single laugh that had rung out in the Bounder 's end of the car when the young lady had put her question , all bade him beware : this black market was not for tourists . The man who had hurried away came back with a dirty roll of bills which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " remarkedthe young lady sardonically , but the man beside her gave no sign of having heard ; he continued to gaze immovably at the thin young men before him , as though the transaction had not yet been digested . At this moment , suddenly , a hubbub of singing , of agitatedvoices shouting slogans was heard . A kind of frenzy of noise , which had an unruly , an unmistakably seditious character , moved toward the train from somewhere outside the shed . The train gave a loud puff . " A revolution ! " p 91thought the young lady , clasping the young man 's hand with a pang of terror and excitement ; he , like everyone else in the car , had jumped to his feet . A strange processioncame into sight , bright and bedraggled in the rain  --  an old woman in a white dress and flowered hat waving a large red flag , two or three followers with a homemade-looking bouquet , and finally a gray-bearded old man dressed in an ancient frock coat , carrying an open old-fashioned black umbrella and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's hops was fully two yards high ; his thin legs in the black trousers were jackknifedneatly under him ; the umbrella maintained a perfect perpendicular ; only his beard flew forward and his coat-tails back ; at the summit of each hop , he shouted joyously , " Togliatti ! " The demonstration was coming toward the car , where alarm had given way to amazement ; Steel Glasses alone was undisturbed by the appearance of these relics of political idealism ; his eyes rested on them without expression . Just as they gained the protection of the shed , the train , unfortunately , began to move . The followers , lacking the old man 's gymnastic precision , were haphazard with the bouquet ; it missed the window , which had been opened for the lira-changing , and fell back into the silent crowd . The train picked up speed . In the compartment , the young man was rolling on the seat with laughter ; he was always the victim of his emo-p 92tions , which  --  even the pleasurable ones  --  seemed to overrunhim like the troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had a look of intensest suffering , and the young lady clucked sympathetically as he gasped out , " The Possessed , The Possessed . " To the newcomer in the compartment , however , the young man 's condition appearedstrange . " What is the matter with him ? " the young man , deep in the depths of his joy , heard an odd , accented little voice asking ; then the young lady 's voice was explaining , " Dostoevski . . . a small political center . . a provincial Russian town . " " But no , " said the other voice , " it is Togliatti , the leader of Italian Communists who is in the next compartment . He is coming from the Peace Conference where he talks to Molotov . " The words , Communist , Molotov , Peace Conference , bored the young man so much that he came to his senses instantly , sat up , wiped his glasses , and perceived that it was the Bounder who was in the compartment , and to whom the young lady was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the platform had reminded him of something in a book . " But no , " protested the Bounder , who was still convinced that the young lady had not understoodhim . He appeared to come to some sort of decision and ran out into the corridor , returning with a Milanese newspaper folded to show an item in which the words , Togliatti , Parigi , Pace , and Molotov all indubitably fig-p 93ured . The young lady , weary of explanation , allowed a bright smile as of final comprehension to pass over her features and handed the paper to the young man , who could not read Italian either ; in such acts of submission their conversations with Europeans always ended . They had got used to it , but they sometimes felt that they had stepped at Le Havre into some vast cathedral where a series of intrusive custodians stood between them and the frescoes relating with tireless patience the story of the Nativity . Europeans , indeed , seemed to them often a race of custodians , didactic automatons who answered , like fortune-telling machines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which no one would conceivablyask . True to this character , the Bounder , now , had plainly taken a shine to the young lady , who was permitting him to tell her facts about the Italian political situation which she had previously read in a newspaper . That her position on Togliatti was identical with his own , he assumed as axiomatic , and her dissident murmurs of correction he treated as a kind of linguistic static . Her seat on the wagons-lits spoke louder to him than words ; she could never persuade him that she hated Togliatti from the left , any more than she could convince a guide in Paris of her indifference to Puvis de Chavannes . Her attention he took for assent , and only the young man troubled him , as hep 94had troubled many guides in many palaces and museums by lingering behind in some room he fancied ; an occasionalhalf-smothered burst of laughter indicated to the two talkers that he was still in the Dostoevski attic . But the glances of tender understanding that the young lady kept rather pointedly turning toward her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the visitor neatly drew up his trousers and sat down . They judged him to be a man about forty-two years old . In America he might have passed for younger ; he had kept his hair , light-brown and slightly oiled , with a ripple at the brow and a half-ripple at the back ; his figure , moreover , was slim  --  it had not taken on that architectural form , those transepts , bows , and barrelvaulting , that with Americans demonstrate ( how quickly often ! ) that the man is no longer a boy but an Institution . Like the young lady 's hairdresser , like the gay little grocer on Third Avenue , he had retained in middle age something for which there is no English word , something tres mignon , something gentil , something joli garcon . It lay in a quickness and lightness of movement , in slim ankles , small feet , thin , agile wrists , in a certain demure swoop of lowering eyelids , in the play of lashes , and the butterfly flutter of the airy white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a politeness so eager as to seem freshly learned and in a childlike vanity , ap 95covert sense of performance , in which one could trace the swing of the censer and the half-military , half-theatricalswish of the altar-boy 's skirts . But if this sprightliness of demeanor and of dress gave the visitor an appearance of youthfulness , it also gave him , by its very exaggeration , a morbid appearance of age . Those quick , small smiles , those turns of the eye , and expressive raisings of the eyebrow had left a thousandtiny wrinkles on his dust-colored face ; his slimness too had something cadaverous in it  --  chicken-breasted he appeared in his tan silk gabardine suit . And , oddly enough , this look of premature senility was not masculine but feminine . Though no more barbered and perfumed than the next Italian man , he evoked the black mass of the dressing-table and the hand-mirror ; he reminded them of that horror so often met in Paris , city of beauty , the well-preserved woman in her fifties . At the same time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conquests . It was simply , perhaps , that the preservation of youth had been his main occupation ; age was the specter he had dealt with too closely ; like those middleagedwomen he had become its intimate through long animosity . Yet just as they had decided that he was a man somehowwithout a profession ( they had come to think in unison and needed the spoken word only for a check ) , hep 96steered himself out of a small whirlpool of ruffled political feelings and announced that he was in the silk business . He was returning from London , and had spent a week in Paris , where he had been short of francs and had suffered a serious embarrassment when taking a lady out to lunch . The lady , it appeared , was the wife of the Egyptian delegateto the Peace Conference , whom he had met -- also -- -on the wagons-lits . There was a great deal more of this , all either very simple or very complicated , they were unable to say which , for they could not make out whether he was telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a folk tale , the second story repeated the pattern of the first but had a variant ending . His English was very odd ; it had a speed and a precision of enunciation that combined with a vagueness of grammar so as to make the two Americans feel that they were listening to a foreign language , a few words of which they could recognize . In the same way , his anecdotes had a wealth and circumstantialityof detail and an overall absence of form , or at least so the young lady , who was the only one who was listening , reported later to the young man . The young man , who was tone-deaf , found the visitor 's conversation reminiscent of many concerts he had been taken to , where he could only distinguish the opening bars of any given work ; for him , Mr. Sciarappa 's stories were all in their beginnings , and he would interrupt quite often with p 97a reply square in the middle , just as , quite often , he used to break in with wild applause when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonata . But at the mention of the silk business , the young man 's eyes had once more burned a terrifying green . With his Ahmed imagination , he was at the same time extremely practical . Hostile to Marxist theory , he was marxist in personal matters , having no interest in people 's opinions , or even , perhaps , in their emotions ( the superstructure ) , but passionately , madly curious as to what people did and how they made their money ( the base ) . He did not intend that Mr. Sciarappa ( he had presented his card ) should linger forever in Paris adding up the lunch bill of the Egyptian delegate 's wife . Having lain couchant for the ten minutes that human politeness required , he sprang into the conversation with a question : did the signor have an interest in the silk mills at Como ? And now the visitor betrayed the first signs of nervousness . The question had suggested knowledge that was at least second-hand . The answer remained obscure . Mr. Sciarappa did not preciselyown a factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two friends , who were not lacking in common humanity , precipitately turned the subject to the beauty of Italian silks , the superiority of Italian tailoring to French or even English tailoring , the chic of Italian men . The moment passed , and a little later , under the pre- p 98tense of needing her help as a translator , Mr. Sciarappa showed the young lady a cablegram dated London which seemed to be a provisional order for a certain quantity of something , but the garbled character of the English suggested that the cable had been composed  --  in London  --  by Mr. Sciarappa himself . Nevertheless , the Americans accepted the cablegram as a proof of their visitor 's bona fides , though actually it proved no more than that he was in business , that is , that he existed in the Italy of the post-war world . The troubled moment , in fact , had its importance for them only in retrospect . A seismographic recording of conditions in the compartment would have shown only the faintest tremor . The desire to believe the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reserved for friends . The young lady in particular , beinggregarious , took the kindest view of everyone ; she was under the impression that she was the only person in the world who told lies . The young man today fell in with her gullibility , with her " normal " interpretations of life , because he saw that they were heading for friendship with Mr. Sciarappa and felt as yet no positive objections to the idea . They were alone in Italy ; a guide would be useful . Moreover , Mr. Sciarappa had announced that he was going on to Rome , where he lived with his parents , at midnight . Already he had invited them to join him for ap 99drink in Milan in the famous Galleria ; the worst they could expect was a dinner a trois . Therefore , he acted , temporarily , on the young lady 's persuasion that their visitor was an ordinary member of the upper middle classes in vaguely comfortable circumstances , in other words , that he was an abstraction ; in the same way , certainother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conveyed him , somewhat more critical and cautious , into this compartment with her on a romanticjourney into Italy . But , just as it had come as a surprise to him that love should go on from step to step , that it should move from city to country and cross an ocean and part of a continent , so in Milan it was with a vague astonishment that he beheld Mr. Sciarappa remove his baggage from the taxi in front of their hotel and hurry inside ahead of him to inquire for a room . For the next three days , the trio could be seen any evening promenading , arm in arm , down the long arcade of the Galleria , past the crowded little tables with the pink , and the peach , and the lime , and the orange colored tablecloths , walking with the air of distinguished inseparables , the two tall men and the tallish young lady with a large black hat . Or at noon they could be found there , perspiring and not so distinguished , sipping Americanos , Mr. Sciarappa 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which Mr. Sciarappap 100considered the cheapest . At night , they appeared at Giannino'sor Crispi 's ( not so expensive as Biffi 's but better food , said Mr. Sciarappa ) , restaurants where Mr. Sciarappamade himself at home , sending back the wine which the Americans had ordered and getting in its place some thinner and sourer vintage of which he had special knowledge . The one solid trait the two friends could discover in Mr. Sciarappa 's character was a rooted abhorrence of the advertised first-rate , of best hotels , top restaurants , principal shopping streets , famous vineyards ; and , since for the first time in many years they saw themselves in a position to command these advantages , they found this trait of Mr. Sciarappa 's rather a cross . In American money , the difference between the best and the mediocre was trifling ; indeed even in Italian money , it was often nonexistent . They tried to convince Mr. Sciarappa of this , but their computations he took as an insult to himself and his defeated country . His lip would curl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had come out of a permanent-wavemachine . " Ah , you Americans , " he would say , " your streets are paved with dollars . " The two friends , after the first night , spent on bad beds in an airless room hung with soiled lace curtains , moved with a certain thump into the best hotel next door . They would not have stayed in any case , for the young man had a horror of the sordid , and the best hotel proved , p 101when you counted breakfast , to be cheaper than its second-rateneighbor . Nevertheless , in the circumstances , the move had a significant tone  --  they hoped to fray , if not to sever , their connection with Mr. Sciarappa , and perhaps also , to tell the truth , to insult him a little . The best hotel , half-requisitioned by the Allied armies , smiled on them with brass and silver insignia , freshly washed summer khaki and blond , straight , water-combed American hair ; when Mr. Sciarappa came for cocktails in the same gabardinesuit , he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mental institution . The young lady , who was the specialist in sentiments , felt toward him sorrow , shame , triumph . They could not make out what he wanted of them . Whatever business had , on the train , been hurrying him on to Rome had presumably lost its urgency . He never mentioned it again ; indeed , the three spoke very little together , and it was this that gave them that linked and wedded look . During the day he disappeared , except for the luncheon aperitif . He went to Como , to Genoa , and , once , in the Galleria , they saw him with an unshaven , white-haired , morose-looking man whom he introducedas his brother-in-law . In restaurants , he was foreverjumping up from the table with a gay little wave of the hand to greet a party that was in the act of vanishinginto the dark outdoors . Though he was a man whop 102twitched with sociability , whose conversation was a veritablememo pad of given names , connections , ties , appointments , he seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insolent style of an old customer . The brother-in-law , who plainly disliked him , and they themselves , whom he hated , were his only friends . The most remarkable symptom of this hatred , which ate into the conversation leaving acid holes of boredom , which kept him glancing at other tables as though in hope of succor or release , was a tone of unshakable , impolite disbelief . " Ah , I am not such a fool , " his pretty face would almost angrily indicate if they told him that they had spent their morning in the castle-fort of the Sforzas , where beneath the ramparts bombed by the Liberators , a troupe of Italian players with spotlights lent by the American army was preparing to do an American pacifist play . Every statement volunteered by the two friends broke on the edge of Mr. Sciarappa 's contempt like the very thinnestalibi ; parks and the public buildings they described to him became as transparent as falsehoods  --  anyone of any experience knew there were no such places in Milan . When they praised the wicked-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Sciarappaand his disaffected brother-in-law , who was supposedto speak no English , exchanged , for the first time , a fraternal , sidewise look : a masterpiece , indeed , their in-p 103credulous eyebrows ejaculated  --  they had heard that story before . That Mr. Sciarappa should question their professions of enthusiasm was perhaps natural . His own acquaintance with Italy 's artistic treasures seemed distant ; they had had the reputation with him of being much admired by English and American tourists ; the English and Americanair-forces , however , had quoted them , as he saw , at a somewhat lower rate . Moreover , it was as if the devaluationof the currency had , for Mr. Sciarappa 's consistent thought , implicated everything Italian ; cathedrals , pictures , women had dropped with the lira . He could not imagine that anyone could take these things at their Baedeker valuation , any more than he could imagine that anyone in his right mind would change dollars into lira at the official rate . The two friends soon learned that to praise any Italian product , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was an insult to Mr. Sciarappa 's intelligence . They would be silent  --  and eventually were  --  but the most egregious insult , the story that they had come to Italy as tourists , they could not wipe away . He felt himself to be the victim of an imposture , that was plain . But did he believe that they were rich pretending to be poor , or poor pretending to be rich ? They could not tell . On the whole , it seemed as if Mr. Sciarappa'ssuspicions , like everything else about him , had 104a certain flickering quality ; the light in him went on and off , as he touched one theory or another , cruising in his shaft like an elevator . And , as the young man said , you could not blame Mr. Sciarappa for wondering : was it in the character of a rich man or a poor that they stayed in the best hotel , which was slightly less expensive than an American auto-camp ? The obscurity of their financial position justified Mr. Sciarappa 's anger . Nevertheless , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stranger who was continually out of sorts because he could not make up his mind whether they were worth swindling . " We did not come to Italy to see Mr. Sciarappa , " they would say to each other every night as they rode up in the elevator , and would promise themselves to evade this time , without fail , the meeting he had fixed for the next day . Yet as noon came on the following morning , they would find that they were approaching the Galleria . He is waiting , they would say to each other , and without discussion they would hurry on toward the cafe with the orange tablecloths , where they were late but never quite late enough to miss Mr. Sciarappa . He was never glad to see them . He rose to acknowledge them with a kind of bravura laziness of his tall " English " figure , one shoulder lifted in a shrug of ennui or resignation . He kissed the young lady 's hand and said to the p| 105young man perfunctorily , and sometimes with a positive yawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One of his odd little tricks was to pretend that they were not together . The young man 's frequent absences of mind he treated literally , when it suited him , as if they were absences of body , and once he carried this so far as to run his fingers up and down the young lady 's bare arm as the three of them rode in a taxi , inquiring as he did so , in the most civil tone imaginable , whether she found her friend satisfactory . His conversation was directed principally to the young lady , but for all that he had no real interest in her . It was the young man whom he watched , often in the mirror of her face , which never left her friend as he talked wildly , excitedly , extravagantly , with long wrists flung outward in intensity of gesture : did Mr. Sciarappa see beauty and strangeness in him or the eccentricity of money ? Or was he merely trying to determine which it was that she saw ? It was irresistible that they should try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had begun to call him , after fried crayfish-tails , his favorite dish ) out into the open . The name of a certain lady , middlingly but authenticallyrich , who was expecting to see them in Venice , began to figure allusively , alluringly , in their conversation . These pointers that they directed toward Polly Herkimer Grabbe had at first a merely educational pur- p 106pose . National pride forbade that they should allow Scampi to take them for rich Americans when a really good example of the genre existed only a day 's journey away . But their first references to the flower-bulb heiress , to her many husbands , her collection of garden statuary , her career as an impresario of modern architecture , failed , seemingly , to impress Scampi ; he raised his eyes briefly from the plate of Saltimbocca ( Jump-in-yourmouth ) that he was eating , and then returned to his meal . The language difficulties made it sometimes impossible to tell whether Mr. Sciarappa really heard what they said . They had remarked once , for example , in conversational desperation , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Byron : they were on their way from Lausanne , where he had composed " The Prisoner of Chillon " in a bedroom of the Hotel Angleterre , to Venice to visit his house on the Grand Canal . " Ah well , my dear , " said Mr. Sciarappa , " if he is an English lord , you do not have to worry ; his house will not be requisitioned , and you will have the use of his gondolier . " There had been no way the young man could find of preventing the young lady from supplying the poet 's dates , and now , it seemed , Scampi was under the impression that everyone they knew in Venice was dead . It required the largest brush-strokes to bring Miss Grabbe to life for him . By the third night , when the 107young man had finished a wholly invented account of Miss Grabbe 's going through the customs with a collection of obscene fountain statuary , Mr. Sciarappa showed interest and inquired how old Miss Grabbe was . The next evening , at cocktails , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next morning at seven . The two Americans , remembering that the flower-bulb heiress was , after all , their friend , felt appalled and slightly frightened at what they had done . They thought of dropping some note of warning into the letter of introduction which of course they would have to write . But then they reflected that if Miss Grabbe was richer than they , she was also proportionately shrewder : glass bricks only could Mr. Sciarappa sell her for that submarine architectural salon she spoke of opening in the depths of the Grand Canal . Miss Grabbe 's intelligence was flighty ( she had once forgotten to include the furnace in a winter house that so hugged the idea of warmth that the bathtubs were done in buff ) , but her estimates were sharp ; no contractor or husband had ever padded a bill on her ; she always put on her glasses to add up a dinner check . Men , it was true , had injured her , and movements had left her flat , but these misadventures she had cheerfully added to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comedy when she perceived that the world wasp 108smiling ; she was always the second to laugh at a pratfallof her spirit . Mr. Sciarappa , at worst , could only be another banana-peel on the vaudeville stage of her history . It was possible , of course , that he might bore her , thought the two friends , reasoning from experience ; this alone she would not forgive them , yet Miss Grabbe 's judgments of men were often strikingly lenient  --  she had been unattachedwhen they left her in Paris . Besides , Mr. Sciarappa was looking quite presentable this evening , even though he had not yet changed his suit . Bright , eager , intensely polite , useful , informative , he seemed once more the figure they had seen in the train corridor ; some innocent , cavalier hope that had died in those long Milan evenings had revived in him , as the expectation of parting made the two friends recede from him a little and become strangers once more . The letter of introduction wrote itself out , somehow , more affectionatelythan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it said , " please find Mr. Sciarappa , who has been most helpful to us in Milan . " Signorina Grabbe was waiting alone with a gondola in the orange-lampshade glow of a Canaletto sunset when their autobus drew up , two days later , at the station . Against the Venetian panorama of white domes and pink towers , Mr. Sciarappa was so pronouncedly absent thatp 109it seemed an indelicacy to inquire after him . The two friends , whom solitude and a consciousness of indiscretionhad worked up to a pitch of anxiety and melodramaticconjecture , now felt slightly provoked that Miss Grabbe had not , in this short interval , been married or murdered for her money . At the very least , they had expected to be scolded for sending her that curious envoy , but Mr. Sciarappa 's arrival seemed barely to have disturbedMiss Grabbe , who had been busy , so she said , with an inner experience . " Your friend turned up , " she remarked at last , in the tone of one who acknowledges a package . " What on earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young man groaned . Miss Grabbe had put her rich , plump , practiced finger on the flaw in Mr. Sciarappaas prosaically as if he had been a piece of yardgoods  --  wasthere nothing more to be said of him ? " We found him rather odd , " the young man murmured in half-apology . " Oh , my dear , " said Miss Grabbe , raising her dyed black eyebrows , " all the men you meet on the wagons-lits are like that . You must go to the little campos and the trattorias to meet the real Italians . " And as Miss Grabbe went on to talk , in the dipping , swaying gondola , of the intense , insular experience she had found , blazing as the native grappa , in the small , hot squares , the working-class restaurants and dirty churches of Venice , Mr. Sciarappa seemed indeed a poorp 110thing to have offered her , a gimcrack souvenir such as one might have bought in a railway station . The young man blushed angrily as he felt his own trip and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nipped-in gabardine suit . He was only saved from despair by a memory of Miss Grabbe , as he had last seen her in Paris , alone , with her hunter 's look , and three saucers under her vermouth glass , at a table in a Left Bank cafe  --  " Is n't it divine ? " she had called out to him ; " do n't you love it , do n't you hate New York ? " Compared to Miss Grabbe , he perceived , he himself and the young lady would always appear to skim the surface of travel . They were tourists ; Miss Grabbe was an explorer . Looking at the two ladies as they sat facing him in the gondola , he saw that their costumes perfectly expressedthis difference : the young lady 's large black hat , long gloves , high-heeled shoes , and nylon stockings were a declaration of nationality and a stubborn assertion of the pleasure-principle ( what a nuisance that hat had been as it scraped against his neck on the autobus , on the train , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sandals , her bright glass-bead jewelry , her angora sweater , and shoulder-strap leather handbag , all Italian as the merceria , she wore in the manner of a uniform that announcedher mobility in action and her support of the native products . Moreover , her brown face had a weather- p 111beaten look , as though it had been exposed to the glare of many merciless suns ; and her eyes blazed out of the sun-tan powder around them with the bright blue stare of a scout ; only her pretty , tanned legs suggested a life less hardy  --  they might have been going to the beach . Like Mr. Sciarappa ( for all his little graces ) , Miss Grabbe seemed to have been parched and baked by exposure , hardened and chapped by the winds of rebuff and failure . In contrast , the young lady , with her pallor and her smile , looked faintly unreal , like a photograph of a girl whose engagement has just been announced . And the young man felt himself joined to her in this sheltered and changeless beatitude ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grabbe as in that of Mr. Sciarappa , he was aware of a slight discomfort , a sense of fatuity , like the brief , antagonized embarrassment he noticed in himself whenever , in answer to the inevitable question , he replied , with a touch of storminess , that he was travelingin Europe for pleasure . That he and the young lady were happy became , in this context , a crime , or , at best , a breach of taste , like the conspicuous idleness of the rich . They could hardly , he remarked to himself , be expected to give up their mutual delight because others were not so fortunate ; they had already settled this question with regard to steak and cotolette . Yet , catching Miss Grabbe 's eye measuring hisp 112happiness in the gondola , he felt inclined to withdraw his feelings to some more private place , just as certain sensitivepatrons of restaurants preferred nowadays to feast indoors , secure from the appraisal of the poor . His state , as he well knew , was of peculiar interest to Miss Grabbe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous by coming to Europe , semi-annually , in pursuit of love . These sorties of hers had the regularity and the directnessof buyers ' trips that are signalized by a paid notice in the Paris Herald , announcing to the dressmaking trade that Miss Blank of Franklin Simon is staying at the Crillon . Under the eye of that transatlantic experience , the young man felt a little discomfited , as if he had been modeling a housedress before a cosmopolite audience . He had no wish to judge Miss Grabbe , yet he felt installed in a judgment by the dream of perpetual monogamy into which the young lady had invited him . In an effort to extricatehimself , he inquired of Miss Grabbe very civilly , as one traveler to another , how she found the Venetian men , but the heiress only stared at him coldly and asked what he took her for . Miss Grabbe was aware of her legend ; it half-pleased her , and yet she resented it , for , at bottom , she was naively unconscious of the plain purport of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cultural impatiencewith America ; in her own eyes , she was always p 113a rebel against a commercial civilization . She hoped to be remembered for her architectural experiments , her patronage of the arts , her championship of personal freedom , and flattered herself that in Europe this side of her was taken seriously . Men in America , she complained , thought only about business , and the European practice of making a business of love seemed to her , in contrast , the mark of an advanced civilization . Sexual intercourse , someone had taught her , was a quick transaction with the beautiful , and she proceeded to make love , whenever she traveled , as ingenuously as she trotted into a cathedral : men were a continental commodity of which one naturally took advantage , along with the wine and the olives , the bitter coffee and the crusty bread . Miss Grabbe , despite her boldness , was not an original woman , and her boldness , in fact , consisted in taking everything literally . She made love in Europe because it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American lovers ( " My dear , " she told the young lady , " there 's all the difference in the world  --  it 's like cornparingthe very best California claret to the simplest little vin du pays " ) , because she believed it was good for her , especially in hot climates , and because one was said to learn languages a great deal more readily in bed . The rapid turnover of her lovers did not particularly disconcerther ; she took a quantitative view and sought for a p 114wealth of sensations . She liked to startle and to shock , yet positively did not understand why people considered her immoral . A prehensile approach , she inferred , was laudablewhere values were in question  --  what was the beautifulfor , if not to be seized and savored ? For Polly Grabbe , as for the big luxury liners and the small school teachers with their yearly piety of Europe , the war had been an enforced hiatus . Though she had wished for the defeat of Hitler and been generous with money to his victims , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with a purely personal impatience . She was among the first to return when travel was once again permitted , an odd , bedizened , little figure , alighting gallantlyfrom the plane , making a spot of color among the American businessmen , her vulturine co-passengers , who were descending on Europe to " look after " their investments . Conditions in Paris shocked these men , deep in their business sense , and Miss Grabbe was dismayed also ; her own investment had been swept away . She could not take up where she had left off : people were dead or dispersed or in prison ; her past stood about her in fragments , a shattered face looming up here and there like a house-wall in a bombed city ; normalcy was far away . But Miss Grabbe did not lack courage . She had learned how to say good-bye and to look ahead for the next thing . Paris , she quickly decided , was beautiful but donep 115for , a shell from which the life had retreated out into the suburbs where a few old friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existentialist gossip , and an alien troupe of young men who cadged drinks from her in languid boredom and made love only to each other . Her trip to Italy , therefore , had the character of a farewell and a new beginning , and the hotel suite , into which she now showed the two friends , resembled a branch office which had been opened but was not yet in full operation . The wide letto matrimoniale in the bedroom , the washstand , and the bidet with the towel over it , the dressingtableon which were arranged , very neatly and charmingly , Miss Grabbe 's toilet waters and perfumes , her powders and lucite brush and comb , her lipsticks , orange sticks , and tweezers , all had an air unmistakably functional , to which the books and magazines , the cigarettes and pretty colored postcards set out , invitingly , in the sittingroom contributed their share , so that it was not so surprising as it might have been to see , when the balcony doors were opened , the figure of Mr. Sciarappa lounging on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy of Life . This conception of his position , however , seemed not to have struck Mr. Sciarappa . He was there , it seemed , simply for the practical joke of it , for their shrieks , for Miss Grabbe 's discomfiture . He laughed at them withp 116candid merriment , saying , " Caro , I give you a surprise . " The two friends had not seen him so lively since one night in Milan when a tired fat woman , running for a tramcar , had failed to catch it . He showed no inclination at all to step into the role that stood there , ready for him to try on . He had come , he said , as a courier , proposing to take them to dinner , to the Piazza San Marco , to Harry 's Bar , where the smart English officers went and the international set with their electric-blue suits , blonde mistresses , heavy jaws , and decorations from Balkan kings . With all these little offices and services , his mind was completely occupied . His original mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his faculties , and the two friends , observing him , could nearly have sworn that his sole purpose in coming to Venice had been to prepare a place for them , like Jesus for his disciples in Heaven . Dinner , however , soon restored him to his normal state of disaffection . Once the four were seated upstairs , in the yellow lamplight at Quadri 's , he was his old self , bored , petulant , abstracted . He jumped up from his chair with almost indecent agility to speak to a bearded gentleman in a respectable suit of clothes , and came back finally to announce that this was Prince Rucellai , an illustrious Florentine nobleman who practiced the trade of antiquedealer . In the manner of all Mr. Sciarappa 's native p 117acquaintances , the prince at once quitted the restaurant , but Mr. Sciarappa 's attention went with him out into the square , abandoning the Americans summarily for the evening . It was as if he suffered from some curious form of amnesia that made him mislay his purpose halfwayon the road to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why , and he stayed on hoping , somehow , for a refreshment of his memory . Now and then , during the following days , the Americans would find him looking at them with a curious concentration , as though their appearance might recall to him his motive in seeking their society . From Miss Grabbe , on the contrary , whose emeralds should have furnished him his clue , he persistently averted his eyes . The little bohemian heiress , in fact , was the center of his inattention , an inattention principled and profound . From the very first night , apparently , she had associated herself in his mind with culture , and hence , merely by talking about them , she had fallen into the class of objects  --  cathedrals , works of art , museums , palaces maintained by the state  --  which , by being free to all , were valuable , in his opinion , to none . And by the same trick by which he substituted an empty space for the cathedral in the Piazza San Marco , he " vanished " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her buying a palazzo , which she spoke of continually , he simply declined top 118credit . His business interest , it would seem , was far too deep to be aroused by it , and no commission could be large enough to make him expand his idea of money to accommodate within it the living heresy of Miss Grabbe . All over Venice , volunteer real-estate agents were at work for her , the concierge at the Grand Hotel , the liftboy , a gondolier , two Communist painters in a studio across the Canal . Mr. Sciarappa only smiled impatiently whenever this project was mentioned , and once he nudged the young lady and significantly tapped his head . Miss Grabbe , for her part , was unaware of his feelings . The first evening on the balcony , she had expressed herselfstrongly against him . Pointing dramatically to the blue lagoon , the towers , the domes , the clouds , the Palladianfront of San Giorgio , all as pink and white , as airy , watery , clear , and neat as the bottles and puffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's arm and invited him to choose . " My dear , why do you see him ? He is not our sort , " she had said . " Life is too short . He will spoil Venice for you if you let him . " The young man had simply stared . Mr. Sciarappa was a nuisance , but he felt no inclination to trade him for the Venetian " experience . " The bargain was too sharp for his nature . If Mr. Sciarappa obstructed the European view , he also replaced it . The mystery of Europe lay in him as solidly as in the stones of Venice , and it was somewhat less worn p 119by previous inquisitive travelers . Night after night , he and the young lady would sit up examining Mr. Sciarappawith the refined passion of connoisseurs . It was true that sometimes at the dinner-hour they would try to give him the slip , yet they felt a certain relief whenever he rose from behind a potted plant in the hotel lobby to claim , once again , their company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word : the impossibilityof talking with him was compensated for by the possibilities of talking about him , and the detachment of their attitude was , they felt , atoned for by their neighborlinessin the physical sphere . How much , in fact , they had come to feel that they owed Mr. Sciarappa their company , they did not recognize until the afternoon , extraordinaryto them , when he was not on hand to collect the debt . The day of the fiesta he silently disappeared . Like everyone else in Venice he had been planning on the occasion . Colored lanterns had been attached to the gondolas , floats were being decked , and rumors , gay as paper flowers , promised a night of license , masking , and folly . A party of English tourists was expected ; Miss Grabbe was trying on eighteenth-century court costumes with the Communists across the Canal . Apparently , Mr. Sciarappa had set this as the date of his own liberation , for at the aperitif hour he was not to be seen , either atp 120the hotel or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two friends connected his appearance with the arrival of the English tourists , for at the first mention of their existence , his mind had ducked underground , into the tunnel where his real life was conducted . They had known him long enough to see him as a city of Catacombs , and to interpret his lapses of attention as signs of the keenest interest ; his silences were the camouflaged entrances to the Plutonianrealm of his thoughts . Nevertheless , they felt slightly shocked and abandoned . Like many intellectual people , they were alarmed by the confirmation of theories  --  was the world as small as the mind ? They telephoned their hotel twice , but their friend had left no messages for them , and , disturbed , they allowed Miss Grabbe to go off with her maskers while they watched on the cold jetty the little gondolas chasing up and down the Canal in pursuit of the great floating orchestra which everybody had seen in the afternoon but which now , like Mr. Sciarappa , had unaccountably disappeared . Some time later , they perceived Mr. Sciarappa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pier . They would not have recognized him had he not called out effusively , " Ah , my friends , I am looking for you all over Venice tonight . " The full force of this lie was lost on them , for they were less astonished to find Scampi in a falsehood than p 121to find him in a new suit . In dark blue and white stripes , he stepped out of the gondola ; gold links gleamed at his wrists ; his face was soft from the barbershop , and a strong fragrance of Chanel caused passers-by to turn to stare at them . The bluish-white glare from the dome of San Giorgio , lit up for the occasion , fell on him , accentuatingthe moment . The heavier material had added a certain substantiality to him ; like the men in Harry 's Bar , he looked sybaritic , prosperous , and vain . But this transfiguration was , it became clear , merely the afterglow of some hope that had already set for him . Wherever he had been , he had failed to accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the vague adventure of a carnival night . He was more nervous than ever , and he invited them to join him on the Canal in the manner of a man who is weighing the security of companionship against the advantages of the lone hand . The two friends declined , and he put off once more in the gondola , saying , " Well , my dears , you are right ; it is just a tourist fiesta . " The two retired to their window to wonder whether the English tourists , and not themselves or Miss Grabbe , had not been , after all , the real Venetian attraction . The Inglesi 's arrival might well have been anticipated in a newspaper , particularly since they had the reputation of being rich collectors of furniture . Mr. Sciarappa 's restlessbehavior , irrational in a pursuer who has alreadyp 122come up with his prey , was appropriate enough to the boredom and anxiety of waiting . Indeed , sometimes , watching him drum on the table , they had said to themselvesthat he behaved toward them like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station and vainly tries to interest himself in the billboard and the ticket collector . Miss Grabbe had taken very little part in all this mental excitement . So far as the two friends could see , he had no erotic interest for her . She was as adamant to his virility as he to the evidence of her money  --  it would have disturbed all her preconceptions to discover sex in a business suit . She received his disappearance calmly , saying , " I thought you wanted to get rid of him  --  he has probably found bigger fish . " In general , after her first protest , she had grown accustomed to Mr. Sciarappa , in the manner of the rich . For her he did not assume prominence through the frequency of his attendance , but on the contrary he receded into the surroundings in the fashion of a piece of furniture that is " lived with . " She opened and closed him like a guidebook whenever she needed the name of a hotel or a hairdresser or had forgotten the Italian for what she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had little real curiosity ; she was not a dependent of the world . It did not occur to her to inquire why he had come , nor did she ask when hep 123would leave . She too spoke of him as " Scampi , " but tolerantly , without resentment , as nice women call a dog a rascal . She was not , despite appearances , a woman of strong convictions ; she accepted any current situation as normative and was not anxious for change . Her money had made her insular ; she was used to a mercenary circle and had no idea that outside it lovers showed affection , friends repaid kindness , and husbands did not ask an allowance or bring their mistresses home to bed . So now she accepted Mr. Sciarappa 's dubious presence without particular question ; it struck her as far less unnatural than the daily affection she witnessed between the young man and the young lady . She domesticated all the queernessof his being with them in Venice . " My dear , " she remonstrated with the young man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissipating Sciarappa as succinctly as if he had been a Fuller Brush man at the door . It irritated them slightly that she would not see the problem of Sciarappa , and they did not guess that now , when they had given up expecting it , she would grapple with their problem more matter-of-factly than they . While the two friends slept , through the night of the fiesta she and Mr. Sciarappa made love ; when he departed , in dressing gown and slippers , she thanked him " for a very pleasant evening . Mr. Sciarappa , however , did not stay to cement the p 124relationship . He left Venice precipitately , as though retreatingahead of Miss Grabbe 's revelations . He was gone the next afternoon , without spoken adieus , leaving behind him a list of the second-best restaurants in Florencefor the young lady , with an asterisk marking the ones where he was personally known to the headwaiter . " Unhappily , " his note ran , " one can not be on a holiday forever . " On a final zigzag of policy he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had declared himself in action , his motives seemed the more obscure . What , in fact , had he been up to ? It was impossible to find out from Miss Grabbe , for to her mind sex went without explanations ; it seemed to her perfectly ordinarythat two strangers who were indifferent to each other should spend the night locked in the privacies of love . Sitting up in bed , surrounded by hot-water bottles ( for she had caught cold in her stomach ) , she received the two friends at tea-time and related her experiences of the night , using confession matter-of-factly , as a species of feminine hygiene , to disinfect her spirit of any lingeringtouch of the man . Scampi , she said , accepting the nickname from the young man as a kind of garment for the Italian gentleman , who seemed to stand there before them , shivering and slightly chicken-breasted in the nude , Scampi , she said , was very nice , but not in anyp 125way remarkable , the usual Italian man . He had taken her back from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had grown tired of the painters , who looked ridiculous in costume when no one else was dressed . He had pinched her bottom on the Riva and undressed her on the balcony ; they had tussled and gone to bed . Upon the cold stage of Miss Grabbe 's bald narrative , he capered in and out like a grotesque , now naked , chasing her naked onto the balcony , now gorgeous in a silk dressing-gown and slippers tiptoeing down the corridorof the hotel , now correct in light tan pajamas dutifully , domestically , turning out the light . For a moment , they saw him all shrunken and wizened . ( " My dear , he is much older than you think , " said Miss Grabbe confidentially ) , and another glimpse revealed him in an aspect still more intimate and terrible , tossing the scapularhe wore about his neck , and which hung down and interfered with his love-making , back again and again , lightly , flippantly , recklessly , over his thin shoulder . " Stop , " cried the young lady , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agony of repentance to her own bosom . " Does it shock you ? " inquired Miss Grabbe , lifting her black eyebrows . " Darling , you gave me Sciarappa . " " No , no , " begged the young lady , for it seemed to her that this was not at all what they had wanted , this mortalp 126expose , but that , on the contrary , they had had in mind something more sociological , more humane  --  biographicaldetails , Mr. Sciarappa 's relation with his parents , his social position , his business , his connection with the Fascist state . But of all this , of course , Miss Grabbe could tell them nothing . The poor Italian , hunted down , defenseless , surprised in bed by a party of intruders , had yielded nothing but his manhood . His motives , his status , his true public and social self , everything that the young lady now called " the really interesting part about him , " he had carried off with him to Rome intact . He was gone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unexpectedlyold . Through Miss Grabbe , they had come as close to him bodily as the laws of nature permit , and there at the core there was nothing  --  they had known him better in the Galleria in Milan . As for the affective side of him , the emotions and sentiments , here too he had eluded them . Miss Grabbe 's net had been too coarse to catch whatever small feelings had escaped him during the encounter . A sense of desolation descended on the room , the usual price of confidences . It was a relief when one of the Communist painters came in with some lira , which Miss Grabbe put in her douche-bag . The two friends exchanged a glance of illumination . Had this repository for his country'sdebased currency proved too casual for Mr. Scia-p 127rappa 's sense of honor ? Was this the cause of his flight ? If so , was it the lira or his manhood that was insulted ? Or were the two , in the end , indistinguishable ? The two friends could never be sure , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether some tactlessness of Miss Grabbe 's had set Scampi at last in motion or whether his own action , by committing him for an hour or so , had terrified him into instant removal . He was a theoretician of practice so pure , they said to each other on the bus , that any action must appear to him as folly because of the risks to his shrewdness that it involved , a man so worldly that he saw the world as a lie too transparent to fool Rino Sciarappa , who was clever and knew the ropes . As they passed through the bony Apennines , the landscape itself seemed to wear a face baked and disabused as Mr. Sciarappa 's own , and thus to give their theories a geological and national cast . The terraced fields lay scorched , like Mr. Sciarappa 's wrinkles , on the gaunt umber-colored hillsides ; like his vernal hopes , plants sprang up only to die here , and the land had the mark of wisdom  --  it too had seen life . After these reflections , it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival in Florence , the face of Italian history , whose destination had been announcedas Rome . " He is following us , but he is ahead , " said the young man , abandoning historical explanationsp 128forever . Only one conclusion seemed possible  --  he must be a spy . In Florence , at any rate , he appeared to be acquainted ; he introduced them to a number of American girls who worked in United States offices and to one or two young men who wore American uniforms . All of these people , as he had once promised them in Venice , called him by his first name ; yet when the dinner-hour drew near the whole party vanished as agilely as Mr. Sciarappa , and the two friends found themselves once more going to his favorite restaurant , drinking his favorite wine , and being snubbed first by the waiter and then by their impatient guide . If he was a spy , however , his superiors must at last have given him a new assignment , for the next day he left Florence , not without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Rome , curiosity led them , at long last , and with some reluctance , to investigate his address , which he had written out in the young lady 's address book long ago , on the train , outside Domodossola , when their acquaintancehad promised to be of somewhat shorter duration . As their steps turned into the dusty Via San Ignazio , they felt their hearts quicken . The European enigma and its architectural solution lay just before them , around a bend in the street , and they still , in spite of everything , should not have been surprised to find a renaissance palace , ap 129coat of arms , and a liveried manservant just inside the door . But the house was plain and shabby ; it was impossible to conceive of Mr. Sciarappa 's gabardines proceedingdeftly through the entrance . Looking at this yellow house , at the unshaven tenant in his undershirt regarding them from the third-story window , and the mattress and the geranium in the fourth , the two friends felt a return of that mortification and unseemly embarrassment they had experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obscenity , like the shrunken skin and the scapular , but it also was a shell which Rino Sciarappa did not truly inhabit . By common consent , they turned silently away from it , with a certain distaste which , oddly enough , was not directed at Mr. Sciarappa or his residence , but , momentarily , at each other . The relation betweenpursuer and pursued had been confounded , by a dialectic too subtle for their eyes . p 131To THE young man in the hospital nightshirt , the continuousmoaning of the old voice across the hall was at first a simple irritant , like the clanking of radiator pipes . Could not somebody put a stop to it ? was his involuntary , impatient query . He was furious with the hospital , with the doctor , and above all with his own irrelevance in having fallen off a ladder in his friend 's New England studio and landed here , at the county seat , with ap 132broken elbow , in the private wing of an institution that , in everything but the charge per diem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying " Nurse , nurse ! " from just across the corridor , groaning , quavering , soughing , seemed to typify everything that was antiquated and unnecessary in the whole situation . Despitethe young man 's efforts to take a more humane view , the notion that his old neighbor could be turned off with one severe twist of the wrist , like a leaking faucet , persisted in the young man 's head , together with the conviction that he himself , in the old man 's position , would have shown more self-control . Once he had allowed himself to voice this comparative judgment , however , he was immediately filled with chagrin , for he was a just young man , of a cool but chivalrous disposition , and he recognized that there had been nothing , as yet , in his young life to test his powers of self-restraint ; all he could say with positiveness was that in order to utter such vivid groans as proceeded from the opposite room he would have to be a different person  --  i.e. , to be ailing and old . Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary , rosy-cheeked , gold-haired , well-favored , a graduatestudent of history at Harvard University , the indulgedson of his parents , did not dispose of his irritation . In fact , it only quickened it by making it appearp 133unreasonable . To grit his teeth and endeavor not to hear would have been the conventional recourse , but his native hospitality and politeness now suddenly forbade him to eliminate the suffering old man from his consciousness , even if this had been physically possible . He felt a social obligation to listen . Yet the faculty of sympathetic attention , the young man rapidly discovered , as he tried remorsefullyto exercise it , is like the faculty of hearing : it ceases to reply to a regularly offered stimulus , just as one ceases to be able to hear a clock ticking in a room . He found , upon experiment , that it was possible to replenishhis compassion by picturing the old man as dying ( in the manner of a jaded libertine who resorts to a mental image to resuscitate the inert fact of love ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his imagination . In a very short time , he resigned himself to the truth that he could feel sad about the old man but not really sorry , and that for every squeeze of generalized pity , there was a spurt of concrete hatred and repugnance . " Am I a monster ? " he asked himself curiously . " Or is this what everyone secretly feels toward another 's ills , toward the intrusion of a foreign body into the consciousness  --  areflex of distaste and censure ? " In common with many of his generation who had missed the overseas war , he had kept , up to this moment , a boy 's methodical piety toward the paraplegic , the refugee , the concentration- p 134camp inmate , and even , in a peculiar way ( typical also of his age and class ) , toward the torturer , who seemed to share somehow with the victim the distinction of participating in the actual . Now with the actual close at hand , in the form of a living sufferer , he was astonished to find it more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his purposes and interests , than the sight of a plane crashing he had recently watched in a newsreel . A slight tremor of anxiety went through him : would others extrude him from their midst so casually when his time came , or was he himself deficient in the ordinary corpuscles of humanity ? A screen had been cutting off his view of the invalid across the hall , but at mealtime he gradually became aware of a process of ingestion that was going on in that room , a steady munching and salivating , which he felt rather than heard . This surprised him very much , and once , when the screen was moved , he caught a glimpse of a lump of bedclothes in the middle of the iron bedstead , which surprised him also , in the same way . There was something very active in that lump , very much alive , though how a mere convexity of bedclothes could communicate that impression , the young man could not tell . All along , some reasoner in himself had been urging on him the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the fact that such a suggestion could even occur to him was so shocking to his conscience that he had not stopped to consider it on its merits . Now , however , he sat up in bed and began to attend more objectively to his neighbor , who at present was banging feebly with what sounded like a spoon on a glass . A nurse grumbled next door in the diet kitchen ; there was a rustle of starched skirts . " Use your bell , Mr. Ciccone , " she commanded . A faint moan answered her ; a creak of arch-preservers followed , as the nurse moved swiftly toward the bed . " Mr. Ciccone ! " she cried sharply . The young man 's heart gave a lurch ( " Forgive me , " he dumbly articulated , winging the thought after the old man , to catch him there , on the brink ) , but then from behind the screen came a grunt and a gurgling tobaccoey noise , like the mirth of a subterranean river-god . The old man was laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abruptly coalesced : the name Mr. Ciccone , the pictorial bass with a crack in it , the tremolo and the quaver . Mr. Ciccone was acting . And instantly that collection of noises , to which the young man had been vainly striving to assign a poignant universal reality , acquired life and character . The unseen Mr. Ciccone presented himself : yellow skin , rheumy yet brilliant black eyes , white mustachios , thin liver-spotted hands , long white nightshirt . An Italian grocer , the young man conjectured , with a son in dentistry p 136or the automobile business ; a natural obstructionist and fraud , posed , in a white apron , with a mime 's sense of the picturesque , against the escarole and the pomegranates , the barrels of imported almonds and walnuts , weighing out the parmigiano on the non-Detecto scales . The young man laughed joyously aloud . Mr. Ciccone was off his conscience and lodged preferentially in his heart . From this moment , he came to wait for the groans and laments , for the plaintive tinkle of the spoon on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle against the bedpan and the hypodermic syringe . Mr. Ciccone , as he soon learned from one of the interns , was not in fact very sick ; a leg injury and a mild diabetic condition had combined to put him in the hospital , where he was regarded as a " character " by the nurses on the floor . All day long , they scolded the disobedient old party , who was continually bored and mischievous but never would trust his bell to summon attention . He felt cozened by this " bell " or light , not being able to hear it ring , and preferred to rely , in any personal emergency , on his own histrionicpowers , weakly crying , " Nurse , nurse ! " , tapping with the spoon on the glass , gasping , choking , playing dead . He was able to counterfeit extremity with such various and graphic realism that , though he had been some time in the hospital , the nurses would still rustle in alarm down the corridor ( " Coming , Mr. Ciccone ! " ) , p @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn up to his chin , chuckling at them and demanding a game of casino or a glass of Coca-Cola . Sometimes , when a new student relief nurse was on the corridor , Mr. Ciccone would actually get his way and would be sitting up in bed , finishingthe forbidden beverage , when the head floor-nurse would fly in , all indignant cap and rattling keys  --  " Why , Mr. Ciccone , you know that Coca-Cola is bad for you "  --  and whisk the glass out of the room . Mr. Ciccone , naturally , took medicine only under protest . He would bargain for a game of cards in exchange for good behavior , and , failing this , two or three times a day he would put up a convincing resistance to the sedatives , enemas , milk of magnesia , penicillin or insulin injectionscalled for by his chart , only stopping short of direct physical combat , and , having concentrated a whole battery of nurses in his room , submitting all of a sudden with an exaggerated show of weakness as though to twit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these submissions , he would moan for a long time , harrowingly , so that the delighted young man across the way could trace ( as he knew someone was meant to ) the whole nefarious course of the medicine down Mr. Ciccone 's injured gullet into his protesting stomach or through the tissues of his aged buttocks up to his shuddering heart. p 138The young man , too , execrated the routines of the hospital . The dreary food , dirty rooms , noise , lack of conveniences , the understaffed and officious personnel with its eternal " Doctor 's orders " vexed his intellect far more than his comfort , yet , on his own behalf , as a private patient , he could not nerve himself to complain . Conditionsin hospitals all over the country , so he had heard , or read in an article , were nearly as absurd as this ; someoneought to speak out against being waked up , as he was , two and a quarter hours before breakfast , at six every morning , on the pretext of having his temperature taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuming he had been allowed to fall asleep ) at three in the afternoon with a basin of lukewarm water , a toothbrush , and an order to " wash up " for the night . The idea of paying twelve dollars a day for this nonchalant and peremptory " care " was a constant insult to his acumen , but to protest on this basis was to imply that , had he been paying less , he would have had fewer grounds for objections . This , to a young man of liberal views , was not a tenable position . For purposes of social criticism , he could have wished himself a patient in the wards , where the very generalized injustice of the situation would have given him a right to speak . Shyness , the wish to appear a " good " patient , chivalry toward the nurses , all contributed to silence his criticism , but in his own eyes he was re- p 139strained , above all , by the sense that a demonstration against bureaucratic routine and authoritarian slovenlinesson the part of a single private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What he had seen , however , of conditions in the private wing did not inspire him to transfer to the men 's ward for the mere privilege of playing the rebel there . He was determined simply to get well and he shut of this place as quickly as possible . He had been put in the hospital by his friend , and by his friend 's wife , whom , as a matter of fact , he had been leaning forward to kiss when he fell off the ladder in the studio . They had sent him a bunch of bronze chrysanthemums and left him more or less to himself ; he could imagine that Mrs. X regarded the fall as some sort of " judgment " for their series of desultory indiscretions ; she had not , in any case , during their single stiff visit to his bedside , directed her eyes fully into his . For this , the young man was thankful . For his own part , he had no wish to see either of the Xes again and had only feared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would enclose him in a triangle by a sheer convention of the prevailing social geometry . Whatever had happened to prevent this  --  whether Mrs. X had " told " her husband , whether he had " guessed , " or whether the accident had brought homep 140to them what a nuisance , after all , other people ( guests , in particular ) really were , a common discovery of couples  --  theyoung man did not care . Throughout their visit , he himself had chattered incessantly about the hospital , Mr. Ciccone , the personal traits of the different nurses , never stopping to inquire about the farm , the pig , the projected dinner party , Mr. X 's painting , while husband and wife exchanged glances , like promissory notes on a future conversation , indicating that they would never have believed , if illness and isolation had not shown them , how intensely trivial and self-centered this friend in the nightshirt was . The solitude in which they left him , and the repudiationof their transient intimacy , gave the young man occasion to assess in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all identifying marks and validatingreferences , was lying cranked up in the scarred hospital bed . His preoccupation with the gossip of the corridor was , he quite readily conceded , a confession of envy and inferiority . He felt a sort of jealousy of this whole affaire world of illness and medication from which he was excluded . He wished to know its language and be accepted by it , yet the consciousness that his injury was a minor one made him hesitate to trench upon it . He believed that the nurses looked askance at him and treated him with subtle discrimination , as though p 141questioning the professional wisdom of the doctor in detaininghim here so long . He would have liked to say that he agreed with them , that he , too , could not understand why a mere fractured elbow should require so protracteda stay in bed , to assure them that it was not of his own desire but by the arbitrary will of another that he was there presuming on their patience . This sense of his own nothingness in contradistinction to some darker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from childhood . The tone of his mother 's voice , sad , velvety , genuflectory , pronouncing the words " They 're poor " came back to him now with horror . " And are we rich ? " he heard himself pipe . " No , dear , just comfortable "  --  the tone was of modest complacency , tinted with social awareness . In Cambridge , among his fellows , with the Xes , even , on their farm , he had achieved a minor entree  --  he could be found , like a point on a social graph . But here , where no attachments secured him , where no one knew his history or his friends , he felt himself suddenly floating , uncircumstantiated , a mere transparency , and this sense of himself as an absence was so compelling that he was startled by the sight of his face , which looked at him through its eyeholes like a Christmas mask when they brought him in a mirror to shave by . The mortification of being alone , unvisited , unjustified , of having his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given to check for his choice of dishes , of having no bedroom slippers or pajamas ( a la mode enough in Cambridge but a source of daily wonder here ) had so wrought upon him that he had anticipated , without realizingit , an actual pauperization of his features . The sight of the familiar gold forelock , full lips , and snub nose was terribly disconcerting , as though he looked upon himself in effigy . To exist , he suddenly became convinced , was an act of deliberate impersonation . Mr. Ciccone , across the hall , being shaved with an electric razor by a party of laughing student nurses , was a living warrant of this ; Mr. Ciccone , imitating old age in a high infirm quaver , was both actor and regisseur  --  he had seized his part from the director and was executing it con amore . The young man listened with envy ; the juvenile bit assigned him and , with him , his whole class and generation of soft-voiced , accommodating extras was too shadowy ; he had no cue to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked himself , that sustained Mr. Ciccone and , for that matter , all the lively old mountebanksof the era  --  Yeats , Augustus John , Freud , Einstein , Churchill ? Surely not belief in the self , since the self , as these old men knew , was a joke , a nothing , a point du depart . Mere virtuosity perhaps , and a growing closetful of stage effects  --  the paunch , the wrinkle , the limp ; the p 143jowl , the shank , the bald pate . In the Santa Claus suit of old age , beneath the padding and the pillow , some spry punchinello had hold of the vital principle of artifice . The young man had been in the hospital two or three days and was sitting up , with bathroom privileges , before a certain suspicion that had been attaching itself to Mr. Ciccone became a verified fact . Mr. Ciccone , like Homer , was not a single individual but a collaboration . There were , astonishingly , four old men on the corridor , of whom the one called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bedded in private or semi-private rooms , two of them incontinent , all insubordinate , unsubdued , sworn enemies , every one , of the bedpan , the catheter , and the needle . Antiphonally or singly , they kept up a sort of plain chant , a thin , wheezy dirge that went on , all day long in its eerie unaccentual modality : At certain times of the day , this cry became more vocifer-ous , when the student nurse , for example , passed through the wing with the penicillin injections . Her entry to the semi-private rooms , at the far end of the corridor , was announcedby a violent hubbub : imprecations , sobbing , p 144pleading , the occasional crash of falling furniture . The young man would lay aside his book and wait for the authoritative creak of the head floor nurse proceeding to the scene , the sound of feminine chiding ( " Mr. Wright , you 're not being thoughtful , you 're not being thoughtful at all " ) , the shriek , and then the after-cry , piercing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nurse went on to the next room , to the women , who made no sound , and finally to Mr. Ciccone and himself . In the case of two feeblest old men down the hall , sincerityand trumpery , so far as the young man could determine , were blended in the act of resistance . The needle , of course , did not hurt much , but in the lumbar regions of their spirit , something , plainly , was being violated . They were childish , in the nurses ' phrase ; there was a blur in their minds between actual pain and the imagined representation of it ; they did not trouble to distinguish and acted out every fancy with a pure , innocent sort of expressiveness . Mr. Ciccone , by contrast , was a conscious artist and a borrower . Sometimes , in the afternoon , the young man would overhear him softly rehearsing a sound effect p 145that he had picked up from one of his coevals , essaying it again and again , tentatively , like someone practicing on a flute . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully developed , would suddenly issue from Mr. Ciccone 's room , to be taken up again by one of the other Methuselahs , reminded by it of his own aches and miseries , so that the whole corridor would echo with the plaint of the old men , and the single , stolid night nurse would clump , scolding , into the diet kitchen , shut the door , and heat herself a cup of coffee . This troupe of ancients , as if to confirm the young man 's theories , was handled by the hospital staff , at any critical juncture , with precisely that mixture of indulgence and asperity that characterizes the plain man in his relations-with the artist . On the night that the two incontinentold fellows broke a draining-tube and drank a bottle of gentian violet between them , climbed out of bed and shouted in the corridor , an orderly , like a stagehand , came whistling down the hall to subdue them . " What will they think of next ? " a white-haired nurse demanded , poking her head gratuitously into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , the elevator gates clashed . Only Mr. Ciccone 's room remained dark and almost ostentatiouslypeaceful , though the young man 's ear caught the sound of a dry chuckle , repeated at intervals . Yet the fact was , as the cleaning woman , shaking her head and p 146her mop , confided to the young man in voluptuous brogue the next morning , one of those old rapscallions had just missed a date with Saint Peter . All the while , the women patients were silent . He had learned from one of the nurses that a woman was dying of cancer somewhere in the private wing , but only once , during his first days in the hospital , did he hear a woman 's voice that was not that of a nurse or a visitor  --  a young woman 's laugh and the sound of a door closing on it . This feminine silence began to disturb him very much ; the idea that sick women of various ages and complaints were lying , blanketed , all around him , behind half-closed doors , each sheltering her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had the effect on him of a tactile sensation  --  as though he were encased in felt . He found himself with a strange , pressing desire to uncover that female suffering , to make it reveal itself to him by a sob , a gasp , a murmur , to have his ear know its contours , like a pleasure . On the fourth night of his stay , he was awakened suddenly , out of a deep sleep , by prolonged shrieks coming from the darkness , a woman 's voice raised again and again in screams of such appalling vibrancy that his hair stood up on his head . " The cancer patient , at last ! "  --  the jubilant ex , clamation sprang out of him , quite unintentionally . He sat straight up in bed to listen , trembling with cold and ex- p 147citement . Here there was no question of hearing or not hearing ; these cries transfixed him with horror and yet he listened to them , fascinated , in the tingling stealth of discovery . He knew immediately that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a being that yielded them against its will ; yet in this fact , precisely , lay their power to electrify the attention . " A dying woman screaming in the night , " the young man repeated musingly , as the cries stopped , at their very summit , as abruptly as they had started , leaving a pounding stillness , " this is the actual ; the actual , in fact , is that which should not be witnessed . The actual , " he defined , pronouncing the syllables slowly and distinctly in a pedagogical style , " under which may be subsumed the street accident , the plane crash , the atrocity , is pornography . " Closing his eyes , he sank back on a long breath of relief . He awakened the next morning with a vivid feeling of joy and liberation , as if during the night a responsibility had been sloughed off . He felt blithe and ready to live , selfishly and inconsiderately , like the expressive old men ; the actual no longer drew him with its womanish terrors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold eye on life , on death , " he sang out , borrowing from old Yeats 's tombstone . " Horseman , pass by . " He was positively elated , in fact , to be young , healthy , and hungry , and , as he meant to tell Dr. Z as soon as he ap-p 148peared on his rounds , determined to go home to Cambridgeon the one-o'clock train . This elation induced in him an unusual talkativeness ; to the fat grumpy old nurse who came in with the thermometer , he could not resist an allusion to what he had heard during the night . The old nurse surveyed him tersely , shook down the thermometerwithout comment , unpinned her watch from her uniform , and , snapping her fingers impatiently , extended her veined hand for his pulse . " Maternity case , " she finally surmised , handing him his toothbrush and the tin basin . " You wo n't hear a sound out of Mrs. Miller mentioning the name of the cancer patient . She 's quiet as a lamb next door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that deathy stillness so near him ; he had imaginedthe next room to be empty , for not a sound had issued from it , and passing it on his trips down the hall to the bathroom , he had observed that the door was alwaysshut . The next question was drawn from him by a compulsion ; he did not wish to ask it and threw it out with diffidence : " She is under opiates , I suppose ? " The nurse surveyed him again with a short , measuring movement of the eye . " Brush your teeth , now , " she commandedcurtly . " You know we are not permitted to give out information about the other patients . " She withdrew the bedpan from the commode , jerked off the towel that shrouded it , and slid it under the covers . " Put your light p 149on when you 're through , " she directed . The young man sat up . " But I am allowed to go to the bathroom ! " he exclaimed . " Not this morning , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bed this morning . " " But why ? " demandedthe young man , now thoroughly alarmed and suspicious . The nurse 's creased face snapped shut . " Curiositykilled the cat , " she retorted . " Doctor will be in early to see you . " " I demand  --  " cried the young man after her , as she bustled out , leaving the door open , but he broke off , conscious of absurdity , for what he had been about to say was " I demand to see a lawyer , " which was ridiculous , for he was certainly free to get up and dress and leave the hospital . The idea of flight suddenly offered itself to him as the only feasible solution . He pictured , with a return of his early-morning gaiety , the rubbersoledchase down the corridor , the escape down the firestairs . His imagination , however , faltered at the thought of the office : to leave without paying was unthinkable , yet would they be likely to take a check from him under such unusual conditions ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question to the test . He felt unequal to the imagined commotion  --  the painstaking verification of identity , the call to his bank in Boston  --  and for what purpose , he asked himself , would I do all that , for the mere assertion of my individuality ? For the sake of another , he reasoned , I could conceivably do it , if it were a question of rescue p 150or sacrifice ; but for myself ? He lay back dutifully on the bedpan and in a moment put on his light . The nurse came in and he said coldly , " In the future , would you take the trouble to close the door when you leave the room , particularly during these intimate moments ? " Yet even as he began to speak , he felt himself blushing and the final phrase , to which he had meant to impart a sarcastic intonation , were mumbled out thickly , in a tone , almost , of apology . The nurse threw the cover over the bedpan and went out , closing the door behind her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Z appeared , all gold fillings , hair en brosse , smile , and rimless spectacles . " We are goingto reset that elbow for you , " he announced . " Anyoneyou want to get in touch with ? " The young man opened his mouth to argue . He was free ( was he not ? ) , he reminded himself , to get up and dress and leave the hospital . He had only to refuse . The Xes , if it came down to it , could be summoned to bail him out of here . Dr. Z , after all , had no title or charter to his patronage . He had only to tell him that he preferred to have the arm reset , if necessary , in Cambridge , where he had friends and a regular physician ; there was nothing in this preference that was derogatory to Dr. Z. The doctor , in his white gown , stood looking down at him , smiling rather inscrutably , as though he were very much aware of what wasp 151going on in the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he suggested , with a flick of the sterile glance in the direction of the dying chrysanthemums , " do you want us to give them a call ? " A student nurse knocked and came in with a tray and a hypodermic needle . The young man 's jaws worked and he shook his head wordlesslyin reply . It was too late ; in the presence of this attentive listener he could not refuse Dr. Z what suddenly , in a curious fashion , appeared to be a favor , the favor of letting him operate on him . The abominable doctor smiled again , lightly , and tapped the foot of the bed in a negligent gesture that seemed to imply a mixture of contempt and approbation , as if he had had little doubt of the outcome of this conflict between them but was nevertheless satisfied to have won . On the way up to the operating room , being wheeled breezily along by an orderly humming " Who ? " the young man had a sudden clear sharp sense of all that he had omitted to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which now , irrecoverably perhaps , he thought in panic , he was being trundled away . " Stop , " he asserted faintly , raising his head on the pallet . The idea of defendinghimself still reached him as from a distance through the drug : Mr. Ciccone , he thought , would never have permitted this ; in Mr. Ciccone , he considered ten- p 152derly , he had an ally , a veteran aider and abettor . Why , he demanded of himself , had he not taken the simple friendly course , yesterday , when he was sitting up in a chair , of offering to join his neighbor in a game of casino ? The orderly had paused to look down at him . " What 's the matter , chum ? " he inquired . The young man struggled up from the confining blankets . They were waiting for the elevator , he realized ; it was not too late , if he were insistent , to make a date with Mr. Ciccone for this afternoon or tomorrow ; the fact that this notion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and necessary , all the more talismanic . He jerked his raised head in the direction of Mr. Ciccone 's room . " I must speak to the patient in Number Three , " he pronounced , with an effect of hauteur and dignity . The orderly lifted shaggy red eyebrows , peered down the elevator shaft , shrugged , and consentinglyset the stretcher in motion , retracing their way along the corridor . " Friend of yours ? " he remarked . In the flush of this victory over self and custom , the young man grew excited and voluble ; a passing nurse turned back to look at them . " No , " he said . " To tell the truth , I 've never actually seen him . " The orderly stared and bumped the stretcher to a standstill , but they were alreadyopposite Number Three . The screen had been moved and the young man hastily nerved himself for the pos- p 153sibility that the real Mr. Ciccone might be something quite different from what he had imagined  --  a cantankerous misanthrope , for example , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaded room across the way into which his dilated eyes stared was empty , the bed made up and flat . Fifteen minutes later , the young man expired under the anesthetic , before the operation proper had begun , the first case of its kind , as Dr. Z explained to Mrs. X , that he had ever come across in his entire practice , where the heart , without organic defect , sound as a bell , in fact , simply stopped beating . p 157WHENEVER we children came to stay at my grandmother 's house , we were put to sleep in the sewing room , a bleak , shabby , utilitarian rectangle , more office than bedroom , more attic than office , that played to the hierarchy of chambers the role of a poor relation . It was a room seldom entered by the other members of the family , seldom swept by the maid , a room without pride ; the old sewing machine , some cast-off chairs , a shadeless lamp , rolls ofp 158wrapping paper , piles of cardboard boxes that might someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of material united with the iron folding cots put out for our use and the bare floor boards to give an impression of intense and ruthless temporality . Thin white spreads , of the kind used in hospitals and charity institutions , and naked blinds at the windows reminded us of our orphaned condition and of the ephemeral character of our visit ; there was nothing here to encourage us to consider this our home . Poor Roy 's children , as commiseration damply styled the four of us , could not afford illusions , in the family opinion . Our father had put us beyond the pale by dying suddenly of influenza and taking our young mother with him , a defection that was remarked on with horror and grief commingled , as though our mother had been a pretty secretary with whom he had wantonly absconded into the irresponsible paradise of the hereafter . Our reputationwas clouded by this misfortune . There was a prevailingsense , not only in the family but among storekeepers , servants , streetcar conductors , and other satellitesof our circle , that my grandfather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in allotting a sum of money for our support and installing us with some disagreeable middle-aged relations in a dingy house two blocks distant from his own . What alternative p 159he had was not mentioned ; presumably he could have sent us to an orphan asylum and no one would have thought the worse of him . At any rate , it was felt , even by those who sympathized with us , that we led a privileged existence , privileged because we had no rights , and the very fact that at the yearly Halloween or Christmas party given at the home of an uncle we appeared so dismal , ill clad , and unhealthy , in contrast to our rosy , exquisite cousins , confirmed the judgment that had been made on us  --  clearly , it was a generous impulse that kept us in the family at all . Thus , the meaner our circumstances , the greater seemed our grandfather 's condescension , a view in which we ourselves shared , looking softly and shyly on this old man  --  with his rheumatism , his pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his PierceArrowand in his buttonhole  --  as the font of goodness and philanthropy , and the nickel he occasionally gave us to drop into the collection plate on Sunday ( two cents was our ordinary contribution ) filled us not with envy but with simple admiration for his potency ; this indeed was princely , this was the way to give . It did not occur to us to judge him for the disparity of our styles of living . Whatever bitterness we felt was kept for our actual guardians , who , we believed , must be embezzling the money set aside for us , since the standard of comfort achieved in our grandparents ' house  --  the electric heaters , p 160the gas logs , the lap robes , the shawls wrapped tenderly about the old knees , the white meat of chicken and red meat of beef , the silver , the white tablecloths , the maids , and the solicitous chauffeur  --  persuaded us that prunes and rice pudding , peeling paint and patched clothes were hors concours with these persons and therefore could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was equivalent to bounty , and poverty but a sign of penuriousnessof spirit . Yet even if we had been convinced of the honesty of our guardians , we would still have clung to that beneficentimage of our grandfather that the family myth proposed to us . We were too poor , spiritually speaking , to question his generosity , to ask why he allowed us to live in oppressed chill and deprivation at a long arm 's length from himself and hooded his genial blue eye with a bluff , millionairish gray eyebrow whenever the evidence of our suffering presented itself at his knee . The official answer we knew : our benefactors were too old to put up with four wild young children ; our grandfather was preoccupied with business matters and with his rheumatism , to which he devoted himself as though to a pious duty , taking it with him on pilgrimages to Ste. Anne de Beaupre and Miami , offering it with impartial reverence to the miracle of the Northern Mother and the Southern lr , p 161sun . This rheumatism hallowed my grandfather with the mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner of an artist or a grizzled Galahad ; it set him apart from all of us and even from my grandmother , who , lacking such an affliction , led a relatively unjustified existence and showed , in relation to us children , a sharper and more bellicose spirit . She felt , in spite of everything , that she was open to criticism , and , transposing this feeling with a practiced old hand , kept peering into our characters for symptoms of ingratitude . We , as a matter of fact , were grateful to the point of servility . We made no demands , we had no hopes . We were content if we were permitted to enjoy the refracted rays of that solar prosperity and come sometimes in the summer afternoons to sit on the shady porch or idle through a winter morning on the wicker furniture of the sun parlor , to stare at the player piano in the music room and smell the odor of whiskey in the mahogany cabinet in the library , or to climb about the dark living room examining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruits of European travel : dusky Italian devotional groupings , heavy and lustrous as grapes , Neapolitan women carrying baskets to market , views of Venetian canals , and Tuscan harvest scenes  --  secular themes that , to the Irish-American mind , had becomep 162tinged with Catholic feeling by a regional infusion from the Pope . We asked no more from this house than the pride of being connected with it , and this was fortunate for us , since my grandmother , a great adherent of the **41;4689;TOOLONG theory of hospitality , never , so far as I can remember , offered any caller the slightest refreshment , regarding her own conversationas sufficiently wholesome and sustaining . An ugly , severe old woman with a monstrous balcony of a bosom , she officiated over certain set topics in a colorless singsong , like a priest intoning a Mass , topics to which repetition had lent a senseless solemnity : her audience with the Holy Father ; how my own father had broken with family tradition and voted the Democratic ticket ; a visit to Lourdes ; the Sacred Stairs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had climbed on her knees ; my crooked little fingers and how they meant I was a liar ; a miracle-working bone ; the importance of regular bowel movements ; the wickedness of Protestants ; the conversion of my mother to Catholicism ; and the assertion that my Protestant grandmother must certainly dye her hair . The most trivial reminiscences ( my aunt 's having hysterics in a haystack ) received from her delivery and from the piety of the context a strongly monitory flavor ; they inspired fear and guilt , and onep 163searched uncomfortably for the moral in them , as in a dark and riddling fable . Luckily , I am writing a memoir and not a work of fiction , and therefore I do not have to account for my grandmother 's unpleasing character and look for the Oedipal fixation or the traumatic experience which would give her that clinical authenticity that is nowadays so desirablein portraiture . I do not know how my grandmothergot the way she was ; I assume , from family photographs and from the inflexibility of her habits , that she was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her childhood as to , ask what was ailing Iago or look for the error in toilet-training that was responsible for Lady Macbeth . My grandmother 's sexual history , bristling with infant mortality in the usual style of her period , was robust and decisive : three tall , handsome sons grew up , and one attentive daughter . Her husband treated her kindly . She had money , many grandchildren , and religionto sustain her . White hair , glasses , soft skin , wrinkles , needlework  --  all the paraphernalia of motherlinesswere hers ; yet it was a cold , grudging , disputatious old woman who sat all day in her sunroom making tapestries from a pattern , scanning religious periodicals , and setting her iron jaw against any infraction of her ways . p 164Combativeness was , I suppose , the dominant trait in my grandmother 's nature . An aggressive churchgoer , she was quite without Christian feeling ; the mercy of the Lord Jesus had never entered her heart . Her piety was an act of war against the Protestant ascendancy . The religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditation but with fresh pretexts for anger ; articles attacking birth control , divorce , mixed marriages , Darwin , and secular education were her favorite reading . The teachings of the Church did not interest her , except as they were a rebuke to others ; " Honor thy father and thy mother , " a commandment she was no longer called upon to practice , was the one most frequently on her lips . The extermination of Protestantism , rather than spiritual perfection , was the boon she prayed for . Her mind was preoccupied with conversion , the capture of a soul for God much diverted her fancy  --  it made one less Protestantin the world . Foreign missions with their overtones of good will and social service , appealed to her less strongly ; it was not a harvest of souls that my grandmother had in mind . This pugnacity of my grandmother 's did not confine itself to sectarian enthusiasm . There was the defense of her furniture and her house against the imagined encroachmentsof visitors . With her , this was not the gentle and tremulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the safety of their possessions with a truly touching anxiety , inferring the fragility of all things from the brittleness of their old bones and hearing the crash of mortality in the perilous tinkling of a teacup . My grandmother 's sentiment was more autocratic : she hated having her chairs sat in or her lawns stepped on or the water turned on in her basins , for no reason at all except pure officiousness ; she even grudged the mailman his daily promenade up her sidewalk . Her home was a center of power , and she would not allow it to be derogatedby easy or democratic usage . Under her jealous eye , its social properties had atrophied , and it functioned in the family structure simply as a political headquarters . Family conferences were held there , consultations with the doctor and the clergy ; refractory children were brought there for a lecture or an interval of thoughttaking ; wills were read and loans negotiated and emissariesfrom the Protestant faction on state occasions received . The family had no friends , and entertaining was held to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell , as a duty on the lesser members of the organization : the daughters and daughters-in-law ( converts from the false religion ) offered up Baked Alaska on a platter , like the head of John the Baptist , while the old people sat enthroned at p 166the table , and only their digestive processes acknowledged , with rumbling , enigmatic salvoes , the festal day . Yet on one terrible occasion my grandmother had kept open house . She had accommodated us all during those fatal weeks of the influenza epidemic , when no hospitalbeds were to be had and people went about with masks or stayed shut up in their houses , and the awful fear of contagion paralyzed all services and made each man an enemy to his neighbor . One by one , we had been carried off the train  --  four children and two adults , coming from distant Puget Sound to make a new home in Minneapolis . Waving good-bye in the Seattle depot , we had not known that we had brought the flu with us into our drawing rooms , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , we had been struck down as the train proceeded eastward . We children did not understand whether the chattering of our teeth and Mama 's lying torpid in the berth were not somehow a part of the trip ( until then serious illness , in our minds , had been associated with innovations  --  it had always brought home a new baby ) , and we began to be sure that it was all an adventurewhen we saw our father draw a revolver on the conductor who was trying to put us off the train at a small wooden station in the middle of the North Dakota prairie . On the platform at Minneapolis , there were stretchers , a wheelchair , redcaps , distraught officials , and , beyondp 167them , in the crowd , my grandfather 's rosy face , cigar , and cane , my grandmother 's feathered hat , imparting an air of festivity to this strange and confused picture , making us children certain that our illness was the beginning of a delightful holiday . We awoke to reality in the sewing room several weeks later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cross nurses , and efficiency , and though we were shut out from the knowledge of what had happened so close to us , just out of our hearing  --  a scandal of the gravest character , a coming and going of priests and undertakers and coffins ( Mama , and Daddy , they assured us , had gone to get well in the hospital )  --  we became aware , even as we woke from our fevers , that everything , including ourselves , was different . We had shrunk , at it were , and faded , like the flannel pajamas we wore , which during these few weeks had grown , doubtless from the disinfectantthey were washed in , wretchedly thin and shabby . The behavior of the people around us , abrupt , careless , and preoccupied , apprised us without any ceremony of our diminished importance . Our value had paled , and a new image of ourselves  --  the image , if we had guessed it , of the orphan  --  was already forming in our minds . We had not known we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time , served to define the p 168change for us and to herald the new order . Before we got sick , we were spoiled ; that was what was the matter now , and everything we could not understand , everythingunfamiliar and displeasing , took on a certain plausibility when related to this fresh concept . We had not known what it was to have trays dumped summarily on our beds and no sugar and cream for our cereal , to take medicine in a gulp because someone could not be bothered to wait for us , to have our arms jerked into our sleeves and a comb ripped through our hair , to be bathed impatiently , to be told to sit up or lie down quick and no nonsense about it , to find our questions unansweredand our requests unheeded , to lie for hours alone and wait for the doctor 's visit , but this , so it seemed , was an oversight in our training , and my grandmother and her household applied themselves with a will to remedying the deficiency . Their motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed that we learned that the world was no longer our oyster . The happy life we had had  --  the May baskets and the valentines , the picnics in the yard , and the elaborate snowmen  --  was a poor preparation , in truth , for the future that now opened up to us . Our new instructors could hardly be blamed for a certain impatience with our parents , who had been so lacking in foresight . It was to everyone 's interest , decidedly , that we should forget the p 169past  --  the quicker , the better  --  and a steady disparagementof our habits ( " Tea and chocolate , can you imagine , and all those frosted cakes  --  no wonder poor Tess was always after the doctor " ) , praise that was rigorously comparative ( " You have absolutely no idea of the improvementin those children " ) flattered the feelings of the speakers and prepared as to accept a loss that was , in any case , irreparable . Like all children , we wished to conform , and the notion that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of them falter a little , like a child 's recitation to strangers . We no longer demanded our due , and the wish to see our parents insensibly ' weakened . Soon we ceased to speak of it , and thus , without tears or tantrums , we came to know they were dead . Why no one , least of all our grandmother , to whose repertory the subject seems so congenial , took the trouble to tell us , it is impossible now to know . It is easy to imagine her " breaking " the news to those of us who were old enough to listen in one of those official interviewsin which her nature periodically tumefied , becomingheavy and turgid , like her portentous bosom , like peonies , her favorite flower , or like the dressmaker 's dummy , that bombastic image of herself that , halfswathedin a sheet for decorum 's sake , lent a museumlike solemnity to the sewing room and aroused our first sexual p 170curiosity . The mind 's ear frames her sentences , but in reality she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ignorant and the bowels open ) , or from a mistaken kindness , it is difficult to guess . Perhaps really she feared our tears , which might rain on her like reproaches , since the family policy at the time was predicated on the axiom of our virtual insentience , an assumption that allowed them to proceed with us as if with pieces of furniture . Without explanationsor coddling , as soon as they could safely get up , my three brothers were dispatched to the other house ; they were much too young to " feel " it , I heard the grownups murmur , and would never know the difference " if Myers and Margaret were careful . " In my case , however , a doubt must have been experienced . I was six  --  old enough to " remember "  --  and this entitled me , in the family 's eyes , to greater consideration , as if this memory of mine were a lawyer who represented me in court . In deference , therefore , to my age and my supposed powers of criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to roam palely about my grandmother 's living rooms , a dangling , transitionalcreature , a frog becoming a tadpole , while my brothers , poor little polyps , were already well embedded in the structure of the new life . I did not wonder what had become of them . I believe I thought they were dead , but their fate did not greatly concern me ; my heart had p 171grown numb . I considered myself clever to have guessed the truth about my parents , like a child who proudly discoversthat there is no Santa Claus , but I would not speak of that knowledge or even react to it privately , for I wished to have nothing to do with it ; I would not cooperatein this loss . Those weeks in my grandmother 's house come back to me very obscurely , surrounded by blackness , like a mourning card : the dark well of the staircase , where I seem to have been endlessly loitering , waiting to see Mama when she would come home from the hospital , and then simply loitering with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange academy I was sent to ; the drab treatment room of the doctor 's office , where every Saturday I screamed and begged on a table while electric shocks were sent through me , for what purpose I can not conjecture . But this preferential treatment could not be accorded me forever ; it was time that I found my niche . " There is someonehere to see you "  --  the maid met me one afternoon with this announcement and a half-curious , half-knowledgeablesmile . My heart bounded ; I felt almost sick ( who else could it be but them ? ) , and she had to push me forward . But the man and woman surveying me in the sun parlor with my grandmother were strangers , two unprepossessing middle-aged people  --  a great-aunt and her husband , so it seemed  --  to whom I was now corn-p 172manded to give a hand and a smile , for , as my grandmotherremarked , Myers and Margaret had come to take me home that very afternoon to live with them , and I must not make a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents ' death was officially conceded and sentiment given its due . Concrete references to the lost ones , to their beauty , gaiety , and good manners , were naturally not welcomed by our guardians , who possessed none of these qualities themselves , but the veneration of our parents ' memory was considered an admirable exercise . Our evening prayers were lengthened to include one of our parents ' souls , and we were thought to make a pretty picture , all four of us in our pajamas with feet in them , kneeling in a neat line , our hands clasped before us , reciting the prayer for the dead . " Eternal rest grant unto them , oh Lord , and let the perpetual light shine upon them , " our thin little voices cried , but this remembrancing , so pleasurable to our guardians , was only a chore to us . We connected it with lights out , washing , all the bedtime coercions , and particularly with the adhesive tape that , to prevent mouth-breathing , was clapped upon our lips the moment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was removed , very painfully , with the help of ether , in the morning . It embarrassed us to be reminded of our parents by these persons who had superseded them and p 173who seemed to evoke their wraiths in an almost proprietarymanner , as though death , the great leveler , had brought them within their province . In the same spirit , we were taken to the cemetery to view our parents ' graves ; this , in fact , being free of charge , was a regular Sunday pastime with us , which we grew to hate as we did all recreation enforced by our guardians  --  **30;4732;TOOLONG , band concerts , parades , trips to the Old Soldiers ' Home , to the Botanical Gardens , to Minnehaha Park , where we watched other children ride on the ponies , to the Zoo , to the water tower  --  diversions that cost nothing , involved long streetcar trips or endless walking or waiting , and that had the peculiarly fatigued , dusty , proletarianized character of American municipal entertainment . The two mounds that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Civil War cannon balls and monuments to the doughboy dead ; we contemplatedthem stolidly , waiting for a sensation , but these twin grass beds , with their junior-executive headstones , elicited nothing whatever ; tired of this interminable staring , we would beg to be allowed to go play in some collateralmausoleum , where the dead at least were buried in drawers and offered some stimulus to fancy . For my grandmother , the recollection of the dead became a mode of civility that she thought proper to exercise toward us whenever , for any reason , one of us p 174came to stay at her house . The reason was almost always the same . We ( that is , my brother Kevin or I ) had run away from home . Independently of each other , this oldest of my brothers and I had evolved an identical project  --  to get ourselves placed in an orphan asylum . We had noticed the heightening of interest that mention of our parentless condition seemed always to produce in strangers , and this led us to interpret the word " asylum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain red brick building , seen once from a streetcar near the Mississippi River , as a haven of privilege and security . So , from time to time , when our lives became too painful , one of us would set forth , determined to find the red brick building and to press what we imagined was our legal claim to its protection . But sometimes we lost our way , and sometimes our courage , and after spending a day hanging about the streets peering into strange yards , trying to assess the kindheartedness of the owner ( for we also thought of adoption ) , or a cold night hiding in a church confessional box or behind some statuary in the Art Institute , we would be brought by the police , by some well-meaning householder , or simply by fear and hunger , to my grandmother 's door . There we would be silently received , and a family conclave would be summoned . We would be put to sleep in the sewing room for a night , p 175or sometimes more , until our feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at any rate , for the promise that no reprisals would be taken and that the life we had run away from would go on " as if nothing had happened . " Since we were usually running away to escape some anticipated punishment , these flights at least gained us something , but in spite of the taunts of our guardians , who congratulated us bitterly on our " cleverness , " we ourselvescould not feel that we came home in triumph so long as we came home at all . The cramps and dreads of those long nights made a harrowing impression on us . Our failure to run away successfully put us , so we thought , at the absolute mercy of our guardians ; our last weapon was gone , for it was plain to be seen that they could always bring us back and we never understood why they did not take advantage of this situation to thrash us , as they used to put it , within an inch of our lives . What intervened to save us , we could not guess  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any human motive that would prompt Omnipotence to desist . We did not suspect that these escapes brought consternation to the family circle , which had acted , so it conceived , only in our best interests , and now saw itself in danger of unmeritedobloquy . What would be the Protestant reaction ifp 176something still more dreadful were to happen ? Child suicides were not unknown , and quiet , asthmatic little Kevin had been caught with matches under the house . The family would not acknowledge error , but it conceded a certain mismanagement on Myers ' and Margaret 's part . Clearly , we might become altogether intractable if our homecoming on these occasions were not mitigated with leniency . Consequently , my grandmother kept us in a kind of neutral detention . She declined to be aware of our grievance and offered no words of comfort , but the comforts of her household acted upon us soothingly , like an automatic mother 's hand . We ate and drank contentedly ; with all her harsh views , my grandmother was a practical woman and would not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach her cook to make a lumpy mush and watery boiled potatoes , and market for turnips and parsnips and all the other vegetables we hated , in order to approximate the conditionsshe considered suitable for our characters . Humble pie could be costly , especially when cooked to order . Doubtless she did not guess how delightful these visits seemed to us once the fear of punishment had abated . Her knowledge of our own way of living was luxuriously remote . She did not visit our menage or inquire into its practices , and though hypersensitive to a squint or ap 177dental irregularity ( for she was liberal indeed with glasses and braces for the teeth , disfiguring appliances that remained the sole token of our bourgeois origin and set us off from our parochial-school mates like the caste marks of some primitive tribe ) , she appeared not to notice the darns and patches of our clothing , our raw hands and scarecrow arms , our silence and our elderly faces . She imagined us as surrounded by certain playthings she had once bestowed on us  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambulance , a toy fire engine . In my **26;4764;TOOLONG , these objects remained always in pristine condition ; years after the sand had spilled out of it and the roof had rotted away , she continued to ask tenderly after our lovely sand pile and to manifest displeasureif we declined to join in its praises . Like many egoistic people ( I have noticed this trait in myself ) , she was capable of making a handsome outlay , but the act affected her so powerfully that her generosity was still lively in her memory when its practical effects had long vanished . In the case of a brown beaver hat , which she watched me wear for four years , she was clearly blinded to its matted nap , its shapeless brim , and ragged ribbon by the vision of the price tag it had worn when new . Yet , however her mind embroidered the bare tapestry of our lives , she could not fail to perceive that we felt , dur- p 178ing these short stays with her , some difference between the two establishments , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She smiled on us quite kindly when we exclaimed over the food and the nice , warm bathrooms , with their rugs and electric heaters . What funny little creatures , to be so impressed by things that were , after all , only the ordinary amenities of life ! Seeing us content in her house , her emulative spirit warmed slowly to our admiration : she compared herself to our guardians , and though for expedientreasons she could not afford to depreciate them ( " You children have been very ungrateful for all Myers and Margaret have done for you " ) , a sense of her own finer magnanimity disposed her subtly in our favor . In the flush of these emotions , a tenderness sprang up between us . She seemed half reluctant to part with whicheverof us she had in her custody , almost as if she were experiencing a genuine pang of conscience . " Try and be good , " she would advise us when the moment for leavetakingcame , " and do n't provoke your aunt and uncle . We might have made different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider . " These manifestations of concern , these tacit admissions of our true situation , did not make us , as one might have thought , bitter against our grandparents , for whom ignorance of the facts mightp 179have served as a justification , but , on the contrary , filled us with self-complaisance  --  our sufferings were more distinguishedif someone acknowledged their existence , if we ourselves collaborated in them , as it were , loftily , by a privy arrangement , over our guardians ' heads . During these respites , the recollection of our parents formed a bond between us and our grandmother that deepened our mutual regard . Unlike our guardians or the whispering ladies who sometimes came to call on us , inspired , it seemed , by a pornographic curiosity as to the exact details of our feelings ( " Do you suppose they remember their parents ? " " Do they ever say anything ? " ) , our grandmother was quite uninterested in arousing an emotion of grief in us . " She does n't feel it at all , " I used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without censure , as if I had been a spayed cat that , in her superior foresight , she had had " attended to . " For my grandmother , the death of my parents had become , in retrospect , an eventful occasion upon which she looked back with pleasure and a certain self-satisfaction . Whenever we stayed with her , we were allowed , as a special treat , to look into the rooms they had died in , for the fact that , as she phrased it , " they died in separate rooms " had for her a significance both romantic and somehow self- p 180gratulatory , as though the separation in death of two who had loved each other in life were beautiful in itself and also reflected credit on the chatelaine of the house , who had been able to furnish two master bedrooms for the emergency . The housekeeping details of the tragedy , in fact , were to her of paramount interest . " I turned my house into a hospital , " she used to say , particularly when visitors were present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and high  --  you can hardly imagine what those girls were charging an hour . " The trays and the special cooking , the laundry and the disinfectants recalled themselves fondly to her thoughts , like items on the menu of some long-ago ball-supper , the memory of which recurred to her with a strong , possessive nostalgia . My parents had , it seemed , by dying on her premises , become in a lively sense her property , and she dispensed them to us now , little by little , with a genuine sense of bounty , just as , later on , when I returned to her a grownupyoung lady , she conceded me a diamond lavaliere of my mother 's as if the trinket were an inheritance to which she had the prior claim . But her generosity with her memories appeared to us , as children , an act of the greatest indulgence . We begged her for more of these mortuary reminiscences as we might have begged for candy , and since ordinarily we not only had no candy but were permitted no friendships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our teachers prescribed for us , and were kept in quarantine , like carriers of social contagion , among the rhubarb plants of our neglected yard , these memories doled out by our grandmother became our secret treasures ; we never spoke of them to each other but hoarded them , each against the rest , in the miserly fastnesses of our hearts . We returned , therefore , from our grandparents ' house replenished in all our faculties ; these crumbs from the rich man 's table were a banquet indeed to us . We did not even mind going back to our guardians , for we now felt superior to them , and besides , as we well knew , we had no choice . It was only by acceptingour situation as a just and unalterable arrangementthat we could be allowed to transcend it and feel ourselves united to our grandparents in a love that was the more miraculous for breeding no practical results . In this manner , our household was kept together , and my grandparents were spared the necessity of arriving at a fresh decision about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandal would break out ( for our guardians did not grow kinder in response to being run away from ) , yet we had come , at bottom , to despair of making any real change in our circumstances , and ran away hopelessly , merely to postpone punishment . And when , after five years , our Protestant grandfather , informed at last of the facts , intervened to save us , his indignation at the p 182family surprised us nearly as much as his action . We thought it only natural that grandparents should know and do nothing , for did not God in the mansions of Heaven look down upon human suffering and allow it to take its course ? p 183WERE HE LIVING today , my Protestant grandfather would be displeased to hear that the fate of his soul had once been the occasion of intense theological anxiety with the Ladies of the Sacred Heart . While his mortal part , all unaware , went about its eighteen holes of golf , its rubber of bridge before dinner at the club , his immortal part lay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict convent school set on a wooded hill quite near a piece ofp 184worthless real estate he had bought under the impression that the city was expanding in a northerly direction . A sermon delivered at the convent by an enthusiastic Jesuit had disclosed to us his danger . Up to this point , the disparityin religion between my grandfather and myself had given me no serious concern , but had seemed to me merely a variant expression of our disparity in age . The death of my parents , while it had drawn us together in many senses , including the legal one ( for I became his ward ) , had at the same time left the gulf of a generation between us , and my grandfather 's Protestantism presented itself as a natural part of the grand , granite scenery on the other side . But the Jesuit 's sermon destroyed this ordered view in a single thunderclap of doctrine . As the priest would have it , this honest and upright man , a great favorite with the Mother Superior , was condemned to eternal torment by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mohammedan , a Jew , a pagan , or the child of civilized unbelievers , a place in Limbo would have been assured him ; Cicero and Aristotle and Cyrus the Persian might have been his companions , and the harmless souls of unbaptized children might have frolickedabout his feet . But if the Jesuit were right , all baptized Protestants went straight to Hell . A good life did not count in their favor . The baptismal rite , by conferringon them God 's grace , made them also liable to His p 185organizational displeasure . That is , baptism turned them Catholic whether they liked it or not , and their persistence in the Protestant ritual was a kind of asseverated apostasy . Thus my poor grandfather , sixty years behind in his Easter duty , actually reduced his prospects of salvation every time he sat down in the Presbyterian church . The Mother Superior 's sweet frown acknowledged me , an hour after the sermon , as I curtsied , all agitation , in her office doorway . Plainly , she had been expecting me . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I were bereaved . Touched and thrilled by her powers of divination , by her firm sense of my character , I went in . It did not occur to me that Madame Maclllvra , an able administrator , must have been resignedly ticking off the names of the Protestant pupils and parents all during the concluding parts of the morning 's service . Certainly she had a faint air , when the conversation began , of depreciatingthe sermon : doctrinally , perhaps , correct , it had been wanting in delicacy ; the fiery Jesuit , a missionarycelebrity , had lived too long among the Eskimos . This disengaged attitude encouraged me to hope . Surely this lady , the highest authority I knew , could act as mediatrix between my grandfather and God ; she , a plump , middleagedMadonna , might contrive to make God see my grandfatheras a special case , outside the brutal rule of thumb laid down by the Jesuit . It was she , after all , in the con-p 186vent , from whom all exemptions flowed , who created arbitraryholidays ( called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was she who permitted us to get forbidden books from the librarian and occasionally to receive lettersunread by the convent censor . ( As a rule , all slang expressions , violations of syntax , errors of spelling , as well as improper sentiments , were blacked out of our friends ' communications , so unless we moved in a circle of young Addisons or Burkes , the letters we longed for came to us as fragments , from which the original text could only be conjectured . ) To my twelve-year-old mind , it appeared probable that Madame Maclllvra , the Mother Superior , had the power to give my grandfather conge , and I threw myself on her sympathies . It was the unjust and paradoxical nature of the Jesuit 's edict that affected me . I rebelled , as Augustine and Kierkegaard had done , against the whimsicality of God . How could it be that my grandfather , the most virtuous person I knew , whose name was a byword among his friends and colleagues for a kind of rigid and fantastic probity  --  how could it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the object of his admonition , the despair of his example  --  I , who yielded to every impulse , lied , boasted , betrayed  --  should , by virtue of regular attendance at the sacraments and the habit of easy penitence , be saved ? Madame MacIllvra 's full white brow wrinkled ; herp 187childlike blue eyes clouded . Like many headmistresses , she loved a good cry , and she clasped me to her quivering and quite feminine bosom . She understood ; she , too , momentarilyrebelled . She and my grandfather had , as a matter of fact , established a very amiable relation , in which both took pleasure . The masculine line and firmness of his character made an esthetic appeal to her , and the billowy softness and depth of the Mother Superior struck him favorably , but , above all , it was their difference in religion that salted their conversations . Each of them enjoyed , whenever they met in her straight , black-and-white little office , a sense of broadness , of enlightenment , of transcendent superiority to petty animosities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christmas for two Sisters of Charity who visited his office ; Madame Maclllvra would perhaps recall her graduate studies and Hume . They had long , liberal talks which had the tone of performances ; virtuoso feats of magnanimity were achieved on both sides . Afterward , they spoke of each other in nearly identical terms : " A very fine woman , " " A very fine man . " All this ( and possibly the suspicion that her verdict might be repeated at home ) made Madame MacIllvra 's answer slow . " Perhaps God , " she murmured at last , " in His infinite mercy . . . " Yet this formulation satisfied neither of us . God 's infinite mercy we believed in , but p 188its manifestations were problematical . Sacred history showed us that it was more likely to fall on the Good Thief or the Woman Taken in Adultery than on persons of daily virtue and regular habits , like my grandfather . Our Catholic thoughts journeyed and met in a glance of alarmed recognition . Madame Maclllvra 's eyelids flutteredat the blank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during which her lips moved ever so slightly , whether in prayer or in repetition of some halfforgottenformula , I could not tell . There were , of course , she continued smoothly , other loopholes . If he had been improperly baptized . . . a careless clergyman . . . I considered this suggestion and shook my head . My grandfather was not the kind of man who , even as an infant , would have been guilty of a slovenly baptism . It was a measure of Madame MacIllvra 's intelligence , or of her knowledge of the world , that she did not , even then , when my grandfather 's soul hung , as it were , pleadinglybetween us , suggest the obvious , the orthodox solution . It would have been ridiculous for me to try to convertmy grandfather . Indeed , as it turned out later , I might have dropped him into the pit with my innocent traps ( the religious books left open beside his cigar cutter , or " Grandpa , wo n't you take me to Mass this Sunday ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pray for him , my dear , " said Madame Maclllvra , sighing , " and I will speakp 189to Madame Barclay . The point may be open to interpretation . She may remember something in the Fathers of the Church . . . . " A few days later , Madame Maclllvra summoned me to her office . Not only Madame Barclay , the learned prefect of studies , but the librarian and even the convent chaplainhad been called in . Books had been taken down from the highest shelves ; telephone calls had been made . The Benedictine view , it seemed , differed sharply from the Dominican , but a key passage in Saint Athanasius seemed to point to my grandfather 's safety . The unbeliever , according to this generous authority , was not to be damned unless he rejected the true Church with sufficientknowledge and full consent of the will . Madame Maclllvra handed me the book , and I read the passage over . Clearly , he was saved . Sufficient knowledge he had not . The Church was foreign to him ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heathen Hiawatha , who had heard strange stories of missionaries , white men in black robes who bore a Cross . Flinging my arms about Madame Maclllvra , I blessed for the first time the insularityof my grandfather 's character , the long-jawed , shut face it turned toward ideas and customs not its own . I resolved to dismantle at once the little altar in my bedroomat home , to leave off grace before meals , elaboratep 190fasting , and all ostentatious practices of devotion , lest the light of my example shine upon him too powerfully and burn him with sufficient knowledge to a crisp . Since I was a five-day boarder , this project had no time to grow stale , and the next Sunday , at home , my grandfatherremarked on the change in me , which my feeling for the dramatic had made far from unobtrusive . " I hope , " he said in a rather stern and ironical voice , " that you are n't using the irreligious atmosphere of this house as an excuse for backsliding . There will be time enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to . " The unfairness of this rebuke delighted me . It put me solidly in the tradition of the saints and martyrs ; Our Lord had known something like it , and so had Elsie Dinsmoreat the piano . Nevertheless , I felt quite angry and slammed the door of my room behind me as I went in to sulk . I almost wished that my grandfather would die at once , so that God could furnish him with the explanation of my behavior  --  certainly he would have to wait till the next life to get it ; in this one he would only have seen in it an invasion of his personal liberties . As though to reward me for my silence , the following Wednesday brought me the happiest moment of my life . In order to understand my happiness , which might otherwiseseem perverse , the reader must yield himself to the spiritual atmosphere of the convent . If he imagines that the 191life we led behind those walls was bare , thin , cold , austere , sectarian , he will have to revise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the first place , we ate , studied , and slept in that atmosphere of intrigue , rivalry , scandal , favoritism , tyranny , and revolt that is common to all girls ' boarding schools and that makes " real " life afterward seem a long and improbable armistice , a cessation of the true anguish of activity . But above the tinkling of this girlish operetta , with its clink-clink of changing friendships , its plot of smuggled letters , notes passed from desk to desk , secrets , there sounded in the Sacred Heart Conventheavier , more solemn strains , notes of a great religiousdrama , which was also all ' passion and caprice , in which salvation was the issue and God 's rather sultanlikeand elusive favor besought , resisted , despaired of , connived for , importuned . It was the paradoxical element in Catholic doctrine that lent this drama its suspense . The Divine Despot we courted could not be bought , like a piece of merchandise , by long hours at the prie-dieu , faithful attendance at the sacraments , obedience , reverencetoward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might well turn out that the worst girl in the school , whose pretty , haughty face wore rouge and a calm , closed look that advertised even to us younger ones some secret knowledge of men , was in the dark of her heart another Mary of Egypt , the strumpet-saint in our midst . Suchp 192notions furnished a strange counterpoint to discipline ; surely the Mother Superior never could have expelled a girl without recalling , with a shade of perplexity , the profligate youth of Saint Augustine and of Saint Ignatius of Loyola . This dark-horse doctrine of salvation , with all its worldly wisdom and riddling charm , was deep in the idiom of the convent . The merest lay sister could have sustained with spiritual poise her end of a conversation on the purification through sin with Mr. Auden , Herr Kafka , or Gospodin Dostoevski ; and Madame Maclllvra , while she would have held it bad taste to bow down , like Father Zossima , before the murder in Dmitri Karamazov 's heart , would certainly have had him in for a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly intellectual women , these ladies were romantic desperadoes . They despised organizational heretics of the stamp of Luther and Calvin , but the great atheists and sinners were the heroes of the costume picturethey taught as a subject called history . Marlowe , Baudelaire  --  above all , Byron  --  glowed like terrible stars above their literature courses . Little girls of ten were reciting " The Prisoner of Chillon " and hearing stories of Claire Clairmont , Caroline Lamb , the Segatti , and the swim across the Hellespont . Even M. Voltaire enjoyed a left-handed popularity . The nuns spoke of him with hor-p 193ror and admiration mingled : " A great mind , an unconquerablespirit  --  and what fearful use they were put to . " In Rousseau , an unbuttoned , middle-class figure , they had no interest whatever . These infatuations , shared by the pupils , were brought into line with official Catholic opinion by a variety of stratagems . The more highly educated nuns spoke of the polarity of good and evil  --  did not the knowledge of evil presuppose the knowledge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Redeemer ? A simple young nun , on the other hand , who played baseball and taught arithmetic to the sixth and seventh grades , used to tell her pupils that she personally was convinced that Lord Byron in his last hours must have made an act of contrition . It was not , therefore , unusual that a line from the works of this dissipated author should have been waiting for us on the blackboard of the eighth-grade rhetoric classroom when we filed in that Wednesday morning which remains still memorable to me . " Zoe mou , sas agapo " : the words of Byron 's last assurance to the Maid of Athens stood there in Madame Barclay 's French-looking script , speaking to us of the transiency of the passions . To me , as it happened , it spoke a twice-told tale . I had read the poem before , alone in my grandfather 's library ; indeed , I knew it by heart , and I rather resented the in- p 194fringement on my private rights in it , the democratization of the poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barclay 's pointer was rapping from word to word : " My . . . life . . . I . . . love . . . you , " she sharply translated . When the pointer started back for its second trip , I retreated into hauteur and began drawing a picture of the girl who sat next to me . Suddenly the pointer cracked across my writing tablet . " You 're just like Lord Byron , brilliant but unsound . " I heard the pointer being set down and the drawing being torn crisply twice across , but I could not look up . Trembling with excitement and a kind of holy terror , I sank back in my seat . Up to this moment , I had believed shallowly , with Napoleon , that the day of one 's First Communion was the happiest day of one 's life ; now , in the glory of this sentence , I felt that petit-bourgeois notion give a sudden movement inside me and quite distinctly die . Throughout the rest of the class , I sat motionless , simulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , awe , and congratulation , as though I had suddenly been struck by a remarkable disease , or been canonized , or transfigured . Madame Barclay 's pronouncement , which I kept repeating to myselfunder my breath , had for us girls a kind of final and majestic certainty . She was the severest and most taciturn of our teachers . Her dark brows met in the middle ; her p 195skin was a pure olive ; her upper lip had a faint mustache ; she was the iron and authority of the convent . She toleratedno infractions , overlooked nothing , was utterly and obdurately fair , had no favorites ; but her rather pointed face had the marks of suffering , as though her famous discipline had scored it as harshly as one of our papers . She had a bitter and sarcastic wit , and had studied at the Sorbonne . Before this day , I had once or twice dared to say to myself that Madame Barclay liked me . Her dark , quite handsome eyes would sometimes move in my direction as her lips prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I estimated the look , weighed and measured it to store it away in my memory book of requited affections , when a stinging penalty would recall me from my dream and I could no longer be sure . Now , however , there was no doubt left . The reproof was a declaration of love as plain as the sentence on the blackboard , which shimmered slightly before my eyes . My happiness was a confused exaltation in which the fact that I was Lord Byron and the fact that I was loved by Madame Barclay , the most puzzling nun in the convent , blended in a Don Juanesque triumph . In the refectory that noon , publicity was not wanting to enrich this moment . Insatiable , I could hardly wait for the weekend , to take Madame Barclay 's words as though they had been a prize . With the generosity of affluence , p 196I spoke to myself of sharing this happiness , this honor , with my grandfather . Surely , this would make up to him for any worry or difficulty I had caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practical effect of explaining me a little to him . Phrases about my prototype rang in my head : " that unfortunate genius , " " that turbulent soul , " " that gifted and erratic nature . " My grandfather turned dark red when he heard the news . His forehead grew knotty with veins ; he swore ; he looked strange and young ; it was the first time I had ever seen him angry . Argument and explanation were useless . For my grandfather , history had interposed no distance between Lord Byron and himself . Though the incestuous poet had died forty years before my grandfather was born , the romantic perspective was lacking . That insularityof my grandfather 's that kept him intimate with morals and denied the reality of the exotic made him judge the poet as he judged himself or one of his neighbors  --  that is , on the merit of his actions . He was on the telephone at once , asking the Mother Superior in a thundering , courtroom voice what right one of her sisters had to associate his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Madame Barclay , with tight-drawn lips , told her class that she had a correction to make : Mary McCarthy did not resemble p 197Lord Byron in any particular ; she was neither brilliant , loose-living , nor unsound . The interviews between my grandfather and Madame MacIllvra came to an end . To that remarkable marriage of minds the impediment had at last been discovered . But from this time on , Madame Barclay 's marks of favor to me grew steadily more distinct , while the look of sufferingtightened on her face , till some said she had cancer ( a theory supported by the yellowness of her skin ) and some said she was being poisoned by an antipathy to the Mother Superior. p 199NEAR THE CORNER of Fourteenth Street and Fourth Avenue , there is a store called Cye Bernard . I passed it the other day on my way to the Union Square subway station . To my intense surprise , a heavy blush spread over my face and neck , and my insides contorted in that terrible grimace of shame that is generally associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hurried into the subway , my head bent so that no observer p 200should discover my secret identity , which until that moment I had forgotten myself . Now I pass this sign every day , and it is always a question whether I shall look at it or not . Usually I do , but hastily , surreptitiously , with an ineffective air of casualness , lest anybody suspect that I am crucified there on that building , hanging exposedin black script lettering to advertise bargains in men 's haberdashery . The strangest part about it is that this unknown clothier on Fourteenth Street should not only incorporate in his name the mysterious , queerly spelled nickname I was given as a child in the convent , but that he should add to this the name of my patron saint , St. Bernard of Clairvaux , whom I chose for my special protector at a time when I was suffering from the nickname . It is nearly enough to convince me that life is a system of recurrent pairs , the poison and the antidote being eternally packagedtogether by some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from my point of view , never so useful as the dog that bears his name , except in so far as he represented the contemplative , bookish element in the heavenly hierarchy , as opposed , say , to St. Martin of Tours , St. Francis Xavier or St. Aloysius of Gonzaga , who was of an ineffable purity and died young . The life of action was repellent to St. Bernard , though he engaged in it from time to time ; on the other hand , he was not a p 201true exalte  --  he was , in short , a sedentary man , and it was felt , in the convent , I think , that he was a rather odd choice for an eleven-year-old girl , the nuns themselves expressingsome faint bewilderment and concern , as older people do when a child is presented with a great array of toys and selects from among them a homely and useful object . It was marvelous , I said to myself that day on the subway , that I could have forgotten so easily . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People have asked me , now and then , whether I have ever had a nickname and I have always replied , No , it is funny but I do not seem to be the type that gets one . I have even wondered about it a little myself , asking , Why is it that I have always been Mary , world without end , Amen , feelinga faint pinch of regret and privation , as though a cake had been cut and no favor , not even the old maid 's thimble or the miser 's penny , been found in my piece . How politicalindeed is the personality , I thought . What coalitions and cabals the party in power will not make to maintain its uncertain authority ! Nothing is sacred . The past is manipulated to serve the interests of the present . For any bureaucracy , amnesia is convenient . The name of Trotsky drops out of the chapter on the revolution in the Soviet textbooks  --  what shamelessness , we say , while in the meantime our discarded selves languish in the Lubianka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , after the regime has fallen , after all interested parties are dead , when the archives are opened and the old ghosts walk , and history must be rewritten in the light of fresh discoveries . It was happening to me then , as I sat frozen in my seat , staring at the picture of Miss Subways , February 1943 , who loves New York and spends her spare time writing to her two officer-brothers in the Army and Navy . The heavy doors of the mind swung on their hinges . I was back in the convent , a pale new girl sitting in the front of the study hall next to a pretty , popular eighth-grader , whom I bored and who resented having me for a deskmate . I see myself perfectly : I am ambitious , I wish to make friends with the most exciting and powerful girls ; at the same time , I am naive , without stratagems , for I think that this project of mine will be readily accomplished , that I have only to be myself . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a social pyramid here and that I and my classmates are on the bottom . I study the disposition of stresses and strains and discover that two girls , Elinor Henehan and Mary Heinrichs , are important , and that their approval is essential to my happiness . There were a great many exquisite and fashionablelookinggirls in the convent , girls with Irish or German p 203names , who used make-up in secret , had suitors , and always seemed to be on the verge of a romantic elopement . There were also some very pretty Protestant girls , whose personal charms were enhanced for us by the exoticismof their religion  --  the nuns telling us that we should always be especially considerate of them because they were Protestants , and , so to speak , our guests , with the result that we treated them reverently , like French dolls . These two groups made up the elite of the convent ; the nuns adored them for their beauty , just as we younger girls did ; and they enjoyed far more reclame than the few serious students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mary Heinrichs fell into neither category . They were funny , lazy , dangling girls , fourteen or fifteen years old , with baritone voices , very black hair , and an insouciant attitude toward convent life . It was said that they came from east of the mountains . Elinor Henehanwas tall and bony , with horn-rimmed glasses ; Mary Heinrichs was shorter and plump . Their blue serge uniformswere always a mess , the collars and cuffs haphazardlysewn on and worn a day or so after they ought to have been sent to the laundry . They broke rules constantly , talking in study hall , giggling in chapel . Yet out of these unpromising personal materials , they had created a unique position for themselves . They werep 204the school clowns . And like all clowns they had made a shrewd bargain with life , exchanging dignity for power , and buying with servility to their betters immunity from the reprisals of their equals or inferiors . For the upper school they travestied themselves , exaggerating their own odd physical characteristics , their laziness , their eccentric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was another story : we were the performers , the school the audience , they the privileged commentators from the royal box . Now it was our foibles , our vanities , our mannerisms that were on display , and the spectacle was apparently so hilariousthat it was a continual challenge to the two girls ' self-control . They lived in a recurrent spasm of mirth . On the playground , at the dinner-table , laughter would dangerously overtake them ; one would whisper to the other and then a wordless rocking would begin , till finally faint anguished screams were heard , and the nun in charge clapped her clapper for silence . What was unnerving about this laughter  --  unnerving especially for the younger girls  --  was its general , almost abstract character . More often than not , we had no idea what it was that Elinor and Mary were laughing at . A public performance of any sort  --  a recital , a school play  --  instantly reduced them to jelly . Yet what was there about somebody 's humble and pedestrian performance of The Merry Peasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , least of all the performer . To be the butt of this kind of joke was a singularly painful experience , for you were never in a position to turn the tables , to join in the laughter at your own expense , because you could not possibly pretend to know what the joke was . Actually , as I see now , it was the intimacy of the two girls that set their standard : from the vantage point of their privateworld , anything outside seemed strange and ludicrous . It was our very existence they laughed at , as the peasant laughs at the stranger from another province . The occasions of mirth  --  a request for the salt , a trip to the dictionary in the study hall  --  were mere pretexts ; our personalities in themselves were incredible to them . At the time , however , it was very confusing . Their laughter was a kind of crazy compass that was steering the school . Nobody knew , ever , where the whirling needle would stop , and many of us lived in a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk , lest we become , if only briefly , the personification of all that was absurd , the First Cause of this cosmic mirth . Like all such inseparable friends , they delighted in nicknames , bestowing them in godlike fashion , as though by renaming their creatures they could perform a new act of creation , a secular baptism . And as at the baptismal font we had passed from being our parents ' children to being God 's children , so now we passed from God 's estate p 206to a societal trolls ' world presided over by these two unpredictable deities . They did not give nicknames to everybody . You had to have some special quality to be singled out by Elinor and Mary , but what that quality was only Elinor and Mary could tell . I saw very soon ( the beginnings of wisdom ) that I had two chances of finding an honorable place in the convent system : one was to escape being nicknamed altogether , the other was to earn for myself an appellation that , while humorous , was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole , I would have preferred the first alternative , as being less chancy . Months passed , and no notice was taken of me ; my anxiety diminished ; it seemed as though I might get my wish . They broke the news to me one night after study hall . We were filing out of the large room when Elinor stepped out of the line to speak to me . " We have got one for you , " she said . " Yes ? " I said calmly , for really ( I now saw ) I had known it all along , known that there was something about me that would inevitably appeal to these two strange girls . I stiffened up in readiness , feeling myself to be a sort of archery target : there was no doubt that they could hit me ( I was an easy mark ) , but , pray God , it be one of the larger concentric circles , not , oh Blessed Virgin , the red , tender bull's-eye at the heart . I could not have imagined what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saidp 207Elinor and began to laugh , looking at me oddly because I did not laugh too . " Si ? " I asked , puzzled . I was a new girl , it was true , but I did not come from the country . " C-Y-E , " said Elinor , spelling . " But what does it mean ? " I asked the two of them , for Mary had now caught up with her . They shook their dark heads and laughed . " Oh no , " they said . " We ca n't tell you . But it 's very , very good . Is n't it ? " they asked each other . " It 's one of our best . " I saw at once that it was useless to question them . They would never tell me , of course , and I would only make myself ridiculous , even more Cye-like , if I persisted . It occurred to me that if I showed no anxiety , they would soon forget about it , but my shrewdness was no match for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . It was called to me on the baseball field , when the young nun was at bat ; it was whispered from head to head down the long refectory table at dinner . It rang through the corridorsin the dormitory . " What does it mean ? " I would hear a girl ask . Elinor or Mary would whisper in her ear , and the girl would cast me a quick glance , and then laugh . Plainly , they had hit me off to a T , and as I saw this my curiosity overcame my fear and my resentment . I no longer cared how derogatory the name might be ; I would stand anything . I said to myself , if only I could know it . If only I had some special friend who could find out and then tell me . But I was new and a little queer , p 208anyway , it seemed ; I had no special friends , and now it was part of the joke that the whole school should know , and know that I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been obscure , was now conspicuous , and , as it were , axiomatic . Nobody could ever become my friend , because to do so would involve telling me , and Elinor and Mary would never forgive that . It was up to me to guess it , and I would lie in bed at night , guessing wildly , as though against time , like the miller 's upstart daughter in Rumpelstiltskin . Outlandish phrases would present themselves : " Catch your elbow , " " Cheat your end . " Or , on the other hand , sensible ones that were humiliating : " Clean your ears . " One night I got up and poured water into the china basin and washed my ears in the dark , but when I looked at the washcloth in the light the next morning , it was perfectly clean . And in any case , it seemed to me that the name must have some more profound meaning . My fault was nothing ordinarythat you could do something about , like washing your ears . Plainly , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I could not have told precisely what my wrongness consisted in , I felt its existence almost tangible during those nights , and knew that it had always been with me , even in the other school , where I had been popular , good at games , good at dramatics ; I had always had it , a kind of miserable efflu-p 209vium of the spirit that the ordinary sieves of report cards and weekly confessions had been powerless to catch . Now I saw that I could never , as I had hoped , belong to the convent 's inner circles , not to the tier of beauty , nor to the tier of manners and good deportment , which was signalized by wide moire ribbons , awarded once a week , blue , green , or pink , depending on one 's age , that were worn in a sort of bandolier style , crosswise from shoulder to hip . I could take my seat in the dowdy tier of scholarship , but my social acquaintance would be limited to a few frowzy little girls of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they did not even know what my nickname stood for . Even they , I thought , were better off than I , for they knew their place , they accepted the fact that they were unimportant little girls . No older girl would bother to jeer at them , but in me there was something overweening , over-eager , over-intense , that had brought upon me the hateful name . Now my only desire was to be alone , and in the convent this was difficult , for the nuns believed that solitude was appropriate for anchorites , but for growing girls , unhealthy . I went to the library a great deal and read all of Cooper , and Stoddard 's Lectures . I became passionately religious , made a retreat with a fiery missionary Jesuit , spent hours on my knees in adoration of the Blessed Sacrament , but even in the chapel , the name pursued me : glancing up atp 210the cross , I would see the initials , I.N.R.I. ; the name that had been given Christ in mockery now mocked me , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufferings were ignoble and had nothing whatever in common with God 's . And , always , there was no avoiding the communal life , the older girls passing as I crept along the corridor with a little knot of my classmates . " Hello , Cye . " Looking back , I see that if I had ever burst into tears publicly , begged for quarter , compunction would have been felt . Some goddess of the college department would have comforted me , spoken gently to Elinor and Mary , and the nickname would have been dropped . Perhaps it might even have been explained to me . But I did not cry , even alone in my room . I chose what was actually the more shameful part . I accepted the nickname , made a sort of joke of it , used it brazenly myself on the telephone , during vacations , calling up to ask a group of classmates to the movies : " This is Cye speaking . " But all the time I was making plans , writing letters home , arranging my escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convent , I would never , never , never again let anybody see what I was like . That , I felt , had been my mistake . The day I left the Mother Superior cried . " I think you will grow up to be a novelist , " she said , " and that can be a fine thing , but I want you to remember all your life the training you have had here in the convent . " p 211I was moved and thrilled by the moment , the prediction , the parting adjuration . " Yes , " I said , weeping , but I intended to forget the convent within twenty-four hours . And in this I was quite successful . The nickname followed me for a time , to the public high school I entered . One of the girls said to me , " I hear you are called Cye . " " Yes , " I replied easily . " How do youspell it ? " she asked . " S-I , " I said . " Oh , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't know why they called me that . " This version of the nickname lasted perhaps three weeks . At the end of that time , I dropped the group of girls who used it , and I never heard it again . Now , however , the question has been reopened . What do the letters stand for ? A happy solution occurred to me yesterday , on Fifteenth Street and Fourth Avenue . " Clever Young Egg , " I said to myself out loud . The words had arranged themselves without my volition , and instantlyI felt that sharp , cool sense of relief and triumph that one has on awakening from a nightmare . Could that have been it ? Is it possible that that was all ? Is it possiblethat Elinor and Mary really divined nothing , that they were paying me a sort of backhanded compliment , nothing certainly that anybody could object to ? I began to laugh at myself , affectionately , as one does after a long worry , saying , " You fool , look how silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can go back , " I thought happily , without reflection , just as though I were an absconding bank teller who had been living for years with his spiritual bags packed , waiting for the charges against him to be dropped that he might return to his native town . A vision of the study hall rose before me , with my favorite nun on the platform and the beautiful girls in their places . My heart rushed forward to embrace it . But , alas , it is too late . Elinor Henehan is dead , my favorite nun has removed to another convent , the beautiful girls are married  --  I have seen them from time to time and no longer aspire to their friendship . And as for the pale , plain girl in the front of the study hall , her , too , I can no longer reach . I see her creeping down the corridor with a little knot of her classmates . " Hello , Cye , " I say with a touch of disdain for her rawness , her guileless ambition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop a snake down her back , but unfortunately the convent discipline forbids such open brutality . I hate her , for she is my natural victim , and it is I who have given her the name , the shameful , inscrutable name that she will never , sleeplessin her bed at night , be able to puzzle out.
