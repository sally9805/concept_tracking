To the U.S. from Moscow , Paris , Bonn and London flew the man hailed in British headlines as " Supermac " and enthusiastically billed , on the way to British elections , as political leader of the free world . With each approaching mile , the blips showed more clearly that Prime Minister Harold Macmillan meant to persuade the U.S. to relax some of its basic cold-war policies . Forewarned by London press leaks and by its own intelligence from Western Europe , the U.S. was partly forearmed ; soon after Macmillan landed he was deliberately whisked away from the pressures and pressagentry temptations of Washington to the quiet of President Eisenhower 's Catoctin Mountain hideaway , Camp David . There Old Friends Eisenhower and Macmillan ( a political adviser on General Ike 's staff during the North African campaign in World War II ) explored the road to the summit . <P> The long-held U.S. attitude was that a summit conference was useless if it was nothing but a forum for propaganda ; before any summit could live up to expectations , foreign ministers should explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fresh from Moscow 's storm and sunshine , argued that Nikita Khrushchev was really the only Communist worth talking to ; Macmillan was willing to go through the motions of a foreign ministers ' conference , but he wanted to get right down to setting a summit date . At Camp David , President Eisenhower and Prime Minister Macmillan agreed 1 ) on a foreign ministers ' conference to begin on or about May 11 ( TIME , March 16 ) , and 2 ) to go to the summit late this summer . Addendum : the West will accept Polish and Czechoslovakian representatives as observers , but not , as Khrushchev had demanded , as participating delegates . Macmillan made a minor concession : no exact date was set for the summit conference . But the U.S. made a major concession : the summit conference was not made contingent on success at the foreign ministers ' talks . <P> All this looked fine to Nikita Khrushchev . Indeed , even before the Camp David decision , he had seen what was coming and , in high good humor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since taking power ( see FOREIGN NEWS ) . He told how his six-month deadline for the West to meet his Berlin demands had not really been hard and fast , and he accepted-without being formally notified-the May 11 date for the foreign ministers ' conference , probably in Geneva . But real results , he said , could only come at the summit : " Let 's put in the heavyweights . " <P> At Camp David the heavyweights of the U.S. and Britain were committed , and in the months to come their energies would be turned to working out the mechanics of the summit conference , and , far more important , their differences over such basic free-world policies as Berlin and the unification of Germany . The leaders of East and West had last met at the summit at Geneva in 1955 . Hopes were high then for an end to the cold war-and because those hopes were shattered by Soviet obduracy and Khrushchev 's hippodroming , the phony spirit of Geneva may have done more harm than good . In 1959 the U.S. moves toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harm 's being done are therefore correspondingly less-for as long as the free world stands firm on first principles .
