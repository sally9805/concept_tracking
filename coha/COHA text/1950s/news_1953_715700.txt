Bg SISTIEI 113. a ca asoc Yorac 21x4r. -5 . ST . LOUIS , Sept. ** Foster Ibiles , Secretary of State , warned the Chinese Communists today that if they desired to resume the war in Korea they could no longer count on their " privileged sanctuary " north of the Yalu River . Mr. Dulles was speaking to an enthusiastic ' audience of delegates to the national convention of the American Legion . He also asserted that the Chinese Communists should realize that a direct intervention in Indo-China " could not occur without grave consequences which might not be confined to Indo-China . " " I say this soberly in the interest I of peace and in the hope of preventing another aggressor miscalculation , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Legion delegates enthusiastically endorsed a resolution calling upon the United States to use its full military strength , including " every weapon at its disposal , " to drive the Communist forces out of Korea if the peace failed . In its series of resolutions on foreign relations , the Legion called for an amending of the United Nations Charter in 1955 to meet the needs and requirements of the present times and " correct inadequacies that have become apparent since its original drafting . " Constitutional Amendment Urged In addition to this resolution , the Legion also called for a constitutional amendment assuring that treaties , pacts , and agree . ments made on behalf of the United States would not become operative as internal law without specific legislation by Congress . Included in foreign affairs resolutions were those calling for a veto of any attempt to admit Red China to the United Nations , and for a continued assurance by the United States to the governments of Southeast Asia that this nation regards them as equals , and that this nation 's interests are motivated by a desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dulles warned the Communist nations scheduled to participate in the Korean peace talks that the United States would not permit them to prolong the conference as other Communist nea gotiators had done in other meetings . " We are always ready to negotiate in good faith , " Mr. Dulles declared . " But we expect good faith to be mutual . We shall not lend ourselves to Communist maneuvers designed to win their ends through guile . " He assured his audience that the United States would expect to withdraw from the peace conference if , after three months , no genuine progress had been made . It would , of course , be ' foolish to attempt to forecast the outcome of the Korean political conference , he continued . It ought to succeed ; // but that was not to say that it would . The United States , at least , had no secret or ulteriorl purposes . It sought only the unification of Korea under a representative form of government . In approaching this goal , he added , the details of this nation 's thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been sufficiently appreciative of the sacrifices made by France in the Indo-Chinese war , Mr. Dulles said the independence program now in the making in that nation deserved increased United States aid provided that it " will assure an effort that is vigorous and decisive . " " We want peace in Indo-China also , " he went on . " The political conference about to be held relates in the first instance to Korea . But growing out of that conference could come , if Red China wants it , an end of aggression and restoration of peace in Indo-China . The United States would welcome such a development . " Mr. Dulles also said that the United States should never shrink from its world responsibilities out of fear that it would involve scrapping American traditions and ideas . " We do not now have to be constantly taking international public opinion polls to find out what others- want and then doing what it seems will make us popular , " he said . " Popularity won that way Is shabby and fleeting . Our present duty is rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been tested and found worthy . " Delegates to the Legion cpnvention unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the action of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal , which yesterday ruled that eleven American employes of the United Nations had been illegally discharged as a result of loyalty investigations . Legion members shouted through a second section of the ' resolution calling upon United States repre- , sentatives in the United Nations to seek an immediate reversal of these findings . They also demanded that these representatives secure a revision of United Nations rules so that any American citizen found guilty of disloyalty by a court or legislative committee , or who refused to answer questions under oath concerning membership in the Communist party , would be refused reinstatement to the United Nations . As a third step , they called upon the United States representatives to refuse United States funds to pay any back salaries that might be withheld pending settlement of these cases . This resolution , along with many others on the subject of " Americanism " and on-a Legion legislative program , came during the third day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest appeals court for the United Nations , awarded seven of the eleven United Nations employees a total of $122,500 in , damages . Four others were ordered reinstated in their jobs .
