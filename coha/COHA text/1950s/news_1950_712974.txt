txt ACHESON SAYS COST OF ARMS AID PLAN IS LIKELY TO RISE Effort We Are Going to Have to Make Here and Abroad Will Be Considerable , He Says HIS VIEWS STIR CONGRESS Secretary Tells Joint Senate Hearing Program Has Been Successful in Halting Reds Text of Secretary Acheson 's testimony is on Page 2 . By C. P. TRUSSELL Special to THE NEW YORK TIMES WAMINGTON , June 2 ? Dean Acheson , Secretary of State , asserted today that the annual cost of military assistance to the North Atlantic Treaty countries might well rise above the $1,000 , - 000,000 now estimated , unless there was " a very considerable change in the international climate and actions of certain other powers . " Testifying before a joint hearing by the Senate Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees , Mr. Acheson reported great progress , backed up by great spirit and determination , in plans and moves made in a comparatively short time to build up a balanced collective defense against aggression . But he warned : " Much , of course , remains to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort of all twelve ( treaty ) partners . It is perfectly clear , however , that if the treaty members are to be able to preserve the North Atlantic area from aggression , the United States must continue with its military aid to these countries . Fund Approval Held Vital " On the other hand , if any of us let down , or slacken our efforts , the result could well be disaster . Only by forceful , concerted action along the lines which have been initiated can the countries which practice democracy preserve democracy . " The Secretary told the committeemen that it was vital for them to approve the entire $1,222,500 , - 000 requested by President Truman for operating the Mutual Defense Assistance Program through its second year and throughout the free world . Under it , besides the $1,000,000,000 for the North Atlantic area , $120,000,000 would be used in Greece and Turkey , $27 , - 500,000 in Iran , the Philippines and Korea , and $75,000,000 in the general area of China . Senator H. Alexander Smith , Republican of New Jersey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost about $1,000,000,000 a year for the North Atlantic area , or can we look forward to smaller amounts in the future ? " " Well , " Mr. Acheson said , " we are , of course , looking forward to a time when it would be lowered , but I do not think , Senator , anybody could honestly tell you now that in the immediate future it would be lowered . " In fact , I think that the most honest answer would be that in the immediate future it might be increased . The effort which we are going to have to make here and abroad is going to be considerable . No Adequate Security Force " We are a long way from having an adequate security force for the North Atlantic Treaty and I think all the members of the treaty and the United States have got to face the fact that unless there is a very considerable change in the international climate and actions of certain other powers , we have to put more , rather than less , effort into the defense field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to the program , might require " astronomical " appropriations by the United States as well as the treaty countries paying their share to the utmost of their ability . State Department spokesmen said later that Secretary Acheson had no intention of creating such a conclusion , though he did imply that costs might rise instead of diminishing . This development caused somewhat of a stir at the Catol It was recalled that Mr. ' Allman , responding to a question at his news conference yesterday , had declared that the world was closer to peace now than it had been in five years . Most of the Secretary 's testimony , however , was on the optimistic side . He cited success in Greece , through American military aid , in halting Communist guerrilla // aggression there . He indicated that this was accomplished by action " with proper measures at the proper time " and might serve as a pattern for the present and future , world . " Had this guerrilla effort not been put down , he said , " a Communist Greece , serving as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mediterranean and the Near East , would have been a threat to the entire Western Mr. Acheson asserted that continued aid to Turkey was similarly necessary . That country , he said , was at a militarily strategic spot where it had to be enabled tocontinue resistance against communism in the vital Dardanelles area . Similarly , Mr. Acheson continued , the strategic position of Iran " needs no elaboration " at a time of " constant Soviet pressure . " In the Far East , he emphasized , the people were " poor , weary and ravaged , " and while seeking security , as free people see it , were unable to appraise what lay behind Communist dogma since they lived " in misery and desperate circumstances . " Sensitive Situations Listed He reported that sensitive situations prevailed in the Philippines , Korea , Indo-China , Burma , Thailand , Malaya and. , the newly created United States of Indonesia , The $1,222,500,000 program sought to work effectively at all these points , as well as in the North Atlantic area , he said , adding : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element of support to the long struggle of free peoples to protect themselves from those who would enslave them . " Senator Smith asked whether the European and other governments receiving military aid under the program would continue in office , or whether a change in governments might disrupt the collective security plan . - Mr. Achevm replied that , as far as he kne.fv , all of the political parties concerned in possible changes in governments  --  except the Communist party  --  were in thorough accord with the Mutual Defense Assistance Program . The question arose of whether participant countries under the treaty were pledged to pay their full shares of the program . Senator William F. Knowland , Republican of California , said that at least one participant country , according to latest reports , was putting as little as 5 per cent of its national budget into military preparation . He asked for a " breakdown " of Me military efforts , country by country . Secretary Acheson said that he would supply this for the committee record . At the same time , he recalled that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program that arms expenditures by Atlantic Treaty countries most heavily damaged by war not be permitted to retard their economic recovery through defense outlays . China Area Fund Secret Senator Knowldnd also asked for a breakdown of earmarkings of the proposed fund for anti-Communist action in the general area of China . This , Mr. Acheson said , was " a secret fund , " but he added that it would be " explained satisfactorily " to the Foreign Relations Committee in closed session , Senator Alexander Wiley , Republican of Wisconsin , asked whether the State Department knew of any " disintegrating influences at work within Soviet Russia . " Mr. Acheson said that he was not qualified as a witness on that point . Senator Tom Connally , Democrat of Texas , chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , inquired as to whether Western Europe was entering the Mutual Defense Assistance ? program through " a natural desire , " or " because of ' pressure ' from the United States , " " It is not the result of American pressure , " Mr. Acheson replied , apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
