You Are There ( Sun . 6 p.m. , CBS-TV ) is another radio veteran making the switch to TV . Its basic idea : to recreate events of the past as though they are news stories of the present . Unfortunately , the show flunked its first two assignments : the 1937 destruction of the airship Hindenburg , and the 1882 killing of Jesse James . You Are There 's chief trouble is a tendency to meander instead of march to its dramatic climax . Also , its characters are too wordily aware of their place in history . The sponsor ( on alternate weeks ) : America 's Electric Light &; Power Companies . <P> Action in the Afternoon ( weekdays , 3:30 p.m. , CBS-TV ) has a permanent outdoor set : a Western cowtown built by Philadelphia 's WCAU-TV on a vacant lot . But , though the TV camera gets outdoors , it has little freedom : there are no long chases on horseback or free-for-all barroom brawls in the movie horse-opera tradition . The dialogue limps even more obviously than the camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an experiment that needs a lot more work .
