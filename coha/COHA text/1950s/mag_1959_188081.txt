" If you ca n't stand an hour of literate , intelligent conversation , then I urge you to go see your minister , your priest , your rabbi , or your psychiatrist : you are deathly sick . " The speaker was Alexander King , sometime adman , artist , editor and dope addict , who has turned the kind of anecdote-flavored coffeehouse talk that has long been familiar in his home town ( Vienna ) into a highly successful TV act . His garrulous appearances on the Jack Paar show helped boost his current bestseller , Mine Enemy Grows Older , a book of amusing , scurrilous reminiscences . His often witty , sometimes vulgar , hour-long weekly talk show on Manhattan 's WNTA-TV ( says he : " I speak foully in public and private too " ) is the latest example of a growing TV trend-conversation . <P> Network and non-network stations all over the U.S. are producing talk shows , but none has done it with the insistence of WNTA , whose bustling , baldish supervisor , Ted Cott , seems to operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomiest prophets long ago predicted : killed the art of conversation on the other side of the picture tube . <P> In addition to Monologuist King , Cott fills his Newark studios with an impressive line-up of talkers . Producer David Susskind has no time limit at all on his Sunday-night round table , Open End ( TIME , Nov. 24 ) , and it usually rambles on for two hours . Mike Wallace , the waspish interviewer of a few seasons back , conducts half-hour sessions Monday through Friday . Bishop Fulton Sheen holds forth on Tuesdays , New Jersey 's Governor on Sunday , Beauty Consultant Richard Willis Monday through Friday ; Fannie Hurst 's Showcase follows Willis . Henry Morgan snarls at his sponsors Friday evenings . Actor Martin ( The Rivalry ) Gabel presides at a limping , 1 hour discussion on Thursdays , will soon be replaced by Songsmith and Play Doctor Abe Burrows . With 33 hours of such programming every week , WTNTA devotes 40% of its air time to talk . Says Cott : " We 're trying to create a nonfiction station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes to feed them to the rest of the stations affiliated with the National Television Association ( he has already sold Bishop Sheen to N.T.A. 's Minneapolis station ) . By next week Stripper Gypsy Rose Lee will be ready with a show : " Singing , dancing and lots of chitchat . " And aging ( 59 ) Alex King , though his health is precarious , shows no signs of running down . " I 'm under constant sedation for high blood pressure , " says he . " Gandhi and St. Ignatius Loyola had high blood pressure too , and we all started with sinful lives . I 'm preparing for sainthood . "
