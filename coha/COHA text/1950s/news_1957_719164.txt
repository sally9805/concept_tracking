txt Agriculture Secretary Benson hinted he will ask Congress to abolish acreage controls on corn . " Acreage controls on corn are unsound and wo n't work , " he told a news conference . " I hope we never have to try to work with them again . " Just last week the Secretary announced Uncle Sam will pay farmers an average $1.10 a bushel  --  for corn grown in-defiance of Federal acreage restrictions . This so-called noncompliance support level compares with a minimum of $1.36 a bushel , or 77% of parity , set last fall for farmers who observed planting restrictions in the 894-county commercial corn belt . Mr. Benson said at that time non-compliance supports are needed to help prevent the collapse of grain markets now and hog markets later . When prices are low , farmers can get . more for their corn by feeding it to pigs than by selling it outright . Bente they tend to grow more pigs . The farm chief first sought changes in the corn program last year , but was rebuffed by Congress .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
