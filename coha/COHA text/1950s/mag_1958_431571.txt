 | How to Buy a Painting : For anybody who wants to start a collection ? even on a very small budget ? here are four Do 's and five Don'ts Today , America ? especially young America ? is more art conscious than ever before in history . Our museums attract more than fifty million visitors annually . Sales of books on art are at their peak . The Wall Street Journal reports that the world 's two greatest commodities are now oil and art ! What has brought about this great upswing in our appreciation of art , and particularly paintings ? Primarily , the desire for a greater knowledge of the beautiful things in life ; a better fill-in for the frequently empty leisure hours ; the growing wish of both young and old to learn more about creativity . I was never more aware of this than when , after my appearances on The $64,000 Challenge , some 5,000 letters poured in from would-be art collectors . Most of the writers wanted to know whether they could start a small collection of paintings on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question was , " Can I buy for a hundred dollars anything worth having ? " Strange as it may seem , the answer is yes . In the past year , for instance , I was amazed at what I saw while lecturing to over 250,000 young people at various universities . Many of the students brought paintings , gouaches , water colors , and prints they had purchased out of their meager allowances , and the results were genuinely impressive . What I saw proved two things . First , our American artists are doing the most exciting work in the art world today . And second , for anyone who wants to buy a painting , there 's an immense and authentic market right here in the United States , irrespective of the buyer 's tastes , his ambitions , or his budget . How can you tell a good painting from a bad one ? A good painting is one that pleases you ! That 's the first rule . The second is to remember that neither the price of a painting nor the name of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The beginning collector may find a small painting in a junk shop for a few dollars , or he may spend much more to buy a fine , signed drawing from a top dealer . Over the years , both may give him equal pleasure . This has happened to me . I value equally my Modigliani , the only " name " painting I have in my collection of 500-odd items , and my drawing by a young KoreanAmerican-Hawaiian artist named Raymond Han , a guard at New York 's Museum of Modern Art . Originally purchased for what most art lovers would call a song , my Modigliani is probably worth a tidy sum today . The Han cost little more than the price of a good print . Yet , to me , the two pictures stand side by side in their real worth ? my complete satisfaction with what I think is truly fine art . Do n't buy paintings today with an eye on their potential value tomorrow . For ( Continued on page 188 )  | the sincere collector , the profit of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying and learning from it . Women , being more practical than men , are likely to buy paintings they think will go up in price . Men , being dreamers , are likely to take their chances , and consequently show better taste in what they select , because they usually choose something they like . How does the budding art lover go about buying ? First , he must realize that his field of choice is limited by what he has to spend , and that his first acquisition may not even be an oil painting . As for price , he must be guided in this order : first , drawings and water colors ; then , gouaches ; finally , oils . You can buy modestly priced drawings even by masters of the Renaissance , but especially by artists of the eighteenth century or by the young , unknown , but fast-rising , American painters . Rembrandt 's etchings , which are among the greatest achievements in the world of art , can still be bought for around $75 and $100 . Equally modest in price are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real future -- artists such as Raymond Han , Richard Diebenkorn , William Brice , Rico LeBrun , Mark Tobey , Kenneth Callahan , Morris Graves , and Howard Warshaw . There are dozens of them , and their work can be seen in galleries throughout the nation . Water color , your next choice from a cost point of view , is a medium not presently at its peak . The masters who excelled at it ? Sargent , Winslow Homer , and the great English watercolorists ? worked mostly in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries . Still , a market in contemporary water colors does exist . Let a reputable dealer advise you . Until you can afford oil paintings , gouaches are your next best bet . In both draftsmanship and color , they satisfy the desires of many collectors . Among the names to look out for today are Ynez Johnston and William Kienbush . The gouaches of foreign artists . such as Chagall , are of course bey and average reach . for their costs start around $3,000 to $4.000 . To begin a collection on a budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : 1 . DO be careful that you know what you are buying . Do n't plunge into obscure Oriental or Egyptian art You are liable to be taken . The ages have left us many , many things , including some first-class fakes . The great fakers of the past were brilliant and have often achieved renown under their own names . But do you want to be deceived ? I don't. 2 . DO make up your mind what you like , but leave your mind free to grov .. There 's no disgrace in deciding later that an early purchase is a little too juvenile for your maturing taste . You may even be able to sell it . 3 . DO be sure you stay within your budget . You can find what you want at your price , but you must look a little longer and harder . 4 . DO be sure that you love what you buy , passionately , at least when you buy it . And some DON'TS : 1 . DO N'T be influenced by too many other people . 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other expert opinions make up your taste . 3 . DO N'T think you can impress anyone by having a great-name picture on the wall ? if the picture is secondrate . Some of the greatest painters painted bad pictures . 4 . DO N'T worry too much about being " right . " Be courageous in deciding what you want to live with , and never mind what your friends think or say . If you make a mistake , learn from it . 5 . Last and most important : Once you 've bought a picture ? DO N'T forget to look at it ! THE END
