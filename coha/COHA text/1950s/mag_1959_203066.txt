Clambering into a fishing boat in Communist Amoy one December night in 1957 , Chang Chun-sheng , a lieutenant colonel in the Red Chinese army , pointed a Mauser at the crew and ordered them to sail him the ten choppy miles to Nationalist Quemoy . There Chang , 39 , a Red soldier for 20 years , who had fought in Korea as a " volunteer " in 1951-52 , got a hero 's welcome befitting the highest-ranking Red officer ever to defect to the Nationalists . <P> The Nationalists gave Chang a special $2,000 reward , commissioned him a full colonel in their own army , made him deputy chief of staff of an antiaircraft artillery command . After all , Chang had left behind on the mainland his parents , wife and five-year-old son , and their fate was not likely to be pleasant . Any doubts the Nationalists may have had about Chang 's sincerity were easily outweighed by the propaganda value of his defection . <P> For more than a year all went well with Chang in his new life . Then last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese New Year 's celebrations . Last week word leaked out of Formosa that Colonel Chang had been unmasked as a double-agent passing secrets to the mainland . And after being told to kneel and bend his head , he had received a single bullet in the base of his skull-the classic punishment for traitors .
