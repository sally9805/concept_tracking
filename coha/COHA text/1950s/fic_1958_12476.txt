A street in Junction City , Kansas , away from the run-of-the-mill soldier shops and taverns . Stage Left we see a portion of MAMA LOU 'S house : the front porch and door , and a large oak tree . The greater portion of the stage is devoted , however , to the tattoo shop . We must be able to see the MADAM 'S work room inside the shop . It is furnished with tattoo charts , a table , chairs and stools , tattooing equipment , a folding screen . Upstage is a door leading into the MADAM 'S living quarters . Right stage is a door leading outside into the street area . Outside is a sign which reads : TATTOOING . Stage Right we see a portion of a two-story dwelling . There is a door on the ground floor . On the second level we see the window of AUSTRALIA CROWLEY 'S front room . In the distance are trees and rooftops . TIME The present .

This is a big step you 're taking and the folks around here are going to be watching you like hawks . Your marriage must be ideal . An example for the other young folks in the neighborhood .

MADAM PRECIOUS A husband and wife must be sure of each other first . After you find out that your marriage will last --  ZELMA I know our 's will last , Aunt Precious . Do n't you , Joe Sedrick ? JOE SEDRICK Um-huh . MADAM PRECIOUS That 's not the point , Zelma . People watch teenager girls when they get married -- especially in a neighborhood like this . They watch to see how quickly the family will start , so that they can say " That 's the reason they got married . " This must n't happen to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

About your moving --  JOE SEDRICK Captain Conners says he 's sure that we can get quarters on the post . MADAM PRECIOUS Let me finish , son . On post Zelma would be exposed to uncouth young tramps from all walks of life . A lot of those enlisted men marry loose women with no morals . It would be unfair to expose her to all this . I think it 's best if she continues to live here with me until you 're out of the service . p. 112 JOE SEDRICK The post could n't be any worse than this neighborhood ! MADAM PRECIOUS I 'm doing the best I can ! I know this is n't the most desirable neighborhood in Junction City , but I 'm doing the best I can . ZELMA We understand , Aunt Precious .

MADAM PRECIOUS Yes , when this boy gets out of the service . Two years is such a short time , but it 'll give me a chance to prepare myself . JOE SEDRICK Shoot ! It do n't make sense for me to get married if I have to see my wife by appointment ! MADAM PRECIOUS Are you sure that you want to marry Zelma ? You know we 're not forcing this on you . If your feelings have changed --  JOE SEDRICK I want to marry her , but I want us to be able to live our own lives . ZELMA We will , Joe Sedrick . JOE SEDRICK When ? MADAM PRECIOUS When you 're both old enough to accept responsibilities . You 'll thank me one day for this advice . Remember , do n't let people say " They had to get married ! " I 'm going out now for a bit of fresh air . Moves to front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this boy that wedding dress ! SHE exits. p. 113 JOE SEDRICK Moves to window and stands silently staring into space . There is laughter from AUSTRALIA 'S apartment . ZELMA observes HIM for a moment . Shoot !

After we 're married you 're the boss , hear . Anything you want me to do I 'll do . We can move --  JOE SEDRICK She said we could n't ! ZELMA It would be cheaper if we stayed here , but --  JOE SEDRICK Ca n't you see what they 're doin ' , Zelma ? I 'm marrying you and Madam Precious and Mama Lou and Australia ! They do n't like me anyway -- you heard ' em . I wanted to get married in April , and old Madam Precious --  I do n't think it 's so nice waiting like this ! Look how nervous I am . ZELMA Me too , but after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOE SEDRICK What baby ? We ca n't have one until she says so ! ZELMA I 'm gon na have a baby , Joe Sedrick. p. 114 JOE SEDRICK StunnedHow do you know ? ZELMA My daddy taught me all the facts of life . AUSTRALIA LaughingHoney , hush ! JOE SEDRICK Well . . . I'll. . . be . . . ZELMA I thought you 'd be real glad . JOE SEDRICK Yeah . I am , but . . . ZELMA What ? Pause . Joe Sedrick , I 've never seen you this way before . JOE SEDRICK I 'm scared , Zelma , I guess . ZELMA It 's just excitement creeping up on you . I 've been so excited I can hardly breathe ! SighsIf our baby is a girl I 'm gon na name her Stella after my mother . JOE SEDRICK I 'm gon na name him after me . Joe Sedrick , Junior . Fascinated by this idea . Joe Sedrick , Junior . Joe Sedrick , Junior ! HE beams with pride . ZELMA I like that too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wrong with people around here -- they talk too much . p. 115 JOE SEDRICK Frightened again . But what 'll folks think ? ZELMA We 're getting married , silly ! Sighs ! Ooooowwwww , Joe Sedrick , I love you , and I love my baby , and I love my wedding , and I --  JOE SEDRICK Me too ! And I do n't give a damned what nobody says . ZELMA After the wedding let 's go shopping for baby things . JOE SEDRICK What 'll we have to buy ? ZELMA Boys do n't know a thing ! You have to have diapers and dresses and booties . . . JOE SEDRICK I 'll get him a tricycle ! AUSTRALIA He was always broke , baby ! JOE SEDRICK We 'll have to be careful with money , you know . ZELMA We 'll just have to sacrifice . JOE SEDRICK Yeah . But I ai n't gon na be like my daddy ! I 'm gon na give my son everything he wants ! I do n't care how much it costs ! AUSTRALIA He went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat broke . And a woman done it to him . JOE SEDRICK Zelma ? p. 116 ZELMA Huh ? JOE SEDRICK FrightenedHave you told Madam Precious about the baby ? ZELMA No . JOE SEDRICK She 's gon na want to kill me . You heard what she said . I 'll bet she and Mama Lou 'll get together and burn me up in bed ! ZELMA Oooooowwwwwww , Joe Sedrick . JOE SEDRICK I tell you , Zelma , she do n't like young folks having babies ! ZELMA It 's none of her business . If she does n't like it , we can move . After tomorrow we 'll be grown . Wo n't anybody have to tell us what to do . JOE SEDRICK That 's what I say ! ZELMA We have responsibilites now . We have to put our heads together and plan things out . AUSTRALIA I 'm free , honey . Just like the wind ! Ai n't nothin ' that mother ca n't do . JOE SEDRICK I 've got enough money put aside in the bank to take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the army , then I 'll have to start putting my mind to thinking about what I can do . ZELMA We can do it together . JOE SEDRICK Yeah . PauseZelma , I 'm . . . I 'm just shaking . Look at my hands . p. 117 ZELMA Think about something else then . That 's what I do when I get excited . I think about my baby . Pretends SHE is holding baby . Look at him smiling , Joe Sedrick . Is n't he cute ? JOE SEDRICK Yeah . He looks just like me . ZELMA He was very nice today .

ZELMA Joe Sedrick , why 're you saying all of those things ? The TWO SOLDIERS enter from AUSTRALIA 'S and exit down the street. p. 118 AUSTRALIA In doorwayThe Last Chance 'll be closed . You 'd better run . She exits back inside her house . JOE SEDRICK Yeah . . . ZELMA Are you feeling all right , Joe Sedrick ? JOE SEDRICK Zelma . . . ZELMA Huh ? JOE SEDRICK I. . . Nothing .
