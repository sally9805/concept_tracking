Lemmie ( " Special " ) Mabaso is a twelve-year-old Johannesburg schoolboy who rarely goes to school any more . Instead , he hangs around on street corners tootling a pennywhistle . Lemmie leads his own celebrated band , the " Alexandra Junior Bright Boys , " which started out playing for coppers , by now has made three hit records and gets featured billing at Johannesburg City Hall concerts . Reason : the haunting sound of pennywhistle jazz has become the favorite music of South Africa 's slum-caged blacks-and of a great many white hipsters . <P> In the dusty streets , urchins rock to the pennywhistle 's fast kwela beat ; in shabby speakeasies , women shuffle to its slower marabi rhythm . Among natives who earn only $20 a month , pennywhistle records ( 75 apiece ) are selling at the rate of 1,000 a day . By this spring , the rage had crossed to Britain , where a song called Tom Hark became the top jukebox hit so fast that record companies have ordered a half dozen new pennywhistle tunes . Princess Margaret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon liven U.S. jukeboxes ; American jazzmen ( including Clarinetist Tony Scott , Saxophonist Bud Shank , Pianist Claude Williamson ) went to Johannesburg to learn and record the new sound . <P> <P> Originally just a child 's noisemaker , the pennywhistle is a 14-in. bit of metal tubing , drilled with six holes and flattened at one end for a mouthpiece . Though its natural range is one shrill octave , the seasoned player can squeeze out almost another octave . Like the New Orleans Negroes who once fused Dixieland from a great many different sources ( including spirituals , marches , French and Spanish dance melodies ) , the penny whistlers began by imitating bagpipers and American jazz , with the occasional addition of native rhythms . To foreign ears the simple 4/4 tempo of pennywhistle jazz may seem repetitious and childlike . To Africans living in crowded city locations , pennywhistle jazz evokes nostalgic country memories : the swaying of women at tribal weddings , the sound of ancient work songs , the wail of funeral dirges . <P> Pennywhistle lyrics have also become the urban African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , street fights and raids by the " head-bashers " ( white cops ) . Some titles convey political messages . One called Azi Khwelwa ( " We do n't ride " in Zulu ) was banned by South African officials after they learned that natives took it as an incitement to boycott Jim Crow buses . <P> Despite their success , most penny-whistlers still find the going rough . Whistle Virtuoso Fred Maphisa thinks up his tunes while driving a cab ; Spokes ( " King of the Pennywhistlers " ) Mashiyani used to make his living as a domestic servant . But young " Special " Mabaso , who has just turned out a new hit called Serope Sa Ngwanyana ( Girls ' Thighs ) , is optimistic . Says he : " We are professionals now . From now on we are not going to play so much in the streets . "
