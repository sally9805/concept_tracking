txt ALBANY , Nov. 10 ? A plan for redrawing the , I.tate 's Senate district lines and strengthening Republican chances for maintaining a safe majority in the Legislature 's upper house was made public today . The program , drafted by the Joint Legislative Committee on Reapportionment , will increase the legislative strength of fast-growing Queens and Nassau Counties While cutting the representation of the Bronx and Brooklyn . Shortly after the maps of the proposed district lines became available , the Democratic leaders here charged that the plan was " outlandish . " They said it discriminated against New York City by giving upstate areas more votes in proportion to their population . The Democrats also protested that they had not been consulted in preparing the reapportionment and were not even allowed to see the maps until this noon . The two Democratic members of the sevenman committee refused to sign the report that was submitted to the Legislature . There were strong indications that if the Republican-controlled Legislature should adopt the plan at next Tuesday 's special session , // **44;1650;TOOLONG ?

Nassau and Queens Counties , will each gain a seat , as will Onondaga County , which is centered on the City of Syracuse . The Bronx will lose a Senator . In the Assembly , where the total membership is held at 150 by the Constitution , Nassau will pick up two seats and Queens and Suffolk one each . These are , primarily G. 0 . P. areas . To make room for these increase ; there will be two less Brooklyn Assemblymen and one less from the Bronx and from Albany County  --  all generally Democratic .

The Assembly districts , each one of which must be entirely . contained by a Senate district , are drawn by the City Council in New York and by County Boards of Supervisors elsewhere . The plan for Senate reapportionment , however , sharply controls Assembly redistricting by specifying how many Assembly districts each , county shall have under the revision . The sorest point with the Democrats is Brooklyn , where the Legislature 's minority party faces the prospect that a second set of lines may be drawn to promote the election of two Republican Senators . In issuing the report , the committee chairman , Senator Pliny W. Williamson , Republican of Scarsdale , made public only one plan for Brooklyn . He noted , however , that any other member of the Legislature might introduce an alternate or supplementary bill . Under the guidance of John R. Crews , Kings County Republican leader , another map has been drawn that carves out two new districts from which his party hopes to elect Republican Senators : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moves Uptown Elsewhere in New York City , the picture runs like this : The Manhattan lines remain about the same , with six Senators still to ) , e elected . The east-west lines have been moved north a few blocks in some cases , due to a general uptown shift in population . The Bronx districts , reduced from five to four , follow the general pattern of the Congressional districts established two years ago . Richmond retains its one Senator ' and Queens is divided to gain the one new district . The three Nassau County districts would include these areas : Second District : Garden City , Rockville Centre , Valley Stream , Floral Park and Mineola . Third District : The Towns of North Hempstead and Oyster Bay , the City of Glen Cove and part of the Town of Hempstead . Fourth District : Levittown , Wantagh , Merrick , Long Beach and Hicksville .

Thirty-second District : the City of Yonkers , the Town of Greenburgh and parts of the Cities of White Plains and Mount Vernon . Upstate , virtually all of the districts north of Delaware , Greene and Columbia Counties have been shifted and renumbered . ' Although some of the changes have irritated isome Republican Senators , it is not expected that such opposition will endanger the bill . One objection has come from Senator Henry Neddo of rural Washintgon County , which is being attached to Rensselaer County . The latter contains Troy and exceeds Washintgon in population by a factor of nearly 3 to 1 . The new plan leaves Mr. Neddo in the tail end of his , new district .

The legislative ? minority leaders , Senator Francis J. Mahoney of New York and Assemblyman Eugene F.
