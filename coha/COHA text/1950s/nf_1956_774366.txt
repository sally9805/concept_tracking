txt  | commerce of goods and commodities produced in the United States under labor conditions which failed to conform to standards prescribed by Congress . The Act applied to industries engaged in commerce and also to industries engaged in the production of goods for commerce . The Act prescribed minimum wages for employees engaged in those activities and maximum hours of work . For example , the initial minimum wage was 25 cents an hour and the maximum hours of employment were 44 a week . ( By 1955 the minimum hourly wage had been increased to $1.00 and the maximum work week reduced to 40 hours . ) If an employee worked more than those hours , he was entitled to increased compensation for overtime . The Act also prescribed limitations on the use of child labor . Congress , of course , did not undertake to fasten an industrial code on American industry . It merely made a federal offense of the wilful shipment in interstate commerce of goods , " in the production of which " any employee was paid less than the minimum wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increased compensation for overtime . A like penalty was imposed on the shipment in interstate commerce of goods made by child labor . It was argued that this control over production cut deep into the reserved powers of the States , as it sought to impose the standard of living of one part of the country on another , to eliminate substandard working conditions , and to equalize economic conditions by depriving low-cost producers of the advantages they enjoyed from cheap labor . These were , indeed , the objectives of the law . Manufacture is not interstate commerce in the constitutional sense . But the great outpourings of American industrial plants move into the streams of commerce that tie the nation together into a vast network . Low-cost goods produced in areas not yet unionized compete in the interstate market with goods from high-cost areas . To stop the movement of those low-cost goods out of one State into another may deprive them of a rich market . But that might be the consequence , if the States were sovereign and not members of a federation . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once it passed its.own frontier . Absent federation , the importing State could determine whether to admit or refuse the goods ; and any reason would be a sufficient one , because of the complete command which the importing State has over its internal and external affairs . Under the American Constitution , a large measure of that control passed to the central government . After federation , the movement of goods and persons across state  | lines was a matter of national concern . Congress now sits astride the interstate trade routes . Subject to other constitutional limitations , Congress may now permit the full tide of commerce to move across the nation , bring it to a halt , allow it to proceed in trickles , or make certain that the goods that move are manufactured or mined under conditions that make for a healthy standard of living for all parts of the nation . That was the argument ; and that was in essence the view of the Court in the Darby case . " The motive and purpose of a regulation of interstate commerce are matters for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places no restriction and over which the courts are given no control . " Id. , 115 . So wrote Justice ( later Chief Justice ) Stone in 1941 for a unanimous Court . The child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act were not in litigation in the Darby case . But the decision was wholly at war with the philosophy of Hammer v. Dagenhart . And so the Dagenhart case was explicitly overruled by Darby . So it was that a case that had long been a derelict was removed from the stream of the law . The Darby case was in a sense anti-climactic , for as I have said , by that time Hammer v. Dagenhart was hardly more than a ghost . I have indicated some of the prior and subsequent decisions that conflicted with its philosophy . Another such decision , this one by a divided Court , involved a rather vital part of Roosevelt 's agricultural program . The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 provided penalties for the shipment in commerce of surplus tobacco . The Court sustained the Act ; the dissenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this new control amounted to an absolute prohibition and gave the central government effective command over agricultural production , plainly a local matter . But their voices were crying in a wilderness . Hammer v. Dagenhart was not followed . The Agricultural Adjustment Act was sustained . Mulford v. Smith , 307 U.S. 38 . The repudiation of Hammer v. Dagenhart was therefore a foregone conclusion by the time the Darby case reached the Court . Today , the Darby case is accepted and firmly established . Its doctrine is , indeed , the foundation for pervasive federal control of conditions in the factories , shops , and mines of America , if those factories , shops , and mines are producing goods and articles for shipment into the streams of interstate commerce . The broad scope given the concepts " production of goods for commerce " and " necessary to the production thereof " is illustrated by two cases under the Fair Labor Standards Act : Farmers Irrigation Co. v.  | McComb , 337 U.S. 755 , and Martino v. Michigan Window Cleaning Co. , 327 U.S. 173 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colorado corporation which owned several reservoirs and a system of canals , all in Colorado . The sole activity of the corporation was the collection , storage , and distribution of water for irrigation purposes . The employees involved were field employees ? ditch riders , lake tenders , and maintenance men ? who handled the physical operation of the irrigation facilities , and the company 's bookkeeper , who worked in the central offices in Denver , Colorado . All were held to be engaged in the production of goods for commerce . One of the most extreme cases of this type is the Martino case . The employer was a Michigan corporation engaged in washing windows , painting , and similar maintenance work . This work was done within the State of Michigan and , for the most part , on the premises of the employer 's customers . The greater part of this work was done on windows on the premises used in the production of goods for commerce . The Court held that the cleaning of the windows of industrial plants by its employees was " an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those plants . " The Court pointed out that if the work were done by employees of the industrial plants involved , they would come under the Fair Labor Standards Act , and the fact that an independent contractor was employed would not be permitted to change the result . And see Kirschbaum Co. v. Walling , 316 U.S. 517 . The reach of the power of Congress in these fields is not determined by the Commerce Clause alone . There is the Necessary and Proper Clause , contained in Article I , Section 8 , Clause 18 of the Constitution , which grants Congress power " To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers , and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States , or in any Department or Officer thereof . " The Necessary and Proper Clause has had many applications . United States v. Ferger , 250 U.S. 199 , illustrates its use . That case involved an indictment under federal law for counterfeiting or forging a bill of lading purporting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commerce in the forged bill . But that was held irrelevant . It was sufficient that the bill of lading was an instrument of interstate commerce , an important if not indispensable adjunct of it . And so a purely local act comes under federal surveillance if it is a handmaiden of interstate activity .  | The Darby case was not an isolated episode . It was , rather , part of a development on a wide front . For while the rule of Hammer v. Dagenhart was withering and the philosophy that prevailed in Darby was maturing , parallel growths in the commerce field were taking place . Thus , in 1914 , the Court gave expression to what has been known as the Shreveport doctrine , that being the name of a city in Louisiana . ) The problem arose under the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 , by which a federal agency , the Interstate Commerce Commission , was established to fix rates and to eliminate abusive practices , including discriminatory rates . See Sharfman , The Interstate Commerce Commission ( 1931 ) . One section of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage " to any person or locality . The complaint against the interstate carriers in the Shreveport case was that their rates favored local industry over out-of-state industry . These railroads ran from Louisiana to Texas . By one rail line Shreveport , Louisiana , is 40 miles from the Texas state line and 231 miles from Houston , Texas . By another carrier , Shreveport , Louisiana , is 189 miles from Dallas , Texas . Shreveport competes with both of those Texas cities for the trade of the intervening territory . The carriers fixed low rates out of Houston and Dallas to the intermediate points in Texas , and high rates to those same points out of Shreveport , Louisiana . It appeared , for example , that a rate of 60 cents carried first class traffic 160 miles eastward from Dallas , while the same rate would carry the same class of traffic only 55 miles into Texas from Shreveport , Louisiana . The rate on furniture from Dallas to Longview , Texas , 124 miles , was 24.8 cents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was 35 cents . So it was , in instance after instance , that Shreveport , Louisiana , suffered a competitive disadvantage by reason of high interstate freight rates and low intrastate freight rates . The Interstate Commerce Commission found that the discrimination gave an " undue preference and advantage " to the Texas cities , because there were no elements of cost and service that justified the difference in rates . The Commission , thereupon , ordered the carriers to desist from  | charging higher rates for carrying articles from Shreveport , Louisiana , into Texas than those charged for traffic from Dallas and Houston , respectively , for equal distances . That order could be complied with either by reducing the interstate rates from Shreveport , Louisiana , or by raising the intrastate rates to the interstate level or by lowering one and raising the other until equality was reached . The Court sustained the order in Houston &; Texas Ry. v. United States , 234 U.S. 342 . The principle announced was as follows : " ... Congress in the exercise of its paramount power may prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being used in their intrastate operations to the injury of interstate commerce . This is not to say that Congress possesses the authority to regulate the internal commerce of a State , as such , but that it does possess the power to foster and protect interstate commerce , and to take all measures necessary or appropriate to that end , although intrastate transactions of interstate carriers may thereby be controlled . " Id. , 353 . The power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to end these discriminations against interstate commerce was buttressed in 1920 by an amendment to the Act granting the Commission express authority to prescribe the intrastate rate which will remove the discrimination , even though a state commission may have established a higher or a different intrastate rate . Then started a long series of cases , involving the exercise by the federal agency of power to fix intrastate rates so as to put an end to discrimination against interstate commerce . The cases are too numerous and complex to summarize . They involve not the question of power to act but the propriety of the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some points in a State , the Court refused to sustain an order of the federal agency fixing intrastate rates for all points in the State . Wisconsin Commission v. Chicago , B. &; Q. R. Co. , 257 U.S. 563 , 579-580 . Other orders of the federal agency fixing statewide rates have likewise been held defective where the discrimination established related only to certain markets in the State . See New York v. United States , 257 U.S. 591 , 600 ; Florida v. United States , 282 . U.S. 194 . In the latter case the Court ruled , " It would be an extreme and unwarranted assumption that to protect this interstate commerce from unjust discrimination as between persons or localities , it was necessary to alter the existing rates for the transportation of logs between all points whatever within Florida . " Id. , 208 . And so the Court has been insistent that the evidence be adequate and the findings sufficiently  | definite to sustain the imposition on a State of state-wide rates by the federal agency . Interstate and intrastate commerce are often closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interstate passengers and grant each the same service and the same accommodations . The intrastate revenues have a profound effect on interstate rates . Twenty per cent of the gross freight receipts of American railroads have come from intrastate traffic and fifty per cent of the passenger receipts have come from that source . The ratio of gross intrastate revenue to interstate revenue has been about one to three . Once the intrastate rates are reduced , intrastate revenue may well fall off and an extra burden be put on the interstate phase of the business . If the railroads are to earn a fixed net return , the lower the intrastate rates , the higher the interstate rates may have to be . And so it was that Congress gave the Federal Commission authority to fix rates ? both interstate and intrastate ? that would give the carriers " a fair return " on the aggregate value of the railroad 's property , its control over the intrastate rates being restricted to the removal of undue , unreasonable , or unjust discriminations against interstate commerce . See II Sharfman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Court sustained that exertion of federal power over intrastate rates in Wisconsin Commission v. Chicago , B. &; Q. R. Co. , 257 U.S. 563 . " Congress as the dominant controller of interstate commerce may ... restrain undue limitation of the earning power of the interstate commerce system in doing state work . . . it can impose any reasonable condition on a State 's use of interstate carriers for intrastate commerce it deems necessary or desirable . " Id. , 590 . In that case Wisconsin had limited intrastate passenger rates to 2 cents a mile . The Interstate Commerce Commission , in order to make intrastate commerce pay its fair share of the operation of the railway system rendering the service , fixed a minimum for intrastate passenger fares at 3.6 cents per mile . The order was sustained as a means of " maintaining efficient regulation of interstate commerce under the paramount power of Congress . " Id. , 590 . The power of the State to fix the local rates with due regard to the minimum required by the federal agency was recognized . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days turn on the adequacy of the findings of the Interstate Commerce Commission to sustain its conclusion that new state-wide intrastate rates are necessary , if intrastate traffic is to pay its fair share of the  | cost of operating the interstate system and yield a fair return on the combined interstate and intrastate transportation service . The particularities of the records presenting those problems are too intricate and involved to present here . Many of the cases are close , as evident by the division among the Justices . North Carolina v. United States , 325 U.S. 507 , is a recent example of a state-wide rate order established by the federal agency and set aside by a divided Court . In King v. United States , 344 U.S. 254 , state-wide intrastate rates fixed by the federal agency were recently sustained by a divided Court . Perhaps the most striking application of the Shreveport doctrine has been in the field of labor relations . We long had collective bargaining in the United States . The rights of labor to act in unison and to organize the shops and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Century . But the first nation-wide application of the principle with the authority of law behind it was made by the National Labor Relations Act of 1935 . The constitutionality of that law came before the Court in 1937 , in several cases , one involving a large steel company whose plants were located in Pennsylvania . Labor Board v. Jones &; Laughlin , 301 U.S. 1 . These plants drew their supplies of coal and iron from several States and sent their products to the markets of the nation . Labor at these plants was organized ; and several of the union leaders were discharged by the company for their union activities . The 1935 Act made discharge for that reason an " unfair labor practice " and gave the National Labor Relations Board authority to deal with the matter . The Board was authorized , among other things , to order the employer who committed such an act to cease and desist from that conduct , to reinstate the wrongfully discharged worker , and to pay him for the time he would have worked but for the unlawful discharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 344 U.S. 344 ) . If the employer disobeys the Board 's order , the Board can move a federal court of appeals to enforce it . Thus the ultimate sanction of the Board 's orders is the power to commit for contempt . The Board , after hearing , entered that kind of order in the case of the steel company ; and when the company failed to comply , the Board petitioned the federal court for enforcement of the order . That court denied enforcement , holding that the order was beyond the range of federal power . The chief point in the case was not the adequacy of the findings , but the constitutionality of the Act as applied . That issue turned essentially on the phrase " affecting commerce " in ? 10 ( a ) of the Act , which  | granted the Board power " to prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice affecting commerce . " The stream of coal and iron moving to the plants of the steel company was interrupted by the manufacturing process . That interruption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal regulation , at least so far as problems involving the organization of labor within the plants were concerned . It was conceded that employees who , for example , were crews of the trains moving coal and iron from one State to another were engaged in commerce for purposes of the Act . But the plant employees were in a different constitutional category , it was claimed . The Court rejected the argument . The reach of the commerce power went beyond the category of employees actually engaged in interstate activities . It was pointed out that it is common knowledge that the stoppage of work in these steel plants by industrial strife and conflict has a serious effect on interstate commerce . The effect would not be indirect or remote ; it would be immediate and perhaps even catastrophic . For the nation has experienced strikes which , though strictly local in the sense that they implicated only shops and factories and not interstate transportation systems , have nonetheless had a paralyzing effect on the national economy . Thus the national regulation of labor practices was sustained as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor practices have such a close and intimate relation to interstate commerce as to burden or obstruct it unless controlled , the Federal Board can act . Whether the particular action does affect interstate commerce in the sense defined by Congress was left to the Board for determination , case by case . The Jones &; Laughlin decision upheld as constitutional the boundary Congress had fixed for the Board 's action and the standards and procedure prescribed for it . The extent to which the doctrine of " affecting commerce " has been developed since the Jones &; Laughlin case may be illustrated by two cases . In Labor Board v. Fainblatt , 306 U.S. 601 , the employer was engaged in processing materials into women 's sports garments . The raw materials were supplied by a New York firm , and the finished goods were shipped to that New York firm or its customers throughout the United States . The Court held that a labor dispute in the processing plant would affect commerce , because it would interrupt the transportation of materials to the processing plant and of finished goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers , it was contended  | that it was too small to have much effect on interstate commerce . The Court replied that while the firm was relatively small compared to such industrial giants as Jones and Laughlin , this factor was not controlling . " The power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce is plenary and extends to all such commerce be it great or small . " Id. , 606 . A more extreme case is Labor Board v. Denver Building Trades Council , 341 U.S. 675 . A labor organization was engaged in a strike to force the general contractor in charge of erecting a commercial building to terminate its contract with a sub-contractor who was performing electrical work on the project . The sub-contractor purchased 65 per cent of its raw materials outside of Colorado , the State where the construction work was being carried on ; and most of the merchandise it purchased in Colorado had been produced outside that State . The subcontractor performed no services outside of Colorado , though it shipped some of its products outside of that State . The Court upheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in decreasing the flow of materials into Colorado from outside the State , during the period of construction , although the building itself , when completed , might be used only for local purposes . The Court ruled that the maxim de minimis non curat lex does not require the Board to refuse jurisdiction in such cases . Id. , 685 . The concept " affecting commerce " has been the cornerstone of many federal laws enacted by Congress in the last twenty years . The National Labor Relations Act of 1935 is one . The Anti-Racketeering Act of 1934 made a felony of extortion by threats or coercion , where commerce is affected . The Holding Company Act of 1935 , which compelled simplification of public utility holding company systems and elimination of certain harmful features of such systems , also rests in part on that source of power . The Bituminous Coal Act of 1937 regulated the marketing of goal to prevent unfair methods of competition , including regulation of intrastate coal sales affecting interstate commerce . The Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 created the Civil Aeronautics Authority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included in its jurisdiction any operation or navigation of aircraft affecting commerce . The Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1938 , which provided marketing quotas and extensive regulation of agricultural production to avoid dislocations caused by farm surpluses , and the Agricultural Marketing  | Agreement Act of 1937 , which provided for regulation of marketing of milk and certain other specified agricultural commodities , also rested in part on " affecting commerce . " And the 1939 Amendment to the Federal Employers ' Liability Act established the liability of common carriers by rail to their employees who are injured in the course of their duties , where those duties affect commerce . These are a few of the recent statutes where the Congress has employed this source of power under the Commerce Clause in order to broaden its regulation over trade and commerce . The extent to which the concept " affecting commerce " has been applied is illustrated by Wickard v. Filburn , 317 U.S. 111 , a case which ' many have thought went to the outside limits of congressional power under the Commerce Clause . Under the Agricultural Adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to farmers , pursuant to a program to restrict production to the needs of the market , in order to avoid surpluses and shortages and the consequent abnormally low or high wheat prices and obstructions to commerce . Farmers could plant additional acres ; but the wheat grown on the excess acreage was called a farm marketing excess and was subjected to a penalty of a specified amount per bushel . Filburn was a farmer to whom 11.1 acres were alloted for wheat to be harvested in 1941 . He planted 23 acres , i.e. , 11.9 acres in excess of his allotment ; and he harvested from that excess acreage 239 bushels . The marketing penalty at that time was 49 cents a bushel , which in Filburn 's case amounted to a total penalty of $117.11 . He sued in the federal courts to enjoin the officials from enforcing the penalty against him . The Act defined " market " to include , in the case of wheat , " feeding ( in any form ) to poultry or livestock which , or the products of which , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so disposed of " In other words , wheat consumed on the farm and never reaching any conventional market was subject to the penalty payment if grown on excess , acreage . Wheat that was eaten by chickens or pigs or consumed by the farmer at his table was treated the same as wheat sent into the vast stream of commerce reaching the nation 's grain markets . Filburn contended that this was a regulation of production and consumption of wheat , not of commerce in wheat ; and that at best , production and consumption of wheat have only an indirect , not a direct , effect on commerce in wheat . The Court rejected that approach , saying that the economics of the problem supplied the answer to the question  | of constitutional law . The Court made plain by extended analysis that home-consumed wheat has a substantial effect on price and market conditions for wheat . That class of wheat overhangs the market and is induced by rising prices to flow into the market and check price increases . If never marketed , it supplies needs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open market . The Court concluded : " Home-grown wheat in this sense competes with wheat in commerce . The stimulation of commerce is a use of the regulatory function quite as definitely as prohibitions or restrictions thereon . This record leaves us in no doubt that Congress may properly have considered that wheat consumed on the farm where grown , if wholly outside the scheme of regulation , would have a substantial effect in defeating and obstructing its purpose to stimulate trade therein at increased prices . " Id. , 128-129 . That case , decided in 1942 , raised one of the most important questions of interpretation of the Commerce Clause the Court has faced . Divisions among the Justices distinguish the decisions in this field . But in this landmark opinion , written by the late Justice Robert H. Jackson , the Court was unanimous . It would take a volume to develop the law of restraints of trade as it has evolved in American law . Its origins , of course , go back to English law ; and its amplification in America embraces a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enacted in 1890 , the Clayton Act enacted in 1914 , the Robinson-Patman Act enacted in 1936 , and the Celler Anti-Merger Act , passed in 1950 . Much of the law in this field relates to the types and character of restraint which are outlawed . An excursion into those matters would be long and detailed . It would involve such questions as the significance of size of industrial units , merger through acquisition of assets , merger through interlocking directorates and affiliated companies , price fixing , the division of markets among competitors , the use of patents to promote monopolistic practices , boycotts , picketing , and a host of other practices . As I have indicated , these are beyond the scope of the present lecture . I think , however , that insight into the Commerce Clause and an understanding of its reach can be attained by looking at a few select cases arising under our anti-trust laws . As discussed above , United States v. Knight Co. , 156 U.S. 1 , gave the  | anti-trust laws a very restricted scope . It was decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rather easy way of building industrial empires . As noted , a New Jersey corporation engaged in refining and marketing sugar , acquired the stock of four Pennsylvania sugar corporations . The resulting combine had a virtual monopoly of the sugar refining business in the United States . The Supreme Court held that this monopoly was not banned by the Sherman Act , since the manufacture of sugar was a local , not an interstate , activity , and since the merger of these sugar companies under one ownership and control had no " direct relation " to interstate or foreign commerce . The decision was an amazing one , since it would be apparent to any housewife , buying sugar from the interstate streams pouring from these refineries , that the existence of the monopoly would have a powerful influence on the price . Certainly the economists knew what the Justices overlooked , that the price of a commodity is a great regulator of its market . The Knight case was decided in 1895 . In ten years , however , the Court was beginning to narrow its application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern Securities Co. v. United States , 193 U.S. 197 , held that a holding company that acquired control of two competing railroads , thus stifling competition between them , was illegal under the anti-trust laws , though the holding company itself did no more than hold the shares of the two roads . Intrastate activities which " directly or necessarily " operate in restraint of interstate commerce were brought within the ban of the anti-trust laws . Id. , 331 . And see Standard Oil Co. v. United States , 221 U.S. 1 , 68 ? 69 ; United Mine Workers v. Coronado Co. , 259 U.S. 344 , 408 . By 1925 , the Knight case had disappeared into the limbo and a new constitutional doctrine had taken its place . Under the new view , Congress had broad power to outlaw or control practices , whether by employers or by employees , which had an effect on interstate commerce . As stated in Coronado Co. v. United Mine Workers , 268 U.S. 295 : " The mere reduction in the supply of an article to be shipped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture or production is ordinarily an indirect and remote obstruction to that commerce . But when the intent of those unlawfully preventing the manufacture or production is shown to be to restrain or control the supply entering and moving in interstate commerce , or the price of it in interstate markets , their action is a direct violation of the Anti-Trust Act . " Id. , 310 . The modern conception of interstate business is perhaps best illus- trated by United States v. Underwriters Assn. , 322 U.S. 533 , which held that a group of fire insurance companies that combined to fix premium rates and agents ' commissions violated the anti-trust laws . The writing of a fire insurance policy ? the making of the contract ? usually is wholly a local matter , intrastate in character . It had long been assumed that the business was , therefore , beyond the reach of Congress and subject to regulation by the States only . See Paul v. Virginia , 8 Wall . 168 . But in the Underwriters case , the Supreme Court , while recognizing that the States had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , held that it was nonetheless an interstate business , subject to regulation by Congress . The modern concept of interstate commerce is shown by the Court 's description of the fire insurance business : " The modern insurance business holds a commanding position in the trade and commerce of our Nation . Built upon the sale of contracts of indemnity , it has become one of the largest and most important branches of commerce . Its total assets exceed $37,000,000,000 , or the approximate equivalent of the value of all farm lands and buildings in the United States . Its annual premium receipts exceed $6,000,000,000 , more than the average animal revenue receipts of the United States Government during the last decade . Included in the labor force of insurance are 524,000 experienced workers , almost as many as seek their livings in coal mining or automobile manufacturing . Perhaps no modern commercial enterprise directly affects so many persons in all walks of life as does the insurance business . Insurance touches the home , the family , and the occupation or the business of almost every person in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into 48 distinct territorial compartments which function in isolation from each other . Interrelationship , interdependence , and integration of activities in all the states in which they operate are practical aspects of the insurance companies ' methods of doing business . A large share of the insurance business is concentrated in a comparatively few companies located , for the most part , in the financial centers of the East . Premiums collected from policyholders in every part of the United States flow into these companies for investment . As policies become payable , checks and drafts flow back to the many states where the policyholders reside . The result is a continuous and indivisible stream of intercourse among the states composed of collections of premiums , payments of policy obligations , and the countless documents and communications which are essential to the negotiation  | and execution of policy contracts . Individual policyholders living in many different states who own policies in a single company have their separate interests blended in one assembled fund of assets upon which all are equally dependent for payment of their policies . The decisions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it insures , the premiums it charges , the investments it makes , the losses it pays ? concern not just the people of the state where the home office happens to be located . They concern people living far beyond the boundaries of that state . " Id. , 539-542 . The modern law on the character of the restraints that are banned by the anti-trust laws reflect the broad sweep of the Commerce Clause . Purely local acts may stop the interstate stream of commerce or obstruct it or reduce its volume or in some manner affect it . These acts ? if they are of the character of acts condemned ? all come under the ban . A few cases will illustrate the vast reach of the Commerce Clause under its modern construction . Mandeville Island Farms v. American Sugar Co. , 334 U.S. 219 , was a case where a group of sugar refineries , doing an interstate business , conspired to fix uniform prices to be paid to growers of sugar beets in California . These refineries were the only practical market for beets grown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price to the sugar beet farmers in California was reduced . The Court held that in an integrated industry , such as sugar refining , the stabilization of prices paid for the raw material tends to reduce competition in the finished product . " Those monopolistic effects not only deprived the beet growers of any competitive opportunity for disposing of their crops by the immediate operation of the uniform price provision ; they also tended to increase control over the quantity of sugar sold interstate .... " Id. , 242 . In other words , local price fixing had its effects throughout the entire interstate industry and had a substantial relation to competition among the members of the interstate industry . A manufacturer of tin cans , used in the packaging of food , sold its cans to two competitors in the canned food business . These competitors were engaged in interstate commerce . The manufacturer favored one of the competitors with a handsome discount not granted the other . This was held to be within the purview of the anti-trust laws , in Van Camp &; Sons v. American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the discrimination is to substantially lessen competition , and its tendency  | is to create a monopoly , in the line of interstate commerce " in which the two canned food companies compete for business . Id. , 253 . There are myriad ways in which manufacturers by their sales practices can favor one customer over another and give him an advantage in the interstate market over his competitor . One of the most involved and intricate methods of discrimination was the basing-point system of pricing used by manufacturers . It came before the Court in Corn Products Co. v. Commission , 324 U.S. 726 . This manufacturer sold glucose to makers of candies and confections . The price of glucose was computed by adding to a base price at Chicago , Illinois , the published freight tariff from Chicago to the delivery points , even though some deliveries were in fact made from factories at Kansas City , Missouri , which is several hundred miles to the west of Chicago . Candy companies located near Kansas City would thus be at a substantial disadvantage , as compared with candy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freight rate and add it to their costs and then meet in the interstate market their competitor whose business location was favored by the basing point . The evidence showed that the price system is crucial in the candy business . Customers may be diverted from one manufacturer to another by a difference in price of a small fraction of a cent per pound . The restraint of trade may touch an interstate marketing agency such as a securities exchange , a grain futures market , or a stockyard where cattle and sheep are sold . The sales and purchases in those markets are local . But those sales and purchases are mere incidents to the flow of great streams of commodities or articles of trade that pass from one State to another through central markets in Chicago , San Francisco , New Orleans , New York City , and other great trade centers . The power of Congress over the rules for trading in these markets is well established . Swift &; Co. v. United States , 196 U.S. 375 ; Stafford v. Wallace , 258 U.S. 495 ; Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The consequence of a restraint of trade may be local . For example , one person or company may acquire a monopoly of all billboards in a State , advertising goods of local merchants . Yet if instrumentalities of interstate commerce are used to promote the local monopoly , or if interstate business in articles used with the billboards , such as posters that are placed on them , is restrained , the activity falls under the ban of the anti-trust laws . Stevens Co. v. Foster &; Kleiser Co. , 311 U.S. 255 . Distilleries of liquors and wines , doing an interstate business , conspired to fix local retail prices for their products in the several States .  | The combination used interstate transactions to carry out its plan . Some retailers did not buy interstate but obtained their inventory from local wholesalers . Yet the coercion brought to bear on the wholesalers through use of the mails and other interstate agencies was held , in United States v. Frankfort Distilleries , 324 U.S. 293 , to be under the ban of the anti-trust laws , even though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one town may , through agencies of interstate commerce , use the leverage of that local monopoly as a trade weapon against his competitor in another town of the same State or in towns of another State . The fact that the end product is a series of local monopolies is unimportant , so long as the enterprise was created through interstate transactions or the monopoly sustained by them . United States v. Griffith , 334 U.S. 100 . Lorain Journal Co. v. United States , 342 U.S. 143 , involved a local newspaper publisher who refused to accept local advertising from those who advertised over a local radio station which had invaded his monopoly over mass advertising in the area . The purpose of the publisher was to destroy the broadcasting company . The publisher 's outof-state circulation amounted to a small fraction of its total business , but it published substantial quantities of national and international news , shipped to it from various parts of the world . It carried a substantial amount of national advertising from out-of-state sources . The radio station also disseminated news and other materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Court held that the conduct constituted an attempt to monopolize interstate commerce , pointing out that the distribution locally of such news and advertisements transmitted in interstate commerce for the sole purpose of profitable reproduction and distribution was an inseparable part of the flow of the interstate commerce involved . Thus , the restraint on local trade was achieved through the use of interstate mechanisms , and the provisions of the Commerce Clause and the Sherman Act applied . In United States v. International Boxing Club , 348 U.S. 236 , decided in 1955 , the Court rendered another important decision on the scope of the antitrust laws by holding that the promotion of professional boxing contests , the revenues from which were largely derived from radio , television , and motion picture rights ( involving interstate transmission ) constituted interstate commerce and was , therefore , covered by the antitrust laws . The Court , speaking through Chief Justice Warren , pointed out that the business may have interstate ramifications though a boxing match itself is a local affair .  | In sum , the reach of the Commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect on the free flow of interstate trade or commerce . It includes restraints on or monopoly of local trade effected through the use of interstate mechanisms or interstate commercial transactions . It includes discriminatory sales to purchasers who compete in interstate commerce . In other words , it includes the use of interstate activities to restrain local trade or the use of local devices to injure or impair interstate commerce . In 1954 , the Supreme Court went further and in the significant case of Moore v. Mead 's Fine Bread Co. , 348 U.S. 115 , held that the destruction of a local competitor by purely local tactics may also fall under the ban of the antitrust laws . There was a small bakery business in Santa Rosa , New Mexico , run by Moore . Mead had a bakery business in New Mexico and in Texas . Mead also sold bread in Texas from its New Mexico bakery . Mead started a price war against Moore in Santa Rosa , slashing the price of bread so low that Moore was soon driven out of business . Mead 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antitrust laws , even though all of the sales in the price war were local sales and even though no instrumentalities of interstate commerce were used to destroy Moore . The Court , after making those observations , said , " But the beneficiary is an interstate business ; the treasury used to finance the warfare is drawn from interstate , as well as local , sources which include not only respondent but also a group of interlocked companies engaged in the same line of business ; and the prices on the interstate sales , both by respondent and by the other Mead companies , are kept high while the local prices are lowered . If this method of competition were approved , the pattern for growth of monopoly would be ' simple . As long as the price warfare was strictly intrastate , interstate business could grow and expand with impunity at the expense of local merchants . The competitive advantage would then be with the interstate combines , not by reason of their skills or efficiency but because ' of their strength and ability to wage price wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses of local price-cutting campaigns . No instrumentality of interstate commerce would be used to destroy the local merchant and expand the domain of the combine . But the opportunities afforded by interstate commerce would be employed to injure local trade . Congress , as guardian of the Commerce  | Clause , certainly has power to say that those advantages shall not attach to the privilege of doing an interstate business . " Id. , 119-120 . So far as competitive practices are concerned , the Moore case is probably as far-reaching as any decision under the Commerce Clause . I note that the Indian Constitution puts on the Union List , " Regulation and development of inter-State rivers and river valleys to the extent to which such regulation and development under the control of the Union is declared by Parliament by law to be expedient in the public interest . " Article 246 , Seventh Schedule , List I , Entry 56 . I also note that ' shipping and navigation " on inland waterways " and " on tidal waters " are under the control of the central government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the power of Congress over the vast hydroelectric projects we have already built and those that are under way or planned rests largely on the Commerce Clause . I use the word " largely " because ' Congress has authority under the War Power to erect dams and hydroelectric power plants . I indicated in an early Lecture how great an arsenal the War Power is . It reaches into economic , financial , fiscal , industrial , and social affairs as well as into military matters . The War Power , as well as the Commerce Power was used in sustaining the Tennessee Valley Authority . Ashwander v. Tennessee Valley Authority , 297 U.S. 288 , 326-330 . But the main development of the law on this subject has been under the Commerce Clause . A river is a highway for travel between States ? at least it could be such , if it were navigable . Hence , as Chief Justice Marshall , speaking for the Court in Gibbons v. Ogden , 9 Wheat . 1 , 190 , held , the power of Congress under the Commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The aftermath of that holding has been profound . It first brought to the Court controversies over whether particular rivers were navigable . If a stream is navigable , the power of Congress over it is absolute . It may remove obstacles to navigation or allow them as it chooses . Pennsylvania v. The Wheeling Bridge Co. , 18 How . 421 ; South Carolina v. Georgia , 93 U.S. 4 ; United States v. Chandler-Dunbar Co. , 229 U.S. 53 . It may license structures in the navigable waters or determine who may utilize the flow of the stream for traffic or for the generation of energy . United States v. Appalachian Power Co. , 311 U.S. 377 . The test of navigability is not whether the river in its natural and  | ordinary condition may be used as a waterway . " A waterway , otherwise suitable for navigation , is not barred from that classification merely because artificial aids must make the highway suitable for use before commercial navigation may be undertaken . " Id. , 407 . Thus a stream may not in fact be navigable at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is in the federal domain . " The power of Congress over commerce is not to be hampered because of the necessity for reasonable improvements to make an interstate waterway available for traffic . " Id. , 408 . The generous scope given the power over navigation by the Court is indicated in the Appalachian Power case , which dealt with New River , a waterway running through Virginia and West Virginia . Two courts had held the river non-navigable and therefore not subject to regulation by Congress . The Court set aside those concurrent findings . The improvements that need be made , if navigation is to be practical , may be great . Yet that is no deterrent : " Of course there are difficulties in applying these views . Improvements that may be entirely reasonable in a thickly populated , highly developed , industrial region may have been entirely too costly for the same region in the ( lays of the pioneers . The changes in engineering practices or the coming of new industries with varying classes of freight may affect the type of the improvement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ navigability referred to in the cases was navigability despite the obstruction of falls , rapids , sand bars , carries or shifting currents . The plenary federal power over commerce must be able to develop with the needs of that commerce which is the reason for its existence . It can not properly he said that the federal power - over navigation is enlarged by the improvements to the waterways . It is merely that improvements make applicable to certain waterways the existing power over commerce . " Id. , 408-409 . Absence of use of the river as a waterway for a long time , or a use that was small and even inconsiderable , is not fatal : " The character of the region , its products and the difficulties or dangers of the navigation influence the regularity and extent of the use . Small traffic compared to the available commerce of the region is sufficient . Even absence of use over long periods of years , because of changed conditions , the coming of the railroad or improved highways does not affect the navigability of rivers in the constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ v. Tennessee Valley Authority , 297 U.S. 288 . The States may own the bed of the navigable waterway ; or the riparian owners may own it . That depends on state law . United States  | v. Chandler-Dunbar Co. , 229 U.S. 53 , 60 . But the running water , the flow of the stream , is in the federal domain . In the Chandler-Dunbar case , the Court said , " Ownership of a private stream wholly upon the lands of an individual is conceivable ; but that the running water in a great navigable stream is capable of private ownership is inconceivable , " Id. , 69 . This is not the place to trace the details of the development of that doctrine . At one stage the Court receded somewhat from that position . See United States v. Cress , 243 U.S. 316 . But later it reclaimed the ground lost . United States v. Chicago , M. , St. P. &; P. R. Co. , 312 U.S. 592 ; United States v. Commodore Park , 324 U.S. 386 . Today , it is settled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has dominion over the navigable streams , a dominion so complete that it is not responsible to riparian owners for engineering projects that impound water between low and high water marks or otherwise regulate its use between those marks . United States v. Commodore Park , 324 U.S. 386 . Cf. United States v. Kansas City Life Ins . Co. , 339 U.S. 799 . Congress alone has dominion over the water power inherent in the flowing stream and can exclude riparian owners from its use without compensation . United States v. Appalachian Power Co. , 311 U.S. 377 , 424 . Congress can license the use of the flowing water to private companies ; or it can provide for the exploitation of these river resources by public power projects . Congress has , indeed , done both , some of the largest hydroelectric projects being under public management . Notable in that group are Grand Coulee , McNary , and Bonneville on the Columbia , and Hoover on the Colorado . In America , as in India , hydroelectric dams are multi-purpose . They serve the ends of irrigation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems of flood control are often dominant in the engineering plans behind the American projects . Hydroelectric energy and irrigation may be a by-product . Or some other purpose may be the main one . Once the engineering scheme is hitched to the Commerce Clause , the fact that purposes will be served that could not alone be served under the Commerce Clause is not important . Oklahoma v. Atkinson Co. , 313 U.S. 508 , 533 , 534 . The broad scope of the power under the Commerce Clause is indicated by the Court 's rulings on flood control contained in Oklahoma v. Atkinson Co. , 313 U.S. 508 . The Mississippi River , running from north  | to south for 2,500 miles , is a great artery of interstate commerce . It is navigable ; so are many of its tributaries . But it has hundreds of tributaries that are not navigable . Yet if flood control of the Mississippi were to be successful , some control of the tributaries , whether navigable or non-navigable , was necessary . And so the Court ruled . " . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be essential or desirable in the interests of the navigable portions , so may the key to flood control on a navigable stream be found in whole or in part in flood control on its tributaries . " Id. , 525-526 . The power of Congress over navigable streams has evolved to a point never dreamed of , perhaps , by Chief Justice Marshall . The details of the evolution show , perhaps as well as the history of any other constitutional principle , how the changing needs of oncoming generations have their impact on law , how old precepts are put to new and greater uses , as social , economic , engineering , and political wisdom increase . One of the most significant trends in recent American history has been toward the centralization and expansion of the activities of the national government . I noted earlier how two World Wars and the federal income tax have accelerated that trend . But the complexities of the domestic economy have also substantially contributed to that development . The problems of the Twentieth Century have frequently been nationwide in character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for action by the Federal Government has , in turn , led Congress to make fuller use of the great sinews of national power contained in our Constitution . One abundant source of such power has been the Commerce Clause . The utilization of that clause has , at times , been blocked by judicially created obstacles , such as Hammer v. Dagenhart . But the barriers have , in time , been removed , as the Darby case illustrates . Today , the power of Congress to regulate the transportation of goods in interstate commerce and thereby to influence the conditions under which those goods are produced is undisputed . The Necessary and Proper Clause , coupled with the Commerce Clause , furnishes Congress with a wide latitude in choosing the appropriate means for making its regulation effective . The concept of " affecting commerce " has furnished a basis for federal regulation of many activities which , though not themselves commerce , have a substantial effect , either individually or cumulatively , upon commerce .  | Together , these doctrines have served as the basis for a host of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation to protect the rights of working men and avoid industrial strife ; agricultural controls designed to curb the farmers ' cycle of " boom and bust " ; antitrust laws to curb oppressive practices of predatory business ; laws to keep our securities markets honest and reliable ; laws to protect our transportation systems and the people who use them , to mention only a few . In addition , our vast hydroelectric projects that serve also the ends of flood control and irrigation are hitched to the Commerce Clause . There is a great distance from those huge power projects to the wheat quotas for small farms . But they and the many gradations in between are all grounded on the Commerce Clause . That short clause does , indeed , contain an arsenal of power . It has done great service in creating one nation out of many States .  | The Commerce Clause has a negative as well as a positive aspect . The Clause not only serves to augment federal authority . By its own force it also cuts down the power of a constituent State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its residual police power . That is to say , the Commerce Clause often prevents a State from legislating even where Congress has passed no statute which collides with the state law . The Commerce Clause preempts a field in which Congress , and Congress alone , can act . The Commerce Clause , in other words , creates an area of free trade . India 's system is comparable . Article 301 of her Constitution provides , " Subject to the other provisions of this Part , trade , commerce and intercourse throughout the territory of India shall be free . " The Union List ( Article 246 , List I ) sketches an exclusive domain for the central government . And , as we have seen , India 's Supremacy Clause makes the federal law supersede state law not only as respects items on the Union List but also as respects matters covered by the Concurrent List ( Article 246 , List I and III ) , i.e. , where both the federal and the state governments may legislate . See Article 254 ( 1 ) and Article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commerce Clause have grave importance .  | Each State of the United States has delegated or relinquished power that sovereigns normally enjoy . The federal government is one of limited authority , enjoying only the sovereignty expressly granted or fairly or necessarily implied . Some powers are denied the States , e.g. , the right to make treaties or coin money , pass bills of attainder , ex post facto laws , or laws impairing the obligation of contract , the right to grant titles of nobility , and the right to lay imposts or duties on imports or exports , all as specified in Article I , Section 10 . All other residual authority is retained by the constituent States , as provided in the Tenth Amendment . It is that residual authority of the States that presses for recognition in a host of Commerce Clause cases . States ' rights , i.e. , the police power , become the staging ground for opposition to the constitutionality of federal regulation . Even when the right to federal control is clear , states ' rights are used to support state legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular federal law should be narrowly construed , so as not to collide with a state law , or so as to leave room for complementary regulations of the same subject matter , by both state and federal agencies . In other words , the authority reserved to the States under the Tenth Amendment is used ( 1 ) to deny Congress authority to enact the challenged law ; or ( 2 ) to construe a federal law so it will be in harmony with complementary state legislation . The arbiter of these claims of the opposing sovereigns is the Supreme Court , which , very early in American history , undertook by its decrees to place limits upon the authority of the States ( Gibbons v. Ogden , 9 Wheat . 1 , 197 ? 209 ) and declare state laws transcending those limits unconstitutional . Brown v. Maryland , 12 Wheat . 419 . It was important , I think , that the Supreme Court undertake that role . For in a federal system there must be some referee between the conflicting claims of the national and local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state legislatures would , in the long run , prefer home industries over those that are out-of-state , establish tariff barriers , or employ other means tending to Balkanize the nation into hostile trade areas . Theoretically , Congress could perform the role of referee by legislating in reference to conflicting state laws . But there are many state laws whose impact is obscure , until a specific application is made . Then the particular interest of an individual presses for recognition . Fines or jail sentences are imposed , goods are seized , or other invasions of individual rights are suffered . The claim being justiciable in character , and the controversy being real , not  | feigned , the case is suitable for adjudication by the courts . The federal courts have taken full advantage of the opportunities thus afforded them . There have at times been protests against the judiciary assuming that power . Perhaps the most historic is Chief Justice Taney 's dissent in Pennsylvania v. The Wheeling Bridge Co. , 13 How . 518 , 579 . In that case , he maintained that where Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislate . The particular case involved a dispute over the maintenance of a bridge across a river which was in the national domain because it was a navigable stream . Taney thought that Congress , not the courts , should resolve the controversy , absent some specific grant of jurisdiction to the judiciary . He said , " In taking jurisdiction , as the law now stands , we must exercise a broad and undefinable discretion , without any certain and safe rule to guide us . And such a discretion , when men of science differ , when we are to consider the amount and value of trade , and the number of travellers on and across the stream , the interests of communities and States sometimes supposed to be conflicting , and the proper height and form of steamboat chimneys , such a discretion appears to me much more appropriately to belong to the Legislature than to the Judiciary . " Id. , 587 . That view , however , has not had many adherents in the Court . Today the federal courts entertain jurisdiction , both where a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a state law enters a field which Congress might preempt but has not yet preempted . It has sometimes been urged that the judiciary should use the Commerce Clause to strike down state legislation only where the state legislation discriminates against interstate commerce or is out of harmony with or collides with laws which Congress has enacted . See McCarroll v. Dixie Greyhound Lines , 309 U.S. 176 , 183 ? 189 ; Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona , 325 U.S. 761 , 795 ; Morgan v. Virginia , 328 U.S. 373 , 386 ? 387 . But that view has not prevailed . The Court has quite consistently performed the role of arbiter or referee , not only to resolve conflicts between state and federal enactments and to review state law under a claim of discrimination , but also to determine whether a state law obstructed commerce , burdened commerce , or entered a field where Congress alone was entitled to legislate . The entrance of the judiciary into these fields has necessarily involved it with large questions of policy . The great bulk of the work of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the balancing of local interests against national interests .  | The " exclusive " nature of the commerce power was first adumbrated by Chief Justice Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden , 9 Wheat . 1 , a case which led Dean Ribble to write in State and National Power Over Commerce ( 1937 ) , p. 47 , that " Judges legislate interstitially and the interstices were great in Marshall 's time . " What Marshall said in Gibbons v. Ogden was a dictum quite unnecessary to the actual decision of the case : " . . . when a State proceeds to regulate commerce with foreign nations , or among the several States , it is exercising the very power that is granted to Congress , and is doing the very thing which Congress is authorized to do . " Id. , 199-200 . In the Gibbons case , there was a federal law regulating the commerce in question . So the dictum in its context merely meant that when Congress was regulating a particular phase of interstate commerce , the States were precluded from exerting any control over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broader scope ; and it was soon applied . The rule emerged that even when Congress is " silent " ? that is to say , even when Congress has enacted no federal law on the subject ? the States may nevertheless be barred from any regulation of that particular subject by force of the Clause itself . Marshall 's dictum on the " exclusive " nature of the power of Congress over commerce did not , however , survive in its full vigor . By the middle of the nineteenth century it had been cut down and restricted . Cooley v. Board of Wardens , 12 How . 299 , held that the silence of Congress did not preclude all state laws that regulated interstate commerce . The rule announced in the Cooley case is the one that in general has survived to this day : " Now the power to regulate commerce , embraces a vast field , containing not only many , but exceedingly various subjects , quite unlike in their nature ; some imperatively demanding a single uniform rule , operating equally on the commerce of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject now in question , as imperatively demanding that diversity , which alone can meet the local necessities of navigation . " Id. , 319 . The state law in question was an Act of Pennsylvania requiring vessels coming from or bound to a foreign port to receive a pilot in the Delaware River . This regulation , involving as it did the use of a port with whose waters the local experts were most familiar , was deemed to be the kind that need not be uniform throughout the nation . Local regulation of pilotage , it was held , was not inconsistent with the requirements of national commerce .  | The contests over state laws that infringe on the national domain did not abate after the Cooley case . But since then , the line has been drawn between fields that need uniform regulations and fields that do not . There is one more preliminary matter that should be mentioned . The Indian Constitution contains , in Article 303 , a limitation on the powers of Parliament over commerce . That Article provides that neither Parliament nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law giving , or authorizing the giving of , any preference to one State over another , or making , or authorizing the making of , any discrimination between one State and another , unless it is necessary for the purpose of dealing with a situation arising from scarcity of goods . No such qualification of the power of Congress is contained in the United States Constitution ; and it has never been necessary to determine if such power would be implied . It was , however , early decided that Congress , not the Court , has the final say on how free of state control the channels of commerce can or should be . Thus , in Pennsylvania v. The Wheeling Bridge Co. , 13 How . 518 , a State had authorized a private company to build a bridge across the Ohio River . The Ohio , being a navigable river , is an artery of commerce over which Congress has paramount authority by virtue of the Commerce Clause . Congress had enacted no law regulating bridges over the Ohio . But the bridge in question was charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its low height . The Supreme Court eventually decided that the bridge should be abated , unless it were elevated to a specified height . Thereupon , Congress passed a law declaring the existing low bridge to be a lawful structure over the Ohio River . Once more the case reached the Supreme Court . Pennsylvania v. The Wheeling Bridge Co. , 18 How . 421 . The Court sustained the Act of Congress , saying that the power to regulate interstate commerce includes " the power to determine what shall or shall not be deemed in jadgment of law an obstruction to navigation . " Id. , 431 . This principle has been recognized over and again . It was restated in 1946 by the late Justice Rutledge in Prudential Ins . Co. v. Benjamin , 328 U.S. 408 , 434 : " The power of Congress over commerce exercised entirely without reference to coordinated action of the states is not restricted , except as the Constitution expressly provides , by any limitation which forbids it to discriminate against interstate commerce and in favor of local trade . Its plenary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibit interstate commerce , as it has done frequently and for  | a great variety of reasons . That power does not run down a one-way street or one of narrowly fixed dimensions . Congress may keep the way open , confine it broadly or closely , or close it entirely , subject only to the restrictions placed upon its authority by other constitutional provisions and the requirement that it shall not invade the domains of action reserved exclusively for the states . " The Prudential case involved an Act of Congress authorizing state regulation and taxation of the business of insurance . This Act was passed on the heels of United States v. Underwriters Assn. , 322 U.S. 533 , which held that the modern business of insurance , as conducted in the United States , was a business in commerce within the meaning of the antitrust laws . Following the passage of the Act of Congress authorizing state regulation and taxation of the insurance business , one State sought to exact from a foreign insurance company a tax not exacted from her domestic companies . Absent any acquiescence or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Welton v. Missouri , 91 U.S. 275 , and a long line of subsequent cases made clear . For , as I will develop later , the Court has consistently struck down state taxes that discriminate against interstate commerce in favor of local commerce , even where Congress has not legislated on the matter . But once Congress has spoken under the Commerce Clause , its word is final , save as its action may violate some other constitutional guarantee . To a degree , the power of Congress to restrict interstate or foreign commerce is comparable to the power of Parliament under Article 302 of the Indian Constitution , which provides : " Parliament may by law impose such restrictions on the freedom of trade , commerce or intercourse between one State and another or within any part of the territory of India as may be required in the public interest . " The national policy , as formulated by Congress , may constitutionally bar all interstate commerce , allow it only under prescribed conditions , or permit the States to favor their local industries by making invidious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save as it is curtailed by specific constitutional prohibitions . In short , when Congress has acted , the Court determines the meaning of the federal law . When Congress has not acted , the Court decides whether a particular state regulation is consistent with the area of free trade carved out by the Commerce Clause itself .  | Congress , when it legislates on a matter of national concern , may specifically provide that the federal law shall not abrogate or nullify any state law dealing with the same subject . Such was the case in Hartford Indemnity Co. v. Illinois , 298 U.S. 155 , where both the federal government and the State of Illinois regulated those engaged in the commission business handling farm produce . Both laws accordingly were given effect . For as I have said earlier , Congress can sanction a multiplicity of regulations over interstate or foreign commerce or bar any whatsoever . Federal regulation of a subject matter may be partial only , leaving untouched one or more phases of the business or activity to which complementary state law is sought to be applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kelly v. Washington , 302 U.S. 1 , and South Carolina Highway Department v. Barnwell Bros. , 303 U.S. 177 . It appeared in the Kelly case that Congress had provided for the inspection of certain classes of boats plying the navigable waters of the nation , but had riot extended the inspection to vessels of other types and classes . The State of Washington invoked its inspection laws as respects the latter kind of vessels , and was sustained by the Court . The Barnwell case involved the constitutionality of a South Carolina law , prohibiting on the highways of that State motor trucks and trailers wider than 90 inches and heavier than 20,000 pounds . A federal law regulated interstate trucks , requiring of operators certificates of convenience and necessity that defined their routes and specified the commodities they might carry . But the federal law contained no specifications concerning the size and weight of the trucks used in these interstate movements . South Carolina was , therefore , permitted to determine the specifications for the trucks that traveled her highways . See Maurer v. Hamilton , 309 U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Congress in the interests of uniformity could establish standards and designs for the structure and equipment of vessels and the States could not enter that field , inspection was different . It held that a State has as legitimate an interest in controlling unsafe vessels , as it would have in safeguarding the public against diseased animals or unwholesome food . Safety is an intensely local affair , a matter deep rooted in the police power . In the Barnwell case , safety was also a dominant consideration in sustain- ing the local law . Size and weight of motor vehicles have an important relation to safety . They have , moreover , an immediate bearing on one of the most historic functions of municipal government ? the design , construction , and maintenance of roads . It has often been said that a state law can not survive a federal law , if Congress has " occupied the field . " That concept has little utility in analyzing the cases , for crucial questions remain as to what " the field " is and what " occupies " means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two regulatory schemes ? state and federal ? to determine if the two can live comfortably together without clash or inconsistency and , if they can , whether it was the design of Congress that they do so . If , as in the Kelly and Barnwell cases , the state law touches on phases or aspects of a business that the federal law leaves unregulated , the modern tendency is to let the state law survive , meshing it with the federal law , the two functioning as parts of an harmonious whole . The cases are almost myriad and too numerous even to list . I will mention only a few that are illustrative : In Merchants Exchange v. Missouri , 248 U.S. 365 , a state law regulated the weighing of grain , while a federal law merely established standards of quality of grain . The state law survived . Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Norwood , 283 U.S. 249 upheld a state law regulating the number of brakemen on interstate trains , since the Interstate Commerce Act ? the federal law ? while regulating many phases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for interstate trains . In Dickson v. Uhlmann Grain Co. , 288 U.S. 188 , Congress had regulated trading in grain futures . Missouri went further and made that activity illegal when it was sheer gambling and performed no market function . The Court upheld the state law , as not in conflict with the federal policy . Though Congress has regulated labor relations in the interstate field , not all state laws touching that field have been superseded . Thus , room has been left for state regulation of picketing , since Congress did not legislate concerning it . See Allen Bradley Local v. Board , 315 U.S. 740 . Though the federal Labor Board was given power to forbid a strike when the purpose of the strike was illegal under federal law , it was given no power to forbid one because the method of conducting the strike was illegal . A union adopted a plan of rather frequent work stoppages , made necessary by the calling of union meetings . This practice was held to be within the power of Wisconsin to regulate , even  | in face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this Act shall be construed so as to interfere with or impede or diminish in any way the right to strike . " International Union v. Board , 336 U.S. 245 . In the same vein is a case which allowed an employer to sue a union under Virginia law for damages for tortious conduct during a period when an attempt was being made to unionize the employer 's construction crews . The pressure of the union was so strong that the employer had to abandon its projects . The acts of the union were an unfair labor practice under the federal statute , which the federal Labor Board could enjoin . Therefore a state board or state court could not enjoin the conduct , as Garner v. Teamsters Union , 346 U.S. 485 had held . But a suit for damages for the tortious conduct was held to be different . Congress had not prescribed any such remedy ; the remedy afforded by the State was private , not public , in nature ; remedies for tortious conduct are historic aspects of the police power of the States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive the federal law ( United Workers v. Laburnum Corp. , 347 U.S. 656 ) , against the claim of the dissenters that the maintenance of the suit for damages might well rob the federal administrative remedy of the healing effects it was intended to have . These labor cases indicate the extreme tolerance of the Court for state laws that supplement federal laws , and the reluctance of the Court to strike down a state law even where the subject matter is one that Congress has painstakingly regulated . The Court has gone far in that direction ? too far in my opinion , as many dissents have indicated . There are other recent examples of this trend : A natural gas pipeline doing an interstate business must get a certificate of convenience and necessity from the Federal Power Commission in order to pipe gas across state lines . The federal Commission , however , regulates only the price of sales of gas for resale , not the price of sales made direct to industrial consumers . State regulation of the price of industrial sales would therefore be permissible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Panhandle Co. v. Michigan Commission , 341 U.S. 329 , that an interstate pipeline company could be required to get a certificate of convenience and necessity from Michigan in order to make industrial sales in Michigan , that Michigan constitutionally could say that a certificate obtained from the federal agency was not sufficient . In Buck v. California , 343 U.S. 99 , California was permitted to exact  | a permit from a carrier engaged in foreign commerce ( with Mexico ) , in spite of the fact that federal law regulated carriers doing such business . But since the federal regulations established mere minimum standards and the state standards were not inconsistent with them , the state system of regulation was allowed to be superimposed on the federal system . Perhaps the most extreme case of this type is California v. Zook , 336 U.S. 725 . Federal law required a permit from a federal agency for a person to operate a travel bureau arranging transportation in foreign or interstate commerce . California made the violation of the federal regulation a violation of state law also . The Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that prosecution under both statutes would often result in greater punishment than the maximum permitted by the federal law . The seriousness of that claim is emphasized by the fact that the defense of double jeopardy does not bar a federal prosecution for the precise act that a State has previously punished . See United States v. Lanza , 260 U.S. 377 . Therefore , overlapping statutes of the kind involved in the Zook case are usually read so as to avoid two punishments for one act . See Jerome v. United States , 318 U.S. 101 . Yet in the Zook case , the traditional interest of the State in this field was so strong and the manner in which the state law buttressed federal enforcement so plain , that a majority of the Court allowed the state law to stand . Certain phases of a state law often collide with the federal policy . Two recent examples in the labor field illustrate the problem . In Hill v. Florida , 325 U.S. 538 , the Court struck down a Florida law regulating a union 's choice of a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of workers in the selection of their bargaining representatives guaranteed by a federal Act . Amalgamated Assoc. v. Board , 340 U.S. 383 , invalidated a Wisconsin law providing for compulsory arbitration of labor disputes in public utilities , since this conflicted with the right of the employees to strike , which had been expressly safeguarded by the federal Act . The conflict between federal and state policy may be less explicit . The failure of the federal administrative agency to act may indicate , as clearly and plainly as any affirmative action , not the absence of power , but a decision that a particular practice contravenes the federal policy . Thus it appeared in Bethlehem Co. v. Board , 330 U.S. 767 , that the federal agency had treated foremen 's unions as inappropriate collective bargaining units under the federal Act . New York was therefore not  | allowed to sanction those unions in industries subject to the federal law . Rice v. Santa Fe Elevator Corp. , 331 U.S. 218 , illustrates how Congress may act so unequivocally as to make clear that it desires no regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that case , the federal law was held to supersede a law of Illinois regulating the storage of grain , as to those particular phases of the business on which Congress had legislated , even though the federal regulation was not inconsistent with the state regulation . For example , Illinois fixed warehouse rates , while the federal law did not . The federal policy on rates was not fixing them , but controlling them through the issuance , suspension , or revocation of licenses . The purpose of Congress to make the federal scheme exclusive was divined from the circumstances surrounding the adoption of the federal law and its explicit legislative history . Cloverleaf Co. v. Patterson , 315 U.S. 148 , illustrates how preemption by a federal Act may sometimes be inferred from the nature of the legislative problem . That decision struck down an Alabama statute regulating renovated butter , because of the nature of the federal Act which regulated the manufacture and transportation of that kind of butter . State confiscation of butter that had passed federal scrutiny but fell short of the state standards was thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state remedy was in a sense only ancillary to federal control . An even clearer example , taken from another field , is Hines v. Davidowitz , 312 U.S. 52 . That case involved an alien registration Act of Pennsylvania . Congress had also passed an alien registration Act . Though the two Acts might , as a practical matter , have been administered so as to be wholly compatible , the state law was struck down . Congress , it was held , had prescribed the method of registration that was consistent with the national and international interests of the United States ; the treatment of aliens often involves delicate problems of foreign relations ; and the federal government alone is responsible for the conduct of foreign affairs . Therefore it was important to have a single regulatory scheme for aliens , and that one , the federal system . Of the same tenor were the earlier Passenger Cases , 7 How . 283 , where New York and Massachusetts sought to collect head taxes for each alien landed in the ports of those States from ships coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for inspecting the newly arrived boats and passengers , as a safeguard against disease and as a means of providing some security to the States against the influx of  | paupers who might become public charges . These defenses were rejected by a majority of the Court . Congress , in providing for immigration to America , had prescribed no entrance fees for the new arrivals and by its " silence " had therefore willed that this foreign commerce be " free . " This summary account of the instances where both the federal and state governments legislate on a subject matter in the field of interstate or foreign commerce illustrates one of the perplexities of federalism . The cases show the delicacy of the task of the judiciary in balancing the national interests with the local interests and , if possible , in reconciling them by allowing the two statutes to mesh and function together . The task is difficult and delicate . It is to determine whether the purpose of Congress is to displace all local regulation . If such purpose is not evident , does the scheme of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation ? May the two systems in fact function together or is conflict inherent or likely ? These are large considerations that affect the very essence of our federalism . They involve controversial issues on which the Justices commonly divide . The difficulty and closeness of the decisions are indicated by the fact that the decisions are rarely unanimous . The dictum of Marshall in Gibbons v. Ogden , as qualified by the Cooley case , that the Commerce Clause of its own force bars action by the States , that hence even when Congress has not legislated on the matter , the States may be foreclosed , has had wide and varied application . Even when Congress is silent , the Commerce Clause creates a large area of free trade , of which the Court is often the main guardian . ( 1 ) Embargoes. ? There is , first , the case where a State seeks to set up an embargo against the importation of certain goods or against the export of articles or commodities . Protection of local trade and industry has long been one aspect of sovereignty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy in the days preceding the Constitution . The autarchy of the States often went to extreme limits . Tariff and trade barriers were erected , which prevented a pooling of the resources of the nation . A few illustrations will suffice . Missouri passed a law barring admission into the State of all Texas , Mexican , or American Indian cattle from March to November of each year . Though a State may prevent diseased cattle from entering its  | borders , the banning of all outside cattle was declared unconstitutional , even though Congress had not spoken . Railroad Co. v. Husen , 95 U.S. 465 . Years later , West Virginia passed an Act regulating the natural gas industry . It provided , inter alia , that consumers within the State were to be given preference over out-of-state consumers and that only surplus gas might be carried into other States . The Court held the law unconstitutional as an embargo against interstate commerce . Pennsylvania v. West Virginia , 262 U.S. 553 . If West Virginia could keep its natural gas for itself , Pennsylvania might keep her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iron ore , etc . That was the rationale of the Court . The Court followed the reasoning of the earlier case of West v. Kansas Natural Gas Co. , 221 U.S. 229 , where it had said : " In such commerce , instead of the States , a new power appears and a new welfare , a welfare which transcends that of any State . But rather let us say it is constituted of the welfare of all of the States and that of each State is made the greater by a division of its resources , natural and created , with every other State , and those of every other State with it . This was the purpose , as it is the result , of the interstate commerce clause of the Constitution of the United States . If there is to be a turning backward it must he done by the authority of another instrumentality than a court . " Id. , 255-256 . In the 1930 's when there was a great depression in America , many indigent people moved west to California where warm sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this trend by making it a crime for anyone to bring into the State an indigent non-resident . All members of the Court held that Act unconstitutional . Edwards v. California , 314 U.S. 160 . Some thought the right of free movement from State to State was an incident of national citizenship . A majority of the Court , however , rested their decision on the Commerce Clause , holding that this barrier to the transportation of people across a state line was an unconstitutional embargo .  | Embargoes against interstate commerce would be as effective bar- , riers as the very destruction of a bridge over which an interstate railroad must run . In Kansas Southern Ry . Co. v. Kaw Valley Drainage District , 233 U.S. 75 , the Court did , indeed , prevent such a bridge from being torn down by order of a State that required its removal in order to assist flood control in a river basin . Yet even the ban on embargoes against interstate commerce has exceptions . Protection of the States against the invasion of disease , pests , and plagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. 346 , is typical . The plaintiffs raised cattle in Wisconsin and sold them in New York . The latter State set up safeguards against importation of cattle with Bang 's disease and to that end required that they and the herds from which they came be certified by the chief sanitary officer suant to a state law which gave the government power to remove a person from any area if satisfied with respect to any particular person that his removal was necessary " to preventing him from acting in any manner prejudicial to the public safety or the maintenance of public order . " Petitioner , who was President of the All-India Hindu Mahasabha , challenged the order as infringing his right of free movement under Article 19 ( 1 ) ( d ) , claiming that it was based on efforts to suppress political opposition to certain Government policies . The Court stated that the test was whether the restriction on free movement was reasonable , both as regards the substantive aspects of the restraint and the procedure whereby it was to be imposed . The Court held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to make externment orders was in the discretion of the Government or District Magistrate did not make the Act unreasonable . The Court also rejected a claim that the grounds for the externment order were too vague . These grounds were , in part : " Your activities generally and particularly since the recent trouble in East and West Bengal have been of a communal nature tending to excite hatred between communities . . . your presence and activities in Delhi are likely to prove prejudicial to the maintenance of law and order . . . . Singh v. Bombay , 15 Sup . Ct . Jour. 321 , involved an externment order directing the petitioner to leave Greater Bombay . The order was based on an Act which provided for externment orders by the Commissioner of Police whenever the act or movements of any person were calculated to cause alarm , danger or harm to person or property or where there were reasonable grounds for believing that such person was engaged or about to engage in certain specified offenses , and the Commissioner was of the opinion that witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear of their safety . The maximum period of externment was two years ; and any order could be canceled by the Commissioner if the need for it ceased to exist . The procedure provided that the externed individual would be informed of the allegations against him and given a reasonable chance to explain , including a right to appear by counsel and examine witnesses to clear his character . There was no provision for cross-examining the witnesses against him . But the Court , in upholding the order pointed out that since the Act was based on the need to dispel the fears of such witnesses , its purpose would be defeated if a right to cross-examine them were afforded . Externment orders in America have been sustained only in the extremities of war , as indicated by the Japanese cases mentioned in Lecture 1 .  | of the State of origin as being free of the disease . The New York regulation was upheld as an inspection measure , designed to prevent the spread of the disease and to safeguard the public health . A converse case illustrates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52 , Florida was permitted to prevent shipment out of the State in interstate commerce of citrus fruits that were immature or otherwise unfit for consumption . The export of low-grade , inferior fruit was controlled in the interests of promoting the prestige of the citrus industry , so important to the economy of Florida . These types of embargoes indicate the range of control which the States , with the approval of the Court , have laid on imports into and exports from a State . But in recent years the Court has gone much further . In the extreme case of Breard v. Alexandria , 341 U.S. 622 , a sharply divided Court upheld a Louisiana ordinance that greatly burdened certain types of interstate commerce . In America , there is a vast business in the solicitation of subscriptions to national magazines and periodicals . Solicitors go from town to town , from State to State , knocking on doors and obtaining subscriptions to out-of-state publications . Subscriptions obtained in that way amount to about 50 per cent of the total subscription circulation of our national magazines . Louisiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any home to solicit an order , unless requested or invited to do so by the owner or occupant of the premises . Since local sellers were treated the same as out-ofstate sellers , there was no discrimination against interstate commerce . The Court permitted this method of doing an interstate business to be drastically impeded . The State 's interest in protecting the privacy and quiet of her citizens was held by the Court to be a sufficient basis for suppression of this interstate trade . No more extreme case of a State legislating in the federal domain can probably be found in our books . ( 2 ) Licensing the Privilege of Doing Interstate Commerce. ? In recent decades , Congress has set up many regulatory schemes that require a permit from a federal agency before a particular interstate business may be conducted . Conspicuous are the certificates required of motor carriers and natural gas pipeline companies . The power of the Congress to place those requirements on interstate commerce is clear . The lack of power of a State to exact the same or like conditions from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not license the transport of railroad cars across a boundary river between two States . St. Clair County v. Interstate Transfer Co. , 192 U.S. 454 . It may not require a license from one  | engaged in the interstate express business . Crutcher v. Kentucky , 141 U.S. 47 ; Adams Express Co. v. New York , 232 U.S. 14 . Drummers ? traveling salesmen ? entering a State for the purpose of soliciting orders for out-of-state firms can not be required to get a license or pay a tax for that privilege . Robbins v. Shelby Co. , 120 U.S. 489 ; Real Silk Mills v. Portland , 268 U.S. 325 ; Nippert v. Richmond , 327 U.S. 416 ; Memphis Steam Laundry v. Stone , 342 U.S. 389 . In absence of a contrary regulation by Congress , a carrier doing an interstate business may , however , be regulated in many ways by the State it crosses : registration of the vehicle and obtaining of a driver 's license may be required ( Sprout v. South Bend , 277 U.S. 163 , 169 ) ; the operator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be served in case an action arising out of operation of the vehicle in the State is brought ( Hess v. Pawloski , 274 U.S. 352 , 356 ) ; the carrier can be required to carry adequate liability insurance ( Continental Baking Co. v. Woodring , 286 U.S. 352 , 365 ) and to observe maximum hours of work prescribed by local law for truck drivers ( Welch Co. v. New Hampshire , 306 U.S. 79 ) ; vehicles that are unsafe may be barred from the highway ( Sproles v. Bin f ord , 286 U.S. 374 , 389 ) ; and an interstate carrier may be denied the right to use a particular highway , because of the congestion of traffic and the requirements of safety and security ( Bradley v. Public Utilities Commission , 289 U.S. 92 ) . Moreover , a State may , in the interests of sanitation and health , require the disposition of dead animals ( not slaughtered for food ) at disposal plants in the State and punish the transportation of the carcasses out of the State . Clason v. Indiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to do an interstate business is a power rarely allowed a State . The State may not withhold a permit to operate a bus or a truck in interstate commerce because it deems the existing facilities adequate to handle the business . Buck v. Kuykendall , 267 U.S. 307 . If interstate commerce is to be barred or prohibited or curtailed , it is the Congress that must do it . A State may not take such a drastic step , even to enforce its own laws . Thus Illinois was recently prevented from suspending the operations of interstate truckers for violation of its highway laws relative to the weight of vehicles . Castle v. Hayes Freight Lines , 348 U.S. 61 . Illinois could try the truckers for their violation of those highway laws and fine them or jail them . But the Court held that Illinois could not punish them by suspending their operations . For that would be the equivalent of depriving them of their interstate licenses , which had been granted them under federal law .  | The power to tax the privilege of engaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conduct it , gives effective control over it . The power to tax the privilege has been asserted over and again by the States . And the Court has consistently denied them that authority , as Steamship Co. v. Portwardens , 6 Wall . 31 , illustrates . The reason was expressed in Murdock v. Pennsylvania , 319 U.S. 105 , 112 , " The power to tax the exercise of a privilege is the power to control or suppress its enjoyment . " At times the Court has applied that principle to an extreme . Pennsylvania required a license of a person selling steamship tickets for transportation to or from foreign countries . The law required filing of a bond , and a showing that the agent was of good moral character and an agent for steamship companies . The law was plainly designed to prevent fraud on the public . The Court struck down the law as a regulation of foreign commerce . Di Santo v. Pennsylvania , 273 U.S. 34 . That was in 1927 . By 1941 there was a new Court when California v. Thompson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved a California statute , which required a license for every agent selling tickets for highway travel . It was sustained against an agent who arranged for interstate transportation . The agent was not engaged in interstate transportation ; therefore , said the Court , California was not seeking to license interstate traffic . The law was upheld as a method of protecting the public against fraud , " peculiarly a subject of local concern and the appropriate subject of local regulation . " Id. , 115 . The Di Santo case was accordingly overruled . ( 3 ) Discrimination Against Interstate Commerce. ? Local trade or industry often seeks protection from or preference over products that reach the local market from other States . Local interests that are powerful in the state legislatures can often get laws passed that give the desired protection or preference to the home industries . The legislators who pass those laws , the governors who approve them , and the state courts that sustain them often do not have the national interest in mind . So it is , that over the years a host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for the vigilance of the Supreme Court , sitting in review of state regulations . Thus , Georgia tried to make all vessels touching its ports take Georgia pilots , except vessels operating in Georgia waters , or between Georgia ports and either South Carolina or Florida . This was held invalid under the Commerce Clause as a discriminatory law . Spraigue v. Thompson , 118 U.S. 90.  | Virginia had a law requiring that flour brought into the State for sale be inspected ; and fees were fixed for the inspection . Flour manufactured locally was not required to be inspected . This law was condemned as discriminatory against interstate commerce . Voight v. Wright , 141 U.S. 62 . Florida established a similar inspection system for cement brought into Florida from a foreign nation , while establishing no inspection for cement manufactured in Florida . The Court , noting that the purpose of the law was " to keep out foreign goods , " nullified this law , because it , too , contained a " calculated discrimination against foreign commerce . " Hale v. Bimco Trading Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from non-resident sellers that was not required of resident retailers . A New York retail house rented a display room in a North Carolina hotel , took orders for goods , and had them shipped from New York . The tax on such a person was $250 a year , while the comparable tax on a regular retail merchant in North Carolina was $1 a year . The tax on the New York merchant was accordingly held unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause . Best &; Co. v. Maxwell , 311 U.S. 454 . Some of the most striking cases illustrating the principle involve milk ? a commodity so vital to the health of the community that the right to local regulation of its processing and distribution is well established . Equally beyond doubt is the principle that the Commerce Clause prohibits a State from prohibiting the movement of milk into the State or its export out of the State . But the mind of man is ingenious and has often used the first of these principles in an attempt to defeat the second . In Baldwin v. Seelig , 294 U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Vermont , because the price paid to the producer in Vermont was below the minimum price prescribed by New York for purchases from New York producers . The law was designed to protect New York farmers from the lower Vermont prices . This was an economic barrier against out-of-state competition which the Court held to be unconstitutional . The converse of this situation was presented in Hood &; Sons v. Du Mond , 336 U.S. 525 . Milk from New York State had long supplied Boston , Mass . The distributor , Hood , sought additional facilities in New York for its Boston market . It was denied a permit by New York , because there was a shortage of milk in some of its cities , and New York thought these additional purchases in the New York market  | would be destructive of local interests . The Court nullified the law , as inconsistent with the philosophy of the Commerce Clause that " our economic unit is the Nation , " and that every producer or merchant has " free access to every market in the Nation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbidding the sale of pasteurized milk in the city , unless it was pasteurized and bottled at an approved pasteurization plant within five miles of the center of the city . An Illinois distributor of milk was denied a license to sell its milk in Madison , because its pasteurization plants were more than five miles away . The Court concluded that the ordinance was not a health measure because the milk of the Illinois distributor might be wholesome . It was , in the view of the Court , " an economic barrier protecting a major local industry against competition from without the State " and therefore unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause . Dean Milk Co. v. Madison , 340 U.S. 349 . Judges often disagree , as they did in the two milk cases last discussed , over what constitutes discrimination against interstate commerce . But all agree that the reserved power of the States , expressed in the Tenth Amendment , does not include the power to lay on interstate commerce a heavier hand than is laid on local commerce , or to set up barriers against interstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , one of the least controversial phases of our Commerce Clause law is that the force of the Clause creates an area of free trade , safe from state laws calculated to discriminate against interstate commerce . ( 4 ) Burdening Interstate Commerce. ? The arguments as to whether a state law placed an undue burden on interstate commerce have created sharp divisions in the Court . Every state law touching or affecting interstate commerce is in a sense a burden on it . Some are quite incidental and quite unimportant . Others have a suffocating effect , as severe as any discriminatory law . In between are laws of all shades and degrees ; and they have produced a legion of cases . As I said earlier , some Justices have maintained that the Court should not undertake to determine whether a state law burdens interstate commerce . They have argued that the role of the judiciary should be restricted to determining whether a state law and a federal law are in conflict and whether a state law discriminates against interstate commerce . The view was recently reiterated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state legislation imposes an undue burden ' on interstate commerce raises pure questions of policy , which the Con- stitution intended should be resolved by the Congress . " Morgan v. Virginia , 328 U.S. 373 , 387 . That view , however , has not prevailed . The Court sits to determine how great a burden a state law places on interstate commerce . That frequently entails weighing evidence , drawing nice lines , and making close and difficult decisions on important policy questions . The cases where a State has been allowed to place burdens on interstate commerce are too numerous to list . Thus , a State may license trainmen engaged in interstate commerce in order to insure their skill and fitness . Smith v. Alabama , 124 U.S. 465 ; Nashville , C. &; St. L. Ry. v. Alabama , 128 U.S. 96 . It may define the size of crews manning interstate trains , Chicago , R. I. &; P. Ry . Co. v. Arkansas , 219 U.S. 453 ; Missouri Pacific R. Co. v. Norwood , 283 U.S. 249 , and prescribe regulations for payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 233 U.S. 685 . It may require that guard posts be placed on bridges of an interstate railroad . New York , N. H. &; H. R. Co. v. New York , 165 U.S. 628 . It may limit the speed of interstate trains within city limits . Erb v. Morasch , 177 U.S. 584 . It may require an interstate railroad to eliminate grade crossings . Erie R. Co. v. Public Utility Commissioners , 254 U.S. 394 , 409 , 412 . It may require payment of fees for use of harbors , Cooley v. Board of Wardens , 12 How . 299 ; Clyde Mallory Lines v. Alabama , 296 U.S. 261 . State laws have been sustained which abolish the car stove in interstate trains ( New York , N. H. &; H. R. Co. v. New York , 165 U.S. 628 ) , which require locomotives to be supplied with electric head lights ( Atlantic Coast Line v. Georgia , 234 U.S. 280 ) , and which make a caboose mandatory ( Terminal Railroad Assn. v. Brotherhood , 318 U.S. 1 ) . As I have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to merchandise moving in interstate commerce as a means of protecting public health . And it may regulate ticket brokers who sell interstate or foreign transportation , so as to safeguard the public against fraud . A few cases illustrate the nature of the prohibited " burden " on interstate commerce . The early case of Foster v. Master and Wardens , 94 U.S. 246 , invalidated a Louisiana law which required that the master and wardens of the port of New Orleans be the exclusive inspectors of the hatches of all sea-going vessels arriving at that port . The object of the law was to certify the quantity , value , and condition of the cargoes ? whether imports or exports ? for the protection of buyers and consumers . Louisiana was held to have no power to bar other persons from making such inspections . Louisiana 's law was held  | to be an attempt to fasten a monopoly service on interstate and foreign commerce , which was unreasonable and oppressive . Another type of " burden " is illustrated by Seaboard Air Line R. Co. v. Blackwell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains to slow down almost to a stop at each grade crossing was invalidated . Likewise in Cleveland &; St. L. R. Co. v. Illinois , 177 U.S. 514 , an Illinois law requiring interstate trains to stop at certain stations was struck down . And see St. Louis &; S. F. R. Co. v. Commission , 254 U.S. 535 ; St. Louis-S . F. R. Co. v. Commission , 261 U.S. 369 . The crucial factor in this class of cases is the incidence of the particular law on the interstate activity or transaction . See Union Brokerage Co. v. Jensen , 322 U.S. 202 , 210 . If the local law materially restricts the free flow of commerce across state lines , or if it interferes with the interstate activity or business in matters with respect to which uniformity of regulation is essential in the national interest , the law is unconstitutional . But how are such matters determined ? What are the criteria for decision ? Many questions are fairly debatable , both as regards the reasonableness of a state law and its wisdom or propriety . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinions of the Court say that the law must stand . The question of the " burden " on interstate commerce is " not to be determined by weighing on the judicial scales the merits of the legislative choice and rejecting it if the weight of evidence presented in Court appears to favor a different standard . " South Carolina Highway Dept. v. Barnwell Bros. , 303 U.S. 177 , 191 . The Court in that case went on to say , " Being a legislative judgment it is presumed to be supported by facts known to the legislature unless facts judicially known or proved preclude that possibility . " The proving of facts to belie the legislative judgment is sometimes an onerous undertaking in this type of litigation . Perhaps the case that best illustrates how it can be done successfully is Southern Pacific Co. v. Arizona , 325 U.S. 761 . That case involved the question whether an Arizona law , limiting railroad trains to 14 passenger cars or 70 freight cars , was an unconstitutional burden on commerce when applied to interstate trains . The case was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 9 large volumes containing over 4,000 pages of evidence . At the trial , there were extensive hearings lasting over five months . The record showed that :  | railroads often run over 100 freight cars on a train , sometimes as many as 125 or even 160 cars ; this law would make the particular carrier which challenged the regulation haul 130 per cent more trains in Arizona than would otherwise be necessary ; the additional cost to the two railroads traversing Arizona would be about one million dollars a year ; the conversion and reconversion of train lengths at terminals delayed traffic and impeded efficient operation ; it was not feasible to convert the trains into the smaller units at the border of Arizona and then reconvert them as soon as the trains left the State , because of the absence of switching and other facilities at those points ; so it was necessary to comply with the Arizona law long before the trains reached Arizona and long after they had left that State ; most States had no limitation on train length , only two having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to more trains in operation with more grade crossing accidents . These were the main facts adduced in evidence against the Arizona law . In favor of the Arizona law was impressive evidence indicating that the safety of the men responsible for railroad operation was increased by restricted train lengths , especially in the winding canyons that mark so much of our western country . A divided Court held the law invalid . After giving weight to the legislative finding , a majority of the Court nonetheless determined that the need for uniformity in interstate train regulations made it more important that the train lengths go unregulated than that local safety regulations be sustained . The Court was charged with acting as a " super-legislature . " Id. , 788 . But whether that label is or is not deserved , the Court in this type of case necessarily sits in judgment on a host of complex facts and sometimes ends up in disagreement with the legislative decision . Morgan v. Virginia , 328 U.S. 373 , is another case where the Court , in the interest of uniformity of regulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required motor vehicle carriers ( both interstate and intrastate ) to segregate the white passengers from Negroes so that contiguous seats would not be occupied by persons of different  | races at the same time . Violation of the law by the carrier was a misdemeanor . The driver was charged with supervising the seating requirement . A Negro , who was traveling interstate , violated this segregation requirement and was tried and convicted . His conviction was reversed on the ground that the Virginia law was unconstitutional . This interstate passenger was traveling from Virginia to Maryland through the District of Columbia . There was no segregation of passengers in the District . Moreover , while a few States required segregation of passengers on buses , most States did not ; and many absolutely forbade it . Passing from one type of State into another and then into still another would entail a constant shifting of seats . This necessity of reseating the interstate passengers to satisfy the diverse laws of the several States was held to be too great a burden for interstate commerce to bear . Moreover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or colored made such a law difficult of reasonable application in an amicable fashion . These reasons led the Court to conclude that segregation by a State of interstate passengers on the basis of race was an unreasonable interference with commerce ; that the requirements for the seating of interstate passengers required national uniformity , not diverse , contradictory , and confusing regulations by the States . ( 5 ) Taxing Interstate Commerce. ? The Constitution of the United States , like the Indian Constitution , has some explicit provisions relating to taxes that the States may not impose . These are imposts or duties on imports or exports , in general banned by Article I , Section 10 , which I will discuss later . I am here concerned with taxes of a different character ? sales taxes , use taxes , taxes on gross receipts , and the other types of taxes laid on interstate businesses or interstate transactions by local taxing authorities . It is obvious that an interstate industry doing business in several States gets benefits and protection from each of them . Society offers many services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious ones . Highways , water and light , health centers , parks , hospitals , the maintenance of courts for the administration of justice are others . All who live in the community benefit by those services and should help pay for them . A tax on property located in the State raises no problems , assuming discrimination is not present . But frequently the question arises as to what property is within the reach of the State . Under our Constitution , a State is barred by the Fourteenth Amendment from  | depriving any person of property " without due process of law . " And under our decisions a state tax laid on tangible property having an actual situs outside the taxing State violates due process . Frick v. Pennsylvania , 268 U.S. 473 . The doctrine of the Frick case is not based on the Commerce Clause . The Frick case defines what is beyond the jurisdiction of a State to tax by reason of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . See Wisconsin v. J. C. Penney Co. , 311 U.S. 435 ; Stale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , the Commerce Clause cases define , controversy by controversy , what taxes would place an undue burden on interstate commerce . But though the question of due process is not involved , it has probably conditioned much of what has been written about state taxation of interstate business . The field is far too vast to be covered in a brief space . A few illustrations involving various types of taxes will show the main contours of the law . First , there is the franchise tax . If a multi-state enterprise had to pay a franchise tax on its entire capital stock , surplus , and profits to each of the States in which it operated , it would be at a tremendous disadvantage compared with local industries . It would , in other words , pay taxes which in practical effect placed an extra burden on the business because it was interstate in character . Realization of that problem has led to a requirement that such taxes be apportioned . A case involving a Texas statute illustrates one aspect of the problem . Ford Motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembly plants in Texas . The parts assembled in Texas are manufactured outside that State ; but most of the assembled vehicles are sold in Texas . Texas had a franchise tax that was a charge on such proportion of the outstanding stock , surplus , and undivided profits of a corporation as the gross receipts of its Texas business bore to its total gross receipts . The Court sustained the tax against a claim that it violated both the Commerce Clause and due process of law . Ford Motor Co. v. Beauchamp , 308 U.S. 331 . In International Harvester Co. v. Evatt , 329 U.S. 416 , Harvester was a foreign corporation doing business in Ohio . It had factories and retail stores in Ohio and many factories and stores in other States . Goods produced in Ohio were sold both in Ohio and outside Ohio . Goods sold in Ohio were often manufactured in other States . Ohio previously had laid a tax on shares of capital stock not attributable to nor represented by a foreign corporation 's assets or business in Ohio ; and that tax had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an undue burden on interstate commerce . Air-Way Corp . v. Day , 266 U.S. 71 . Ohio revised its law and used a different formula to determine what part of a foreign corporation 's total capital stock represented its Ohio business and property . It first took half of the value of the issued capital stock and multiplied it by a fraction , the numerator of which was the value of the firm 's Ohio property and the denominator of which was the value of the firm 's total property . The other half was multiplied by another fraction , whose numerator was the value of the business done by the firm in Ohio and whose denominator was the total business of the company . The sum of these two products was the tax base . This formula of apportionment was upheld under both the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . The tax was held to bear a just relation to the value of doing business in Ohio , even though sales of goods manufactured in Ohio but sold outside the State , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were counted as Ohio business . Any method of allocating to one State its fair share of a nation-wide , unitary business is at best an approximation . Accounting is not an exact science . One accounting method may show no net income attributable to a particular branch ; and yet a formula of apportionment may properly credit a portion of the profits of the total business to that branch . Such was the case in Butler Bros. v. McColgan , 315 U.S. 501 , involving the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment , not the Commerce Clause , yet still relevant to the general problem . In that case the overall profit was over one million dollars , of which some 8 per cent was allocated to California . The apportionment formula averaged the percentages which ( a ) value of real and tangible personal property , ( b ) wages , salaries , commissions , and other compensation of employees , and ( c ) gross sales ( less returns and allowances ) attributable to the California branch bore to the corresponding items of all the branches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the formula was not fairly calculated to assign to California that portion of the net income reasonably attributed to that State . A full analysis in a given case would entail an autopsy of a business year , appraising the various factors that contributed to the income . Some might be unitary and thus inseparable from the whole ; others might reflect conditions purely local and hence indigenous to particular branches . Where the formula on its face seems reasonably related to business activities in a particular State , the burden is on the taxpayer to  | show that the diversities and character of a particular business cause the formula as applied to it to distort the values being taxed . An ad valorem tax on real property owned by an interstate enterprise presents no Commerce Clause difficulties . But questions often arise when ad valorem taxes are levied on chattels or other personal property . Railroad cars are constantly entering and leaving the various States ; yet during the taxable year a fixed proportion of the cars may be in one State . As early as 1891 , the Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tax such proportion of the capital stock of a company as the number of miles over which it ran cars in the State bore to the total number of miles over which it ran cars in all the States . Pullman 's Car Co. v. Pennsylvania , 141 U.S. 18 . That case did not involve an ad valorem tax ; but its formula was sustained in Ott v. Mississippi Barge Line , 336 U.S. 169 ? decided in 1949 ? for the levy of such a tax by Louisiana on barges operating up and down the Mississippi River and doing business for part of that haul in Louisiana . In theory , the formula offers no chance for multiple taxation . If in fact railroad cars or barges were not in the taxing State as frequently as the formula would indicate and that fact were established , the Commerce Clause question would be in a different posture . The Court has sustained the tax only on an assumption , not rebutted , that the formula reflects an average portion of the property permanently in the State . Id. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary counterpart ? of another ruling of the Court , that where no specific railroad cars nor any average of railroad cars was so continuously outside the home State of the corporation as to be taxable by other States , the State of the domicile could tax the entire mass . New York Central v. Miller , 202 U.S. 584 . Yet where the rolling stock or vessels are regularly outside the domiciliary State , it may not put an ad valorem tax on them . Standard Oil Co. v. Peck , 342 U.S. 382 . Once the other States can tax on an apportionment basis , multiple taxation of the interstate enterprise would result , if the State of the domicile could tax all the property . The problems of multiple taxation as applied to airlines are no different in substance from those involving barges and railroad cars , as our two leading cases , Northwest Airlines v. Minnesota , 322 U.S. 292 , and Braniff Airways v. Nebraska Board , 347 U.S. 590 , illustrate . Gross receipts taxes on interstate enterprises present comparable problems . The name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as the results under the federal Constitution are concerned . Our Court is concerned less with the name , than with the practical operation of the  | tax . See Lawrence v. Tax Commission , 286 U.S. 276 , 280 . The name " gross receipts " tax was , indeed , held to be a misnomer in Railway Express Agency v. Virginia , 347 U.S. 359 ; and a tax labeled " gross receipts " was stricken down as a disguised tax on the privilege of doing the interstate business . The true gross receipts tax , however , when properly apportioned , has been sustained many times in its application to interstate business . The cases are too numerous to analyze in detail . A few of them , however , illustrate the problem . At one extreme is Fargo v. Michigan , 121 U.S. 230 , where Michigan placed a tax on gross receipts received for transporting goods from points in Michigan to points in other States and from other States to points in Michigan . It was held to be invalid as being in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which , if duplicated by other States , would lead to a multiple tax burden being placed on the interstate business . At the other extreme is Erie Railroad v. Pennsylvania , 158 U.S. 431 , where a State levied a tax on the gross receipts from the tolls collected by one railroad from other interstate carriers for use of the former 's track in Pennsylvania . The tax was sustained , for it reached only commerce carried on in the State and hence was apportioned to intrastate activities . In between those extremes are a multitude of cases , some closer to one extreme than the other , and presenting facts as complicated as the intricacies of modern business . Western Live Stock v. Bureau , 303 U.S. 250 , involved a gross receipts tax on amounts received from the sale of advertising space by one engaged in publishing newspapers and magazines in the taxing State and selling them in that and in other States . The tax was sustained under the Commerce Clause , because of the distinctly local nature of the business of preparing , printing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had interstate features . But there was no tax on the interstate phase of the business and no possibility of other States repeating the tax and thus laying more than one on that phase of the business . The same considerations saved the gross receipts tax in Canton R. Co. v. Rogan , 340 U.S. 511 . There the receipts were earned from the handling of goods by a carrier and the switching of cars at a terminal , all intrastate activities . The fact that the goods were in foreign commerce and that the handling was an incident in the export-import process was therefore immaterial .  | The leading decisions involving the sales and use taxes are generally of a recent vintage . They are products of the intensified search for revenue that the depression and the war years produced . McGoldrick v. Berwind-White Co. , 309 U.S. 33 , sustained a New York sales tax on a contract of sale made in New York for shipment of coal from Pennsylvania to a New York purchaser . Delivery of the goods within the State for purposes of consumption was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax . Adams Mfg . Co. v. Storen , 304 U.S. 307 , held invalid the converse tax ? a sales tax levied by the State of the seller upon receipts from goods manufactured there and sold in other States . The tax was on wholly unapportioned revenues from an interstate transaction . So far as sales taxes were concerned , it seemed from those two cases that the Constitution permitted taxation of the transfer of possession to the purchaser within the taxing State but not taxation of the sale by the State of the seller , if the tax were not apportioned . In this regard , Article 286 of the Indian Constitution is relevant . That Article provides , in part : " ( 1 ) No law of a State shall impose , or authorise the imposition of , a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place " ( a ) outside the state ... . " Explanation. ? For the purposes of sub-clause ( a ) , a sale or purchase shall be deemed to have taken place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered as a direct result of such sale or purchase for the purpose of consumption in that State , notwithstanding the fact that under the general law relating to sale of goods the property in the goods has by reason of such sale or purchase passed in another State . " ( 2 ) Except in so far as Parliament may by law otherwise provide , no law of a State shall impose , or authorise the imposition of , a tax on the sale or purchase of any goods where such sale or purchase takes place in the course of inter-State trade or commerce .... " As I read the decisions construing that Article , particularly Bombay v. United Motors Ltd. , 16 Sup . Ct . Jour. 373 , and Himmatlal v. Madhya Pradesh , 41 A.I.R . 403 , both decided by the Supreme Court of India , I judge that the constitutional law of India relative to the sales tax draws a line close to that drawn by Berwind-White and Storen under the United States Constitution .  | But the line drawn by the latter cases was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 322 U.S. 327 , Arkansas was not permitted to levy a sales tax on purchases of goods in Tennessee from Tennessee firms for consumption in Arkansas . Berwind-White was not overruled . It was distinguished on the ground that in that case the seller had a sales office in New York , while in the McLeod case the seller maintained no offices in the taxing State but obtained his orders in Arkansas from traveling salesmen , by mail , and by telephone , and filled them in Tennessee . The sales were completed , said the Court , in New York , in the Berwind-White case ; and in Tennessee , in the McLeod case . The State of the seller was further curtailed in Freeman v. Hewit , 329 U.S. 249 . There Indiana laid a tax on the proceeds of securities sold by a citizen of Indiana through a broker on the New York exchange . The local activity was receipt of income in Indiana . A tax on the fees of the broker would , of course , be a tax on fees from interstate transactions . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the brokerage fees , was as intensely local as receipt of the proceeds of any Indiana property sold with the aid of the mails or other interstate agencies . Nevertheless , the proceeds were held not taxable by reason of the Commerce Clause . At present , sales taxes can not be levied by the State of the purchaser on some out-of-state purchases ; and they can not be levied by the State of the seller on either the interstate transaction or the net proceeds which the seller receives from it . Technical distinctions have taken the place of practical realities ; and the power of the States has been more severely curtailed than was necessary to save interstate commerce from the burden of multiple taxation . The ground lost in the sales tax field has not been regained by resort to the use tax . A tax imposed on the user has , of course , a solid basis , provided it is not discriminatory against interstate trade , since the local use in the State of destination is the taxable event ? an event that occurs after interstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 300 U.S. 577 ; Southern Pacific Co. v. Gallagher , 306 U.S. 167 . The American constitutional law parallels at this point the Indian constitutional law , as reflected in Article 304 of the Indian Constitution and the important dictum of Bombay v. United Motors Ltd. , 16 Sup . Ct . Jour. 373 , 379 . Article 304 provides , in part :  | " Notwithstanding anything in article 301 or article 303 , the Legislature of a State may by law " ( a ) impose on goods imported from other States any tax to which similar goods manufactured or produced in that State are subject , so , however , as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced .... " The dictum in the Bombay case is as follows : " Thus the States in India have full power of imposing what in American State legislation is called the use tax , gross receipts tax , etc. , not to speak of the familiar property tax , subject only to the condition that such tax is imposed on all goods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although such taxation is undoubtedly calculated to fetter inter-State trade and commerce . In other words , the commercial unity of India is made to give way before the State-power of imposing any ' non-discriminatory tax on goods imported from sister States . " We have found in America that use taxes are difficult to collect against the thousands of purchasers . And so the States have endeavored to make the sellers collect use taxes for them . The major constitutional contests over the use tax have , indeed , centered on those attempts . In Nelson v. Sears , Roebuck &; Co. , 312 U.S. 359 , a chain store was operating both inside and outside Iowa . Iowa was allowed to make the chain responsible for the use tax on all purchases made at the Iowa stores and on orders placed at those stores but filled by shipments from out-of-state branches . The Court went further and required the chain to be collector for the use tax on orders placed by Iowa purchasers directly with out-of-state branches . That burden was exacted as part of the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interstate transactions . The same result was reached in General Trading Co. v. Tax Commission , 322 U.S. 335 , where Iowa was allowed to make the out-of-state company its tax collector , though the company was doing business in Iowa only through traveling salesmen who solicited the orders . But the State of the purchaser was denied such power in Miller Bros . Co. v. Maryland , 347 U.S. 340 , though the seller 's contacts with the taxing State were hardly less attenuated . The seller did not have travel- ing salesmen in the taxing State ; but it advertised there by newspapers , radio , and direct mail . Moreover , it commonly made deliveries in the taxing State by truck . The effort to make the out-of-state seller collect the use tax was defeated not by the Commerce Clause , but by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . The use tax collection cases are , indeed , more excursions into the field of due process than into interstate commerce . They turn basically on whether the taxing State has sufficient contacts with the seller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him the duty of tax collector . ( 6 ) Imports and Exports. ? I mentioned earlier the special provision in Article I , Section 10 of the American Constitution relative to imports and exports . It reads : " No State shall , without the Consent of the Congress , lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports , except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its inspection Laws ; and the net Produce of all Duties and Imposts , laid by any State on Imports or Exports , shall be for the Use of the Treasury of the United States ; and all such Laws shall be subject to the Revision and Control of the Congress . " The provision is somewhat analogous to Article 286 ( 1 ) ( b ) of the Indian Constitution , which reads : " No law of a State shall impose , or authorise the imposition of , a tax on the sale or purchase of goods where such sale or purchase takes place . . . in the course of the import of the goods into , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India . " The scope of the Import-Export Clause in the United States Constitution is not coterminous with that of the Commerce Clause . As we have seen , the latter contains no specific restrictions on the States ; nor does it speak in terms of taxes . It has , however , been construed as creating an area of trade free from state interference , and yet not barring taxation which makes interstate commerce pay its way . The result has been an accommodation between competing interests : on the one hand , the need for interstate commerce to pay its fair share  | of the cost of local government ; on the other hand , the need to avoid discrimination against interstate commerce , or a levy on the privilege of doing it , or an undue burden on it . But the Import-Export Clause contains no such qualifications . It prohibits " any " tax on imports or exports without the consent of Congress , with but the one exception of inspection fees . Article 304 of the Indian Constitution allows the legislature of a State to " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which similar goods manufactured or produced in that State are subject , so , however , as not to discriminate between goods so imported and goods so manufactured or produced . " But there is no such qualification or exception in the Import-Export Clause of the United States Constitution . None is expressed ; nor has any been implied . And so the fact that a tax is not discriminatory and would not be a " burden " on commerce under the Commerce Clause tests does not save it under the ImportExport Clause . If the tax is on an import or export , it is unconstitutional save for the narrow exception stated in the Import-Export Clause . The major contests in this area have been waged over when export has started and when import has ended . The United States Supreme Court first considered that problem in 1827 in Brown v. Maryland , 12 Wheat . 419 . It was there held that a State could not require importers of foreign goods to take out a license and pay a fee for conducting their business . That case created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congenial to Indian constitutional law as Travancore Cochin v. Vilas Factory , 16 Sup . Ct . Jour. 471 , 477 , makes clear . The " original package " doctrine dilutes the taxing powers of the importing States by requiring them to withhold any tax on the imported goods , until they have " become incorporated and mixed up with the mass of property " in the State . The fear was that unless strong sanctions were given the ImportExport Clause , the seaboard States would place unequal taxation on imports at the expense of the States in the interior . The aim was to get uniformity of import duties by leaving the entire matter to Congress . Brown v. Maryland held that the constitutional immunity of imported goods survives arrival in the country and persists at least until the goods are sold in their original packages . Resales are not , however , within the immunity . Waring v. Mayor , 8 Wall . 110 . But Hooven dr Allison Co. v. Evatt , 324 U.S. 652 , decided in 1945 , went further and held that the immunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own use ? in that case bales of hemp brought in from the Pacific for the manufacture by the importer into cordage . The export has started once delivery has been made to a common carrier for export . Spalding dr Bros. v. Edwards , 262 U.S. 66 . But such delivery is not a sine qua non . Other circumstances may show the same degree of certainty that the goods are headed overseas . That is true of oil , once it is pumped into the hold of a vessel furnished by the foreign purchaser for shipment abroad . Richfield Oil Corp . v. State Board , 329 U.S. 69 . But a purpose and plan to export the commodities are not enough . The goods must have entered the export stream before immunity attaches . And so a partially dismantled plant that has been sold to a foreign purchaser , who plans to take it overseas , is taxable by a State until the materials are actually committed to that destination . The fact that title has passed and possession has been taken for the purchaser is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 337 U.S. 154 . In America there have been no more important problems in federalism than those arising under the Commerce Clause . The late Justice Rutledge wrote in 1946 , " From the disunited states of 1786 , which interstate trade barriers had created , has grown the United States of 1946 . No small part of that growth has been due to the effects of the commerce clause and its administration . Perhaps no other constitutional provision has played a greater part . " A Declaration of Legal Faith , 72-73 . Our Congress has done much to keep the system in balance . The Court , too , has played a significant role . The early entrance of the judiciary into the field set a precedent that has been followed ever since . The courts have been active agencies in removing barriers that might , through gradual accretion , have either paralyzed the whole flow of commerce or produced a degree of Balkanization which would have altered the unitary character of the United States . Congress , of course , could have removed those barriers and probably would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed . As a result of the case by case approach , there has been no great lag between the creation of the forbidden barrier or burden and its removal by the judiciary . The principles which govern in this field are simple to state but difficult to apply . Their application produces a great contrariety of  | opinion . Most of the major decisions have been by a divided Court . The fact that there is a five-to-four decision usually means that there is at hand a five-to-four problem . Judges are not perverse ; they look for unanimity , not disagreement . And yet the issues are usually , so closely drawn in this part of the commerce field that differences are more common than agreement . The reason is obvious . The competition is between the requirements of free trade on the one hand and the public welfare and the need for local revenue on the other . Interstate commerce should not be immune from all regulation and from all revenue measures imposed by local authorities . Interstate trade benefits as much from local laws as local trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs of it . No syllogism can supply the answer as to how much is a fair share . These problems , like most problems in law , are not solved by logic . Their answers rest on an appraisal of practical considerations , on the likelihood of injury or prejudice to the interstate mechanism , if it is saddled with a particular regulation . The problems involve large policy questions , in the solution of which the judiciary is heavily implicated . Judges must be more than lawyers ; they must be statesmen as well . For their vision may well determine how commercially united America ? or India ? will be . The cases often bring imponderables into play . The predilections of a judge may influence particular decisions . The balance may be so evenly cast that the result may turn on whether at heart the judge is more of a federalist than a states ' righter , or vice versa . Constitutions can say that commerce must be free ; but over the years the courts will be largely the ones who will implement these provisions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the performance of the judiciary in that regard has , on the whole , produced a highly commendable record . A national area of free trade has flourished ; yet interstate commerce has been required to pay its way ; it has not become either a lawless element of our society or so sacrosanct as to be immune from local regulation and control .  | The problem of man in the field of political science has been not merely the establishment of a government , but also the protection of the people against the government which was established . The problem is not peculiar to any people nor to any continent . It is universal , for people are people whatever their race or color . Power is a heady thing no matter who holds it ; those in power need checks and restraints lest they come to identify the common good with their own tastes and desires , and their continuation in office as essential to the preservation of the nation . As Oliver Cromwell said in 1654 , " Of what assurance is a Law . . . if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is such a law like to be lasting ? It will be a rope of sand ; will give no security ; for the same men may unbuild what they have built . " The system of checks and balances , discussed in an earlier Lecture , serves a high purpose in diluting the power of each branch of government , making it subject to restraint by the other branches . A strong , independent judiciary is a part of the guarantee which a free people need , lest the executive and legislative branches become a law unto themselves . When the American Colonies were under Britain , they had felt the burden of oppressive laws passed by a Parliament in distant London . The taxes they bore were in part levied from abroad and used to  | finance the cost of keeping control over the unruly Colonists . Parliament had authorized troops to be quartered among them . Through actions of the royal government the people had lost their right to assemble and to petition the government . Each of the Colonies later had a state government ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their right to jury trial in civil cases . The people had seen their legislatures pass bills of attainder , sentencing men to death or banishment , without a trial by jury . They had seen legislatures allow worthless paper money to be used as legal tender to pay honest debts . They had seen legislators vote to impose a discriminatory tax on a free press . The American Colonists had also experienced the lash of subservient judges , who did the bidding of the Crown in crucial matters , including the use of unconscionable search warrants . There were exceptions ; for the American judiciary was not immune from the contagious influence of the spirit of independence sweeping the American Colonies . There were also exceptions among the legislatures . The local bodies , representing the people , often stood adamant against the demands of the British Parliament or the Royal Governors . But when the separation from Britain had been completed , memories of executive , legislative , and judicial despotism were still fresh . Hence , one of the first things the Colonies did after they declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rights . One , drafted by George Mason , was adopted by Virginia on June 12 , 1776 , a few weeks before the American Declaration of Independence . Other States followed suit , for the desire to protect human rights against the despotism of legislatures and courts was deep and demanding . This first American Bill of Rights is so important in American history that I have included it as Appendix I. These Bills of Rights safeguarded the people against their state governments , which were central in the scheme of things at the time the Constitution was being drafted . The need for a federal government was emphasized by military , fiscal , and economic matters . The idea of a Bill of Rights to control the national government that was being created did not enter much into the deliberations . Yet , when the proposed National Constitution was published , the absence of a Bill of Rights applicable to the new federal government was noted as its main defect . At once , the demand for a national Bill of Rights arose from the towns and rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former . In any event , all shades of opinion demanded a Bill of Rights  | to curb the new government about to be created . Thomas Jefferson expressed the sentiment when he wrote , " a Bill of Rights is what the people are entitled to against every government on earth , general or particular . " It seemed for a while that the Constitution might not be adopted , because of the absence of a Bill of Rights . Some States ? Massachusetts and Virginia ? refused to ratify , until they had been given assurances that a Bill of Rights would be adopted . Consequently , as soon as the First Congress met , Amendments to the Constitution embodying a Bill of Rights were introduced . The main architect was James Madison of Virginia . The provisions of the Bill of Rights which Madison drew were not new , for he borrowed freely from the existing constitutions of the several States . Not all of the rights that were incorporated in the new Bill of Rights were in any one state constitution . At least four rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religion , freedom of the press , trial by jury , and the guaranty against being deprived of life , liberty , or property without due process of law . Some of these rights traced to roots deep in English history . Others ? such as the protection against unreasonable searches and seizures ? were creations of the American experience . For the Colonists had been plagued with the invidious writs of assistance ? the general search warrants that were good for all places at any time of day or night , the ones that James Otis inveighed against as destroying the inviolate character of a man 's home . One of the most important rights ? the right of free speech ? was not contained in any of the state constitutions . The right to speak freely on the floor of the legislature , without being held to account to any court , was , of course , recognized by the state constitutions . This right had derived from the great Parliamentary struggle that had gone on in England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries over the prerogatives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Parliament , defended by Peter Wentworth , John Elliot , and other unsung heroes , and finally engrossed in the English Bill of Rights of 1689 , was firmly established in America by the time the Constitution was adopted . But free speech in general was not held in such high estate . No state constitution guaranteed it . Thomas Jefferson and James Madison , however , were its protagonists ; and their promotion of the guaranty was vigorous . As Charles Warren , Congress , The Constitution and the Supreme Court ( 1930 ) , 84 , has said , " The right to freedom of  | speech , in general , as a new and separate guaranty , was created by the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution .... " I will return later on to an analysis of the separate provisions of the Bill of Rights . Suffice it here to note that some of the guarantees were ancient , some new . All were deemed essential as a curb first , on the powers of government , and second , as a curb on the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by nature , has the seeds of tyranny deeply implanted within him , " said an early memorial of the Town of Pittsfield , Mass. , whose people insisted on a Bill of Rights for the Constitution . Later , James Madison wrote , " In all cases where a majority are united by common interest or passion , the rights of the minority are in danger . What motives are to restrain them ? A prudent regard to the maxim that honesty is the best policy is found by experience to be as little regarded by bodies of men as by individuals . Respect for character is always diminished in proportion to the number among whom the blame or praise is to be divided . Conscience , thef only remaining tie , is known to be inadequate in individuals : In large numbers , little is to be expected from it . Besides , Religion itself may become a motive to persecution &; oppression. ? These observations are verified by the Histories of every Country antient &; modern . " I Farrand , The Records of the Federal Convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal objects in setting up a national government was " the necessity , of providing more effectually for the security of private rights , and the steady dispensation of Justice . " The desire to have a Constitution and a Bill of Rights was a desire to put certain rights beyond the immediate reach of government . Constitutions can , of course , be amended . But the amending process is usually slow enough to give passions time to cool and reason time to take counsel . It well may be that guarantees which must be written are less secure than those so embedded in the hearts of men that they need not be written . Certainly Britain has for Englishmen a constitution which , though not written , is as enduring as human institutions can be . And Australia , though without a Bill of Rights , practices and preaches a lively democratic creed that is respectful of the rights of man . But in the perspective of history , written constitutions often serve a high function . That may well have been India 's case . Certainly it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary process of the fusion of the American Colonies into one . A Bill of Rights was the necessary addendum to allay the fears and suspicions of those who , having  | known the tyranny of government , suspected that the new one they had created might fall into habits as vicious as those of all that had preceded . The Bill of Rights was described by Madison as a bulwark against the Legislature and the Executive , a bulwark to be defended by the Judiciary . Speaking of these proposed Amendments , Madison told his colleagues , " If they are incorporated into the Constitution , independent tribunals of justice will consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights ; they will be an impenetrable bulwark against every assumption of power in the Legislative or Executive ; they will be naturally led to resist every encroachment upon rights expressly stipulated for in the Constitution by the declaration of rights . " 1 Annals of Congress 439 , First Congress , 1st Session , June 8 , 1789 . On September 25 , 1789 , Congress proposed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became a part of the Constitution , when Virginia , by voting in the affirmative , brought the number of ratifying States to the necessary three-fourths . The text of these first eight Amendments to the Constitution is so important to this discussion that I have printed them as Appendix II . ' A reading of these Amendments shows they were designed to curb all branches of government ? the Legislative , Executive , and Judicial . The First Amendment lays a prohibition on Congress in haec verba . But the despotism of legislatures was not the only fear of the proponents of the Bill of Rights . As Justice Black wrote in Adamson v. California , 332 U.S. 46 , 70 , " The Fifth , Sixth , and Eighth Amendments were pointedly aimed at confining exercise of power by courts and judges within precise boundaries , particularly in the procedure used for the trial of criminal cases . " The manner in which the Bill of Rights has been employed in restraint of the Judiciary as well as the Legislative and Executive will be developed later . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rights , it was limited to placing restraints on the Federal Government , not on the States . The Bill of Rights was no deterrent to state action repressive of civil rights . So far as the Bill of Rights was concerned , the States could favor one religion over another , subsidize a church , limit freedom of speech , license the press , authorize unlimited search warrants , ' The Indian Constitution contains a recital of Fundamental Rights which I have included as Appendix IV to this Lecture . These Fundamental Rights cover much but not all of the ground of our own Bill of Rights . They also include other guarantees , some of which are analogous to those contained in the Thirteenth , Fourteenth , Fifteenth , and Nineteenth Amendments to the American Constitution .  | abolish the jury system , and conduct their criminal trials in any manner they saw fit . The Bill of Rights limited federal , not state , officials . And the Tenth Amendment strengthened states ' rights by making explicit that powers not delegated to the Federal Government are reserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill of Rights acts as a restraint on certain conduct of the States . The manner in which it has come to have that effect is a significant chapter in American constitutional history that followed the Civil War . That war , under Lincoln , had as its main objective the maintenance of the Union against the actions of a rebellious minority of the States . The war Lincoln led was won ; and the Union was saved . The slavery issue had ignited the conflict ; and that issue continued to have repercussions long after hostilities ended . It was responsible for the addition of three Amendments to the Constitution ? the Thirteenth , Fourteenth , and Fifteenth , which I have added as Appendix III to this Lecture . The Thirteenth Amendment , which abolished slavery , was ratified December 18 , 1865 . The Fourteenth Amendment , which enlarged the class of citizens and protected the newly emancipated Negroes against certain action of the States , was ratified July 28 , 1868 . And the Fifteenth Amendment , which protected the rights of the Negroes to vote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each of these Amendments vitally concerned the civil liberties of the people . They not only conferred political rights on the emancipated slaves . They also placed other new restraints on state action . For present purposes , the crucial provision is in Section 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment : " No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States ; nor shall any State deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . " It is apparent at once that the prohibition is limited to action by the States . ' " No State shall " are the words used . We will see later how im- portant that limitation is . Voluntary groups of citizens acting on their own and not under the sponsorship of a State are not barred from discriminatory conduct . The individual businessman , the individual property owner , the individual student ? these are all free to harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course some law of a State outlawing discrimination . It is only when citizens obtain the aid of a State in furthering their discriminatory practices that the Fourteenth Amendment is brought into play . It is only when a State acts to promote , to protect , to encourage the outlawed action that the guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment operates . A State acts through various agents ? sheriffs , posses , prosecutors , administrators , legislators , judges , governors and a host of other officials . Whatever the agency may be , the Fourteenth Amendment comes into operation , provided the agency acts for a State and does its bidding or effectuates its policy . See Shelley v. Kraemer , 334 U.S. 1 . Cases to be discussed later in the Lecture series will illustrate both the reach and the limitations of the concept of state action included in the Fourteenth Amendment . Prior to these Amendments the Constitution placed few restraints on state action . As previously noted , Article I , Section 10 barred the States from passing bills of attainder , ex post facto laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title of nobility , and from doing certain other acts touching on international and fiscal affairs of the Nation . But apart from those few restraints , the Constitution had not undertaken to place beyond the reach of state action any civil rights of the citizens . I stated earlier that the Bill of Rights placed restraints on the Federal Government , not on the state governments . That was the holding in the early case of Barron v. Baltimore , 7 Pet . 243 . In that case , it was contended that the provision of the Fifth Amendment which prohibits the taking of private property for public use without just compensation operated as a restraint on the States as well  | as on the Federal Government . Chief Justice Marshall , speaking for the Court , stated : " The constitution was ordained and established by the people of the United States for themselves , for their own government , and not for the government of the individual states . Each state established a constitution for itself , and , in that constitution , provided such limitations and restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictated . The people of the United States framed such a government for the United States as they supposed bast adapted to their situation , and best calculated to promote their interests . The powers they conferred on this government were to be exercised by itself ; and the limitations on power , if expressed in general terms , are naturally , and , we think , necessarily applicable to the government created by the instrument . They are limitations of power granted in the instrument itself ; not of distinct governments , framed by different persons and for different purposes . " Id. , 247 . There is persuasive evidence that when Congress wrote the Due Process Clause into the Fourteenth Amendment , the plan was to make the Bill of Rights applicable to the States . Justice Black has reviewed that history in his dissenting opinion in Adamson v. California , 332 U.S. 46 , 68 . This is not the place to relate that history . Certainly it is true that those who wrote the Due Process Clause into the Fourteenth Amendment were not writing on a clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Due process was both a substantive concept and a procedural concept . It meant that there were some things government could not do to man . It also meant that if government proceeded against a citizen , it had to proceed in a fair manner , avoiding certain indignities and certain unfair procedures . Illustrative of the former was freedom of conscience and religion . Illustrative of the latter were the right to counsel and to trial by jury . History and experience had hammered out remedies for and safeguards against certain abuses ; and they had been written into the law of the land . They were reflected in the Bill of Rights , a list of guaranties that was good for all times and seasons , for peace and war , for all political regimes . Why should not the Bill of Rights be taken as the  | definition of that due process which was guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment ? State and Nation would then be governed by the same code , when it came to civil rights . Due process would then have a rather specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fashioned by judges to suit their own tastes . An alternative was to take the primary meaning of Due Process from the Bill of Rights , allowing it to be added to as new experiences showed new grievances and the need for protection against an exploitive government . If these alternatives were rejected , then Due Process as used in the Fourteenth Amendment was wholly undefined . It would have such meaning as judges from time to time might give it . That had the advantage of great flexibility . But it also had inherent dangers . For Due Process , like Natural Law , could come to reflect the individual idiosyncrasies of the judge , his predilections , his favored economic creed or philosophical theory . The absence of guides or standards might allow judicial whim or caprice to play havoc with legislative programs . Though I have always thought that the Fourteenth Amendment made the Bill of Rights applicable to the States , a case can be made out against inclusion of the Bill of Rights in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . The Fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a person 's " life , liberty , or property without due process of law . " That clause must , therefore , mean less in the Fifth Amendment than it does in the Fourteenth , if in the latter it is given a scope so broad as to include all of the Bill of Rights . Moreover , some provisions of the Bill of Rights seemed to reflect petty preferences , not basic principles , as for example the right to jury trial in cases where the value in controversy exceeds twenty dollars . Experience convinced some that trial by judge might be preferred over trial by jury , at least in civil cases . The Fifth Amendment provides for presentment or indictment by grand jury in capital or other infamous cases . Some States had evolved a different practice , allowing prosecutions to be initiated on the information of the prosecutor . Students of criminal procedure often balked at the idea of requiring state prosecutions to be initiated by the grand jury route . And so the arguments were marshalled pro and con on the inclusion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fourteenth Amendment . To date the Court has never accepted the view that all of the guarantees of the Bill of Rights are applicable to the States as a result of the Fourteenth Amendment . Instead , the Court has pro- ceeded on a selective basis and has included or excluded those guarantees in light of its conception of " a scheme of ordered liberty . " Palko v. Connecticut , 302 U.S. 319 , 325 . In Hurtado v. California , 110 U.S. 516 , the Court held that use of an information in place of the grand jury indictment required in federal criminal cases by the Fifth Amendment was not a violation of Due Process when employed in state prosecutions . Maxwell v. Dow , 176 U.S. 581 , involved a challenge to the Utah system , whereby a criminal trial was conducted before a jury of eight members rather than the traditional twelve . The Court conceded that such a procedure in a federal court would violate the right to trial by jury contained in the Sixth Amendment . The Court held , however , that trial by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Due Process , at least in non-capital cases . In Twining v. New Jersey , 211 U.S. 78 , the trial court had commented on the failure of the accused to testify , and had permitted the jury to draw an unfavorable inference from this fact . This was said to violate the accused 's privilege against self-incrimination guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment . The question to be decided was phrased as follows by the Court : " Is it the privilege against self-incrimination a fundamental principle of liberty and justice which inheres in the very idea of free government and is the inalienable right of a citizen of such a government ? " Id. , 106 . The Court answered this question in the negative , holding that the privilege against self-incrimination , secured against federal action by the Fifth Amendment , was not secured against state action by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . Substantial segments of the Bill of Rights , however , have been held to be included in the concept of Due Process as used in the Fourteenth Amendment . One such guarantee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall not be taken for public use without just compensation . Chicago , B. &; Q. R. Co. v. Chicago , 166 U.S. 226 , held that that guarantee is applicable to the States , as well as to the Federal Government . In Gitlow v. New York , 268 U.S. 652 , decided in 1925 , the Court assumed , for purposes of the case before it , that freedom of speech and of the press were among the fundamental rights protected by the Due Process Clause from impairment by the States . The Court held ,  | however , that even if applicable , those guarantees had not been violated in the case at bar . A similar result was reached in Whitney v. California , 274 U.S. 357 , decided in 1927 . There the Court held that the California Criminal Syndicalism Act , which prohibited organization and membership in any group which advocated criminal syndicalism , was not a restraint on the rights of free speech and assembly and not repugnant to the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . In Fiske v. Kansas , 274 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitney case , the Court was confronted with a criminal syndicalism act of the State of Kansas . The Act had been applied to sustain a conviction without any charge or evidence that the organization in which the defendant secured members advocated any crime , violence , or other unlawful methods of effecting industrial or political change , and was therefore held invalid . The language of the Court was as follows : " Thus applied the Act is an arbitrary and unreasonable exercise of the police power of the State , unwarrantably infringing the liberty of the defendant in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . " Id. , 387 . Thus , by 1931 Chief Justice Hughes , speaking for the Court in Stromberg v. California , 238 U.S. 359 , could declare : " It has been determined that the conception of liberty under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment embraces the right of free speech . " Id. , 368 . In support of this proposition , he cited the Gitlow , Whitney , and Fiske cases to which I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forbade the displaying of any flag , badge , or banner as a sign , symbol or emblem of opposition to organized government . The state court had recognized the ambiguity of that prohibition , which might be construed to include peaceful and orderly opposition to a government by a political party out of power , including opposition by legal means and within constitutional limitations . The Court concluded : " The maintenance of the opportunity for free political discussion to the end that government may be responsive to the will of the people and that changes may be obtained by lawful means , an opportunity essential to the security of the Republic , is a fundamental principle of our constitutional system . A statute which upon its face , and as authoritatively construed , is so vague and indefinite as to permit the punishment of the fair use of this opportunity is repugnant to the guaranty of liberty contained in the Fourteenth Amendment . " Id. , 369.  | In the leading case of Near v. Minnesota , 283 U.S. 697 , the Due Process Clause was used to strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a state statute which permitted suppression of a newspaper or periodical as a public nuisance . The Court stated : " It is no longer open to doubt that the liberty of the press , and of speech , is within the liberty safeguarded by the clue process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from invasion by state action . " Id. , 707 . Incorporation of the First Amendment has not been limited to the guarantees of free speech and a free press , but extends to all of the basic freedoms secured by that Amendment . Thus , in DeJonge v. Oregon , 299 U.S. 353 , the Court struck down a criminal syndicalism law of the State of Oregon , under which a defendant had been convicted solely because he had assisted in the conduct of a public meeting held under the auspices of the Communist Party . The Court held that this violated freedom of assembly . The inclusion of this guarantee in the Due Process concept was explained as follows : " The right of peaceable assembly is a right cognate to those of free speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The very idea of a government , republican in form , implies a right on the part of its citizens to meet peaceably for consultation in respect to public affairs and to petition for a redress of grievances . ' " Id. , 364 . The guarantee of religious freedom and the prohibition against establishment of religion , contained in the First Amendment , are also included within the Due Process concept , as Murdock v. Pennsylvania , 319 U.S. 105 , and Everson v. Board of Education , 330 U.S. 1 , make clear . In the Murdock case , an attempt to impose a license fee on members of the Jehovah 's Witnesses religious sect engaged in distributing religious literature was held invalid as a restraint on religious freedom . In Everson , the Court declared that the " First Amendment , as made applicable to the states by the Fourteenth . . . commands that a state shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof .... " 330 U.S. 1 , 8.  | Other safeguards included in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the States through the development of the " concept of ordered liberty . " A leading case in the development of that concept was Powell v. Alabama , 287 U.S. 45 . In that case , certain Negroes had been convicted of rape and sentenced to death without being afforded effective assistance of counsel . The Court was presented with a claim that Due Process embraced the right to counsel . In determining this question , the Court considered the fact that at least twelve of the thirteen colonies had recognized the right to counsel in criminal prosecutions , though in one or two instances it was limited to the more serious offenses . The Court pointed out the importance of counsel in assuring the accused a fair hearing , and concluded : " . . . in a capital case , where the defendant is unable to employ counsel , and is incapable adequately of making his own defense because of ignorance , feeble mindedness , illiteracy , or the like , it is the duty of the court , whether requested or not , to assign counsel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that duty is not discharged by an assignment at such a time or under such circumstances as to preclude the giving of effective aid in the preparation and trial of the case . To hold otherwise would be to ignore the fundamental postulate . . . that there are certain immutable principles of justice which inhere in the very idea of free government which no member of the Union may disregard : " Id. , 71-72 . The Court , however , has refused to hold that the requirements of Due Process are coterminous with those of the Sixth Amendment . This view was stated as follows in Betts v. Brady , 316 U.S. 455 : . . . the Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the conviction and incarceration of one whose trial is offensive to the common and fundamental ideas of fairness and right , and while want of counsel in a particular case may result in a conviction lacking in such fundamental fairness , we can not say that the Amendment embodies an inexorable command that no trial for any offense , or in any court , can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented by counsel . " Id. , 473 . I shall defer a full discussion of the right to counsel to a subsequent Lecture . Suffice it to say at present that the right is applicable to proceedings in the courts of the States in the more serious criminal prosecutions . See Massey v. Moore , 348 U.S. 105 . Considerable litigation has centered about the problem of self- incrimination . In Adamson v. California , 332 U.S. 46 , the Court reaffirmed the views of Twining v. New Jersey , 211 U.S. 78 , to which I referred earlier , in holding that the Fifth Amendment 's guarantee against self-incrimination was not made applicable to the States by the Due Process Clause . The Adamson case involved a state law which permitted comment upon and inferences from the failure of the accused to testify . The Court held that this procedure slid not violate Due Process . Where , however , the process of self-incrimination is carried to the point of resorting to coerced confessions , the Court has held the Due Process guarantee to be violated . Brown v. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of confessions procured by extreme physical torture , including whipping and hanging . The State contended that this was merely an instance of self-incrimination which was not prohibited to the States by the Due Process Clause . The Court answered this contention as follows : " . . . the freedom of the State in establishing its policy is the freedom of constitutional government and is limited by the requirement of due process of law . Because a State may dispense with a jury trial , it does not follow that it may substitute trial by ordeal . The rack and torture chamber may not be substituted for the witness stand . . . . The due process clause requires that state action , whether through one agency or another , shall be consistent with the fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions . ' . . . It would be difficult to conceive of methods more revolting to the sense of justice than those taken to procure the confessions of these petitioners , and the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentence was a clear denial of due process . " Id. , 285-286 . A leading case is Chambers v. Florida , 309 U.S. 227 , where convictions of murder had been obtained by the use of coerced confessions , obtained as a result of protracted questioning " under circumstances calculated to break the strongest nerves and the stoutest resistance . " Id. , 238-239 . The Court , speaking through Justice Black , held that such inquisitorial methods were one of the evils which the Due Process Clause was clearly designed to prevent . A related problem was presented in Rochin v. California , 342 U.S. 165 . In that case , state officers entered the home of a suspected narcotics offender ; the latter thereupon put certain capsules in his mouth . After an unsuccessful attempt to extract them by force , an  | emetic was forced into the stomach of the suspect and he vomited up the capsules , which contained narcotics . The capsules were admitted into evidence over his objections ; and that was held to constitute a violation of Due Process . Further illustrations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Process Clause are furnished by Francis v. Resweber , 329 U.S. 459 , and In re Oliver , 333 U.S. 257 . In the former case , the petitioner had been convicted of murder and sentenced to death in the electric chair . The executioner threw the switch , but , presumably because of some mechanical difficulty , death did not result . The defendant claimed that further efforts to electrocute him would violate the prohibition of the Eighth Amendment against cruel and unusual punishment . The Court held that , assuming this prohibition to be included within the scope of Due Process , it had not been violated by the facts presented in that case . In re Oliver involved a conviction for contempt of court which had been obtained in the course of secret grand jury proceedings . The Court pointed out that , while secrecy was customary in the conduct of the investigative function of the grand jury , it was a far different matter to use such procedure in a trial arising out of those proceedings . The Court stated : " In view of this nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to freedom , and the universal requirement of our federal and state governments that criminal trials be public , the Fourteenth Amendment 's guarantee that no one shall be deprived of his liberty without due process of law means at least that an accused can not be thus sentenced to prison . " Id. , 273 . While the concept of ordered liberty has provided a basis for securing some measure of protection against state action , that concept has not proven sufficient to embrace several of the important guarantees of the Bill of Rights . Palko v. Connecticut , 302 U.S. 319 , involved a Connecticut statute which permitted appeals by the State in criminal cases upon questions of law which could , if successful , lead to a new trial . It was argued that this violated the Fifth Amendment 's prohibition of double jeopardy , made applicable to the States by the Due Process Clause . The Court held that , assuming this guarantee of the Fifth Amendment had been violated , there was still no denial of Due Process . justice Cardozo , speaking for the Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the statute has subjected him a hardship so acute and shocking that our polity will not endure it ? Does it violate those fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the  | base of all our civil and political institutions ' ? . . . The answer surely must be no . " ' Id. , 328 . In Brock v. North Carolina , 344 U.S. 424 , the trial judge declared a mistrial after two of the State 's ' witnesses refused to testify , pending the outcome of their own cases . Later , when the cases of the witnesses had been disposed of and they were available once more , a new trial of the defendant was held and lie was convicted . He claimed this form of double jeopardy violated the 1 ) ue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . But his claim was rejected by a majority of the Court , which held that the test laid down in Palko was satisfied , since the procedure did not violate the essence of a scheme of ordered justice . Cf. Singh v. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Weeks v. United States , 232 U.S. 383 , the Court had held that the provisions in the Fourth Amendment restricting search and seizure barred the use of evidence secured through illegal searches and seizures in prosecutions in federal courts . In Wolf v. Colorado , 338 U.S. Article 20 ( 2 ) of the Indian Constitution provides : " No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once . " The Supreme Court in Hussain v. Bombay , 16 Sup . Ct . Jour. 456 , held that this Article had its roots in the principle of " autrefois convict " or " double jeopardy . " The Court said : " The words before a Court of law or judicial tribunal ' are not to be found in Article 20 ( 2 ) . But if regard be had to the whole background indicated above it is clear that in order that the protection of Article 20 ( 2 ) be invoked by a citizen there must have been a prosecution and punishment in respect of the same offence before a Court of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matters in controversy judicially on evidence on oath which it must be authorised by law to administer and not before a tribunal which entertains a departmental or an administrative enquiry even though set up by a statute but not required to proceed on legal evidence given on oath . " Id. , 460-461 . In this case confiscation of gold illegally imported was held not to bar subsequent prosecution of the importer for the offense . The protection afforded by Article 20 ( 2 ) seems to be narrower than that embraced in the guarantee against double jeopardy contained in the United States Constitution . The Indian Supreme Court said in Venkataraman v. Union of India , 41 A.I.R . 375 , 377 : " In order to enable a citizen to invoke the protection of clause ( 2 ) of Article 20 of the Constitution , there must have been both prosecution and punishment in respect of the same offence . The words prosecuted and punished ' are to be taken not distributively so as to mean prosecuted or ' punished . Both the factors must co-exist in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The position is . .. different under the American Constitution . There the prohibition is not against a second punishment but against the peril in which a person may be placed by reason of a valid indictment being presented against him , before a competent court , followed by proper arraignment and plea and a lawful impanelling of the jury . It is not necessary to have a verdict at all . . . . In Kalawati v. Himachal Pradesh , 16 Sup . Ct . Jour. 144 , the Supreme Court of India rejected a claim that this provision bars an appeal from an acquittal .  | 25 , a closely divided Court refused to apply a similar rule to actions in state courts . It was conceded that security against arbitrary intrusion by the police is implicit in " the concept of ordered liberty " as embodied in the Due Process Clause , so that were a State affirmatively to sanction such action it would run counter to the guaranty of the Fourteenth Amendment . It was held , however , that Due Process does not forbid the admission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore , the effective sanction which the Weeks doctrine imposes as a means of discouraging such unlawful searches and seizures is not available in state court prosecutions , so far as the provisions of the Federal Constitution are concerned . Those guarantees that are protected against both state action and federal action are in a preferred position under our constitutional scheme . These include some substantive rights : freedom of speech freedom of the press freedom of religion freedom of assembly and compensation for property taken . They include also some procedural safeguards : the right to counsel in the more serious criminal cases the right to be free from coerced confessions the right to a public trial . Other basic rights may be added in the days ahead . What is included or excluded depends much on the attitude of the individual Justices . Justice Holmes once stated in popular terms that an act violates due process " if it makes you vomit . " He expressed the revulsion all of us feel at some actions of prosecutors , the police , and legislators . Due Process means as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet embrace all the guarantees of the Bill of Rights . It may never acquire that scope . But its expansion in the last twenty years to include all the First Amendment rights indicates the evolution it is undergoing and the prospects of its continuous growth and expansion as an instrument protective of the fundamental rights of man . As we have seen , the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was narrowly construed for a long time so as not to make the  | Bill of Rights binding on the States . But in another sense the Due Process Clause was rather broadly and liberally interpreted to place a heavy restraining hand on state legislatures . It seemed for a while that the Due Process Clause had given the Supreme Court powers comparable to a super-legislature . For the Court had so construed Due Process in a substantive sense as to curtail drastically the power of the States to legislate . " Santa Clara Co. v. Southern Pacific R. Co. , 118 U.S. 394 , decided in 1886 , was one starting point for development of ' that doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a " person " within the meaning of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . Earlier decisions had rejected the argument as being without substance . In Insurance Co. v. New Orleans , 1 Woods 85 , 88 , Circuit Judge Woods answered the contention as follows : " The word person occurs three times in the first section , in the following connections : All persons born or naturalized in the United States ' ? ' nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty or property , ' etc. nor ' shall any state deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws . ' The complainants claim that this last clause applies to corporations ? artificial persons . " Only natural persons can be born or naturalized ; only natural persons can be deprived of life or liberty ; so that it is clear that artificial persons are excluded from the provisions of the first two clauses just quoted . If we adopt the construction claimed by complainants , we must hold that the word person , ' where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wider and more comprehensive mean-  | ing than in the other clauses of the section where it occurs . This would be a construction for which we find no warrant in the rules of interpretation . The plain and evident meaning of the section is , that the persons to whom the equal protection of the law is secured are persons born or naturalized or endowed with life and liberty , and consequently natural and not artificial persons . " And see the dissent of Justice Black in Adamson v. California , 332 U.S. 46 , 68 . The Nation knew that it was the Negro , not the corporation , whose interests were to be protected by the Fourteenth Amendment . See especially the dissenting opinions in Connecticut General Co. v. Johnson , 303 U.S. 77 , 83 ; Wheeling Steel Corp v. Glander , 337 U.S. 562 , 576 ; Adamson v. California , 332 U.S. 46 , 68 . But the Chief Justice interrupted counsel during oral argument in the Santa Clara case to say , " The court does not wish to hear argument on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution , which forbids a State to deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws , applies to these corporations . We are all of opinion that it does . " 118 U.S. at 396 . A short time later , the Court held that corporations are " persons " within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . Minneapolis R. Co. v. Beckwith , 129 U.S. 26 , 28 . The way was now clear for corporate enterprises to protect themselves against reform legislation . When the practices of business made it essential to enact legislation for the protection of the public interest , the Fourteenth Amendment became a shield and a sword for protection of the vested interests . One notable area involved price regulation . In response to the demands of midwestern farmers , who were being subjected by the railroads to excessively high freight rates , state legislatures set maximum rates for storage of grain . In Munn v. Illinois , 94 U.S. 113 , the Court had taken a liberal view in favor of the validity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulate industries " affected with a public interest " was upheld , and the character of such business was broadly defined . The Court stated : " We know that this is a power which may be abused ; but that is no argument against its existence . For protection against abuses by legislatures the people must resort to the polls , not to the courts . " Id. , 134 . Shortly after the Court held that corporations were " persons " within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment , a series of inroads were made on the Munn doctrine .  | Chicago , M. &; St. P. R. Co. v. Minnesota , 134 U.S. 418 , involved a state statute which provided that the rates set by a state commission were to be final and conclusive on the question what are equal and reasonable charges . The statute was held to be invalid , and ratemaking started to become a judicial , not a legislative prerogative . A long chapter in ratemaking started in 1898 with Smyth v. Ames , 169 U.S. 466 . The details of that undertaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that the ratemaking formula set in Smyth v. Ames was to plague public regulation . It made the ratemaking process an almost endless affair , an expensive one , and established a procedure that was needlessly complicated . Sec the opinion of Justice Brandeis in Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. v. Public Service Commission , 262 U.S. 276 , 289 . And see Federal Power Commission v. Hope Natural Gas Co. , 320 U.S. 591 . It was well established that public utilities could have their rates fixed by public authorities . What about the prices charged by other businesses ? Tyson &; Bro. v. Banton , 273 U.S. 418 , involved a New York statute which forbade the resale of any theatre ticket at a price in excess of fifty cents above that printed on the face of such ticket . The Court held that only a narrow group of enterprises were subject to price regulation , and that theatre tickets were not included : " A business is not affected with a public interest merely because it is large or because the public are warranted in having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the interest meant such as arises from the mere fact that the public derives benefit , accommodation , ease or enjoyment from the existence or operation of the business ... . ... a business or property , in order to be affected with a public interest , must be such or be so employed as to justify the conclusion that it has been devoted to a public use and its use thereby , in effect , granted to the public . " Id. , 430 , 434 . In Williams v. Standard Oil Co. , 278 U.S. 235 , the Court held that the business of dealing in gasoline was not a business " affected with a public interest " and therefore not subject to price regulation by the States . The Court had held in Adams v. Tanner , 244 U.S. 590 , that a State could not forbid employment agents from receiving fees from the workers for whom they found employment . In Ribnik v. McBride , 277 U.S. 350 , the Court went further and held that a State could not even  | fix the fees which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority attempted to distinguish between price regulation and other types of regulation . Though the Court still spoke in terms of businesses " affected with a public interest , " the liberal view of that doctrine as announced in the Munn case was no longer applied . Perhaps the most extreme application of the Due Process Clause as a sword and a shield against social legislation occurred in the labor field . In the famous case of Lochner v. New York , 198 U.S. 45 , the Court held that regulation of working hours by the States was prohibited as an interference with " liberty of contract . " The majority held that the general right to make a labor contract was part of the " liberty " protected by the Due Process Clause , and that the statute in question interfered with this right . Justice Holmes delivered a dissent in which he vigorously attacked the Court 's efforts to fasten particular economic theories upon the country . I quote it at length because it was to become the majority view before many years passed . " This case is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country does not entertain . If it were a question whether I agreed with that theory , I should desire to study it further and long before making up my mind . But I do not conceive that to be my duty , because I strongly believe that my agreement or disagreement has nothing to do with the right of a majority to embody their opinions in law . It is settled by various decisions of this court that state constitutions and state laws may regulate life in many ways which we as legislators might think as injudicious or if you like as tyrannical as this , and which equally with this interfere with the liberty to contract . Sunday laws and usury laws are ancient examples . A more modern one is the prohibition of lotteries . The liberty of the citizen to do as he likes so long as he does not interfere with the liberty of others to do the same , which has been a shibboleth for some well-known writers , is interfered with by school laws , by the Post Office , by every state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desirable , whether he likes it or not . The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr. Herbert Spencer 's Social Statics. . . . a constitution is not intended to embody a particular economic theory , whether of paternalism and the organic relation of the citizen to the State or of laissez faire . It is made for people of fundamentally differing views , and the accident of our finding certain opinions natural and familiar or novel and even shocking ought not to conclude our judgment upon  | the question whether statutes embodying them conflict with the Constitution of the United States . " General propositions do not decide concrete cases . The decision will depend on a judgment or intuition more subtle than any articulate major premise . But I think that the proposition just stated , if it is accepted , will carry us far toward the end . Every opinion tends to become a law . I think that the word liberty in the Fourteenth Amendment is perverted when it is held to prevent the natural outcome of a dominant opinion , unless it can be said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statute proposed would infringe fundamental principles as they have been understood by the traditions of our people and our law . It does not need research to show that no such sweeping condemnation can be passed upon the statute before us . A reasonable man might think it a proper measure on the score of health . Men whom I certainly could not pronounce unreasonable would uphold it as a first instalment of a general regulation of the hours of work . " Id. , 75-76 . The same fate met attempts to set minimum wages . In Adkins v. Children 's Hospital , 261 U.S. 525 , the Court held that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment prevented regulation by Congress of minimum wages for women in the District of Columbia . The Court turned once more to " liberty of contract , " explaining : " In making such contracts , generally speaking , the parties have an equal right to obtain from each other the best terms they can as the result of private bargaining . " Id. , 545 . The Adkins decision was applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fourteenth Amendment , in Morehead v. New York , 298 U.S. 587 . The Clause was also used to frustrate efforts of labor to perfect its strength through organized , disciplined unions , as illustrated by Adair v. United States , 208 U.S. 161 , and Coppage v. Kansas , 236 U.S. 1 . In Adair , the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment was used to strike down an Act of Congress which attempted to outlaw discrimination by interstate carriers against those employees who engaged in union activities . An employee had been discharged because of his union activities , in violation of the Act . In explaining why such legislation was invalid , the Court stated : " It was the legal right of the defendant Adair ? however unwise such a course might have been ? to discharge Coppage because of his being a member of a labor organization , as it was the legal right of Coppage ,  | if he saw fit to do so ? however unwise such a course on his part might have been ? to quit the service in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were not members of a labor organization . In all such particulars the employer and the employe have equality of right , and any legislation that disturbs that equality is an arbitrary interference with the liberty of contract which no government can legally justify in a free land . " 208 U.S. at 175 . In Coppage , Kansas had sought to outlaw the notorious " yellow-dog contract , " under which an employee was compelled to agree not to become a member of any labor organization as a condition of obtaining and maintaining employment . Such contracts had served to curtail the growth of labor organizations , for the individual employee was in no position to resist the demands of an employer who requested such a contract . The following is indicative of the Court 's attitude toward labor organizations in that era : " The Act . . . is intended to deprive employers of a part of their liberty of contract , to the corresponding advantage of the employed and the upbuilding of the labor organizations . But no attempt is made , or could reasonably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations , any more than other voluntary associations of persons , as a legitimate object for the exercise of the police power . They are not public institutions , charged by law with public or governmental duties , such as would render the maintenance of their membership a matter of direct concern to the general welfare . " 236 U.S. at 16-17 . Rate regulation and employer-employee relations were not the only areas in which the Court used the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to strike down state laws regulating business and industrial practices . A state statute , aimed at chain stores , forbade a corporation from owning a drug store unless the stockholders were licensed pharmacists . That law was struck down in Liggett Co. v. Baldridge , 278 U.S. 105 . A state statute attempting to limit the number of ice dealers in a given area met a similar fate . New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann , 285 U.S. 262 . See also Allgeyer v. Louisiana , 165 U.S. 578 ; Wolff Packing Co. v. Court of Industrial Relations , 262 U.S. 522 . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best illustrates the extreme to which the Court went in invalidating legislation under the Fourteenth Amendment . A Nebraska statute prescribed the minimum weights of loaves of bread ; and , in order to prevent the palming off of smaller for larger sizes , it fixed maximum as well as minimum tolerances . This was intended to prevent a loaf of one class from being  | increased in size until it could be sold for a loaf of the next larger standard size . The Court considered the merits of the measure as a means of preventing fraud ( an end which was concededly legitimate ) and determined that a better means should have been found to effectuate the legislative intent . Therefore , the measure was held invalid . Justices Brandeis and Holmes dissented , pointing out : " To decide , as a fact , that the prohibition of excess weights is not necessary for the protection of the purchasers against imposition and fraud by short weights ' ; that it is not calculated to effectuate that purpose ' ; and that it subjects bakers and sellers of bread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an exercise of the powers of a super-legislature ? not the performance of the constitutional function of judicial review . " Id. , 534 . Beginning in the 1930 's , the Court gradually desisted from using the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to defeat social legislation . Precedents were overruled , their underlying philosophy was rejected , and the liberal attitude first voiced in Munn v. Illinois , 94 U.S. 113 , was once more adopted . One of the first areas to witness the change was that of price regulation . In Tagg Bros. v. United States , 280 U.S. 420 , it was held that an Act of Congress which provided for regulation of the charges of commission agents at stockyards did not violate the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment . O'Gorman &; Young v. Hartford Ins . Co. , 282 U.S. 251 , upheld the power of the States to regulate insurance rates . Justice Brandeis , who had dissented from the earlier restrictive views of the Court , delivered the majority opinion for a closely divided Court , which held that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest that the State might regulate its rates . New York sought to prevent destructive price-cutting in the milk industry by setting minimum prices for the sale of milk . This provision was challenged as a violation of Due Process . The Court upheld the provision , rejecting the contention that price regulation was to be regarded as particularly suspect . Nebbia v. New York , 291 U.S. 502 . In adopting a liberal view of the class of businesses affected with a public interest , the Court stated : " If the law-making body within its sphere of government concludes that the conditions or practices in an industry make unrestricted competition an inadequate safeguard of the consumer 's interests , produce waste harmful to the public , threaten ultimately to cut off the supply of  | a commodity needed by the public , or portend the destruction of the industry itself , appropriate statutes passed in an honest effort to correct the threatened consequences may not be set aside because the regulation adopted fixes prices reasonably deemed by the legislature to be fair to those engaged in the industry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where , as here , the economic maladjustment is one of price , which threatens harm to the producer at one end of the series and the consumer at the other . The Constitution does not secure to anyone liberty to conduct his business in such fashion as to inflict injury upon the public at large , or upon any substantial group of the people . Price control , like any other form of regulation , is unconstitutional only if arbitrary , discriminatory , or demonstrably irrelevant to the policy the legislature is free to adopt , and hence an unnecessary and unwarranted interference with individual liberty . " Id. , 538-539 . In Olsen v. Nebraska , 313 U.S. 236 , a Nebraska statute limiting the fees which could be charged by private employment agencies was upheld , and Ribnik v. McBride , 277 U.S. 350 , was overruled . A similar approach was adopted in regard to legislation dealing with employer-employee relations . A statute of the State of Washington which set minimum wages for women was upheld in West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish , 300 U.S. 379 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nebraska constitutional amendment and a North Carolina statute provided that no person should be denied an opportunity to obtain or retain employment because he was or was not a member of a labor organization . These " right-to-work " statutes forbade employers to enter into " closed shop " agreements , obligating themselves to exclude persons from employment because they were not members of labor unions . The Court , rejecting the views of Coppage and Adair , refused to strike down these measures as violative of Due Process . Lincoln Union v. Northwestern Iron Co. , 335 U.S. 525 . In Asbury Hospital v. Cass County , 326 U.S. 207 , a statute of North Dakota required corporations , owning farm land not reasonably necessary in the conduct of their business , to dispose of it within ten years after the effective date of the Act . A foreign corporation owning farm land , which it had acquired prior to the Act , challenged the validity of the statute . The Court upheld the statute . California Automobile Assn. v. Maloney , 341 U.S. 105 , involved a state statute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pate in a plan for apportioning applicants for automobile liability insurance who were unable to obtain such insurance through ordinary channels . One insurance company , which was engaged in writing insurance for members of an automobile club having a select membership , complained that the plan would require it to write insurance for nonmembers who were poor risks , thereby violating the Due Process Clause . The plan had been adopted to enable certain persons who would not otherwise be able to comply with the State 's financial responsibility laws to obtain insurance which , in some cases , was a prerequisite to the operation of motor vehicles iii the State . This statute was also upheld . The present attitude of the Court toward the Due Process Clause is illustrated by Day-Brite Lighting , Inc. v. Missouri , 342 U.S. 421 . In that case the Court upheld a Missouri statute which provided that any employee , entitled to vote , might absent himself , on election days , from his employment for four hours , while the polls were open , and that it would be unlawful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court stated : " The public welfare is a broad and inclusive concept . The moral , social , economic , and physical well-being of the community is one part of it ; the political well-being , another . The police power which is adequate to fix the financial burden for one is adequate for the other . The judgment of the legislature that time out for voting should cost the employee nothing may be a debatable one . It is indeed conceded by the opposition to be such . But if our recent cases mean anything , they leave debatable issues as respects business , economic , and social affairs to legislative decision . We could strike down this law only if we returned to the philosophy of the Lochner , Coppage , and Adkins cases . " Id. , 424 425 . And see Williamson v. Lee Optical , 348 U.S. 483 . This does not mean that legislators have carte blanche , that the States can enact any laws they choose , that there are no limits to regulation . While the Court these days does not strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or inexpedient , it stands ready to act once the outside limits have been breached . What those limits are is impossible to define , except in terms of the concrete . And the illustrations to date are rare because of the liberality of the present Court in applying the test of constitutionality to social legislation . When social legislation alone is considered , that is to say , legislation touching on economic , business , community or fiscal matters , the Court since its  | reconstitution under Roosevelt beginning in 1937 , has struck down no such laws , national or local , on the ground of unconstitutionality under the Due Process Clause . Tot v. United States , 319 U.S. 463 , comes close enough , however , to that classification to warrant mention . It was not a case touching on social legislation , in the sense of Munn v. Illinois and the later cases , already discussed . It involved The Federal Firearms Act , which made it a crime for a person who had been convicted of a crime of violence or who was a fugitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shipped in interstate commerce . The critical provision of the Act stated that " the possession of a firearm or ammunition by any such person shall be presumptive evidence " that the firearm or ammunition was shipped in interstate commerce . 15 U.S.C. ? 902 ( f ) . Tot , who had a criminal record in the state courts , was found in New Jersey in possession of a pistol manufactured in Connecticut and shipped by the factory to Illinois . There was no evidence that Tot had received the pistol from an interstate shipment . Unless he had so received it , the federal prosecution would fail . The government , therefore , relied on the presumption stated in the statute . Tot was convicted and his conviction was set aside . ' ' Due process , said the Court , requires that " there he a rational connection between the facts proved and the fact presumed . " Id. , 467. " . . . where the inference is so strained as not to have a reasonable relation to the circumstances of life as we know them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a rule governing the procedure of courts . " Id. , 468 . Due process in the United States continues to have a substantive , as well as a procedural significance . The judiciary is committed to protect the citizen against arbitrary and capricious acts of both the federal and the state legislatures . But the zone for legislative action , though not limitless , is broad . The judiciary no longer sits as a super-legislature . The judiciary no longer undertakes to measure the constitutionality of legislation by the standards or requirements of any particular school of economic thought .  | We have seen how the Due Process Clause was used to curtail the power of the States to pass reform legislation , aimed at protecting the citizen against abusive practices of business groups . It seemed at times that another clause of the Fourteenth Amendment might be used with the same devastating effect . That result was , indeed , avoided by only the narrowest of margins . The Fourteenth Amendment provides that , " No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The words " privileges " and " immunities " are not defined . What is their reach ? A case from Louisiana put the problem squarely and directly , shortly after the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified . The legislature of Louisiana ( under the influence of the " carpet bag " government imported from the North to rule the State in the turbulent days following the Civil War ) passed a statute granting to one company a monopoly of the slaughterhouse business in certain parishes , including the City of New Orleans . This law deprived about 1,000 persons of the right to engage in that business . The right of a State to establish such a monopoly had been challenged in the legislature . The battle that was lost there was transferred to the courts , and finally reached the Supreme Court in 1873 in the famous Slaughter-House Cases , 16 Wall . 36 . Prior to the Fourteenth Amendment , Louisiana could have created a monopoly of one business or another as she chose . It was claimed that the Fourteenth Amendment barred such action . The right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was argued , was a " privilege " of a citizen ; and one of his " immunities " was the right to be free of state-created monopolies . If the claim was correct , then each citizen had an undefined set of " privileges " and " immunities , " newly protected against state action . The Court rejected that broad construction , pointing out that it would seriously disturb the balance between State and Nation , constitute a great " departure from the structure and spirit of our institutions , " " fetter and degrade the State governments by subjecting them to the control of Congress , in the exercise of powers heretofore universally conceded to them of the most ordinary and fundamental character , " and radically change " the whole theory of the relations of the State and Federal governments to each other and of both these governments to the people . " Id. , 78.  | The privileges or immunities , guaranteed against State action , are not " those which belong to citizens of the States as such . " Id. , 78 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunities " " which owe their existence to the Federal government , its National character , its Constitution , or its laws . " Id. , 79 . Those federal rights include the right to go to the seat of government and seek its protection ( Crandall v. Nevada , 6 Wall . 35 ) , the right to free movement interstate ( cf. Edwards v. California , 314 U.S. 160 ) , the right to habeas corpus , the right to protection on the high seas or in a foreign nation , the right to freedom from slavery . Slaughter-House Cases , 16 Wall . 79-80 . But the rights of citizens deriving from state laws are not " privileges " or " immunities " within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment . So held the Court by a narrow margin of five to four in the SlaughterHouse Cases . And by so holding it kept the equilibrium between state and federal government from being drastically altered by the Fourteenth Amendment . Charles Warren , II The Supreme Court in United States History ( 1937 ) , 542-543 , wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in accord with the temper of the times . The country was tiring of the extensions , and , in some circumstances , usurpations of Federal power which had been the natural outcome of war and of war necessities . The decision marked the end of the great centralizing , Nationalistic movement , and the beginning of a reaction towards the enhancement of the powers of the States . " The protection sought by the businessmen of Louisiana under the Privileges and Immunities Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was also denied under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses . So it was that the sovereignty of the States was protected by the narrowest of margins . Had the minority in the Slaughter-House Cases prevailed , the alteration in the American federal system would have been as basic as it would be in India if the items on the State List were transferred to the Concurrent List . The judicial definition of the " privileges or immunities " of national citizenship has been a rather narrow one . " The broad definition advo- cated by the minority in the Slaughter-House Cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied that protection : the right to practice law in a state court ( Bradwell v. State , 16 Wall . 130 ) ; the Eighth Amendment 's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment ( In re Kemmler , 136 U.S. 436 ) ; the Seventh Amendment 's guarantee of a jury trial in civil cases ( Walker v. Sauei , uet , 92 U.S. 90 ) ; the Second Amendment 's right of the people to bear arms ( Presser v. Illinois , 116 U.S. 252 ) ; the Fifth and Sixth Amendments ' requirements of jury trial in criminal cases and prosecution by indictment ( Maxwell v. Dow , 176 U.S. 581 ) ; the right to sell liquor ( Barlemeyer v. Iowa , 18 Wall . 129 ) ; the right to suffrage ( Minor v. Ilappersett , 21 Wall . 162 ; Breedlove v. Suttles , 302 U.S. 277 ) ; the right to display the flag for advertising ( Halter v. Nebraska , 205 U.S. 34 ) ; the privilege against self-incrimination in state proceedings ( Twining v. New Jersey , 211 U.S. 78 ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waugh v. Board , 237 U.S. 589 ) ; the right to graze sheep on public lands ( Omaechevarria v. Idaho , 246 U.S. 343 ) ; the right to inheritance , free of death taxes ( Maxwell v. Bugbee , 250 U.S. 525 ) ; the right to attend a state university ( Hamilton v. Regents , 293 U.S. 245 ) ; the right to membership in an oath-bound association ( Bryant v. Zimmerman , 278 U.S. 63 ) ; the right to avoid double jeopardy in state court trials ( Palko v. Connecticut , 302 U.S. 319 ) ; and the right to run for state office ( Snowden v. Hughes , 321 U.S. 1 ) . In Hague v. C. I. O. , 307 U.S. 496 , a few members of the Court expressed the view that freedom to disseminate information concerning the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act , a federal statute , and to assemble peaceably for discussion of the Act , was a privilege or immunity of a citizen of the United States secured by the Fourteenth Amendment . Justice Stone protested that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immunities . His fears doubtless stemmed from Colgate v. Harvey , 296 U.S. 404 , decided in 1935 , holding that the right of a citizen of the United States to engage in business , including the making of loans of money in States other than his State of residence , is a privilege or immunity of national citizenship protected against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment . The Colgate case resident sellers ) ; Blake v. McClung , 172 U.S. 239 ( priority to local creditors ) ; Chalker v. Birmingham &; N. W. R. Co. , 249 U.S. 522 ( tax rate based on whether taxpayer has chief office in the State ) ; Travis v. Yale &; Towne Mfg . Co. , 252 U.S. 60 ( tax exemptions allowed to residents only ) ; Mullaney v. Anderson , 342 U.S. 415 ( license fee on non-resident fishermen ten times that on residents ) .  | struck down a Vermont law , taxing interest on money loaned outside Vermont , while exempting interest on loans made within the State . The privilege of acquiring , owning , and receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a privilege of federal citizenship . The alarms sounded by Justice Stone in his dissent were not false ones . If the doctrine of the Colgate case had prevailed , the ground lost under the Due Process Clause might well have been regained under the Privileges and Immunities Clause . But the Colgate case was short-lived , being overruled in 1940 by Madden v. Kentucky , 309 U.S. 83 , which held that such financial activities were not privileges of national citizenship . And see Snowden v. Hughes , 321 U.S. 1 . Today , therefore , the Court stands firmly with the majority view in the Slaughter-House Cases . While the Constitution of India does not contain a Due Process Clause , it does contain limitations on arbitrary legislative action in the area of social legislation by virtue of Article 19 ( 1 ) ( g ) , which provides that all citizens shall have the right to carry on any profession , trade , or business , subject to the reasonable restrictions provided for in Article 19 ( 6 ) . And see Article 19 ( 1 ) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the decision of the Supreme Court of India in Hussain v. District Board , 41 A.I.R . 630 . In the Hussain case , the operator of a cattle market challenged the validity of a local regulation which prohibited the operation of cattle markets . The Court held the regulation void as a violation of Article 19 ( 1 ) ( g ) . The Court relied on its earlier decision in Ahmed v. Municipal Board , 13 Sup . Ct . Jour. 324 , which held that a local regulation granting a monopoly in the wholesale vegetable business and thereby preventing a would-be dealer from carrying on such business violated Article 19 ( 1 ) ( g ) . And see Bombay v. Balsara , 14 Sup . Ct . Jour. 478 ; Yasin v. Town Area Committee , 15 Sup . Ct . Jour. 162 ; Rajasthan v. Nath Mal , 41 A.I.R . ( S. C. ) 307 . Thus the result reached in the Ahmed case on the basis of Article 19 ( 1 ) ( g ) was analogous to that which was sought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that advanced in the latter case  | In the latter 1940 's , it appears that the Government of Uttar Pradesh decided to run its own buses on public thoroughfares , and eventually decided to establish a state monopoly in this area . At first , an attempt was made to achieve this result under the Motor Vehicles Act , which provided for permits to operate such vehicles . Pursuant to that plan , the transport authorities began to cancel and refuse permits to private operators . In Moti Lal v. Uttar Pradesh , 38 A.I.R . 257 , the High Court of Allahabad held that such nationalization of an industry was not possible by mere executive action without supporting legislation . Thereafter , the state government passed legislation designed to authorize such a state monopoly of road transport , and the validity of this legislation came before the Supreme Court of India in Ahmad v. Uttar Pradesh , 17 Sup . Ct . Jour. 819 . After this law became effective , Article 19 was amended so that it now expressly permits nationalization The Court proceeded to decide whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraint on the rights of private bus operators to carry on their trade . In holding that the monopoly was not such a reasonable restriction , the Court stated : " In order to judge whether State monopoly is reasonable or not , regard .. . must be had to the facts of each particular case .... " Id. , 830 . One factor which was regarded as of importance in the case was that many private bus operators would be put out of business and deprived of a chance at a livelihood without receiving any compensation , thus violating the spirit of Article 39 ( a ) of the Directive Principles . A contention that the legislation conflicted with Article 1415 by dis- criminating in favor of the State was rejected . But the Court held that , while no tangible property was being taken , the Government was depriving the bus operators of the business of running buses on public roads , and therefore the legislation conflicted with Article 31 ( 2 ) as a taking of property without compensation . The Supreme Court of India has not applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus in Bharucha v. Commissioner , 17 Sup . Ct . Jour. 246 , a state law , regulating the liquor business , gave the Commissioner authority to grant licenses for the manufacture or sale of liquor , to restrict the number of establishments , and to license them by auction to the highest bidder . One who lost out to the highest bidder on the sale of a license to a liquor shop contended that the law deprived him of the right guaranteed by Article 19 ( 1 ) ( g ) of the Constitution . The Court sustained the law as a " reasonable " regulation under Article 19 ( 6 ) . The fact that the law created a monopoly did not per se make it invalid . ( 1 ) Since the liquor business was involved , there was great leeway for regulation because of its special dangers . ( 2 ) The monopoly was created after public auction . In Bijay Cot-ton Mills v. Ajmer , 18 Sup . Ct . Jour. 51 , it was contended that minimum wage legislation conflicted with the fundamental rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as guaranteed by Article 19 ( 1 ) ( g ) . It was argued that the Government was free , under the Act , to set arbitrary wage scales which could not be further challenged , and that such wages could force even well-meaning employers out of business . The Court , speaking through Justice Mukherjea , upheld the validity of the legislation as reasonably imposed in the public interest under Article 19 ( 6 ) . The object of the Act , viz. , the securing of living wages needed for health and decency , was said to be clearly valid . Any restraint the Act imposed on freedom of contract was held not to be unreasonable . The Court ruled that hardship in the case of individual employers would not render the Act invalid . The machinery for setting wages , which included provision for advisory bodies representing employers , employees , and the public , was held to afford adequate safeguards against hasty or capricious action . Lack of provision for further review of the Government 's decision , the Court said , would not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights protected by the United States Constitution include security of property as well as of the person . As I have already pointed  | out , the prohibition against the taking of property by the government except for public purposes and upon payment of just compensation is one of the preferred rights secured against the Federal Government by the Fifth Amendment " . . . nor shall private property be taken for public use , without just compensation " and against state governments by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment . The question of what constitutes a taking was considered in the Legal Tender Cases , 12 Wall . 457 , in which congressional enactments declaring treasury notes legal tender were upheld , as applied to debts contracted before and since the passage of the Acts . In rejecting a claim that this constituted a taking within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment , the Court stated that that guarantee only applied to a direct appropriation , and not to " consequential injuries resulting from the exercise of lawful power . " Id. , 551 . " A new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war may inevitably bring upon individuals great losses ... . But whoever supposed that , because of this , a tariff could not be changed , or a non-intercourse act , or an embargo be enacted , or a war be declared ? " Id. , 551 . The distinction between a taking and consequential injuries is sometimes difficult to make . On the one hand are regulatory measures which affect the value of property ? laws which zone an area , prohibiting certain types of buildings ; laws which set maximum hours of work and minimum wages ; laws which fix the price or the rate which may be charged . All such social legislation affects values . But such laws are nonetheless constitutional . See Federal Power Commission v. Hope Gas Co. , 320 U.S. 591 , 601 . One other extreme are cases where the Government has asserted an authority over the property that amounts to a kind of servitude . In United States v. Dickinson , 331 U.S. 745 , the property owner was held entitled to compensation for the permanent flooding of his land by virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a river . The Court stated the test as follows : " Property is taken in the constitutional sense when inroads are made upon an owner 's use of it to an extent that , as between private parties , a servitude has been acquired either by agreement or in course of time . " Id. , 748 . In United States v. Causby , 328 U.S. 256 , military planes from a nearby airport skimmed regularly over a nearby chicken farm and seriously impaired the farm 's use . The Court held that this constituted a taking of property within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment , pointing out that such interference with surface use by repeated low altitude  | flights caused as substantial an invasion of the owner 's property interests as would interference at the surface level of the land . The extent to which the Court has gone in requiring compensation is indicated by United States v. General Motors Corp. , 323 U.S. 373 , where compensation was required for the temporary occupancy of a portion of a leased building held by a tenant under a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifth Amendment was said to denote the group of rights inhering in the citizen 's relation to the physical thing , as the right to possess , use and dispose of it . That interest is compensable , whether it be the fee simple or an estate for years . " The constitutional provision is addressed to every sort of interest the citizen may possess , " said the Court . Id. , 378 . The Indian Constitution also guarantees property rights . The interpretation of their scope is of special importance in the development of the vast programs for land reform and economic development which the Government has under way . As previously noted , Article 19 ( 1 ) ( f ) provides : " All citizens shall have the right . . . to acquire , hold and dispose of property .... " But this right is qualified by Article 19 ( 5 ) which permits the State to impose " reasonable restrictions " on this right " in the interests of the general public or for the protection of the interests of any Scheduled Tribe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided in part : " ( 1 ) No person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law . " ( 2 ) No property , movable or immovable , including any interest in , or in any company owning , any commercial or industrial undertaking , shall be taken possession of or acquired for public purposes under any law authorising the taking of such possession or such acquisition , unless the law provides for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired and either fixes the amount of the compensation , or specifies the principles on which , and the manner in which , the compensation is to be determined and given . ( Italics added. ) " ( 3 ) No such law as is referred to in clause ( 2 ) made by the Legislature of a State shall have effect unless such law , having been reserved for the consideration of the President , has received his assent . " Article 31 ( 4 ) exempts from the provisions of 31 ( 2 ) certain pending legislation ; and 31 ( 6 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Additional exemptions are contained in Article 31 ( 5 ) . Articles 31A and 31B were added by the 1951 Amendments to the Indian Constitution , as a means of facilitating land reform measures , which were threatened by judicial interpretation of Article 31 . For legislation was closely scrutinized to see if it involved a taking for a public purpose , provided for proper compensation , and involved the type of acquisition contemplated by Article 31 . See Singh v. Bihar , 37 A.I.R . ( Pat. ) 392 . These new Articles state that no law providing for acquisition by the State of any estate or right therein or for extinguishment or modification of such rights shall be held void as infringing any fundamental rights as , for example , those guaranteed by Article 19 . They further provide that such laws , when passed by state legislatures , must receive the assent of the President . But after the Amendments , as well as before , compensation must be paid for any property taken . Thus while the 1951 Amendments curtailed the area of justiciable controversy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role of the courts as guardians of property rights . In Bihar v. Singh , 15 Sup . Ct . Jour. 354 , the Supreme Court of India held that the state legislature had exceeded its powers to fix compensation , under Item 42 of List III , by a colorable exercise of those powers in creating artificial deductions which were no really designed to fix compensation but rather to deprive persons of their property without payment of compensation . A leading Indian case on what constitutes a taking is West Bengal v. Gopal , 41 A.I.R . 92 , decided by the Supreme Court . A Bengal law was enacted which operated retrospectively to restrict the rights of a purchaser of land to evict undertenants . Chief Justice Patanjali Sastri stated that the term " taken possession of or acquired " in Article 31 ( 2 ) covers only an appropriation or abridgment which amounts to a deprivation of ownership . The test suggested was whether a statute withheld the property from the possession and enjoyment of the owner or seriously impaired its use or enjoyment by him , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court held that the legislation was in line with traditional tenancy legislation , affording relief to tenants , and did not amount to a deprivation of property under Article 31.  | In Ahmad v. Uttar Pradesh , 17 Sup . Ct . Jour. 819 , to which I referred earlier , a state monopoly of motor transport was held to infringe rights of private bus operators under Article 31 ( 2 ) . In Shrinivas v. Sholapur Spinning &; Weaving Co. , 17 Sup . Ct . Jour. 175 , the government of Bombay took over a cotton mill , in the sense that it appointed new directors who undertook the management of the mill . The reason was the desire to keep up production of an essential commodity and avoid serious unemployment . The new management passed a resolution making a call on the preference shares . A preference shareholder sued , challenging the validity of the law under which the government took over the mill . The Supreme Court held this was a taking of property within the meaning of Article 31 ( 2 ) of the Constitution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guise of superintendence the State is carrying on the business or trade for which the company was incorporated with the capital of the company .... " Id. , 183 . The purpose was held to be a " public purpose , namely , to keep the labour going and contented and to maintain the supply of essential commodity . " Id. , 183 . But the seizure could not be constitutionally consummated without payment of compensation as provided in Article 31 ( 2 ) . Justice Mahajan stated that Article 31 " gives complete protection to private property as against executive action , no matter by what process a person is deprived of possession of it . . . . It is immaterial to the person who is deprived of property as to what use the State makes of his property or what title it acquires in it . . . . In the present case nothing has been left with the company but the mere husk of title . " Id. , 189 , 190 . In Rajasthan v. Nath Mal , 17 Sup . Ct . Jour. 404 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks of food grains held by any person , so as not to allow the food grains to be sold without consent of the government . This regulation was held not to violate Article 19 ( 1 ) ( g ) of the Constitution . But the Court went on to hold unconstitutional a provision of the law that " such stocks shall also be liable to be requisitioned or disposed of under orders of the said authority at the rate fixed for purposes of Government procurement . " This provision left it entirely to the government " to requisition the stocks at any rate fixed by it and to dispose of such stocks at any rate in its discretion . " Id. , 406 . " The present is a typical case which illustrates how the business of a grain dealer can be paralysed , for it is admitted that while the Govern- ment procurement rate is Rs. 9 a maund , the market rate was Rs. 17 or Rs. 18 per maund , with the result that the stock holder suffered nearly cent . per cent . loss , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 ? 4 per maund on the stock requisitioned . " Id. , 407 . The provision therefore violated Article 31 ( 2 ) of the Constitution . In India , as in America , the question whether the taking is for a public purpose is a justiciable question . Berman v. Parker , 348 U.S. 26 , involved the validity of an Act of Congress , which provided for the condemnation of property in blighted areas of the District of Columbia so as to eliminate and prevent slum and substandard lousing conditions . In upholding this legislation , the Court stated that the task of determining public purposes was primarily one for the legislature , with the judiciary exercising an extremely narrow power of review to determine whether the requirements of the Fifth Amendment had been met . " The concept of the public welfare is broad and inclusive .... The values it represents are spiritual as well as physical , aesthetic as well as monetary . It is within the power of the legislature to determine that the community should be beautiful as well as healthy , spacious as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Id. , 33 . Except where restricted by the express terms of Articles 31 , 31A and 31B , the Indian courts also pass on the question of public purpose . In Singh v. Vindhya Pradesh , 41 A.I.R . 24 , the J. C. 's Court of Vindhya Pradesh passed on the constitutionality of a law providing for the acquisition of Mahua trees . The Court determined that such acquisition was for a public purpose , saying that the Mahua tree is " not merely just a piece of private property , but one of general public utility , especially in times of famine . " Id. , 29 . A recent leading case is Bombay v. Munji , 18 Sup . Ct . Jour. 10 . First of all , the Court held that Article 19 ( 1 ) ( f ) does not apply to cases where there is a total deprivation of property . In such cases , Article 31 alone must be relied on , and this is true even though some formal semblance of title remains . In that case , the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken , and this was held to bring Article 31 , rather than Article 19 ( 1 ) ( f ) , into play . " What is left , " said the Court , " is but the mere husk of title in the leasehold interest : a forlorn  | hope that the force of this law will somehow expend itself before the lease runs out . " Id. , 12 . The Court then considered the problem of public purpose , and held that that requirement had been met since the legislation was designed to " house the homeless . " ... the housing situation in Bombay was acute , largely due to the influx of refugees . Questions of public decency , public morals , public health and the temptation to lawlessness and crime , which such a situation brings in its train , at once arose ; and the public conscience was aroused on the ground of plain humanity . A race of proprietors in the shape of rapacious landlords who thrived on the misery of those who could find no decent roof over their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was threatened because Government servants could not find proper accommodation . Milder efforts to cope with the evil proved ineffective . It was necessary therefore for Government to take more drastic steps and in doing so they acted for the public weal . There was consequently a clear public purpose and an undoubted public benefit . " Id. , 13 . In carrying out this public purpose , considerable leeway must be left to the Government agencies concerned , said the Court , an attitude reflected by our own Supreme Court in Berman v. Parker , 348 U.S. 26 . When there is a taking for a public purpose , the question remains whether adequate provision has been made for compensation . In the leading case of United States v. Miller , 317 U.S. 369 , the Court stated that the " just compensation " required by the Fifth Amendment meant " the full and perfect equivalent in money of the property taken . The owner is to be put in as good position pecuniarily as he would have occupied if his property had not been taken . " Id. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fair market value as of the date of the taking , or what a willing buyer would pay in cash to a willing seller . Even this rather broad standard must be qualified to some extent , said the Court , so as to eliminate special factors which might make the property of special value to the condemner . The chief issue in , the Miller case was whether the owner should have the benefit of any increase in value due to prior condemnation of adjacent lands . The Court held that he would be so entitled only where his lands were not probably within the scope of the project from the time the Government was committed to it . The amount of compensation also apparently presented a justiciable constitutional issue in India prior to the amendment in 1955 of Article  | 31 , an amendment discussed hereafter . That was the holding of the Supreme Court of India in West Bengal v. Barter/cc , 17 Sup . Ct . Jour. 95 . A state law had made the maximum compensation payable for the taking of property its market value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Article 31 ( 2 ) of the Constitution provides that no property shall be taken for a public purpose " unless the law provides for compensation for the property taken possession of or acquired and either fixes the amount of the compensation , or specifies the principles on which , and the manner in which , the compensation is to be determined and given . " The Court held that the compensation payable must be " a just equivalent of what the owner has been deprived of " ( Id. , 98 ) and that that requirement was not met in all cases by referring the valuation to December 1 , 1946. " . . . it is common knowledge that since the end of the war , land , particularly around Calcutta , has increased enormously in value and might still further increase very considerably in value when the pace of industrialisation increases . Any principle for determining compensation which denies to the owner this increment in value can not result in the ascertainment of the true equivalent of the land appropriated . " Id. , 99 . Cf. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 592 . Such was the state of Indian constitutional law regulating the taking of property down to April 27 , 1955 . On that date an amendment to Article 31 became effective which substituted for Clause 2 the following clauses : ( 2 ) No property shall be compulsorily acquired or requisitioned save for a public purpose and save by authority of a law which provides for compensation for the property so acquired or requisitioned and either fixes the amount of the compensation or specifies the principles on which , and the manner in which , the compensation is to be determined and given ; and no such law shall be called in question in any court on the ground that the compensation provided by that law is not adequate . ( 2A ) Where a law does not provide for the transfer of the ownership or right to possession of any property to the State or to a corporation owned or controlled by the State , it shall not be deemed to provide for the compulsory acquisition or requisitioning of property , notwithstanding that it deprives any person of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construed . It would seem , however , that the question of a public purpose is still  | a justiciable issue in India . So also is whether property has been taken . The question of the reasonableness of the compensation , however , is no longer a justiciable one , the courts being confined to determining whether the formula for the compensation provided by the legislature has been met . Thus India has broken with one tradition of the law of eminent domain . Some say that she did so only under the compulsion of making practicable the breaking-up of huge estates and the distribution of lands to the villagers . Where , for example , one man owns all or most of a State , it might well be beyond the fiscal ability of the people to pay just compensation in the American sense . Others say the driving force behind the 1955 Amendment was ideological ? an expression of the socialist philosophy . Whatever the cause , the 1955 Amendment casts a shadow over every private factory , plant , or other individual enterprise in India . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? substantial or nominal . There is no review of the reasonableness of the amount of compensation . The result can be just compensation or confiscation ? dependent wholly on the mood of the Parliament . In the United States , neither the Due Process Clause nor the Privileges and Immunities Clause stands today as a major obstacle to social reform . But the former especially serves an important role in our system of checks and balances . The Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments are a source of reserved power for the judiciary , which can be called upon to restrain the legislative and executive branches when they go beyond the limits . The power is a potent one , because it is undefined except by the judiciary itself . The judiciary today , however , is the first to recognize that the Due Process Clauses should not be used to substitute its judgment on policy for that of the other two branches of government . Accordingly , the area of the reserved power contained in the Due Process Clauses is , as a practical matter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free play to the political branches . The courts no longer sit as a super-legislature . Only when the broad limits are transcended by executive or legislative action and the rights of citizens impaired does the judiciary intervene . The right to step in and exercise the reserved power in the Due Process  | Clauses is , however , an important power , central in our scheme of things . The Indian courts have powers narrower than ours in some respects and as broad as ours in others . There is no Due Process Clause in the Indian Constitution . But Article 19 ( 1 ) ( f ) and ( g ) guarantee important rights ? the right to acquire , hold and dispose of property , and the right to practice a profession and carry on an occupation , trade , or business . While these rights may be regulated , the regulations must be " reasonable " ( Article 19 ( 5 ) and ( 6 ) ) ; and it appears that the Supreme Court of India is the ultimate interpreter of what is " reasonable " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws regulating property rights , the judiciary in India speaks with almost the same authority as the judiciary in America . When it came to the taking of property , both performed the same role and spoke with the same authority before India in 1955 amended her Constitution so as to leave to the legislature , rather than to the courts , the question of what constitutes reasonable compensation for the taking . In sum , India , like America , ranked property rights high among the fundamental rights of man . What effect the 1955 Amendment will have remains to be seen . If the Parliament appropriates private property for only nominal compensation , the spectre of confiscation would have entered India , contrary to the teachings of her outstanding jurists. 1 . THAT all men are by nature equally free and independent , and have certain inherent rights , of which , when they enter into a state of society , they can not , by any compact , deprive or divest their posterity ; namely , the enjoyment of life and liberty , with the means of acquiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety . 2 . That all power is vested in , and consequently derived from , the people ; that magistrates are their trustees and servants , and at all times amenable to them . 3 .

That no man , or set of men , are entitled to exclusive or separate emoluments or privileges from the community , but in consideration of publick services ;  | which , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislator , or judge to be hereditary . 5 .

That elections of members to serve as representatives of the people , in assembly , ought to be free ; and that all men , having sufficient evidence of permanent common interest with , and attachment to , the community , have the right of suffrage , and can not be taxed or deprived of their property for publick uses without their own consent , or that of their representatives so elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , in like manner , assented , for the publick good . 7 . That all power of suspending laws , or the execution of laws , by any authority without consent of the representatives of the people , is injurious to their rights , and ought not to be exercised . 8 . That in all capital or criminal prosecutions a man hath a right to demand the cause and nature of his accusation , to be confronted with the accusers and witnesses , to call for evidence in his favour , and to a speedy trial by an impartial jury of his vicinage , without whose unanimous consent he can not be found guilty , nor can he be compelled to give evidence against himself ; that no man be deprived of his liberty except by the law of the land , or the judgment of his peers . 9 . That excessive bail ought not to be required , nor excessive fines imposed , nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted . 10 . That general warrants , whereby any officer or messenger may be commanded to search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seize any person or persons not named , or whose offence is not particularly described and supported by evidence , are grievous and oppressive , and ought not to be granted , . 11 . That in controversies respecting property , and in suits between man and man , the ancient trial by jury is preferable to any other , and ought to be held sacred . 12 . That the freedom of the press is one of the great bulwarks of liberty , and can never be restrained but by despotick governments . 13 . That a well regulated militia , composed of the body of the people , trained to arms , is the proper , natural , and safe defence of a free state ; that standing armies , in time of peace , should be avoided , as dangerous to liberty ; and that , in all cases , the military should be under strict subordination to , and governed by , the civil power . 14 . That the people have a right to uniform government ; and therefore , that no government separate from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to be erected or established within the limits thereof . 15 . That no free government , or the blessing of liberty , can be preserved to any people but by a firm adherence to justice , moderation , temperance , frugality , and virtue , and by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles . 16 . That religion , or the duty which we owe to our CREATOR , and the manner of discharging it , can be directed only by reason and conviction , not by force or violence , and therefore all men are equally entitled to the free exercise of religion , according to the dictates of conscience ; and that it is the mutual duty of all to practise Christian forbearance , love , and charity , towards each other .  | AMENDMENT I : Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion , or prohibiting the free exercise thereof ; or abridging the freedom of speech , or of the press ; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances .
