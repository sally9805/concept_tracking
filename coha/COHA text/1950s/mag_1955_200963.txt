When the world 's statesmen met in San Francisco for the United Nations ' anniversary this week , Dwight Eisenhower was the first to speak . He delivered the welcoming address in the Opera House where the U.N . was born . <P> The President of the U.S. pledged his country 's " unswerving loyalty ' ' to the U.N . and voiced his conviction that there are stirrings and opportunities in the summer of 1955 which might and could lead to a more certain and more prosperous peace . <P> His tribute to the U.N founders was sober and factual : " That there have been failures in attempts to solve international difficulties by the principles of the U.N . charter , none can deny . That there have been victories , only the wilfully blind can fail to see . But clear it is that without the United Nations the failures would still have been written as failures into history . And , certainly , without this organization the victories could not have been achieved ; instead , they might well have been recorded as human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . <P> " Basis for Success . " " The summer of 1955 , like that one of 1945 , is another season of high hope for the world . There again stirs in the hearts of men a renewed devotion to the work for the elimination of war . Each of us here is witness that never in ten years has the will of many nations seemed so resolved to wage an honest and sustained campaign for a just and lasting peace . . . The heartfelt longings of countless millions for abundance and justice and peace seem to be commanding , everywhere , a response from their governments . These longings have strengthened the weak , encouraged the doubtful , heartened the tired , confirmed the believing . Almost it seems that men , with souls restored , are , with faith and courage , resuming the march toward the greatest human goal . <P> " Within a month there will be a four power conference of heads of Government . Whether or not we shall then reach the initial decisions that will start dismantling the terrible apparatus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of World War II , I do not know . <P> " The basis for success is simply put : it is that every individual at that meeting be loyal to the spirit of the United Nations and dedicated to the principles of its charter . I can solemnly pledge to you here-and to all the men and women of the world who may hear or read my words-that those who represent the United States will strive to be thus loyal , thus dedicated . . . <P> " Munitions of Peace . " " We shall work with all others-especially through this great organization , the United Nations - so that peaceful and reasonable negotiations may replace the clash of the battlefield . In this way we can in time make unnecessary the vast armaments that-even when maintained only for security-terrify the world with their devastating potentiality and tax unbearably the creative energies of men . <P> " We and a majority of all nations , I believe , are united in another hope : that every government will abstain from itself attempting , or aiding others to attempt , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to gain political or material advantage or because of differences in philosophies , religions or ideologies.
