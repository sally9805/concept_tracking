The Roman Catholic Church teaches that any mechanical interference with the consequences of sexual intercourse is a mortal sin . But The Netherlands ' Catholic Institute for Social-Ecclesiastical Research ( moving next month to Geneva ) has launched a $5,000 prize contest to find new ways of controlling population . <P> The institute fears that the population increase in the " underdeveloped areas " will be so rapid that " religious and moral disintegration " may result . To prevent this , argues the institute , " social , economic and cultural means " should be looked for , but may not be enough . Asks the institute : " How could the population growth itself be influenced " to bring about a " social structure satisfying the-requirements of complete human well-being ?

L. Zeegers in The Hague last week . " In the rest of the world Catholics are contributing to the problem by the doctrine they advocate . We as Catholics have duty to find a solution to the problem . My aim is to compel the church to see its responsibility . " <P> The church traditionally sees its reponsibility as first to increase the number of souls who may worship God . Limitation of births , however , is not considered necessarily sinful when brought about through abstinence or the avoidance of intercourse during fertile periods ( assuming that they can be determined ) .

If you want to find the secret of escaping loneliness , the church can show you the most satisfying way never to be lonely again . " <P> Thus began an advertising campaign for Cincinnati 's Episcopal Christ Church designed to meet the crisis of the city church . For active church life has followed the shift to suburbia , leaving the smoke-blackened downtown edifices behind to minister to dwindling congregations . Last year Christ Church decided to buck the trend , put up a new $1,500,000 church on East Fourth Street in the same downtown parish that it had served for 120 years .

Sive took over . Sive , an advertising man , had long been wondering what could be done with consumer appeal in church advertising instead of the customary institutional copy . In collaboration with Rector Morris Arnold he worked out a series of two-column , 12-in. display ads for Cincinnati newspapers .
