In the high , bleak Karakoram , mightiest of the Himalayan ranges , China , Russia , India . Tibet . Afghanistan and Pakistan merge in a tumult of mountains . Dominating the peaks , in the northernmost corner of Pakistan-held Kashmir , is the world 's second highest mountain : 28,250-ft . Mt . Godwin Austen , known to mountaineers as K-2. * For years , K-2 has been regarded as unclimbable . Last week the news came through that the unclimbable had been climbed by an Italian expedition led by Ardito Desio , 57 , a geology professor at the University of Milan . <P> Stubborn as Sin . Desio 's was the sixth attempt to conquer the " killer mountain , " as K-2 is often called . The Duke of the Abruzzi tried and failed in 1909 ; so did the Duke of Spoleto in 1929 . Always before , men were driven back by cold as severe as Everest 's , gales that can stop a man 's breathing , rock falls that roar like siege guns , flinging boulders the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italian mountain , " as Everest was the British , Nanga Parbat the German , Annapurna the French . ( In the ' 305 , Americans joined in on K2 . reached 26,000 feet in 1938 , 27,000 in 1939 , 25,800 in 1953 . ) Professor Ardito Desio had climbed with the Duke of Spoleto . The professor is a mild-mannered little man with a Punch-andJudy nose and a mountaineer 's reputation of being " stubborn as sin . " Last spring Desio organized another Italian expedition , with eleven mountaineers , five scientists and a Pakistani army colonel . <P> <P> Up the Gorges . From Skardu ( pop . 2,000 ) , ancient capital of Baltistan. they moved north to a valley where the slow ascent began . Week after week , they toiled upwards in a climate where a bareheaded man with his feet in the shade can get sunstroke and frostbite simultaneously . They bounced across torrents on inflated goatskin rafts , threaded their way through gorges whose walls rose sheer to pinnacles two miles above them . In May they left behind the last green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where no birds sing . In their faces was a biting wind , boring relentlessly down from Baltoro glacier . <P> Climbing the glacier was agony . At such altitudes , sweat and tears can turn to frost . One day Desio radioed ( by portable transmitter ) that his Hunza porters had deserted , fearful of the gaping crevasses. the toppling pillars of ice . For the next 23 days , nothing more was heard from him . <P> Death on the Ridge . Professor Desio and his men laid Camp 1 at the foot of the Abruzzi Ridge , a gaunt rib which lances upwards towards the summit of K2 . On the fearful Abruzzi , perhaps the longest continuously steep climbing ridge in the world , a man is like a fly on a wall . He must edge himself up a vertical " chimney , " 100 feet high ; if he grabs too hard at the rock , it crumbles in his hand . <P> One of the most powerful of the climbers was Mario Puchoz , 36 , whose friends called him " the Mule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian front-but K-2 proved harsher still . On June 21 the Mule died of pneumonia , at 19,000 feet . He was buried near the grave of U.S. Geologist Arthur Gilkey. who was swept away by an avalanche during the 1953 U.S. assault on K2 .
