OFF the beaten track 60 miles northwest of Rome stands one of the strangest witnesses on earth to man 's love of the curious and bizarre . Near the Villa Orsini at Bomarzo is a whole sculpture garden of beasts and ogres carved from volcanic rock ( see color pages ) on the site . Rarely has sentiment taken a more bizarre turn . Created in the 1560s by Duke Pierfrancesco ( " Vicino " ) Orsini , the sculpture garden was meant not only to astonish and delight , but to serve as a memorial to Orsini 's deceased wife . <P> The garden was " rediscovered " when Salvador Dali journeyed there from Rome to pose in an ogre 's mouth ( opposite ) while conversing with a white cat . Research by Italian and English scholars indicates that , far from being a surrealist chamber of horrors , the garden was originally a rather solemn effort to combine the wonders of the ancient world with figures from a pagan sacred grove . With sphinxes on either side of the entrance to give fair warning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some otherworldly spirit had brought the strange stone figures into existence , left no record of who the actual sculptors or stonecutters were . <P> Some of the sources of Orsini 's inspiration can be guessed at . The ogre seems borrowed from the Mouth of Hell leading to Pluto 's cave , as illustrated in medieval manuscripts on Ovid . The curious words ringing the ogre 's mouth-Lasciate Ogni Pensiero Voi Que Entrate ( Abandon all thought , ye who enter ) - refer to the cup of forgetfulness ancient Greeks thought was drunk before crossing the river Lethe . The dragon-fighting lions ( probably an oblique reference to political feuds ) derived from a sketch by Leonardo da Vinci . The elephant with castle was a symbol used to depict Eleazar 's slaying of the beast of King Antiochus ( / Maccabees 6:17-46 ) , a feat of self-sacrifice interpreted as prefiguring Christ 's martyrdom . But many of Vicino Orsini 's fantasies remain obscure . He set out to create a garden unlike any ever seen-and he succeeded .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
