txt " We 're not overexpanded . " Such a statement could be debated if it came from many companies in the auto industry , but for Motor Wheel Corp . it 's based on a simple fact : The company has not expanded plants since 1946 . H. F. Cotes. 53-year old president of this 23-year old company , thinks this policy will have important meaning in the business period ahead . " I think we 're in an excellent position on plants and facilities in case of any downward adjustment that may occur in business , " said Mr. Cotes Motor Wheel had large sales in the first half of this year but has doubts about the second half . Hence management is pleased that it has only three plants , all in Lansing . It acquired its last unit in 1946 from the War Assets Administration .

Stock dividends have been paid twice : 25% in 1928 plus cash dividends of $2.25 ; and 20% in 1929 plus $2.75 in money . Motor Wheel also shows its conservative side in management , which has an average age in the 50 's . There have been only three presidents in its history and no stockholder fights . H. F. Harper , who founded the company , was president until he resigned on December 31 , 1946. due to ill health . J. E. Garlent succeeded him to serve until his retirement last year .
