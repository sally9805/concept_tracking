Omnibus : Prettied up for the color cameras and invited by NBC to take George Gobel 's place on Tuesday night , this good grey lady did not quite know what to do with herself . Touted as a " hilarious report on the suburbs , " Suburban Revue got about as far out of Manhattan as Central Park . Host Alistair Cooke showed up in skimmer , foulard scarf and blazer , to talk about the wonders of aluminum ( spelled A-1-u-m-i-n-i-u-m , Ltd . ) . Bert Lahr , a mighty available Jones around all channels these days , blinked and " poo-poo-pa-dooed " through some excruciating jokes ( " Are you Ivy ? " " It 's crawlin ' all over me " ) and brayed his inimitable full-octave singing quaver . Digging into Broadway 's attic of old goodies , Omnibus borrowed Lend an Ear 's funny , picture-hatted Gladiola ( " Skiddy , give me some hooch " ) Girl and a rollicking Prohibition Era chorus line to vamp the Long Island playboys . <P> The best Revue had to offer was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Elaine May , 25 , whose satiric thrusts at the telephone company 's " Organization Woman " were fresh , inspired stuff . Nichols and May also did a racy , offbeat skit called " The Dawn of Love or The Moon Also Rises in an Automobile ! " Scratching her ear and nervously shoving her sleeve up and down her forearm , Elaine admired the " suicidally beautiful " lake while Mike talked of other things . " Every human being has got certain natural urges , and I 've got some , " he began . <P> Elaine : I do n't know what George has told you about me in the locker room . I mean , this is our first date . <P> Mike : I know what you 're going to say . I know you 're going to say I wo n't respect you . Right ? Listen , honey , I want to tell you right here and now I would respect you like cur-razee . <P> Elaine : Are you sure you would n't just be grateful ? <P> Conquest : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyepiece of the telescope that towered through the observatory roof and spied on the moon . His voice echoed in the empty chamber . " Now , I note about twelve impact craters , and the largest of these I shall mark on the map with an A. " said Dutch-born Dr. Gerard Kuiper head of the University of Chicago 's Yerkes Observatory . By such sharply focused glimpses of scientists at work , Conquest ( CBS ) started to live up to its promise as a $1,000,000 series of ten science programs that will stretch into next season . After a talky start , the hour-long program settled down with Dr. Kuiper and Dr. H. Julian ( " Harvey " ) Allen , a rumpled giant who devised the blunt-nose cone that can safely return a missile warhead through the atmosphere without burning up with friction . One startling sequence : a blunt-nose staying intact during lab tests while a white-hot , pointed-nose disintegrated . Conquest 's point : science and scientists can make fascinating fare without the support of capering cartoons or high-powered hokum .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
