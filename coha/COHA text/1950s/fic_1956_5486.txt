Twenty-eight-year-old William Nolan , another newcomer to the field , introduces us to the capricious Time Door of Professor C. Cydwick Ohms , guaranteed to solve the accumulated problems of the world of the year 2057. of time and texas by ... William F. Nolan Open the C. Cydwick Ohms Time Door , take but a single step , and --  " In one fell swoop , " declared Professor C. Cydwick Ohms , releasing a thin blue ribbon of pipe-smoke and rocking back on his heels , "  - -  I intend to solve the greatest problem facing mankind today . Colonizing the Polar Wastes was a messy and fruitless business . And the Enforced Birth Control Program could n't be enforced . Overpopulation still remains the thorn in our side . Gentlemen --  " He paused to look each of the assembled reporters in the eye . "  - -  there is but one answer . " " Mass annihilation ? " quavered a cub reporter . " Posh , boy ! Certainly not ! " The professor bristled . " The answer is -- TIME ! " " Time ? " " Exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept aside a red velvet drape -- to reveal a tall structure of gleaming metal . " As witness ! " " Golly , what 's that thing ? " queried the cub . " This thing , " replied the professor acidly , "  - -  is the C. Cydwick Ohms Time Door . " " Whillikers , a Time Machine ! " " Not so , not so . Please , boy ! A Time Machine , in the popular sense , is impossible . Wild fancy ! However --  " The professor tapped the dottle from his pipe . "  - -  by a mathematically precise series of infinite calculations , I have developed the remarkable C. Cydwick Ohms Time Door . Open it , take but a single step -- and , presto ! The Past ! " " But , where in the past , Prof. ? " Ohms smiled easily down at the tense ring of faces . " Gentlemen , beyond this door lies the sprawling giant of the Southwest -- enough land to absorb Earth 's overflow like that ! " He snapped his fingers . " I speak , gentlemen , of Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " They have no choice . The Time Door is strictly a one-way passage . I saw to that . It will be utterly impossible for anyone in 1957 to re-enter our world of 2057 . And now -- the Past awaits ! " He tossed aside his professorial robes . Under them Cydwick Ohms wore an ancient and bizarre costume : black riding boots , highly polished and trimmed in silver ; wool chaps ; a wide , jewel-studded belt with an immense buckle ; a brightly checked shirt topped by a blazing red bandana . Briskly , he snapped a tall ten-gallon hat on his head , and stepped to the Time Door . Gripping an ebony handle , he tugged upward . The huge metal door oiled slowly back . " Time , " said Cydwick Ohms simply , gesturing toward the gray nothingness beyond the door . The reporters and photographers surged forward , notebooks and cameras at the ready . " What if the door swings shut after you 're gone ? " one of them asked . " A groundless fear , boy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Time Door can never be closed . And now -- good-bye , gentlemen . Or , to use the proper colloquialism -- so long , hombres ! " Ohms bowed from the waist , gave his ten-gallon hat a final tug , and took a single step forward . And did not disappear . He stood , blinking . Then he swore , beat upon the unyielding wall of grayness with clenched fists , and fell back , panting , to his desk . " I 've failed ! " he moaned in a lost voice . " The C. Cydwick Ohms Time Door is a botch ! " He buried his head in trembling hands . The reporters and photographers began to file out . Suddenly the professor raised his head . " Listen ! " he warned . A slow rumbling , muted with distance , emanated from the dense grayness of the Time Door . Faint yips and whoopings were distinct above the rumble . The sounds grew steadily -- to a thousand beating drums -- to a rolling sea of thunder ! Shrieking , the reporters and photographers scattered for the stairs . Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cydwick Ohms , swinging , with some difficulty , onto one of three thousand Texas steers stampeding into the laboratory .
