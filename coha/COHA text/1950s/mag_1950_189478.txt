In the book-lined study of a Georgetown home , two men who frankly dislike each other sat down for a frank conversation . The host was Secretary of State Dean Acheson . His guest was tart-tongued Styles Bridges of New Hampshire , the Senior Republican Senator after the ailing Arthur Vandenberg , and the man who had vowed to " get Acheson . " <P> Dean Acheson 's invitation to Bridges was more than a gesture toward restoring bipartisanship in the nation 's foreign policy . Country by country , Acheson ticked off to Bridges some of the danger spots in the cold war-Korea , Berlin , Burma . The most dangerous of all , said Dean Acheson , was Berlin . <P> There were firm indications that some time in May the Communists would try to march half a million youth-organization members into Berlin to force the Western powers out of the German capital ( TIME , April 17 ) . There might be serious violence , perhaps out &; out fighting between East and West . In defense , the U.S. was prepared to use police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , machine guns . The Western powers would have to stand up against the assault , the State Department believed , for to lose Berlin would be to lose all of Europe . <P> These harsh facts impressed Styles Bridges . The U.S. should take the strongest action necessary to stay in Berlin , he agreed , and he would use all his influence in the U.S. Senate to back that stand . <P> Four days later , Styles Bridges was invited to the White House . Again it was a meeting of political enemies . Only three weeks earlier , President Truman had denounced Bridges as a " saboteur " of U.S. foreign policy . Again both sides got along with wary amicability . They had " a very satisfactory talk , " said the President afterwards . The meeting was a " very eminent gesture , " said Bridges , though he reserved the right to " speak my views when I deem it desirable . " Out of the meeting came an agreement to keep Republican Leaders Taft and Wherry posted on all future sessions , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> By announcing so early and so explicitly its intention to remain firm , the U.S. was making it plain to Moscow that any bloodshed in Berlin would be on Russia 's hands .
