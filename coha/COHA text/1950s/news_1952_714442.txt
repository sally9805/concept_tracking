txt Shotgun blasts and pistol shots early today shattered windows and ripped walls in the home of Julius Gunderson , 65 , a tilesetter , and his wife , Agnes , 63 , at 233 N. Orchard st. , Bensenville , Du Page county . The shots were fired shortly after the Gundersons went to bed . They were not injured . Gunderson told Bensenville police he believed the attack was the result of quarrels with officers of local 67 of the Tilesetters ' union , AFL , over its refusal to reinstate him to mem  --  ership . The street in front of the Gunderson home was littered with empty shells and cartridges . Gunderson said he had recently complained to a federal anti-trust investigator that he had difficulty in purchasing tile , presumably because of pressure put on dealers by union officials who sought to stop sales to nonunion tilesetters . Gunderson said : " I do n't care if they kill me , but I 've got to work to eat and they 're not going to stop me. "
