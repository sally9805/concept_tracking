The Law and the Lady ( MGM ) is the third movie version of The Last of Mrs. Cheyney , Frederick Lonsdale 's 1925 stage comedy of larceny in the drawing room . Inspired by the time-tested Hollywood axiom , " if at first you succeed , try , try again , " the latest cinemadaptation comes off well enough to suggest that even now movie-goers may not be seeing the last of Mrs. Cheyney . <P> Though the producers have changed the locale , period and much of the plot , it is still the amusing story of a pair of elegant swindlers preying on a group of social snobs who turn out to be just as fraudulent , in their own way , as the crooks . The culprits team up in Victorian London , where one is the perfect lady 's maid ( Greer Garson ) , the other a scampish , penniless aristocrat ( Michael Wilding ) .

First came 1947 's Dear Ruth , a comedy hit ; then came the sequel , 1949 's Dear Wife , a turkey . The third of the series can be described as a turkey croquette . Like its predecessor , Dear Brat celebrates the adolescent excesses of Mona Freeman , playing a feminine Henry Aldrich . This time she cues Edward Arnold 's slow burns and Billy De Wolfe 's prissy swivets by trying to rehabilitate a hardened criminal ( Lyle Bettger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The result is the kind of movie that helps sell television sets .
