For all the general cheering that greeted its announcement , the U.S. visit of Nikita Khrushchev is packed with political dynamite . Republican Presidential Hopeful Richard Nixon , for example , is certain to be blamed if the Khrushchev trip turns diplomatically sour-even though it was arranged by President Eisenhower with little or no real reference to Nixon 's presence in Russia . No one recognizes Nixon 's problem more than New York 's Governor Nelson Rockefeller , who has himself said noncommittally : " We want to contribute to an easing of tensions , but we want it known we are not letting our guard down . " On that platform , Rocky is in a position to jump either way , depending on how the Khrushchev visit turns out . <P> Many another U.S. politician has followed Rocky 's example , either remaining quiet or simply making meaningless noises . But last week Connecticut 's able Freshman Democratic Senator Thomas Dodd delivered the most forceful expression so far of the opposition to a Khrushchev visit . Dodd 's speech was made to a near-empty Senate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does turn out badly , then Dodd 's words could become the battle cry in one of the decade 's hottest political controversies . <P> " What , " asked Connecticut 's Dodd , " would the Senate and the country have thought if in 1939 President Roosevelt had invited Adolf Hitler to a barnstorming tour of the U.S. , fresh from conquest of Czechoslovakia , Austria and Poland and in the midst of his extermination of millions of Jews ? " Extending the comparison , Dodd said : " Khrushchev rose to Communist prominence as the hangman of the Ukraine . He has maintained himself in power as the butcher of Budapest . " <P> Hope of Liberty . Dodd 's strongest point was that the very fact of the visit would enhance Khrushchev 's prestige and position at home and in the Soviet satellites-even while weakening the Western alliance . Said Dodd : " We can be certain that the satellite peoples , who still cling to the hope of liberty , will be flooded with photographs of Khrushchev being wined and dined , flattered and applauded by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be interpreted as a reflection of American acceptance of permanent Soviet domination of their lands . " <P> In the free world , said Dodd , the U.S. 's decision to opt for Big Two talks might seem like " appeasement , " might have a " divisive effect " upon U.S. allies fearful of secret deals . U.S. allies " under the guns of Communism " in West Berlin , Formosa , South Korea would interpret Khrushchev in the U.S. as " a softening of our determination to resist . " Said Dodd : " Those who have been soft on Communism will grow softer . Those who are unconcerned about the Communist menace will become more indifferent . Those who have been sounding the alarms will find their difficulties multiplied . "
