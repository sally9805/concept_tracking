In the Grand Ballroom of Manhattan 's Waldorf-Astoria Hotel . Vice President Richard Nixon rose one night last week to deliver a major U.S. foreign policy statement . Before him sat 1,500 members of the Automobile Manufacturers Association in town for the National Automobile Show ( see BUSINESS ) . The Vice President had a twofold mission : 1 ) to answer the weeks of criticism of U.S. policy in the Middle East , and 2 ) to lay new groundwork for the strengthening of the Atlantic alliance and the whole free world . <P> With a text that had been discussed with Secretary of State John Foster Dulles , Nixon began by reviewing the 40-day world crisis . There had been " some observers of world affairs . . . the critics of despair and the prophets of doom , " who had proclaimed a massive Soviet victory in the Middle East . These critics , Nixon believed , were taking " a shortsighted and , if I might respectfully say so , immature view of the issues . " When Israel , Britain and France attacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its principles , or because its friends were involved , would " conveniently look the other way . " If the U.S. had supported the British-French-Israeli position in Egypt , they " might have won a military victory in that area . But they and we would have lost the moral support of the whole world . . . Because we took the position we did , the peoples of Africa and Asia now know that the U.S. has no illusions about ' the white man 's burden ' and ' white supremacy . ' The military victory our friends might have won in the Near East would not have solved . . . the problem . Lasting solutions are rarely forged in the ruins of war . " <P> " Eternal Credit . " Linking the U.S. position on the two menacing arms of world crisis , the Vice President said that the U.S. stand on the Middle East made the U.S. fit and qualified to condemn Soviet barbarity in Hungary . Such condemnation was the U.S. 's sole weapon , " since the alternative was action on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Freedom Fighters of Budapest , said Nixon , won a great victory in the battle for men 's minds . " The lesson is etched in the mind and seared in the souls of all mankind . Can it be seriously suggested that any nation in the world today would trust the butchers of Budapest ? " <P> Then the Vice President moved on to the next logical phase of U.S. foreign policy . From the first day of Suez , President Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles had insisted that the U.S. difference with its allies over Suez should not obscure the long-term values and meanings of the Atlantic alliance. * Nixon urged his listeners to give the British and French " eternal credit " for eventu ally accepting the U.N . resolutions on the cease-fire and withdrawal of troops . He urged less attention to fault-finding and more to seeking a long-range settlement in the Middle East . <P> Nixon then ventured into a politically delicate area by speaking of " the financial plight " of Britain in a way that seemed to suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I believe it is in our interest as well as theirs to assist them in this hour of difficulty . "
