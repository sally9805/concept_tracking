Mrs. Hiram Cole Houghton of Red Oak , Iowa , president of the General Federation of Women 's Clubs , stepped up last week to say something about the girls . She told a meeting in Philadelphia : " We bear a greater responsibility than ever before for the preservation of our American way of life , because , first , there are so many of us ; second , we live longer than men ; third , we have 92 labor-saving devices to give us more leisure time to think about the affairs , events and problems of our times . We spend about 85 out of every dollar going for consumer goods ( and we suggest what men should do with the remaining 15 ) . We own most of the factories , stores , utilities and ' natural resources ' ... As voters , women now have a clear national majority of the franchise . . . Women are . . . principally responsible for the education of the young of both sexes . . . Women inspire men to do those things which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men do not build houses or castles or beautiful churches or diesel trains , or even make soap , for themselves . They do it for , or because of , women . " As a result of all this , said Mrs. Houghton , " women were never so important as in the year 1951. "
