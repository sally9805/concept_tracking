Beneath the bright white lights of Bournemouth 's Pavilion-more commonly switched on for comedians and jugglers entertaining the seaside resort trade-Britain 's trade-union movement showed its age last week . World War II and service in Britain 's postwar Labor government have given the brash , rash revolutionaries of yesteryear a more mature sense of responsibility , a new aura of middle-class respectability . Less anxious to " nationalize everything , " more alert to the Communist menace in their ranks , the leaders of the Trades Union Congress ( 8,377,325 members in 185 affiliated unions ) have moved steadily to the right in recent years . But despite this right turn , some pockets of militant Communism still remain in the movement . <P> Biggest pocket is the Electrical Trades Union , whose 239,334 members are controlled by Communist President Frank Foulkes and Communist General Secretary Frank Haxell . And the opening session of the goth annual meeting of the T.U.C. last week found the Red electricians in a peculiarly vulnerable position : although 38-year-old E.T.U. Member Leslie Cannon had been elected a delegate to the congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Squeaky " Haxell had refused to accredit him because he had quit the Communist Party in disgust over Russian repression of the Hungarian revolution . But when fiercely anti-Communist Labor M.P . Walter Padley jumped to the rostrum to demand a debate on this piece of party-lining highhandedness , the congress exploded into an angry uproar . With Cannon looking on from the visitors ' gallery , Communist Foulkes defiantly proclaimed that it was nobody else 's business whom the E.T.U. accredited . " I do n't like Walter Padley , " shouted Foulkes , " but I do n't try to stop his union sending him here . " <P> Ringing his bell for order , T.U.C. President Tom Yates tacitly endorsed Foulkes 's position , quickly passed on to less controversial issues . But the incident left a bad taste in many a British mouth . Suggesting that the T.U.C. pass a rule banning Reds from office in its affiliated unions , the liberal Manchester Guardian asked : " Why should democratic trade unionists be expected to put up with Communists as a matter of political course ?
