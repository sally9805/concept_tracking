The last remnants of William the Conqueror 's Dukedom of Normandy still held by the British Crown are the Channel Islands of Jersey , Guernsey , Alderney and Sark . There , in sentimental moments , Norman islanders still sometimes toast William 's distinguished successor George VI as duke rather than king . There , in hard-pressed moments , islanders still look for aid to William 's great ancestor Rollo , first Duke of Normandy . Rollo , it is said , was so just and severe a prince that during his early loth Century reign a farmer could leave a plow in an open field with no fear of theft . <P> In later days , when Rollo was gone , Normans resorted to the cry of " Haro " ( possibly a contraction of " Ha , Rollo " ) to call the old duke 's attention to the new wickedness that stalked the land . In time the Clameur de Haro became the Norman equivalent for a court injunction , a legal demand to stop wrongdoing . The Code Napoleon put Haro out of business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clameur de Haro still had the force of law and " Haro being called , the enterprise must cease . " <P> The Hilltop House . Three months ago on the island of Guernsey , fellow bank clerks began to notice that gaunt , hound-eared Tom Hugo was becoming more &; more abstracted about the water pipe supplying his house on a hilltop in St. Peter Port . The water pipe , which Tom considered his own , was already feeding two houses , and Tom had learned that soon the waterworks were planning to add another two houses on the line . If that were done , thought Tom , there would be scarcely a trickle left for himself and his family of eight . He plunged deep into Guernsey law , studying what he might do . <P> Last week when the waterworks men came to start their digging , Tom was ready for them . As the first shovel bit the dirt , Tom Hugo strode from his house , fell on his knees and cried : " Haro ! Haro ! Haro ! l'aide , mon Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my prince , I am being wronged ) . Then he recited the Lord 's Prayer in French . Without a word , the workmen picked up their tools . <P> " When he went on his knees , " observed a carpenter standing by , " I knew straight off what he was up to . When he said the prayer in French , I knew he had them stopped proper . " <P> The Lowest Dungeon . When the prayer was done , Tom gathered two witnesses , took them over to notify the bailiff , then bicycled along to file due notice of clameur with the greffe ( clerk of court ) and affix two five-shilling stamps . " Nothing more will be done , " he told his family confidently that night at dinner , " until the case is decided in court . " <P> In old days , when crying Haro was more frequent ( Tom 's is only the eighth clameur to be raised since 1900 ) , the penalty for losing a case was severe : 24 hours ' confinement in the lowest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is only a small fine . Twenty years ago , Alfred Machon was fined one shilling for a false clameur ( TIME , March 3,1930 ) . As Tom 's case rested last week , however , the gloomier greybeards of Guernsey noted with interest that workmen were busy restoring the old castle 's long-neglected dungeon .
