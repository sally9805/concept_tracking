Tipped off that a mysterious gang of undergraduates was trying to peddle advance copies of his final examination for $30 apiece , Instructor Gilbert Geis of the University of Oklahoma decided that it would be only proper for him to crack the case himself . Last week he got one of his students to cooperate , told him to let it be known that he needed an advance copy of the exam and to get one of the culprits to deliver it himself . The trap worked : when the culprit arrived , both Instructor Geis and the campus chief of police were on hand to greet him . The culprit and his three cohorts quickly confessed . They had gotten the examination questions from a used Mimeograph stencil that had been tossed into a campus trash can . " But some day , " remarked one of them as he was led away , " I 'm going to have to take the course . " Instructor Geis 's course : elementary criminology.               @ @ @ @ @ @
