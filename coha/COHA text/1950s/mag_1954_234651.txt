As the primary race for the governorship officially got under way last week , Georgia found that its eight male Democratic candidates were at least agreed on one thing : not one had any intention of doing away with segregation in the public schools . Lest there be any doubt , seven of the would-be governors had gone on record before the 21-man , all-white Georgia education commission , especially set up to explore ways and means of circumventing the U.S. Supreme Court 's historic anti-segregation decision . Unlike the only woman in the race-Lawyer Grace Wilkey Thomas , past president of the Women 's Bar Association of Georgia ( " There does not seem to me to be anything to do but obey the law " ) - the seven all had various strategies : <P> Lawyer Ben Garland of Jackson : empower local school boards to segregate the schools on the basis of sex , color , or whatever other qualifications they wish . <P> Charles Gowen of Brunswick : empower county superintendents to designate the school and class each student should attend , and if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools . " <P> Lieut . Governor S. Marvin Griffin of Atlanta : let city and county school boards assign each student to a school . Griffin also suggested a residency requirement to keep " foreign agitators " out of the state . " Social equality , " said he , " is impossible . The schools are not going to be mixed come hell or high water . " <P> Fred Hand of Pelham , speaker of the house : adopt not one plan but many , and keep all these a secret in order to thwart the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People . " If we run out of plans , I 'd be in favor of the private-school plan ... I believe in segregation so strongly . . . that I 'd gladly go to jail . " <P> Former Acting Governor Melvin E. Thompson of Valdosta : amend the U.S. Constitution to give the states exclusive rights over the schools . <P> Tom Linder of Hazlehurst , commissioner of agriculture : let the state support segregated schools and perhaps give educational grants to persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons ( " a mere lunatic fringe , " according to Linder ) might well be required to take a psychiatric test first . <P> Edmond Barfield of Atlanta , president of the National Association of Handicaps : abolish the Supreme Court .
