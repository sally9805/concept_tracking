Jersey Joe Walcott 's age is variously estimated at 39 ( by Jersey Joe ) to 46 ( by boyhood acquaintances ) . By either estimate , he is too old a party to be fighting for the heavyweight championship of the world . Last week , nonetheless-largely because TV audiences will stand for anything billed as a prize fight-the sturdy old Negro was put into the ring with Heavyweight Champion Rocky Marciano , 28 . It was a triumph neither for the sponsor ( Gillette Safety Razor Co. ) , for the autocratic matchmakers ( International Boxing Club ) , nor for the heavy-footed contestants . <P> Poor old Jersey Joe ducked , clinched and backpedaled with all the grace he could muster , but it was n't enough . With less than two and a half minutes gone in the first round , Marciano landed with a left and right to the jaw , and Jersey Joe bowled to the canvas . He sat there , a glazed look in his eyes , while the referee counted ten . Then he popped to his feet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight-as it was billed-was all over . Jersey Joe 's share of the receipts was a quarter of a million dollars , or what amounted to the excellent pay of $1,724 a second . Rocky , the winner , collected only $166,038 . <P> In a record of another sort , the TV sponsors , Gillette Safety Razor Co. , paid over $300,000 ( to promoters and the network ) , for what turned out to be just a couple of quick commercials .
