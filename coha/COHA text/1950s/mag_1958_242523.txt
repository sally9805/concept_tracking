When a mysterious couple rented huge Stella Maris estate in Buenos Aires ' residential town of General Pacheco , the villagers were naturally curious , buzzed about who the strangers were , where they came from , what they were doing . No one could find out . Not even delivery boys got past the front gate . What went on inside the two houses , the annex , in the fine garden , the orchard , swimming pool and volleyball field ? The windows were curtained ; a seemingly endless stream of strangers went to and fro ; and they ate enough food for a platoon . Townfolk talked about smugglers , maybe even revolutionaries . <P> Good Morning , Professor . Provincial Criminal Investigation Director Benito Ibanez listened to the gossip and sent a few men around for a routine snoop . When they got nowhere Ibaez sallied forth with 70 armed cops and barged into the larger of the two houses gun in hand , ready for anything . Not even Ibanez was prepared for what he saw . Flanked by a Red star bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was holding class for some two dozen adult students . Ibanez had stumbled onto the " Aurora " college-an international center for training Communist propagandists . <P> Amid a torrent of abuse , the police whisked the head man , one " Professor " Arturo Rogelio Ferrari , and his students off to the station . It was quite a haul : two lawyers from Bolivia , a literature professor from Ecuador , a schoolteacher from Caracas , another from Panama , a tailor from Colombia , a seamstress from Peru , a mason frorrwltaly . All were following a six-month course that had started four months before . All lived in strict discipline . Reveille was at 6 a.m. to the strains of the Soviet Air Force march . The " students " studied Latin American politics and economics , the place of women in Communism , Russian history , ideology , public speaking , propaganda , etc . The most convincing debaters and public speakers got special diplomas . Money to finance the school came from the Argentine Communist Party , but the parties in each student 's country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Can Be a Lawyer Too . " By the time Crime Chief Ibaez returned to headquarters with his prisoners , two of Argentina 's top Commie lawyers , Julio Viaggio and Rodolfo Alfaro , were waiting with writs of habeas corpus . " Aha , I can be a lawyer too , " snapped the chief . Where was Professor Ferrari 's boardinghouse permit ? " This is against municipal law . " With that , Ibaez closed Stella Maris , charged its tenants with illicit operations . <P> Last week the mysterious Aurora was fading , but few people doubted that a new one would open somewhere else . The federal police estimated that within the last year alone Argentine Reds have received some $30 million from abroad .
