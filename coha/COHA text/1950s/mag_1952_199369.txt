Even such old friends of the Chinese Nationalists as Congressman Walter Judd and Senator William Knowland were shaken last August by a new outcry of corruption against the Chiang Kai-shek government . The attack came from two officers serving with the Chinese Air Force Mission in Washington-Lieut . General P. T. Mow and his chief aide , Colonel V. S. Hsiang . Their superiors in Formosa had asked them to account for $19 million entrusted to them for military procurement . Publicly refusing to do so , they declared that they were being persecuted by Nationalist thugs and thieves . Somehow , their version of the dispute , vague but voluble , made frontpage news . <P> The Formosa government brought civil suit in the federal district court in Washington to compel Mow to account for the millions put into his hands , and to return any money still left ( the Nationalists thought there ought to be $7,000,000 ) . Mow retained as his attorney Colonel William A. Roberts , a Washington lawyer who fed a steady stream of " news " to reporters ; the newsmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really the victims and opponents of corruption they claimed to be . Over Roberts ' objections the district court insisted that it had jurisdiction , ordered plaintiff and defendant to appear to tell what he knew about the money . <P> About the Money . At that point ( beginning in January ) Mow and Hsiang began to act like men afraid to test their case before a judge . The court managed to get its hands on only $614,000 of the $7,000,000 or so which Mow presumably still controls . Mow quietly took a powder : on Jan. 23 , then on Feb. 8 , he failed to appear for deposition . He went to Mexico City instead . Hsiang also absented himself from Washington . Last week , to Attorney Roberts ' embarrassment , came news from Hong Kong : Hsiang 's family had gone from San Francisco to Shanghai on the Communist mainland . <P> This week , with the two officers still absent , the district court handed down a judgment by default against Mow .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
