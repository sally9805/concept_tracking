The familiar strains of Auld Lang Syne swelled up from a sprawling cluster of tiny coral islands in the Indian Ocean last week , but the singers were not celebrating the New Year ; they were merely singing their own national anthem . After years of autocratic rule under Sultans known as the Golden Feet , * the Maldive ( rhymes with small hive ) Islands had just become the world 's newest republic . Queen Elizabeth herself sent the Moslem islanders a message from another island , wishing them " good luck , fair winds and calm waters . " A British cruiser stood by to fire a salute , and thousands of soft-eyed , coffee-colored Maldivians-the men in sarongs , the women in Mother Hubbards-crowded on to the main island of Male to join the festivities . <P> The Maldives ( pop . 90,000 ) had waited some 800 years for their republic , but the struggle for self-government had been as placid and uneventful as most of life on the islands . It came about largely because the islands ' Sultans themselves got tired of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some 400 miles southwest of Ceylon , protected first by the Portuguese , then the Dutch and finally the British , the little Maldives long knew few of the blessings and none of the curses of civilization . <P> Murder is still all but unknown ; infrequent crimes like pilfering are punished by public whipping . The gentle Maldivians are among Asia 's best-fed , cleanliest and healthiest people . Once a year every good Maldivian Moslem voluntarily undertakes an act of national service-i.e. , whitewashing a government building . <P> But in time the sons of the Sultanate , sent abroad to Ceylon or Egypt for their education , began to chafe at the strict Sunni Moslem laws which kept them virtual prisoners at home once they reached the throne . When the old Sultan died in the 19305 , the islanders decided to do away with hereditary rule and elect new Sultans by popular vote . The first elected Sultan promptly abdicated . His successor , Prime Minister Amir Didi , was perfectly willing to run the government , but he chafed at the travel restrictions . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to succeed him . <P> Last year the islands voted 99 to 1 to abolish the Sultanate altogether and establish a republic . Amin Didi was unanimously elected first president . Amin , 43 , who visits London twice a year and rules with a firm but fair hand , accepted the job because , as he himself said , he could find no one else as worthy . <P> * Because one 12th century Sultan 's wife was so fond of golden slippers that she threatened to cut off the feet of anyone else who dared wear them .
