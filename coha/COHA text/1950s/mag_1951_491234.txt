THE CITIES OF AMERICA COLORADO SPRINGS By NEIL M. CLARK They used to say Pikes Peak made young people leave home , because the only job to be had was waiting on a millionaire . But this rich man 's playground is now a 12-months-a-year town , with factories that never dirty up the scenery . This is the ninety-fifth of a series of articles on America 's most colorful cities . The next , dealing with Nome , Alaska , will appear in the January 27th issue . OLORADO 'S third-largest city has been called " Playtown , U.S. A. , " the tourist 's paradise , and is n't too happy about it . There can be grief as well as gain in the tourist business . Too many people can come in June , July and August and spend like mad ; too many can stay away the rest of the year and spend nothing . A prominent resident remembers how his dad used to shake his fist at the biggest piece of scenery in sight , Pikes Peak . " You , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls leave home . " He meant that the main thing Colorado Springs had to trade was scenery and climate , and that any Colorado Springs youngster who wanted to grow up and do something besides wait on millionaires , invalids or tourists , almost had to shake off the city 's enchanted dust and get a job in some town that might not have a mountain or a climate , but did pay wages twelve months a year . Lately there has been a solid effort in Colorado Springs to change that . The chamber of commerce had a budget of $37,000 in 1941 ; by 1950 t hat had been upped to $124,921 . The difference is n't being spent , for the most part , on more intensive efforts to coax summer visitors . It is going , instead , into fact collecting and salesmanship aimed at convincing businessmen all the way from Boston to San Diego that Colorado Springs is more than the Broadmoor Hotel and America 's one-stop vacation spot ; that it has , in fact , points worth considering as a place to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , along with the whole mountain area , has suffered from too much dependence industrially on other parts of the country . They say everybody will be better off when the town has industrial dollars as well as tourist dollars . There have been some solid results . A case in point is the New Yorker , William G. Packard , who got pretty tired of riding his horse on the same old bridle paths in Central Park . He was , and is , president of Shephard 's Citations , publishing books for lawyers . During the war , the Government commandeered space , and Packard had to use leftover lofts and offices . Other things irked him . It took employees forty-six minutes , on the average , to get to work . His own home was in Waterbury , Connecticut , and if he went back and forth every day , he traveled about 150 miles : He began to look around to see if there was any place where he could do business better . He took a lot of factors into account and settled for Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handsome building that occupies a whole block , with ample off-the-street parking space . It houses all departments and is located in a pleasant old residential neighborhood with a fine view . Packard says he did n't move to escape high wages , and if he had done so , he would have failed , because he does n't think he gets as much for his wage dollar here as he did in New York . Nevertheless , he considers that it was a smart move . He says that many of his young men and women are prominent in activities here that they could n't even touch the fringes of in New York , and they may have benefited by the climate and a cost of living apparently 1 to 5 per cent under the national average . There are intangible advantages too . His family , he says , is happier , and he thinks most of his 250 employees are , too , and he himself expects to live longer . The main benefit for Colorado Springs , of course , is a year-round payroll . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of these are of the craft type.The city is n't partial to smokestacks ; tourists and residents alike would resent smog and grime . Light industry , however , they think they can handle without making anybody mad . New enterprises since the drive started have brought from 3 to 300 new jobs apiece , totaling about 1200 , with yearly payrolls of some $2,000,000 . For a city which believes it has a population of about 46,000 with perhaps 72,000 in themetropolitan area , that 's not bad . None of the industries are very big , although the military continues to maintain a force of perhaps 5000 men at Camp Carson , and the city 's leaders would love to land the new Air Force academy , which might bring as many more . They think they have about as good a chance of getting it as most of the 250-odd other cities that want it . But by and large , the kind of industries they are aiming at , is medium-sized plants and branches making any of many things . Leaders like Chase Stone and Russell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or medium-sized industries makes better sense than one big one that could leave an awful hole if it quit . The modest but positive success that the industry bringers are having , however , does n't obscure a couple of other facts : One , that a lot of people in Colorado Springs are not anxious to see industries come ; two , that even a lightly industrialized Colorado Springs is not the picture that the average American in Pittsburgh or Chicago carries around with h him . He thinks of it as a city more than a mile high , located where the Plains end and the Rockies begin . If he has been there , he is likely to think of wide streets and handsome landscaped homes , loads of trees and flowers , good hotels and restaurants ; and also , in all probability , he 'll think of a cabin in the mountains nearby , cool forest trails and clean air . Not only the town but also the country around it is what he went to see the first time , and it 's what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Colorado Springs live very well on what they made before they retired and came here to enjoy themselves . L. B. Maytag , the ex-washing-machine man from Newton , Iowa , is one example . Others live well on what they take in from tourists in just a few months each year . The tourist business is a gold mine while it lasts . Often the number of visitors will run as high as 60,000 a day , and an average overnight tourist , even if careful , is likely to spend nine dollars a day on meals , lodging , gas , oil , tires , clothing , groceries and souvenirs ; many spend much more . It adds up . To take care of this dollar influx , the city has forty-two hotels and ninety-six motels and cottage courts in or near the city , and hundreds of people rent their homes or single rooms for the summer or run shops or tourist spots . Tour drivers in particular are busy bees and important business getters for all , overlooking no angles . A regular stop , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , " the driver kids . " Go in . I want you to see that guy throw a pot on the potter 's wheel . " Of course , the trip ends in the salesroom . Probably mom eyes a Damsel of Damascus lamp with a butterfly shade , real butterflies , flowers and grasses inlaid between transparent layers of something , and she thinks how wonderful it would be to have one . How much is it ? . . . Thirty-six dollars and fifty cents . . . . Ouch ! But pop digs down and buys it . Later , the tour driver ( Cont* ed on Page 61 ) COLORADO SPRINGS ( Continued from Page 33 ) gets his cut for bringing them . And although the Van Briggle Pottery employs no regular outside salesmen , all the lamps , howls , vases and ash trays that several dozen employees can produce in twelve months vanish like the wind in three summer months . The outstanding show other than scenery around Colorado Springs is , logically enough , a hotel . The Broad-moor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is also the central feature of a residential suburb developed with winding streets , walled estates , two polo fields and a championship golf course . The eight-story main building , annexes and connected buildings are all set down alongside a man-made lake a mile around . Guests who are conscientious exercisers circle the lake twice , briskly , before dinner . The Broadmoor was dreamed up by a character whom only the Rockies at their gold-rush maddest could have produced . Spencer ( Spec ) Penrose was a Philadelphia-horn Harvard boy who came West green and learned drinking and cussing in the schools where these arts were finally perfected , the Cripple Creek gold camps . He was shrewd with a dollar , and his friends say that one of his main characteristics was his ability to see into the future and project grandiose schemes which , more often than not , paid off . Spec 's cash capital when he arrived is said to have been $500 . He went partners with another Philadelphian , Charles L. Tutt . The Cripple Creek boom was just getting under way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built smelters , and later , in Utah , dug more copper than the Mormons believed was there even when they saw it . The story of sudden wealth most often told about Penrose  --  and it may be true  --  has to do with his famous older brother , Boles , the Pennsylvania senator . It seems that Spec once tried to get Boies to grubstake him . Boles wanted no part of any such scheme . He sent Spec $150 for railroad fare and wrote : " Come on home , you darned fool ! " Several months later Spec walked into his brother 's office and laid down a check for $75,000 . " What 's that ? " Boies asked . " Dividend oneyour grubstake . " " I did n't send you any grubstake . " " Too bad it was n't more than $150 , you darned fool ! " The Broadmoor was opened for business in 1918 . One of Penrose 's associates in building it was young Charles L. Tutt , son of his original partner and BRIT the executive head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the burly shoulders of third-generation William Thayer Tutt ? " Thayer , " not " Bill , " to everybody . Big , friendly and inquisitive , he is infectiously interested in everything about the hotel , whether it 's the latest machine for washing clothes in the laundry , the power plant , the way water is handled in the swimming pool , the paint on the new cog-railway cars for Cheyenne Mountain , or the latest goings on in the hotel greenhouse , where William Hoyne , the manager and an expert plant breeder , lately developed the huge Spencer Penrose red carnation , recent national prize winner and the official flower of Colorado Springs . Probably the word for the Broad-moor is " lavish . " Certainly it is n't austere , though some of the evidences of wealth can scare a poor guy . Penrose traveled a lot and collected whatever hit his fancy . If he found an intricately carved wooden screen in China or a marble fountain in Italy , he had to have it in Colorado Springs . The hotel 's public rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintings , lamps , tables and statues , and nobody knows how much they are worth . They have n't been inventoried or appraised . Neither does anybody on the outside know what the cash investment in the Broadmoor is , nor how much business it does . Those figures are n't made public . What matters most is that the management , tries to think of everything that guests are likely to want to do , and make it simple for them to do it . Play is stressed . You can swim in an outdoor pool protected from the wind by glass and warmed by the sun , so that it can often be used even in winter . In an indoor ice palace you can skate any day of the year . The shops sell almost anything , from bandages to orchids . They 'll outfit you to climb 14,000-foot peaks and ski back down . You play tennis on cork-turf courts , ride , watch rodeos , are chauffeur-driven or hire-car drive yourself to scenic spots , dance to name bands , leave the children in supervised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the social executive , bowl , play pool or polo or go with a congenial group for a chuck-wagon dinner . Snobbery is n't absent , hut some of it is snubbed by letting everyone in on things . You 'll see Colorado Springs kids with two dimes skating in . the ice palace along with hotel guests ' kids . Anybody can swim in the hotel 's two pools for a small fee . The golf club is probably as easy in its cash requirements as any championship course in the country : no initiation fee , ninety dollars a year . Broadmoor prices , by and large , are n't in the economy class ; still , they are n't ridiculous . Single rooms at summer rates fetch twelve to twenty dollars a day , suites from twenty-three to forty-five dollars . These prices include meals and rooms furnished like private luxury apartments . Lean pocketbooks cringe . Yet ostentation for its own sake is n't catered to . Joe Smith and his wife Ethel are made to feel as much at home as Jimmy Stewart or Ike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the lunches in the Tavern for ninety-five cents and a dime tip , and dinners under two bucks . Penrose loved the flamboyant and spectacular , and Colorado Springs would be different if he had n't had the money to put his schemes across . He liked to wear jackets with loud checks , ( Continued on Page 63 ) ( Cone xl fr Page 61 ) Western hats , whipcord riding breeches and riding boots , and he was always planning something breath-taking . Back of the hotel is Cheyenne Moun-tain , 9200 feet high and as steep as a wall . Penrose envisioned a lodge on top for outdoor steak roasts and honey-mooners . He told contractors to name a price for building a road ; they said $200,000 . " Too much ! " he said . He hired bulldozers , dynamiters and fore-men . The road that he worried out cost $400,000 , but most tourists have to see it , for a small toll fee . Halfway up he built a shrine to the sun , dedicated it to Will Rogers and equipped it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  people for twenty miles set their watches by the chimes . Penrose also built one of the best-stocked private zoos in America , reached by road and cog railroad , and it was he who built the Pikes Peak Highway , now operated by the city and used for the Labor Day auto races known as the Pikes Peak Hill Climb . Getting people to the top of Pikes Peak is an important Colorado Springs industry . There are three ways to go : by cog railway , toll highway or afoot . Capt . Zebulon Montgomery Pike , for whom the 14,110-foot mountain is named , never got there himself . It was in the year 1806 that he made his official journey of exploration . He figured the peak to be 18,581 feet high , being a little off on how high the plains were . He did n't try to climb it , because his soldiers were wearing " light overalls and no stockings " and it was November and snowy . It was n't certain that they 'd find game or a practicable way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that Pike claimed the peak would never be climbed . He did n't . But it makes a good story when they hand out the figures on the number who reached the summit last year ? 209,305 by car , 23,000 by cog railway , and nobody knows how many afoot . It was n't until 1871 , sixty-five years after Pike and five years before Colorado was admitted to the Union , that Gen. William J. Palmer founded Colorado Springs . There almost had to be a city of some sort here because of the location . It 's at the foot of the Pass , one of the few easy ways in and out of the mountains  --  Indian trails had centered there for centuries  --  and the mineral springs , with supposed healing properties , were a great attraction . Yet the city would certainly have been very different except for Palmer . Right from the start , he intended it to be " the Saratoga of the West . " Born in Delaware , Palmer had learned railroading on the Pennsylvania , and commanded a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1871 he organized his own company to build the Denver &; Rio Grande Railroad . In the history of the West , that 's a tale . Palmer used narrow-gauge tracks and put them anywhere  --  on a narrow ledge at the bottom of the Royal Gorge or over the top of Fremont Pass at an elevation of 11,328 feet . And the first tracks were from Denver to Colorado Springs , which Palmer planned as his home . He laid out automobile-width streets before the automobile was invented . Nowadays , in the heart of town , on Pikes Peak Avenue , cars can angle-park on both sides and still leave six traffic lanes . The other principal streets are just as wide , and many of them have parkways all through town . In the beginning , the 10,000-acre site for the city was hopelessly dreary , but Palmer dug into his own pocket to make it bloom with trees , flowers and grass . Plenty of Western cities got their start in a bar , a brothel or a brawl , but not . Colorado Springs . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquors could be manufactured or sold on the premises . Instead , afternoon tea was drunk out of English china before the city was a year old , and the polo fields in the shadow of Pikes Peak were soon known from London to Newport . General Palmer 's own house was a baronial castle in a craggy canyon known as Glen Eyrie , and the stones for his fireplace were imported . Everything about Colorado Springs was going to be just hoop-de-doo for cultured and civilized people with money . That the city was pretty well saved from such a la-di-da fate was probably due in large part to the sudden eruption of Cripple Creek in 1891 . That was so close at hand that it made the dainty antimacassars in Cascade Avenue parlors shiver and shake . It was practically a Colorado Springs boom . Hubert Howe Bancroft , historian of the West , whose Colorado volume was published in 1890 , closed his chapter on Colorado Springs by saying that the city had about 10,000 people and was a modest commercial center ; but , said he , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as appeal to invalids and valetudinarians , who , in ever-increasing numbers , here find the climate for which they have sought the world over , and the social order incident to a refined and cultured community . " That was in 1890 . The next Januuary , a cowboy named Bob Womack got thirsty ... awful dry . He forked his pony and rode down from the hills , liquoring up along the way . Colorado Springs was decorously asleep when he rode through the streets , yipping and emptying his gun , and next day everybody knew that he claimed he had found gold somewhere along the creek where they pulled the cow out of the muck and broke her leg  --  Cripple Creek , they called it . From then on , events in Colorado Springs , as well as more and more of the characters in it , began to get slightly dizzy . Many dug gold in the hills ; others sold gold shares . Colorado Springs at one time had two stock exchanges dealing in mining stocks , and in one year 236 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were immensely rich . The precious stuff lay almost at the grass roots . Miners claimed they dug it with pitchforks . Over fifteen square miles it seemed to lie layers deep almost everywhere . Two Colorado Springs druggists , A. D. Jones and J. K. Miller , tossed a hat in the air and began digging where it fell ; that was the start of the rich Pharmacist Mine . In places , a single ton of ore yielded values of $100,000 . One miner . who could n't pay his grocery bill in cash settled it with his half interest in a claim . The grocer sold it to a schoolteacher , who opened a vein that produced $13,000,000 . Many a character later famous worked obscurely in Cripple Creek or grew up there when the boom was on , including Jack Johnson , Jack Dempsey , Texas Guinan and Lowell Thomas . One character , however , emerged above the rest with more money and glamour , and his exploits were mighty important for Colorado Springs . This wasWinfield ScottStratton , an I nd ianaborn carpenter who reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could knock rocks every summer , in a vain hunt for gold . For nineteen years he got poorer and poorer . Then he heard about Womack 's discovery , believed in it , and on the following Fourth of July broke into pay dirt . Some years later he sold that first claim , called the Independence , to a London corporation for 2,000,000 pounds , about $10,000,000 . Stratton turned out to be the kind of rich man Colorado Springs needed to save it from a stiff neck . He had never taken part in the city 's la-di-da social life , and did n't start . He built no millionaire 's palace on Wood Avenue . True , he had always wished for a pair of shiny boots like General Palmer 's , so he bought himself some , but to the day he died he kept up his dues in the carpenters ' union , and his best friend continued to be Bob Schwarz , a Swiss shoemaker who had once lent him $500 to do the assessment work on a claim that petered out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The oddest thing about him was his notion that his wealth should be used where he hats made it , to do somebody some good . This shocked the pomp-and-party people . One day , they say , Stratton was sitting on a garbage can at a downtown street corner , dreaming or just tired , when he looked up and noticed a man he knew across the street . He jumped up and hurried over , clapped the man on the back and urged him to step inside the bank . Two minutes later the friend was $5000 richer . Ironically , the man was Bob Womack , discoverer of the Cripple Creek bonanza field . Though his find had started dozens of people ? including Stratton  --  on the road to great wealth , Womack himself had never managed to collect much ready cash on it . That $5000 probably came in pretty handy . Stratton bought the site for the city hall that Colorado Springs is proud of now , and gave it to the city . He bought the site for the post office and sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the deal for the county courthouse . A lot of his money was invested in downtown real estate . Some $800,000 , spent within the last year or so modernizing Stratton-owned business buildings , gives the heart of the city a markedly new look , architecturally . But what really knocked the silk hats off was the will Stratton made . Nearly all of his money was left to build and run the best poorhouse in America . Colorado Springs kicked like a steer at having to have a thing like that , but there was n't much they could do about it . Today the Myron Stratton Home takes in old couples of the county who did n't lay away enough to keep themselves when their earning days ended , and puts them up in modern brick houses that anybody would be proud of . It cares for single old men and women , too , and lengthens their lives by relieving them of worry and giving them good food and medical care . And it takes in local orphaned kids and gives them home training , school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. ( Dave ) Strickler is the man largely responsible for carrying out Stratton 's desires . As soon as Stratton died , in 1902 , the buzzards settled down to pick his estate clean . Strickler was the chief lawyer for the estate from 1906 on , and he fought and won classic legal battles in that cause . He is a character in his own right . He is absent-minded and has trouble with his false teeth . Once in court his uppers dropped out . " Pardon me , your honor , " he said , unperturbed , " while I find my damn teeth . " Once at lunch with friends , he was called to the phone just as the waitress brought his plate . His friends removed the clean plate and substituted a dirty one . He returned , saw the dirty plate , assumed he had eaten , dropped a dime for the girl and left . But he is in no way absent-minded on things having to do with the Myron Stratton Home . The trustees , of whom he is president , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows assets of $6,625,427.59 . Income only is used to maintain the home , and the value of the estate has grown . There is no figure on that balance sheet to show the human misery that Stratton 's money has alleviated . Colorado Springs is a self-conscious city , probably because of having so many out-of-town visitors . Somebody is always wanting a picture . Every place with a view is named  --  Indian Head , Kissing Camels and Steamboat Rock are just a few . Glasses are trained on points of interest . Interesting old railroad engines are saved and put in parks , with tablets . The spot where Pike is supposed to have looked at his peak is a sort of shrine . A park outside of town , called the Garden of the Gods , is supposed to be entered with awe . A young lady from England made the definitive crack about that seventy-eight years ago . " Were I a divinity , " she said , " I certainly would not choose to dwell there . " Operating under a home-rule clause in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councilmen who choose one of their number for mayor and hire a manager . The present mayor , James N. McCullough , operates the Village Inn , an outstanding eating place in a city where the restaurant business rates high . Kenneth Card , city manager , has been in office only a year , but was in chamber-of-commerce work and knows the city-hall score.The city goes in for municipal ownership of utilities and does a workmanlike job . Card likes to report that a city-wide paving job was carried out without tax money ; the funds came from unneeded reserves from utility operations . For some time the city had no bonded indebtedness ; now it is in debt for only about half the legal limit . Police Chief Irvin B. ( Dad ) Bruce is the city 's best-known official . His friends are all over the globe . He will tear up a parking ticket , but he 'll throw the book at an obstreperous drunken driver who " knows " somebody . Dad is host this year to the International Association of Police Chiefs , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and public-recreation program are outstanding . The auditorium was built in 1923 and was meant to be the usual stuffy place for big shindigs . But somebody thought it was a shame for stone and steel worth $500,000 to be idle most of the time ; as a result , it is doubtful whether any city-owned auditorium anywhere is so continuously used . There are the usual convention meetings , political rallies , garden-club meetings . In addition , the auditorium has been known to accommodate as many as forty-five square-dance sets at a time , no telling how many checker players , and from November first to April first it is Harmony Hall , a teenage center , with a snack bar , motion pictures , table games , rifle range and evening parties . The outdoor-recreation program provides tables in the parks for chess , checkers , dominoes and whist , shuffleboard courts , golf , band concerts , community sings , church services and a lot more . The city sponsors thirty-three kinds of team and nonteam sports . Softball led in 1949 in popularity , with 188 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . The city has perhaps more than its share of facilities for caring for the sick , and one of its boasts is that many a Colorado Springs businessman , husky now , came to town years ago expecting to live only a few months . A healthy climate is one of the things they count on to bring industries . For those in need of them , there are hospitals , sanatoria , a cancer clinic , and about one physician or surgeon for each 370 of the city 's population . The new Colorado Springs Medical Clinic , started after the war by eight young specialists who had been in the service and did n't want to go back to practice in Evanston , Illinois , treated 18,900 patients in three and a half years . Cultural high lights are the ninety-piece symphony orchestra , Colorado College , and the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center , a $2,000,000 institution designed for all the arts , and aiming , among other things , " to give every child in the city an opportunity to enjoy and appreciate art from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for **26;3943;TOOLONG . Socially , Colorado Springs has shaken down to a sort of free-and-easy attitude . There is still a polo-playing set , but most people do n't play and do n't care . There are some interesting clubs , including the El Paso , old and dignified , and the Cooking Club , small and ' convivial , started by Penrose . The AdAmAn Club is famous , but not so social . Its big job is to set off fireworks on New Year 's Eve from the top of Pikes Peak , and to add one member a year , from which it gets its name . Home building today does n't show boom signs , but goes on steadily at a high level because people keep coming and staying . Many soldiers who trained here came back to live . Thousands of tourists register for jobs , and if they find something before they leave , they stay . It is said that a girl on thirty-five dollars a week can house herself very nicely with another girl in an apartment renting for forty dollars a month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern , can be had for $62.50 ; two bedrooms , eighty dollars . A few rent for $100 . In the year 1951 , Colorado Springs is earnestly trying to remain a nice place to live and still be a good place to earn a living all year . Some things favor that , others do n't . Transportation is favorable , with three air lines , five railroads , three United States highways and many bus lines . The geographical location is quite central in measured air miles . The climate is almost all that is claimed for it . There are 310 average days of sunshine , 12.1 inches of precipitation , not much hot weather , few bad winds , low relative humidity , and on opening day at the baseball park it 's just as likely to snow four inches . Less favorable factors are the distance from the center of population , lack of balanced raw-material supplies , unfavorable freight rates . Union wages are a little lower than the national average in some trades , higher in of hers . Water is a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the great American desert . " They brag about their water in Colorado Springs , with reason . It comes from snow fields , is stored in reservoirs at a 9000-foot elevation , and when you look down on all that water from the top of Pikes Peak , there seems to be a lot of it . In Colorado Springs itself it 's cheap enough so that many people leave their hoses running all day . Over the line in some of the suburbs , some people say they ca n't get any pressure in second-floor bathrooms . In any case , what water there is belongs to somebody . The water in the lake back of the Broadmoor does n't belong to the Broadmoor , but to the Stratton estate . There are plans for bringing more water through the Continental Divide . Students of the water situation , such as Russell Law , the banker , say , with an " if " or two , that they see enough water ahead for a population of perhaps 100,000 . Beyond that , maybe .

CONFESSIONS OF A REFORMED JAllMAN ( Continued from Page 21 ) too much anyway , as he only fronted the hand , throwing his sticks in the air like crazy . One memorable day , however , he petulantly insisted on being allowed to attend a rehearsal . He was glumly playing offbeat when he suddenly noticed a trumpet laying out a few bars . Shouting for a halt , the leader pointed at the offending trumpet , demanding to know why he just sat there . The arranger said coldly that the trumpet was supposed to lay out eight bars , period . And the leader screamed , " Then write somethin ' in for him ! In this band everybody works ! " Like all musicians , I strongly avoided being caught , in the dazzling light of day , and developed a fine ashen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By working at it I became almost as much a hypochondriac as the better reeds , and I soon discovered one other little item that will prevent my ever winning the Congressional Medal . Most musicians , like Jacques Renard , are afraid of only two things  --  anything that moves or breathes . A fine violinist , Jacques Renard had the misfortune to back a show topped by Morton Downey . And on closing night Downey graciously insisted that Renard hold down a solo spot himself . Touched and flattered , Renard found himself under the one spotlight on the ' darkened stage , and not until he lifted his violin did he discover that Mr. Downey had thoughtfully greased his bow with Limburger cheese . Gallantly sweating his way through it , Renard managed to get through the piece by keeping his nose as far from the fiddle as possible . When he came offstage , ashen with rage , Downey threw his arms around him and begged to be forgiven . Renard finally relented and , reaching into his pOcket for a handkerchief to wipe his trembling brow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while embracing him , had put a small trout in his pocket . Life with Vallee was young and gay , but . I was growing more and more aware that if he ever lost his voice my own career was ended . Leaving him , I set up shop in my own right , handling assorted bands that thought , they might use my curious talents . For a while I even acquired a small reputation as a band doctor . Wearing a derby and a knowing look , I would then be retained to overhaul a band when , for private reasons , the leader did n't want to fire anyone personally . This , however , was a bit of a dead-end street , for the better leaders not only fired men themselves but very frequently threw them into the street with their music right after them . The life of a band manager may sound like a giddy one , but at times it can be very rugged indeed . As proof of this , let me cite Mr. Carlos Gastel , who once handled a band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were tearing up old times not long ago , and Mr. Gastel got to brooding about his association with a well-known fighter . " I had this band nobody would hire , " he said , " and I know I got to hang a name up there to draw a few tourists . The first name that comes to mind is this fighter . So I hustle myself up to his home town and 1 sign him . It 's not enough that I get him but I have to take his kid brother , who is as big as he is , and the fighter thinks it would be kind of cute if the brother sings with the band . " From the night we go out we do nothing but lay eggs . The pug do n't know any more about music than I do about skipping rope , and we 're dead from the start . The fighter liked to wave that stick all right , but he could n't have found a beat in broad daylight . So I tell him whenever he gets stuck to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the beat from them . Only thing wrong was that the boys were n't taking any chances making him mad . Whenever he went off beat , they went right with him and they stayed there . And all the time , you tkrlerstand , his brother is singing off key . " Every band manager gradually acquires the reputation of a Hard-Hearted Hannah . It was in Louisville , Kentucky , that I acquired what still passes in the trade as a dubious fame . I was with a top name band when we played a Derby Eve date there . Our leader was right out of a deck of cards , a real tonsil artist who doubled as a health lover , specializing in sun lamps , high-protein diets and vitamins . He was a rugged believer in the simple life , and his reputation grew so monstrous as he went his buttermilk way that soon very few free souls could be lured into the band at any price . " You tell the boys how it is , " he ordered me at the dance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our car tacked on a milk train that . pulls out at five . It 'll get us in Evansville in plenty of time for tomorrow 's onenighter . Instead of getting hung over tonight , they 'll just wake up in Evansville , and we 'll all go for a nice walk in the afternoon . " I passed the bad word along , and the band took it the hard way . But not until I checked them in at the station did I find the whole reed section had taken a powder . While I was seeing to it that our Nature Boy was
