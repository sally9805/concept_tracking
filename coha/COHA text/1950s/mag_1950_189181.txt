When they are good , the black-tied judges at indoor track meets look very , very good , but when they are bad-as they were two weeks ago , at the Wanamaker Mile in Madison Square Garden-they look horrid . At the Wanamaker tape the photofinish crew took a picture that showed several fat official rumps blocking the camera 's view of the cat's-whisker finish between Don Gehrmann and Fred Wilt . The judges , relying on their own eyes , deadlocked 2 to 2 , and Chief Judge Asa Bushnell , voting himself , declared Gehrmann the winner . <P> Last week , 13 days after the race , the Metropolitan A.A.U. Registration Committee reversed the judges . As the committee read the rule book , neither Chief Judge Bushnell nor a third-place judge who voted for Gehrmann had had the technical right to vote at all . That gave the Wanamaker Mile to Fred Wilt . <P> The decision suited Wilt . Said he : " I know I hit the tape first . " Don Gehrmann , who had taken the $500 silver cup back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I still maintain I hit the tape first and it wrapped around my neck . " Since there were at least two higher A.A.U. echelons that could be appealed to , there was a good chance that the Wanamaker Mile might be running all winter .
