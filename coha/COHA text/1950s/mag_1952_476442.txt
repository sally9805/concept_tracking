THE new converts to freedom are giving literature the grimmest and most com-pelling adventure stories it has ever known . Their confessionals , when they turn at long last from darkness at noon in Koestlerian voyages , keep our eyes popping , our hair on end . Arranging themselves before the great flawed mirrors of history they make tragic yet commanding figures of supernal importance , towering from the crime to the sublime . It is unthinkable not to be moved by the eloquent repentance of those who have danced for despotism in one decade and denounced it in the next , impossible to cast the first stone . All have a single , grievously documented story to tell : Tyranny is hell upon earth . Most people know as much without undergoing such harrowing experiences . Why , then , do we undergo those experiences vicariously ; why should we read them again , and again , and again ? The answers are three : First , because we are aware that these books discuss a clear and present danger ? even though the books keep telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asleep to the peril of totalitarianism . Second , because we want to know what made the authors finally change to the side of liberty . Third , because the narratives are lit with unearthly flames of adventure , astounding chases through the lower depths of treason , sudden torture , and slow death . In these lies a terrible narrative power Within the field there are many varieties . Three stand out right now . One is Life and Death in Soviet Russia ( Putnam , $3.50 ) by Valentin Gonzales , the famous Spanish Loyalist general known as El Campesino , who learned as a Communist that the choice was between dying on his feet before Franco or living on his knees before Stalin . Another is - Whittaker Chambers ' Witness ( Random House , $5 ) , bound to be the most discussed hook of the year , a vast , Wagnerian story of a profoundly tortured lifetime climaxed by the Hiss-Chambers case , the duel between two Quakers . A non-Communist third is George Orwell 's Homage to Catalonia ( Harcourt , Brace , $3.50 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Front ? that famous opportunity for men of good will to be cozened by the Communists as a sort of prelude to being devoured at leisure . After finding out what the Communists were really up to in Spain , Orwell put down his grisly vision of the future , Nineteen Eighty-Four . Others Held the Fort F ATHOMS deep in these books it is hard not to forget that in those same years other people were leading very different lives and in their own ways holding the fort for freedom . We shall come to them presently , particularly to Robert Lewis Taylor 's fine new book about Winston Churchill , who did his share in maintaining a faith that millions never lost , and were as ready to die for , unassumingly , as those who went baring after totalitarian gods . These books , however , do not raise the question the converts do , which is : If a confession helps the cause of freedom , should others go and sin so they in turn can come out and help freedom some more ? El Campesino was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary Communist man of talk . He was a tremendous fighter in the Spanish civil war , and the Solshie bureaucrats built him up as a folk hero . When lie turned against them , they tore him down . First , however , they used him , or tried to use him , in the purges and terrors whose beginnings Orwell saw in Catalonia . He was cast as the fall guy to show that only the Communists could hold Teruel . The plan miscarried but the Popular Front was split wide open and anyway the Loyalists lost the war . Still a useful hero , Campesino was welcomed in Russia with more than the usual propaganda fireworks ? but told to mind his p 's and q 's . He could never do that , and when he was asked to inform against his friends he grew furious . One thing led to another , until it occurred to him that under his new Russian name , Piotr Antonovich , he was being trained as an oppressor . And when he charged that the Spanish Communist party had directed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't make things any easier for him . The long ordeal of degradation and torture began . Indeed , no man who has escaped from Soviet Russia in recent years has brought out with him a more searing story than Campesino 's . Only he could have survived so many different deaths between Teruel and the Persian border , one feels . And then one remembers others . The Trial and the Witness THE ordeal that Whittaker Chambers went through , on the other hand , is often forgotten in violent arguments as to whether he really was or was not a nicer man than Alger Hiss . He has his day in Witness , however , and I do n't see how even his most scornful enemies can fail to be moved by it , as they were moved by the plight of Hiss , in compassion .. It is Chambers who sees the two of them , objectively , in this passage from his book , at the climax : " As hour by hour the agony mounted , died away and mounted again , point by damning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of how much each of us was the prey , rather than an actor , in this historic experience to which what had been best in us had led us , from motives incomprehensible to most of those who watched or heard us , to this end . " That is the kind of passage that sticks in the mind more deeply than page after page of verbatim testimony in this very long , very skillfully written book , covering communism , farming , family , and life at Time . One of the things that must remain , as Chambers says , incomprehensible , is how members of an underground conspiracy group could know each other well , live in each other 's houses , go on trips together , and yet not know each other 's full names . You 'd think the ordinary habits of espionage would take care of that . Much more comprehensible are the scars that were left on Chambers by a desperately unhappy childhood and early family life . He went into communism at the height of this nation 's prosperity , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his generation were having a better time , by far , than any American generation has had before or since . Thus , for once , the Depression is not given credit for the invitation to that dance of death . It was a conviction that the world was going to hell in a handbasket . The evil of communism finally drove him out , after many violent experiences in the underworld of treason and terror where communism operates , out of sight of the publicly known members and most of their fellow-travelers . To me , one of the most callous things in this book of revelations is the place where one out of many clandestine meetings was held in Washington . It was Arlington National Cemetery , above the graves of men who died fighting for their country . Prelude in Spain GEORGE ORWELL 'S Homage to Catalonia is an account of his adventures as a volunteer in an Anarchist outfit during the Spanish civil war and a personal testament to the way the Communists marched to their disastrous power in Barcelona . It was published in England while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth came out , so that it has the rare interest of true prophecy seen in retrospect . The hook is not flawless . An erratum note found in Orwell 's papers after his death , for example , clears a fairly important error in confusing the Assault Guards with the Civil Guards . But Orwell 's capacity for describing action in terse , cantless prase never showed to better advantage . And one can see how his satire on Stalin 's totalitarianism , Animal Farm , as well as Nineteen Eighty-Four , grew Irons roots in this book . " I had the ineradicable English belief that ' they ' can not arrest you unless you have broken the law , " he remarks in describing the **27;743;TOOLONG in Barcelona , and adds that it is a most dangerous view to hold during a political purge . Yet that English belief in a man 's rights under the law was to save a good many hides in the years ahead . The Worlds of Winston Churchill W inston Churchill : An informal Study of Greatness , by Robert Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertaining and the most revealing collection of Churchillian anecdotes ever assembled in one book , and probably the most human biography we shall ever have of the great man , to hoot . Once in a while I grew a little uneasy while reading it . As the good stories clattered on at a bantering , cantering pace , I felt like a diner at a banquet who glances out of the corner of his eye to see how the guest of honor is taking all the toastmaster 's admiring persiflage . Once in a while I got the distinct feeling that Mr. Churchill might reach out and pin Mr. Taylor 's ears back . But the feeling soon passed . For Mr. Taylor has obviously done a formidable amount of research to put this book together , and the whole story is here . - " It is engrossing but idle to ponder the probable course of England , " Mr. Taylor writes , had a headstrong young Winston Churchill fallen in the terrible cavalry charge at Omdurman . " It is not fantastic to suggest , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of either a German or a Russian gauleiter , and that mankind would he much farther advanced on its determined return to all-fours . " A man who offended Churchill with a tedious story was told : " I predict that you will go far ? in the wrong direction . " When he heard that suffragettes were chaining themselves to railings in the park , and would stay till they got the vote , he suggested that a gentleman might just as well " chain himself to the railings of St. Thomas Hospital and say he would n't move until he has had a baby . " While persons who have since recanted were still finding utterable beauties in the Bolshevik state , he was impaling " the bestial appetites of Leninism . " In a short burst of spare time he once wrote a novel about high doings and low plots in a mythical state , called Savrola . It netted about $3,500 . " I have consistently urged my friends to abstain from reading it , " Mr. Churchill later said , a novel point of view for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the Atlantic Charter session , he read C. S. Forester 's Captain Horatio Hornblower , and he has probably enjoyed the latest in that exuberantly anachronistic series , Lieutenant Hornblower ( Little , Brown , $3.50 ) , which takes us on a spirited expedition to the Spanish Main . A Graham Greene Omnibus AN OTFIER excellent-book of adventure is Three by Graham Greene ( Viking , $3.95 ) , which is highly recommended for your summer reading if you do not already know the three novels it contains : The Ministry of Fear , The Confidential Agent , and This Gun for Hire . And a book you may want to consult carefully before you start on your holiday travels is The Columbia Lippincott Gazeteer of the World ( Columbia University Press ? Lippincott , $50 ) , edited by Leon E. Seltzer . This is a miraculously useful volume to have around at all times , though I imagine it would rather overbalance your baggage allowance on any plane , since it is the size and weight of a well-nourished cornerstone . And it seems to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from a column and a half on London , three and a half columns on Spain , four and a half columns on Mexico , the state of Mexico , and the city of Mexico , to four lines on Rocquencourt ( " agr . village ( ( pop . 117 ) ) , Seine-et-Oise dept. , N central France just NW of Versailles . Military hq. of North Atlantic Treaty Organization was established here , 1951 " ) , and the same amount of space on Mount Eisenhower in Alberta ( " Renamed 1946 from Castle Mtn . " ) . " Romancing over a Bottle " imn to consult the British Who 's 1 Who to find out anything about that mysterious novelist , Henry Green , whose new book is Doting ( Viking , $3 ) . Mr. Green , it seems , is the managing director of an engi , necring company in Birmingham , a fact that must amuse him when he notes that Iit'ry critics find him too fine a stylist for their simple tastes ; he is also an Oxford man and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his recreation ? " Romancing over the bottle , to a good band , " according to Who 's Who , which is sure enough of itself to permit a light touch , and that 's precisely what Doling is about . In fact , it would have made a good subtitle for this novel , a rueful , brilliant satire on a man at the dangerous age , somewhat in love with a young girl and head over heels in love with the idea that he is appallingly misunderstood by his wife . She knows all , and expertly turns the tables on him ? as well as a few incidental cartwheels of her own . The story is told entirely in dialogue , some of the best dialogue that anyone is writing today . Presenting Wilkie Collins N A more Victorian mood , read ' Wilkie Collins ( Macmillan , $4.50 ) , by Kenneth Robinson , a first-rate biography of the strange and gifted friend of Charles Dickens who wrote those two masterpieces of chilling adventure , The Woman in White and The Moonstone , both of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the great tradition of the English eccentrics , given more to saying what he thought than considering what he should say , making sweeping judgments and cheerful atonements , plowing through triumph and disaster with humor and urbanity . Occasionally , though , these gifts almost failed him , as when lie was trying to tell Hawthorne 's son how much he admired The Scarlet Letter . " Even the second volume , where most novelists weaken , is fine , " Collins said , with imprudent generosity , and the third fulfills the splendid promise of the first . " Young Hawthorne was unkind enough to suggest , at this point , that The Scarlet Letter was strictly a one-volume work . " Pardon me ! Three volumes , and large ones ! " said Collins , and marched to his bookcase , where the single volume be discovered seemed to baffle him , as well it might . Then he rallied : " You are right . One volume and not over seventy thousand words in all ! It is incomprehensible ! Such a powerful impression in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IACOMO PucciN ? , who wrote " Tosca , " " Boheme , " " Madame Butterfly , " " The Girl of the Golden West , " and so on , also had a pretty nimble wit , which is well exhibited in Dante del Fiorentino 's Immortal Bohemian ( Prentice-Hall , $3.50 ) , an exuberant , intimate , imaginative memoir , as full of adventures in love and tragedy and uproars as one of Puccini 's operas . Father Dante , who grew up near Puccini in Lucca and knew his whole life like a well-liked score , says that " next to music , beautiful women , and the Tuscan earth , " Puccini liked speed , particularly in motor cars and motor boats . Once he saw just the boat he instantly knew he had wanted all his life , in a Fifth Avenue window . The trouble was that it cost $3,000 and the notion of spending so much money for it seemed strikingly disloyal to a lifelong romance he conducted with the goddess of thrift , whoever she may be . It seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would look better in engraved deeds to land , or negotiable securities . Nevertheless , the boat continued to speed through his dreams , waking as well as sleeping , apparently , for one night at a Vanderbilt party in his honor he met a distinguished banker ( all bankers in stories like these are patrons of the arts ) who said it was his ambition to own an original score by Puccini . What occupied his dream spaces at the moment , it turned out , was his favorite passage in music , Musetta 's waltz in " Boheme . " Arid he made it clear that he would pay welI for a copy of it in Puccini 's own handwriting . " Would you , " Puccini ventured to say , possibly just to keep the conversation urbanely alive , " pay three thousand dollars for it ? " " Yes , " said the banker , without batting an eye . " Then you shall have it , " said Puccini . " I will write it out and bring it to you tomorrow . " The boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girl of the Golden West . " BOOKS IN BRIEF By Katherine Gauss Jackson FICTION Who Walk in Darkness , by Chandler Brossard . With a little inattention to book titles mentioned in the text , specific prize-fight dates , etc. , it would be easy to read this modern novel as a Greenwich Village Depression novel of the early thirties . There is no hint that anything new goes on in the world . Here is a familiar lot of unemployed drifters ( too proud to work ? ) : the same dolce far niente attitude , and a central preoccupation with matters no more important than who is to buy the next round of drinks and where the next easy woman is to be found . There are two characters who have a minor sense of decency , but even for them the greatest use for courage seems to consist in publicly denying any decent motives they may privately hold . ... There are fine descriptions and fine feeling about New York , for which the author seems to have more affection than for any of his characters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of young people ? pseudo - " intellectuals " ? is choosing to live in a world of Korean war , the United Nations , and national mobilization , not to mention the cultural interests ( besides prize fights ) that New York has to offer , I do n't believe they are a very significant group . They influence nobody . They interest nobody . If they are important , the Russians might as well step in tomorrow and who will care ? New Directions , $2.75 Flee the Angry Strangers , by George Mandel . A non-Greenwich Village New Yorker reading the novel noted above and then this one can only feel gratitude at the city 's diversity ; a relief to be living in sonic other part of it . And many Villagers will not recognize their own part . Yet the authors make the point that only in the Village does one find such a cross-section of all kinds of life . And these two authors are concerned with the more miserable characters , even in the Village , Mr. Brossard with the intellectually perverted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of the two , Mr. Mandel 's hook is the more credible , for all its sordidness . Here are people fighting against their doom , especially Diane , the seventeen-year-old mother of an illegitimate child . The author has endowed her with beauty and a childish grace as well as a stark and believable terror of the world , and the reader cares about her and about some of the staunch characters who try to help her . The story has universal human dimensions . . . . But there is just too much of it : many too many scenes in the dives of the fallen where the same doomed people carry on the same doomed conversations time after time .. No matter how well reported , they are dull . In fact the better they are reported , the duller they are . For the purposes of the novel a little more suggestion and a little less delineation would have brought it to its moving and inevitable conclusion sooner and better .                 @ @ @ @
