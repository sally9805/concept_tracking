Germany was the main point of attack in Russia 's peace offensive , but there were also a couple of smart flanking movements southward : <P> <P> Yugoslavia . Marshal Tito announced that the Soviet Union has requested an exchange of ambassadors . " Russia smiled on us , " said Communist Tito , " but they will not blind us with the smiles . I personally can never believe 100% in the Soviet Union . I wait for them to show their intentions in practice . I do not believe in their words . " <P> <P> The fine words were largely for the West 's benefit . Yugoslavia wants normal relations with Russia , and will accept the offer , Tito went on to say . Since his 1948 break with Russia , the air has been filled with angry Communist lingo over which Communist has the true faith , but Western observers in Yugoslavia generally agree that 1 ) Tito is and will stay a Communist , 2 ) his principal quarrel was with Stalin personally , 3 ) he would be happy to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . In fact , Tito complained sadly last week , frontier incidents have actually increased since Stalin 's death , and he accused the Russians of " directing their satellites on us while they smile at us . " Tito 's interpretation of the Soviet move : a desire to correct policy , but not aims . Having once taken the path of imperialism , the Russians can not change without difficulty , he said . <P> Austria . High Commissioner V. P. Sviridov , a soldier , was replaced by Ambassador I. I. Ilyichev , a civilian . Russian zone check points were abolished , and it was announced that goods could be freely shipped in and out of the zone . Control of the uncompleted Ybbs-Persenbeug power plant , held as a frozen German asset , was returned to Austria . The Russians promised swift release of Austrian prisoners of war and an amnesty for kidnaped civilians , and agreed to withdraw a couple of Communist cops who had been fired by the Austrian government but kept on by the Russians . <P> <P> After seven years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one town there was dancing in the streets as they tore up their interzonal passes . But there was still no hint that the Russians were prepared to turn over the administration of former German property , relax their severe censorship or pay their own occupation costs as the U.S. is doing . There was no suggestion that they were ready to sign an Austrian peace treaty , for that would involve withdrawing 50,000 Red army troops , but they apparently hoped to get credit for generosity with out treaty . With a tactical finesse , they had kept their month-long negotiations with the Austrians a close secret ; last week 's developments came as a complete surprise to U.S. occupation authorities in Austria . <P>
