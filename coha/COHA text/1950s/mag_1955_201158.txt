West Germany has won its airline ; soon it will have its planemakers at work . Focke-Wulf , famed for its fighters , hopes to be the first to take off ; it announced last week that it will start immediate production of Germany 's first postwar powered aircraft : the Bl 502 , a small single-engined liaison plane . <P> Grounded by Allied decree since the war 's end , the planemakers got permission to build aircraft ( except strategic bombers and guided missiles ) when Germany regained its sovereignty last May . The industry is badly hampered by a lack of capital and by the fact that many of its big plants and best brains are in East Germany . In the beginning , it will concentrate on small planes and components , building many under license from U.S. and other foreign manufacturers . To help one another through the rough early years , German planemakers are forming four cartel-like groups , through which they will work together and divvy up orders . <P> Among the planemakers likely to play big roles in the reborn industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repairing U.S. Army trucks , making midget cars ( TIME , Sept. 19 ) and sewing machines while running an aircraft-designing bureau in Spain , is readying his Augsburg plant ( sewing machines ) for plane production . He has several planes on his drawing board , including a four-engined cargo carrier , hopes within a year to be employing 2,500 in aircraft alone v. 2,100 in all his ventures now . <P> Bomber Builder Claudine Dornier , whose plants employed over 15,000 in 1944 , has also been making midget cars while he stayed airborne with a design company in Spain . It has designed and built prototypes of the Do 27 , a light observation plane for the Spanish government . In about a year , Dornier plans to start producing the Do 27 in Germany for the private plane market . <P> Ernst Heinkel , who had lost all but one of his plants when the war ended , has been turning out small motors , midget cars . He has started hiring back some of his old designing staff , including Siegfried ( " Dixi " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Bayerische Motoren Werke , which built the world 's first mass-produced jet engine during the war , since then has rebuilt U.S. Army vehicles , now produces motorcycles and passenger cars . Last year B.M.W. set up a division to study jet propulsion ; it has now gathered together all its old planning , design and production teams , hopes to start by producing U.S. jet engines under license .
