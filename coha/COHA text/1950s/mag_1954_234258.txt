Once there was a young man who went to knight school . His name was Gawaine le Coeur-Hardy , but he was not very brave or even very bright . When the other students went to jousting class , Gawaine would hide in the woods . At last the headmaster gave up and told him to take the snap course in dragon-slaying . Gawaine was delighted , and spent the rest of his school days hacking at the model dragon on the south meadow . On commencement day , the headmaster gave Gawaine a magic word ( " Rumplesnitz " ) and sent him forth to slay real live dragons . The very next day , Gawaine said the good word to a lavender dragon , and with a biff of his battle-axe , cut off the creature 's head . <P> After that there was no stopping Gawaine . He slew dragons all over the place , as many as three a day , until he had slain 49 . Alas , success went to his head . He took to drink , and whenever he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happened that Gawaine met up with his 50th dragon . . . <P> The 51st Dragon , taken from the text by the late Heywood Broun , is the second cartoon in U.P.A. 's ( United Productions of America ) series of comic legends for moderns . Like the first , an animation of James Thurber 's Unicorn in the Garden ( TIME , Oct. 26 ) , it is a nasal little ballad that ends with a sly intellectual hiccup . The admirers of Donald Duck and Woody Woodpecker and Porky Pig are not likely to be broken up with hilarity . Still , it is refreshing to laugh at an idea instead of an oink , and the kidding of medieval styles in art is cleverly done . And yet the danger does begin to appear , in a kind of sterile facility in many of the drawings , that U.P.A. could easily be caught in its cleverness , as Disney and his imitators were in their treacle .                    @
