On a 692-station radio and television hookup last week , President Eisenhower addressed himself to all the people of the U.S. He spoke as the political leader of the Republican Party , and he spoke on behalf of the Republican Party candidates for Congress . In so doing , he gave renewed proof that , when he permits himself to be , he is a highly effective politician . <P> Ike 's speech originally was scheduled as a routine appeal to get out the vote . He was persuaded to let out the political stops by G.O.P. bigwigs , who were in and out of Denver all week with doleful reports of Republican chances . Their pessimism was backed by a Gallup poll , which indicated that , outside the South , Republican congressional candidates hold only a 51% to 49% lead-and a 55% G.O.P. vote outside the South is considered necessary for control of Congress . The day of his speech Ike spent long hours going over campaign strategy with top Republicans , who had been summoned to Denver . <P> Before the President uttered a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this was to be a strictly Republican occasion ; Ike posed with G.O.P. leaders flanking him on either side ; he was introduced by an ebullient Vice President Richard Nixon , who loped onto the stage . In his first nine sentences , the President mentioned the Republican Party five times . <P> The Past . On Nov. 4 , 1952 , said President Eisenhower , U.S. voters crowded the polls to dictate a change in Government . What did they want ? <P> " Two years ago , " said Ike , " Americans wanted an end to the war in Korea-a war allowed to become futile , seemingly without end . . . Americans wanted a Government thrifty and frugal with the public 's money . They wanted a stop to the endless rise in taxes , taking more and more of the family income to support an overgrown Washington bureaucracy . They wanted something done about inflation-to end the growing discouragement , as , day by day , pensions and savings and the weekly paycheck bought less and less at the corner store . Americans were determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in our whole society . They did not consider it a red herring . " <P> On the 1952 world scene , the President recalled , war raged in Indo-China as well as in Korea . Iran , with 60% of the world 's known petroleum reserves , lay in deadly danger . Suez and Trieste were constant threats to peace . Even in the Americas , Communists were ready to take over Guatemala . All these were problems handed over to the Republican Administration . <P> The Present . How well have the Republicans met the challenge ? Ike proudly ticked off some answers : <P> Government costs have been cut by $11 billion and taxes by $7.4 billion-the " largest tax reduction in history . " The U.S. has been given " the strongest armed forces in our peacetime history " for less money . The Government has stopped roasting coffee , baking bread and making paint . It has stopped running a hotel . It has stopped running a tug and barge business on the inland waterways . It " has been returning to private citizens activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
