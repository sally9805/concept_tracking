IN San Francisco 's I. Magnin &; Co. shoppers can buy , for $500 , an 8-ft. cloth-covered , motorized kangaroo that pops a 3-ft. kangaroo out of its pouch . But they had better hurry , because the store sold out its supply once and had to scour Europe for more . In Beverly Hills a thoughtful fellow sent a birthday present to a department-store executive " who has everything " : a brush specially designed to clean the lint from his navel . R. H. Macy , Manhattan 's mass department store , offers French beaded purses for $99.50 ; Sears , Roebuck , the farmer 's friend , catalogues a $3,210 diamond ring for the farmer 's wife , a $718 electric golf cart for the farmer . Last week , at the Summer Gift Show in Chicago 's Merchandise Mart , prices were up as much as 100% over five years ago , but the show had the most successful run in its history , with sales 50% ahead of last year . One puzzled firm reported selling 200 Egyptian camel saddles at $100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Said Ted Russell of the gift firm of N. S. Gustin : " I 'm flabbergasted . The whole trend is amazing . " <P> In 1956 a great and growing number of Americans are willing and able to buy products considered luxuries ( or unheard of ) by their fathers , and even by themselves a generation ago . Says Lever Bros . Chairman Jervis Babb : " The great mass of American families have graduated from a people who work for a living to a people who work for luxury . Price is no longer a basic standard . People buy for value . The store 's problem is not to get rid of steaks , but to move the hamburger . " <P> <P> Statistically , the explanation is simple . Americans are making more money , have more to spend . Disposable income ( after taxes ) stood at $270.6 billion last year v. $206.1 billion for 1950 , $150.4 billion for 1945 . And since 1940 , U.S. discretionary income-the amount remaining from disposable income after subtracting food , clothing , housing , other necessities-has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater feeling of security about the future induced by continued prosperity ; they feel free to spend . They have more time to buy and to enjoy-roughly 1,200 more leisure hours annually than their grandparents had . Their tastes have been upgraded to an appreciation of quality . <P> The gold-plated and mink-trimmed whatnots are only the smallest part of the luxury market . To U.S. economists , the amazing fact about the new luxury market is the broadening and democratization of both the market and the luxuries themselves . Gone are the days when luxury meant a private railroad car , a steam yacht , a Newport chteau . From an emphasis on the ostentatious things that go with ceremony , luxury has focused on the convenient gadgets that make life easy for the many .
