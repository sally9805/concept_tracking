In Salzburg , Austria , a sickly , frightened Hungarian girl named Ilonka Nagy , 18 , told her story : <P> " The government employment office sent me to the Komlo coal mine , in Barany county near the Yugoslav border . There were about 300 girls and boys in the mine between 14 and 21 . When I went down in the shaft the first time , I was not afraid , but I looked around and said to myself : ' What kind of work is this-this is not for a girl . ' <P> " It was terribly hot , and we worked half-naked beside the men . The girls did all kinds of work like drilling and loading . Another girl and I worked with two men pushing cars on a 25-yard slip to the dump . In eight hours we pushed around 900 cars . We lived in a house near the mine , six girls to a room . The men could n't come to our house but the girls could go to the men 's dormitory . <P> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night with them . They gave them the best jobs , or reported they had loaded twelve cars to meet their work norm , when they loaded only ten . There was no regular hospital at the mine , but they had a twelve-bed lying-in hospital for the pregnant girls . The girls kept the children in the house till they were about five . After that , the children were put in the state school . It was a big thing to have a baby . They told us it was a work for peace . When the Imperialists killed a Hungarian in the next war , one of our children would be there to take his place . <P> " There were no Sunday or church holidays , only the Communist holidays , and we worked so hard to make these up that we were happier when they did n't come . To get a free day we had to work two shifts in a row , or 16 hours . About the only way to get out of work was to break an arm or leg . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 60 cases in six months . <P> " When we decided to escape , nine of us were finally in the party . At the frontier , my sister led , cutting the barbed wire and pointing : ' There is a mine , and there-go between them . ' I want to go to Australia . I hope the women there will not be treated like me . I would rather be hung than work in the mines again . "
