To U.S. commuters everywhere , the Long Island Rail Road has long stood out as the archetype of badly run roads , with topsy-turvy schedules , sooty cars and rough roadbeds . Last week the Long Island added what would once have been two more black marks to its long list of troubles . In the space of three days , two power failures during peak rush hours stranded 112 trains and kept 95,000 commuters waiting up to two hours . But this time , instead of rising up in wrath , most of the passengers took the delays with good grace . On each seat next morning , the Long Island placed a polite note explaining what had happened and what the road had done to repair the damage as fast as possible . Read the note : " Thank you for helping us in a bad situation . " <P> The notes were the latest proof of a new deal for the Long Island 's commuters . Under a twelve-year rehabilitation program started by the Long Island Transit Authority , the ugly duckling is sprouting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transit Authority and the Long Island 's bankruptcy trustee , William Wyer , pushed through a needed 20% average-fare increase , then got a 50% tax forgiveness from state and local governments . This year , out of bankruptcy and back in the hands of its parent Pennsylvania Railroad , the Long Island is beginning a $60 million modernization program . Furthermore , under General Manager Thomas Goodfellow , the road set up its first public-relations department to tell commuters how things are going , listen to their complaints . <P> As it is , oldtimers would hardly recognize the road . The Long Island has ordered 222 air-conditioned coaches worth $24 million , already put 30 in service ; another 95 cars have been completely rehabilitated ; 605 more are scheduled for overhauling . Some 56 stations have been repaired and painted , roadbeds improved , car repair shops modernized for more efficient operation . Better yet , commuters are beginning to get on-time service , and the road has added 60 trains for shoppers and midafternoon travelers . <P> By last week , both the financial and equipment improvements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long Island proudly reported that after years of red ink it showed a solid $731,710 net income for the nine months since September 1954 . Parent Pennsylvania , owner of the Long Island Rail Road stock , will take no profit , instead will plow it all back into the modernization program . <P> Across Long Island Sound in Connecticut , President Patrick McGinnis of the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Rail Road got no bouquets from commuters : <P> An irate group of Fairfield County , Conn. commuters led by Manhattan Executive John Orr Young ( cofounder of Young &; Rubicam advertising agency ) announced a plan for New Haven riders to buy one or two $36 shares of New Haven stock apiece , then pool their shares at the next annual meeting with the idea of challenging McGinnis as president .
