Senators enjoy barking at witnesses much as mastiffs enjoy barking at treed cats . But when Mrs. Olga Konow of Forest Hills , N.Y . took the stand in the Senate 's tanker investigation last week , the committee fell instantly into a state of trancelike gallantry . Improbable as it seemed , Mrs. Konow had arranged for the enormously profitable sale of three surplus tankers to United Tanker Corp. -a Chinese firm with a phony U.S. front , which subsequently delivered oil to the Chinese Reds . The Senators loved her . <P> It was not so much Mrs. Konow 's looks - although she cut a striking figure with her prematurely grey hair , her creamy complexion , coquettish eye and dashing figure . It was that Mrs. Konow thought the Senators were wonderful ; she had spent hours the day before hanging on their every word as they growled at witnesses , and had giggled in delight at their every witticism . When she was sworn in she giggled again and said in happy Slavic accents : " I am having lately a nickname . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of My Worries . " Frock-coated Chairman Clyde Hoey responded gallantly : one of the committee ( Wisconsin 's Joe McCarthy ) had expressed the hope that she would state her telephone number as well as address . Oilboat Olga smiled as though North Carolina 's Hoey had given her the Hope Diamond to use as a paperweight . She answered all the committee 's , questions . She was born in a part of Austria-Hungary which is now Czechoslovakia , came to the U.S. in 1939 . She was married to a wealthy , Norwegian-born shipping man named Magnus Konow . In 1947 , out of sheer vivacity and a desire to prove that she was not just a " sweet child , " she had bought two ships herself and had , in her own words , become the world 's only lady tanker operator . <P> Far from seeming apologetic about the tanker deal with the Chinese , Olga said simply : " I was very fortunate , because in the tanker business it is usually good to have a buyer . Tankers you always have . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships , that former Massachusetts Congressman Joe Casey &; Co. had three ships and that he was having trouble financing them . Olga brought both sides together . Had she investigated the people with whom she was dealing ? <P> " I just , after I met , or in between , or in before , whenever I met Mr. Wei , or Mr. Du or Dr. Chen , or whatever the name of these distinguished Chinese gentlemen are , it was none of my worries to worry about them , " she said discerningly . She was only interested , she said , in getting $100,000 as a commission on the sale of each of the three ships . Eventually she threw her own two tankers into the pot , too , and wound up with only $450,000 , but was satisfied . <P> The Main Thing . What kind of a deal did the buyers &; sellers make ? " I was n't interested in what happened , " she said . " I had done my excellent work and I was waiting to receive my moneys . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The main thing was that it was coming . " <P> When the questioning was over , Olga cried , joyously : " I want to thank you very much . It was the thrill of my life . " She kissed three startled reporters on the way out . It had , if the Senators ' expressions meant anything , been a wonderful , wonderful afternoon .
