100He made a gesture of repudiation and dismissal , then saw that she was smiling at him . " You fought for the right , " she said . " I do n't care about politics , " he burst out . " Just say I fought . " " Oh , I 'm not talking about politics , " she replied , shaking her head , and he thought he detected an added irony in her smile . " Not that , " she added . " Just the right . " " The right ? " " He  --  that man  --  he was weak and sickly . " " I fought on impulse , " Jeremiah said , " and I "  --  and he threw courtesyto the winds  --  " and I do not want to talk about it ! " Then he waited for her rebuke or her anger , bracing himself for it . But it did not come . What she said was : " Do not be angry with me , Mr. Beaumont . I beg you . And do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was about to speak , but she cut him off with a lifted hand . " You are very young , Mr. Beaumont , and the young feel that to appear older they must apologize for the right . And the old . . . " she paused and the sadness of the smile twisted to bitterness , " and the old , they have nothing to apologize for . " Then she turned from him . He observed how the strong freckled hands lay on her lap , and how the warmth of candlelight touched her face with a glow and ripeness and gave even the whiteness of the throat and breast the hint of gold , and " involved its own color in her rich hair . " He knew that the joy discovered that evening was given him on credit , but he took it and waited . He could afford to wait , in confidence , as a rich man waits untroubled by small debts unpaid . Meanwhile , day by day as the season wore on , he returned . In the bright windless afternoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mined roses , or in the evenings , in the first chill of autumn , in the library with lighted candles . Then the season broke . The heavy frost came , and the world was briefly brilliant . Then the rain set in steady , and all color was washed away . The rains continued , the sodden skies disintegrating into gray , slow rain hour after hour . And if the rain stopped , the air itself was so damp and raw that moisture stood out on cheek or leather or cloth . The earth was so sodden that firm turf quaked underfoot and squelched , and if you stood still you could hear the faint susurrus and hiss of water shifting its place in the spongy earth or being squeezed from the surface by your own motionless weight . At night when it was not raining you could still hear the sound of water dripping from eaves and from the boughs of trees . The streams ran swollen and streaked red and yellow with the earth being borne away , everyp 101gully and ditch was a bleeding wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , seemed to be losing itself in the vast , irremediable deliquescence . Human strength and human meaning seemed to flow away , too , to bleed away with the dissolving world . Night and day were not clearly marked . At noon you could not locate even the fainter spot in the pervasive gray to mark the point of the sun . The light of noon was a sad twilight fading away rapidly to dark . The light itself seemed to drip from the sky and be trodden underfoot and absorbed into the neutral heaviness of earth . Night came with a kind of relief , for the dark was absolute and betrayed no promises . In the early afternoons of that season Jeremiah Beaumont rode across that crepuscular world , to the plash of hoofs in mud or the roar or drip of water , wrapped in a special happiness . The loneliness of the world , the single sullen traveler on the road , who did not speak , the sodden horse standing motionless in a field with head down , the dripping , despairing , soundless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feather  --  all of that made more certain and precious the secret towardwhich he was riding . It made more inviolable the circle of glowing firelight in which he would soon sit . And once in the room , when he would be waiting for Rachel Jordan to come , the mystery of the house which he had not penetrated , the shadowy rooms beyond and above where he had never set foot and where things had happened which he would never know , emphasized the certainty of the bright hearth by which he stood . He had no curiosityabout the rest of the house . He preferred to let it belong to the realm of dampness and shadows . He was not even curious when he saw the face in the mirror . He had just been admitted by Old Josie and led to the library , and was standing on the hearth with his hands to the blaze , when he caught a slight movement in the mirror above the mantel . In the darkness of the reflected hall , to one side of the open door and well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he saw the face . When he saw it he did not start . His woodsman 's instinct forbade that , as though the surprise had come from a flicker of leaves or the crack of a twig . But he registered the mirrored image in the tail of his eye , calculated it , and never moved his hands from the blaze or lifted his head . It was a woman 's face , the face of an old woman . The skin hung slackly from it as though it had once been well fleshed but was now shrunk to the bone . The nose was sharpened by the skin sagging away to the sides , past the drawn mouth , to the empty dewlaps . The general color , as well as he could make out in the shadow , was yellowish , like old crusted dough , and the eyes were dark . The peering face , p 102hung back in the shadows as though belonging to no body but floatingmotionless in the medium of the shadows like something drowned , wore an expression of vindictiveness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Jordan , for he knew that she lived here though Rachel had never even mentioned her . Previouslyhe had thought it strange that he had not been presented to her , but he had assumed that grief or ill health made the mother a recluse . Covertly studying the face in the mirror , he relished the fact that it belonged to the dark house and unexplored rooms and all the twilit world stretching away forever , but not to this room and the bright hearth . Then at some sound in the house , the face was gone , and in a moment Rachel appeared at the door and moved toward him with a greeting on her lips . He said nothing to her of the face , neither then nor later . Nor did he speak to her of its subsequent appearances . The subsequent appearanceswere many . Almost every time he came to the house , he saw the face . As he stood in the hall , it would spy on him from the crack of a door or stare down at him from some region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bookcase , alone in the room , the face would be in the hall outside , suspended in its shadows . But he never gave a sign of recognition , and never turned his eyes to meet those eyes : It was a game , precious and obsessive , with cunning and awareness matched against cunning and awareness , a game played for ultimate stakes , like the game that had been played not long back in this land when it was a land of dark forests and beasts and savages , a game of hunter and hunted . But he could not know which he was , the hunter or the hunted , or both , and that ambiguity was , in a way , the source of his final pleasure . " I came to wait for the eyes upon me , and their secret peering , " he wrote , " and to know that they were like the eyes of the world which would pry from the shadow upon us in our deepestsolitude and before which we must act in our fear or pride . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay for supper . A real storm had blown up , with driving rain and wind . She had never asked him before , and he had always assumed that some situation in the mystery of the house forbade it . Now he thought , suddenly , that he would meet the mother . He would meet her across a table , across dishes and platters of ordinary food , by the light of ordinary candles , and they would say to each other the things of ordinary civility . His first impulse was one of abrupt refusal , refusal to have that face brought from its swimming shadows and presented to him , with an aging , commonplace body attached , in the common and meaningless light , to violate something that belonged preciously to him. p 103He did not , however , meet the face . Mrs. Jordan did not appear at the table for supper . " My mother is not well this evening , " Rachel said , and offered no further excuses or explanations , not even a perfunctorymessage of regret . And Jeremiah 's own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet Mrs. Jordan until much later , and meanwhile the game with the spying face was resumed . And meanwhile he resumed his happiness by the hearth in the library . But with a difference . He knew now that this was only a stage in his journey , a moment in his day , and that this casual joy had almost dulled his purpose and betrayed his deepest self . He had gained nothing . He was no closer to Rachel Jordan than before . When he had tried to speak to her of love , he had allowed her to shift her ground with innocent ease . When he had tried to make her state the impediment to love , he had not had the courage or brutality to force the issue in the face of , her anger or pain . All his little traps had been unavailing . As when , one afternoon , he remembered how she had said she knew of Percival Skrogg , and guessed that she knew of him through CassiusFort , who was a friend and admirer of Skrogg , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew of Skrogg . How did you know him ? " " Skrogg ? " she questioned , and by her voice he detected , or thought he detected , evasion or fear . " Yes , Percival Skrogg . How did you know of him ? " " I do n't remember , " she said , looking away from him into the fire . " Are you sure ? " " I 'm sure , " she said , and he was certain of the lie in her voice . He leaned at her , staring at her , trying to make her face him . " Listen , " he said , " when I mentioned his name the first time , you recognized it and spoke with confidence . How did you know ? " " Oh , what does it matter ? " He rose abruptly . " It matters a great deal , " he affirmed . " You must remember . " " I will not be catechized , " she said , still not looking at him . He noticed that the strong freckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moved , and then clenched , and that her fine waist swayed slightly . He noticed that , with a touch of triumphant cunning . " You must remember , " he said severely . " Would you call me a liar , Mr. Beaumont ? " she demanded . And she lifted her face to him , quite steadily but with an obvious effort , and he observed the brightness of her gold-flecked , brown eyes , as though tears were about to start . He did not have the heart to go on , to press his advantage . It was easier to sink back into his chair , and murmur , " Forgive me , " and float luxuriously in the depth of the moment and of her presence. p 104So all he had gained from the weeks in that room was a more intimateknowledge of her face and the movement of firelight upon it , of the lurking subtleties of brown and bronze and flame in her splendid hair , of the graceful thrust and sway of her waist , and of the strong articulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than any delicacy of modeling would have done . But that knowledge was the knowledge of distance . He had not set his lips to the brown spot on her cheek , " where warmth of firelight seemed to gather . " He had not passed a strand of her hair through his fingers or released its mass to fall about her face and his own . He had not encircled the " clean span of her waist . " He had not even held her hands in his own , or felt the strong fingers clutch his shoulders to draw him to her . That , however , was not what he sought . That might come , and he thought much of the time when it would come . He thought too much of that time when it might come , for thinking of that made him forget that that could come and come without meaning . If it came , it must come upon his own terms . Otherwise the hottest breath and most abandoned sigh and most profound latching of members that might take place on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the bestial horror and sweaty simper of Silly Sal . Then waiting alone in the library one evening when he had been invited to supper , he looked suddenly at the couch and saw as before his very eyes the abomination that he knew must have been there before , in this very room , by firelight or by the last winking coals at night , before this hearth , in this spot . He sprang from his chair and found himself standing before the couch with his eyes fixed upon it . A groan of agony and rage burst from him , and he lifted his arms as though to strike and kill whatever was before him . If Rachel Jordan had entered at that moment he might have leaped at her and struck her down  --  he might at least have done that much  --  and have rushed out into the dark storm . But she did not come . And there was nothing under his gaze , nothing at all but the empty couch , and nothing in him but a kind of nausea " like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraws from the valley . " There was no enemy to strike down . At least , not here . And then he had a strange thought . " There came to me , upon the instant , a fancy which made me see the paradox and doubleness of life . I would have held as enemy and struck down the man who was a betrayer and whose shadow seemed to perform the very act before my jealous and stricken eyes . But was he my enemy ? For the very act that made him my enemy had brought me to that room and into the presence of her whom I knew as all my good . For had Rachel Jordan not been p 105betrayed I had never known her . Should I not kiss his hand in gratitude ? I stood puzzling that conceit , but suddenly I saw that though it held a truth , the truth itself was but another trap to snare my foot and hold me back from the way I was set upon . As that thought struck me , a servant entered to summon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that thought , and sat almost wordless through the meal , while he ate the food that had no taste for him and rarely lifted his eyes to Rachel Jordan across the candlelight . He would drive on his way . He would make her speak . The inspiration came as they went back to the library after supper . She had gone to the hearth and taken her accustomed seat . He stopped by the bookcase and laid his hand on a book . " May I read to you ? " he asked . " There is something I would read to you . " " Yes , " she said . He drew out the book and held it in his hand . It was the blue book with the name Byron stamped in gold on it , the book Colonel Fort had given him long back . " As I held it in my hand , " he wrote , " I felt a great excitement and thought again , as I had thought that afternoon when I first found it there , how the book which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sent as the instrument to fulfill the lives of us all . I went to my seat bearing it preciously as though it might slip from my hands and break . " I took my seat and pretended to examine the book . It is a pretty book , ' I said , and looked up at her sharply . " Yes , ' she agreed indifferently , but I saw that her eyes were upon it . " I opened the book to find , as I knew I would find , the leaf torn out at the first and the pages loosened . Look , ' I said , look what somebodyhas done . They have ruined the book . ' " Yes , I know , ' she said in her indifference . " Who could have done it ? ' I demanded . " Oh , I do n't know . One of the servants . ' " Do servants read books ? ' I asked . " Oh , I do n't know . But it 's done . Is n't that enough ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' " She looked quickly at me , and in some agitation : What  --  what do you mean ? ' " Nothing , ' I replied . Then I held the book out for her to see , and added : Look , look how it is torn out . Look . ' " She did not look , averting her gaze from me to the fire . I am not interested , ' she said . " But look  --  how violently . What could make you tear . . . ? ' " But I did n't ! ' she cried , and again turned away , as to dismiss the matter. p 106 " I regarded her for a moment , and felt sorry for the lies she had told me then and all the times before , for she was the soul of truth , but truth caught in the pain of the world to feel forced to lie and in the lie to compound the pain . But I knew , too , that there was only one salve for that pain . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compel her with my gaze , and demanded : Why would one tear it out ? ' " Oh , I do n't want to talk , ' she said . You said you wanted to read to me . ' " So I turned to the place where a little poem says : I speak not , I trace not , I breathe not thy name , There is grief in the sound , there is guilt in the fame : But the tear which now burns on my cheek may impart The deep thoughts that dwell in that silence of heart . Too brief for our passion , too long for our peace , Were those hours  --  can their joy or their bitterness cease ? We repent , we abjure , we will break from . . . " And at that , she rose suddenly from her chair , leaned at me , and said harshly : Give me that book ! ' " Before I could answer , she had snatched it from me . She straightened up , bent the book wide open so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boards and some pages in each hand , at the top of the book . I saw how tight was her grip and how the strong knuckles went white and on the whiteness the freckles started out . Then with the strength of her pain or fury she tore it across , with some leaves falling loose to the hearth . Then she flung it into the fire , and the flames leaped up to take it . " Then she put a hand to her brow , pushing back the heavy hair , and stared at the new combustion . " Why did you do it ? ' I demanded . " She wheeled suddenly at me , and made a wild gesture with the hand that had been at her brow , and tossed her head so that some locks came loose on one cheek almost to the shoulder . Oh , I am sick , I am sick of it ! ' " Sick of what ? ' " Everything  --  everything ! ' she replied and tossed her head . " Everything ? ' " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " I hate the book , I hate it ! ' " So you tore out the leaf ! ' " I hate it , ' she said , that 's why ! ' And she flung her arm wide and looked suddenly about and swayed in the light of the fire which was p 107still bright from the burning book . That 's why , ' she repeated . I hate it . And I hate  --  I hate . . " I rose to my feet and stood before her . Hate who ? ' I demanded , and my breath came sharp with expectation . " She returned her gaze to me , and it was not wild and distracted as before , but steady and searching and cold as though she had just seen me for the first time . " Hate who ? ' I asked , again . " You , ' she said , in a voice like a whisper , and looked into my face , you ! ' " Me ? ' I asked , but without surprise , for suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . " You , ' she whispered again , with intensity . " Listen , ' I said to her . Listen to me . ' I took a step toward her and looked down into her face . Shall I tell you why you hate me ? ' " She did not answer , and her lips seemed to grow white and stiff , and her face drawn with fear . " Shall I tell you ? ' I asked as quietly as might be , and leaned as though to confide a secret . " Her lips worked without uttering a sound , and then she struck me , on the chest , with both hands , very hard , so hard I was astonished at the force from a woman who was sweetly made . She struck again and again . I stood under the blows , and felt a joy in them , and my heart was big and solid in my chest to strangle breath . " The blows stopped . Her hands dropped to her side , and her body sagged and swayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not put forth a hand to stay her , for even if she should fall now , on the hearth before the fire , I knew that I must not touch her . If she fell , and lay there , I must not lean to draw her up . " But she did not fall . She swayed , and then braced herself with a hand to the mantel shelf . She was not looking at me now . She looked down at the curled and blackened leaves of the book amid the flames now gone small . Go away , ' she said dully . Please go away . Go away , for I hate you . ' " At that I leaned and took the free hand that hung at her side , and kissed it once , but with no considerable pressure of the lips . Then I went from the room . " Jeremiah left the room , into the dark side hall , where he fumbled for his surtout and hat , then into the main hall , which was lighted by one big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside door , he heard a rustle in the dark side hall . He paused with his hand on the knob , and his awareness of the sound mixed with the elation he felt at the scene just passed. p 108It was the old woman . She had been spying all the time . He felt no anger at the thought . It was right that she should spy from the dark hall upon them . It was right that as you played the game of love and your dearest hope by the bright hearth , you should play another game with the face of age and envy and hate that stared at you from the shadows . It was the old woman who , at last , brought an end to that game , and transferred the conflict to another plane . She accomplished it , though presumably it was not what she had intended to accomplish . She accomplished it some ten days after Jeremiah 's quarrel with Rachel . During that period , Jeremiah felt no more the temptation to relax into the " sweet hearthside peace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their unexpected strength on his chest he had won a victory . " I knew  --  or rather my heart knew when it grew big in my bosom to strangle breath at the moment of her blows  --  that I had breached a frontier . I had entered into the territory she would protect , and her violence was the mark of my victory . She was like one who seated in a strong citadel might have defended it forever against assault until the enemy spent his force and withered in the field about , but who had been stung to sally forth without reason from the rampartsand accept unequal battle in the open country . " She retired again , bested and bruised , within that citadel , but she could not man it as strongly now . Her greatest casualty was her judgment , and Jeremiah knew that . Having once been tempted forth , she would succumb more readily to the next provocation , to exposed violence , or if she did not succumb at once she would suffer by the inner struggle to suppress the impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now her secret weakness , and knew that I must press hard . But in my joy at the thought of victory was a kind of sadness at the necessary way , for I could not say to her that I would conquer her country only to love in the end its queen more dearly , as Theseus took the Amazon Hippolyta , and that I would expiate all ravage by becomingnot her master but her most devoted slave . " So he returned to her and pressed hard his advantage . We do not have the details of those days , for Jeremiah 's record is summary . We do know , however , that more than once she was reduced to tears , that once she swore that she would fling herself into the river rather than live longer in a world where all was against her and she could not find a true friend , and that once in a fury she ordered him from the house not to return . He immediately rose , told her that he took his leave forever , and went away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would summon him . After four days of absence , the note was brought him by one of the Jordan field hands to the Barron house . It said for p 109him to come if he could forgive her hasty words which had been spoken in pain of spirit and could come but as a friend and in mercy . For she needed friendship and mercy . He came , and there he saw , for the first time face to face , the old woman . He had been admitted into the main hall of the house and been asked by Josie to go into the library while she told Miss Rachel he had come . While Josie went upstairs , he went into the little side hall . Just as he was about to enter the open door of the library , he sensed the presence near him , and slowly turned his head . She stood just beyond the open door itself , not behind it but beyond it in its shadow . She was , it seemed , making no effort at concealment now , for she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to enter the library . She was a rather small woman wearing a black dress  --  he was aware of that , and of the fact that she was smaller than he had thought , but his gaze fixed on her face . Ah , he knew that face well already , he seemed to have known it forever , he seemed to have met it peering from all the dark corners and secret angles and shadowed doorways of his life . He knew the yellow , drawn face , with the flesh sagging away from the sharpened nose , and he knew the black eyes that glittered at him from the muddy whites in which they floated . He recognized , with the comfort of familiarity , the fear and hate and the terrible curiosity , worse than fear or hate , that the face , wore . She moved a little toward him , seeming to sway toward him withoutvolition or effort as though sustained in the medium of her shadows and borne that little distance by some sluggish shift in their fluidity . She was still again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go away . " " Are you Mrs. Jordan ? " he asked . " No , " she said , " no . And go away . " " Who are you ? " " I am Maria Hopeby , and they  --  and Timothy Jordan , Timothy Jordan  --  he brought me here , away from home , away from Virginia  --  I was a sweet young girl in Virginia  --  but they brought me here , to this place  --  and oh , and oh , what they did to me ! " " You are Rachel 's mother , " he said slowly , examining her . " And oh , what they did to me , " she wailed , more desolate and hideous than before . " You are Rachel 's mother , " he repeated in his certainty . " No , " she said , " no  --  oh , I 'm not her mother  --  if I were her mother she would n't treat me this way , she would n't do what she did  --  for she did it  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for she . . . " I can not go , " he said , more to himself than to her , " I can not go , because I love your daughter . " p 110 " Love  --  love ? " she whispered , with what he took to be a shudder of horror . " Love  --  oh , you ca n't love her , nobody can love her , nobody could  --  for I 'll tell you what she did . . . " She leaned at him , as though the sustaining fluid of shadow had shifted again , and clutched the sleeve of his coat . " I 'll tell you , " she whispered , enraptured in confidence . " It was a terrible thing  --  and she did it to spite me , she did it to ruin me  --  oh , I never did her any harm , but she did a terrible thing , and I 'll tell you . . . " " No , " the voice said calmly , and the old woman gave a gasp and stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just inside the library . " No , " Rachel repeated , " she wo n't tell you , Mr. Beaumont . She wo n't tell you . For I will tell you myself . " She took a step toward them , and the old woman 's hand , which still clutched his sleeve , releasedits hold and the old woman drew back , with her eyes still fixed on Rachel 's face . " But first , " Rachel said , " I must apologize for my spying . Or should I apologize ? I have been spied on so long , I have earned the right to spy for once . Though I had not intended to spy . I was simply waiting here in this room and did not declare myself . Perhaps I have been corrupted , too . But I have not waited in corners . I have not stood behind doors in the dark to hear what I should not hear  --  to see things , things nobody should ever see  --  to see things people did in the dark . I never spied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ... " She took a step forward , toward the old woman , and suddenly pointed at her . " . . . like you ! " The old woman retreated , then stopped , and tears began to spill down her cheeks . " Nobody loves me , " she said , almost like a whisper to herself . " Nobody loves me . A long time ago  --  in Virginia  --  people loved me . They love me in Virginia  --  but here  --  but here . . . " Rachel turned to Jeremiah . " Mr. Beaumont , " she said in a level voice , " please feel free to go . To go and not come back . It was my mother 's advice , and it is mine . " " No , " he said , and shook his head . " In that case , come with me and I will tell you what my mother calls the terrible thing and would have told you . Then you can go if you like . " Without waiting for an answer she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother as though they were posts to a gate , and moved down the side hall and into the main hall , toward the big door . He followed her . " Wait , " he said . With her hand on the latch , she turned . " It is cold out , " he said . " Very cold . You will need a cloak . " p 111 " I need nothing , " she replied , and opened the door and went out . He seized his own coat and followed . By the time he was on the portico she was beyond the drive , on the lawn , moving toward the garden . She was walking quite fast , and he did not overtake her until she had reached the gate to the garden . There , he flung the coat about her shoulders . She did not turn , but continued on the garden path . She held the center , and gave no indication that she wished him to walk beside her . So he let her lead the way to wherever she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a stile on the low wall beyond . Then there was a kind of lane beside a corn field , with a hedge on one side and the bare field on the other . The stubble stretched away there toward the woods and the river . Overhead the sky was a cold gray with a heatless , hazy sun already westering . The earth of the lane bore a frozen crust , but a crust so thin that at each step it broke into the stiff mud below . Jeremiah noticed that the hem of the skirt just ahead of him was already fouled , and when now and then the skirt flickering with her step showed a heel , he saw that the light shoe designed for carpet or floor was stained and mired like a clod-hopper 's brogan . They came to the end of the hedge , took another stile over a stone wall , and crossed a meadow , where the dead grass was crisp with frost beneath the foot . The meadow sloped gently upward to an open grove on the farther side , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They approached the grove , in the same order , Jeremiah a pace or two behind , and passed within it . He saw the graves , the small one near at hand , the other beyond , some twenty feet away . She knelt by the small grave , and passed her hand across the stone at its head . " Look , " she commanded . " Read it . " He leaned to read it : MY SONBorn dead to my sorrowBut to his own happinessIn that he never saw the world . May 7 , 1821She looked up at him . " Oh , if he had lived ! " she exclaimed . " If he had lived , then I might have lived . There might have been something to live for . " He ignored her words . " Is this  --  it ? " he demanded . " Yes ! " she burst out at him , " and you knew it  --  you knew it all the time . " He nodded soberly . " But not from your lips , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , you were cruel , " she cried in accusation , " all those weeks to try to make me say it -- say it  --  when you knew . " " I had to know from your lips . " " You were cruel , " she said dully , not looking up at him , the accusationdraining away . " Look , " he commanded , and when she lifted her head , he pointed at the stone . " Was I as cruel as  --  as that  --  villain ? " " Villain ? " she asked , " villain ? " and awkwardly kneeling there on the dead beech leaves , she made a wide gesture of despair . " Yes , villain , " Jeremiah asserted . " Oh , he was no villain , he was no villain . It was just  --  it was just . . . " She lifted a hand to her brow , palm outward , and looked beyond Jeremiah and around over the emptiness of the meadow and the sky to find her answer . " It was just  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To me . Something that happened to me . It was nobody 's fault , it was . . . " " Fault ? " he demanded. . . nobody 's fault , and if he had lived , if he had been in my arms  --  if he had been little and sweet in my arms , then everything  --  then everything . . . " He took a step toward her . " Was it Fort ? " he demanded . " But he died , " she said . " He was dead  --  he was dead in me  --  and I never had him ... " " Was it Fort ? " She looked up at him as though hearing the question for the first time . " What does it matter ? " she asked , and sank back upon herself , proppingherself with one hand to the ground . " Was it Fort ? " She nodded , not looking up . " Yes , " she said . " The villain ! " he exclaimed . " I told you  --  I told you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He leaned above , not touching her . " Was that the impediment ? " She nodded . " Do you love him ? " " How do I know ? " she demanded . " It was so long ago , and so strange . " " I love you , " he said , very earnestly . " Stop it , stop it , " she begged , and lifted her hands as though to ward off a blow . " I will teach you what love is , " he declared , and leaned and took her by each shoulder , looking into her face . She jerked away , and scrambled to her feet . " It is too late  --  too late ! " she cried. p 113He pointed at the grave . " Because of that ? " he asked . And before she could answer , he added : " If you mean that , I should say that but for your pain I would call it blessed . For it is what first brought me to you . " Then he took her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his embrace , letting her head with its loosening hair fall back to one side , and uttering a moan like distress as she took his kiss . He was surprised , even in the joy of his victory , at the reality of her person , at the slack substance and dead weight which seemed about to slip from him to the frozen ground . He experiencedan irrational terror , and clutched her strongly to him like a wrestler , so strongly that she gasped in pain and he felt upon his lips the exhalation that the pressure of his grip had forced from her body . Then she returned his kiss . But all at once she was struggling against him , averting her face and shoving with her hands and wrenching her body . In his astonishment , he let her slip from him . " No  --  no ! " she said wildly . " It is too late  --  too late now . Oh , if you had come early , if you had come long ago , long back before they ruined the world  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world  --  if you had come then  --  but they ruined it , they ruined me  --  and that is all "  --  she flung out an arm toward the grave  --  " that is all they gave me  --  all he gave me  --  dead  --  it was dead ... " " Listen ! " he commanded , " listen to me . " He seized her right hand and held it firmly , though she pulled against him . " Listen , " he said , " for I love you ! " " Love , " she said bitterly , " how should I know what love is ? " " I know what it is , " he declared . " It is that for which a man would do anything . And I  --  " " Too late  --  too late ! " she said . " For all the world is ruined . " He gripped her hand more strongly , and leaned at her , speaking rapidly and in a low voice . " One world is ruined , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? And to make another we must throw the first away . We must pluck it out and throw it away . We must crush it . Destroy it . Do you hear ? " He leaned closer , staring into her eyes . " For there must be justice . You have suffered enough and there must be justice . And when there is justice you will not suffer , and I will do anything ... " Rachel jerked back , crying , " Oh , why do you torture me ? " " I do not torture you , " Jeremiah said gravely , " for I would bring you peace . Where there is justice there is peace , and I will do anything . Do you hear ? " " What would you drive me to ? " " To peace , " he said , and leaned again , his voice almost a whisper . " For when the past is destroyed , when it is plucked out ... " p 114 " No  --  no ! " And she tugged to be loosed from him. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , what do you want of me ? " she cried , and tossed her head as in agony . " To be my wife , " he said quietly . She stared at him , saying nothing . " For I would redeem all . " " She continued to stare at him , slowly , from her distance . " Will you ? " he asked . She wet her lips . Then , in the middle of the great silence of the frozen land , in a scarcely audible whisper , she said , " Yes . " " Yes ? " " Yes  --  if ... " " If what ? " he demanded , and gripped her hand more strongly . But she was not looking at him . She flung a wide gaze beyond him and the grave and the beech trees and the meadows and frozen fields and sky . " If what ? " he insisted . " All right , all right ! " she cried in a voice that rang suddenly wild and free . " All right ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . His heart stopped , big in his breast . Her hand , when he put his lips to it , was cold as ice . p 115SHE HAD SAID IT . AND IN THE ASTONISHmentof the moment his heart stood still . Astonishment is the word he uses . " What she said struck me like the clap of thunder and the flash of lightning when the bolt rips the summer tree before your face and unravels all its green , and your blood freezes on the stroke with what is neither terror nor joy , but both fused in a recognition of magnificence . It is not surprise . For the true astonishment does but reveal what you had known most deeply beyond all the words and common works of life . It reveals what the midnight pulse would say , had we but ears . " So she had said it , and had laid on him the obligation . Or we may say more accurately that he had at last succeeded in laying the obligation on her and thereby on himself , for the obligation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " midnight pulse . " But the promptings of the midnight pulse must find their shape in the world , must find the word and the deed , for otherwise they are nothing . Jeremiah Beaumont had to create his world or be the victim of a world he did not create . Out of his emptiness , which he could not satisfy with any fullness of the world , he had to bring forth whatever fullness might be his . And in the end must not every man , even the most committed and adjusted worldling , do the same ? If he is to live past the first gilded promise of youth and the first flush of appetite ? p 116 " I shall try to be worthy , " Jeremiah murmured as he released Rachel 's hand , and then she turned away  --  for she turned and made no answer  --  arid he followed her down the lane toward the house , staring at the crunched tracks her feet left in the frozen mud , and wondering in humility if he could be worthy . Not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could take his chance on that , and if the lead found him , he would die in the idea of justice . But was he worthy to die for that idea ? Wherein lay worthiness ? " I trembled that I was too poor a pot to carry the golden elixir of justice . " Then , staring at the frozen mud , he thought how the world would find him worthy and would applaud his deed : " I had previously considered the case in private justification , but now it came to me that the verdict of all men of honor would favor my enterprise . For how could a man clasp a wife to his bosom when one who had wronged her still breathed the same air ? " At the first instant that thought seemed to justify him in his new course , but then he saw that it was an index of his own unworthiness . It was an appeal to the world , and he had repudiated the world when he turned his back on Bowling Green and its fair prospects . No , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the act had such a motive , it would be but an act of the world . Any man , however vile , would strike to defend a wronged wife . That was an " interested act " such as the world could understand and applaud . But Jeremiah sought the act " uninterested and pure , " and apart from the world 's judgment . He would take the wronged woman to wife only after he had defended her , not defend her because she was already , and by the accident of things , his wife . The gratuitous act : that was what he sought . But why did he seek it , the act outside the motives of the world ? The answer is easy . It was the only way he knew to define himself , to create his world . We look back on his story , so confused and comic and pretentious and sad , and it seems very strange to us , for our every effort is to live in the world , to accept its explanations , to do nothing gratuitously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain explanations , and the self is gratuitous in the end . So Jeremiah discarded the justification of the world and proceeded down the lane and over the garden stile and through the rged garden . Near the house , Rachel turned . " Do not come with me , ' she requested . Jeremiah did not answer , but nodded in acquiescence . He leaned to take her hand , but she withdrew from him , suddenly and abruptly as though his touch might bruise or stain . His face must have shown his surprise , for she said , " Forgive me . I would not wound your feelings . But  --  but not now . Not now . " " Not even your hand ? " he questioned . " Not even my hand , " she said . p 117 " I am your servant , " he said . And added : " In the little as in the great . " She nodded , with the air of a person who is abstracted and can manage only the faintest courtesy . " I shall not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and turned away and walked toward the stables . There was nobody at the stables , so he saddled the horse himself , and took the lane that led around the yard of the house to join the approach just outside the stone gateposts of the main entrance . There he looked back . Rachel was still standing where he had left her , on the winter lawn , looking not at him but across the fields , wrapped in her meditation . As he rode away , he realized , he says , that she was right . She had been right to make him go , and go immediately . " For I saw late what she wisely knew from the first , that our true union now lay in our great Purpose . Further conversation or endearments such as lovers commonly use would but distract us , and even the touch of my lips to her hand , which she had denied on parting , would stain the moment of our resolve and make what we hoped to be no better than any bumpkin Jack and Jill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Our great Purpose , he called it then , and in subsequent pages of his narrative that phrase , or the word Purpose , always capitalized , reappears whenever he speaks of the contemplated act . The real contentof the act is almost forgotten , evaporated in the phrase , the word , the idea . What would be the real content of the act ? Two men stand up and face each other at a few paces  --  one a young man in what the letter of the courtroom spectator was to call " the green and gristle of his age , " the other a strong man in the strength of his years , the young man ardent , talented , deeply indebted to the other , the other full of fatherly attachment and ripe experience . They stand at dawn in a glade or clearing , behind them the remainingmass of a dark forest which had once covered the great central valley of a wild continent , before them a muddy track and a corn field ruined by winter , the mark of man 's as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds and the surgeon , a frontier doctor with some wads of lint , a bottle of whisky , and a pair of forceps in a saddlebag  --  wait with the air of farmers outside a country church waiting for the service to begin . They all wear black coats and their boots are stained with winter mud . A horse tethered under the trees snorts , farts and stamps . At the count , two pistols pop and release their puffs of smoke on the frosty air . One man falls , twitches on the ground , bleeds and gasps . This happens because one of the two men , the older , had done something perfectly natural . He had p 118been in a lonely house with a handsome , young , neurotic , desperate woman , had brought her sympathy , and had , finally , tupped her in a dark parlor . At the time the young woman was not even known to the younger man . Hecuba had been nothing to him and he nothing to Hecuba . So one of the men dies on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given circumstances the heart stops beating . Then the chemistry in that certain mass of flesh alters . Underground in the dark , the hair and nails and beard grow a little longer . Then that growth stops , and the disintegrating chemistry proceeds according to its natural law . That death , which we regard as perfectly silly and unnecessary , is the most real content of the event . Some of our forefathersregarded it as silly and unnecessary . In the 1820 's , a Frankfortnewspaper comments on a certain duel : " Yesterday morning two dunces stood up and exchanged shots from pistols . One was hit and died . It is a pity that the other dunce did not meet a like fate . We can dispense with a few more such dunces . " We are complacent as we look back on those dunces , and we congratulate the newspaper editor in old Frankfort for being so much like ourselves . But , on second thought , we may be like the dunces . We do not stand up at dawn , but we lie in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rain and wait for the steel pellet whipping through the fronds . We go down in the deep sea in a steel casket full of mechanisms like a watch , and wait for the shudder of the depth charge . At five thousand feet in the air we ride a snarling motor into the veil of flak . For Hecuba may be something to us , after all . For who is Hecuba , who is she , that all the swains adore her ? She is whatever we must adore . Or if we adore nothing , she is what we must act as if we adored . And if we adore her , we must do so , not because we know her , but because we do not know her . If before we go out on our great design we lean to kiss her hand , she will always withdraw it and we must ride away to leave her brooding on a winter lawn . Or to regard the matter in a different light , we can never leave Hecuba . She is what we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She is our folly and our glory and despair . And if we do not adore her , we can adore nothing or only Silly Sal , who was found tasty in Bowling Green by the hot boys of the town . The night of his return to the Barron house , after he had left Rachel Jordan alone on the lawn , Jeremiah went to bed early and slept like a baby . It was a deep , dreamless sleep , the kind of sleep a man sleeps " when after long traveling and bad ways he comes home and lies down in his own bed . " When he woke up the next morning , the late winter dawn was just coming through his window , and p 119though it was after his usual hour of rising he gave himself the privilege of lying there , wide awake and feeling the course of vigor in his limbs , to relish the new peace which he had found . The recollection of his new obligation merely confirmed the peace , and what he had to do and all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this peace , " as when you sit in a quiet room and look through the glass of a window upon the activity of men beyond in the sunlight and know what they do and see their gestures and the movement of their lips , but hear no sound . " He knew that he would soon go out into that world of action and himself speak words and lift his arm , but he would still remain detachedfrom the self that went out , in the " quiet room " looking out through the glass of the window . For the quiet room might be the reality , and the sunlit hurlyburly outside nothing but the dream . " For it came to me that morning , " he writes , " that only if you look out upon your own act as from a window does your act become real to you and take meaning in the world . " But he knew that he had to act , and looked forward to the action as the fulfillment of his peace . His first act was to write a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear Wilkie : Since I hold you as my dear friend , I address myself to you for a service . I find myself in a situation which before many days have passed will almost certainly provoke a challenge . I regard this fact with equanimity , indeed with keen complacence , and trust that I am beyond regret for its cause . I also trust that from the affection you bear me and from your kind confidence in my scruple of honor you will see fit to second me upon the occasion . I should of course be deeply indebted , whatever the event . And whatever your decision , be assured that I remain your friend andYour obedient servant , Jerry BeaumontIn haste Jeremiah got that letter off to Bowling Green  --  or a letter similar to it , for this is the version he reconstructs in his narrative . But he only summarizes Wilkie 's reply , which came after considerabledelay . " I had waited with impatience for my friend 's word , feelingthat I could not proceed with the Purpose until confirmed by him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absent on business , and assured me of his willingness to serve me in any way possible , and of his confidence in my judgment . But then Wilkie spoke with alarm , saying he surmised the occasion and begging me to do nothing rash . He pointed to the complexity of the unnamed circum- p 120stance , and said that he regretted his own ill-considered words spoken on the subject in his house in Bowling Green . In principle , he said , he retracted nothing , nor would any man of chivalry , nor would he urge me to be less than honorable and keen-hearted . But Justice , too , must be consulted , and therefore evidence , and thereupon he spoke like a lawyer for some space . Most of all , however , he was troubled by the fact that the one whom he did not name but assumed to be my opponent was carrying the fight for the good of the State and for the salvation and very livelihood of thousands . He asked if a private man , under those conditions , should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public need . As for himself , he worked much for it , and in fact was about to go on a journey to Lexington and other towns and would be absent for some time . But he assured me that if I saw fit he would sacrifice what little he could do for his State to the dictates of his friendship , and that a letter might be forwarded to him from his house in Bowling Green . He begged me , however , to think seriously on all he had said , for he wrote from the heart , and to pray on my decision if I retained a Faith in our Religion . He said he knew me to be as just as fearless , and trusted my decision . He ended thus , and I read again the letter which was almost as long as a book . " Jeremiah at first felt nothing but anger and a sense of betrayal . This was not the ardent and generous friend he had known but somebody " full of buts and ifs and howevers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a friend if not the person whom you had to trust . Had he not seen at Lumton how Wilkie had risked himself for a cause and a man whom he thought to be right ? Jeremiah almost wavered from his purpose . For a day and night he suffered in an agony of doubt . By fits and starts he felt selfish and mean in comparison with Wilkie , who was giving himself for the public good . He remembered Skrogg , and how that rickety form had moved deliberately up to the gang at the steps of the courthouse . He even remembered Colonel Fort . He had not remembered Colonel Fort for a long time . In one way , Colonel Fort had ceased to exist for Jeremiah the very night when Wilkie had identified him as the betrayer of Rachel Jordan . He had become , as it were , an abstraction , a name only , without face or hands or feet . Even the bestial image that had appeared for a moment on the couch before the hearth in the Jordan library had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Fort , " Jeremiah writes , " but its face was turned from me . " Now , however , if only for a moment , Colonel Fort became a reality again , sitting by his fireside , talking like a friend or father , speaking of the law , or with his sad face sadder with the thought of a man'sp 121responsibility in the hard times , saying , " We live in the world , boy , and when the sun is down it is a place of darkness and the foot knowethnot the way . " At that recollection , which came with sudden vividnesslike a fleshy presence , Jeremiah felt the old warmth and the old gratitude . But there was nothing there , except the empty room , with the fire dying on the hearth and the candle guttering in its socket , and the  --  night chill creeping in through the very walls . And he could not think what he might have said had Colonel Fort been there before him . What would he have said ? What would there have been to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror . It was terror at the thought that he might have betrayed himself , betrayed the obligation laid upon him , betrayed what was the very meaning of his life . If he betrayed it , he could never go back to face Rachel Jordan . He would have to wander away  --  where ?  --  somewhere West , somewhere in the wild country , never finding a place to rest , never finding any rest within himself because he would know that he could not trust himself and therefore was nothing . He had almost fallen into another trap . But he had been saved by the emptiness of the room . It was well to know that such a trap existed . Ah , he was lucky , he was forewarned , he would walk with a cunning foot . His decision was made . Let Wilkie and Skrogg and Fort be what they were . He , Jeremiah Beaumont , would have to be what he was . And if Fort did good , could that wipe out his evil ? " Could it seal my ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the small grave , Too late  --  too late  --  for the world is all ruined ' ? " Before going to bed that night he wrote to Wilkie to say that he had thought deeply over Wilkie 's letter but had found no abiding reason why he should change his own course . That he was honored by Wilkie 's expression of confidence and thanked him for his willingness to second him . That if an encounter should develop , he hoped that time and place might be arranged to suit Wilkie 's personal convenience and to interfere as little as possible with Wilkie 's pursuit of the public good . That he would notify Wilkie immediately of the course of things . Then he slept . The next morning he wrote another letter , this to Colonel Fort . He had been informed that Colonel Fort had returned home from Frankfortand would be there for some days . So he gave the letter to a servant at the Barron house with instructions to give the letter only into the Colonel 's hands . The letter was simply a request that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in the p 122near future and at some point other than his own home or the Barron house . The servant did not return until late in the evening , shortly before supper . He still had the letter . Colonel Fort had left home the day before , quite unexpectedly . The news was , as Jeremiah records , a great vexation to him . His first impulse was to mount a horse , not waiting for supper , and start out upon the roads , asking as he went . But that was crazy , he knew . It was a big country , " and the tracks and trails were many , north and south . " He would have to wait for the Colonel 's return , or for secure word of his whereabouts . That was his commonsense determination , but everything seemed empty to him and the time of waiting a burdenand a horror . It was a burden that he had not anticipated , and he had to brace himself to bear it , " for the burden of the emptiness of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of waiting he could not go back to Rachel Jordan . He had said that he would return when the deed was done , and the deed had not even been begun . He tried to go back to his books , back to the law , and he did succeed in finding there a kind of relief . It was a relief because it was so far from what he felt to be the flow and fullness of life . He remembered how he had felt this when he first began to read law with Mr. Talbot , but how Colonel Fort had showed the law to be mankind 's servant , a vessel for mankind 's best hope , and a " glove for the hand of Justice . " But now again Jeremiah felt that if the law was mankind 's servant , it was " a dull and stutteringone , " and if the glove of the hand of justice it was " a glove so crude and thick that the grasp of justice would always fumble . " Looking back on that time , he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the heart was struck ? I asked where was the voice of Justice but in the heart ? And all a man could hope was that his heart was pure and its sentiments corrected and refined . I had read much history and knew how the mass of men lived by the law as by a common pact and accord , but I also knew how we give honor to those men ( and to that One greater than man but in man 's body ) who struck against the Law for justice 's sake and the voice from deep within . The Fathers of our Country had struck against the law they were born to . My own old father had worn his sword as traitor to a law his heart denied , but as servant to Justice . And I asked myself how may we know that Justice is in the heart ? There is no one to tell us . It is like a game , I said to myself , in which we place our coin upon a card , then turn the card to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no is truly pictured the kingly face of justice . " Ah , but  --  and I put the last sad query to myself  --  can we ever see the other side of the card ? Who will tell us ? For if we trust for truth p 123the outcome of the event , and make success our god , wherefore are we better than the vulgar thief who feels himself no thief if he escapes in the dark with the purse ? Or if we trust the common opinion and seek general approbation , why trust the heart at all ? We had done better to stifle its voice and not stray from the path of practice which wins the nods of old men and the fat prizes of the world . No , I said to myself , we are thrown back to trust the heart at its first whisper , and so I would leap up from my book or tormented thought and ride to the tavern for news that might bear on my obligation and design . " But there was no news for many days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Mr. Barron , by the fire in the big family room behind the parlor , where the hanks of yarn hung from the beamed ceiling above the spinning wheel and the firelight gleamed on brass or pewter and a kettle simmered on the crane , to keep water hot for the old man 's grog . Old Mr. Barron had earned his drink with its bit of cinnamon , and the long winter evening by the fire . He had done what men do and had done it well . He had worked , loved , fought , kept his word , given charity , cleared land , raised children , paid his debts , been just to his servants , prayed to his God , read his Bible , feared no man . He had brought light into darkness and civilization to the wild places , as Jeremiah put it , and now he sat before the fire and told a young man , who was his guest , how life had been . He told how the weather had been on a morning long ago in Virginia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " He had once shaken Patrick Henry 's hand . He showed the tomahawk scar on his left shoulder . He told how the freshet had flooded his corn in 1780 , and what it was like to be hungryin a new country . He named his children , the dead and living , their faults and their virtues , " girls bounden to duty and good boys fair to middlin , and never one to give me shame . " He told how he had first seen his wife in North Carolina , the year before he crossed the mountains . She was on her way to church , a young girl riding a fat little pony down a lane in North Carolina , just behind her father and mother , in spring " at the time between blossom and leaf . " Barronhad stood aside under a tree to let them pass . The girl had not observed him . She looked very sleepy on her pony , not really awake yet , with the drowsy freshness of " a child still abed . " Barron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yawn . He saw how pink her lips were and saw her " little pink tongue curl and how white the little teeth were and even-placed . " He had not known her name , he told Jeremiah , but he had known that she was the girl for him . He had n't been wrong , he said . He had been a smart one , he said , and she had lived with him forty years , and now she was buried on his place . p 124He had been a smart one , he said . He had been a lucky one , he said . He had no complaints , he said , and he told Jeremiah , evening after evening , what life had been like . It was what life had been like to old Tom Barron , Thomas Bartlett Barron , a series of pictures with their colors faded in time , a series of words in an old man 's creaky voice . There had been something else , Jeremiah thought . But where was it ? Where was the life of Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the life of Jeremiah Beaumont . Then the news came . It was a newspaper , four days old , from Frankfort , a copy of the Advocate . Jeremiah saw it at the tavern . It said that Colonel Cassius Fort would address a gathering of patriotic citizens in Frankfort on the burning question of the hour , " Justice and Relief . " The next morning at dawn , Jeremiah set out for Frankfort . It was after dark on the fourth day when he approached Frankfort . It was by now the season of sugar-making , and long before he saw the few lights of the town , he saw the fires here and there in the woods of the sugar camps . They spotted the country around in the maple groves , getting brighter and brighter as dark came on , then in the full dark like stars far off , for you could not see where the darkness of a hillside left off and the darkness of the sky began . Sometimes Jeremiahcould hear singing from the camps , or the sound of a fiddle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or gay . He passed one camp just off the roadside , and they hailed him in the dark . He drew rein , then moved into the circle of firelight . There were twelve or fifteen people there , a few children red in the face and merry , some young girls and young men in couples holding hands or boldly hugging , laughing and humming , some older people cooking meat over the fire and slicing bread , and one old man with a fiddle , seated on a chunk of wood , plucking the strings softly with one finger , waiting to begin again . " Git down and eat , good friend , " one of the older men ordered Jeremiah . He refused politely , saying that he was already benighted . " A man 's got to eat , " the man said and slapped his good belly , " and you wo n't find no better meat no where . I raised hit and I know . Git down , good friend ! " He refused again , saying he hoped to give no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , friend , " another man said . " Maybe a man do n't have to eat , but a man 's got to drink . " He stepped to the stirrup and held up a bottle . " Here , sir , drink it for friendship ! " Jeremiah took the bottle , drank , wiped his lips , spoke his thanks , p 125and again lifted the reins . But a girl laid hand to his bridle , and held something up to him . She was a big bouncing girl , with yellow hair and full cheeks bright from the heat of the fire and the Slow of excitement . " Take it , " she said , laughing boldly up at him , take it , pretty boy , for it 's warm sugar ! " He reached down and she pressed it into his hand , her fingers warm and damp to his palm as she gave it to him . " Thank you , " he said , and turned away on his road . As he moved away , he heard her laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then another , then all the voices . He rode away from the sugar camp and the winter picnic to the tune of the boatman 's song of the Ohio , the song of the broadhorns and the keelboats : All the way from Shawneetown , Long time ago . As he rode , he ate the sugar bit by bit . It was sweet and crumbly and warm to his tongue , tasting faintly of smoke with its sweetness , yet making him think that sunshine might taste like that " if you could boil it down like sap and hold it warm in your hand . " Then he reached the brow of the hill , saw the lights of Frankfort below him in the valley by the river , a few lights reflected in the black water , and the black mass of hills beyond . The music had stopped now . He abandoned his fancy , and rode down into the town . It was a strange town to him . He had never been here before , to the capital of the State . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on into the middle of town . He was not much impressed with what he saw , but he confesses that later he was to admire , even in his disturbedstate of being , the great houses of the town . He mentions one house , Liberty Hall , which " the great Thomas Jefferson had designed for John Brown , the first Senator from our State , and which I regarded with reverence as the work of that mind . " Tonight , however , he was rnerely lost in a strange , dark town , where the lights were going out , a little town of some 2,000 people , on a bend of a river under the hills . He found himself in the middle of town , facing a square in which , well back from the street , he saw a sizable edifice among bare trees . That , he knew , must be the capitol . Then he saw a man making his way across the square , and hailed him . He asked the way to the Weisiger House . The man told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it near the river . At the hotel the barman who showed him up remarked that he was lucky in not having to share a bed with some other guest tonight , for the town was not full . Jeremiah stretched out , and though tired from his long journey , did not go immediately to sleep . He lay there peacefully and " thought on the strangeness of things and how I might have rid- p 126den here into this dark town on a thousand different errands , and no one the wiser , for I lay there in my room and no one of all the hundredslocked up in their houses knew my name and I did not know theirs or what thoughts they slept with . " Then after hearing the watch call twice in the street toward the river , he fell asleep . He rose early the next morning , breakfasted well in a big room downstairs with a dozen other men , and then went out to stroll the town . He did not want to inquire for Colonel Fort unless that became necessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This desire was instinctive , he says , and had in it no desire for secrecy , for the duel he intended to fight would be known to the world . It was late afternoon before he encountered Colonel Fort . Jeremiah recognized him at a distance of some forty paces . The Colonel was standing on the pavement of the Mansion House in earnest discourse with two other men , " gentlemen who looked prosperous and severe like those accustomed to direct great affairs . " ( He later identified one of the men as Governor John Adair himself . ) Jeremiah did not closely approach the group . He stopped some fifteenpaces away , out of range of Colonel Fort 's vision , and waited for the conversation to break up . Meanwhile , he inspected Colonel Fort , the blunt , powerful , black-coated figure , the thick legs set wide apart on the pavement , the hands clasped behind holding a beaver hat , the heavy head leaning forward a little with its mane of unruly hair . The hair looked grayer now , but at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ( the Governor ) made a violent gesture with his hand , at which Colonel Fort shook his head slowly , seeming " to oppose some inner and weighty sureness to the asseveration of the other . " That motion of Colonel Fort 's head seemed to end the conference . Immediately afterward , the two men took their leave of him , and he moved down the street in Jeremiah 's direction . He did not , however , see Jeremiah . He walked with his head still bowed , his hat still held in the clasped hands over his rump . At his slow pace he came even with Jeremiah before Jeremiah spoke . " Colonel Fort , " Jeremiah said , not loud , and the head lifted slowly and turned toward him . In that moment Jeremiah was struck by the change on the face . " I had not seen him for many months , " he writes , " and had not thought how time might have made its mark . It was the face of the man I had known , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more loose on the bone and drooped to make more pronouncedthe deep wrinkles on each side of the mouth and to hang at the sides of the chin , and the swarthy color was somewhat streaked p 127with yellow and pasty . The characteristic melancholy of his face in repose was there more strongly , and rested there for the instant he looked at me without recognition . Then he knew me , and smiled , and came toward me and put forth his hand , saying , Well , my boy , well met , ' and such words to express pleasure . I took his hand without thinking , and immediately regretted the act which had taken me off guard . But at least , then , I gave him no greeting or expression of pleasure . " Colonel Fort , ' I said , I have come to speak with you on a matter of utmost gravity . ' " I would speak with you , ' he replied . " Let us walk apart more privately , ' I suggested , and he agreed , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northwardin the direction it takes after it makes the second bend . He began to speak , but I said for us to wait . I myself did not feel at the moment prepared to speak . First , I was in some agitation , which I hoped not to show , and second , when I spoke I wished it to be fully and with no interruption by the chance passer . So we moved on down the frozen track beyond the last houses into a place where trees made a grove by the river , though bare now , and dead brush screened us from the world . As we walked into the grove , I stared northward up the river , where the water looked like gray steel in the declining light , and at the rugged hills there . Then I turned to him , and said , Colonel Fort , I have something to .. " But he interrupted me : My boy , I have something to tell you . I wrote you a letter . Did you receive it ? ' " I nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , ' I replied . " If I have offended you , ' he began , if I gave you so little justice . . " You gave me justice , ' I said bitterly . " Justice , ' he echoed . Then continued : But , Jerry . . " My name is Beaumont , ' I exclaimed . " He looked at me strangely , and shook his head slowly , then smiled again . You are Jerry to me , ' he said . You have been Jerry to me for a long time . ' Then he put forth his hand and laid it on my shoulder . " I trembled with rage and jerked from him . I am Beaumont to you , ' I cried , and I am your enemy ! ' " My enemy ? ' " Your enemy , ' I said , and you know why , and I will not be distracted by pretended kindness and would be to God I had never received any at your hands , nor will I be bought by such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort said . I do n't know what you speak of . I swear I do not . ' " Lying should be little to you , ' I interrupted , after your practice in treachery . ' " He stared at me , and shook his head but so slightly that I scarcely knew it , and he wet his lips as though about to speak but unable to find words . " Are you silent ? ' I demanded . " He still did not speak , but continued to regard me . " I have called you a liar , ' I said . Can you find no words to challengeme ? ' " I could not challenge you , ' he said , very slowly . " But I can challenge you , ' I said , and will ! ' " He stood there , very stolid and heavy , regarding me without answer for a little , so that I repeated my words . Then he said : Why should you challenge me ? ' " I took a step toward him and stared him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " I saw the blood flee from his face , streaking it more sallow beneath the old swarthiness , and making the skin look thin , and for an instant he seemed to recoil from my words . Then he shook his head like one who would deny what he knows , and spoke , but spoke moreto himself than to me , very low . So .. : he said . So . . " Your conscience should attest that truth , ' I replied . " Yes , ' he said , still more to himself than to me , my conscience . ' Then he seemed to sink within himself , denying my presence . " But I would not have it so , and said : I have not come to prick your conscience . That is too late . I have come to fight you . ' " Why must you fight me ? ' he asked . What is done is done . And I would to God it had not been . ' Then he looked searchingly at me , and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight ? ' " Ca n't you understand ? ' he asked again , softly now . Then still looking at me , he burst out : My God , ca n't you understand ? ' " I understand this much , ' I said . That I love Miss Jordan , and I will fight you for her . Now will you fight ? ' " Listen , ' he said . I can not fight you . I can not fight any man on this point . If a man should come at me with a penknife and the name of Rachel Jordan on his lips , and I held a sword , I could not lift it . If he came with a little stick and I held a pistol primed and full , I could not pull the trigger . I could not fight any man . And least of all could I fight you . Not you , my boy . ' " You will , ' I cried , for she has promised to be my wife . ' " At that he reached out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 129me , but I jerked back from it , even as he said , Your wife . ' And said again : Your wife . ' Then said : She is a woman of goodness and a great heart . She is made to give man happiness . She will give you happiness , for she .. " Stop ! ' I commanded , I will not have your tongue foul her by speaking fair . For you have no right . ' " No , ' he said , heavily , no , I have no right . ' " For the last time  --  will you fight me a duel ? ' " No , ' he said . " So I struck him a smack across the face , and felt his nose go flat beneath the palm of my hand . He winced and his eyes blinked and moisture came to them with the pain . Then , looking at me , he lifted one hand to his face and touched it , and his nose , where I had struck him . " My God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duel now ? ' " He shook his head . No , ' he said , I would not hurt you . ' " Hurt me ! ' I cried , and my anger was so great at his words that I did not know what to do . Hurt me ! Listen , you can not turn my purposeby any pretended love to me , for I know what your love is worth . I have sworn to kill you . I swore it to her . She said , " Kill Fort , " andI swore that I . . " He started at me , and I thought him ready to fight and felt gladnessand lifted my arm . Then he stopped . She  --  she . . . ' he began , and his face was streaked pasty , and his lips worked without words . Then he said : She  --  she said it ? She said  --  to kill  --  me ? ' " Yes , by God , ' I said , and found joy in the words . She said , " Kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . " ' " He stood heavily , with his arms hanging at his sides , and his lips moving without words , as before . Then he uttered , Oh  --  oh , ' twice , deep and tight in his throat , like a man who chokes . " Therefore , I will kill you , ' I said , and took a dirk from my shirt . " He looked at it like a strange thing , and made no move . " Are you armed ? ' I demanded . For if you will not fight a duel , I 'll fight you here . Are you armed ? ' " He shook his head . " Then I took out another knife , a Spanish knife , and held them both to him . Take your choice , ' I ordered him , and be damned to you . ' " He did not move . " My God , ' I exclaimed , I 'll make you fight now , duel or no ! ' So I flung one knife at his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized his throat and raised the dirk and with the dirk still held aloft , tried to force him down . Pick it up ! ' I commanded . Pick up the knife or I strike you in the heart . ' p 130 " I felt him give at the knees , and his hat fell off , and I leaned with him to be ready if he should seize the knife and make to stab me in the stomach . Suddenly he dropped , so sharply that he almost escaped from my grasp on his throat . He fell heavily to his knees on the ground , but he did not reach for the knife . Pick it up ! ' I commanded . Pick it up , or I 'll kill you . ' " I  --  have lived '  --  he said , thick and slow for my hand on his throat  --  ' long enough . ' " Pick it up ! ' I cried in desperation . " Long enough , ' he said , and I know what  --  life  --  is worth ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted my dirk for the blow . " Kill me  --  if you will , ' he said . I do not care  --  for myself  --  but my wife  --  sick .. " Your wife ! Oh , you villain , ' I said , your wife ! I 'll avenge her too . ' " He was going black in the face from my choking , and his breath was slow and wheezing . I looked down in his face , and thought that I would do it that instant . I thought I would do it the next instant . Then he said : Do it  --  do it  --  if she said . . " She said ! ' I cried , And I will do it . ' And I lifted the dirk high again . " But I did not do it . I was determined to do it , but I could not . It was more than I could do , and in that way . It was not his wheedling or his acting for sympathy , as I took it to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , with him on the ground before me and his face black with my grip on his throat and his breath making its sound . If he had said one more word I could have done it , but he did not speak again . " So all at once I thrust him from me , so hard that he fell back on one elbow with his knees bent beneath him . I had thrust him from me without judgment or intention , simply because I could not do otherwise . I stood there and trembled , as though I had been the one to suffer in the encounter . " Then I took a grip on myself and said : Do you think you have escaped . I will horsewhip you in the streets of Frankfort , tomorrow , before the eyes of the town . I will shame you to a duel . ' " He stared up at me and did not speak , his free hand feeling his throat for the soreness . " No , ' he said huskily then . Do not . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " No , ' he said . Do what you will now , but not in the street . ' " In the street , ' I said , and be prepared . ' " I beg you , ' he said , leave me my good name . ' " What good name can you have , you coward and villain ? ' I demanded , and looked down at him in my contempt . Then I turned p 131from him , leaving him there on the ground , and hurried out of the grove in the direction of the town . " The sun was setting now , very red and low across the river , as when the weather promises cold . I felt chilled through and walked fast to heat myself . I was well toward the town before I had to stop by a tangle of old blackberry bushes to puke . " The next morning as soon as the stores were open , Jeremiah went out and bought the whip , a strong one with long lash and heavy stock , loaded with lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol in his pocket he walked slowly about the square , where the capitol was , then down Washington Street toward the river , then to the Mansion House and back around the square . It was a morning " brisk to bitter , " but there was fine sun , which " called many forth on business or to enjoy the cheerfulness . " But in the well-populated street , Jeremiah found no Colonel Fort . Then he worked the taverns and resorts of the town . The next day passed in the same fashion . On the third morning , he learned that after a day of keeping to his room with a fever , ColonelFort had left and was already a day 's ride on the Lexington road . So Jeremiah rushed back to the Weisiger House , packed his saddle bags , paid his score , ordered his horse , and took the eastern road up from the valley of the town . Colonel Fort was not in Lexington , and Jeremiah got no news by his discreet inquiries in the public places . But Wilkie Barron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , near the Phoenix , easy and elegant in a new dark-blue coat with brass buttons and black varnished boots " so bright you could shave with one for a mirror . " He was engaged in familiar conversation with an erect , solid man of upward of fifty years , who wore severe black and carried a gold-headed stick . When Wilkie saw his friend approach , his face broke into its " quick smile , " and he rushed to greet him , holding out his hand with " enthusiasm . " He drew Jeremiah to the man in black , and said , " Mr. Madison  --  Senator Madison  --  this is my dear friend Jerry Beaumont , the man I told you of , that Skrogg told you of , the man who did such service at Lumton  --  he has n't got an ounce of fear in him . Oh , he 's a Reliefer at heart ! " " Good , " Mr. Madison said . " Good . " He regarded Jeremiah with his severe gray eyes , calculating him as a sportsman might calculate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded of the day when he had first met his grandfather Marcher and the old man had looked at him that way and had made him move into the light and had prodded him with his stick . He almost expected Mr. Madison p 132to tap him with the gold-headed stick , and a hint of the boyish shame and anger of years before flickered in him for the instant . But Mr. Madison was saying that he felt honored to meet him , that he had heard his name with respect from more than one mouth , that they hoped to make a good Relief er out of him , And meanwhile he had shaken Jeremiah 's hand with a firm grip . Then he invited him to join them at dinner , for he and Wilkie were together to discuss affairs of the party and would like to hear his views and a word from Saul County . Jeremiah mumbled out some thanks and excuses . He had to be on the road , he said . Then , gracelessly , he said that he had to speak with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With " some distance now in his civility , " Mr. Madison left them , and Jeremiahturned immediately to Wilkie . " Have you seen Fort ? " he demanded . Wilkie shook his head . " Do you know where he is ? " Wilkie took Jeremiah closely by the arm . " This is what I feared , " he said , leaning intimately to his friend . " I beg you to give up . " " My mind is decided , " Jeremiah said . " It is not too late , " Wilkie urged . " All wisdom is against it , and all ... " " Wisdom ! " Jeremiah broke in . " What wisdom ? And what wisdom could alter the fact ? " " The fact ? " " The fact that Rachel Jordan was betrayed . And the fact that she has promised to be my wife . " " Ah , " Wilkie exclaimed , " ah , " and tightened his grip on Jeremiah 's arm . " You are a happy man , " he said warmly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and he smiled  --  " could envy you . For you know in what esteem I hold her and how once I . . . " Then you understand me , " Jeremiah cut him off . " Then you see what I must do . " " Listen to me , " Wilkie said . " You are about to marry a woman who is one among the thousands . Your duty is to make her happy . But the course you now pursue is only misery , and most of all , for her . But you can give her happiness and comfort . You have the gifts for success and for . . . " " Success ! " Jeremiah exclaimed . " The success I want is . . . " You can have it . Listen , a man like Madison  --  you impress him , he knows of you , what you have done and the keenness of your mind . You could come to Lexington , to the law , you could be of use in the party "  --  Wilkie spoke quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madison , he is powerful and great and . . . " p 133Jeremiah looked Wilkie squarely in the face . " Is that why , " he asked slowly , " is that why you follow him ? Him and Fort ? " Wilkie released his grip on Jeremiah 's arm . He stood there before him , shaking his fine-shaped head , wearing a faint , mournful smile on his handsome , smooth face . " Jerry , " he asked softly , " do you really think that ? " Jeremiah could not answer . " Do you think that ? Of me ? " Shame flooded over Jeremiah . " No , " he said , shaking his head . " No , I could n't think that . " He knew he could not think it . He could not afford to think it . As he had said the words a blankness , a sense of loss , had drained his heart . " No , " he repeated , " no . " Wilkie clapped him on the shoulder , and seized the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he said . " That 's my old Jerry . " Jeremiah stood there under the hand , in his shame and confusion . " A drink ! " Wilkie exclaimed . " What we need is a drink . A beaker of the best of Old Kaintuck to beat this confounded cold . Come on , my boy ! " Jeremiah shook his head . " Come on , we 'll have a drink . Then dinner with old Madison . Oh , you ought to hear him talk , you ... " " Good-bye , " Jeremiah said , and turned away . He had taken two long strides away , before he heard Wilkie call his name . He looked back . " I beg you , " Wilkie said , " remember what l have said . I beg you . " " Good-bye , " Jeremiah said , and raised the whip in salute , and walked fast down the street , toward the stables . As he turned the corner he caught a glimpse of Wilkie Barron still standing on the pavement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . He would hunt Fort in Bowling Green . He had not even waited to take food before leaving . He would eat tonight where he found lodging , at some house on the way . But he rode on long past dark . He was now entering the region he had first known when he came to visit his unknown grandfather , Old Marcher , and he thought of his old errand in that part , and how then , as now , he had gone away in the end , heading south , in the dark . But there was one difference between then and now . Then he had gone away , blind , toward nothing , toward a future completely shrouded in darkness . Now , he moved through the dark , and into a ( lark future , but he felt like a man who sees , far off , a light , . a spark , in the middle of the blackness and knows that he will find there what he seeks. p 134The journey was for nothing . Jeremiah records no details , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Fort had been there , had showed himself in the streets , had transacted some business regarding lands in litigation to the west , and had left again . So Jeremiah , after giving his horse rest for some thirty-six hours , returned to the Barron house , thinking that Colonel Fort might have gone home and that he , Jeremiah , might catch him sooner or later at the tavern or in the settlement . The day after his arrival at the Barron house , he wrote a letter to Rachel Jordan , saying that he had failed in his mission because Fort had refused to fight , but that he was determined to provoke him by whipping him in public and with that intention had sought him in both Lexington and Bowling Green . He added that he would not seek her out until he could come with his promise fulfilled . The servant returned with no answer . After the first moment of disappointment , Jeremiah decided that he had no right to expect an answer . There was nothing to be said between them . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did receive a communication from Rachel Jordan , three words only , " This came yesterday , " signed " R. " The " this " was a letter from Colonel Fort , dated from Hopkinsville , in the southwest of the state . The letter , which has been preserved for us , runs : Dear Miss Jordan : I would I had the privilege of addressing you less formally , but I fear that you will resent that I address you at all . But I beg you to read this for I must vent the distress of spirit which is mine and trust to that nobility of heart which I know to be yours . There recently came to me at Frankfort the young man Jeremiah Beaumont , whom I have known and for whom I entertain esteem and affection , knowing him to have an ardent and quick spirit , as readily inflamed to high emprize as any Bayard . In his generous chivalry and by his love for you ( he told me you have promised to bestow yourselfupon him ) , he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I said I would fight him no duel and would not defend myself against him , do what he would . He made to stab me , but stayed his hand . Then he threatened to whip me in the street until I should fight him . Whereupon he left me , but not before he had told me that you commanded my death as a price for happiness . Miss Jordan , I beg you to believe that I am not afraid of death . That I have exposed my breast in personal quarrel and in the quarrelof my dear country , the public voice will instruct you . I have done so in my greener years when life and ambition were sweet . Should I not do so now with better heart when after forty years Ip 135taste the lees of life ? Believe me , I do not write you in fear of death . Indeed , when Beaumont told me you willed my death , my last love of life , though of life in the memorized past , fled from me and I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parted from you , I did not guess such sentiment on your part , and in my own anguish I could perceive your high mind and dignity and feel that in the hopeless case God granted me a glimpse of worth beyond the mortal mark . Do not rob me of that thought and poison what joy I hope to carry with me to the end , in the recollection of your society . As I do not write in fear I do not write for extenuation . I confess me wrong , and bitterly , for I was weak to take by stealth what was not mine to take . Oh , I was weak and foolish to think that I could have a joy that burst upon my sight so late when I was old and in the toils of life . I betrayed you and betrayed others who trusted me , compounding betrayal by betrayal , and for those months I lived in a dream outside the hard world and its duties . Then I came back into the world , and hope to do my duty still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and losses . I speak of myself . But do not think I do not know what you have endured . Could I have made your lot more easy , I had thrust my hand into the fire . You sent me back into the world to play what part in it I could with my poor rags of honor left . That was your great soul and courage , beforewhich I bowed my head . Oh , now do not rob me of that thought , for it is the thought by which I have been able to live . As I beg this for my own sake , I beg it for your own , and for the sake of the poor boy Beaumont . He is worthy of you in so far as man may be worthy of a woman like yourself . Take happiness with him , and do not stain your heart with hate or his hand with blood  --  however guilty that blood may be . And it is guilty blood . But it came to guilt , not by coldness and in the calculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , forgetful of the nature of things , and the debt it owed to the world . I would say one more thing . I will not fight Jeremiah Beaumont a duel , I can not fight in a bad cause . I will not duel him even if he whip me in the street . But I would , if possible , be spared that shame . I bear , I trust , the name of manhood and hope to bear it still and to the end . It is a vanity , I know , to love the bubble reputation , but leave me what little worth I have . And there is one fear in me . I might  --  though God forbid  --  in the heat of the moment and in the weakness of my vanity do what I would regret most bitterly and by a last crime make worse my earlier crimes . This is not a threat . I know that boy to be of mettle beyond such use . As for the future , I shall go about the country as before , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I fled Frankfort , though not in fear for life . I shall flee no more . " There is a destiny that shapes our ends rough hew them how we may . " Your obedient servant , Cassius FortJeremiah stood under a bare tree in front of the Barron house , in the middle of a winter afternoon , and read the letter . He read it over and over again , not moving . It shook him . Then he looked again at the single sheet with the three words from Rachel Jordan . How had she taken the letter ? He asked himself that , then thought that the bareness of her words told him all . She had rejected Fort 's letter , and was unchanged . Then he asked why he himself should be changed by it . His eyes fell on Fort 's sentence , " This is not a threat . " And the distress the letter had stirred suddenly crystallized in him as anger . It was a threat . And he would not be threatened . By God , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick , a threat to him , and to Rachel Jordan a sniveling , flattering , cringing. self-pitiful attempt to play on womanly weakness and softness of heart , to blow up what warmth of feeling might remain for the man she had held in her arms . And at that thought , there in broad daylight , Jeremiah had the vision again he had had in the firelit library of the Jordan house . " I saw the act which had been performed upon the couch , and knew the horror of it and my jealousy to defend her , and knew how with foul cunning he now tried to stir her blood to save his own , and how she had sent the letter to me to prove that she was above the baseness of his thought . I hardened then my mind . " And Jeremiah had a sudden inspiration . He might combat cunning with cunning . If Fort could stoop , then one might stoop with Fort , and snare him in his own snare . Rachel Jordan might reply , and reply fair , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at a certain hour , after he had returned to his home from the western part . Fort would have to ride through the settlement from his house to the Jordanhouse , and Jeremiah might lie in wait in the settlement and there call him to account with . the whip , before all eyes . Jeremiah rushed into the house , seized quill and paper and began to write . He finished the letter , outlining his plan , and then stopped to read it over . He paused . What had seemed right and justifiable in his moment of passion just before in the yard , now in the black words on the white paper offended him . Fort had been cunning and had stooped , but he could not stoop . Something would be gone and lost . He tore the sheet into small bits and threw them into the fire . He felt that he had escaped another trap laid in his path . If he had p 137written the letter , if he had sent it to Rachel , she might have resented in horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she would have done that . And he would have lost her forever . And he would , too , have lost himself . So there was nothing to do but wait for his opportunity to execute in his own way the deed which Rachel Jordan had confirmed by sending him Fort 's letter and her own terse message . But had she intended to confirm the deed ? Or had Colonel Fort 's letter shaken her heart and her resolve , as it shook Jeremiah 's ? Late in the record , when things had spun themselves nearly out to the end , we find some indication that Rachel herself was shaken . And if she was shaken , why did she send the letter to Jeremiah with no hint as to her own feeling ? We can only surmise that she could not resolve her own feelings , that she was torn by their contradictions , and that she passed the decision on to Jeremiah as you flip a coin or draw a card , passing on to him , or to fate , the responsibility . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irony , for Jeremiah resolved his own conflict of feeling by an appeal to her . He took the bareness of her own note to mean that she had rejected Fort 's letter . Suppose they had read Fort 's letter , side by side . Then the doubt in her eyes and the doubt in Jeremiah 's might have met as they looked up from e he sheet , and all would have been different . Or perhaps not . Perhaps the decision answered Jeremiah 's deepest need , after all . In any case , he now entered up a period of waiting , a period in which " night and day wore the same face . " He writes : " I seemed to live outside of time , and nothing about me was real but the thought in me . What was real was the moment I strove toward , which was not yet in time . When that moment should fall into the stream of time , I thought that again time and the world would be real to me. lint not before . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his passion for Rachel Jordan grew . Not being before his eyes , she obsessed him more than during the time when he had seen her almost daily . The moment when he should strike Fort and the moment when he should at last take her into his arms fused into one moment , the two acts became one act , the secret of life , and all that lay between him and the act was ugly and meaningless . He saw her face constantly before him , " but far off and like something glimmering in the dark . " He could not come to her , he knew , until the deed was done . But he came . He did not come because he was not strong enough to maintain his resolve , but because she called him . One of the Jordan Negroes brought the note . She had to see him , she said . Her mother was very sick , almost at the point of death . She herself was weak p 138enough in her distress to call for the comfort of his presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn . So he went . He found her pale and cold , wearing a black dress , and a black shawl about her shoulders . Her face had none of its autumnal richness now . The inner warmth and glow had withdrawn or been drained away . The skin looked drawn and strained , and when she spoke , her pale lips seemed stiff as with cold . Her face was so pale that the brown spot on her left cheek , and even the little freckles , which had seemed absorbed into the glow of her flesh and to be the marks of the warm , fecund vitality of her blood , now seemed to be nothing but extrinsic stains sharply marring the pallor of her face . She was not beautiful now . Jeremiah says as much , but adds , " The tact that her beauty had fled away , as though in the short space time had done its cruel work of half a lifetime , touched my heart so that tears sprung to my eyes and I was caught in the pathos of that fugacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , drawing the shawl tight about her shoulders , twisting her hands in the shawl , and he noticed how white the skin was on the knuckles . " Thank you for coming , " she said , as stiff and formalas though he were a stranger who had done her a casual courtesy . He drew her right hand from the shawl , kissed it , and said that he was hers to command . She told him that Mrs. Jordan had been ill for more than a week and had been growing steadily worse . She had been by turns unconscious and delirious for two days . She was now unconscious . The doctor was due to come today , Dr. Thomas , who lived on a farm over near Lumton . She recited this in a cold voice , not even looking at Jeremiah while she spoke . She had scarcely finished when there was a noise on the porch . Dr. Thomas had arrived . Rachel took him upstairs to the patient , and Jeremiah found his way to the library . The fire there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than before . Jeremiah went to the hearth , and , as he leaned there , he had the old feeling that he was being spied on . But he knew there would be no yellowish drawn face floating beyond in the shadows of the side hall to peer at him . He knew that those secret , vindictive eyes belonged to another time , now past , and that he had moved into a new time . After a little Rachel came down to him , leaving the doctor above . There was no change , she reported . Then she lapsed into silence , drawing the shawl about her shoulders , clutching it . There was , finally , the sound of the doctor 's tread on the stairs , and Rachel rose and went out . Jeremiah heard the front door close , and she returned to him . Her mother , she said , was no better , perhaps worse . Jeremiah murmured some sort of sympathetic reply , and stepped aside for her to enter the library . p 139She did not enter . Jeremiah waited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come . I thank you for coming . But now  --  now wo n't you go ? " " But you asked me to come . . . " he began . But she interrupted , " I did . I asked you to come , but I was weak . I was a fool to think anybody can help me . " She twisted the edge of the shawl in her finger . He said he wanted to be with her , to be of service , but she stopped him . " Go , " she said , " go now  --  get out of this house  --  you should never have come here , never , it is a terrible place . Go while you can . " Jeremiah felt a cold clutch at his heart . " You talk , " he said to her , " you talk like she did . Here in this hall . That day . Like your mother did . " " I speak for myself , " she said , " and I say , go now . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go now , " he said , " since you wish it . But I will return tomorrow . " With that he left . He took his horse and rode away . He had gone about a mile when he saw ahead of him another horseman , and even at the distance recognized the figure of Dr. Thomas . Dr. Thomas was riding at a slow walk , and in a little Jeremiahovertook him . After renewed greetings , they rode along side by side for a time without conversation . Dr. Thomas , a small man huddled in a big coat , with the skin of his brown old face wrinkled minutely like the skin of an apple that has been kept too long on the shelf , rode with his head bowed a little and his shoulders slumped . A little moisture hung at the tip of his nose , looking cold and ready to freeze there , and now and then he snuffled and twitched his nose , but he did not wipe it away . Finally Jeremiah asked him how the patient was . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She will die ? " " To all prospects , " Dr. Thomas replied . " You do what you can . I 've done what I know to do , like a man will . But you ca n't make somebody live . " " Make her live ? " " Not when she do n't want to , " the doctor said . " Sometimes when I give her medicine , she holds it in her mouth , and then when I turn she 'll spit it out . I 've seen it on the pillow . That was when she was stronger . Now I can get it down the old lady . But she do n't want to live , the old lady do n't . " Jeremiah found nothing to say to that . So they rode along in silence for another half mile , until they reached a fork . " I go this way , " the doctor said , and turned left . " Good day , sir , " he added , but did not seem to hear Jeremiah 's farewell. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old woman in the bed with her spying old eyes closed , and the stain of medicine on her pillow , dying because she did not want to live , and thought of Rachel wandering about the house , cold under the black shawl drawn tight about her shoulders , her face pale and not beautiful now . He thought of what she had told him , to go away while he could and never come back . That was what he thought of that night when he sat with Mr. Barronby the bright fire , and the old man sipped his drink and talked of how things had been long back , the good years and the bad years , and how he 'd wager on a good year this year to come , a good crop , for a good year was due now in the Lord 's will . " Speaking of that crop to come , " Jeremiah writes , " he straightened himself in his chair as though to rise and put his hand to business , and his old bleared eyes brightened like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good fruit of his labor and knows no regret for sweat spent . But I thought of that other old one , who longed for death , and I was sick at heart with the doubleness of life and with the thought how a man does not know on which path his foot is set . So without premeditation , I leaned at him and the words sprang from my lips without consideration of courtesy : But you are old , and you have made many crops , ' I said bitterly , and does it please you to make another ? Just like all the rest ? ' " He looked at me as though he thought me somewhat mad or as though I spoke Greek to him and him unlearned , and I waited for his reply . Then he slowly said , Son , I made me many a crop . Some good and some poor to starvation . But I aim , under God 's hand , to make me one more . ' He waited and took a sip from his glass , and then said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever made . ' " But what can it matter to you ? ' I demanded . This other crop ? You have prospered , you have land and rent , your sons have prospered , you are old , what can a crop matter now ? ' " Son , ' he said , having looked at me slow , you are learned , and in the wisdom of the dead tongues and in the law , and I am nigh unletteredbut for reading the Word and ciphering , and I can only say what come to me on the way . It come on me long back that all for a man like me was to set his strength to whatever come to his hand . I come a long way and through bad times and I have seen good men die , and in their strength . I have come over the mountains and in a new land full of wildness . I have done things would shame a man , in wrath and meanness of heart , and I have seen days I cried out against God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned I learned , and we taken this land and it is ours . ' At that the old man ceased , and drank , and looked into the good fire . Then he said : And son , I aim to make p 141me one more crop . It may be the best I ever made . Under God 's hand . ' " Jeremiah said no more , and shortly excused himself for bed . He lay and thought of the old woman dying because she hated life and had peered through crevices , and of the old man whose words he had just heard . He thought how old Thomas Bartlett Barron was certain of life and of death . For a moment , he himself felt that he had stumbled upon a bright secret , " as though you should kick up the dead leaves in your path and see the jewel glitter among that waste of the season , " and his heart was so full that he sat upright in his bed , in the cold room . But that did not last . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who could live by the day and the year , from crop to crop . What was another crop ? Nothing but taste for the mouth and warm glut in the belly , and the little steaming pile of morning excrement at last . He felt a terrible wrenching pity , and a tenderness as though he must protect the old man , at any cost , from a truth that might break on him any moment now like a flame to consume all his past life like a dead oak struck by lightning . Old Barron must live out the next month , the next year , and die without knowing . But he , Jeremiah Beaumont , knew , and knew that he was Jeremiah Beaumont , and only himself . With that thought , which was both " desolate and shot with joy , " he slept . The next afternoon , early , he rode to the Jordan place . Rachel receivedhim , without any reference to her words of the day before , how she had urged him to go away and never return . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she said , the night before . Mrs. Jordan had not changed . During the night , according to Josie , she had been wakeful and the fever had been high . Jeremiah and Rachel spent the afternoon together in the library . They talked scarcely at all . Two or three times Rachel excused herself to go up to the sick room . A young colored girl was watching there , for Old Josie was asleep . A little after dark came on , Jeremiah and Rachel had supper . They ate in the big dining room , by the light of a single candle , facing each other across the great width of dark , polished wood , not talking , eating the cold food . About nine o'clock , just as Jeremiah had made up his mind to leave , Josie appeared at the library door . Mrs. Jordan , she said , was in a " big sweat . " She had been sweating for some time , and the bed was soaked " past what any Christian could lay in . " Rachel rose and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the quarters to call Dellie to help . But Josie said that changing the sheets would p 142do no good , the mattress was all soaked , too . They would have to change the mattress and it would take somebody strong . In the instant when Rachel hesitated , Jeremiah said , " Let me help . I am strong . " Rachel looked at him , not speaking . Then Josie said : " Ai n't nuthin wrong with that , Missie . Ai n't nuthin but a pore old sick lady . " So Rachel nodded , and they went out into the hall , into the main hall , where a solitary candle burned , and up the stairs , into those regionswhere Jeremiah had never penetrated before . The bedroom was very large . A fair fire burned on the hearth and wood was stacked at one side . The fire gave more light than the candle on the shelf above . Across the room at one side , was a big tester bed , very high , beside it a table littered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of the old woman scarcely made a hump in the covers of the bed . Josie took charge . She ordered Jeremiah to step out into the hall while they changed the gown of the patient and moved her to the dry side of the bed . He waited outside , and presently Josie came out , carrying the candle , to conduct him to another room , where they stripped a bed and removed the mattress . Rachel came and held the candle while Jeremiah , with Josie 's help , brought back the mattress , and laid it across two chairs next to the bed . Then Josie turned to Jeremiah : " If you could pick her up . She ai n't nuthin but a pore old sick lady . " He nodded , then waited while Josie wrapped Mrs. Jordan in a blanket . He picked her up . She was very light , far lighter than he had expected . He carried her over to the fire , and waited with the form limp across his arms , the head half-propped on his right shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had peered at him and spied on him from the shadows , were closed . The game was over , the game of hunter-and-hunted . He had won , after all . He was the hunter , not the hunted . So , looking down into the face of the victim , he felt sorry for her , and the fancy touched his mind that she was not old Mrs. Jordan but any old woman , that she might even have been his own mother " come from the long past and far places to lie dying at last in the arms of a pious son . " Rachel said : " The bed is ready . " He placed her in the bed . He studied the face there on the pillow in the shadows . Then , with a shock , he discovered that the eyes in that face , under half-lowered lids , were watching him . The old game had begun again , he had not won , and fear , for an instant , seized him . The enemy was watching from an ambush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark hall had ever been , where she had hid , deeper and darker than the thicket or forest , and he  --  he , Jeremiah p 143Beaumont  --  was naked and defenseless in some open spot , like the settlerin his corn patch before the arrow twangs . Then he saw the lips move . What was horrible was that they made no sound , not even a whisper . It was , he thought , as though a statue tried to talk . Then the words came , but so faint and dry , like the slightest shift of dead leaves in a path in a movement of air , that he had to lean to be sure . " You "  --  she was saying  --  " you  --  I told you to go  --  to go ... " He leaned closer , trying to catch the words , and he felt Rachel 's fingers gripping his arm so hard that it hurt under the cloth . The old woman 's eyes were suddenly wide open , staring up at him . " Oh , what they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet and young  --  in Virginia  --  sweet and young , but , oh ... " He saw the wide eyes move in their sockets , fix on Rachel beyond him , then return to him. " .. . oh , she , she has killed me  --  and , oh  --  go away  --  before she  --  beforeshe kills you  --  she killed me and nobody cares and nobody loves me  --  nobody . . . He felt Rachel 's fingers gripping his arm. " . . . loves me  --  nobody loves  --  me . . . " He felt his own voice break from his throat . " I love you , " the voice said harshly , coming from his own throat . And without thinking , he leaned to kiss the old face , on the brow . He tasted the salt sweat on her skin and his nostrils were full of the stale , sour smell of her damp hair . He straightened up quickly , stifling the clutch of nausea in his vitals . Rachel 's fingers still gripped his arm . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed . He thought she was dead , and leaned again to see . The fingers had releasedhis arm , and he heard a movement as Rachel went across the room . The old woman was breathing . She seemed to be asleep , or again in her stupor . He turned , and saw Rachel crouched on the hearth , as close to the fire as she could get , clutching her hands together before the blaze . The light from the candle above fell on her hair , gilding it , but the light of the fire only defined the pallor of her face . Her shoulders were shaking as with a chill . He went to her , and bent to put a hand on her shoulder . She looked up at him , her stiff lips trembling . " I 'm cold , " she said . He took her hands , and began to chafe them for warmth . Then , at Josie 's knock , he straightened up . Josie came directly to Rachel . " Missie , Missie . . . " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Josie turned to Jeremiah . " Git her out , " she commanded . " You git p 144her out a-here . I 'll set up here . You git her out a-here . It ai n't doen her no good . " Then Josie took Rachel 's left hand and drew her to her feet , putting an arm about Rachel 's shoulder , murmuring and crooningto her , saying , " Baby  --  baby  --  baby . . . " That was the only word Jeremiah could distinguish . Josie led her to the door . Jeremiah followed . Josie , with an arm still about Rachel 's shoulder , reached to open the door . Then she turned to Jeremiah again . " You take her , " she commanded . " You take my Baby , and git her out a-here . " And she shoved Rachel toward him , delivering her over to him . He took Rachel 's hand , and led her out into the hall , which went almost dark as soon as Josie had shut the door . He led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library , and to the hearth , where the fire was low now . He released her to stir the embers and put on more wood . When he turned to her , she was standing as he had released her , but with her hands clutched together in the shawl . " I 'm cold , " Rachel said . " Come to the fire , come closer , " Jeremiah said . She did not move . So he took her hand and tried to draw her closer . She resisted him , not actively as by will , but as by a deadness and weight that seemed to fix her to the floor and make her sag . " Come , " he commanded softly , " come closer . " " Oh , " she breathed , and looked at him . " Oh , " she repeated , " oh , she said  --  she said I killed her . " " Hush , " he commanded . " She said I killed her  --  she said it . " " You did n't kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just an old woman dying . " " She said it  --  and , oh , I am wicked . " He took her in his arms . " You are not wicked , " he said . She surrendered to him for an instant , then stiffened . " Yes  --  yes , I am wicked . But "  --  and she tried to release herself , shoving against him  --  " but if I am wicked , she made me wicked , she made me . .. " " Hush , " he said , " hush , " trying to quiet her struggle. ... and if I killed her , she ruined me , she ruined me  --  for there 's nothing but ruin in this house , nothing but ruin  --  for nobody ever loved anybody in this house , not here , not here ... " He grasped her firmly . " I love you , " he said . " And in this house . " " No  --  no  --  nobody ever loved anybody here  --  and , oh , I am lost ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am lost ! " but heexerted his real strength and crushed her quiet . " You are not lost , " he said . " You are not lost , for I love you . Do you hear me ? I love you . And in this house . " " She leaned back from him in his arms , her hands against his chest . p 145But she was not struggling against him . She was staring intently into his face , as though she had just discovered it and had to learn it featureby feature . Then she lifted her hands , one on each side of his head , far back and tangled her fingers in his hair , and slowly drew his face toward hers . She kissed him full on the mouth . That night Jeremiah Beaumont had her , there in the library . From the moment their lips touched he knew it had come to pass . It was an act outside all his preconceptions and decisions . It was beyond any thought he had ever had . Some hours before dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even before she reached the library door and knocked . At the knock , their eyes met , and they knew the truth , but neither spoke . Then Rachel rose , went toward the door , and ordered Josie to come in . Mrs. Jordan , Josie said , was dead . She did not know when she had died . No , she herself had not been asleep . She had been wide awake , before the fire , and there had not been a sound . She had discovered the fact when she happened to go over to the bed . She must have been dead some little time , because by then the body was getting cold . Without a word or a look , Rachel went upstairs , leaving Jeremiah alone in the library . Mrs. Jordan was buried in the beech grove beside Timothy Jordan , upon whose picture she had spat , and not far from her nameless grandson . A Presbyterian preacher from Lumton , summoned by Jeremiah , performed the brief service . At the grave were Rachel and Jeremiah , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the occasion , the doctor and the preacher came back to the house and took a glass of whisky against the cold , and rode off together . A week later Jeremiah again went to Lumton , to the house of the preacher . He had been engaged to Miss Jordan for some time , he explained , but they had not intended to marry for months to come . But the death of Mrs. Jordan had changed everything . Sukie Marlowe , the midwife , who also served sometimes as a sort of nurse , had been stayingwith Miss Jordan . Miss Jordan had sustained a considerable shock with the death of her mother , and was now alone . Furthermore , the Jordan farm needed a man . Therefore , he and Miss Jordan had decided that , despite the recent death of her mother , they would be married . Would Brother Hillson ride to the Jordan house , on a day and hour of his election , to unite them , bringing such witness as the law demanded ? So they were married , on March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p 146JEREMIAH HAS TOLD US , ALMOST MOMENT by moment , how he approached his great resolve . He has not told in such detail how that resolve weakened and failed in his bosom . But it did weaken and fail . He slipped gradually and unwittingly into a new season or a new climate . The ball of his being , to use his own image , had tilted toward the sun and " fresh plants grew green in regions where there had been winter . " He moved into the Jordan house . Two days before his marriage he had told Mr. Barron that he would leave , and why . He had dreaded the moment , for he knew the kind of loneliness there would be for the old man after his departure , and felt , obscurely , that he was betraying an obligation . But he braced himself , and at night as they sat before the now smoldering fire , he told him . He need not have worried , for the old man said , " Boy , it is right and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no man say nay . There ai n't nothing like a woman by a man 's side , for dark and day , and trust betwixt them . " Jeremiah , in some embarrassment , spoke of his regret at leaving . " Good Lord , boy , " Mr. Barron stopped him . " I can take care of myself , and have . When my boys took off and my girls married away , I never peaked and pined . I cared for them and they cared for me , but 1 knew they had to go forth and lay hand on the world . For it is right . " He dropped into thought a moment , then added : " Do n't worry about p 147me . I got good niggers here . I done them right , and they done me right . Whatever I ask they do it , and before I ask them . " So that was easier than Jeremiah had expected . But it did not preparehim for what followed . The old man rose from the chair , knocked out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the far wall . He fumbled there a moment and then returned to the hearth . He had a silver mug in his hand . " My house was never much for vanity and such , " he said . " Plain and solid and the best the Lord would give for the strength of my arm . But my wife like a woman liked a pretty , and I wanted her to have them according to her good sense . When my girls left , I give them most . But I kept one or two to remember by . I kept this . " He exhibited the old mu polished bright in the candlelight . " I know , " he continued , Miss Jordan has got fine things from over the mountains , and wants for nothing . But you give her this . " He leaned and laid the mug in Jeremiah 's lap . Jeremiah looked down at the object , not touching it , and said , " No  --  no , I could not . I thank you from the heart . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old man urged . Jeremiah picked up the mug and held it out , shaking his head . The old man would not reach for it . He stood there on the hearth , grinning down through his whiskers . " It ai n't mine , " he said , " no more . It is Miss Jordan 's . And when she sets lip to it , you take joy in her . Like I did , long back , when Annie smiled acrost it . " The next day when he rode to the Jordan house , Jeremiah took the mug . When he gave it to Rachel she held it indifferently in her hand , scarcely glanced at it , and murmured perfunctory thanks . Then with an increasing sense of disappointment , he told her what the old man had said . At first he thought that she was not listening , for her face was somewhat averted . Then he saw that she was looking down at the mug and that tears coursed down her cheeks . " What is the matter ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is it ? " " Nothing  --  nothing  --  " she said , "  --  only . . " Only what ? " " Only  --  " and she rose abrupty , still clasping the mug . " What  --  " he began the question , but suddenly he knew what she had meant , and a cold clutch came at his heart . Then , all at once , he saw in his mind the face of the young girl smiling across the mug  --  a young girl with yellow hair and round cheeks and blue eyes  --  yes , the eyes would have been blue  --  and the lips parted above the silver rim to show the little white teeth set so even , as Tom Barron had seen them a lifetime ago when he stood in the budding growth beside the p 148trail in North Carolina and watched the girl yawn as she rode by on the fat , sleepy old pony , riding along on a Sunday morning behind her father and mother , going to the meeting house , and now the girl smiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meek and mischievous as though she belonged to him , to him , Jeremiah Beaumont , and not to Tom Barron , no , to Jeremiah Beaumont and invited him to take joy in her , in that innocence of an April morning long ago , long ago in North Carolina , and in that vision a wild despair swelled in Jeremiah , for why should he be deprived , why should Tom Barron have had that joy , Tom Barron who was a wheezing shapeless old man tied to a chair while Jeremiah Beaumont was young and strong ! He could have cried out with the anguish . But even at that instant he saw Rachel standing before him and heard her voice saying : " Only  --  only that you can never take such joy in me . " " No , " he heard his own voice saying , " no , I can not take that joy in you , " and saw the knuckles white with clutching the mug and saw the stricken face above . " No , " he repeated , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , but a leap and swoop of his being , mysterious and triumphant and abstract . " No , not that joy in you , " he said firmly , " but another , a greater joy , for  --  for . . . " He could not find the words . He felt the reality straining in him , but he could not find the words . He rose and stood before her . Then he said : "  --  for you have given me myself . " That night as he rode to the Barron place to spend his last night there , he thought of the episode . He could not understand now that moment of despair when the vision of Annie Barron had come to him smiling across the silver mug . What was she ? Nothing but some stupid backwoods girl with her round face and hair the color of straw . Well , young Tom Barron had loved her long ago and there was no quarrel with that if that was what Tom Barron had wanted , a good healthy girl to weave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children as easy as a cow in pasture . And old Thomas Bartlett Barron loved her now . He probably loved her more now than he ever had before , for now that she was dead and rotten at the foot ofcedar tree on the Bartlett farm she could be the memory that justified his life . Well , let her lie and be forgotten , and what joy Tom Barron had had in her , and he , Jeremiah Beaumont , would take his own joy in his own way . And he thought with pitying contempt of the simple joy to be had from Annie Barron . What would she know of the fullnessof life ? But " simple joy " came to surprise Jeremiah , too , in his new life with Rachel . " I would look upon her , " he writes , " as she sat by the hearthside at night after supper , with embroidery upon her lap , p 149or some other womanly task , and I would see the needle glint in the light and how subtle and sure were her fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common prettiness of female delicacy . Or when she read to me , as was her custom when I took my ease , I might note how the candlelight pricked out the secret gold or flame of her hair . I remember how upon my departure in the morning to go about the business of the day , she stood on the porch and looked after me and waved with a handkerchief , and especially once , when the day was gusty , how the wind pressed back her garments to define the secret sweetness of her form , which I knew well but which struck me then with such victorious newness that my heart stood still and my tongue clove dry to the roof of my mouth as though I had been Actaeoncome suddenly upon the naked goddess by the pool . Or how once in summer when I fell sick of a little fever for two days , she sat the whole of an afternoon by my bed , with no conversation , and I awoke from my drowse toward dusk and saw her face outlined black against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the fields . I made no stir but she knew and turned to me and held out a glass of water , saying , It is fresh , Jerry , and for you . ' " He had discovered what he calls " the bounty of common good which comes with no noise and does not rattle the latch upon the door . " But at first he approached the obligations of his new life with reluctance and a kind of half-hidden resentment . Plowing , sowing , and fence-mending seemed dreary and irrelevant before the violence of the passion which he and Rachel Jordan had found . And , at momentseven that passion faded before the consciousness of the great " Purpose , " the awful commitment he had made . Fort would come soon . And if Fort did not come , he , Jeremiah , would have to seek him out . So he was more ready now to ride to the settlement and wait for news at the tavern than to see to the roof of a barn or the depth of a furrow . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the greatness of life ? Grudgingly , then , he began to go about the farm . It did not take him long to see that the place had lacked a strong hand . TimothyJordan had been no farmer and no manager . There was slackness everywhere . Outbuildings unrepaired , land washed , fences down , cattlestraying , pastures gone to burdock , milkweed and nettle , brush coming back into good fields , idleness among the hands . Jeremiah thought how his own father would have sneered at the sight of such ruin of lands and goods . With a twinge of the heart he thought how if old Beaumont had come to this country with half of Timothy Jordan 's start , he would not have had to use his last strength to rise in the moment of death in the bitterness of his unfulfillment , and cry out , " No , by God , no ! " and then fall back upon the bankrupt'sp 150pillow . Old Beaumont would have been rich and great , greater than Colonel Mead or Timothy Jordan or Mr. Madison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Runnymede . Greater , by God , than Colonel Fort . Yes , greater than Colonel Fort . And sitting his horse , looking over the fields bare with winter and ruined by neglect , Jeremiah suddenly saw them covered with corn and oats and rich pasturage and fat cattle on the pasture . He felt the surge of energy in him which would make the vision real . Then he thought , " Is this my end , to be rich and easy , and heavy as my best sow glutted on oak mast ? " For the moment he was sick with self-loathing . Then he saw again his father 's swarthy face wearing the grim smile he used to smile when looking at a rich harvest , and he thought again how he , old Beaumont , would never have let a good field go to pieces or a fat pig stray , and how old Beaumont would have been great , given his chance , greater than Colonel Fort . Then Jeremiah saw the truth . He saw it clearly . He would make the vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Beaumont 's revenge on all the great whose company he had not been able to join . For old Beaumonthad a score to settle , too , just as Rachel Jordan had a score to settle . It was a score with Colonel Fort , one of the great to whom all things came easy , fat land and power and reputation among men and the white , ardent flesh of a young woman in a dark house . It all fell into order for Jeremiah Beaumont , his pleasure in his wife , his waiting at the tavern for news , his nocturnal brooding over his great purpose , and his daylight energy in the fields . And as the year wore on to harvest , his imagination began to leap into the future , beyond this harvest . He would buy some Merino sheep , the kind that Colonel Fort had introduced into this section . He would take out the timber on the creek for a new cornland and throw part of the old cornland to pasture to save it from wear and washing . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Sunday afternoon in August , he came upon the place for a mill . So the Merinos , the new cornland , and the mill entered his calculations and his dreams . He could see them before him . What else could he see before him ? He saw Rachel 's face waiting for him at the end of every day , speaking to him across the supper table , musing in the dusk as they walked in the garden , smiling up at him from a pillow , from the midst of her unbound hair , as he reached to snuff the candle . Did he still see Colonel Fort ? The solid bulk and sad face beyond the out-thrust pistol pointed at him , at Jeremiah Beaumont ? That body or his own lying on the ground by some ritual grove , with the 151patch of red growing on the breast ? He says this much : " I could not forget my obligation and my manhood , but circumstance taught me patience . " He had to be patient , for in the late spring Colonel Fort had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . He had gone as one of a committee of three to try to work out a system of postponement for debts owed in Kentucky to banks and merchants in those cities . Wilkie Barron had told Jeremiah that . For in June Wilkie was back at his uncle 's house on a visit , as a note brought by a colored boy on a mule informed Jeremiah one evening . The next day Jeremiah rode over to the Barron place . He found Wilkie prosperous and full of affairs . He was practicing law now in Lexington under the wing of Mr. Madison , writing articles for Skrogg 's Advocate , speechifying for Relief , consorting with the great , whose names now came easily to his tongue . He was a little heavier than before , but still lithe in carriage and quick in movement . Ills glistening boots creaked " elegantly " ( Jeremiah gives us the word ) as he paced old Barron 's veranda and gestured with his cigar and expatiated on the wickedness and defect of public spirit and ignoranceof law just exhibited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May 13 , 1822 . A certain Blair , Wilkie explained , had owed one Williams $219.67 ; 2 . Wilkie dwelt on the half cent . The year before , in 1822 , in the August term of the Bourbon County Circuit Court , Williams had received judgment against Blair for the debt and costs . Immediately , according to the replevin law of December 25 , 1820 , duly passed by the Legislature of the Commonwealth of Kentucky , Blair had gained relief by a replevin bond for two years . But in November Williams had moved to quash the replevin bond and collect . On May 13 , Judge Clark had given a decision in favor of the creditor Williams , declaringthat the replevin law of Kentucky was void . He had cited Section X of Article I of the United States Constitution which forbade the passing of any ex post facto law or any law breaching the obligation of contract , and had then declared that Section XVIII of Article X of the Kentucky Constitution was in full agreement . If Judge Clark 's decision stood , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wilkie declared . By God , it could not . " It is the law , " Jeremiah said . " I remember the Article in the KentuckyConstitution . " " We could change it , " Wilkie declared . " For what is our constitutionfor ? It is to protect the people of the state . And when it does not protect , it is not valid . We will change it . " Jeremiah pointed out that the Constitution of the United States would remain . p 152 " Remain ! " Wilkie exclaimed . " It will remain where it belongs . On a scrap of sheep 's hide in Washington . But not here . For this Commonwealthhas its dignity and shall make its own law and its people shall not starve . " He teetered on the edge of the veranda and gestured with his cigar . He seemed not to be speaking so much to Jeremiah as to the empty space of the yard , which might be full of people , people waitingand listening to Wilkie Barron . Then he swung to Jeremiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seen beggary on the streets of Lexington . I have seen men hungry on the road as I came here . And we 'll make the law we need . " " The law is . . . " Jeremiah began . But Wilkie cut him short with a gesture of authority . " Law me no law , sir , " Wilkie said , " and split me no hairs , sir . Law is to maintain the right . And when it does not do so ... " Wilkie 's voice went on , saying things that Jeremiah did not hear , for he was thinking how what Wilkie had just said echoed his own thoughts in those first days after Rachel had laid the obligation upon him . He had then asked himself where was the voice of Justice but in the heart . But what had Wilkie said ? He had said : " Where is the voice of Justice but in the belly ? " That was what Wilkie had said , all he had said , though in finer words . That was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a wicked parody , and he almost started up from his chair in anger like a man who is mocked . But his friend had not mocked him . His friend was a thousand miles away , talking politics , how this was in confidence but there would be a special session of the Legislature and how the Legislature would assert its sovereign power against Judge Clark and against any man , however great in wealth and place , who stood in the way of Relief . Even against Henry Clay who was turning traitor to the people of Kentucky and to Justice . " For we only want justice , " Wilkie was saying . " For that is all a man can live by . " Justice , Jeremiah thought , justice . Justice of the belly . And , by God , justice of the heart . He rose abruptly from his chair . " You are right , " he said . " Ah , " Wilkie said , and looked curiously at him . " Ah , you believe me ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his shoulder . " That day at Lumton  --  you remember , Jerry ? " Jeremiah made no answer , feeling a faint resentment . " Well , " Wilkie said , and his hand clenched on the shoulder , you will stand by us again . " Jeremiah tells us that his sudden confusion of spirit must have p 153showed in his face , even though he said nothing , for Wilkie grasped his shoulder harder , driving his fingers in , and leaned at him , and said , " If you see the right , if you know we are right , and sit still and do nothing  --  then  --  then you .. . " Wilkie 's smooth , brown , handsome face was thrust at him , the dark eyes glittering , the lip curling under the dark mustache to show the even teeth , and it was suddenly strange to Jeremiah , like a face he had never seen before , strange and threatening , and he whiffed the cigar-rich breath that blew out of the curling mouth , over the even teeth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , then recoiled . But Wilkie was laughing . It was the old , gay , bantering laugh of the days in Bowling Green . He released Jeremiah 's shoulder , lifted his hand , and slapped the shoulder with all the warmth in the world . " Oh , you 're the bridegroom ! " he exclaimed . " And what 's the use of talking politics to a bridegroom ? Why , damnation , the only politics a bridegroom is concerned with is the politics of the bedchamber . And , oh , the bridegroom  --  he 'll carry his point . Oh , he 'll fight for relief ! " Wilkie seemed very pleased with his joke . Again , he slapped Jeremiahon the shoulder , laughing , saying , " Damn it , do n't look so doleful . I know I blaspheme against pure love . " Then Wilkie was serious . " Jerry , " he said , " I know you are happy . Enjoy your happiness , and may it last forever . But , my boy , when the first blush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . " Jeremiah said nothing . " Oh , you will find that you live in the world . And then  --  and then , Jerry : .. " " Then , what ? " Jeremiah demanded , vehemently , almost angrily . " Then you . can join us . Shoulder to shoulder . But now , my boy , I would not disturb your happiness for worlds . But one thing , may I come and see you in your happiness ? " Jeremiah felt the sudden impulse to say , " No  --  no  --  you can not come  --  nobody can come  --  and least of all , you . " But with the impulse , came the guilt of the impulse . So he said : " You must come . We expect you . Will you come tomorrow ? Rachel wants to see you . She told me to ask you . She is very anxious to see you . ... " The lies poured out , and each lie , as he became aware that it was a lie , demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said nothing , and Rachel would be waiting for him only , for Jeremiah Beaumont only , under the trees on the lawn , in the long summer twilight . Wilkie cut short the lies . " I ca n't come tomorrow , " he said . " I have letters , urgent letters . Or the next day . But soon . When you come to p 154me again , we 'll fix a time . For I must see your happiness . " He stopped , shook his head ruefully , and smiled with a sadness half-comic and half-serious , and said , " For you see , Jerry , I have found no happiness . I must see your happiness to keep my faith in happiness . " " You must come ! " Jeremiah burst out , and for the first time that day discovered the old warmth and affection . " Drop the letters , and come tomorrow ! " " Not tomorrow , " Wilkie said , shaking his head . " Soon ! " Jeremiah exclaimed . " Soon , " Wilkie agreed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mount . It was the instant just after the farewells had been passed , and Jeremiah'sfoot was already in the stirrup , and his back to his friend as he made ready to swing up to the saddle . Then he heard Wilkie 's voice , very low , saying , " Now that you are happy , Jerry , are you ready to . . . ? " Foot still in the stirrup , Jeremiah looked over his right shoulder . " Ready to what ? " he demanded . Wilkie was standing close , with a cigar in his mouth , his whole face " looking dark and closed like the outside of a shuttered house , " studying Jeremiah from under half-lowered lids . " Ready to what ? " Jeremiah again asked . Wilkie removed the cigar , tapped off the ash , and replied quite casually , " Ready to drop that old affair ? That fool business ? " Jeremiah abruptly turned his head from Wilkie , swung to the saddle , uttered , " No , by God ! " and gave his mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could he be angry with Wilkie ? For Wilkie only spoke with the tongue of the wise world . For Wilkie only wished his happiness . For Wilkie only spoke as his friend . But he was angry with himself . Angry because he had so far forgot himself and what made him himself that he had to depend on some casual word to remind him of what he was . He drove the spurs in again , savagely , as though he drove them into his own flanks . It was so easy to forget . That night , as he lay in the dark , after the act of love , he said to his wife that it was easy to forget , in the midst of happiness , the price of happiness . To this she gave some drowsy response , which made him think she had not heard . He rose on an elbow , and tried to peer at her . " Did you understand ? " he asked . " You said you are happy , " she replied . And added , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then she reached out and laid her hand on his . But he did not respond to her touch . " Listen , " he said . " I said it p 155is easy to forget the price of happiness . But you must not think I have forgotten . " " Forgotten ? " she echoed , and made some slight stir in the dark . " My God , " he exclaimed , " how could you forget ? " " What ? What ? " the voice asked , slightly edged with alarm . " Fort ! " he said . " By God , Colonel Cassius Fort . And do you remember who he is ? " There was no answer , but he heard the intake of her breath . " I 'll tell you who he is , " he said . " He is the man who laid his foul hands on you . " He reached out and laid his own hand on her breast . " And have you forgotten ? " he repeated , and jerked his hand back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying , " Have you forgotten ? What you swore me to ? " There was no sound from the bed , and for an instant he had the wild fear , as he tells us , that there was nobody there , nothing there in the dark , but himself . And that fear made him increase the violence of his words . " Have you forgotten ? Answer me ! " Then she answered . " No , " the voice said dully from the dark , " no . " " Good , " he said . And : " Good . There speaks my wife . For you  --  you would not "  --  he leaned toward the darkness where she lay  --  " for after what he did , you would not let it be said he breathed and lived . To your shame . To my shame . " " Oh , do it , " her voice said , but it was like a wail , " do it  --  and the quicker the better  --  but for God 's sake , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ! Now or ever ! " He was about to reply , he did not know exactly what , but something in anger to the effect that he would speak of it for it was their dearest bond . But he heard her body shift in the bed , and heard her gasp , and knew that she had buried her head in the bolster to stifle the sound of weeping . At that , he felt desolate and abandoned , and though the night was hot , he shivered nakedly as he stood there breathing in the darkness of the room . Somewhat later he crept into bed . He lay there a long time before sleeping . He did not understand himself , he admits  --  his fury or his fear which had come to surprise him . Nor did he understand her . He could not imagine how it would be tomorrow , in daylight , when they had to face each other across the breach made in the darkness . But at last he slept , and when he woke in the morning , she smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kiss it in the palm as though she were giving him a present for him to close his fingers upon and hold . So it was a day like any other day . The summer passed . In August , when the crop was laid by , the 156usual season for a slacking off of work , Jeremiah took his Negroes to a spot on the creek he had located for a mill and began to work on taking out stone for a dam and for the race and foundations . He would be ready when good times came back to the country . Good times would come back . For one thing , as Wilkie had predicted , the Legislature had met in special session and had resolved that Judge James Clark 's decision was in contravention of the laws of the Commonwealth , and had appointed a committee to report on his conduct . The committee had reported back that Clark 's opinion was subversiveof the best interest of the people and shook public confidence in the institutions of government , and Clark had been summoned to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped removal , the Relief sentiment had still been so strong that the necessarytwo-thirds majority had almost been reached and with the next election there was every promise that Relief would have control of the government . Meanwhile , Jeremiah 's own crop was good . Even with the low prices he would make out . But in addition to that satisfaction , he had had the satisfaction of seeing men stop by the edge of his fields to admire his corn . He felt that he had earned that  --  " the good opinion of honest and laborious men . " He relished it , too , at the tavern at the crossroads . When he had first begun to go there , he had gone only for news of Colonel Fort 's movements , and in his obsession the faces of the men he had listened to had been as meaningless as ghosts . But now , in the fall and winter of 1822 , he no longer went there for news . Fort was back in Washington , and a nephew of Mrs. Fort ran the place here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tavern now it was for the pleasure that the society there could give . The faces were real now , and the words he heard had meaning . He had the habit of sitting quietly with his whisky ( though in that whisky-soaked society he was not much given to drink ) , and listening to the talk and the arguments . For a long time he took no part . He was not of that world . His world was back at the Jordan house where Rachel waited . But as he sat here , he drew some warmth and strength from the good humor , the brags , and the turbulence of the world beyond him . Bit by bit , however , he was drawn into it . A man would offer him a drink , and boast of a horse or a cock or a dog , tell some wild tale and slap Jeremiah 's shoulder and roar with laughter , or curse the weather and the government . Or in some wrangling argument they would appeal to him , for they knew him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " p 157He was prevailed upon , too , to go on a hunt in the fall , in the rougher country to the west , where he saw beautiful untouched valleys . He hunted for a week , in the old way , gorging by the fire at night , washing the hot meat down with whisky , lying on a bear skin after the meal and looking at the stars . Late at night , when the others were asleep , he recaptured now and then something of the wild joy of his boyhood , when he had gone on his first hunt and had lain in the dark and " longed to stay forever alone in the free forest , killing and feasting on the beasts . " But he knew he would go back , back to Rachel , and the " sweet melancholy of boyhood thought was lost in the peace of manhood 's certainty . " " He went back , back to Rachel , to his work and projects , to his occasional visit at the tavern , to his pleasure in the respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his interest in their talk of the world he touched but did not quite belong to . And in that world that winter the passion increased . The United States District Court had declared the replevin laws of Kentucky contrary to the Constitution of the nation . Wherever the news came it touched off pride and fury . " Shall good men starve now in Kentucky , " Skrogg wrote in his Advocate , " because sniveling lawyers and the puffed-up rich once wrote down words in a constitution and gave them out to be the voice of God ? " And Skrogg 's words let blood and broke bones on the streets of Lexington and Frankfort , and in country taverns and crossroads stores . The sheriff 's writ and the pinch of the belly were here and now . The violence , like a tide , washed into the farthest county seat or settlementtavern to release new violence to flood back oar the big towns where the great men debated and the rich gave themselves airs and the banker totted up accounts and calculated interest and the fanatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , printed on handbills or broadsides or in newspapers , or passed from mouth to mouth , spread over the land to bring blood . This violence washed in and out of Tupper 's Tavern , where Jeremiah sat for his ease . Jeremiah watched the tide lap and swirl at his feet . He did not allow himself to be drawn into arguments or discussion . He was quiet , listening , and if he was addressed or questioned , his courtesy saved him . " For I had never made it a practice , " he writes , " to state myself combatively or to insist upon my opinion . I had been spared that vanity , and most of all during that time , when I was saddened to see the waste of manhood and the ruin of prospects wrought by the idle or desperate word , though that word sprang from just grievance . " But it was a dangerous game he played . And it became more dangerous as the supreme court of the Commonwealth , the Kentucky Court of Appeals , considered the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after judge Clark 's adverse decision in the Circuit Court . If Chief Justice John Boyle and his associates Owsley and Mills should rule against the law made by the Legislature of the Commonwealth , they would be nothing less than dividers of the public heart , setters of brother against brother , traitors . But how could John Boyle fail to see the truth , men asked . He had been born in poverty and knew the pinch . He had been brought as a child into Kentucky , in the early days , back in 1782 , when men were men to seize the wildernessor died . He was of the blood that had made Kentucky , and would not undo her . No , others said . John Boyle had consorted too long with the great . Prosperity had shriveled his heart like a green gourd plucked and left in the sun . He was the hireling of place and the fugelman of power , and justice Owsley was his creature . For young Owsley had studied law with Boyle and was his tool . Make no mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were .. . There was the broadside : TO ALL MEN OF KENTUCKY ! ! WAKE AND WATCH AND SLEEP NOT ! ! WHEN THE COURT SHALL SPEAKHAVE YOUR ANSWERREADY ! ! ! Should John Boyle deny his kind , should he forget the gnaw of the belly empty and the brotherhood of the poor , should he take pride in setting lip to the silver cup , should he break faith and foul his sacred oath as the guardian of our good , should he tyrannize over Owsley and Mills , his sworn fellowsThen  --  Oh , then  --  ye men of Kentucky , son of the canebrake or child of the hill , you know the answer and you know the way ! Remember how this fair land was ransomed and not without blood . It was the blood of our fathers . Will you be worthy of that blood ? WHAT SHOULD BE DONEWITH A TRAITOR ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ? ? ? ? ? The broadside , unsigned , hung on the wall of Tupper 's Tavern . It was a late afternoon , in March , 1823 . Jeremiah was in his corner , near the hearth , where a little fire smoldered . Then Squire McFerson came in . That event was unusual , unusual enough to break the interest of the group by the broadside and turn their eyes upon him . For the Squire was deep in his years now , gouty and wheezing and heavy , scarcely able to mount and come to a burgoo p 159or a horse-run or the tavern for the good fellowship he had once loved a little too well for his constitution or estate . His broadcloth was frayed now and his eyes bleared , the color of his red face and hair , and " hearty good will had long since given way to irascibility and despite . " The Squire stumped over to the group by the wall , muttering , " What ha ' ye here , what ha ' ye here ? " The group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wall , peering at the broadside with his bad sight . Then he swung round at the men . " What blackguard hung this treason here ? " he demanded , and struck the floor with his stick . There was no answer . So he again struck the floor , and shouted , " Let him speak if he is no coward ! " In the silence , there was no sound , except the measured tap of Mr. Tupper 's pipe as he knocked the ash out against the stone of the hearth . Then he rose . He was a small man but broad-shouldered , and he carried his head back with glaring eyes like a game-cock . He was the master of a snug little brick tavern , he knew the arts of the tavernkeeperin that world , long forbearance , measure and civility , then upon necessity the stroke like lightning . He was , for all his small stature and soft voice , a " tight little fistful of man-meanness by commonreport " He stood upon his own hearth , with his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No blackguard hung it there , sir . " " None but a blackguard , " the Squire said . " I hung it there , " Mr. Tupper said calmly , " and recommend you watch your words , sir . " " None but a blackguard , " the Squire repeated . Then added : " And - a traitor , to boot . " Mr. Tupper rocked on his heels on the hearth , like a man at ease . Then he said : " We have been good friends and neighbors , Squire , for many a year , but if you were not wind-broke with time and swole with dropsy , I 'd knock out your last tooth for half of those words . " The Squire was inflamed purple , and for a moment could not speak . Then he uttered something more like a rumble in the throat than like words and advanced a few ponderous steps toward the hearth . Then he stopped , mastered his rage , and said , " I 'll fight ye . I 'll fight ye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Tavern-master , " Mr. Tupper said , " and I made the tavern with my own hands and my own sweat , and it is mine , and I 'll have in it no pus-gutted nigh-bankrupt old waster who better than rail at true words should thank God for Relief to save him a bit of bread for his last days . " Then the old man reached into his coat and drew out a dirk and said , " I 'll fight ye no duel , I 'll kill ye now ! " p 160Mr . Tupper kept his hands clasped behind him . But there was a big iron poker propped on the hearth , not three feet from him . " I warn you , " he said . " This is my house and I have been named blackguardand not lifted a hand , as I call for witness . But if you do not put up that toy ... " " Toy ! " the old man bellowed , and came lurching at Mr. Tupper . Jeremiah leaped from his chair and seized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then grappled with his free arm , and they swayed together . Jeremiah was surprised at the Squire 's great strength , as he almost tore free . At that instant , Jeremiah was aware that the poker had swung into the air . He heaved his weight to one side , stumbled and almost fell . But he jerked old McFerson down on one knee . The strength was out of McFerson . He was nothing now but a great mass of sagging flesh . His puffed face was red and slick with sweat , his eyes stared wide and blank , and his mouth was open for the painful , rasping gasps . Jeremiah still clung to the right arm . But all at once , the fingers of the hand relaxed , and the dirk fell to the floor . The poker still hung in the air above them . Jeremiah looked up into Mr. Tupper 's face which , streaked white and with glaring eyes , hung there between the uplifted arms holding the poker like an ax . " In God 's name ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the air , " do n't do it ! " " Would you threaten me ? " Mr. Tupper demanded , staring down at Jeremiah now . But he let the poker slowly down to one side as though reluctant to forgo the blow . The weight of McFerson sagged against Jeremiah , as the knee that had supported it gave way . Jeremiah barely braced himself to keep the body from slipping to the floor , getting his left arm around the thick shoulder . The heavy old head rolled back on Jeremiah 's shoulder , with the weak surrender of a child or a sick man . But the old man was saying , " You  --  you  --  get your hands  --  off me . . . " Jeremiah could not release him . If he released him , he would fall back on the floor . But even as the old man let his head lie cradled on Jeremiah 's shoulder , he was saying , " Get them off  --  for you  --  you 're a blackguard  --  too  --  a blackguard . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell him . " To save you . To save you from something you would regret . " Then Jeremiah saw that tears were coming out of the popping , inflamed eyes and running down the puffed cheeks . " I am old  --  an old man . . . " Then Mr. Tupper spoke , " Sir , Mr. Beaumont . . . " Jeremiah looked up to see him leaning on the poker as on a cane p 161and regarding the body . " Will you kindly get him out ? " Mr. Tupper said . " I want no such filth on my floor . " " My God , " Jeremiah said , " ca n't you see  --  ca n't you see ? " And to the loathing he had for that weight in his arms there was the new loathing for the face above . " I am an old man  --  an old man ... " McFerson was saying with his gasps . " Get him off my floor , " Mr. Tupper commanded . " My God , " Jeremiah began , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Jeremiah scrambled up , too , getting the old man 's arm on his shoulder to sustain him . They half-carried , half-dragged the body to the door , for the legs were no good , making feeble motions but supporting no weight . But just outside the door , the old man seemed to rally his strength for an instant to stand . He looked Jeremiah in the face , and said in a stronger voice , almost like his old voice , " Get your hands off me  --  you blackguard . " Jeremiah stepped back . He felt the urge to explain , to justify himself , but then he looked straight into the red , puffed face with its gaping , wheezing mouth , and the inflamed eyes that stared straight into his own , and he discovered the nakedness of hate . There was nothing he could ever explain to that face . So he turned to one of the men . " Get him to a house , " he said . " To that house . " And he pointed to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch them go , but turned to re-enter the tavern . He would get his hat and go . He had to get away from the place . There was a babble of voices in the big room , but as he entered the sound stopped . He found all the eyes on him . He felt stripped and defenseless , accused of some nameless crime . He moved toward the hearth , where his hat lay on the bench , and the eyes followed him . " And how 's the old fool ? " one man demanded . And another : " You should have let him come on , the pride-swole old gobbler . " And Mr. Tupper , leaning on the poker : " And if he had come ... And another voice : " . . . and one Anti-Reliefer the less . " And another : " The son-of-a-bitch of an Anti-Reliefer . " And Jeremiah found himself saying patiently , trying to explain something : " He is just an old man , he is just an old man . " " An old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll come no more to my house . " " One of the men had in his hand the broadside which Squire McFersonhad snatched from the wall . He held it out toward Jeremiah , shakingit a little as to emphasize what he was about to say . " And how do you stand on this , Mr. Beaumont ? " the man demanded. p 162He hated them all , the nasty , vain old bankrupt Scot who would stab one moment and weep like a baby the next , the glare-eyed little tavern-master who leaned on the poker like a victor , the man who held out the broadside in his work-hard hand and was again demanding , " And how do you stand on this ? " He wanted to say , was about to say , " My opinions are my own affair , " but the eyes on him forbade that . They would never be satisfied . " Yeah , " a man said , " and how do you stand ? " " Listen , " Jeremiah said , " the Court has given no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and . . . " I know what it had better decide ! " the man with the broadside said , and shook the paper in his hand . " It 's our Court , " another cut in , " and it better decide what we want or . . . " We do not know what the Court will decide , " Jeremiah repeated firmly , " and it is unjust to prejudge its decision . Furthermore , a Court that can be threatened is no Court . Law by threat is not law , and if " Law ! " one of the men said , and turned and spat on the hearth . " Yes , law , " Jeremiah said again . " Law by threat is not law , and if I were a judge and threat were made ... " " Yeah , Mr. Beaumont , " a voice said , " and what would you do and you a judge ? " " One thing , if I had the strength . I should try to ignore the threat and act by my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and oath ! " the man with the broadside exclaimed . " The oath is to defend the people , and , by God . . " " And to defend the law ! " Jeremiah interrupted , " To defend the people by law and have justice by law ... " A big , tall , gangling man who had not spoken  --  a man like men you saw on the road or lounging in front of a cabin , hairy-faced , wearing homespun and stitched-down shoes , bent in the shoulders , rawhanded  --  steppedforward and looked straight and slow into Jeremiah 's face . " Mister , " he said , " mister , you mean you air Anti-Reliefer ? " " I am for Relief , " Jeremiah began , " but . . " " But , " the man echoed , " but .. . " " Yeah , he 's for Relief , " a nasty voice said , " but .. . " " But he do n't need no relief , " the gangling man said . Then direct to Jeremiah : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine place ... " Then a voice to the rear , the voice of Simpson , a farmer : " Mr. Beaumonthas spoke sense . I 'm Relief , but to threaten the Court beforehandis to . . . " And the eyes swung to him . All but the eyes of the gangling man . And he was saying to Jere- p 163miah leaning at him and squinching his gaze directly into Jeremiah 's face : " Oh , yeah , you  --  you was smart to get you a fine place  --  you knowed how to get you one  --  oh , you knowed , all right ... " Jeremiah never understood exactly why he did not leap upon the man . For the man 's words cut him off from what he had taken to be the central fact of his life , from Rachel Jordan , Rachel Beaumont , his wife , and from all she was to him . But at the same instant that the meaning of the words penetrated to him and inflamed him to rage , they paralyzed him . For the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but of all the faces , of faces everywhere , over the country , faces leaning at each other leering and winking , saying , " Yeah  --  yeah  --  he knowed  --  he knowed , all right  --  oh , he was a smart one . " So Jeremiah averted his face , feeling the flush of shame . Shame for what ? He described the moment : " I was shamed for the weakness that would not let me lift a finger to defend what I knew to be the truth of my actions . But perhaps I was shamed by a deeper shame which it is hard to put into words even now , though I have thought much upon it . If a man lives by what he feels to be the truth in him , and discovers in a single instant that the tongue of the world says differentlyof him , there comes the fear and shame that what he had held to be the truth in him may not be the truth after all and there may be no truth for him but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . And if a man is robbed of his truth , and of a sudden , how can he know what he is ? " So I was weak to turn my face , and even weaker to be grateful that none had heard the words of insult addressed to me . For if others had heard , I could not be sure whether even then I might have had strength of manhood . At least I was spared the public shame , for the debate had become general and voices were raised . I took my hat and went toward the door with what dignity is left a man shaken to the marrow of his bones . " At the door I turned , and tried to save something of my respect , by saying in a voice loud and firm enough to catch the attention that f had spoken my honest opinion and would abide it , and they all looked at me for a moment . And I noticed , even as I spoke , that the tall man whose name I did not know and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mean and sardonic pleasure as though he had surprised a secret to my disgrace . " Jeremiah rode homeward in great distress . He had been appalled by the irrational violence which had involved him . He had tried to save a life and had earned the name of blackguard for his pains . He had tried to speak for reason and justice , and had been told that hisp 164whole life was based on the foulest and most prideless self-interest . The injustice done to him smarted like wounds . He met a man on the road , and to the man 's good day muttered something without looking him in the face . He wondered was the man thinking , " There goes that Beaumont  --  that fellow who married a castofftrollop because she was rich . " Having passed , he had the crazy impulse to turn and pursue and drag the man from his saddle and strangle him and toss the body into a ditch . But the man was n't the world . You could not strangle the whole world . But there was Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would clear him . It would clear him before the world . It would clear him before himself . He would bathe in it and be clean , and the words of the hymn ran through his head , of a fountain filled with blood which would wash away all guilty stains . He was so preoccupied when he came into his house that he scarcely acknowledged his wife 's greeting , and turned coldly from her kiss . At supper he answered shortly some word she said , and then waited with a cold pleasure for some bitter retort from her . But she made none . She had never spoken to him in anger , but now he longed for such a word from her . She only looked down at her plate , however , white in the face . He saw how the freckles stood out on the white skin , and how the brown mark was suddenly bold on the left cheek . He thought quite coldly how it was a blemish , and wished it were away . He could not conceive now how once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose from the table before the meal was over , and went to walk in the yard alone . She did not come out to him . He did not re-enter the house until he saw the light go out in the window of the room they shared . Lying beside her in the dark , wondering if she was awake , listening for her breath , he felt a terrible remorse , mixed with self-pity . He had been driven to what he had done . It was not his fault . They were victims together . He experienced a surge of his old tenderness for her . He would defend her against all the world . Then the question struck him , did she share the view of the world ? Did somewhere , in the unspoken depth of her mind , lurk the notion that he had come to her for her lands ? He had the idea to seize her and wake her and demand the truth , and he actually rose in the bed . But he knew it would do no good to ask . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her that it was not true , that she wronged him . Ah , there was a way . He would take her and go away , somewhere west , to a new place , a new country , new faces , new names , even he and she with new names . They p 165would go away with nothing , nothing but the clothes on their backs , leaving the land and the house and the stock and the lands for whoeverwould take them . Ah , that would prove to her that he had come innocently and in honor , that he wanted nothing . As she suffered cold and hunger and the wildness of a new country , she would know him for what he was . Cold and hunger would be a punishment to her for foul suspicion , he thought grimly . Oh , she was gently bred , and she would suffer . As his mother had suffered , who was gently bred . As all those women , all kinds of women , the gentle and the common had suffered who had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't she suffer ? She was no better than they . But as he relished the picture of her just punishment , he was ashamed of his satisfaction . How did he know that she had ever held that suspicion of him ? Why should she suffer ? Then he felt like crying out , " And why should I suffer  --  I who am guiltless ? " But was he guiltless ? Was not his suffering the punishment for harboring a suspicionagainst himself ? If he had been clear before himself , would the suspicion of the world have mattered ? But could you know ? Could you know ? Was there a way to know ? There was a way . There was Fort . That was the old circle . Whatever happened , whatever road he took , the circle always closed where it began . There was Fort . There was the perfect act , outside the world , pure and untarnished . Outsidethe world , the beginning and the end , the perfect justice selfdefiningand since defining self , defining all else . Then , clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in full voice in the dark above him , he heard his own voice as it had spoken that afternoon at the tavern when he looked into the hairy face of the man who held out the broadside . It had said , and said again , now in the dark : " To defend the people and have justice by law . " And the voice said again and again in the dark : " Justice by law . " And it was his voice snatched out of him that afternoon by all the witless violence he had just been caught in . And to strike Fort down would not be justice by law . So he began again the old track , treading the old circle , step by step , trying the footing in the dark , fearful that it would give beneath his weight , feeling the quiver of earth beneath each step . But toward dawn , the circle closed where it began , and he slept . The next day the idea came for a project that would forever stop any mouth from saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman for her lands and lives on them easy . " He would have lands of his own . There were still lands in Kentucky , where men would come . On the hunt in the fall he had seen valleys full of strong timber and p 166glades where the grass was waist-high and juicy , soil that would slice to the plow like cheese to the knife and so rich that a grain of corn would explode in it like powder in the chamber of a rifle . There were streams for mills and stone for building . It was waiting for the taking , and a strong hand . And now was the time to take , when times were bad and men made no projects . He would take now , and when things changed , when the settlement began to expand again and men put their minds again on the future and the West , he would be rich . He wrote to Bowling Green and got a manual of surveying , and every night , no matter how strenuous the day had been , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes till long past midnight , till the candle guttered and the first rooster crowed back by the barn . Then he would go upstairs , strip in the dark , and let himself down by Rachel 's side to seize a little rest before the horn . He did not tell her what he was doing . He would show her . He would show the world . Nothing could stop him . He did not want lands and cattle and money to be happy , but you had to show the world in the world 's way . And , one night , sitting late by the candle , thinking that , he suddenly remembered his father . " I thought how he had come to the new land with a book on surveying and must have studied it in those hard years before my birth , in a cabin , late at night , by the light of a grease lamp , as I now by a sperm candle set in a silver stick . I thought how in my boyhood I had found the worn copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelf and how my father had come upon me reading it , and had gone black in the face with his anger and had seized it from me , and how later he had left it for me on my bed . Then at once my eyes swam with tears I could not shed , for I knew my father and the bitterness that had struck him when he saw me , a boy , with the old book which was the mark of his hope deferred and brought low , and I knew the nature of that hope , not for lands and wealth , but to show his manhoodin the world in the way the world would understand , for a man must find a way to be a man . And I knew the great bitterness in him at his moment of bankrupt death when he strove to rise and struck the bolster and cried out , No , by God , no , ' meaning to say that he would not be deprived . So in pity and solemnness in a rich house I had not earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been the very same old tattered book on surveying he had left on my bed for apologyand in his contrition as a gift for me . With that , I straightened in my chair and put aside fatigue and set anew to my labor , though the hour was late . " As soon as the crop was in , Jeremiah made a trip to Frankfort to study plats of Kentucky land and to learn there what he could of movement to the west . Then almost immediately upon his return , p 167he set out west , taking with him one of his slaves and a strong intelligentwhite boy , who had had some schooling , the son of a neighbor . He was spying out the land , trying to locate for his first venture in speculation . He was gone longer than anticipated , and upon his return he found signs of bad season and slackness on the farm . So for the next week he was absorbed in trying to repair the damage of his absence . He did , however , have the evenings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the late afternoon , he felt a clean lift of the heart , like something glimpsed on the horizon as you top the brow of a hill , the flash of water , the soar of a hawk . He would soon be sitting with her in the garden , in the arbor , in the evening , while the fireflies pricked the deepening dusk over the yard and pastures . He would sit with her , without any conversation . There would be no need for that . He would hold her hand , and she would lean lightly against his shoulder . He would be aware of the faint stir of her breath , less than sound , less than motion , simply part of the throbbing , brimmingfullness of the world as dark came on . But one evening , she said : " When you were away I missed you so I thought how I could not live without you . " He did not answer , but his own thoughts turned to his loneliness on the trip , and he pressed her hand for response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I understand , " he said . " No , " she said , " no , you do n't understand . " " I do , " he said , and almost began to tell her of lying in the camp , night after night , feeling empty and lost , listening to the boy breathe and the man snore , thinking how they could plunge into sleep as into happiness at the end of the day 's labor , envying them because he could not , because he was somehow cut off from that perfect world of effort and repose , because he was alone without Rachel . But she said again , " No , no , " and there stirred faintly in him a resentment which forbade him to speak . If she could not know without his speech , then no speech would do any good . He was almost angry with her because she had spoken at all . But he pressed her hand again , aware of the extra strength he put into the act beyond the pressure of understanding and affection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , but you do n't understand , " she said with a sudden vehemence , as though she were answering a new avowal of his own . " Do n't you see , do n't you see ? I was always alone . I never had anybody , not anybody . Not my mother or my father . Nobody ever loved me . I never had anybody . Not anybody . Not anybody ... " p 168He had the sudden impulse  --  which shocked him even as it came  --  to say , " Oh , but you had Fort , you had him , " but he suppressed it . But even as he suppressed it , she was going on as though to catch up his thought about Fort . She was saying : " . . . and after , after that  --  when I thought I would have a baby  --  when I thought that that would be mine , that I would have somebody , something . But . . . " She stopped suddenly , and he heard the catch of her breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She repeated : " It was dead . " Then suddenly : " And oh , I had nothing . And I have nothing but you , and when you were away I thought I would die . " She swung to face him on the bench , and jerked her hand free from his clasp , and put a hand on each of his shoulders , clutching hard , saying , " Do n't you understand ? I missed you so . I missed you so ! " She released her grip , and turned partly away , letting her hands lie idle in her lap in a sudden helplessness . " I missed you , " she said quietly . " But it was almost worse before you went away . When you sat with the book late . When you were in the house but never with me . Oh , that was worse , and I could not sleep . I would lie there , and hear you come in , and you thought I was asleep . But I was n't . I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Listen , " he said , " there are things a man has to do . I am engaged in something very important . For you as well as for me . I told you that , before I went away . That I was going on business , important business , and that . . . " But you would n't tell me what it was . " " No , " he replied , " I wanted to surprise you with the fact . " " Is it done ? " she asked . " Is it finished ? You wo n't have to go away again ? " " It is only begun , " he said . " Only begun ! " " Only begun , " he stated . " Oh , what is it ? " she demanded , and laid her hand on him again . " I had not meant to tell you , " he said . " Not yet . " " What is it ? " " If you must know , " he said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? You do n't have to . You can ... " " Can what ? " he demanded , and like a flash he thought he had caught her out . " Can what ? Can stay here  --  on your land ? " " Oh , it 's not my land . You know I did n't mean that . It is your land . I meant , why study surveying ? That would take you away . Away from me . You could stay here . You could . . . " " Stay here , " he continued for her , " and be a foreman on your land . " " It is your land ! " she said , her voice rising . " Did n't I say it was p 169your land ? And you have the law . You have studied law , and you could practice law at Lumton . " " My God , " he burst out , rising from his seat . " My God , law at Lumton ! Listen , " he said , leaning at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west . There is money to be made there . When times change , when ... " " Speculation ? " she demanded . " Speculation ? My father  --  he almost ruined himself . He almost ruined us . If it had not been ... " " Been for what ? " he demanded , leaning closer , waiting , saying to himself that she would have to say it , would have to say how Fort had come to save them , had come into their house to save them and take his pay . " If it had not been for what ? " he repeated . " Oh , I do n't know  --  I do n't know exactly how it was . " " How what was ? " he demanded , and steeled himself , and Fort 's name rang in his head . " The law , " she said , " the new law . The replevin . But it saved something . It saved this place . But it was almost lost . My father almost lost everything . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and took relish in the epithet , expecting some protest from her for her father 's sake . But none came , so he continued . " He speculated at a time when every fool was speculating . When he had to pay too much , for every fool wanted to buy . But now is the time . You can get land for near nothing . Good land to the west . I have seen it . And then when times change ... " " Oh , nothing will ever change , " she cried out in anguish . " I 'll always be alone . I 'll be left alone . You will leave me alone . You will leave me alone , like ... " " Like Fort , " he finished for her . And in the dead silence , he added : " That is what you were about to say , is n't it ? " After a moment , she said dully , " No . No . That is not what I was about to say . " " Well , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't matter now , " she said in the same dull voice , and he was aware even in the shadow that she had turned her face from him and was staring away across the blankness of the garden and the fields . He waited a moment , then said quietly and in self-possession , " If you will excuse me , I think I had better go in . I have some work to do . To sort the notes I have made on the trip west . Good night , my dear . " He waited for her answer , but there was none . So he turned from the arbor and went out of the garden toward the house , where ap 170candle showed a little light from the open door of the main hall . He went to the study , lighted a candle , and sat at the secretary . So he entered anew upon his work , sorting his notes and checking them by the map . After a while , he heard a motion in the hall . Rachel was going upstairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he was aware of her presence . He knew that she lay alone in the bed upstairs , but his awareness was of more than that fact . From that center , from her physical being , a presence , a massive but impalpablepresence as fluid and weightless as dark , flowed out , filling the house , coming down from the region above the stairs which before the last illness of the old woman had been mysterious to him and now , at once , was again mysterious . The very area of brightness of the candle on the desk before him and in the air around him seemed to contract . He began to concentratemore rigorously upon the writing before him , speaking the words out loud like a spell of exorcism . He clung to each word , trustingit , its look on the page in his calligraphy , its twist to his tongue , its sound in his ear , its vision in his mind of the place far away in the west to which it referred , some valley where the timber stood tall and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to catch the dazzling wash of sunlight far above . He did not know how long he was engaged thus , while the bulb of light contracted around him . Then he knew she was in the room . He had heard nothing , but he knew she was there . He told himself , no , it was not possible , he had deluded himself , he would not turn . But he knew it was true . And finally he turned . There she was . She stood halfway between the open door and his chair , standing in a white night-dress , with her hair fallen free and with feet bare as though she had surrendered to an overmastering impulse and had not been able to wait , or think , to take slippers . Or , he asked himself , had she taken thought and left the slippers in order to make no noise , to come down as soundlessly and bodilessly as the dark that flowed down from the rooms above and filled the house , to stand in secret behind him ? And for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark of the hall , the old woman 's face floating as before to spy on him with its intensity of envy and hate . But it was n't there . Only the daughter 's white figure was there , at the edge of candlelight , her face looking at him , and he thought , ah , how love comes to spy as well as hate , and makes no sound . " She was looking mournfully at me and as from a great way off , but in her sadness was a dignity which demanded nothing . I could not be sure , for the wavering light of the candle , but it seemed to me that she shook her head slowly from side to side , ever so little , as one who meditates upon what one would wish otherwise but knows p 171one can not change . She stood so for a time , silent , and I found no word to say , for I could not speak , not knowing what spirit had made her rise and come . When she made a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me , and go as she had come , into the dark hall and beyond . And if she had done so , I might have questioned myself as to the truth of her coming . " But she came toward me at a slow pace without sound for the bareness of her feet , and stood directly before me . She looked down at me , and I expected her to speak . But she did not . The expression of her face remained mournful , but now with a mournfulness temperedwith such sweetness that I felt my heart contract in the bosom . All at once she sank to her knees before me , not taking her eyes from my face . Then she bowed her head upon my lap with a motion which meant submission but a submission seeming aware of the worth of all it gave . Her face lay between my knees and her hair spread over them and hung on each side to the floor , covering them . She did not touch me with her hands , which were quiet at her sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head , and felt how finely it was shaped and thought how much smaller it was than one suspectedseeing it bear the mass of her hair . I had thought this before , when taking her head in my hands , with the hair loose , but now it came as new . So I let my fingers slip into the hair that flowed over my knees on each side , and I felt all the pangs of remorse for what I had said and for being unable to take innocently the proffered good of the world . And I thought how my own words had sprung from something in me I did not know the name or meaning for , and how a man moves in the darkness of himself , more trackless than the wild country , toward a light which glimmers far away . But he does not know what the light may be . ( And now that all has come to pass , do I know ? At this late time I would know , and move toward it , for that is all now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head on my knee , I looked down at her and thought , too , how she had wandered in her own darkness and toward what glimmer of light . And thought how perhaps she had hoped I might be the way , and might take her band and guide her and know the name of the light toward which she moved , and how in that hope she had risen from her bed and come to me through the house . Then when I thought how she might have trusted me , who knew nothing , a great pitifulness filled me for her and despair that I could be worthy . " But that night , while he leaned over her bowed head and was filled with pity and despair , the book on surveying and the notes and the map of the country away to the west still lay on the secre-p 172tary under the candlelight . And we know that Jeremiah went to Frankfort in the late summer of 1823 , to investigate certain tracts at the land office there . By this time the western lands had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had even sold his farm on Green River and removed his wife to Pick County , near Frankfort . So the thought of Fort gave way to more pressing concerns . He made the acquaintance of Felix , the son of Josh Parham , a big landholderand the center of Anti-Relief sentiment . He attempted to persuade Felix Parham into some sort of partnershipfor the land deal to the west , but this must have been equivalent to persuading the old man , for Felix was young , only a little older than Jeremiah , and was much under his old father 's influence . Exactlyhow Jeremiah presented his case , we do not know , for all he says is that he made " no attempt to palliate or apologize for political views which the old gentleman held abhorrent . " But the old man , no doubt , put a good business deal on a higher plane than any matter of politics , or being a good practical man , he saw politics as a mere coefficient of business and believed that if Jeremiah was in political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a sound businessventure . And the venture in the West was one which he at least thought worth considering . Jeremiah must have convinced him of that , and convinced him that he , Jeremiah , had some quality which the son lacked . For the son was known as a sort of ne'er-do-well , a lover of wenches and the bottle , a vain , idle young man , who , according to popular report , would long since have failed at his farming if the father had not supervised him and made up his deficits . In any case , in the early fall , before the harvest , Jeremiah and Felix Parham started again west , accompanied by the young neighborboy who had been with Jeremiah before , and the same slave . The little expedition did not return this time until cold weather had definitely set in , up in November . But despite short rations , hard marches , and bad weather , Jeremiah returned in high spirits . He had found a better location than he had hoped , with excellent town sites . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to play second-fiddle to Felix . Decisions had been his , for " Felix , like all men given to pleasure , lacked force of will , and would surrender to the force of another 's will if that force was applied in a way not to offend his considerable vanity . " It promised to be an ideal partnership . He hoped now to persuade the old man to a final arrangement . The moment was propitious . The old man was in fine fettle , for " Now , by God , " he said , " this country will not be given over to the pot-washings and scum of mankind , an a debt will be a debt again in the face of Hell and replevin , and an honest man can settle down again to make an honest dollar the way All-mighty God intended p 173and none to say nay . " For on October 8 , the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth had upheld Judge Clark 's decision of the Bourbon County Circuit Court that the replevin laws were unconstitutional and void . Williams would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $219.67 . Jeremiah already knew the fact . He had heard it in the first tavern they encountered on the way back , in the smoke-filled , stench-filled single room where they ate fat meat scarcely hot through and soggy corn pone and drank whisky out of a mug passed from hand to hand before lying down to sleep , all together , gaunt-faced family and all , on the flea-ridden bearskins . On their brief stops he had heard all the wild talk . They would hang John Boyle . They would burn Frankfort , every stick of it , and not leave a stone standing , and sow to salt , and piss on the spot . For what was a state for if not to help a man when he was hungry ? And by God , it was their state , Court or no Court , lawyers or no lawyers , rich or no rich . Courts and lawyers and sheriffs and rich  --  all worse than redskins or redcoats , and , like them , mortal when the plug bit in . We know what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lonely crossroads . Jeremiah does not record it . He does not need to do so , for we know what those men were , and we know the fury of betrayal which swept the country when the Court  --  their own Court  --  gave down the decision which seemed to pass a man over , bound hand and foot , to the moneylender and the sheriff , and to the " honest man , " as old Parham said , who wanted to make an " honest dollar . " Hearing old Parham say that , Jeremiah suddenly felt that there could be no partnership . What had he to do with these people ? The " plump-faced , purse-lipped young dandy on whom the travel-stained garments seemed to hang as a reproach and abomination and not as the mark of honest toil , " who knew no woodcraft , no farming , no law , no trade , no book , no way of men or beasts or land or weather  --  not even a cunning trick of brawl or plugmuss  --  who could barely spell out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whisky in the gullet and the tickle of flesh ? Or the hawk-faced old man with the slit-eyes that looked out to calculate you and the world , and the heavy , knotted hands which had seized on the world and still crooked i or more ? Which was worse , he did not know , the young man 's softnessor the old man 's hardness ? He felt like saying good day , and turning his back on them forever . Old Parham was saying , " Yes , Mr. Beaumont , you go on home and get some rest and fix up your reports . Then you go on up to Frankfort , and check the tracts . You said you were going to Frankfort ? " Jeremiah nodded. p 174 " Well , when you get back , if it 's good enough , we can begin to talk business . Yes , sir , business . If that Legislature full of scoundrels do n't blow up this country . Looks like they 're fixing to try to break the Court . That Legislature , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legislature , up there in Frankfort ! They remove the Court and there wo n't be any business . Not for you and me or nobody . " Well , Jeremiah thought , in that case he would find some other way . But in Frankfort , his business done at the land office , he was drawn , almost unwillingly , to the capitol where the Legislature now held its session . " I found myself , " he says , " in a most peculiar position . On the one hand , my conviction had been and was for the Relief , and had I not been in the Western parts at the time of the election that year , certainlymy sacred ballot had been cast for that faction . On the other hand the defeat of the Relief in the Legislature would make for my private interests insofar as they depended on Mr. Parham . What was the meaning of this fact , I asked myself as I stood in the street of Frankfort that winter day . Was I a double-dealer , in my heart , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope in the heart ? And I felt like crying out that I had not made the world , and why should I be blamed , and why should I alone be made to suffer for a love of singleness , while others swam like fish with open mouths in the sweet various stream of things ? I said to myself that I had never concealed my opinion , that I was clear before men and should therefore be found clear before myself . I said that what the Legislature did , whether for my good or ill , was like the weather that comes and you can not stop it . Should I blame myself because rain falls on my corn to save it , and ruins the cut hay in my neighbor 's field ? I would have turned away , gone to the stable , taken my horse , and ridden off from Frankfort , and thus dismissed the whole matter . But I could not bring myself to do this , Instead , I walked toward the room where those men sat who held our fortunes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pick his wound to see it bleed and feel the pain . " So he went to the chamber , to twitch his scab . He leaned against the wall , near the door , and listened , A tall , erect man , graceful for all his length of bone and abrupt gesture , was speaking . He wore a black suit , with but a touch of white at the throat . His features , Jeremiah says , were strongly marked to an uncommon degree , not to be called handsome , but his face was such as to hold attention , with a powerful jaw , flashing eyes , and the expression of one born to command . He spoke on the " sacred nature of our human society , with good voice and wide reference , and how the Court of the Corn- p 175monwealth had acted but to maintain the trust of man to man , but his remarks were more notable for fire and persuasion than for the close-knit thought . " There was a touch on Jeremiah 's shoulder , and he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his , leaning at him , smilingto show the white , even teeth and make the eyes glitter . " Ah , " Wilkie whispered , " so you have come to the seats of the mighty ! " He took Jeremiah 's hand , pressed it warmly , and then laid his arm across Jeremiah 's shoulder . " And tha't , " he added , nodding toward the tall man in black who was speaking , " is the mightiest of all . That is the Duke . " Jeremiah looked inquiringly at Wilkie , but before he could frame his question or remember what he had heard in the past , Wilkie said , " Yes , the Duke , my dear country cousin . " At the words , he gave Jeremiah 's shoulder an affectionate squeeze . " John Wickliffe , and is n't he every inch the Duke ? " Jeremiah nodded . " The Duke ! " Wilkie echoed , with an edge of scorn in his tone . His bright eyes narrowed . " The Duke  --  and the giant we will slay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Anti-Relief . He owns half the country , and would take it all ! But , look . . . " and he nodded to indicate a man who was across the chamber , a heavy , fattish man in nondescript dress , who strolled in the open space beyond the seats , with bowed head , as though walking alone in the garden or wood to meditate , not hearing the words of the orator , or contemptuous of them . " But look "  --  Wilkie repeated , " that is the giant-killer . That is Rowan . " " John Rowan , " Jeremiah murmured , and stared curiously at the man who was the founder and father of Relief . " Yes , " Wilkie said , " and he will bring the mighty low . You will see him for yourself , for I sup with him tonight . Will you come ? " Jeremiah was prepared to say no , that he could not , but Wilkie squeezed his shoulder again , and said , " Of course , you 'll come . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weisiger House at six . " Then Wilkie was gone , and Duke Wickliffe 's elegant height dominatedthe assembly , his eyes flashed , and his fine voice filled the room . Then ' Jeremiah thought , " He is speaking for me . " And with that thought , that the Duke was his partisan , the words suddenly sounded hollow and false to him . So he left the place , and went to walk in the winter street , deserted now in the dusk , until the clocks struck and it was time to go to join Wilkie at the Weisiger House . Wilkie was standing in the big room at the Weisiger , talking to two men there , teetering on his heels and gesturing with a cigar p 176They were laughing at something he had just said . Then he stopped teetering , leaned at them and said something with a confidential smile . At that they laughed louder than before . Then Wilkie saw Jeremiah , who had stopped some paces away . He excused himself from the men , and came quickly to Jeremiah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar . When the drinks had been ordered , Wilkie said , " It 'll be quite a party . Mr. Madison is coming . You remember him ? You met him with me in Lexington . " Jeremiah nodded . " And Skrogg . He is bringing Davis , Samuel Davis . Davis , now , he is a rare one . He has iron in him . Was a waggoner , and could n't sign his name . But he has taught himself . The world has been hard on him , and now he 'll be hard on the world . But hard in a good cause . He is iron , afraid of no man , Henry Clay or the Duke . " Then Wilkie-looked up , and said , " Ah , gentlemen ! " And there they were , Mr. Madison and Skrogg , John Rowan and Samuel Davis . With the greetings and the introductions and the first drink , Jeremiah looked at the strangers , and the descriptions he has given are as clear as any that have been preserved to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was the giant-killer Rowan , a tall , fattish , shapeless man , with a heavy , sagging , dark , morose face , large of feature , saturnine and abstracted by turns , wearing big spectacles , through which he peered at you with a sudden access of cunning , or behind which his nearsighted eyes would as suddenly veil themselves " as though he found nothing above contempt in what he saw and would turn his gaze inward . " Davis , who wore a cheap green blanket overcoat ( in which he continued to sweat until they went to the table ) , was a " short , powerfully built , shambling man , long of arm , with coarse greasy face marked by pertinacity and self-complaisance . When he spoke , which was not often , his voice was harsh and rasping , and he set forth opinion with the dogmatism and bitterness of one who will brook no opposition . He drank much as he stood there , and the sweat dropped from his long hair to the collar of his coat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general gathering , the talk turned to Wickliffe 's speech of the afternoon defending Judge Boyle and the Supreme Court . Mr. Madison was analyzing what he considereddefects of logic in the Duke 's argument , when Davis , who had said nothing at the table to that point , suddenly rasped his chair back and exclaimed : " Let him talk . ' T is the ungreased axle streaks . Let him talk . Talk and flap . A fish flaps most when he 's out of water and the hook 's in him . Talking do n't count . Talking never split no log . It takes a glut and a wedge , and , by God , he 's the log we 'll split. p 177It 's the vote that counts . Let him talk , and wait for the vote . That 's the glut and the wedge , and the oak ai n't growed wo n't split to the shrewd stroke . We 'll drive it home . " " But , " Mr. Madison replied courteously , " the vote is not yet and . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote , " Davis affirmed . " Yes , " Mr. Madison said , " I know that many are already committed , but , for some , the force of argument ... " " Argument ! " Davis uttered with scorn . " They 'll vote the way they are bought . The bastards are bought from birth ! What in God 's name else is Anti-Relief ? But them the rich has bought ? And , by God , if they do the buying , we 'll do the ... " He stopped , laid his hands on the white tablecloth . They were great , blunt hands , hairy , callousedand scarred , with fingers that did not flatten out straight . " And if the removal vote fails , there is one thing . . . " But Rowan stopped , suddenly peering at Jeremiah . But Wilkie caught the look . " Mr. Rowan , " he said , " I can assure you that Mr. Beaumont is our friend . There is no need for reticence , he is the man who fought by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Skrogg turned his pale , peeled face to Jeremiah , and inspected him as though he had suddenly come upon him for the first time . Then said : " Yes , he fought , " but with a tone that seemed to put the cold fact into the air , without commitment . Mr. Madison , however , was saying , " Of course , Mr. Rowan , you may speak . Mr. Beaumont is one of us , and the friend of justice . " For an instant longer , Rowan 's gaze pointed upon Jeremiah , then withdrew . " There is one more step , " he said . " If the removal fails . We can change the Constitution of this Commonwealth . We can call a convention . " " Yeah , " Davis said , " and if you ca n't get the vote for removal , how can you get it for a convention ? ' T is all the same , but I know the way . Yeah , I know the way . " He stirred heavily in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to explain his view . They might get removal of the judges . It would be a close vote . If not , there was always the good chance of getting some to vote for a convention who could not bring themselves to vote for removal . For , as Rowan explained , a man who voted against removal under compulsion and with grudging and fear could be brought to vote for the convention as a way of washing his hands . Of saying , " Look , I pass the responsibility back to the people . I am an honest man and I trust the people . " It would be a way of avoiding the issue . And Rowan added , there were men like that , who in the pinch always sought to avoid the issue . And his own mouth curled on the wordsp 178with his contempt for , and in knowledge of , the world . And he added , it might even be a way for a bought man to break with his buyer , to think to go direct to the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be free . If just for one instant . And his mouth curled again , and fell silent , while others took up the debate . In the middle of the debate , Skrogg , who had taken no part , abruptly rose , saying that he had to finish an article for the Advocate . " Wait , " Rowan said , " I must go too . " And Davis rose with him . They paid their score , said good night , and left the table , and Jeremiah watched them make their way across the big room to the door , Rowan tall and shapeless , Davis , short , long-armed , and powerful , Skrogg between them , thin , stooped and sick , with the high , narrow skull leaning forward and to one side , and pipestem wrists hanging out of his shabby sleeves . Wilkie was saying , " Mr. Madison , why do n't you break now to Beaumont what we lately talked of ? What concerns him ? " And Mr. Madison said : " Mr. Beaumont . " And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county , Sellars , as you know , is still in the Legislature . He is a fool and a blackguard . He is the man you fought against that day at Lumton . He was nearly beat by Pollock and could have been beat by a better man , but Pollock , though good and upright , has little intellect and no fire . But Pollock was the best Relief could run in that county . And will be the best next year . Unless . . . " He leaned across the table toward Jeremiah , with courtesy but intensity , looking into his face . " Unless , " he repeated , " you will run . " At once the whole scene seemed unreal to Jeremiah . He thought , I am not here , not in Frankfort , for this , I thought I was here about the lands in the West , but I have been lured here , it is a trap , I have been lured into a trap . Almost violently , he shook his head , saying , " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with his gray , severe eyes , saying earnestly , " But it is your duty . If you can subdue your natural modesty and preference for the private life . It is your duty . " Then Mr. Madison suddenly sat back in his chair , and smiled . " Forgiveme , " he said . " I should not presume to instruct you in your duty . I can only say that , other obligations not forbidding , a man 's highest good is to serve the state , and you , Mr. Beaumont ... " Jeremiah was thinking , he talks like Fort , the way Fort used to talk , and Fort was a villain . But you could not think this man a villain , with that direct gray gaze and fine forehead . And Wilkie was speaking , begging Mr. Madison 's pardon , saying : " You could be elected , Jerry . Oh , they remember how you foughtp 179at Lumpton for Relief . And what you did at Tupper 's tavern that day ... " At Tupper 's tavern ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What I did  --  what I did  --  nobody understood  --  the old man cursed me  --  for saving him  --  and the others , the Relief people  --  they would have cursed me , too  --  they said ... " " They understand now , Jerry . All think you acted the part of a man . " The gangling man at Tupper 's tavern , with the broadside in his hand , stood in the dark of Jeremiah 's mind , leaning at him , saying again , " Oh , yeah , you  --  you was smart to git you a fine place  --  youknowed how to git you one .... " And Jeremiah suddenly felt himself , saw himself on the hustings , speaking to a great crowd , speaking of justice and right , and that hairy face was there before him , calling out , " Oh , yeah , you  --  you was smart .... " Mr. Madison had risen and come around the table . He stood beside Jeremiah 's chair . " I must go now , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . And you must promise me one thing , or I cannot go . " Jeremiah rose awkwardly , and mumbled his question . " Promise me , " Mr. Madison said , and placed his hand on Jeremiah 's shoulder , " that you will think seriously . Before you make a decision against us . I know your heart , my boy . That has been proved . It is a heart of oak , yet sensitive to the slightest breeze of justice . But before you promise , one more word , for I would be honest with you . " " Yes ? " Jeremiah said . " It is this . I am asking you to surrender part of your happiness ; that would be the price you would have to pay to serve the state . There is only the happiness there of a good conscience . If "  --  and he smiled gravely  --  " you can keep a good conscience in politics . " He released his grip on Jeremiah 's shoulder , then slapped the shoulder . " But you will promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled again , but this time with a touch of gaiety that made him look fleetinglyboyish for all his dignity and gray hair . " I promise you , " Jeremiah said , though he had not willed that answer . " Good , " Mr. Madison said , and offered his hand . " Your hand upon it . " They shook hands . " And good night , " Mr. Madison said , and turned away . Jeremiah looked after the departing figure , wondering why he had given the promise . Then he turned to find Wilkie 's gaze upon him . You promised him , " Wilkie said , smiling like a man who knows a secret . " Do n't forget that you promised him . " p 180 " I must go , " Jeremiah said . " One drink more ? " Wilkie invited . " I must ride tomorrow , " Jeremiah said . Jeremiah waited while Wilkie paid , and then they moved toward the door together . Then just as Jeremiah was about to take his leave , Wilkie said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know it will cut across your plans , but if you will take the advice of a friend , I would think seriously on those , too . " " What do you mean ? " Wilkie looked curiously at him in the half-light . " Your land project in the West , " he said finally . " It is a good project , " Jeremiah said hotly . " I have been there . " Wilkie shook his head . " The time is not ripe , " he said . " I warrant you could do better to wait . I could tell you when to go ahead . " " How do you know of my plans ? " Jeremiah demanded . " Ah , " Wilkie said , and smiled closely , " I know many things , my boy . It is my business to know . For instance , I know "  --  the smile flickered off this face  --  " that you are dealing with Felix Parham , or rather with old Parham . " " You know that , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I know that it is a mistake . You will tie yourself to him , to a hard man , to Anti-Relief , to what you will abhor in the end . Unless , " Wilkie added softly , " you are like Sellars , and would lick another man 's spit . " " God damn it ! " Jeremiah cried out , and jerked from Wilkie 's side , and was about to damn him , too , when Wilkie reached out to touch him like a man laying hand on a stung horse . " Oh , you are not Sellars . You are Jerry Beaumont , and he would not lick spit , and be lackey-boy . No , not to a king ! " He wound up with a flourish , drawing himself up as on a platform , and then laughed at his own oratory . Jeremiah looked at him with some sullenness , but Wilkie said , " Oh , Jerry , Jerry , forgive me if I have my fun . And do n't be angry with me , for I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from my old affection . Do n't do what you will regret . Do n't back the wrong horse . " " I promised Madison I would think it over , " Jeremiah said distantly . " That is all I can say . " He thought it over as he walked back that night through the dark streets past the blackened ruins of the capitol to the modest tavern where he was lodging , and later he lay in his bed on a straw tick , thinking . Duty , Mr. Madison had said . Justice , Mr. Madison had said . Yes , Jeremiah told himself , he believed in those things . He believed , for he had a duty , a sworn oath , an obligation taken freelyp 181on himself . He believed , for he had sworn an oath to do justice . Yes , he would do his duty and do justice , when the time came . Duty and justice , as they lay in his heart . But what was his duty and justice was not another man 's . What led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Skrogg ? Davis ? Rowan ? He had a sudden longing to see into the being of those men and know the secret springs of their action . Madison  --  there was no whisper against him . The worst men said was that he was a politician , and loved power . But there were the steady , gray eyes , full of strength and candor , and the voice which could say duty and justice as calmly as you said Good morning . Did he want power clothed in duty and justice , or justice and duty clothed in power ? And Skrogg , who had no fear , who was sick and weak but strong as a lion for some inner fire ? Were duty and justice the fuel for the flame , or were they the smoke from that fire ? And Davis , was it hate for those who had made him suffer , or love for duty and justice ? And Rowan  --  oh , he knew the story of that stained and devious life , what men said , the doubleness and trickery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for love of justice but as a last trick , Rowan who , they said , knew how to finger every stop and fret of poor human nature because he knew the secrets of his own so well ? Or had Rowan founded Relief as a last attempt to redeem , or break from , the disordered past and stained self ? And he asked himself , had he had the history of any one of them , would he have been different from that one ? Was his own conviction for Relief but the result of his own father 's last poverty and defeat ? The result of his memory of his mother , tired , leaning on a hoe toward evening in a scraggly garden patch by the edge of a field ? What if he , Jeremiah Beaumont , had taken old Marcher 's offer and had becomeJeremiah Marcher ? Then would he have been like the Duke , clothed in elegant black to rise and speak of duty and justice and the sacred bond of man to man in society ? But the justice and duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest  --  whatever they were . And what was Madison 's was not Skrogg 's nor Davis 's nor Rowan 's . And what was his , Jeremiah Beaumont 's , was not theirs . Yet each man would seize on all others and make his duty and justice theirs . They would seize on him , on JeremiahBeaumont , to make their duty and justice his . But what would they offer him ? What reason ? Only the words , duty and justice ? At that thought , Wilkie was before him , as he had been in the ( lark street , saying , " Do n't do what you will regret . Do n't back the wrong horse . " p 182So that was it , his mind replied , clear as a bell , and Wilkie had unmasked all the others , and what was their duty and justice was the horse that they thought would win , and if you did not win , what you had done was not duty or justice , for only those who won survivedto say what was duty or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fooled all but Wilkie , good old Wilkie , honest old Wilkie , who told you the truth , to save you , and let you sleep . But was that Wilkie 's truth ? Was that all Wilkie had to say ? Was that the heart of the world , and of friendship and love ? With the question a great desolation shook him , and he felt terribly alone . No , that could not be Wilkie . It could not be anybody , for with that truth no man could live , and Wilkie was Wilkie , and Wilkie had spoken thus but to make him free . Free ? What had John Rowan said , with his curled , contemptuous lip ? " For the fool who is bought still longs to be free . " So that was it . Duty and justice made you free . They were the words you used for what would make you free . The truth would make you free . But each man 's chains were different , and you did not know your own chains but knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty and justice . And no man could tell you what they were , and when they tried , the best they said in the end was , do n't back the wrong horse . You would have to find truth yourself and he would find his own . He knew where it lay . He heard the watch call in the street , then , far off , shouting and laughter , then the watch call again . He would be up early and would ride south to Rachel . He rode south to Rachel , but also to old Parham , who said , yes , the project was good , but they could do no business yet , not till he knew what the fool Legislature would do , whether they would respect the law of the land and the Constitution or would break the Court . To which Jeremiah replied that the Legislature had been elected by the people and he trusted that it would execute the will of the people . " Of a rout of blackguards and bankrupts , " the old man rejoined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So you 're for Relief , Mr. Beaumont ? " " I had told you that , " Jeremiah said . " You know if that Legislature goes Relief , we ca n't do no business ? " " Yes , " Jeremiah replied . The old man shook his head . " You 're a queer one , Mr. Beaumont , " he said , and laughed shortly . But he looked again , from his hard eyes , and said , " But you know , Mr. Beaumont , maybe we can do business , after all . I will let you hear from me . " So Jeremiah went back home , and waited . There was nothing to p 183do but wait for the action of the Legislature and the word from old Parham , to push the work in making ready for the mill , and to enjoy Rachel . For in that period of waiting , in the middle of winter , they seemed to draw more deeply than ever before into a warm inner world of their own , leaving the hard frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm in the root of a winter tree or the furred animal curled in its warm earth to dream away the season . In that time news scarcely penetrated to him , and he made no effort to get it . He was days late in learning that the judges had not been unseated . He felt no elation at this help to his prospects , and no distress at the set-back to Relief . And when he learned that the call for a constitutional convention had passed the House but had been defeated in the Senate , eighteen to eighteen , he felt nothing . Now he would hear from old Parham . Well , he would hear . After some days the note came . Jeremiah laid it aside . Was this what he had hoped for most deeply ? He did not know . All he knew was that now he lived in his winter dream . He would rouse himself from that some day . It was late January before he rode to the Parham place , to discuss the terms of the partnership . The terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Josh Parham had his way . " I could hire me lawyers for chips and whetstones in these times , " Parham said . " And surveyors , too . " " But you ca n't hire me , Mr. Parham , " Jeremiah said quietly . " I am not interested in being hired . Only in a partnership . " " But what do you bring to it ? " " I bring myself , " Jeremiah said . " Yourself ! " the old man snorted . " Listen , " Jeremiah said , suddenly surprised at his own cunning and boldness . " I know what you want . You do not want money . You have money . You are doing this for your son . And I know your son , Mr. Parham . He is a waster , Mr. Parham . " " I 'd have you know , sir . . . " Mr. Parham began . But Jeremiah interrupted : " I know what I know , and I know that you hope to make a man of him . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you want me to take him . Well , if you do n't want me , I bid you good day . " So he turned his back and got out the door . But the old man 's voice called him back . It was done . He and Josh Parham were partners . But it was a strange partnership , for the present a partnership only in waiting . It was the year for the election of governor , and Parham would not take serious action until he knew how the cat was going to jump . The best that Jeremiah could persuade him to was to finance a somewhatp 184more ambitious expedition into the West for further exploration . After the return from the West , he sent Captain Marlowe , his neighbor , to Frankfort to file some patents at the registrar 's office , and accepted , with what patience he could muster , the long delay . And the spring and summer passed with the old occupations , his work on the farm , his pleasure in Rachel 's society , his games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day when he would be rich and stand justified before all men . For a moment , in August of that year  --  it was 1824  --  that dream seemed ended for good and all , when Desha , the Relief candidate , was elected governor . Desha promised to break the Court of Appeals and set up a new Court . Josh Parham raged and swore that no penny of his would now go to open up land in Kentucky , for he spat on the state . But his fit passed , his old cunning returned , and he said , well , they 'd just have to wait , wait till next year . He promised that in the spring he himself would go with Jeremiah to select town sites . The next spring they would begin in good earnest . In the spring Rachel told Jeremiah that she was to have a child . His joy in that thought was enough to make him forget politics and land and all else . Then he remembered that land was money and greatness . He did not care for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rich and great . So in those nights of early spring he would wake to hear rain on the roof , and then , far off , thunder , and he would reach to take Rachel 's hand and hold it in the dark . Ah , this was the end for which life was made . Then he saw the news in the Advocate . Colonel Cassius Fort had returned from the East , after a long sojourn . He had rested a few days at his own residence in Pick County , where he had removed from Saul County , but was now at the Weisiger House , in Frankfort , where he had come to confer with the leaders of politics . It was mid-morning of a bright day in March , with full sun streamingthrough the windows of the library behind the chair where Jeremiahsat . He had reached the end of the item before the meaning struck home . " My God , " he said aloud , and rose from his chair , " My God , what am I ? I read it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the room , clutching the paper . He stared at the slow fire on the hearth . Then out the window . A flock of robins hopped about on the lawn , pecking the dead grass . He counted them , and later he writes of the act : " I counted them , and there were seven , but even as I counted , I wondered why I should do so while I held that paper in my hand and knew that Fort wasp 185alive and in Kentucky . Then I tore myself from the sight , and uttered again , my God , am I Jeremiah Beaumont ? " He went from the library , and across the hall and upstairs to the little sitting room where Rachel was . She was sitting before a small easel , with her paint box by her side , and a big book propped in another chair before her . " Look , " she said as he entered , and lifted her face toward him , bright with excitement , " look ! " And she rose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , and picked up the book , and brought it to him . " There 's just an engraving here , " she said , " just an engraving of Downe Castle . That 's where the Bonnie Earl of Murray died . " She held the book before him , but so fleetingly that he saw nothing but the blur of black lines on white paper . " But I 've copied it , " she said . " I 've painted it as it must be in Scotland . " The big book drooped with its weight in one hand , and with the other she seized him and drew him to the easel . " Look , " she commanded , " look ! " We do not know what he saw . Probably some trivial daub of a gray castle perched dramatically on gray rock , with a river , far too white and blue , below , and to one side two or three sheep , far too white , on a too green patch of meadow , with a kilted shepherd leaning on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures . But there are few in attics or old trunks or Negro cabins now . And there are none in the museums where the " primitives " hang to show us the tavern or the quilting party or the severe face of the Merchant from Nashville , those things which were American , but were no more American than those things which were not American but the things which America dreamed it was , but was not . We do not know what book she copied from . But we know what Jeremiah Beaumont said . " It is very pretty , " he said , and gave it scarcely a glance . " But you have n't looked , " she complained , bright-eyed , flush -- cheeked from excitement , with her hair coming loose on one side . " I must go , " he said abruptly . " What ? " " I must ride today , " he said . " West ? " she demanded . " West ? Are you  --  are you leaving me again  --  so soon ? " " Frankfort , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Will it take long ? " He took a step toward her and stopped immediately before her . " Long enough , " he said , " to whip a villain in the public street . Until he shows fight . " " Oh , " she breathed , " oh , " and he saw dismay grow on her face. p 186 " Look ! " he commanded , and thrust the paper at her . " Look  --  Fort is in Kentucky ! " She lowered her face toward it , slowly , as though by an effort of will , while he held the paper before her . " You see it , " he said , and snatched back the paper and crumpled it and flung it to one side . " And I ride today . Now . " Then she reached to seize him by the wrist . " No ! " she cried out . " What ? " " Oh , it 's different now . " " Different ? " he demanded , trying to release himself . " My God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort different ? Are you different ? And do n't forget what you made me swear . " For an instant , she stared at him with a kind of terror in her face . Then she burst out : " Oh , that was because  --  that was only because ... " " Because what ? " " Because I was crazy then , I was crazy then and I did it because . . . " She drew back from him and stared at him . " Because what ? " " Because you made me , " she said very softly . " Oh , I see it now , you made me . " " I made you ? " he echoed with a sudden cold constriction of the heart . Then sternly : " Do n't be a fool . You did it because Fort betrayed you and you hated him . " " But I did n't , I did n't hate him , I ... " He leaned at her , fixing her with his glance . " You did n't what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly , and shook her head . " Not before you came . But you came and you tortured me and you made me tell you , you knew all the time but you made me tell you to torture me , you made me show you the grave  --  the grave where he ... " She paused , and then her voice suddenly became a wail : ... where my baby was  --  he was dead and I had nothing , nothing  --  but I could have lived with nothing if you had not come and taken all my strength and made me crazy and weak , if you had n't come . . . ' " But I came , " he broke in harshly , " and I swore to kill Fort . " He turned toward the door , but she rushed after him and swung him to face her and slipped to her knees , clutching his thighs . " My baby was dead and he is in the ground , " she said , " but that was then , and now it 's different , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's me , and he 's ours , he 's ours , and you ca n't ever go ! " No , he could not go . He would stay and sit by his wife and take joy in the thought of the son that he had , in his old rage , forgotten . But with that joy came speculation to taint it . Had he not , all the while , p 187in some corner of his mind , really remembered the child ? Had he not really known , therefore , that he could not go ? Had there been a hollowness in his rage ? Had the rage been , in its very violence , but an abstract rage , a false shadow ? Could he never have peace with himself ? But he had peace on one point . Even if she now accused him of cruelty , it had been necessary for him to torture her to make her speak and tell him the old impediment to their love . That had been the only way to release her from the chains of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a dream . He dreamed that he stood at the edge of a big woods , a forest , toward night , and the forest was full of shadow . It was fall or winter , for the trees were nearly bare . He seemed to recognize the place as some place he had seen in the West , but it was different , too , from any place he had seen in Kentucky , and he did not know the names of the trees . That fact was terrible to him , and he struggled in his mind to know their names . Then he saw the form on the ground before him . He saw it with no surprise because at the moment of perception he knew that he had already known it there . It was a strong man 's form , naked , lying on the back , and bleeding from a wound in the chest . He could not make out the face , no matter how hard he tried , but he knew that it was the face of Cassius Fort . He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would feel the great joy that all had been done for , but when he looked , there was only a patch of grayness that swam in his sight and made him think of the gray growth on the eyes of the blind and made him fear that it was coming on his own . So he would look quickly away to be confirmed in his vision . Looking up thus , he saw Rachel , more beautiful than in life . She was kneeling on the ground , beyond the head of the bleeding form , and was staring at him with horror and reproach . He was compelled to speak to her , to justify himself , and tell her that now they could be happy . But the words would not come , though he thought he would strangle with the effort of speech . Then , as he looked , he saw that her face was changing . The brown spot on her cheek was enormous and each instant was larger and more devouring . It was Rachel 's face and was not Rachel 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of the old woman , her mother , peering at him , spying on him from the shadows . Then it was all discolored , but was still Rachel 's face and the mother 's face , but was another face as well , and he knew its name , but like the names of the trees it would not come to him . Then she lifted her hands to her face , where the horror was in-p 188creased by the fact that he saw Rachel 's white bosom beneath . She said , staring above her hands , to him , " Look , what you have done to me . " At that he knew that there was something which could be said to make all clear , but speech would not come , though the agony of his effort grew greater . He felt cold , and a great desolation overcame him . He woke at this point , with desolation still on him . For a moment he could not be sure that the dream was past . But there was a little moonlight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rachel was beside him . He had the great desire to see her face , but he could not make it out clearly in the little light . So he rose from the bed and lighted a candle from the embers on the hearth . He leaned above her , shielding the light from her eyes with one hand , staring down at her . It was the face of Rachel , relaxed and young in sleep , younger lookingthan he had ever seen it , as it must have been years before when she was little more than a child , before anything had ever happened . There was such pathos in that thought , that he almost bent to kiss the spot on the cheek , which in the candlelight looked good . A week later , mid-morning on a Sunday , Jeremiah was sitting in the library mulling over his maps when he heard a great halloo out front , and went to the porch . There was Wilkie , gracefully sitting a fine , restive bay gelding , and behind him Skrogg , gaunt and more sicklookingthan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health than himself . As Jeremiah ran down the steps , Wilkie , smiling , swung from his saddle with the lightness of a boy , calling out , " Fill up the pot , open the cellar , rob the smoke-house ! I told you I 'd come . And I knew you would n't be at church , you old infidel . " Jeremiah took his hand , feeling happy and excited , then turned to Skrogg , who was painfully dismounting his rickety form . Jeremiah yelled for somebody to come for the horses , now tethered to posts at the edge of the drive , and led the guests into the house , saying all the while how glad he was , how Rachel would be glad , how he would run upstairs and fetch her . He established them in the library , and went for her . " I told her , " he says , " of the arrival of my dear friend Wilkie , and when I noticed nothing in her expression but apathy or a trace of displeasure , I repeated what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and added that it was her old friend , Wilkie Barron . She indicated that she knew him , and rose with an air of duty more than pleasure which puzzled me for the moment to make me think that she must be unwilling to be reminded of the past , who had seen nop 189one but myself , her mother , the captain and Mrs. Marlowe , and the servants in all the long time since the dire event of her betrayal . For the first time it struck me what a strange life we had led , she and I , but it had not seemed strange to me before , for it had been what I sought . Or the truth might be , I thought as I followed her down the stairs , that she feared not only the past but also the future and resentedthese guests because , like my project in the West , they might call me forth into the world to leave her alone . " But she greeted them with all properness and the good forms of hospitality , though Wilkie no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her than I had expected , but I decided that this rose from his delicacy of feeling . His delay in coming to us , and his formality now that he had come at last , I took to be a way of saying to us both that he presumed on nothing from the past , and regarded her but as the wife of his good friend . " We entered upon general conversation , and sat thus in the library until Rachel was called about her wifely duties to see that dinner was made for our guests . At dinner she was attentive to all , and took polite part in the conversation . Wilkie and I spoke most , and of old times in Bowling Green , as friends will who long parted speak of the past to assure themselves of what has bound them together . Wilkie told stories of that time with such good humor and wit that once or twice she smiled ( though she was never much given to a lighter vein ) , and I laughed to split my sides as I had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Immediately after our repast , Skrogg , who had been silent and apart , was taken by a fit of coughing that brought blood , so we prevailedupon him to lie down in a chamber above to recover himself . Rachel brought a syrup for him , and then excused herself from the society of Wilkie and myself . We went down to the library , where Wilkie turned abruptly to me with a grave face to say that he feared for Skrogg , whose heart was iron but whose body straw , and that should he fall ill or die it would be tragedy not only for private friends but for the Commonwealth . I murmured something appropriate , but Wilkie cut in to say that I did not understand how bad things were . I could see that Skrogg was sick , I replied . " Not that , ' he said impatiently . It is an ill wind brings us here . ' " An ill wind ? ' I replied jestingly . I had thought it was love of me and my good larder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor sortie , then demanded had I heard the news . Before I could answer , he broke out feelingly , Oh , you were right , and read his black heart better than I. ' " Who ? ' " Fort ! ' he said , the perfect Judas , consummate and complete . Hep 190broke with us . Last week . But worse , he has betrayed us . He has betrayedRelief . Read this , ' he commanded , and drew a handbill from his pocket and thrust it at me . " AN IMPORTANT COMMUNICATIONTo the People of KentuckyFrom Colonel Cassius FortDear Friends : We live in parlous times , and desperate diseases demand desperate remedies . Our dear land has been , and is sick , and I was among the first to support Relief though knowing it to be a strong medicine . I did this most prayerfully , and I challenge any man to discover to the publiceye that I had any private interest to be served . I say this for what protection I can against slander , that crow which flies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which now gluts itself full on carrion under our distempered skies . But I do not say it in invidiousness or failing in respect for my late associates in Relief , whom I have known to be honorable men and to be named thus with no twisted tongue of sarcasm . I would pay them this due tribute , now at the moment when I must detach myself from them and disenthrall myselffrom the error into which I judge them to be fallen . I judge it error , yea , grievous error , to strike down the Court which is the guardian of law . The people have the God-given right to make and change their laws , and I should not oppose the call of a conventionto change our Constitution were that not coupled with the avowed will to destroy the Court . I oppose , and will do so with my last breath , any attempt to break a Court , though that attempt be cunningly concealed , for to break a Court or to threaten it with violenceis to destroy the very idea of law and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medicine for the ills of our land , but that medicine must be under law , and it is no medicine to put a dagger in the patient 's heart . Therefore , I disavow the party of Relief , and shall , bend my energies against it so long as it perseveres in its present course . I feel it my duty to announce myself even at this early date as candidate for the Legislaturefrom Pick County , where I now abide , that my poor force may be exerted for what I hold to be right , for thought without action I deem disease of the will , and no virtue . And I feel it my duty , since my name has been long associated with Relief , to write this letter to whoever will deign to read , be he friend or foe . Your humble servant , CASSIUS FORTThat is what Jeremiah read , and then he looked up from it to find Wilkie 's eyes narrowed and glittering , and to hear him say , " Villain p 191and sophist . Oh , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were right  --  and now  --  and now . . Jeremiah , staring into his face , demanded , " What ? What are you saying ? " " The time has come to act , " Wilkie said calmly . " It is your duty , and you ... " " I 'll not be told my duty . I 'll not be played upon . I 'll not be ... " Easy , easy , " Wilkie said , and lightly touched Jeremiah 's arm . " You misunderstand me . I would have you do nothing rash . Only this ... " " What ? " " Do what Madison asked , what you would not do last year . You must run this year , in this county . Against Sellars . " Wilkie was speakingrapidly in a soft voice , very rapidly . " You can win . And you must . But more than that , it is known you were the protege of Fort . Were trained by him . And if you announce for Relief that will have its effect . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have its effect . For we can see to that , I can assure you , and ... " " I will do nothing , " Jeremiah said . " Is it because you are committed to Parham ? Have you signed a contract ? Oh , I begged you not to submit to him . " " I 'll submit to nothing , " Jeremiah burst out . " To no man . Not to him . Or you . " " Why will you do it ? With Parham ? Why ? " " It is my affair . " " Oh , no , Jerry . Not yours . It is the affair of the whole world . Why will you submit to Parham , Jerry ? Why ? " The man in Tupper 's tavern was there before Jeremiah 's face . " My God , " Jeremiah said , " I 'll tell you why . I 'll not have it said I came here to live easy on my wife 's land . I 'll make my way , my own way . Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , repeating , " But why , Jerry , why ? Why will you not run ? " Then before Jeremiah could find words for an answer , he went on , fast and soft : " You are for Relief . Everybodyknows that . And you know Relief is right . You detest Fort . You know he is a villain . And if you forgot and laid aside your former rash resolve . . . " I forgot nothing , " Jeremiah cried out , and felt a fury come , but with it a great weakness so that he trembled . " What do you think I am ? " he demanded . " To swear an oath , and cast it off like a dirty shirt . You do not know me . When I knew Fort had come to Kentucky , rose to go to him . With my whip . To make him fight , to . . . " But did you go ? " Wilkie asked , and smiled again . The fury was gone now , but the weakness remained. p 192 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , as though telling him a secret . " Listen , " Jeremiah managed to say . " Rachel begged me . She begged me , for  --  you see  --  she is going to have a child . " " Ah , " Wilkie said , " ah ! " And then : " And you are happy for that . Oh , I could see in your face when I came that you were happy at last . You were happy when you heard , were n't you , dear Jerry ? " " Yes , I was happy , " Jeremiah said , and for an instant , even now , the happiness flooded back like quietness , here in the room . " You were happy for that , " Wilkie repeated , " like any man . " He studied Jeremiah an instant , then asked , softly again : " But only for that Jerry ? " " What do you mean ? " " I 've said enough , " Wilkie said . " I 've said too much . Forgive me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Say it , by God , " Jeremiah commanded , and stepped toward him . " No , Jerry , " Wilkie said , shaking his head . " By God , you 'll say it ! " Jeremiah exclaimed . " Say it , or I 'll . . . " He had seized Wilkie by the front of his coat , gripping it hard together as though he would crush the body inside . But Wilkie stood perfectly composed in the grasp , with his arms hanging easy at his sides , not resisting . " Oh , Jerry , " he said quietly , almost pityingly , and shook his head . " Say it ! " Jeremiah cried . " Jerry , " Wilkie asked from his calm , " do you really want me to say it ? " " Yes , by God . " " It is only a question , Jerry . Only a question . " " Say it . " " When Rachel told you , " Wilkie almost whispered , " when you knew , you were glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But something else Jerry , something else . Were you glad , too , because now you did not need to go on ? Because now you could escape from an oath which was a burden ? Because now . . . " Jeremiah felt cold at his spine . He heard the words , but they conveyednothing to him . They seemed to come from a great distance . But they were coming yet. . . you could turn your back with-good conscience and seek your private gain in the guise of pride ? In the guise of duty ? And now , when the man you know to be a betrayer has betrayed again , you would turn . . . Then all the words suddenly had their meaning . Jeremiah flung the body back from him , releasing his grip , so that Wilkie staggered back against the secretary. p 193 " Get out , " Jeremiah commanded in a voice that almost strangled him . Wilkie stood by the secretary , looking at him from above his twisted coat and loosened neck-cloth . " Ah , Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you there . " " Get out , " Jeremiah repeated . " It is your house , Jerry , " Wilkie said , but lifted his eyes to indicate the region above stairs . " But Skrogg ? " " When he can ride , " Jeremiah said , " him , tool But now , now I 'll go . I 'll go myself . " So he rushed to the door ; turned there to catch a last glimpse of Wilkie standing in the middle of the floor adjusting his neck-cloth , as calm as though he stood before his mirror at morning ; and then Jeremiah crossed the hall to the front door , and went out . He went across the yard , almost running in his flight , then through the garden , over the stile and into the open fields . But he fled across them , too , they were so wide and open and the light so bright that there he felt undefended from the thousand eyes and a thousand enemies . He reached the woods by the creek , and plunged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , there was not enough shadow and cover . He plunged on , deeper in , and when he stopped at last , there was no sound but his own wrenched breathing . When he came back toward sunset , he passed by the stables and saw that the horses of the guests were gone . He felt relief , and then he was ashamed of the fact . By God , it was his house , he thought . It was his house , but he had had to run away like a beggar or a thief . But as he let himself in the front door , he observed that his hand on the latch was light and that he was moving the door with stealth , and he felt the shame again . By God , it was his house . Then he saw Rachel standing at the head of the stairs , looking down on him . She came down the stairs toward him , and even before she spoke he dreaded what she would say . " What happened ? " she asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though he would go to the library and leave her there in the hall . " It was so strange , " she said . " I heard him in the hall upstairs and thought it was you and came out . But it was n't you , and he was bringing the sick man down . He said they had to leave , and had not wished to trouble me . I asked where you were , and he said you had been called away , that you would be back soon . Then they left , and I did n't know what had happened , where you were or why , and I was afraid , it was so strange . " p 194She had come down the stairs now , and stood before him , with her hand laid on his arm . " What happened ? " she asked . " If you must know , " he said , " we quarreled . " " I knew it . I knew something had happened . Oh , I do n't like him , Jerry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did once , " he said . " Once ? " " Do n't you remember ? " he demanded . " Long back  --  before ... " He had almost said , " before Fort , " but had stopped himself , and said instead : " Before I knew you . " " I scarcely knew him , " she replied . " Well , he liked you . " " I do n't like him , " she said , " and I never did , and ... " Well , I like him . He is my friend , " Jeremiah interrupted with emphasis which surprised even himself . " But you said you had quarreled ? " " It is nothing , " he said . " Nothing , " and withdrew from her touch . " What did you quarrel about ? " " Politics , " he said . Then he stepped back from her . " I 've got some work to do . In the library . I do n't want any supper . " He went into the library and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time afterwards , that she was still standing in the hall . That evening he wrote a note to Wilkie , saying that he would run for the Legislature , and that he would be advised as to the best time to announce his candidacy . Then he wrote another note , also brief . It was to Mr. Parham . He regretted , he said , to abandon a longcherishedproject just at the point of maturity , but a change in his situation made it necessary for him to give over all thoughts of lands in the West . Since Mr. Parham might still be interested in the project , he was sending him all maps , plats and notes with full permission to use them however he thought best . All of that material was in the secretary before him . He now began to sort it and put it in order for making a package . But that took him a long time , for he retraced his courses on the map , and read again the notes he had made , and saw again in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shade of the untouched forest . " I thought of that country where man had not yet come , " he writes , " and how I had stood in its silence , and I asked myself if in going there I had gone not for gain and pride , but for a motive perhaps more base , to flee from my obligation and forget . And I ask myself if all life was a flight , and had I always fled ? " Jeremiah rose to go up to bed , and to Rachel . At the thought of Rachel , he remembered what she had said , how she had scarcely p 195known Wilkie , had never liked him . He stopped all at once in the middle of the floor . But all women liked Wilkie . They always had . Had Rachel lied to him ? Of course not , he told himself , and cursed himself for the thought . If Wilkie had thought that she liked him he had deceived himself . But Wilkie had loved her , or would have loved her had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was strange but true that Wilkie 's love for Rachel had in the end given her to him , to Jeremiah Beaumont . He had the impulse to wake Rachel up and tell her that . He reflectedthat he had never told her exactly how he had heard her story , how Wilkie had railed against the betrayer and how he , Jeremiah , had felt nothing until Wilkie had accused him of being an intimate and confidant , even a kind of accomplice , of the betrayer . He supposed that he had never told her , and had answered her questions with evasions and half-truths , because he was ashamed of his own sluggish spirit that had only been aroused to justice by an unjust accusation . He reflected now that he should be grateful to Wilkie for the unjust accusation . Only through suffering injustice , he thought , do we grasp at the idea of justice . There is little record of the next several months and the period of the campaign , at least in so far as Jeremiah himself is concerned . His candidacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not announceduntil late May , when his crops were already in . But the late date was political strategy , and not a farmer 's prudence : the candidacywould come as something of a surprise and the late announcementwould give the Anti-Relief party less time to recover and plan its attack on him . There would be a bitter campaign he knew . Mr Parham would never forgive him for dropping the land project , and already young Felix Parham had talked in the taverns of the county when he had his whisky in him . It was a bitter campaign , but the very bitterness became a kind of intoxication for Jeremiah . He knew , he reports , that slander was abroad against him , but he had determined to make no reply unless it came direct to him . Then he would make the " only reply possible to manhood . " Meanwhile , he discovered that his own partisans had a weapon against old Parham . The tale was afloat that old Parham had tried to buy him off with a rich partnership for land speculation but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became clear . When he first encountered the tale , his impulse was to deny it , to explain the whole situation . But how could you explain it ? It meant explaining so much , his whole life , really . So he had to suffer a sense of embarrassment and guilt at his silent conniving in the lie . But he did ask Wilkie point-blank if he had set the tale afloat , and p 196when Wilkie blandly accepted the responsibility , Jeremiah hotly reproachedhim . " Why , dear Jerry , " Wilkie said , " you do n't understand the world . It takes the ground from under old Parham 's feet . It draws his fangs . " " But it 's not true ! " Jeremiah protested . " Oh , it is true , all right , " Wilkie said . " I told you long back he was trying to buy you . " " But I took the idea to him , I initiated the whole ... " " What you thought does not matter , " Wilkie said pityingly . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore on , hot and sultry , with tempers shorter and shorter , and the news of the outbreak of violence in one county fanningthe outbreak in another . August was drawing on , and the elections . He was almost grateful for the last excitements and occupations . They took him out of himself and the heaviness of his thoughts at home . For the early happiness which had come with Rachel 's announcement that she was to have a child had almost vanished , or it returned fitfully , not to be depended upon , no longer the climate in which he could move and breathe . After his decision to enter the race , he had not told Rachel for two or three weeks . When he did tell her , she said nothing . She only nodded in assent , but the heaviness of her face touched him . A week later , he woke to find her weeping in the night . But he feigned sleep , and lay by her side quietly until the fit had worn itself out . He had almost forgotten that event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at breakfast he remarked casually that the next day he would announce . Her face went white , her lips trembled , and without answering she looked down at her coffee cup . For a moment he thought that she had had an attack of nausea from her condition , and rose and went to her and put his hands on her shoulders . But when she lifted her face to him , he knew the truth , even before she spoke . " They 'll take you away , " she said huskily . " They 'll take you away from me . Oh , ca n't they leave us alone ! " He murmured something comforting , saying that she was overwrought , that her condition made her nervous , that he loved her and her alone and would do so forever . But she twisted from under his touch saying , " Oh , you 'll leave me. you 'll leave me . " He tried to explain that during the campaign he would never be away long at a time , just in the county , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to Frankfort . At that , a look of real terror swept over her face , and for a moment she could not speak . Then she said , " Never  --  I 'd never go . I ca n't go . I ca n't . And you  --  you 'll leave me . I know they 'll take you away . " p 197He tried to soothe her . He said that she had been long out of the world , that their life had been unnatural and cut off with only the stupid Marlowes and Negroes for companionship , that a man had to play his part in the world , that they had to live in the world , for the child 's sake if nothing more . " I hate the world , " she cried out . " And the world  --  it will take you away ! " He could do nothing with her , and in the end he left the room with a cold knot in his heart where there had been tenderness . For some days she was distant and listless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing wrong , the doctor said , and went away . Then came the quarrel . It came upon some triviality . Later he could not even remember its occasion . They were quickly reconciled . He was sure that they were reconciled , and for a little he was happier than he had been for months . He left immediately on his political business , and for his two days of absence , he longed to get back to her . Within an hour after his return , which had been as perfect as he had hoped , they had quarreled again , and again for no reason which he could determine . Suddenly he discovered that a pattern had been set . He found her bright and cheerful at morning and at noon distant and absorbed . Or at morning she woke sunk in some black , inner despair , unwilling to turn her face to him on the pillow , and if she took his kiss he felt that he was kissing a dead face . Then when he returned in the evening , full of foreboding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions about the business of the day , ready to read to him or play for him on the harpsichord in the parlor . All at once he knew that these times were the worst of all . The smile was a mask ready to fall from her face . Her questions were hollow with the abstracted politeness of a bored stranger , and her eyes wanderedwhen he attempted to answer . Two or three times , when she was reading to him , she read the same line over again without knowingit , and he knew that she had been reading with her mind far away in some desolate spot . Once , in the middle of a piece of music , she burst into tears and ran from the room and locked the door of the bedroom so that he could not come to her . These times , which were a travesty of their old happiness , became horrible . He came to dread the brittle smile on her face more than her reproaches or desolation . At least , those things , the reproaches or desolation were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the smile was some thin crust , like ice , over a more terrifying mystery . He would wait for the mask to fall or the crust to break , and if that did not happen the waiting became intolerable , for he knew that it would happen . So he found himself , in the end , speaking some word or p 198performing some . act to precipitate the crisis . " For , " as he was to write of that time , " it is what is not real that we can not bear , who can bear reality no matter if it wear the Gorgon face to freeze the human heart to stone . " But he adds : " I do not say this to excuse the evil I did to her , for it is the sadness of love that one who can not find the reality of himself cries out most for the reality of her whom he loves and if he finds less than that truth in its fullness he feels himself betrayed , and one drop of that vinegar will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick than a thunder-clap . " But even so , there came now and then , without warning , outside the pattern of things and beyond any expectations , the moments when she was completely the self of their old intimate life , when the smile she turned upon him was real , and when she stepped to a window in the morning and took the first sun on her face and laughed and turned to him to say , look , the day is beautiful , or when she held her chicks in her lap , sitting on the grass under a tree and leaning above them . At those moments , all the disorder of the past would seem to have been an evil dream spun out of some darkness in himself . But the moment would pass , and when the pattern had reaffirmed itself more vindictively than before , he would wonder which had been the dream , the happiness or the unhapppiness , the good or the evil . Or in the middle of the night she might reach over to touch his hand , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pride or her hopelessness would not let her take his hand in daylight or when he was awake . At those times he would lie as asleep , to avoid the shame of surprising her in the act or to cling himself to the illusion of trust evoked by her act and to steal this moment of happiness outside the whole circuit of their life . But one night the thought crossed his mind : " What does she seek from me ? " Whatever it was , he knew that he had not given , and could not give it . And that thought robbed him of the last illusion , and ' left him lying panting and rigid in the dark . Therefore he flung himself more ferociously than before into the life of the violent world outside . That , too , was an illusion , he began to think , a kind of " mock-show " or " play-party , " he called it . Strangely enough , once that conviction had come , he could smile more readily into any face , the flattering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falsely to his lips , good-fellowship came more quickly at the whisky barrel , and when he stood before a crowd to speak he found without effort now the warm phrases which inflamedpassion or soothed vanity . He felt that he had stumbled on a great and comic secret : if you knew that the hurly-burly of the world was a mock-show , and a flight from another more dire mock-show , then you could play your part the better to win applause from all. p 199At Smileytown , just as he was about to mount the steps of the store to speak , an old man , whom he knew to be a Reliefer , plucked at his sleeve , saying , " I done been up to Frankfort , and a man ast me if I did n't come from down this-a-way , and give this to me . I thought you 'd want to see it , about that son-of-a-bitch . " Jeremiah took the crumpled paper , and smiled , and thanked the man , and slapped him on the shoulder ( " I slapped on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not knowing " ) , and stepped to the porch . He thrust the paper into his pocket and began to speak . Hours later , as he undressed for bed in a strange room in the house of a farmer near Smileytown , he found the paper . It was a campaign broadside : THE TRUTH ABOUTCOLONEL CASSIUS FORTOne truth is known to all , that this man who now pulls and preens before us , and speaks for wealth and pride of place , though himself a hireling risen from the mire by arts of connivance , was once the king-pin and master of Relief , and captured hearts with his eloquent tongue that pled for Justice . Oh , be not deceived by him . Oh , hearken not to that eloquence now bought and sold for a price to plead for Injustice . Oh , know that he is a traitor , and betrayed for thirty pieces of silver and the flattery of the Pharisee . That truth is known to all . But there is a truth not known , which should be blazoned forth to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives a public lie had stooped in private to betray the precious trust and innocence of a female heart and all for foul appetite . Be it known that this seducer with smooth tongue and false fatherly kindness lured to his embrace a worthy lady of Saul County , by name Miss Rachel Jordan , and that when she had come heavy with the fruit of his lust he cast her off . What shall we say of him who is traitor to both private oath and public trust ? Who treads with equal ease upon the poor man 's hope and the female 's heart ? Who is one mass of corruption through and through , and makes the sweet air of heaven stink ? There in the room alone , holding the paper in his hand , Jeremiah felt deprived and stripped , and the walls seemed to fall away to leave him sorely exposed . He burned the broadside by the candle flame , then quickly blew out the light . The elections occurred in August . There were the fifes and drums and fiddles in the square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cock-fights and the horse-run , the brawling and singing and scuffling , the Negroes playing Old Sledge and mumble-the-peg in the shade and drinking and whacking on gourd banjos , the gingerbreadand apple sellers screaming their wares , the young folks dancingin the glade down by the creek and sneaking off in couples into the cover of the woods , the chaffing and guffawing , the drunkards lying on the pavement with wide mouths snoring , to be stepped over by the citizenry who could still stand . There was Sellars on his fine horse , bulging in a new black coat , with red-dyed goose feathers set around the band of his beaver , leading his parade with banners around and around the square , bowing and sweating and smiling to the sound of his music . Jeremiah rode , too , to the sound of fiddles and the cheers of Reliefers , around and around the square , smiling and smiling , or stood by the whisky barrel and shook every hand . Oh , he knew what the world was . But Sellars won the election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the second day , the result became clear well before the polls were closed . Jeremiah walked quietly about the square , thanking the men who had done most to further his campaign , and then found his horse and rode away . He was certain that nobody saw him go , or cared . There was some comfort in that . It was over . He was not to know for three days that there had been a terrible fight in the square at the end , with blood freely let and one man dead with a knife in his belly . Well , that was part of the world . But he was out of it now . It was late , long after dark , when he got home . He saw a light in the library as he rode up the lane , and wondered idly why it had been left there . It never occurred to him that Rachel would be waiting up for him . But she was . She was lying on the couch now set with its back to the dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candlestick on a little table at the head of the couch throwing the light down across her hair and bosom . He noticed the mound of her pregnancy and was about to ask how she felt , when she spoke . " Were you . . . ? " she began . He cut short her question . " You need n't worry , " he said . " I was n't elected . " " I 'm sorry , " she said . " I 'm not . It is probably all for the best . " " Do you want something to eat ? " she asked . " I had something set for you in case ... " " In case I lost , " he finished for her . Then : " So you expected me to lose ? " p 201But the bitterness of his words was wasted , and when he had spoken , even before he saw that she would not respond to it , he knew that he did not feel the bitterness . He felt nothing . He had spoken thus simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been caught . She regarded him soberly from her distance ( he had not approached the couch ) , and then said : " No , you must not believe that . I could have no opinion of what might happen . " " I 'm not hungry , " he said , and sat down in a chair some distance from the couch . They sat there for some time , not speaking , while the candles burned down to nubs . That night defined a new stage for their relationship . The old tensionwas broken . But there was no return now of their former passion or affection . Each went through the day , respecting the distance between them , careful not to cross it , careful to speak only of the trivial affairs of the present without reference to past or future , speaking in even voices when there was something to say , capable of long silence when there was nothing . Jeremiah says that that time made him think of what old age must be like when two people have outlived all their love and their hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faults so well that the faults no longer have meaning , and old resentments are no more than the accustomed pain of a rheumatic joint , part of the nature of things , when they can live in peace because neither is more than a ghost to the other . But he was to young to accept that peace without hope . He found that in some secret corner he was thinking of the time when the child should come . Life would begin again then . He did not try to previsionwhat that life would be like , but he and Rachel could share it . He tried to put the hope away , superstitiously dreading that if he acknowledged it , it would come to nothing . Then it happened . When he stepped into the hall , upon returning home one afternoon in late October , he saw Old Josie 's face staring down at him from the stairs , and even before she spoke his heart was chilled . " It 's her , " Old Josie said , " it 's her . " And Jeremiah bounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran to the bedroom . Rachel lay in the bed , on her back , with her eyes closed . For an instant , he thought that she was dead , but then , as he leaned over her , he saw that she was breathing . He called her name , twice , but she did not respond . Then he heard Josie , and turned . " She yell out , " Josie said . " She yell loud , and I come and seen her
