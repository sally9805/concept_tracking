When Meier &; Frank , the biggest department store ( and the biggest advertiser ) in Portland , Ore. , was charged with unfair labor practices last fall , neither the morning Portland Oregonian ( circ. 214,916 ) nor the rival evening Oregon Journal ( circ. 190,844 ) covered the story . Both papers privately said that it was merely an oversight , that they would report the National Labor Relations Board 's final decision in the case in full ( TIME , Oct. 31 ) . <P> Fortnight ago , when the NLRB ruled on the charges against Meier &; Frank , both the Oregonian and the Journal printed the news . The Oregonian gave an eminently fair report of the issues and rulings in the case , covering both the charges of which M &; F was found innocent and those on which it was found guilty . The Journal also touched all the bases , but its report was briefer , less prominently displayed , and kinder to the store . <P> After the stories appeared , the store canceled 14 pages of ads in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the M &; F advertising budget to one page , while continuing to take as many as four or five in the Journal . To the Oregonian , that meant a loss of an estimated $8,000 a week , and it began to lay off printers . <P> Breaking the story in the nearby Salem Oregon Statesman ( circ. 15,798 ) , Republican ex-Governor Charles A. Sprague last week charged M &; F with trying to dictate the editorial policies of the press . He also pointed a moral : " Accusations of newspaper subservience to advertisers have been freely made in late years , particularly by left-wingers and New Dealers ... An incident like this plays right into their hands . . . " <P> At week 's end , M &; F 's President Aaron Frank had still not relented , and the Oregonian ( which lost its M &; F ads once before when it opposed Julius Meier for governor ) was not backing down either . Though it was beginning to feel the financial pinch , the 100-year-old paper defied M &; F in a Page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Oregonian strives to report the news completely , impartially and without fear or favor . The Oregonian will continue to do so . "
