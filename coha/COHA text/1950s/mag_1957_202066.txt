Which is harder on the heart-work or leisure ? This question got the full-dress treatment last week by 70 specialists from the U.S. , Britain , Canada , Germany , Sweden and Finland , gathered in Milwaukee for a conference* on work and the heart . From studies designed to find out how much work a man can safely do after a heart attack , they developed some startling facts . <P> Drs . Amasa B. Ford and Herman K. Hellerstein of Cleveland 's Western Reserve University noted that by far the most strenuous of all human activity is " play " - carried to the extreme of championship athletics . When energy expenditure is measured by the rate of calorie consumption , a distance runner or skier can burn up 26.5 calories per minute ; healthy young men at amateur sports can work up to a fuel consumption of 18 calories per minute . The heaviest rates for steady work have been reported for coal miners as ranging from 4.3 to 5 calories per minute . <P> The Cleveland researchers studied men doing a wide range of jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a light-metals plant , found that their average energy consumption during working hours was only 1.97 calories per minute . This means that the workers spent less energy on the job than they did off the job-because it has been shown that during eight nonworking waking hours an average worker will burn up calories at a rate of 2.96 per minute . <P> Fatal Flight . With such facts in mind , Dr. William Dock of the Palo Alto medical clinic lashed out at the tendency to attribute a man 's death from heart disease to his work , regardless of other activities . He cited a case history : " An electrician , two years after recovery from a heart attack dropped dead at lunch , which had included two bottles of beer . The industrial examiner accepted the claim that death was due to the exertion of walking up a flight of stairs an hour before lunch , and refused to consider that a stomach full of iced beer was a far worse stress and probably caused ventricular fibrillation . It was also known that the electrician played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his wife at least four times each week , but it was the occupational flight of stairs , not these other and far greater stresses , which was accepted as fatal . " <P> Heart Specialist Dock noted that coughing and contracting the abdominal muscles during bowel movements " impose burdens analogous to those caused by lifting heavy objects . . . Less severe but more sustained circulatory stress is imposed by sexual intercourse . . . Pulse rate is nearly doubled , the heart 's output per beat is increased nearly 50% , and systolic pressure rises about 30% even in orgasms induced by masturbation , with less emotional or physical stress . This circulatory effect is comparable to that caused by running up two or three flights of stairs , while in intercourse the effect may be two or three times more severe or prolonged .
