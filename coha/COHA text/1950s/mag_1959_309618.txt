The world 's busiest museum director may well be boyish Karl Katz at Bezalel National . Museum in Israel . In a sense , Bezalel 's collection was built as Israel itself was built-by the patriotic zeal of Jews the world over . Since its founding 53 years ago , Jewish collectors have sent Bezalel some 250,000 art objects of every conceivable kind , making it the richest and most diversified general museum in the Middle East . <P> Beginning with Garbage . Katz 's own cluttered office is like a miniature of the museum as a whole . Among its jumble lie a death mask of Modigliani , Japanese sword-guards , English portrait miniatures , an Etruscan gold fibula , the earliest known Passover haggada , an uncut diamond shaped like the star of David , and a 15th century Hebrew anthology lavishly illuminated and valued at $500,000 . The office shelves are ranged with Egyptian glassware . Persian ceramics and Hellenistic sculptures . On the wall is a never-exhibited triptych by Bernado Daddi . Recently a museum staffer turned up a unique Egyptian figurine , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This kind of thing happens all the time , " Katz purrs , " and we still have a number of unexcavated desks . " <P> Since taking over as director two years ago , Katz has almost finished the prodigious task of cataloguing the collection , between times has scurried across Europe and the U.S. seeking money for a new $2,000,000 building with room to display the treasures now consigned to storerooms in the present old mansion in Jerusalem . By last week he had accumulated enough money to order preliminary plans , had picked a site on a breezy ridge just outside the city , hopes to break ground this September . <P> Katz , 29 , has excavated far more than desks . Born and raised in Brooklyn , he proved himself an archaeologist at heart while still a boy , when he first noticed that his mother always disposed of the garbage in neat paper parcels . Wondering what family secrets garbage might be presumed to hold , Katz patrolled the block every evening , collecting samples from each can . Back home in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how the neighbors lived . " In archaeology , " he says , " the garbage is older . " <P> Room for the Best . Katz got his formal training at Flatbush Hebrew Institute and Columbia ( where he specialized in early Islamic manuscripts and modern art ) . A stint at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Museum , followed by intensive digging throughout the Middle East , helped temper Katz for his Jerusalem post , which would try the energy and scholarship of a dozen ordinary men . <P> Aware that Israel is both very old and very new , Katz keeps sending his ancient treasures on tour and clearing his own limited wall space for loan exhibitions of contemporary work . On view at Bezale last week : traveling shows of prints and paintings from the U.S. and Norway " They used to call Jerusalem the navel of the world , " says Katz in his intense , buzz-saw voice . " What better place for a museum that brings together the best art of all periods and peoples ? "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
