THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment THAT long-winded lady we hear from occasionally has got herself involved with subterranean trans portation this winter , on which she re  --  ports as follows : " I come in to town for a round of the shops once in a while , and last Wednesday evening , after an unex  --  pectedly agreeable day with the new chemise dresses , I was on the A train , riding up to 168th Street , where I catch the bus that takes me out to my present home , in Palisades . There were no seats to he had , but I had a good grip on the pole at the end of one of the seats and I was reading the beauty column of the Journal-ilmerican , which the man next to me was holding up in front of him . All of a sudden / felt a tap on my arm , and I looked down and there was a man beginning to stand up from the seat where he was sitting . Would you like to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first thing that came into my head , I was so surprised and pleased to he offered a seat in the sub  --  way . ' Oh , thank you very much , ' I said , ' but I am getting nut at the next station . ' He sat back and that was that , but I felt all set up and I thought what a nice man he must be and I wondered what his wife was like and I thought how lucky she was to have such a polite husband , and then all of a sudden I realized that I was n't getting out at the next station at all but the nne after that , and I felt perfectly terrible , I decided to get out at the next station anyway , but then I thought , If I get out at the next station and wait around for the next train I 'll miss my bus and they only go every hour and that will be perfectly silly . So I decided to bra  --  zen it out as best I could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station I stared at the man until I caught his eye and then I said , ' I just remembered this is n't my station after all . ' Then I thought he would think I was asking him to stand up and give me his seat , so I said , ' But I still do n't want to sit down , because I 'm getting off at the next station . ' I showed him by my expression that I thought it was all rather funny , and he smiled , more or less , and nodded , and lifted his hat and put it back on his head again and looked away . He was one of those small , rather glum or sad men who al  --  ways look off into the distance after they have finished what they are say  --  ing , when they speak . felt quite proud of my strong-mindedness at not get  --  ting off the train and missing my bus simply because of the fear of a little em  --  barrassment , but just as the train was shutting its doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh dear ! ' I said . ' That was my station and now I have missed the bus ! ' I was fit to he tied , and I had spoken quite loudly , and f felt chagrined beyond belief , and extreme  --  ly foolish , and I looked down , and the man who had offered me his seat was partly looking at me , and I said , ' Now , is n't that silly ? That was my station . A Hundred and Sixty-eighth Street is where I 'm supposed to get off . I must have left m ) wits at Lord &; Taylor . ' I could n't help laughing , it was all so awful , and he looked away , and the train fidgeted along to the next sta  --  tion , and I got off as quickly as I pos  --  sibly could and tore over to the down  --  town platform and got a local to 168th , but of course I had missed my bus by a minute , or maybe two minutes . I felt very much at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally went into a rudely appointed but friendly bar and had a Martini , warm but very soothing , which only cost me fifty cents . While I was sipping it , trying to make it last to exactly the moment that would get me a good place in the bus queue without having to stand too long in the cold , I wondered what I should have done about that man in the subway . After all , if I had taken his seat I probably would have got out at 168th Street , which would have meant that I would hardly have been sitting down before I would have been getting up again , and that would have seemed odd . And rather grasping of me . And he would n't have got his seat hack , because some other grasping per  --  son would have slipped into it ahead of him when I got up . He seemed a retiring sort of man , not pushy at all . I hesitate to think of how he must have regretted offering me his seat . Some  --  times it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " On the Seesaw WE learned quite a bit about Stock- bridge , Massachusetts , the chanci  --  ness of playwriting , and William Gib  --  son , the author of " Two for the Seesaw , " in the course of an interview with Mr. Gibson in an apartment on Central Park West one day last week . When we called on him , accompanied by a young lady who is one of the heaters for his play , we found him en sconced in the cozy , dimly lighted living room of the apartment , together with his wife , Margaret . Mr. Gibson turned out to he a tall , tweedy man with gray  --  ing hair and formidable black eyebrows ; in contrast , Mrs. Gibson is a small woman ( five feet one , to her husband 's six one ) , whose general appearance  --  short hair , heavy sweater , wool skirt , knee-length socks , and flat-heeled shoes  --  reminded us quite a lot of the heroine of " Two for the Seesaw , " a Bronx gamin with ulcers and heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened , the young lady who had come along with us had told us earlier that her name was Gittel , and had rolled her blue eyes several times in appreciation of the coincidence . Our Gittel sat in a corner during our talk ; Mrs. Gibson curled up on an over  --  stuffed couch ; Mr. Gibson settled down in an easy chair ; and we made do with a dining-room extra . After identifying Mrs. Gibson as a practicing psychoanalyst , Mr. Gibson told us that Stockbridge  --  a town of two thousand souls  --  is a great place for life , scenery , and children , and is the headquarters of the Austen Riggs Cen  --  ter for the study and treatment of psy  --  choneurosis . Mrs. Gibson , he added , is on the staff of Austen Riggs and is a training analyst for the ' Western New England Psychoanalytic Institute . Warming to his subject , Mr Gibson continued , " Stockbridge is what you would call an intimate place , where everything is concentrated . I guess I ought to point out that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from my friend William Inge for a couple of days . I ca n't wait to get back to Stock  --  bridge to work on a novel I began last summer . I want to work in the one-man form . I miss myself . I 've lived in Stockbridge for ten years , come this summer , and we get to New York ten or twelve times a year , which is enough for me . We live in a good , middle-class house that is about thirty years old and has thirteen rooms , all of them used . I work on top of a nearby hill , in a one-room studio , which I built with the help of a friend . Took us seven weeks , and I 've still got an aching back . The studio has one wall of solid glass . Absolutely terrific . It has a couch , a desk half painted and half unpainted , and a verb comfortable swivel chair . I write in longhand , on those pads of yellow paper with lines on them , and then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our first visit to New York since the day the play opened , a month ago . We left town the next day , and I immediately came down with the flu . The next day Henry Fonda , our star , came down with it . What a nightmare ! We never expected a hit of this kind -- not a smash , anyway . " " Sold out through June , " our Gittel muttered , in her corner . Mrs. Gibson jumped up from the couch and reached for a brown-paper package on a coffee table . " Let 's take a look at the Sylvania prize , honey , " she said . Mr. Gibson opened the package , and we all looked at the prize in silence . " It 's a clack ! " Mrs. Gibson finally exclaimed . " It 's inscribed , ' For out  --  standing contribution to creative tele  --  vision technique ? " The Miracle Work  --  er " ? William Gibson . ' " " Now all we need is a picture tube for the television set back home in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ally , that play , which was about Helen Keller , is the only thing I 've ever writ  --  ten for television . I 've been a serious writer since I was nineteen . I was born in the Bronx in 1914 ; Margaret was born in Denver in 1918 . All the kids knew in the Bronx were Irish . Mar  --  garet , here , is Jewish , and she has never lived in the Bronx . Ironic . We met in Jamaica , Queens , when we were kids . Both our families had moved there . We 've been married eighteen years and have two boys , one and a half and four and a half years old . I met my wife at a party or something . " " New Year 's Eve party , 1937 , " Mrs. Gibson said , tugging up her socks . Mr. Gibson then informed us that his father was of English ancestry , had been a clerk at the Chase Na tional Bank for twenty-five years , and died at the age of fifty . His mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children , only two of whom were girls . " Four of her brothers were the best banjo players in the country , " he an nounced proudly . " When my Uncle Willie died , the equivalent of V a ricer at the time ran a headline that said , ' The King of the Banjos Is Dead . ' My mother lives in Bellerose , Long Island , and she prayed to Saint Anthony for Two for the Seesaw ' all through re hearsals . The original title of ' See saw ' was ' After the Verb to Love . ' Nobody liked it except me . I wanted to use a quote about Love in the play , and Found one in Bartlett , attributed to some German baroness . It was long and wordy , so I rewrote it to read , After the verb to love , to help is the sweetest in the tongue . ' " We asked Mr. Gibson about his forma tive years , and he told us that he had attended Townsend Harris Hall , " a school for three-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College , where he was unhappy with practically all his courses except English Literature , which was taught by Theodore Good man . " He was my mentor , " said Mr. Gibson . After leaving college in his jun ior year and writing a play about the depression which was , he says , awful , Mr. Gibson did a bit of acting with the Barter Theatre , in Abingdon , Virginia , and then , when Mrs. Gibson  --  his fi  --  ancee at the time  --  went to Topeka to work in the children 's division of the Menninger Clinic , he headed West with her , married , and got a job as a piano player in a place called the Blue Moon Cafd . " I wrote my second play , which , strangely enough , had a beer joint as its locale , and was full of rape and violence , in Topeka , " said Mr. Gibson . " My wife started carving out a brilliant career for herself at Menninger 's , and got analyzed there . Not me . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to write a novel . I used to think it would take twenty-five years to write a novel . I wrote a lot of lyric pnt:try with case , but I would sit all day over half a sentence for a novel . How  --  ever , I finally did finish one , M-G-M bought it for a movie . It was called ' The Cobweb , ' and was ostensibly about a pair of curtains but actually about a mental-disease hospital , patients , doc  --  tors , and so on . We used our M-G-M money to buy our house in Stockbridge . I 've written five unproduced plays . One of them  --  about three days in the life of Shakespeare , and how he comes to desert his wife and run off with a hum to London  --  has been optioned so often I 've made five thousand dollars out of it . It 's a very poetic kind of play . I wrote it originally for a five-hundred  --  dollar contest sponsored by the Topeka Civic Theatre . I was a member , and etiquette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother-in-law 's name and won the contest . Created quite ea scandal when they discovered I was the real author . We had an amateur pro  --  duction of the play at the University of Kansas in 1947 . That 's where I met Bill Inge . I have Gittel 's stomach ulcers , by the way . People are always asking me how I got the name Gittel . " " My name is Gittel , " said our Gittel , from her corner . " True to life , eh ? " said Mr. Gibson , beaming . ? FAR EASTERN INTELLIGENCE : There 's a hat shop on Motomachi Street , Yokohama , that bears the sign " Urbi et Orbi  --  Millinery . " Island for Sale WHEN we learned last week that the federal government intends to put Ellis Island on the block at an auction scheduled for February 14th , we decided to take a last look at the place before it changed hands . First , though , we sought out a real-estate man we know who keeps himself in  --  formed about parcels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and asked him what he thought Ellis is worth . " Hard to say , hard to say , " he re  --  marked . " When it was put up for sale in 1956 , it had an estimated value of six million dollars , but President Eisenhow  --  er stopped the sale before any cash was advanced to prove or disprove the worth of that estimate . I 've heard talk of the island 's being converted into an amuse  --  ment center , a warehouse site , a place for industrial exhibitions , a luxury hous  --  ing development , and even a college campus . But I do n't think there 's any real commercial interest . Probably take somewhere around ten million to make it fit for any of these particular projects . In fact , it would take so much to make it fit for any project that I 'd be surprised if the highest hid went beyond a measly hundred thousand . There 's a congress  --  man who wants to make it the head  --  quarters for a national lottery , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wanted to make it over into a recreation center and ethnic mu  --  seum . Right now , I 'd say that people like Frank Hogan , Jacob javits , and Irving Ives , who want to buy the island as a she for a hospital for narcotic ad  --  dicts , probably have the most practical idea . " We thanked our real-estate man and headed for Pier 9 , where the Coast Guard has a launch that serves as a ferry for Ellis Island maintenance crews . Once aboard the launch , we fell in with a tall , middle-aged colored man , who identified himself as Raymond Thomp  --  son , maintenance engineer of the instal  --  lations on the island . " Going to bounce a little on the way over , and it sure looks cold out there on the water , " he said as we got under way . Mr. Thompson was right on both counts , and we were shiv  --  ering and unstable on our feet when the red , gray , and green of the island 's buildings  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the spray . " We 'll go to the powerhouse first , " said Mr. Thompson , on landing . We entered one of the buildings and followed him down a long passageway to the welcome warmth of the boiler room . " Better take your coat off or you wo n't get any benefit from it when we go round the island , " he said . " You know , as late as 1954 there were thirty-eight men working full time in the powerhouse . Now there are only ten of us . We 've got hair boilers  --  two new ones , installed in 1947 , and a couple of old-timers , from 1917 , that were rebuilt in 19311 and again in 1947 . We keep heat in all the buildings on First Island , and a little heat seeps through to part of the hospital on Second . Still call them First , Second , and Third Islands , because they used to he separate before the government brought them all together by dumping rock in the spaces between them . " He glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a look around . Before we left the boiler room , he pointed to a white cat dozing on the floor . " That old beast belonged to the last director , but they could n't find her when he left , in 1954 , " he said . " Turned up a few days later , and she 's been here ever since . " We trailed Mr. Thompson as he led us through the huge buildings , where as many as five thousand immigrants used to be in residence , waiting to be cleared for entry into the United States 1 . Ve wandered through kitchens , laundries , and rooms where aliens had been classi  --  fied , fed , amused , imprisoned . A few light bulbs served , with the help of an occasional ray of sunlight , to illuminate FEBRUARY 15 , 9 5 8 funny , with New York a mile and a half away and Jersey only a few hundred feet away . Summers are still nice out here , but the win  --  ters can get morbid . I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make decent use of the place . " the dusty rooms . " You 'll see a lot of paint coming off , and that seemed to make the real-estate men most unhap  --  py , " said Mr. Thompson as we went . along . " But when you buy a ship , you do n't look at the paint . You stick a knife into the wood . These buildings are O.K. Every one of them on a foun  --  dation that rests on concrete piles . " In one corner of a great room where warrant cases ( stowaways and people who had tried to jump ship ) were held , a few rusty beds still remained , with mattresses rolled up at their feet . We went on to the passenger hall  --  another enormous room and noticed a sign ly ing on one of the desks left behind when the Immigration Department moved out . It read , " No Smoking , Rauchen Verboten , Vietato Fumare , Palenie Ty  --  toniu Wzbronione , Prohibido Fumar . " " This used to he a really crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it done up nicely , with bright paint , good fur  --  niture , television , radio , and ping-pong tables . Up on the balcony they had rooms for single girls . " Vie went up  --  stairs , through thirty-five rooms that had been family quarters , and into an old dining room , which had been turned into a chapel and library . Three aged upright pianos and a small organ were ranged along the walls . Next door was a school-and-playroom , corn Otte with a sandbox , and farther along we came upon the " cabin section , " equipped with barred cells , where people about to be deported had been kept . Mr. Thomp  --  son then led us to the hospital , which was abandoned in 1948 and looks very dilapidated . " You would n't believe bow this place has changed , " said Mr. Thompson . " Out in front , there were gardens . The lawns were beautiful in summer , with flowers and park benches . Ed Sullivan 's wife used to he in charge of recreation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Thompson said he 'd better be getting hack to his boiler room , and , after tak  --  ing a turn outside and watching some gulls riding an oily swell toward the Statue of Liberty , only a few yards away , we rejoined our guide . " Been here since 1942 , and I still think it 's a pretty fine place most of the time , " said Mr. Thompson . " I live in jersey now , but I have to go back through Manhattan and up across the George Washington Bridge to get home . Seems Prophecy OUR favorite high-school girl of the year  --  thus far , at least  --  is one we 've been told about by a correspondent in far-off Birmingham , Ala  --  bama . It seems that the high schools there an  --  nually sponsor a spring festival , and , accord  --  ingly , a meeting was held last week to discuss plans for this year 's project and choose a motif around which to drape the hunting and the streamers of crepe paper . When the stu  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as a possible theme for the festival , girl thought it over and said , " Oh , afraid everybody will be tired of by May . " End Man ONE of the most famous names in the country is to undergo a radical change on the first of the month , when Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Beane becomes Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Smith . What the name loses in provocativeness the explosive , easily rhymed climax provided by " Beane " has long been a boon to writers of songs and gags  --  it makes up for in appropri  --  ateness , because the Smith in question has been more or less running the show for the past fifteen years , and it 's high time he was given public recognition . Mr. Smith , whose first name is Win  --  throp , shares with the late Charles Merrill the chief credit for having made Merrill Lynch , etc. , the largest stockbrokerage house in the world , with a hundred and twenty-four offices throughout this country and abroad , and four hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous , indeed , that it has two fa mous nicknames ; in tribute to its lengthy countdown of founding partners , the firm is often called the Thundering Herd , and in tribute to its tireless ad  --  vertising campaign to " broaden the base of stock ownership , " it is called We the People . The change of name having been decided on late in December , the firm has had plenty of time to prepare to carry it nut . It orders only a two-month supply of stationery at a time , so by March 1st there will be few Beane let  --  terheads left and a full stock of Smithson hand . The firm mails out around three anda half million copies of various pub-c a t ions  --  stock-m a rk et appraisals , com  --  ments on companies , promotional pam  --  phlets , and so on  --  in the course of a year , and the Beane ones will be allowed to run out gradually as the Smith ones come in . As for those hundred and twenty-four offices , the firm name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times in every last one of them . Luckily , the names Beane and Smith contain the same number of letters , so it will be comparatively simple for the sign paint  --  ers to scratch out the one and paint in the other , at an average cost of two hundred and fifty dollars per office . The firm is relieved that its name is nowhere cut in stone or cast in bronze ; the most expensive single change will be at a Merrill Lynch office in Chicago , where a neon Beane must give way to a neon Smith , at two hundred dollars a letter . We 've been down to Wall Street  --  really Pine Street  --  to examine the Smith who has been responsible for this sudden burst of international activity , and can report that he is a bespectacled , chubby-faced man of sixty-four , with a shy , pleasant manner . " I was in Florida when the decision was reached , " he told us . " Mr. Beane , son of the original Beane , had resigned , and my partners got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my name in lights . Naturally , I 'm very flattered . There are n't many old-timers like me left in the firm . " Born in South Hadley Falls , Massachusetts , Mr. Smith attended Andover and Amherst , and went to work for the original firm of Merrill Lynch &; Co. in 1916- In 1930 , when Charles Merrill , its head , decided to quit the hrnkeragn business in favor of investment banking , Smith and a num  --  ber of other junior partners went over to the brokerage house of E. A. Pierce &; Co. , along with some five million dol  --  lars of capital supplied by Mr. Mer  --  rill . In 1940 , Smith persuaded Merrill to return to stockbrokerage and merge Merrill Lynch with Pierce . A year later , the wire house of Fen ? ner &; Beane entered the bulging fold . " When the new firm was started , the market was pretty dull , " Mr. Smith said . " Charlie Merrill and I were con  --  vinced that our business would grow in proportion to the growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investor .

We 've always urged him to invest his extra dollars . Savings and life insurance should come first . " Mr. Smith is a trustee of Amherst , Mount Holyoke , and Colby , and a Yankee fan . He is married , has three sons , and spends his summer vacations and occasional week  --  ends at a farm in Connecticut . " For years and years , I worked a long day and took work home at night , but I seldom do that now , " said the honorable Smith of Merrill Lynch , Pierce , Fenner &; Smith .
