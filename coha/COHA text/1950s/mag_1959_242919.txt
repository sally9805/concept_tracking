The trim Fokker Friendship turboprop that touched down at Washington 's National Airport last week was not as big as Nikita Khrushchev 's big TU-114 , but the welcome accorded its distinguished passenger was every bit as impressive-and considerably more cordial . As Mexico 's President Adolfo Lpez Mateos stepped out , a thundering 21-gun salute split the air ; the U.S. Army Band rolled through Mexico 's national anthem ; a 231-man honor guard snapped to attention . On the red carpet stood Dwight Eisenhower , all smiles . " Bienvenido , " said Ike , giving his guest a warm Latin-style embrace . <P> In response , the chief of a nation that the U.S. considers a fully equal Northern Hemisphere partner walked to a bank of microphones and put relations along the Rio Grande in a nutshell . Said Lpez Mateos : " No problem exists or can exist between our governments capable of weakening or jeopardizing this friendship . " <P> The statement took in much ground , but it was so . Compared to the days when Brigadier General John J. Pershing chased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . The Mexicans worry about the effect of cut-rate U.S. cotton surplus sales on its worldwide markets ; some U.S. mining outfits fret over Mexican taxes ; the sewers of Tijuana hamper ocean bathing near San Diego . And so it goes , trailing into insignificance . <P> Mexico 's President came mostly to repay friendly visits by Ike , brother Milton , and Texas Senator Lyndon B. Johnson , and the U.S. made sure that he would hit all the high spots . On the agenda : a White House state dinner , a day with Ike at Camp David in Maryland 's Catoctin Mountains , a helicopter's-eye look at Gettysburg , an Ike-guided visit to the Eisenhower farm , dinner with Ike at the White House correspondents ' dinner celebrating Eisenhower 's 69th birthday . From Washington , Lpez Mateos planned to go to Chicago , New York , the Canadian capital of Ottawa and then to Lyndon Johnson 's Texas ranch on his way home . <P> From beginning to end , the theme of the trip is the same as the name of his airplane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lpez Mateos ' government passed out to waiting U.S. newsmen : Amistad-Friendship.
