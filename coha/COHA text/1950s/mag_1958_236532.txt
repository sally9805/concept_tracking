In a shuffle of letters to Western chiefs of government and cocktail-party comments to Western diplomats , the Kremlin has been working hard to spread the notion that a parley at the summit is inevitable-on the Kremlin 's terms . Newsmen in Europe and Washington have helped the notion along by reporting surges of what was called " world opinion " in favor of a parley to " end " the cold war . When the U.S. , anxious not to repeat the letdown of 1955 's spirit of Geneva , insisted that points at issue be explored at the foreign minister or ambassadorial level before any summit meeting , the Kremlin set about making mileage with the appeasement-minded by charging that the U.S. " attitude on peace " was " negative . " <P> But one day last week the U.S.S.R. 's Bulganin , in his third letter to President Eisenhower in two months , went more than a step too far . In a too-obvious attempt to discredit Secretary of State Dulles , Bulganin suggested bypassing a meeting of foreign ministers in the preparations for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign ministers . Said Bulganin : " It is hardly necessary to explain why we would like to avoid this . " At once U.S. Congressmen and editorial writers began to rally around Dulles with a rare show of strength that fortified the whole U.S. position . <P> Down with Rapacki . From the floor of the Senate , Dulles got more praise than he has heard in months . New Hampshire 's Republican Styles Bridges , bitter critic of Dulles on foreign aid , called him " the most principled and resolved statesman of the West . " Montana Democrat Mike Mansfield , who needled Dulles unmercifully during last year 's great debate on the Eisenhower Doctrine , now reminded the Kremlin that Dulles is " the Secretary of State of the United States of America . " At his weekly press conference the President , questioned on Bulganin 's crack about biased foreign ministers , got a laugh when he cracked right back that the Kremlin " must have been talking about Foreign Minister Gromyko . " <P> The White House disposed of Bulganin 's latest letter with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , addressing itself to the much-discussed **31;15524;TOOLONG proposals of Poland 's Foreign Minister Adam Rapacki-since endorsed by the Kremlin as a suitable topic for the summit-warned all U.S. diplomatic missions overseas that such a plan is " extremely dangerous . " Added the President at his press conference , in a definitive statement of policy on such neutralize-Europe agreements : " <P> " Free nations , of which we are only one-and though we may be the strongest , we are simply another equal among equals - cannot make decisions respecting other free nations unilaterally or bilaterally with the Soviets . There has got to be an agreement in which the affected countries must be participants . . . We have established the NATO association realizing that the defense of the free world must work by cooperation when confronted by a monolith of force and power so great as the strength of the Communist area . . . We must not make a unilateral proposal that we go out , or that we demilitarize all Central Europe . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
