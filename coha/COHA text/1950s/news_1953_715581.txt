txt BID SENT KREMLIN Eisenhower Tells Aides to Make $15,000,000 Supplies Available Documents on food situation in East Germany , Page 5 . WASHINGTON , July 10 ? President Eisenhr'wer requested the Kremlin today to allow the United States to send $15,000,000 worth of food through the Iron Curtain to alleviate the hunger of Germans under Soviet control . The White House released early in the evening a note containing the food offer that was delivered in Moscow to Andrei Y. Vishinsky , Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister , by Elim O'Shaughnessy , United States Charg ? d'Affaires . The proposal to send the food grew out of a plea for aid that Dr. Konrad Adenauer , West German Chancellor , addressed to President Eisenhower July 4 . Dr. Adenauer said that the food supply of East Germany was endangered by Soviet policies and that the West German Government was planning to send food into the Soviet zone .

Soviet Placed in Dilemma While there were no indications that President Eisenhower 's offer to East Germany was released today as a propaganda move in connection with the purging of Lavrenti P. Beria from the Kremlin triumvirate yesterday , the development may well cause added embarrassment to an obviously harassed Soviet officialdom . There was no indication whether Russia would accept the offer , but obviously it posed a dilemma for the Kremlin . If the offer were accepted , it would entail a further loss of prestige for the Soviet Government in , the wake of the uprising of German workers June 17 and the continuing unrest in East Germany and in other satellite countries . If it were rejected , the subjugated people would be informed that a humanitarian program of I the United States had been cast aside , and this quite likely would increase the unrest . The President 's proposal was to be broadcast by the Voice of America , which has an outlet in BIAS ( Radio in the American Sector of Berlin ) which blankets the Soviet zone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food delivered , officials here expected the impact to compare i somewhat with the Berlin airlift as nn example of the strength and the humanity of the free world on the Western side of the Iron Curtain . President Eisenhower invited other free countries to join the effort to aid the people of East Germany " in this emergency . " Reply Sent to Adenauer General Eisenhower sent his reply to Chancellor Adenauer today , at the same time that Mr. O'Shaughnessy went to the Kremlin with the formal note . The note not only stated that the United States traditionally sought to alleviate suffering , starvation and disease wherever it might occur , but it also sought to lay a specific diplomatic basis for the action in these words : " Because of its position as an occupying power in Germany , my Government has a legitimate interest in the weltire of the people of Germany . " The note expressed the President 's " deep concern with the conditions existing in the Soviet zone of Germany and the increasing hardships to which the population of that area is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States are especially concerned over , the steadily deteriorating food supply for the population of that area which has been an important factor in resent demonstrations against the local authorities , " the note added . The offer was expressed thus : " Mindful of these needs , my Government has , therefore , decided to offer to the Soviet Union as the occupying power for distribution to the population of Eastern // Germany shipments of food amounting in value to approximately $15,000,000 and consisting of grain , sugar , lard , soybean oil and some other commodities . " The note stated that delivery and distribution could be worked out by the respective High Commissioners in Germany . In a statement announcing his action , President Eisenhower said he had directed John Foster Dulles , Secretary of State , and the Mutual Security Administrator to see that the food " is made available in Germany without delay . " In his reply to Chancellor Adenauer , President Eisenhower said that the serious situation in East Germany reported in his letter of July 4 had been confirmed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commissioner in Germany . The situation has been one " of considerable concern to me over the past few weeks , " he added . " It is true , " Chancellor Adenauer had written , " that the events of 17 June 1953 have prompted the rulers of the Soviet zone to announce , in this particular field certain relaxations , but according to information received by us , it is extremely doubtful whether the Communist rulers are actually willing , or able , to fulfill these promises . Therefore , the food sup ' ply of the Soviet zone must continue to be regarded as definitely endangered . " The Chancellor added that , unfortunately , West Germany could not relieve the political pressure of Germans under Soviet control , but it felt an obligation at least to act against hunger . Consequently , by resolution of the Bundestag , the West German Government is planning to use funds on a large scale for food to be sent into the Soviet zone through churches and charitable organizations , Dr. Adenauer said .
