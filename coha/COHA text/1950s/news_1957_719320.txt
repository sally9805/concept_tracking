txt The extent to which battles over integration in the South and the lure of high wage standards here have made New York a magnet for Negro migration was reflected in a population survey made public yesterday . It was released by the State Commission Against Discrimination . The survey showed that-the number of nonwhite persons in the five boroughs had gone up 320,221 since 1950 while the white total had gone down 416 , - 707 . On a percentage basis the change was even more startling . The nonwhite population rose 41.3 per cent , against a decline of 5.9 per cent for whites . In the suburbs both population groups recorded a sharp rise . On a percentage basis the increase for nonwhites generally ran well ahead of the increase for whites , but the numerical totals for whites exceeded those for Negroes by about 15 to 1 . Housing Problem Masked The statistics masked the problems of housing , education , employment and social adjustment caused by population shifts because the group that is coming to New York in the greatest numbers was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of Puerto Ricans are classified by the Census Bureau as nonwhites . On this basis 50,000 of the 600,000 Puerto Ricans in this city are tabulated as Negroes and the rest as whites . The ? number of Puerto Ricans here has doubled in the last seven years . On a state-wide basis the increase in the nonwhite population since 1950 was 44 per cent and the increase in the white population 5 per cent . This was not much different from the trend in the metropolitan area when the figures for the city were combined with the totals for the four suburban counties of Nassau , Suffolk , Westchester and Rockland . The rise in the nonwhite total for the entire New York segment of the metropolitan district was 42.5 per cent while the white population went up 5.2 per cent . However , the commission reported that one significant difference existed between the pattern here and elsewhere in the state . In New York Negroes , who make up 97 per cent of the nonwhite group , tended to settle much more heavily in outlying sections of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities . There the growth in Negro population was concentrated iri the center of cities , with almost none finding homes in suburban areas . Queens Growth Cited In Manhattan , always the focus of Negro migration in past years , the nonwhite total went up only 3.7 per cent . This contrasted with increases of 128.9 per cent in Queens , 121.1 per cent in the Bronx and 107.8 per cent in Suffolk County . However , the commission tempered its comment on the wider spread of Negro families in the metropolitan area by noting evidence that they tended to be bunched in certain limited areas . The New York area remains the home of the great bulk of the state 's Negroes . The survey showed 1,095,737 nonwhites in the city and 1,21.1,272 in the metropolitan district . This represented 88 per cgit of the state-wide total of 1,377,000 . The rate of growth in the last seven years has been about the same here and upstate . In 1950 the New York . area had 89 per cent of the nonwhite population . In 1940 it had 94 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than the population of Albany , the commission noted . In 1940 there were 36,000 nonwhites in the upstate area . For the whole state , nonwhites now make up 8.7 per cent ' of the population , as against 6.5 per cent in 1950 . In this city the nonwhite group constitutes 14.2 per cent of the total , as against 9.8 per cent seven years ago . Housing Held Needed In making public the report , Charles Abrams , chairman of the commission , said that the dramatic changes in the racial composition of the state 's communities added new pressure to the need for improved housing for minority groups . " Although there has been a 44 per cent increase in nonwhite population in the past seven years , virtually no new private construction in the state - has been opened to nonwhites , " Commissioner Abrams declared . " Our figures , particularly in the upstate area , show that in most every case the nonwhite population increase has occurred in the central cities . This means that the many newcomers to our state have been forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cities . " He reported that many oi ' the Negroes coming into the state were young men and women from the South seeking better job opportunities and freedom from race bias . He added that a higher birth rate among nonwhite families also was a factor in the population rise . " For some years to come , " Mr. Abrams declared , " we can expect that the nonwhite population will continue to grow rapidly , both through a continuing high birth rate and continuing in-migration . " The survey was based in most instances on Census Bureau figures , supplemented by birth reports from the State Health Department . Most of the tabulating was done by George and Eunice Grier of the commission 's research division . Nonwhites Triple Here Their statistics indicated that the nonwhite population of the five boroughs had tripled since 1930 while the white total stood almost still . The nonwhite figure for 1930 was 341,069 , compared with a current figure of 1,095,737 , The white total inched up from 6,589,377 to 6,699,734 . The degree to which the suburban rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject of a special analysis of the figures for Westchester County . The number of nonwhites in the county rose 33 per cent in the last seven years , but threefifths of the increase was concentrated in Mount Vernon , New Rochelle and White Plains . The commission noted that each of these would be regarded as a city of some size if its proximity to New York did not put it into the suburban class . Meanwhile , in a Rochester speech yesterday Governor Harriman called discrimination in employment " the key factor in keeping many families in a lowincome bracket . " He based his statement on preliminary findings of another study in process of completion by the commission . The Governor told the State Welfare Conference that it was " a tragic paradox " in the midst ' of general prosperity that thousands of families continued to have incomes below the minimum standard set for- public relief . He called for action by public and private agencies to eliminate bias .                 @ @ @ @
