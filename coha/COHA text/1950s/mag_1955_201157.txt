" I am grateful for the opportunity this country has given me to make a place in the world for myself , " said Danish-born Peter Strobel in June 1954 to Washington newsmen . " By taking this job perhaps I can partly pay back this country . " With that , Strobel left Strobel &; Salzman , a Manhattan engineering partnership that paid him about $100,000 annually , for the $14,800-a-year job of Public Buildings Commissioner in the General Services Administration . As such , Strobel had charge of letting millions of dollars of contracts . <P> <P> Last week the Government career of Peter Strobel seemed to be drawing to an end after three days of hearings before Representative Emanuel Celler 's House Judiciary subcommittee , which is probing possible conflict of interest of businessmen in Government . <P> <P> With the knowledge of GSAdministrator Edmund Mansure , said Strobel , he kept his controlling interest in his firm after going to Washington , but in no way " used or sought to use my official position to further the firm 's interests . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract for remodeling a Government building to be awarded to a Manhattan architectural firm which was also one of his company 's clients , even though the usual practice is to award such contracts after competitive bidding . Another time , said the committee , Strobel personally went to Ferrenz &; Taylor , a Manhattan architectural firm which had hitherto done no business with his firm or with the Government , and solicited an $18,000 construction contract for his engineering company . Strobel also testified that after joining GSA he went around to the Army Engineer Corps and pressed a claim for $7,500 still owed his company by the Government . Said Strobel : " But I did it on my lunch hour . " <P> After Strobel was through testifying , GSA Chief Mansure told newsmen that he would let Strobel resign . Said Mansure : " Strobel has done nothing really wrong , but he just did n't use good judgment . " He added that Strobel had not only put off signing the GSA 's standard no conflict-of-interest pledge for half a year , but that it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clients out of him . <P> Snapped Strobel , who has been fighting with Mansure over GSA procedures : " I did n't want anybody snooping around my private business . Besides , I had other things to do . I was working 12 hours a day . If they want to get rid of me , they 'll have to fire me . I 'm not the kind of man who runs . "
