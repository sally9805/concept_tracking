txt The force of circumstance , coupled with shrewd prilitica ! planning , has placed Richard M. Nixon in a peculiarly powerful position to bid for the White House in 1960 ? even before his inauguration for a second term in the Vice Presidency . This fact is one of the considerations behind Senator Knowland 's decision to retire from the Senate next year . Mr. Knowland knows that he ca n't challenge the Vice President 's firm grip on the Republican party from the Senate floor ; if he is to have any hope for stopping Nixon at all he must move early and from a stronger vantage point ? say . the governorship of California , which he is expected to seek in 1988 . Mr. Nixon 's strategic political situation also helps explain some other things . Always an influence In the Administration and Congress , the Vice President is now a real power . Previously he played the role of " fixer " for the President ; now he is shaping policy more than in the past . The simple reason : His new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more confidence . What are the things that lead some G. 0 . P. politicians  --  and Mr. Nixon himself ? to the conclusion that his nomination four Years hence is all but inevitable ? In the first place , if President Eisenhower does not serve out his second term . Mr. Nixon would automatically succeed to the Presidency . Once in the job , he would be in a position to consolidate his hold on the party , and his nomination in 1960 might never be seriously challenged . This is a possibility , however remote , that realistic Republican leaders must reckon with . Commanding Position In the second place , assuming Mr. Eisenhower serves through 1960 , Mr. Nixon is in a commanding position because he has outflanked most of his opponents within the party . Before the November election , for example , his opponents were privately promoting the theory  --  and Harold Stassen stated it publicly  --  that the Nixon name on the Eisenhower ticket would immeasurably lessen G. 0 . P. chances of holding the White House . But when the votes were counted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his party 's appeal . This was not merely a victory.by.accident for Mr Nixon . He helped achieve it by demonstrating during the campaign his vigor and effectiveness as a campaigner . The Vice President himself has gone a long way toward dispelling the notion that he is not a winner . Another argument of his opponents has been that Mr. Nixon " does n't stand for anything , " although this was hardly borne out by his record first in the House and then in the Senate . True or not , Mr. Nixon is moving swiftly to correct that impression . His gambit has been to identity himself more and more with Administration poll.cies , not merely as a follower but as an originator of those policies . It was he who first called for an expanded foreign aid program , now Administration policy . It was he who first proposed a more liberal plan for Hungarian refugees , which is now also Administration policy . Mr. Nixon has gone further . He took . pains to sid1 with the " liberals " during the recent dispute over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civil rights legislation . Here he was not expressing Administration policy or even the policy of many Republicans  --  Senator Knowland , for one , disagreed with him . But the Vice President was showing that he did " stand for something . " Finally , Mr. Nixon has One incomparable advantage . His party is short of other Presidential timber . Few and Far Between Four years , of course , is a long time in politics and before 1960 new rivals may arise . But right now it is hard to find many serious White House challengers in the ranks of the G.O.P. Most of the big state houses are occupied by Democrats . Harriman reigns in New York , Meyner in New Jersey , G. Mennen Williams in Michigan , Leader in Pennsylvania , Furculo in Massachusetts . Illinois does have a Republican governor , but Mr. Stratton 's halo has been tarnished by scandals in his administration . California also has a Republican , but about the only thing most political observers can say about " Goody " Knight is that he 's willin ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something about . If he can win the California governorship , he will be in a position to control the second largest bloc of delegates to the 1960 convention . He will also have demonstrated hip ability to get elected to an executive office fn a very populous state and he will have a chance to show what he can do as an executive . All this would make Knowland a potential rival for Nixon . It is an historical fact that both political parties turn more often to stare houses than to Congress for their Presidential candidate ; in this century only Harding.has moved directly from Senate floor to White House . Fatherly Blessing But even if Senator Kr " iowland succeeds in California , tie will still not have overcome Nixon 's lead . Mr. Nixon has a wide hold on the party organization in the states and precincts . He has the backing of the old Taft wing of the party . He has the confidence of the Eisenhower Republicans and the fatherly blessing ? if not the public endorsement ? of Mr. Eisenhower himself . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own political skill . He has taken a job that could have led ' to oblivion . Instead he has made it a position of power  --  and very likely a springboard to the White House .
