In the afterglow of the success of last year 's Perry Como and Dinah Shore shows , the TV networks are taking a high shine to popular singers in jumbo productions . In fact , the TV season threatens to be , in the phrase of one critic , a case of " the bland leading the bland . " TV 's Pepsi-Cola girl , Polly Bergen , got mired down in embarrassingly labored exchanges with a shrill , scenery-chewing " panel " of other show folk , and only when she used her high but lilty voice did her seductive talents poke through . The Hit Parade was back ( in stunning color for the 200,000 color-set owners ) , with a bevy of new performers led by young , moist-eyed Jill Corey , whose vocal renderings come with a lush , built-in sob . On the densely populated show called The Big Record , moonfaced Patti Page was mostly what the late Fred Allen called a Pointer , i.e. , someone who points at someone else doing an act and says " Watch him " - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do by smearing meat on the actors . " But when Patti lent her big , plain voice to the color-drenched proceedings , she was as pretty and wholesome as a milkmaid . The new George Gobel-Eddie Fisher songfest was not exactly the " wonderful show " Eddie called it , but shy , impish Lonesome George again proved himself the master of the minor key-even when delivering a monologue plugging NBC color . Of all the new musicals , the best was the simplest : The Lux Show ( replacing the old Lux Theater ) , with blonde , willowy Rosemary Clooney . Whether delivering barrelhouse or blues , Songstress Clooney 's voice has a distinctive cello quality that makes her refreshingly different from the sound-alike mass . <P> <P> CBS 's Playhouse 90 , TV 's only 1-hour show , was last year 's best dramatic program . So far this year it is only the longest . Last week the show tried an adaptation of Topaze , Marcel Pagnol 's tart comedy about a naively idealistic French teacher who is gulled by a grafting politician until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own reward . The preposterous little fable is funniest when played in deadly earnest . Playhouse 90 pitched it in a mood of self-conscious farce with blackouts to end each act , played it with an ill-starred cast . Comedian Ernie Kovacs as Topaze and Carl Reiner as the swindler heightened the effect of a rambling revue skit , did not so much dominate as swamp their roles with their familiar TV personalities . Still , in a medium that mines so much of its comedy from mothers and fathers who know best , even this production of Topaze had the rare virtue of a refreshingly cynical point of view . <P> <P> As the second edition of its 26-part Wisdom series , NBC presented a perceptive glimpse of Israel 's Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion , 70 , in his Tel Aviv library . Notable quote from the man who built a new country : " I 'm living in a house and I know I built it . I work in a workshop which was constructed by me . I speak a language which I developed . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own ability . I feel I am safe . I can defend myself . I am not afraid . This is the greatest happiness a man can feel-that he could be a partner with the Lord in creation . This is the real happiness of man-creative life , conquest of nature , and a great purpose .
