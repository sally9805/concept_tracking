South Africa 's literature is remarkable for the fact that its women writers are better than the men . The best South African biography is Sarah Gertrude Millin 's Cecil Rhodes ; the best novels , Olive Schreiner 's The Story of an African Farm ( 1883 ) and Pauline Smith 's The Beadle ( 1926 ) . Publication of The Fire-Raisers brings another woman novelist into the front rank of South African fiction . <P> Jean Heather Marris Murray , daughter of a Scottish emigrant father and a South African mother , was born in Pretoria . An Oxford scholarship took her to England , where she worked as a free-lance journalist throughout World War II . The Fire-Raisers is her first novel but is written with a skill and confidence that make it close to the most impressive story yet about the South Africa of Malanism and apartheid . <P> To Author Murray , Malanism is not a problem of politics or Anglo-Dutch disharmony ; it is just one of the symptoms of a chronic disease which she calls " the African sickness " -a complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa that those who suffer from it are usually the last to know it . <P> The Enclosing Mountains . Author Murray 's scene is a South African valley , bounded by mountains and the sea , and speckled with the houses and shacks of Dutch , English , French and Kaffir Africans . On the surface , it is like any other valley in the civilized world- " a poor community , " says old Jacob Fieldfare , " where someone is always frowning over a bill , or scraping to buy a new coat . We tell lies and gossip , our faces are drawn with longing for possessions and qualities which we do not have : power , personality , happiness , electric light , golf championships , more brandy , exciting friends , fame , white skins , a second chance , youth , a penny off the milk or a penny on the milk ... " <P> But the people of the valley are suffering from one form or another of African sickness .

His foster father Jacob , with whom Etienne lives , has spent his time observing life with such quiet detachment that he has " reached his sixtieth year without ever having had a serious illness or an enduring sorrow . " Vigorous pioneers built the home of Jacob and Etienne , but in four generations the family has " shrunk to two quiet bachelors . " <P> Elsewhere in the valley the sickness takes stranger forms , intensified by the fact that the people of European stock have " become aware of the narrowness and danger of their circumstances : the threatening sea , the enclosing mountains , and behind them the sullen weight of an awaking continent . " Storekeeper Fluit , for example , is " gravely ill " with the conviction that " man , nature and evil powers " are all plotting against him , and that to survive he must be " sullen , suspicious and constantly on guard .
