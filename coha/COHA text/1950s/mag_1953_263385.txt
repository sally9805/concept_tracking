The world 's biggest sugar operator is a little known Havana trader named Julio Lobo . A short , imperious man of 54 , Lobo has more to do than anybody else with determining the world price of sugar . He handles about half the entire Cuban crop , at least a fourth of the Puerto Rican and Philippine crops , owns or controls up to 30 Cuban sugar mills , and dominates the market everywhere . " I am the market , " he says . " I buy and sell sugar any time , day or night . " Last week , as Cuba 's 5,000,000-ton sugar harvest rolled toward the market , Lobo operated right around the clock , closing deals with New York , London , Frankfurt , Paris , Rio and Manila , involving millions of dollars . <P> Lobo 's mastery over the marketing of Cuba 's No. 1 product has won him a fortune estimated at $70 million . " I back my judgment , " Lobo says , " with good , fast , accurate information , courage and cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. refiners find it unprofitable to buy at any time and in any quantity and thus compete with Lobo ; in practice , they have to come to him for their Cuban sugar , and sometimes pay through the nose . <P> Born in Caracas , whence his banker-father fled to Havana after a turn-of-the-century revolution , Lobo was schooled in sugar-mill engineering at Louisiana State University . He learned sugar marketing in the hard times following World War I , when he was called home to put his father 's factoring firm of Lobo y Cia back on its feet and soon earned a reputation as a top trader . <P> After his father 's death in 1950 , Lobo moved his 10,000 volumes on Napoleon , his collection of Goyas and Gainsboroughs and his two daughters into the old man 's palace in staid Vedado . A fond , though divorced , father , he used to paste thought-provoking newspaper articles on his daughters ' boudoir mirrors , made them eat ground-up egg shells to add calcium for brain food , and urged them to sit under a mango @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his best inspiration in its shade . <P> So that he can spend more time with " my mistress , sugar , " he has fitted out a penthouse over his office . Even when he travels , as he often does , to Europe , the U.S. and South America , Lobo deals in sugar day &; night by international telephone . " This business needs me , " he says . His name in Spanish means " wolf " - " lone wolf , " he explains with relish . Evenings , he says , when the last of the day 's 500 cables have been answered , " I like to walk alone from my office to the harbor . There I can sit on the edge of a pier , gaze at the lapping waves , and think about the future of sugar . "
