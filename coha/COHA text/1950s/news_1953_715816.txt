Most of the passengers escaped despite a fire that burned so furiously through the plane 's 4,500 gallons of gasoline that its fuselage was destroyed and its wings still were burning at 3:30 A. M. Assistant District Attorney Thomas Cullen began an investigation on the scene . He charged that airline officials were unwilling to permit crew members to be questioned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Precinct Station in Queens . The pilot , Cecil C. Foxworth of Summit , N.

Devrids and Flight Attendants Al Foley and Ann Krause were unhurt . " We suddenly found ourselves on the ground , and I saw flames coming from the right engine , " the pilot said . The Constellation , whose takeoff had been delayed because of the fog blanketing the world 's busiest airport , had sped 8,000 feet down the runway at the southeastern end of the field and had climbed about 100 feet when the police and airport officials said , its left wing dipped and flew off the plane .

" The heat was terrific , but the steward just leaped through . the flames . If it were n't for him , nobody would have had the nerve to jump from the plane . " The screaming passengers rushed to escape , jumping from the door opened by the steward , Mr. Gore said . First reports on who opened the door conflicted , but all agreed that , the man who led the way was the hero of the disaster . One of the first on the scene , Nicholas Niedziedski , 28 years old , a fuel attendant at the airport , said he rushed to the wreckage ? with foam fire-fighting equipment and found two men and a woman lying on the ground . The plane was 300 feet off the airstrip in a marsh . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right side of the plane and spread to the gas tank in the right wing . The first man who opened the plane door was driven back by a seething sheet of fire , Mr. Niedziedski said , but a moment later ' he leaped through the flames . His ' action apparently gave fellow passengers courage . Despite the threat of death , they presumably realized it was the only way out , and they jumped . Some ran hysterically almost two miles to the administration building . Mr. Gore said that the ground to which the frantic passengers leaped also was " a mass of flames , " apparently from gasoline spilled in the crash . " It seemed to me most everybody got out . We all chipped in and helped each other . " In tribute to the man who opened the door and led the way to escape , Mr. Gore said : " If it were n't for him , nobody would have had the nerve to jump .
