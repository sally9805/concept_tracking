In her best bird-brained manner , Gracie floundered in malapropisms , clipped the top off a boxwood hedge with George 's electric razor , soundly bussed a startled book salesman ( so " snoopers " would n't catch her talking to a strange man ) . Using the reliable formula that won them more than 45 million radio listeners , George Burns and Gracie Allen were making their bow on TV with the first in a bimonthly series ( Thurs. 8 p.m. , CBS-TV ) . <P> Old Vaudevillians Burns &; Allen are not likely to disappoint their fans . Pointing up Gracie 's gags , Straightman George uses a slow-burn delivery and purse-mouthed pauses ( " A man drowned once while I was pausing " ) . Compared to the machine-gun patter of most TV comics , his style gives the show a relaxed , almost leisurely pace . A high point of the program : Gracie 's dubious plugs for Carnation Milk ( " I do n't see how they get milk from carnations " ) . <P> What do Burns &; Allen think about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never at a loss for a gag : " Now everybody can see and hear what I 've been seeing and hearing for 25 years . "
