Most physicians are convinced that alcoholism is , at bottom , a psychological disorder . Roger John Williams , famed biochemist of the University of Texas , had a different theory . The trouble , he argued might have a physical basis . Now , in Nutrition and Alcoholism ( University ol Oklahoma ; $2 ) , Williams suggests that vitamins have achieved history 's first honest-to-goodness cure in a case of alcoholism , making the patient truly able to take a drink or leave it . <P> Williams believes that while all men need the same vitamins and minerals , they do not need them in the same amounts or the same proportions . Many human disorders , he thinks , arise because some people ( partly because of heredity ) need some life-essential substances in far greater quantities than normal diets supply . <P> Drunken Rats . Dr. Williams ' theory is that the craving for alcohol is one such disorder . ( He does not explain why a need for vitamins should produce a craving for alcohol which contains no vitamins , and actually increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on rats , turning them into drunkards by deficient diets and curing them with walloping doses of vitamins . <P> Then along came a heavy drinker for whom psychiatry and group therapy had done no good . No physician , Biochemist Williams suggested that he be treated with massive doses of 15 vitamins-A , C , D and E , and eleven of the B complex . The patient shunned alcohol for a while . Williams and his colleagues thought that the patient should remain a total abstainer . The patient went them one better . He showed that he could drink two or three bottles of beer , then quit . <P> " This individual , " says Williams , " probably constitutes the first case on record in which an alcoholic has become a moderate drinker . " There were others among the few alcoholics treated with vitamins by the time Williams wrote his book . Since then , doctors at Boston 's Peter Bent Brigham Hospital have tested the method with 85 alcoholics , giving some of them dummy capsules to rule out the psychological factor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> No " Average Man . " No man was better equipped than Roger Williams to show what vitamins could do . The younger ( 58 ) brother of Robert Runnels Williams of B1 and beriberi fame ( TIME , April 30 ) , he identified pantothenic acid and helped to discover folic acid , two of the vitamins in the B complex , did pioneering work on several of the others . Along the way , Roger Williams became distressed by the way science tends to deal with the nonexistent " average man , " plumped for a science of " humanics " in which differences among men , rather than similarities , would be emphasized . <P> In his quiet way , Williams is determined to extend the biochemical humanics approach to other fields . He even thinks it might be applied to the problem of marriage and divorce .
