txt President Truman 's delay in nominating judges to fill three vacancies on the federal bench in Chicago was bitterly assailed yesterday by Chief Judge J. Earl Major of the United States Court of Appeals . He asserted that reports on Major the delay " simmer down to the sordid proposition that somebody is more interested in politics than the courts . " Others Indorse Stand Judge Major 's denunciation was indorsed by Sherman Minton , associate justice of the United States Supreme court who formerly sat on the appeals bench here . Henry P. Chandler , director of the administrative office of the United States courts , also decried the man power shortage in the District court and said he hoped it would be remedied soon . The speakers addressed a joint meeting of the Bar Association of the United States Court of Appeals and the annual Judicial Conference of the Seventh Circuit of the Court of Appeals .

And it might help , it certainly could not make the situation any worse , if every lawyer in Chicago sent the President a telegram every morning before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existing vacancies are filled . " This long and unexplained delay is inexcusable and indefensible . " Many Could Fill Jobs ? Major declared that at least 100 lawyers in Chicago would be a credit to the district bench . " Of course , " he remarked , " some of them might be Republicans , and it is too much to hope that lawyers of that kind of a reputation should be appointed . One of the crude fallacies which seems to have long prevailed in this country is that a federal judge when appointed must have the same politics as the administration .
