txt Two months ago some twenty : Americans , encamped on an ice floe drifting through winter darkness near the North Pole ; were startled by an unbelieVi able sound , like that of an proaching express train . It ran right through their camp . They hurried out of their. - clustered buildings with flashy lights and hunted until the. - found a hair-like crack in the , , ice . It was evident that their home was doomed . A few weeks later , on Dec. 21 , thirty Russians similarly , camped nearer the pole , found their community split in These two groups of men had , . placed themselves in jeopardy to carry out some of the more , dramatic research of the Inter-. ; national Geophysical Year. -1 That eighteen-month Study this planet ended Wednesday ; One of its fields of researchl was glaciology and other phaf nomena in the polar regions . It is with this part of the effort , that this article deals . ' 7 ' Some- of the scientists e1 , k gaged in this program were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 7 , ' at the South Pole itself . They also were high mountain glaciers iri Alaska and Siberia , having been carried there , with their huts and supplies , by ski planes , by helicopters , by hordes of reindeer or by horses . A dozen of the ' animals had been lost in mountain torrents or down glacier crevasses . ? It was hoped that the combined efforts of these far-flung men would help solve the riddle of the ice ages . What causes them ? Is a new one upon us ? Will the Arctic Ocean soon be free of ice ? - ? Of the 4,000 stations and obse , vatories of the I : G. Y. , all but four were fairly stationary , although some on glacier ice crept a few feet each day . The four exceptions were the drifting stations on . the Arctic Ocean . Driven hither and yon by the whims of wind and current , they traveled as much as 4,000 miles . Two of the stations were American and two were Soviet . Repeatedly cracks threatened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strips , which were their only link to the outside world . ? The perils they faced were often unexpected . Polar bears prowled the camps , even those hardly more than 100 miles from the North Pole . The chief problem was not the cold , but summer melting . This sometimes flooded entire camps and Made it impossible for aircraft to land for months . at a time . The scientists studied not only the weather above , but also the bottom of the ice beneath their feet , donning aqualungs to swim under the floes . Here are reports on some of ' these projects : STATION A ( UNITED STATES ) This was established in the spring of 1957 on an ice floe about seven feet thick and two miles square . It was them 925 miles north of Alaska and 375 miles from the North Pole . The Alaskan Air Command parachuted heavy equipment for smoothing a runway on the ice so that large planes could bring in the- supplies . All went well until last April , when part of the floe broke off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flew out all but a skeleton crew of ten , leaving just enough men to keep the obser vations going . On May 2 it was decided to shift the camp to an adjacent floe a mile away . The rest of the crew were flown in again , all twenty-one buildings were jacked up and placed on runners , Passes were cut through the pressure ridges . Power cable was dug out of the ice and everything dinged to the new site . Few Observations Missed Only two observations with radio weather balloons ( rawinsondes ) were missed . There was no interruption in the seismic , gravity , oceanographic and magnetic programs . By May 24 the move was completed and a new runway built , but hardly more than two weeks later the floe broke open across the runway in two places . Likewise , the melting of summer snow had made the floe surface into a lake . Holes were bored through the ice to drain the water , Twelve days later on June 22 , a new runway had been laid out , but it cracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weather cooled , was it possible to land an aircraft on the floe . On Nov. 2 , in the midst of the winter night , the floe , buffeted by a severe storm , split again , dividing the camp from its airfield . This time a rescue plane lifted out the entire crew and the camp was abandoned . The tinder-ice swimming was done by T. Saunders English of the University of Alaska and two other men , wearing waterproof clothing and breathing apparatus . They measured the amount of light coming through the ice to support the plant life encrusted on the bottoms of the floes . Likewise , they , studied the small animals that graze on these plants . During their long drift they trawled the water at various depthss and scraped brittle stars and sea cucumbers from the deep ocean floor . Norbert Untersteiner , an Austrian at the University of Washington , did ice studies . It was found that during the summer all of the snow cover and 11 per cent of the old ice melted . This formed ponds , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the growth of the ice on the bottom the previous winter , that was determined , by cores drilled from the ice , to be a layer about two feet thick . One of the stranger phenomena was the growth of ice from the bottom up in pools of fresh water under the floe . This water , drained from the floe , first froze nearest the underlying salt water . Hence the pools were sandwiched between the floe above and this layer of new ice below . Station A moved as much as 150 miles in a month , from June 17 to July 17 . Echoes from explosions set off once or twice a day brought to light a five-toten-thousand-foot ridge rising from the ocean floor and extending from off Ellesmere Island toward eastern Siberia . STATION B ( UNITED STATES ) This was placed on a heavy platter of ice , known as T-3 or Fletcher 's Ice Island , north of Ellesmere Island . It is far more substantial than an ice floe , being about 150 feet thick , nine miles long and four and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is thought to have once been part of the apron of floating ice attached to Ellesmere Island . Much of the work was similar to that at Station A. Air operations were impossible during summer months when the runway was flooded . Up to three feet melted off the top of the ice island . The water formed little rivers , which mystifyingly changed the - direction of their flow from Wile to time . This , it was pund , was caused by changes in tilt of the island in strong winds . Skirts had been placed around the buildings to prevent melting of their ice foundations , but these were inadequate . Cargo parachutes were used to help keep off the sunlight , but even so , at the end of summer each building stood precariously on a pedestal of ice . As had been predicted , the temperature extremes near the North Pole were far milder than deep in Siberia or Antarctica . The highest reading at Station A was 38 degrees Fahrenheit and the lowest 57 below zero . Station because of its size , acted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 65 below . In Siberia the mercury falls to 90 below zero and in Antarctica to 125 below . The , stratosphere over the drifting stations , nevertheless , became very cold . Temperatures as low as 121 below were recorded there by weather balloons . NORTH POLE 6 ( SOVIET ) This camp , on an ice island , was established about April , 1956 . Up to last October it had drifted a straight line distance of 1,050 miles . In its meanderings it had covered 4,064 miles . Its scientific program included three all-sky photographs of the aurora each minute , four radiosonde launchings a day to elevations between fourteen and ' sixteen miles , oceanic soundings several times a day and use of a searchlight at night to observe the height of the cloud ceiling . The island was thinner than that of Station B. It was from twenty-one to forty-one feet thick , thinning toward the edges until it was no thicker than the surrounding floes . As at Station B , isolated rocks on the ice showed it had originated near land . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom , rather than from piled-up snow . NORTH POLE 7 ( SOVIET ) This ice floe camp was established in April , 1957 . By last October it had moved a - straightline distance . of more Ilan 600 miles and a wandering course of almost 2,000 miles . As at the other stations , summer thaws made islands of the huts and holes had to be drilled . The resulting drainage of several thousand tons of water caused the floe to rise . When it was only 112 miles from the Pole , a contingent of polar bears paid a visit and remained " some time , " according to a Soviet account . ' At Station A a cub knocked out all the runway lights . This last fall North Pole 7 moved an average of seven miles a day for a month . By December it had crumbled from an area of 4,200 square yards to a mere 900 square yards then , on Dec. 21 , it split . In addition to maintaining these stations , the Russians used planes to place automatic weather stations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arctic Ocean to keep track of weather and ice movements . They also planned , during a period of several days , to do an aerial survey of pack ice distribution in the entire ocean area north of the coasts of Europe and Asia . Soviet plans call for an increased tempo of Arctic exploration in the next seven years , with twenty expeditions scheduled to take the field each year . At the opposite end of the ' world eight nations joined forces to probe the secrets of Antarctica . It was the greatest assault ever launched on that continent and was widely publicized . Last winter , during wfat was summer in the Antarctic , parties With tractors or dog teams covered at least 14,000 miles of the ice sheet . The operations will also be extensive during the current southern summer . Preliminary reports on the results have been received from scientists in the Hfield and from Philip Benjamin , New York Times correspondent with the United States expedition . Mr. Benjamin cites increasing evidence that Antarctica is cut in two by a trough between the Ross and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has long been postulated , but during the I. G. Y. such a feature was detected near the coast of the Weddell Sea . Its bottom averaged 3,500 feet below sea level . At the opposite end of the supposed trough the ocean floor dipped beneath the floating Ross Ice Shelf to a point forty-eight miles south of Mount Discovery , where it was 4,400 feet below sea level . In the heart of Marie Byrd Land , midway between the two seas , it was found that the terrain dropped lower between Byrd Station and the mountains to the south . The ice depths recorded by the many Antarctic trail parties indicated that there was about 40 per cent more ice in the world than had been supposed . It was enough to cover the entire earth to a depth of 100 feet . There was some evidence of ice shrinkage . More than 1,000 square miles of Lady Newnes IIce Shelf had vanished since 1912. t P. Shumsky , head of ice studies of the Soviet expedition , reported that the surface of the ice sheet surrounding Mount Gauss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty-five years since the Germans surveyed it . The peak lies close to the main Soviet base at Mirny . On the other hand a survey of glaciers in the largely icefree valleys near Sound , carried out by Dr. Troy Fdwe of the University of Alaska , indicated no change in " the last forty-five years . It was found that snowfall in Antarctica was surprisingly meager and melting almost non-existent . Hence any changes in the ice volume would be very gradual . There was evidence that the climate in Antarctica had warmed , but not at the Dace observable in the Atlantic sector of the Arctic . The average temperature at Little America was up five degrees since 1911 . Numerous expeditions were stationed on glaciers between the polar regions . They ranged from Mount Olympus in the State of Washington to the Brooks Range of Alaska , the Sunta.r-Khayata , Mountains of Siberia , the Pamirs north of Afghanistan and even remote Franz Joseph Land in the Arctic Ocean . In the last-named place two girls of a Soviet party worked in a laboratory carved out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended , the basic questions about the ice ages still had not been answered . It had not been expected that they would be . Yet it seemed possible that the necessary information was in hand . It would have to be digested by business machines and studied by scientists in many fields . Meanwhile , more clues are being sought . Consequently , sooner or later it seems likely that the world will know whether future generations will have to migrate southward , in flight from advancing ice , or inland to flee rising oceans , swollen by the melting of present ice sheets .
