Though he wore a handkerchief mask over the lower part of his face , the tall man in mirror-type sunglasses seemed to show a workmanly patience at his job . For more than an hour one dark morning last week , he painstakingly measured out puddles of gasoline in each of the five dining rooms of Allgauer 's Fireside restaurant in Lincolnwood , a suburb northwest of Chicago . While a stubby accomplice leveled an automatic at seven late workers and busboys , he methodically laid fuses of gasoline-soaked toilet paper from pool to pool . When , at 3:45 a.m .. things were finally ready , the two hoods herded their captives out the back door unharmed , threw a flaming packet of matches inside , closed the door and drove off into the night while one of Cook County 's biggest and best restaurants exploded into a million-dollar fire . <P> Business as Usual . Chicagoans read the blaze as a message written brazenly across the sky by the smooth-running , omnipresent crime syndicate . The Fireside 's proprietor , Gustav Allgauer , 54 , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the few restaurant men in the city who had talked at length with investigators from Arkansas ' John McClellan 's Senate labor-management investigating committee . Subject of conversations : mob-dominated locals - called in local argot " The Miscellaneous " - of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. restaurant workers ' union . Not only did Gus Allgauer have a six-year record of dealings with the Miscellaneous , but he had a bookful of canceled checks to prove it . <P> The Illinois state 's attorney 's office , the Cook County sheriff and even the Chicago police took up the search for the arsonists , but Chicago newspapers , well aware that Chicago police have yet to solve a single one of a string of restaurant bombings and burnings stretching back to 1950. were skeptical . " If investigators ... do no more than to go through the motions of making an inquiry . " editorialized the Sun-Times , " other racketeers will only be emboldened to resort to similar methods in an effort to silence prospective witnesses in court cases as well as in congressional hearings . " Added the Tribune : " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy evidence and punish and intimidate witnesses before a Senate investigating committee ought to dismay every citizen and especially every union man . " <P> Who Is Sovereign ? At first . Restaurateur Gustav Allgauer was breathing fire and brimstone and all manner of indignation , promising to " tell everything I know . ' ' Then , suddenly , he switched signals and wanted to know what all the fuss was about - meanwhile prudently surveying the $1.000,000 worth of damage with his insurance broker . <P> In Washington Senator McClellan had the last word , just as his labor-management investigating committee hoped ultimately to have the last word when hearings begin next month . And what stern John McClellan had to say added up to a different kind of blaze across the sky . Open defiance of legal federal inquiry ' ' really challenges the sovereignty of government . ' ' said he . " Though we have n't even scratched the surfaces yet , the incidents of violence and attempted intimidation underscore the need for laws to drive the crooks out of the labor movement .
