If they are lucky , the stooping figures busily combing a Florida beach ( above ) will rub away the sand from a hard calcium object and find underneath a shell which , like the beauties pictured opposite , will compare favorably with the fanciest jewels yet devised by man or nature . Almost any child or adult who has ever roamed a beach has probably enjoyed the thrill of discovering one such shell , but to the systematic collector it is an experience that has become almost commonplace . For collectors , a cheerful and obsessed band of hobbyists who sometimes go to amazing lengths to get hold of a particular shell , operate in an enormous and still largely unexplored world , in which the very names attest poetically to the infinite variety of its color and form : lion's-paw , angel wing , Venus's-comb , bleeding tooth , jewel box , baby's-cradle , silver lantern , Scotch bonnet , precious tusk and sad unicorn . // Shells are the liquid cement secretion of animals called mollusks which wear their skeletons on the outside . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being found every year , and there may be another 50,000 awaiting discovery . Mollusks can be found in the ocean , on mountains , near the poles , on the desert , on the tops of trees and under their roots , in the jungle , in fresh-water ponds and even in hot springs . They climb , crawl , burrow , swim , dive , float , spin a web , and some fly . Certain species are bisexual . Others change sex with confusing frequency ; and one , the California sea hare , is so prolific it is said to spawn around 100 million eggs a month . Some eat voraciously , others hibernate for years without nourishment . A few are venomous and can kill a man . Many are microscopic , but the giant clam of the Pacific 's coral reefs often reaches a thumping 500 pounds . // Regardless of their size , however , most mollusks maintain an absolute mathematical control over their own growth , so that their perfect symmetry is never marred . ( Each new coil of the celebrated chambered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the width of the coil preceding it . ) The patterns and colors ornamenting the shells are produced by a series of pigment glands on the edge of a flap of skin called the mantle . Unfortunately , of the untold billions of shells washed up on the world 's shores each year , only one percent are worth saving , the abrasive action of wind , sand and sea having dimmed their color and softened their form . // Probably the most sought-after shell in the world is the gold-and-porcelain glory-of-the-sea cone ( page 34 ) , three of which were first sighted in the Philippines in 1838 . Only 23 can be located today , making them extremely valuable , but the bottom could fall out of the market in a flash if a collector should stumble on a large colony , as happened a few years ago with the golden-mouthed Busy con . Only two were known to exist . Then one day some Florida shrimp men came in with 100 specimens . Dealers immediately downpriced the shell to $5 for their good customers , and then learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrimpers have never dredged up another golden-mouth. // Shells are at their best and most prolific in warm waters . In the U.S. and environs the outstanding spots are the lazy beaches of Magdalena Bay on the southwest coast of Baja California and the palm-lined sands of Sanibel Island , off Fort Myers on the Gulf Coast side of Florida . The intensive collector gets shells any way he can  --  buying , trading , fishing , trawling , digging , diving , etc.  --  but if he is an old hand at the game , he will let a hermit crab do the work for him . This little creature lives in a shell to protect an extremely tender section of his anatomy . If the collector takes away his shell , this important-looking crab will march into the sea , pick up a new one and lug it ashore . With luck , it will be a good one .
