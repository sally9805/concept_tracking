In Albuquerque last week , Maytag distributors sold four carloads of home freezers , about 25% more than they normally sell in a whole year . Reason for the jump : the distributors offered guarantees to provide frozen foods at " wholesale " prices , i.e. , what supermarkets pay-anywhere from 20% to 30% below retail prices . <P> To do this , Maytag 's Rocky Mountain distributors made deals to buy bulk lots from big frozen-food wholesalers ( including such top brands as Birds Eye , Snow Crop , Pictsweet , etc. ) , then passed the goods on to freezer buyers without additional markups . Explained Maytag 's Santa Fe Manager John McCauley : " We 're not interested in making money on food but in selling freezers . " For buyers , it meant some notable savings : 17 for frozen peas v. 23 in Santa Fe chain stores , 32 for Brussels sprouts v. 41 , 68 for salmon fillets v. 95 . <P> Some retailers counterattacked , hinted in ads that " wholesale " meats would prove inferior . Other grocers , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than fight it . One big Santa Fe supermarket ( Batrite ) agreed to sell meats in quantity to Maytag customers at only 8 above wholesale prices . Said Manager Charles Batts : " I 'd rather make a few cents a pound and get rid of a big quantity of meat than make a lot more and have to peddle it in little pieces . " <P> What 's the Benefit ? The Rocky Mountain experiment looked like a tie-in between big freezer makers and big frozen-food processors , though both , ( out of fear of retaliation by retailers ) were letting local agents handle things on an " independent " basis . But the selling of home freezers together with frozen foods at discount prices is already a tremendous new U.S. merchandising phenomenon . So-called " food plans " have been springing up all over the map . <P> California has 118 in operation , and in San Francisco home freezers have squeezed out TV sets as the No. i seller in home appliances . In Los Angeles , Sears , Roebuck is selling its Coldspot freezers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below retail prices ; the Bank of America is financing the Sears food plan on six-month loans . Big Amana Refrigeration , Inc . ( TIME , Jan. 16 , 1950 ) , which makes freezers for Maytag , got a head start on the freezer boom because one of its distributors , John Bess , pioneered one of the biggest food plans in the East . Through his Freezer Owners Association of America , Bess has made his pitch in 22 East Coast cities , including New York , Philadelphia and Providence ; last year he moved $3,000,000 worth of freezers and 2,000,000 Ibs. of frozen foods in Metropolitan New York alone . He estimates his plan saves buyers an average of 15% on frozen foods .
