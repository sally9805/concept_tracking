From the day he enrolled last summer at Memphis State College , 23-year-old John Robert Starr appeared to be a model student . A shaggy-haired ex-G.I. with a wife and two children , Starr managed to get As and Bs in all his courses . He was also sports editor of the college annual , wrote a column for the college paper , covered high-school sports for the Memphis Commercial Appeal , and on Sundays held down a job as a reporter for the United Press . The dean 's office thought his load was a heavy one , but saw no particular reason to ask Starr to ease it . <P> Then , last fortnight , the office began to hear some strange rumors about Student Starr-so strange , in fact , that at first the dean could not believe them . But just as a precaution , he called Starr in and asked him pointblank if the rumors were true . Yes , Starr admitted , they were : ever since he had been at State , he had also been a full-time student at Southwestern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the G.I. bill , he was well into his senior year , and his record was every bit as good as it was at State . He was making As and Bs , was sports editor of the annual , wrote a column for the paper , covered campus news for the Appeal . The only trouble with Southwestern , said Starr , was that it did n't keep him busy enough : " There were so many subjects I wanted to learn about . And being lazy by nature , I thought it would be good self-discipline to sign up for them . " When Southwestern could not give him all the courses he wanted , he had simply enrolled at State , paying the tuition out of his own pocket . <P> Neither college suspected his double life . Neither knew that promptly at 8:30 a.m. every Monday , Wednesday and Friday , Starr would start out at Southwestern , attend courses until noon , then motorcycle over to State for classes until 3 , or to one of his many jobs . On Tuesdays , Thursdays and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State and most afternoons at Southwestern . <P> As the months passed , Starr seemed to thrive under his double routine , even though it meant working far into the night and often over a bewildering assortment of courses-Greek for Southwestern , business law for State , biology for Southwestern , mythology for State . Meanwhile , he happily pursued his extracurricular jobs . He never lost a pound , never appeared tired , and his work never fell off . Last week , Memphis State decided that college policy could no longer permit such goings-on , and Starr reluctantly resigned from the campus . But that did not mean that he intended to change his habits much . " I 've got to find something to do on Tuesdays , Thursdays and Saturdays now that I 've left State , " he said last week . " I 'll just go crazy with all this time on my hands . "
