In Rome 's Teatro Adriano , where Mussolini used to hold Blackshirt rallies , Italian Communists gathered last week for a long-delayed seventh national party congress . Peace-Red style-was the battle cry of 748 delegates and more than 1,000 special guests . <P> The party had come a long way-mostly downgrade-since the sixth congress three years ago . It had been crushed in the 1948 national elections . Its dominance over Italy 's trade unions had been seriously challenged by the rise of the anti-Communist CISL ( Confederazione Italiana Sindacati Liberi ) ; its recent attempts at political strikes had fizzled miserably ; its strong-arm squads had been routed and its hidden arsenals uncovered by Interior Minister Mario Scelba 's security forces . Internal defection , led by Valdo Magnani and Aldo Cucchi ( TIME , Feb. 12 ) , had rocked it to its heels . What the party needed at an obviously low ebb was a shot of optimism . The No . I comrade , Palmiro Togliatti , just back from a cure in Moscow , gave it to them . <P> Old Line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paler and far less robust than three years before . " Never mind a few misguided defections , " he counseled . " Comrades , we have immense potential allies : the whole Italian proletariat and the population of the Italian South . We will find allies even among the lower echelons of the bourgeoisie , now faced with economic annihilation . " <P> Togliatti denounced the Christian Democratic government of Premier Alcide de Gasperi as " the government of war , of no social reform , of rising prices . . . " Then Togliatti turned his attention to foreign affairs . <P> " The United States , " he cried , " have become the emergency states , and have oriented everything towards preparations for war , and have forced and are forcing the whole world , and particularly the nations under their direct control , such as Italy , to follow the same path . " <P> He loved the new Red China : " Its strength of 450 million men , comrades , 450 million men powerfully organized-politically , economically and militarily organized-with a huge military organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings a message ... of redemption to the downtrodden masses of Asia and throughout the empires . " Soviet Russia , too , had a message of redemption : it had achieved " grandiose strides of socialist economy . . . and capitalist nations have lagged far behind . . . " <P> New Line . All this sounded like a stereotyped harangue of Communism anywhere . It was apparently an attempt to show that Togliatti was leading from strength-the strength of the Red world bloc-for a new Italian political and propaganda line . In place of opposition to the government , the party boss offered cooperation-at a price . " We are ready to withdraw all opposition to the government , " he proclaimed , " if it will modify its foreign policy . " Specifically , Togliatti demanded Italy 's withdrawal from the North Atlantic defense alliance and from its support of U.N . action in Korea .
