U.S. educators have long been warning that the U.S.S.R. is turning out scientists and engineers at an alarming rate . But what is the Soviet educational system like as a whole ? Last week , in a special report published by the National Science Foundation . Nicholas DeWitt of Harvard 's Russian Research Center gave as definitive an answer as anyone has given thus far . From Soviet statistics and publications , and from tales of refugees and foreign observers . Expert DeWitt has pieced together a bleak picture of a onesided education that is wholly in the service of the state . <P> The Big Difference . Though the Russians boast loudly of providing education for all . their school system is not as democratic as it sounds . The regular ten-year elementary and secondary program is merciless : in 1954. less than 126 out of every 1,000 pupils who had started it managed to survive for graduation . But the big difference between U.S. and Soviet education is a matter of emphasis . Foreign languages and geography get far more attention in the U.S.S.R. , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and science . This , says Expert DeWitt , is a " distinctive feature of Soviet secondary education . " <P> Once a pupil has graduated at 17. he is ready to try for one of Russia 's 33 universities , 800 technical institutes , or the various extension and correspondence courses offered . If he passes the necessary examinations , he immediately embarks on a course of study that soon narrows down to a tiny specialty . The five broad branches of study in Soviet professional education consist of 24 fields which are broken down into 295 specialties . These are further fragmented into 450 specializations which in turn are broken up into 510 subspecializations . There are no optional courses and no electives ; nor does a student spend much time in any form of general education . A science major , for instance , spends 27% of his time in general science and 67% in his special field . The remaining 6% goes into a form of political science that is largely party-line indoctrination . <P> Astounding Mediocrity . Within five days after the student graduates ( about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a job which he usually keeps for at least three years . Once this ordeal is over , a few students are allowed to take advanced work leading to a candidate degree or eventually to a doctorate . As in his undergraduate days , each student must defend his thesis in public , and many of these theses , says Expert DeWitt , are of high caliber . But the quality varies , largely because of pressure from the government for practical and applied research . " A dissertation for the doctor of science degree on the design of depth pumps for oil wells is of questionable scientific value , and the mediocrity of a candidate degree dissertation on mobile machine-repair shops in agriculture is astounding.
