" We expected big trouble when the season 's main flood waters hit the dam-and we have got it , " said a dispirited game warden last week as he stood on the banks of Rhodesia 's man-made Kariba lake . Before his weary , red-rimmed eyes lay a vast tract of drowning land . Two hundred yards away a dozen monkeys clung to the rocky crown of a tiny island that was being swallowed up in the dappled waters . The monkeys ' ribs showed through their shrunken skin , their liquid , pleading eyes turned desperately this way and that . <P> Brown Fruit . The artificial lake , formed by the mighty Zambesi River , stretches back 110 miles toward the pluming spray of the 350-ft . Victoria Falls . It is held in check by the towering new Kariba dam , hailed as the greatest piece of masonry in Africa since the days of the Pharaohs . The simple Batonga tribesmen who lived in the valley for centuries had-with difficulty-been evacuated to higher ground ( TIME . Dec. 15 ) . Now it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's richest game sanctuaries , and there were only eleven men and two boats to do the job . <P> As the waters rose , hills became islands crowded with panicky beasts . In the topmost branches of submerging trees , baboons and monkeys clung like lumpy brown fruit . Snakes swam blindly in circles . Guinea fowl , who are inept flyers , paddled around vainly like ineffectual ducks . Civet cats , porcupines , ant bears , rabbits , wart hogs , lizards , boomslangs , and many bushbucks of many types crowded together on bald hilltops . During the day the equatorial sun beat down mercilessly , and birds of prey swooped in for unprecedented feasts . There are few baby monkeys or baboons-most have been eaten , some by their own species . The desperate monkeys gnaw the bark of their tree roosts and even attack the poisonous black mamba snake , from which they ordinarily flee in terror . <P> To save the trapped game and reptiles , the Southern Rhodesian government assigned a total force of three white game wardens and eight native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wearing bathing trunks and frogman flippers , armed with sheath knives to protect themselves from crocodiles , they grapple in the water with the terrified wildlife . A baboon weakened by hunger and privation can easily be captured by hand . Monkeys are more difficult , especially the vervets , who can swim underwater for as long as two minutes . The technique of capture is the same for both-one hand grabs the tail , the other the back of the neck . Otherwise the would-be rescuer is in danger of literally losing his face . The apes are then thrust into cages on the boats and later released on the shore of the lake . <P> In the Pillowcase . To capture the deadly black mamba , the wardens use a fishing rod adapted to pull a noose around the snake 's neck ; the snake is then gingerly deposited in a pillowcase . Dassies ( shrill-voiced , rabbity creatures , distantly related to the elephant ) and porcupines are deliberately driven into the water since , despite their small size , dassies bite when cornered and porcupines are armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three men to outwit a porcupine .
