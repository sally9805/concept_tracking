As the Asch Express pulled out of Prague 's Woodrow Wilson Station at 9:55 one morning last week , Conductor August Beb. his paunch taut but official in his brass-buttoned uniform , walked slowly through the train to see that all was in order . His train was not a big one : a baggage car and three coaches with 100-odd passengers . And there were two baskets of fruit he was supposed to deliver at the Asch station . For a veteran Communist who had spent years studying Marxism , the run was not much to look forward to . Beb often complained to friends that nothing exciting ever happened in his life . <P> A Wife Snubbed . When the express stopped at Pilsen , Karel Truksa , a husky railroader , got on . Two years ago he had been stationmaster at Asch , a mile from the German border . The Communists had found two men hiding in his house " without documents , " and Truksa spent five months in a concentration camp . Now he had only a small job at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down in his third-class compartment on the Asch Express . Truksa carefully patted his pocket to make sure his pistol was still there . <P> There were other passengers that Conductor Beb might have been interested in . At Eger , Truksa 's wife got on . He pretended not to know her . At other stops along the line , more people boarded the train , including the wife and children of Engineer Jaroslav Konvalinka , up ahead in the cab . Some of the new passengers seemed nervous . Two or three sat down in Truksa 's compartment , others near by . A few , as if by accident , sat down near the hand brakes . <P> At Franzensbad , Truksa got out to stretch his legs on the platform . At the same time Engineer Konvalinka got down from his cab and slipped between the tender and the baggage car , shutting off the airbrake line ( this meant that no one would be able to stop the train by pulling the emergency brake ) . As Konvalinka got back into his cab and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He whipped out his pistol and trained it on the fireman , a Communist , and ordered him to lie face down on the floor . <P> The train was approaching Asch , its last stop . But instead of slowing down , it picked up speed . On the Asch station platform , baggage men watched wide-eyed as the locomotive , a 3-ft. - high Red Star on the front of its boiler , roared toward them . " I pushed the throttle all the way forward , " Konvalinka said later . <P> A Switch Thrown . In the train , those passengers who were not in on the plot became alarmed . Women tried to soothe screaming babies . A toothless old man jumped to his feet , staring wildly out the window . " You should have seen the coal smoke and soot from that locomotive , " he said . " It came in the window two fingers thick . " <P> The train lurched through the Asch station and raced on through the crowded freight yards . Comrade Conductor Beb rushed for the emergency brake and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his job well . Beb ran to one of the hand brakes , but the tight-lipped men who had been watching the brakes elbowed him away . <P> The train swerved off the main line and sped down a seldom-used spur leading between low hills , straight to the German border . On D-day minus one , Truksa had motorcycled to Asch and thrown a switch .
