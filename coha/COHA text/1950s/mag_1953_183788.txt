Since 1923 , five Presidents have tried in vain to get Congress ' final approval of a new Cabinet post for the Government 's welfare functions . Last week President Eisenhower made his try , asked Congress to let him convert the vast Federal Security Agency ( 37,000 employees ) into the Department of Health , Education and Welfare . His plan would make Federal Security Administrator Oveta Gulp Hobby his tenth Cabinet member . <P> The President 's proposal got a warm bipartisan reception in both Houses of Congress , even though it was essentially the same as a plan sent up by Harry Truman in 1950 . ( Like Truman 's , Ike 's plan was based on recommendations of the Hoover Commission . ) Truman was turned down because Republicans , many Democrats and the powerful American Medical Association mistrusted his Fair Dealing Federal Security Administrator Oscar Ewing , the man who would have got the Cabinet job in 1950 . Congress suspected that Truman and Ewing would use the proposed Cabinet job for further expansion of the bureaucracy and the establishment of a socialized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power and his well-known antipathy to socialism helped him to overcome the opposition that stopped Truman . <P> At week 's end , A.M.A. summoned its house of delegates into special session at Washington 's Statler Hotel to give an opinion of the Eisenhower reorganization plan . To reassure A.M.A. , Eisenhower and Secretary-to-be Hobby went over to the meeting themselves . In an off-the-cuff speech , the President said he had found , in the past few years , that " I have certain philosophical bonds with doctors . I do n't like the word ' compulsory . ' I am against the word ' socialized . ' " He was sure that the Government could do more for the national health if it cooperated with the doctors instead of trying " to be the big Pooh-Bah in this particular field . " <P> After the presidential party had gone , A.M.A. President Louis Bauer reminded the delegates that the door of the White House and the FSA had already been opened to A.M.A. " for the first time . . . since it was organized . " Past President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election , " from the No. 1 position in an Administration doghouse to the point where the President and the majority leader of the Senate Bob Taft addressed us today . " All opposition to the Eisenhower proposal caved in , and A.M.A. 's delegates gave the Department of Health , Education and Welfare a unanimous endorsement . Congress is expected to follow suit within a few weeks .
