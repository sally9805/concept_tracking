TOMORROW NEVER CAME ( 223 pp. ) - Max Caulfield-Norton ( $3.95 ) . <P> COLLISION COURSE ( 316 pp. ) - Alvin Moscow-Putnam ( $4.50 ) . <P> THE LAST NINE DAYS OF THE BISMARCK ( 138 pp. ) -C . S. Forester-Little , Brown ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> In man 's agelong struggle against the sea there has been more than one death-filled night to remember , and Walter Lord 's bestselling Titanic saga ( TIME , Feb. 13 , 1956 ) was bound to become the leader of a literary ghost-ship column . Authors Caulfield and Moscow are newsmen , and neither is as slick a writer as former Adman Lord . But they have raised their ships from the depths of forgetfulness and cast light into dark spaces . <P> Eve of War . The little ( 13,500 tons ) single-stacked British liner Athenia was known for comfort and informality-her slow crossings rarely attracted millionaires or celebrities . She sailed from Liverpool with 1,102 passengers ( including 311 Americans ) the day before Britain declared war on Nazi Germany , and she had hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nazi submarine U-30 , got orders to open hostilities . It was twilight , and Lemp thought she was an armed merchant cruiser-legitimate prey . <P> Lemp fired four torpedoes . One hit . It took 112 lives , including 16 children and 69 women , some of whom jumped to suicide when their children drowned . From Athenia 's SOS , Lemp learned his victim 's name . " So eine Schweinerei ! " he exploded : " Warum fhrt der aber auch abgeblendet ? " ( What a mess ! But why was she blacked out ? ) The British called it murder . Goebbels screamed that the villain Churchill had ordered Athenia sunk by British forces , to make a new Lusitania incident and drag the U.S. again into war . <P> In May 1941 , with the Uno , Lemp attacked an Atlantic convoy . The escorts got him . The British picked up 34 survivors , but Lemp was not among them . <P> Cross-Eyed Radar . The story of the Andrea Doria sinking , less than three years ago , is far better known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29,000-ton Doria revived Titanic 's builders ' claims of being an unsinkable ship . Relying on her radar eyes , she barely slackened speed ( from 23 to 21.8 knots ) as she slammed westward through thick fog past Nantucket lightship on a July night in 1956 . Approaching her , eastbound , was the Stockholm , also radar-equipped . Reporter Moscow , who sifted 6,000 pages of testimony , does not solve the mystery of how two ships with radar could collide so disastrously . The last vital blips of evidence were suppressed when the shipowners settled damage claims out of court . <P> By Stockholm 's radar , the Doria was approaching on the left , and if she had held her course , she would have passed to the left , as required by rules of the road at sea . Doria 's radar should have shown Stockholm to her left also ; instead , it showed her to the right . When the gap between the two ships was closing too fast for comfort , each watch officer tried to widen the gap , but since they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the worst effect . Stockholm 's bow smashed through Doria 's side .
