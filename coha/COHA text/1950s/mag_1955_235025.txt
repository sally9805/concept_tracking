George Maurice Lichtenstein , 49 , is a newspaper cartoonist who earns $50,000 a year by illustrating an American homily of good-humored resignation : " Grin and Bear It . " In his satirical , topical " Grin and Bear It " cartoon , which runs in more than 270 U.S. dailies . Cartoonist " Lichty " has created such harried , irascible characters as potbellied , spindle-legged Bascomb Belchmore . Senator Snort , Mr. Snodgrass , and a diabolical moppet named Otis . They are inevitably trapped in ridiculous situations of their own making . In one cartoon Senator Snort , . dressed in flowered waistcoat and bat-winged collar , tells a group of reporters : " I welcome any inquiry into my program for a foreign policy , gentlemen ... I have often wondered what it is myself . " Last week Cartoonist Lichty was forced to grin and bear a real-life situation as ludicrous as any he has ever drawn . At his desk alongside the city room of the San Francisco Chronicle , Lichty got the surprising news that " Grin and Bear It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to Hearst 's competing Call-Bulletin ( circ. 136,572 ) . But the Chicago Sun-Times syndicate , which owns " Grin and Bear It " and dictated the move , reckoned without Cartoonist Lichty . On the News . The cartoon , said Lichty , might be moved , but no one could move the cartoonist . With the enthusiastic approval of the Chronicle 's editors . Lichty announced that he will stay on at his Chronicle desk even though he will be working for an opposition paper . Lichty wants to stay near the newsroom he knows because he likes to keep his lampoonery of everyday situations tied firmly to the news . Reported the assistant to a corporation president in one recent Lichty cartoon : " A guaranteed annual wage , a guaranteed annual bonus , a guaranteed pension plan is fine with the employees , chief . Except they would like a guarantee you wo n't go broke . " Lichty 's one-panel situations take place everywhere , from the home ( wife to husband : " I cook , wash dishes , keep house day after day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swagger in with a paycheck " ) to the college ( president to professor : " Nonsense , Professor , you do n't need a raise . . . You 're too absent-minded to drive a car , too intelligent to want television , and too preoccupied to hear your wife complain " ) . From Little Acorns . Chicago-born Cartoonist Lichty has been making a living at a drawing board ever since he graduated from the University of Michigan ( ' 29 ) , after editing the college humor magazine . The Chicago Times hired him , and in 1932 he drew his first " Grin and Bear It . " The cartoon struck such a cheering note during the Depression that it was soon syndicated . Lichty stayed in Chicago until 1948 , when he decided that San Francisco was the place he wanted to live . Lichty gets material for his cartoons by reading everything from the Congressional Record to old copies of Russian information bulletins . Although he goes to the office on a regular daily schedule , he rarely does any of the cartoons required of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye for stuffiness spares no one-least of all himself . Says Cartoonist Lichty of his success : " From little acorns mighty oafs grow . "
