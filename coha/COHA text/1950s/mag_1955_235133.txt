Dear TIME-Reader : <P> RIO Correspondent Piero Saporiti flew over the Andes for a first , fresh-eyed view of Peru , its economy and policies ( see Progress to Prosperity in HEMISPHERE ) . While in Lima , Saporiti tried a dish called ceviche , which is popular in many Latin American countries . When he asked for the recipe , the cook said , " All you do is take a corvina a black-finned fish and leave it in lemon juice for three hours . " Saporiti asked : " What next ? <P> " Said the cook : " Next , seor , you eat it . " <P> " And so , " our correspondent reports , " I learned that for the first time in my life I had eaten a raw fish-and what 's more , I liked it . " <P> HE 'S one of the few actors I 've known who is literate enough to write , " said a press agent last week backstage at New York 's 46th Street Theater . He was talking about TIME 'S Roger S. Hewlett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VERDON , star of Damn Yankees . <P> Out of the Hasty Pudding Club and Harvard in ' 33 , Hewlett went into the Depression-years theater . When he had a job it was usually with GEORGE ABBOTT , Damn Yankees ' director . Actor Hewlett played bits and served as Abbott 's assistant stage director in Boy Meets Girl , toured coast-to-coast with the Brother Rat road show , understudying Tom Ewell , current Broadway star . In Abbott 's Best Foot Forward , Hewlett portrayed a newsman . <P> In 1940 , he quit the theater , did free-lance writing until 1944 , when he joined TIME 'S staff . Since , he has written 19 covers , six on show business . " I love the theater , " said Editor Hewlett , " but I 'm glad to be on the outside looking in . I also like to make a living . " <P> . <P> OUR direct-mail approach to subscribers , old and new , has always had excellent results . Sometimes they are even amazing . The return , stamped envelopes have brought back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an upper plate of false teeth so dull they could not bite their way out of a paper bag . <P> Recently , our Subscription Service Department in Chicago received an appeal from Subscriber Russell Stetson of Sharon , Mass . He wrote : " Could you help me repossess a watch which is probably now in possession of a part of your organization ? I will then be able to look my son in the eye . " <P> Stetson had placed the watch , belonging to his son , Robert , 14 , in a TIME business-reply envelope to take it to a jeweler . Accidentally , the envelope , without return address , got mailed with some letters Stetson was carrying in his pocket . Sure enough , the watch was in Subscription 's " Waiting for Missing Owners Dept . " Last week Subscriber Stetson was again on speaking terms with Robert : the watch was finally at the jeweler's.
