Four years ago , when the voters of industrial Jaboatao 1,150 miles north of Rio , went to the polls to elect new municipal officers , they showed their disgust with the incumbent Red-lining regime by electing a goat named Fragrant to the city council . Last week Sao Paulo ( pop . 3,650,000 ) , Brazil 's biggest city , was counting the votes after an election for city council , and once more the voters had turned to a four-legged friend . Top vote-getter ( 100,000 ) among 540 candidates for the 45-seat council : a five-year-old female rhinoceros named Cacareco ( meaning rubbish ) , resident of the Sao Paulo zoo , whose only graft is 70 Ibs. of vegetables each day . Said one Paulista voter : " Better to elect a rhino than an ass . " <P> Cacareco got on the ballot through the offices of some prankish students who printed 200,000 ballots . When the results were in , everyone had a theory about the landslide . A psychologist proclaimed : " The public chose Cacareco as an image of solidarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brazil 's politicians knew better . Partly , it was pure orneriness . It was also an expression of anger at local officials , who have done nothing about the city 's unpaved streets and open sewers . And since those officials were members of the coalition that elected President Juscelino Kubitschek , they also took the rap for Brazil 's rising prices and the shortages of such basic commodities as beans and beef .
