On April 1 , federal-support prices on dairy products dropped from 90% of parity to 75% . In the end-of-March rush to take advantage of the higher supports , farmers and food processors unloaded record tonnages of butter , cheese and dried milk on the Agriculture Department . Last week the Department finished adding up the huge purchases for the month : 87 million lbs . of butter , 132 million lbs . of dried milk , 189 million lbs . of cheese . Cost : $156 million . <P> Some of the sellers turned right around after April 1 and bought the same commodities back from the Government at lower prices . Cheese companies bought back 92 million lbs . of cheddar at 3 a lb. less than the 37 and 38 a lb. they had sold it for . The cheese was sold and repurchased without ever stirring from cold-storage warehouses . <P> Buy-back deals were arranged ahead of time , explained Agriculture Secretary Benson , in the hope that cheese processors would wait until April 1 before cutting milk prices paid to farmers . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so Benson 's kindheartedness did the farmers little good .
