Quo Vadis ( MGM ) is the costliest movie ever made-$6,500,000* worth of grandeur , violence , faith and fleshpots , glittering with Technicolor and set against the epic clash of Christianity and paganism in Nero 's Rome . The film has more lions ( 63 ) than most movies have actors ; its 30,000 extras outnumber the working population of Hollywood ; its army of technicians spent 24 days stoking the conflagration of Rome , which burned only nine days for Nero himself . For sheer size , opulence and technical razzle-dazzle , Quo Vadis is the year 's most impressive cinematic sight-seeing spree . <P> Six months in the shooting at Italy 's Cinecitta Studios , nine minutes short of three hours in the theater , the picture recreates ancient Rome with massive splendor and lavish detail . Nero 's court lolls midst pleasures and palaces . Massed legions march in triumph through crowd-choked avenues . Mobs flee the burning city and storm Nero 's palace . Christian martyrs fall to a pack of lions , burn by the score at rows of stakes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ursus the <P> Slave ( ex-Pugilist Buddy Baer ) not only wrestles a wild bull but wins the match . <P> Like the imperial Caesars , Producer Sam ( King Solomon 's Mines ) Zimbalist and Director Mervyn ( Anthony Adverse ) LeRoy rely on these circuses to keep their audience diverted from sterner matters . For all the majesty of the theme and magnificence of the trimmings , the story of Quo Vadis , based on Henryk Sienkiewicz ' 1895 novel , never rises much above the level of a good melodrama . <P> The script epitomizes the turmoil of its era in a stilted boy-meets-girl romance between a Roman commander ( Robert Taylor ) and a Christian hostage ( Deborah Kerr ) who , as the ads say , must struggle between her faith and " his powerful masculine appeal . " Between Actor Taylor 's woodenness and the coyly pallid playing of Actress Kerr , the struggle seems tame enough to justify one unconsciously comic lapse into domesticity .

" <P> Yet most of the dialogue is more literate than the Hollywood average ; some of it , evidently contributed by Co-Scripter S. N. Behrman , helps Actor Leo Genn to shine as Petronius , the Roman satirist , whose dry wit enables him to needle Nero even while flattering him . As Nero , Britain 's **25;12921;TOOLONG Peter Ustinov is allowed to hog too much screen time , but he does some expert hamming to create the deliciously malign figure of a spoiled , sensual madman . Finlay ( Great Expectations ) Currie plays St. Peter with eloquent dignity , though his long speeches are marred by the camera 's digressions to tasteless religious tableaux , e.g. , The Last Supper . In the role of the lascivious Empress Poppaea , Patricia Laffan has nothing much to do but hold a pair of cheetahs on the leash , but she is certainly one of the sights of Rome . <P> Perhaps the last epic of its scope , Quo     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
