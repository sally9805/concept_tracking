txt John Foster Dulles , the Secretary of State , declared today that the United States would not repatriate some . Communist prisoners of war if the Communist authorities in North Korea hold back any Americans . Mr. Dulles disclosed that retaliatory measures were being worked out after he had reported to President Eisenhower on his visit to Korea and Tokyo in a . seventyminute conference at Lowry Air Force base , just outside Denver . He said he had telephoned to Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor , Eighth Army commander in Korea , from Tokyo , to discuss the answer the United Nations would give to the Communist world on the growing stories of men secretly held back on trumped up criminal charges . " The last thing I did before leaving Tokyo , " said Secretary Dulles , " was to talk on the telephone with General Taylor , who was up on the front , and we exchanged some views there as to some precautionary measures to take to assure that we do as much as humanly possible to get back all of the American boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Dulles spoke only about United States soldiers , but presumably his statements on retaliatory measures also applied to any Allied troops who might be withheld . Mr. Dulles also asserted he expected no more crises in dealing with President Syngman Rhee of South Korea , who a few weeks ago was threatening to wreck the negotiations that ultimately led to , the armistice because he considered the terms unacceptable to his country . Mr. Dulles and his party arrived here by air at 7:08 A. M. Among those with him were Walter S. Robertson , Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs , who conducted the difficult pre-armistice negotiations with Dr. Rhee ; Henry Cabot Lodge Jr. , chief of the United States delegation to the United Nations , and Carl McCardle , Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs . The party had breakfast at the Officers Club and then proceeded to the administration building to meet the President , who had arrived at 7:45 A. M. for their scheduled 8 A. M. meeting . The Presidents office is there . There was no official word as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for meeting the Communist challenge on withheld prisoners . It was understood , however , that he was satisfied . Names Now Being Checked " Could you say anything more about the precautionary measures you talked about with General Taylor ? " Mr. Dulles was asked . " Those would involve primarily checking through our own prisoners of war who are returning to learn the identity of the Americans whom they know to be in captivity and then making checks to be sure they get back , " he replied . " If they do n't get back , we would presumably adopt reciprocal measures in terms of the prisoners of war that we hold . " Names are already being collected and checked as returned prisoners report comrades being held in labor camps or in prison under criminal charges , Mr. Dulles explained . Gen. Mark W. Clark , the United Nations Commander in Tokyo , stated recently also that there was reason to believe that a substantial number of Americans not listed for exchange were alive in Communist prison camps . Mx . Dulles said any estimate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the check-up had been completed . He said that withholding Communist prisoners as a retaliatory measure " would seem to be a normal proce. dure . " Asked if the counter-action would apply also to the Americans imprisoned on criminal charges , Mr. Dulles replied : " There are a considerable number of Chinese and North Korean prisoners a war who have been guilty of crimes of a serious na // ture who have been sentenced . They would not be returned unless and until we have ascertained that prisoners who have been held by the Communists and have been sentenced by them are returned . " Again , he said the only information about the men held in effect as civil prisoners could be garnered only from men who had been returned and happened to have the knowledge . Mr. Dulles was asked if there was any way of assuring that Americans in Communist hands would be brought to the neutral zone between the rival armies . He explained that only men who did not want to be repatriated might be brought there and the Communists had not reported that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also said that none of the prisoners had thus far brought any word of Maj. Gen. William F. Dean , captured early in the war . Mr. Dulles had no comment on Premier Georgi M. Malenkov 's hint that Russia had mastered the production of the hydrogen bomb . He explained his party received very meager reports of the Malenkov speech in Japan , where it did . not attract much attention . Quotes Rhee Agreement Mr. Dulles stressed that in his talks with President Rhee there were " no secret agreements . " and that " the whole world knows everything we talked about and agreed to . " He read from the original document , bearing . the signature of Dr. Rhee , this final sentence : " There are no other agreements or understandings stated or implied resulting from these consultations , other than those herein contained . " " Among those agreements , " ' Mr. Dulles said in his news conference , " was the unqualified agreement by Syngman Rhee that between the present time and the time the security pact will come into force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command and will comply with the armistice terms . The treaty will be presented to the ' Senate in January and will come up for action in February . " As for Japan , Mr. Dulles said that country " is not doing all we could hope for . its own security . " He explained that he had discussed with Premier Shigeru Yoshida and the Minister of Foreign Affal-s in Tokyo " the importance of th Japanese assuming a larger share of responsibility for the security of the area . " He said the Japanese were highly pleased with the United States proposal to return the Amami Islands . Mr. Lodge , like Mr. Dulles , said he was deeply impressed with the way the United Nations Command was handling the exchange of prisoners , providing the help that the sick and wounded needed , while the Communist prisoners were being greeted with " lights , flags and political propaganda . " Mr. Lodge also praised the quality of the Allied troops in the United Nations Command , but expressed the wish that there could be more . He told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had won six United States distinguished service crosses . thirty-two silver stars and 110 bronze stars .
