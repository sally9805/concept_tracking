The Art of Aksel Schotz ( Victor ) . Imported recordings of one of the world 's most accomplished tenors , made during his golden years ( 1940s ) . Not only does the Dane 's voice fall pleasantly on the ears , but his art makes every number-from Buxtehude to Mozart-sound as informal as a pop tune . <P> Bach for Percussion ( New York Percussion Ensemble conducted by Harold Glick ; Audio Fidelity ) . Four familiar Bach organ works rapped out on the numerous wood , skin and metal objects of a modern percussion department . The result has the effect of an X-ray photograph of a flower-barely recognizable , eerie and oddly fascinating . <P> Bartok : Mikrokosmos ( Gyorgy Sandor , pianist ; Columbia , 3 LPs ) . All of the 153 little pieces that Bartok intended for his son Peter . The music acquaints the player-or the listener-with technical problems of modern music , notably its twisty rhythms and its unpredictable counterpoint , and at the same time with a wide variety of musical expression . Performance : excellent . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Argentine Pianist Regules applies her precise and prodigious technique to six works by the great impressionist and to the special problems posed by the little Siena pianoforte ( TIME , Aug. 29 ) . The result is something special . The sound is not quite so singing as Debussy intended , yet its harplike notes are not entirely out of character . <P> Russian Operatic Arias ( Raphael Arie , basso ; Paris Conservatory Orchestra conducted by Alberto Erede ; London ) . One of the world 's best bass voices , used as it should be , in some of the finest bass arias . Included : songs from Eugene Onegin , Prince Igor , Sadko , Boris Godunov . <P> Stravinsky : Mass ( The Netherlands Chamber Choir and wind orchestra conducted by Felix de Nobel ; Epic ) . A superb performance that takes some of the controversy out of this much discussed work . It is so securely played and sung , and so delicately balanced that the music emerges rich and even moving . Stravinsky is also represented by another fine performance , his 1914 opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forces of Radiodiffusion Franaise conducted by Andr Cluytens ( Angel ) . The opening act , written before Stravinsky had emerged from the influence of Debussy , is ecstatic ; Soprano Micheau 's singing is always that way . <P> Vierne : Symphony No. 2 for Organ ( Pierre Cochereau ; London ) . Music by the late member of the French school of " symphonic " organists ( he died at the console in 1937 ) founded by Csar Frank . The music is pretentious and harmonically shifty but has a faded fascination . It is played on the wonderful organ that Vierne played for 37 years , in Notre Dame Cathedral ; its stops range from cheese-grater harshness to buttery smoothness . <P> Other noteworthy records : Nine Beethoven Symphonies , played by the NBC Symphony under Toscanini and popularly priced ( Victor , 6 LPs ) ; Puccini 's Turandot , with Inge Borkh and Mario del Monaco and St. Cecilia Academy musicians under Alberto Erede ( London , 3 LPs ) ; Ravel 's Complete Piano Works , played by Walter Gieseking ( Angel , 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
