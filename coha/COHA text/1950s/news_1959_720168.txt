txt The Civil Rights C6inmission reluctantly accepted an invitation today to examine voter registration records here under terms laid down by the Bullock County grand jury The agency at first rejected the offer because of the harsh tenor of its wording , but later proceeded with its inquiry under orders from Federal District Judge Frank M. Johnson Jr . in Montgomery . The ' question that remained to be ' settled in the month-long controversy over the ' investigation hit ? alleged violation of Negro voting . rights was the fate of Circuit Judge George C. Wallace of near-by Clayton . ? The state jurist , a runner-up to Gov. - elect John Patterson in the Democratic primary , admittedly defied a District Court order that he turn over the records of Bullock and adjacent Barbour County to the commission . Instead he gave them to hastily called grand juries on the ground that they were // needed for investigations of , charges of fraudulent regigtration attempts . The commissio ' is scheduled to report tomorrow in Montgomery to Judge Johnson on its efforts to obtain the documents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a personal friend and former lawschool classmate , should be cited for contempt and possibly sent to jail . The hearing , originally set for today , was postponed at the request of two Justice Department attorneys who are representing the Civil Rights Commission . Judge Johnson was asked tonight if Judge Wallace had cleared himself since the voter records were made available indirectly to the commission . " You 'll have your answer in a few days , " he replied . The Federal judge said that he had directed the commission 's representatives to proceed despite the stipulation of the grand jury because " I assumed that the commission was primarily interested in seeing the records . " Records Are Reviewed A. H. Rosenfeld , director of the Division of Complaints , Information and Surveys , had previously declared that under the terms of the District Court order issued last Friday against Judge Wallace the agency I would not accept the files from the juries . Mr. Rosenfeld relented somewhat yesterday by reviewing the Bullock records , made available in Clayton by that , county 's grand jury . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Circuit Court . But until Judge Johnson 's statement , the commission 's about-face in view of the Bullock County grand jury 's attitude Was widely regarded here as at least a partial victory for Judge Wallace . The grand jury slated in the report containing the invitation that the commission could see the records " by reason of our permission rather than your right . " The examination , it held , would have to be conducted in the presence of the foreman , Roy C. Holmes . The jury then praised Judge Wallace 's defiant stand and added : " We feel that the act of the Civil Rights Commission in coming to Bullock County , Ala. , and making a respectful request for use of these records rather than making an arrogant demand is evidence tending to show their new-found recognition of state authority for which Your Honor is to be further commended . " David F. Koonce , the agency 's public information officer , declared that it had " not in  --  any way bowed to any grand jury or any state judge in Alabama . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found for us to inspect the records , " he said . " The order of the Federal court provided that way , so we are satisfied . " Mr. Rosenfeld and Mr. Koonce arrived at the courthouse here at 9 A. M. accompanied by Berl I. Bernhard , staff attorney , and ' Burton Stevenson and Charles Clark , legal aides to two of the , commissioners . They conferred with Mr. I Holmes and Richard B. Stone , the County Solicitor ( prosecutor ) , for less than ten minutes and emerged from the latter 's office for a series of telephone conferences with commission officials in Washington and elsewhere . Mr. Holmes implied that they had sought to persuade him to delete the offending passages from the order . " That 's our report and there 's nothing I can ; do about it , " he commented later . Apparently after discussing Judge Johnson 's directive with his superiors , Mr. Rosenfeld met with Mr. Holmes and Mr. Stone at 1:30 P. M. - rand agreed to accept the grand-jury 's invitation :     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
