When Broadway Producer Leland Hayward went to a LIFE editorial lunch six months ago he talked about the theater . But afterward he talked even more enthusiastically about his friend Ernest Hemingway 's new novel , which he had just read while visiting the author in Cuba . To back up his claims for the book , Hayward sent a spare copy of the manuscript to LIFE 'S editors . Result : this week LIFE ( circ. 5,339,565 ) is publishing a special 20-page insert of Hemingway 's The Old Man and the Sea , the first time in the memory of publishers that a U.S. magazine has ever printed a novel complete in one issue before its appearance in book form . In two weeks Scribner 's will bring out the 140-page , $3 book , a Book-of-the-Month Club choice for September . <P> Hemingway , who got $30,000 plus from LIFE for the 27,000-word novel , controls U.S. pre-publication rights on all his writing . He was willing to take the chance of hurting book sales by advance publication in LIFE , so that more people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Longwell , LIFE Editorial Board Chairman : " Do n't you think it is a strange damn story that it should affect all of us ( me especially ) the way it does ? . . . I 'm very excited about the book and that it is coming out in LIFE so that many people will read it who could not afford to buy it . . . It was wonderful luck Leland read it and showed it to you guys . "
