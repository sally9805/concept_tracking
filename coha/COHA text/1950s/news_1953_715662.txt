txt Should participation in the conference be sufficiently broad to enable it to tackle the whole problem of peace in Asia  --  or should the conference be merely an extension of the Panmunjom talks , with the belligerents alone at the table and the agenda limited to Korea ? Should the United Nations General Assembly which meets here Aug. 17 attempt to guarantee Russian participation ? Delegates of the 16 nations which fought in Korea met privately Aug. 15 for the third time in four days to wrestle with these and related problems . The United States is faced with virtual diplomatic isolation . Great Britain , the Commonwealth , most of the North Atlantic alliance , and virtually the entire Arab-Asiail neutral bloc disagree with the American view that the peace conference should be limited in representation and agenda . They want the UN Assembly to invite both India and Russia , believing Russia essential and India desirable if the conference is to attempt an over-all Asian settlement . U.S. Presents List The United States , on the other hand , has asked that the UN side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 16 fighting participants , and that the Communists be left to name their own representatives . This would bar India and leave Russia 's participation in doubt . It would make a wide-ranging discussion more difficult . In a draft resolution circulated privately , the United States has named itself , Britain , France , South Korea , Australia , Colombia , and Thailand as its concept of a proper UN team of negotiaators . Far more is involved in the dispute than the presence or absence of India and Russia at the peace table . The United States ' allies , hoping the time is ripe to negotiate an end to the cold  --  and hot  --  wars in Asia , wish to frame the conference in such a way that this could be attempted . India is known as a diplomatic catalyst , a framer of compromises . Washington , on the other hand , remembers the political unpopularity of the Yalta agreement , a compromise , and knows that any over-all Asian settlement would be bound to involve Formosa and Chinese representation in the UN , concessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanted Britain and the Common .. wealth want Russia at the conference table for a number of reasons . They feel that without the Kremlin , any agreement would not be meaningful , if it was possible at all ; they believe that natural Soviet - Chinese clashes of interest would be brought to focus with Moscow and Peking at each other 's elbow ; and they feel that in the event the conference fails , Russia should have to share the blame . If , as the United States has proposed , the Assembly merely invites the Communists  --  that is , Peking and Pyongyang ? to name a team , it is thought possible that Russia would not be included . The United States ' Allies do not want to give Russia a chance to escape participation without serious loss of face in the process . There is still a further argument advanced for a broad-based conference . From the beginning , it has been the fundamental position of the free world that the Korean war was a United Nations collective security action , that the UN itself was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 countries which fought in Korea are entitled to participate in the peace conference is to imply that they alone  --  not the UN as a whole  --  constituted the defending force , it is argued . To be consistent , the peace , like the war , should be a responsibility of the whole UN , according to this view . Article 60 Cited United States Delegate Henry Cabot Lodge , Jr. , brushes aside this contention , declaring that Article 60 of the armistice agreement leaves no alternative . Its reference to " the countries concerned on both sides " is " clear as a bell " and can only mean the countries which fought , thus ruling out seats on the UN side of the peace table for others , well as India , Mr. Lodge says . Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold , diplomatically intervening in the dispute Aug. 14 , appealed for a " constructive , cooperative approach to the problems facing the conference " and added : " This may call'for a broad interpretation of the terms of Article 60.
