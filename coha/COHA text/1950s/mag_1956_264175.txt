In debating the merits of a bill concerning the rights and liabilities of hotel proprietors , Britain 's House of Lords found itself up against a momentous question : should an a or an an precede hotel ? In favor of an was Lord Faringdon , who begged " your Lordships to join me in making a demonstration in favor of elegance . Lord Conesford agreed , pointed out that h words that are not accented on the first syllable demand an . " I believe , " said he , " that every one of your Lordships would say ' a Harrow boy , ' but would also speak of ' an Harrovian . ' " But what , asked Lord Rea , would Lord Conesford do with one-syllable words ? " In the case of an inn sign of a public house , would he look at it as ' A Horse and a Hound ' or ' An Orse and an Ound ' ? " Lord Merthyr fell back on no less an authority than Fowler to prove that an hotel would be hopelessly old-fashioned-but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ans won out . Said aman Lord Merthyr of an-man Lord Faringdon , an Etonian like himself : " It is rather sad to think that the noble Lord and I should have been educated in the same place , and at the same time , and that 40 years later we should come here to differ upon this question . " <P> Faced with far more eligible candidates than the nation 's lyces could possibly handle , French educational authorities decided to slash the number by giving the toughest entrance examinations in history . They succeeded only too well . This month 200,000 eleven-year-olds were forced to answer questions on Andr Gide , to analyze passages from Gabriel Hanotaux , and to solve problems such as : " A group of passengers contributed 850 francs each to rent a bus . Six withdrew , so the price was raised by 210 francs each . How many people finally formed the group ? " * The result of the exam : 55% of the 200,000 flunked . French psychologists promptly erupted : " It is detestable , " said one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner . " Said the Paris-Presse : " They have created a competition for little monsters . " Last week Education Minister Ren Billeres backed down , promised to give the flunked eleven-year-olds a more eleven-year-oldish exam . <P> <P> *The rather peculiar answer : 24.28.
