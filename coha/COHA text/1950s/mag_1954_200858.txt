The National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis faced a dilemma . Not until April 1 , 1955 could it hope to learn whether the Salk vaccine , tested in mass trials this past summer , really prevented polio . If it did , inoculations for 1955 would have to begin on that same date . But it takes months , and costs millions of dollars , to produce the tons of vaccine needed for a big-scale immunization program . <P> Last week President Basil O'Connor announced that the foundation is taking a $9,000,000 gamble by ordering 25 million cc. of the vaccine now . With 2,000,000 cc. on hand , that will be enough for 9,000,000 people to get three shots each . If the vaccine proves effective , the foundation will offer the shots without cost to : 1,390,000 children who served as " controls " in the 1954 trials but did not get the vaccine ; 4,825,000 youngsters now in the first grade ; and 4,275,000 women who will be pregnant between April and September . ( These figures add up to 10,490,000 , but only 85% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine does not prove effective , the foundation 's $9,000,000 may go down the drain , along with an equal amount being gambled by six manufacturing companies . During the winter , the companies will produce for their own account an estimated 27 million cc. ( 30 tons ) , which they hope to be able to sell ( at prices still undetermined ) through family doctors for private patients . In any case , no vaccine can be released except under license from the Federal Government 's Laboratory of Biologies Control . <P> Why does it take so long to find out whether the vaccine is any good ? Last week the University of Michigan 's Dr. Thomas Francis Jr. , in charge of evaluating the trials , spelled out the answer : <P> The program requires 120 workers to tabulate reports from 20,000 doctors and 40,000 nurses on each of 1,830,000 children in the trials ( 440,000 who got the vaccine , plus the 1,390,000 who did not ) .

Beginning about Nov. 1 , each youngster will give a third sample , so that delicate tests with live virus will show changes in the concentration of polio antibodies circulating in the blood . This part of the program requires checking 2,000,000 test tubes , half of them under the microscope . It will be March before Dr. Francis gets the last word on the November blood samples . <P> Even trickier is the task of deciding whether a " polio victim " actually had polio , or some other disease that causes similar symptoms . Every case must be confirmed by virus tests . Then , physical therapists check again on the victim 's neck muscles , breathing , use of legs and arms , ability to speak clearly and to chew food , to measure the degree of lasting damage . This is necessary because the vaccine 's usefulness may be of an in-between kind ; it may not prevent all polio infections , or even paralysis , but yet cut down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
