THE MERMAIDS ( 216 pp. ) - Eva Boros - Farrar , Straus &; Cudahy ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> This first novel is the year 's most beautifully written love story . Set in Budapest in the lost era between the two world wars , it begins with a casual pickup on the Danube Corso and ends in heartbreak as poignant as the last act of Camille . The book , like the play , is about a girl with tuberculosis , but Author Boros ' Dame aux Camlias is no languishing tragedienne drowning in a sea of self-sacrifice . Instead , young Lalla is self-sufficient , cheeky , preoccupied not with " how to live but how to stay alive . " <P> Aladar , the man in the story , comes as reluctantly to love as the girl . Nearing 40 , insulated in the creature comforts of habit , he has reached that safe harbor where the winds of memory can no longer wound . He can think without wincing of his failure as a painter , of his wife 's deserting him for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seek adventures . On meeting Lalla , he methodically notes that she is a peroxide blonde , pretty , somewhat common , a compulsive liar , but all the same , rather appealing . <P> Hothouse Flush . He takes to visiting her at the sanatorium , generously pays for her treatment and embarks on projects to prepare her for the outside world she must face when she is cured . He teaches her French because her only knack seems to be a gift for languages , brings her albums of great paintings , tries to broaden her knowledge of the world . But Aladar is the pupil , not Lalla . He meets two of her fellow patients-strangely charming Franciska , gently maternal Kati . He dotes on the three girls like a fond parent , becomes absorbed in the hothouse flush of the sanatorium where almost everyone seems young and beautiful because so few live long enough to grow old and ugly . He loves the rhythms of their life , the fevered excitements followed by exhausted pauses ; he loves their talk with its curious mix ture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a civilized man on the brink of going native . Instead of preparing Lalla for the reality of his life , he is becoming enamored of the unreality of hers . He can congratulate himself that " she had picked him blindfold , out of a hundred : rejected husband , melancholy salesman of flour and pigmeal , he was changed into a prince every Saturday afternoon . " <P> It can not last . Kati dies ; Franciska goes away . Aladar throws the whole weight of his personality on Lalla , heaps her with presents and promises . In the end she blurts out a tortured " Leave me alone , " and escapes to Germany and the real world . Aladar grimly sees that he had " adored her , bossed her and sentimentalized her , until she could bear it no longer . "
