Alaskan politics seldom seem to bear much relation to the politics of the nation at large . The territory 's isolated citizenry can not vote for President , are entitled to send only a non-voting delegate to Congress , and must put up with governors appointed by the White House . Nevertheless , the Alaskan vote , cast before the rest of the national ballots in a presidential year , has accurately anticipated national political trends over the last 20 years . <P> Last week Democratic Alaska veered toward the G.O.P. It reelected , for the fourth time , Democratic Delegate Bob Bartlett , a conscientious and friendly Juneau politico . But Bartlett , who had a 4-to-1 edge last time , won this year by a margin of only 4 to 3 over Republican Bob Reeve , a bluff and hearty Anchorage bush pilot who flew north in his own DC-3 to canvass the " canoe vote . " The Democrats lost control of the territorial legislature : the G.O.P. , which had won only 5 out of 24 seats in the 1948 election , grabbed 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine seats at stake in the territorial senate . <P> Just what all this augured-if anything - for Ike or Adlai was hard to say , but Alaska Republicans were fondly certain they had started a snowslide for the G.O.P.
