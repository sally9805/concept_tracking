Easy Terms-A Dangerous Inducement <P> For the privilege of driving a record number of new cars out of dealer showrooms this year . Americans have run up a staggering bill with the auto-finance companies . In the first six months of 1955 , while installment buying of appliances and other consumer goods rode along steadily at about $5.5 billion , auto debt jumped a thumping 21% to $12.6 billion . It has gone up about $500 million every month since February , and it is still climbing . With less than eight weeks to get rid of some 1,500,000 of this year 's models , many of the nation 's auto dealers are making easy terms easier than ever . <P> The steep rise in auto credit brought a flashing-red danger signal last week from General Motors Acceptance Corp. , biggest U.S. auto-finance company . Said G.M.A.C. to G.M. dealers : " Some customers who should buy used cars are being induced through ' easy terms ' to take new cars . And some people who ordinarily would buy a lower-priced new car are ' easy-termed ' into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show what it meant , G.M.A.C. considered the case of a customer who takes a $2,400 car with 25% down and 30 months to pay ( common terms nowadays ) . The moment the owner proudly drives his shiny new car home , it becomes a used car , and depreciates 20% . Thus for the first 97 months he has the car , he owes more than the car is worth ( see chart ) . This is a danger period , says G.M.A.C. , because " customers who have paid less than ten monthly payments on their cars account for 82% of G.M.A.C. new-car repossessions . " <P> Another sharp word of caution to dealers came from their own National Automobile Dealers Association . ' ' To sign a contract which results in a buyer owing more than his car is worth-at any time during the terms of the contract-is business suicide , " said NADA 's newsletter to members . " The minute a customer finds that his car is bringing less on the open market than his outstanding balance , the stage is set for another repossession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years or five years keep customers out of the market too long . " In a business which depends on repeat trade , this can be fatal . . . It 's up to dealers to put a stop to crazy credit . " <P> Back of NADA 's straight talk is its concern that the Government might restore wartime Regulation W , which set auto sale terms at one-third down and no more than 18 months to pay . Though no such regulation is in prospect now , the Federal Reserve Board last week summoned to Washington representatives of G.M.A.C. , C.I.T. Financial Corp. , and other auto-finance companies to find out how auto credit can be tightened . <P> While the financial branch of the auto business nervously chewed its fingernails in the back seat , automen in the driver 's seat sped on to more production records , predicted that the total would reach 7.5 million cars this year , up a full 36% from 1954 . With high wages and record employment , producers figure that U.S. workers can afford to go into debt . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into time payments , said a G.M. spokesman , but " 14% or 15% with good credit would cause no damage . "
