FOR years R. ( for Richard ) Buckminster Fuller has been the gadfly , delight and despair of the technological world . Beginning with a design for a ten-story apartment house that he hoped would be dropped from a Zeppelin on the North Pole , he designed projects ranging from a house that was hung from a duralumin mast to bathrooms with no running water ( only an air hose squirting 90% air , 10% water , no soap needed ) . Among his other Dymaxion ( " dynamic " plus " maximum service " ) products have been a three-wheel , rear-engined automobile and a house that can be stowed away in an aluminum container . None of them ever went into mass production . Bucky got a reputation as a man of tomorrow for whom tomorrow never came . <P> Now , to the surprise of his many detractors , success has finally arrived for 63-year-old Bucky Fuller . His geodesic domes are popping up like mushrooms all over the surface of the globe . Essence of the geodesic dome is to frame a sphere ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with combinations of tetrahedrons ( " the simplest finite system you can have " ) , making a lightweight , easily assembled structure of wide span and low cost . <P> Flying Domes . The U.S. Marine Corps tried geodesic domes made of paperboard , found them so light that a helicopter could lift them and fly them to advance bases , so cheap that they could be left behind if necessary when the troops moved on . ( The Marine Corps nicknamed the disposable domes " Kleenex houses , " called them " the first major basic improvement in mobile military shelters in the past 2,600 years . " ) The U.S. needed a trade fair building in Afghanistan that could be flown in by DC-4 ; Fuller provided one that could be assembled in 48 hours . Covered with polyester Fiberglas , geodesic domes proved just the thing for the DEW Line radomes . Says he , with the satisfaction of the man whose mousetrap has at last clicked : " The DEW Line radomes stretch from western Alaska to Baffin Island , and the Marine Corps has almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Pole , South Pole , I 'm all around the world . " <P> Emphatically not an architect ( " If anything , I 'm a research department for architecture " ) , Bucky Fuller launched his war with traditional technology when he was bounced out of Harvard ( in 1917 ) . Bucky 's response was to develop his own brand of " synergetic and energetic geometry . " By 1927 he was consoling himself for industry 's indifference to his multiple schemes with the contention that it would take science 25 years to make his ideas feasible . He was about right . In 1952 , after a quarter-century of living off lecture platforms , consultant fees and his friends , Fuller was approached by Ford <P> Motor Co. and asked to put up a dome to cover an exhibition rotunda in Dearborn . Visitors came , marveled , and soon the world was beating a path to Ducky 's door . <P> Fuller delights in the discomfiture of his critics . When a geodesic radome was being tested at M.I.T. , he chortles , " their statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind . " Fact is , radomes have stood up to blasts of 210 m.p.h.
