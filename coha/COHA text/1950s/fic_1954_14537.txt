The inside of a tenant 's cottage , which shows , for the peasantry of the time , a fairly high standard of living . A door on the left that leads out of the house ; small windows without glass in the left and back walls , and underneath these a bench , on which lie a few articles of clothing ; in the right back corner , a fireplace , the hearth of which extends into the room farther than that of a modern one and the chimneypiece of which resembles the roof of a shed rather than a modern mantelpiece ; on the right wall , pots and pans , some hung up by the handles , others arranged on a shelf ; below them , big crocks and a copper cauldron . A goodlooking woman not far under forty sits on a stool by the fire , baking loaves in the coals . She is dressed in an apron and cap and wears blunt-toed leather shoes with bows ; but she is obviously conscious of her prettiness , and there is something of coquetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polished silver . In the middle of the room , a plain wooden table , with three stools clustered around it . Cyprian , a young man of twenty , sits behind it , facing the audience , intent on a folio , which he reads by the light of a candle . He is dressed in a smockfrock , stockings that come up to his knees and black leather shoes without soles that are split at the ankle like half-fastened goloshes . A late afternoon at the end of September . THE MOTHER Cyrus is n't going to like it when he finds you burning that candle . p. 3 CYPRIAN It 's getting too dark to read . THE MOTHER This fire gives plenty of light . CYPRIAN I ca n't read when you 're baking . THE MOTHER Your brother 's not going to like it . CYPRIAN Please , Mother , let me alone . She looks in her little mirror and tucks the hair in under her cap . Cyprian watches her . CYPRIAN I always know what that means . THE MOTHER I thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Father and Cyrus come in . The Father is a restless little man , wiry , wizened and bent , who peers and pokes about . Cyrus is two years older than Cyprian . They are dressed like Cyprian , but wear dark soft brimless hats with long flaps that cover the backs of their necks . They take their hats off and throw them down on the bench . THE FATHER ( to the Mother and Cyprian ) . It feels like a frost to-night , and the sowing 's not half done . ( He sits down to the left of the table and takes his shoes off . ) CYRUS ( glancing at Cyprian ) . If we 'd had a little assistance , we could easily have cleaned it up . p. 4 THE FATHER Never mind : when Cype is a full-fledged priest , he 'll make it up in other ways . He 'll get all our sins forgiven . CYRUS Only God can do that . THE FATHER If Cyprian 's a saint like his namesake , we 'll at least have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk , old man , and sometimes there 's a very thin line between frivolity and blasphemy . CYPRIAN Did you pick that up at the castle ? CYRUS ( looking over Cyprian 's shoulder ) . That 's not a work of piety you 're reading . CYPRIAN How do you know ?  --  you ca n't read . CYRUS I can see by the queer pictures that it is n't a religious book . ( Pointing at the page ) It 's got something to do with the Devil . CYPRIAN Is n't the Devil a part of religion ? CYRUS Who loaned it to you ? CYPRIAN None of your business . CYRUS You 're just wasting your time on rubbish  --  if you 're not doing something worse .  --  And candles ! ( He blows the candle out . ) I 've told you , and your mother has told you : no candles before nightfall ! Cyprian slams the book and stands up . p. 5 CYPRIAN ( in a voice at once aggrieved and belligerent ) . If you want me to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ? But you do n't  --  you do n't want to let go of me : you think that it 's going to be useful to you to have a priest in the family . ( A hunting horn is heard outside , and he pauses for a moment , then continues . ) You 'll expect me to beg for you at the castle  --  and yet you want to nag me at home ! The horn is heard coming closer . THE FATHER ( to Cyrus ) . Do you hear that ? It 's coming our way . CYRUS ( to Cyprian ) . Are the sheep in ? CYPRIAN No : why should they be ? The sun 's not setting yet . CYRUS Nor the chickens , I suppose . CYPRIAN No . During the dialogue that follows , the Mother returns to her mirror . CYRUS You ought to have known he 'd be hunting today . CYPRIAN What do I know about when he hunts ? CYRUS He 's usually out on Saturday  --  if the weather 's as fine as this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do .  --  I see that Mother 's got out her mirror . The hunt is heard nearer at hand : barking of hounds and shouts of the hunters . The Father peers out the window at the back on the right-hand side . THE FATHER They 're coming right across our field . There goes all our work today ! Cyrus looks out the other back window . Bleating of sheep and cackling of chickens . THE FATHER Why , in the name of God , do we have to have a baron like that ? He has n't even got the sense to have his dogs taught not to kill sheep ! Intensified tumult and squawking . CYPRIAN ( rushing out and calling as he reaches the door ) . Get out of those vegetables ! What are you doing ? CYRUS ( starting after him ) . Stay inside  --  you ca n't talk to them like that ! ( He stops this side of the door . ) THE MOTHER ( going to the window through which Cyrus has been looking out ) . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little informal call ! Tancarville appears at the door , dragging Cyprian by the arm . He is a tall but potbellied man in his forties , with a red drinker 's face . He wears high boots and a plumed hat and carries a long boar-spear . The Father slips out the door . p. 7 RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE ( to the Mother ) . Lottie , tell this brat of yours that when orders are to be given in Tancarville 's fief , they 'll be given by Tancarville . THE MOTHER ( making a curtsy ) . Be gracious , my lord , and forgive the boy ! RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE If he did n't belong to you , I 'd string him up in a minute ! ( He contemptuously flings Cyprian away . ) THE MOTHER What 's all the rumpus out there that your lordship is pleased to make ? RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE Why , a goddam son of a bitch of a hare just ran down through your garden and bolted into the house ! CYRUS ( very respectfully ) . We have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I saw it !  --  it ran in the door . THE MOTHER ( with a smile that shows a certain familiarity ) . The excitement of the hunt , my lord !  --  RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE D'ye mean to suggest that I 'm drunk ?  --  that I do n't known what I 'm seeing ? THE MOTHER Oh , no , my lord ! You know very well that I never should want to displease you ! Squawking of chickens outside . p. 8 CYPRIAN Would it be too much , my lord , to ask you to call off your huntsmen ? Those dogs are killing our chickens . RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE Use them for chicken-pie . I 've got to have my hare ! CYPRIAN The hare is not here , sir , the door was shut . RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE I tell you I saw where it went : it 's here and I 'm going to find it  --  a son of a bitch of a hare  --  a goddam sly peasant hare ! Maybe he 's a friend of yours ! ( He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reads books ! ( He throws the book into the fire , from which Cyprian makes haste to retrieve it . ) It ought to be easy to find him : there is n't much room in this hovel . ( He turns over the cauldron with a jab of his spear and goes on to knock down the crocks . ) We 'll just go through these pots and pans ! THE MOTHER ( smiling ) . You were kind to us once , my lord . RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE Ca n't lose my hare , Lottie  --  and I think he 's hiding here . ( He sweeps the saucepans down and prods at the fireplace . ) He might be in one of these boots ! ( He picks up the Father 's shoes and holds them upside down , then flings them away in disgust . ) Phew ! No self-respecting hare would nest in a hole like that ! The Father comes in , with an arrow in his hand . p. 9 CYPRIAN You see there 's no hare here . RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( He thrusts his hand down the neck of her dress . ) Maybe it jumped in here , eh ? THE MOTHER ( not entirely displeased ) . Please , my lord ! What are you doing ? The Father comes behind him and jabs him in the behind with the arrow ; then drops it and dodges aside . RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE ( turning around ) . Who did that ? ( Seeing the old man and guffawing ) Why , you damned little biting weasel ! ( He reaches for the Father , who evades him . ) THE FATHER ( pointing at the arrow ) . It was an arrow from one of your own men , my lord . They 're shooting down our poultry like pigeons . RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE By God and by Jesus , why should n't they ? It 'll keep the weasels from getting them . I sometimes hunt weasels , too . Did you ever see a dog shake a weasel ? He lunges at the Father with his spear ; Cyprian interposes the folio . The Mother comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 10 THE MOTHER ( in a low voice , exercising all her wiles ) . May I have a word aside with you , my dearest lord ? RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE Come to the castle and say it ! ( To Cyprian , pushing her aside ) Throw that book in the fire ! Who told you you could be a priest , you sour little half-baked peasant ! ( As Cyprian stands obstinate , with the book under his arm ) Burn that book up , I say ! or I 'll have you on a rope before sunset ! CYRUS Do what his lordship says . THE MOTHER Please , Cyprian : do n't be stubborn . Cyprian puts the book in the fire . RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE Put it where it 'll burn  --  let me see it burn ! Cyprian gives it a shove with his foot , pretending to push it nearer the coals , then conceals it by planting himself in front of the fire . RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE If I find you reading again , I 'll have both your eyes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lowering her voice ) When would you like me to come ? RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE ( loudly , without discretion ) . When I 'm back from the hunt  --  not too late . I 'll make you amends for your livestock . I 'm a good natured fellow , Lottie  --  you know that goddam well . Even when some fool makes me furious ( glaring at Cyprian ) , my heart 's in the right place ! ( Clapping his hand to the right side of his chest. ) p. 11 CYPRIAN The other side . RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE The hell you say ! Shall I cut you open and check on that ? THE MOTHER Spare the boy , please , your lordship : study has crazed his brain . Now that his book is burned , I 'm sure that he 'll be much better . RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE I 'll spare him for your sake , Lottie . ( Going to the door and calling to the men outside ) All right , boys , let 's be off ! Where the hell is that boar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cyprian gets the book out of the fireplace , knocks the ashes off it and looks to see how much it has been damaged . The Mother puts back the pans ; the Father examines the crocks ; Cyrus , again at the window , watches the departure of the hunt . THE FATHER ( breaking the silence ) . Four sheep and God knows how many chickens ! THE MOTHER He told me he 'd make us amends . CYPRIAN ( with insinuation ) . There 's no doubt that he likes you , Mother . I heard what he said just now . I think he came here to see you . THE MOTHER He has n't spoken a word to me in years . p. 12 CYPRIAN It must have been a pleasure today ! THE MOTHER He can be nice when he is n't drinking . CYPRIAN Which is never , so far as is known . Even the nobles call him Rody the Rumpot . CYRUS ( turning from the window ) . You 're not to talk about him like that . He 's our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CYPRIAN I 'm impressed by your self-restraint . Since you 're doomed to have your life and your work and everything you 've got in the world at the mercy of this drunken scoundrel , it 's a very good thing you were born respectful ! CYRUS The Baron is a strong man . He 's held his own against his neighbors  --  who are wolves if there ever were wolves . CYPRIAN He also poisoned his brother and put his father to die in a dungeon . CYRUS We have n't any proof of that . CYPRIAN I know what makes you stand up for him . I 've never said it before  --  but I 've known all along what you thought , and , from what happened here today , I have n't a doubt you 're right . CYRUS Be careful . CYPRIAN I 'm through being careful . You think that you 're Tancarville 's son . p. 13 THE MOTHER Oh , Cyprian , please do n't ! CYPRIAN Everybody knows about how Mother had to go up to the castle to give him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't respectful to your father . THE FATHER Oh , do n't mind about me !  --  it 's too late in the day to begin . CYPRIAN  --  And she 's often been back since . CYRUS That 'll be enough , Cyprian . CYPRIAN ( to Cyrus ) So you 've always adored old Rumpot , because you 're just as big a blockhead as he is . And Mother adores him , too . That 's the only thing you people admire : you do n't give a straw for my brains ! CYRUS Your conceit is absolutely insufferable ! CYPRIAN I think you even get a kind of kick out of seeing him make a shambles of our barnyard ! You 're willing to take anything from him ! THE FATHER What else can we do , Cype ? The lords will always be on top . CYPRIAN But we can get out from under if we 've got enough gumption to . I 'll be damned if I 'm going to go on like this  --  and when I say I 'll be damned , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MOTHER Oh , Cyprian : what are you saying ? CYPRIAN I 'm not going to be a priest , I may as well tell you now  --  I 'm going to work for Merlin . THE MOTHER ( crossing herself ) . Oh , Cyprian ! CYRUS I knew that that book was Black Art ! CYPRIAN It 's power  --  the only kind of power that 's open to people like us . CYRUS Merlin is an evil spirit . CYPRIAN So is Rody the Rumpot  --  and evil spirit for evil spirit , I 'd rather be Merlin 's man , because Merlin has more brains . THE MOTHER Do you want to work for Satan , Cyprian ? CYPRIAN Why not ? If Satan will help us , why should n't we be his vassals ? It 's plain enough that God wo n't protect us  --  THE MOTHER Cyprian ! CYPRIAN  --  Jesus Christ is not on our side  --  CYRUS Hold your tongue ! CYPRIAN  --  if our priest is his agent on earth  --  Father Fatso is hand and glove with old Rumpot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that you were going to those Black Sabbaths ! p. 15 CYPRIAN We call them People 's Rallies . It 's the only place a peasant is free . We say whatever we like and we enjoy ourselves however we like . THE MOTHER ( sinking to a chair ) . Oh , do n't let him do it : we 'll all be hanged ! CYPRIAN Listen , Mother : I made him so sore tonight that who knows but he may hang us , anyhow . When I 'm gone , all you 'll have to do is tell him I 've been a bad boy and that I 've run away and good riddance . THE MOTHER What if it got back where you were ? CYPRIAN I wo n't compromise you : I 'll take a false name . CYRUS Let him go . We 'll be better off without him . CYPRIAN Let me take this bread , Mother : it 's all I need . ( He picks up the loaves from the hearth and stuffs them into his pocket . ) THE MOTHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his hat and coat from the bench ) . I do n't care so much about clothes as you . ( Embracing the old man ) Goodby , Father : I wish I could help you . May God protect you !  --  ( He pulls himself up , then gives them a black look . ) I ought to say , may Somebody Else protect you ! He goes out . p. 16 THE MOTHER Oh , Cyrus : what shall we do ? CYRUS ( coming over to comfort her ) . It 's all for the best , I think . There 's no telling what might have happened . THE FATHER ( looking out the door ) . Ha ! that one is mine all right ! p. 17 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE 2 A clearing in the forest : a background of trees . On the left a large tree-trunk rises , with a dim mass of leaves above ; on the right a full moon in the sky , and bright moonlight over everything . Cyprian comes in on the right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ought to have brought more to eat . I 'll look like a tramp when I get there . ( He sits down against the trunk of the tree . ) And what if he turns me away ? What real qualifications have I ? A smattering of magic that I got from books . We did n't have real magic at our Sabbaths  --  I know that perfectly well . What we tried to pretend was Satan was just old Matt Fox , the cobbler , blacked up , with a couple of phony horns and a false face on his behind . If Merlin wo n't give me a job , I 'll just have to take to the roads . I 've got nobody to turn to now . A VOICE ( silvery , sweet and mild ) . Why do n't you turn to the moon ? CYPRIAN Who is that ? A figure that has been lying on the ground on the other side of the stage lifts itself to a partially sitting posture , propping itself behind with its arms , as if unwilling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masculine but soft and pale face and is dressed in pale clothes , which shine with a greenish radiance . There is a pillow behind him on the ground . p. 18 THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD A devotee of the moon . CYPRIAN What good can the moon do you ? THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD What good ? You can bathe in the moonlight till it soaks you to your inmost soul . CYPRIAN Does the moonlight have  --  magic properties ? THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD Magic properties ? Oh , dear , yes ! It charms you  --  it utterly enchants you : you never need to worry about anything . CYPRIAN But what do you eat out here ? THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD Fruits and nuts in season . CYPRIAN You do n't hunt or fish ? THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD Oh , dear , no : I never do anything so active . In the daytime I sleep and at night I bask . I hardly ever stir from my clearing here . CYPRIAN What do you do when the moon is waning ? THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD I look forward to its swelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what if the weather is bad ? THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD That just postpones the enjoyment : it gives one the touch of uncertainty without which no pleasure is perfect . p. 19 CYPRIAN But what do you do with your mind ? THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD My dear boy , I indulge my reveries  --  I steep myself in wonderful dreams  --  and no one ever comes to destroy them . CYPRIAN ( after a moment 's thought ) . Do you really find that that 's enough ? THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD Oh , someday , of course , I 'm going back  --  when I 've drunk in enough of the moonlight . I 'll be luminous , I 'll shine for them then  --  they wo n't be able to reject or deny me . ( Getting up ) You can see that I 'm beginning to glow already ? CYPRIAN Will that really give you power ? THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD Power of a kind , yes  --  or call it sanctity , rather . CYPRIAN Sanctity is n't enough : the holiest priest in our province was burnt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can one hope for ? The strong are the strong  --  the vulgar are the vulgar . They 'll always make the wars and the laws  --  CYPRIAN That 's what my father says . THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD But we can always evade them . p. 20 CYPRIAN That 's just what I told him , but , after all  --   --  THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD ( coming over to him ) . I 'm sure that you 've had the idea  --  I can see you 're a solitary : a being who can do without other people . Do let me persuade you to join me here . ( Taking him by the arm ) You could n't begin on a better night . See how perfectly divine it is ! We can just lie and drench ourselves . I do n't think you 'd bore me  --  but , of course , if you did , you could go to another clearing . CYPRIAN ( getting up ) . I 've got to be on my way  --  I 'm going to Merlin 's castle . THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must n't believe in Merlin . ( Taking him by the arm and leading him away from the tree ) Come out from under that tree  --  you 're missing all the good moonlight . CYPRIAN It is n't enough to evade them : you have to oppose them , too . THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD Why oppose them ? One has always one 's own domain  --  the only domain that counts  --  ( tapping his forehead ) in here . CYPRIAN What do you do when they hunt ? p. 21 THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD Oh , I hide , and they do n't harm me.  --  Do n't you feel it ?  --  how relaxing it is ? Just lie down for a moment and see how it soothes one  --  how it melts all one 's stubborn resistance . CYPRIAN I do n't want to hide from them  --  I want to stand up to them ! THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD I ca n't see that point of view : it 's certain to end in defeat  --  especially for a sensitive boy like you  --  you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another kind of power  --  there 's Merlin . THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD Oh , cleverness can get you a certain way , but you have to keep it up all the time , and I find it such a strain to be clever . In any case , I can tell you that Merlin 's distinctly not . CYPRIAN Well , I 've made up my mind to try it , and I want to do some more miles tonight . THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD I 'm sorry to have you go , but of course one does n't need companions : one is thoroughly happy alone . CYPRIAN Goodby . Pleasant dreams ! THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD Thank you . You may care to come back in time . If you do , you might bring a pillow-case  --  that 's the only convenience you 'll need . ( He holds up his pillow and fluffs it out . ) You can stuff it with grass and leaves . I prefer feathers , but soft leaves and grass will do for a country boy like you . ( He puts the pillow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admire you tremendously , you know , making all that long trip alone , but the same thing that takes you there may eventually bring you back  --  and I 'll always be glad to see you . The background becomes dark . Cyprian stands in a spotlight . p. 22 CYPRIAN What use are my mind and my will if I ca n't find a fulcrum to move things ? I might better be buried in some monastery than to stupefy myself like him and to lose all the sense of debasement or pride , powerlessness or strength ! Let it never be said of me that I stood neither with God nor His enemies !  --  Satan : Great Rebel Angel ! I choose you for my patron : hear my prayer . Bring me to Merlin 's castle  --  teach me those secrets of power that can make me the equal of barons and bishops  --  let me share them all with all their penalties ! p. 23 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE 3 Merlin 's waiting-room . A door in the right-hand wall admits the magician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back wall , leads into Merlin 's study . A young man , a rather dull-looking blond , sits at a little table , to the right of this second door , on which are a strip of parchment , a sand-shaker and an inkpot with a long quill pen . At his left , facing the audience and further front , is a long bench with a back , on which four clients are sitting . The first three , from right to left , are a pale and worried young woman of about the same social status as Cyprian ; a sullen elderly man , booted and bearded and of rough stock ; and a pretty anemic woman , better dressed than the other two . These three are sitting side by side , but a considerable space has been left between the anemic woman and her neighbor on the other side , who sits close to the end of the bench . This person is tall and well-built , with an aquiline face and completely black skin . He is naked to the waist and wears only dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claws on his hands and large cloven hoofs for feet . These hoofs are immediately striking , because  --  though the other visitors are nervously sitting up  --  he has settled himself , quite free from self-consciousness , with one knee crossed over the other , so that his feet are thrust into the foreground . His demeanor is dignified and his aspect rather saturnine , but he is alert , with an accent of irony , to everything that is going on . A knock is heard at the visitors ' door . CLAUDE Come in . Cyprian timidly enters . His clothes are the worse for travel , and he looks very shabby beside the others . He carries his hat in his hand . p. 24 CLAUDE You want to see the magician ? CYPRIAN Yes , sir . CLAUDE Your name ? CYPRIAN ( pulling himself up after the Christian name and carefully enunciating his alias ) . Cyprian  --  Leclerc . The Young Man , who has heard many bogus names , gives Cyprian a shrewd look . CLAUDE ( repeating the name with a mocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his pen toward the bench . ) Take a seat over there . Cyprian , acutely self-conscious , goes over and , seeing the Black Man , conceals his astonishment but hesitates a moment , then sits down beside the Anemic Woman . She has been watching him since he came in and at once shows a lively interest , smiling and displaying , as she does so , two sharp rodentlike incisors . He tries to return her smile , then glances aside at the Black Man , who regards him with an experienced impassive eye . Cyprian drops his gaze to the Black Man 's feet , which he has not noticed before , stares for a moment , then looks away . The Anemic Woman catches his eye . A VAMPIRE ( being charming ) . A stranger here ? p. 25 CYPRIAN Yes , ma'am . A VAMPIRE From far ? CYPRIAN It 's about sixty leagues . A VAMPIRE I hope you 've found a place to stay . CYPRIAN Not yet , ma'am  --  but I 'm told there 's an inn . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when one thinks what a lot of great people come here to see the magician . CYPRIAN Oh , anything will do for me . A VAMPIRE I do n't think you 'd be happy there . The bad thing about the inn is that one ca n't be sure of getting out alive . CYPRIAN I 'm glad to know that : I 'll avoid it . A VAMPIRE I 'm staying here with relatives , not far away , and I 'm sure that they 'd be glad to put you up . CYPRIAN Thank you very much , ma'am , but I 'm used to sleeping out of doors , and the nights are still quite warm . CLAUDE ( his attention attracted by the sound of this conversation  --  to Cyprian ) . You must take your place at the end of the line . ( He points with the end of his pen . ) Cyprian , much embarrassed  --  as the woman gives him a quick sympathetic smile  --  gets up and goes to the end of the bench . The Black Man moves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens , and a young girl comes in : Janet , the magician 's daughter . She is pretty , neat , businesslike , brisk ; from her waist hangs a mirror on a cord and a bunch of large keys . Everybody turns to look . p. 26 JANET ( to the young man at the table ) . Do n't let in any more people . He 's not a bit well today . He nods and hands her the parchment . She comes over to the girl at the right of the bench . JANET ( consulting the list ) . Isabeau Minguet ? A GIRL WHO IS IN TROUBLE ( getting up ) . Yes , miss . JANET What do you want to see the magician about ? A GIRL WHO IS IN TROUBLE Could I speak to you alone , please , miss ? Janet leads her away from the bench in the direction of the study door , and their conversation is seen but not heard . The girl , in great agitation , explains something with vehement gestures ; Janet answers briefly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . B ( who has been watching this  --  to Cyprian ) . He wo n't do abortions . She wo n't get anywhere with that . CYPRIAN Oh , really ?  --  of course  --  I see . The girl begins to weep , and her pleading becomes more passionate ; Janet cuts her short with a word not unkind but decisive . MR . B That 's Janet , the magician 's daughter . She goes through the applicants first and weeds out the cases they wo n't take . p. 27 CYPRIAN I see Janet dismisses the girl , who goes out in bitter disappointment . Janet comes back to the bench and interrogates the bearded man . JANET ( consulting her list ) . Mathurin Leboeuf ? A WOULD-BE POISONER ( standing up ) . Yes , miss . JANET What do you want ? A WOULD-BE POISONER I 've got an old sick horse , miss , and I just want a dose of something strong to put him out of his misery . JANET Why do n't you kill him some simpler way ? A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a friend ; it would be like killing one of the family . I just want to put him to sleep . JANET We ca n't give out deadly drugs except in very special cases . We ca n't give you poison for a horse . She turns away . A WOULD-BE POISONER It will break my wife 's heart !  --   --  She pays no attention to him , and he has to go . JANET ( to the Anemic Woman , who quickly rises ) . Valrie de Chteaumort ? p. 28 A VAMPIRE I should like to get a sleeping-draught  --  nothing deadly ( smiling ) : just something to quiet my nerves . JANET You have difficulty in getting to sleep ? A VAMPIRE ( smiling , but under a strain ) . I literally have n't had a night 's sleep for almost two months now , and I really do n't think I can stand it much longer . JANET Why have you been so nervous ? A VAMPIRE Our part of the world has been very unsettled  --  peasant uprisings and that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've come on here for a visit to relatives to get away for awhile  --  and of course I 've heard about Merlin , and I thought he might give me a sedative . JANET You may go in  --  but please do n't stay too long : the magician has been ill . A VAMPIRE Thank you . She goes into the magician 's study . JANET ( nodding in a friendly way to the Black Man , who does not rise ) . Hello , Mr. B. You may go in when she comes out . ( Passing on to Cyprian ) Cyprian Leclerc ? CYPRIAN ( standing up ) . Yes , miss . p. 29 JANET What do you want to see the magician about ? CYPRIAN I  --  I came about a job . JANET I 'm afraid there 's no opening here : we have all the staff we need . What sort of work do you want ? CYPRIAN I 'd like to learn the profession . JANET Oh , my father has a pupil already  --  ( indicating the young man at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CYPRIAN He would n't take on an apprentice ? JANET You read and write ? CYPRIAN Oh , yes . JANET What languages ? CYPRIAN Latin as well as French . I thought I might have some qualifications . I 've studied the subject a little . JANET You can talk to him about it , but do n't stay too long . She turns and goes over to Claude . She checks through the list with him , explaining each name . MR . B ( to Cyprian ) . Look out for that woman who was sitting beside you : she 's a vampire , and she thinks you 're a juicy item . Do n't on any account spend a night under the same roof with her . p. 30 CYPRIAN I see  --  ( After a moment 's pause , not wanting to expose his ignorance ) I was n't sure . MR . B She 's evidently on a hot spot at home  --  they 've probably got wise to her there . She 's desperate : she wants her blood badly . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep . The young girl knew that very well , but they do n't like to offend such creatures . The magician will give her something that will keep her prospects awake instead of knocking them out . ( Cyprian is impressed , but does not know what to say. )  --  That farmer wanted to poison his wife . CYPRIAN Are you  --  in the profession , too ? MR . B Magic ? No : not exactly ; but I know something about such things .  --  You come from Tancarville way ? At this point , Janet has reached Cyprian on the list ; she looks over toward him , and Claude looks around at him with an interest that he has not shown before . CYPRIAN Yes , I do . ( Made uneasy by this stroke of insight ) How did you know ? MR . B They all have that whine in their voices . CYPRIAN Yes : I suppose we do . p. 31 MR . B You not so much as the others .  --  You 're not fortunate in your liege lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . No : we 're certainly not . The Vampire comes out of the study , clasping a little bottle and obviously much elated . A VAMPIRE ( smiling and nodding to Janet ) . Thank you so much . Janet , in a businesslike way , nods back . The woman goes out through the other door . MR . B ( to Cyprian ) . She 's all set up , you see . JANET All right , Mr. B. ( She returns to the table . ) MR . B ( getting up , to Cyprian ) . You 've made the best choice , if you can carry it through . This girl ( nodding toward Janet ) is the one to stand in with . Claude , the young man at the table , has been picked to take over when Merlin dies , but Janet is supposed to marry him , and she 'll still be the brains of the business . Good luck . CYPRIAN Thank you , sir . The Black Man nods and goes in , immediately followed by Janet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has been annotating the list , glances in Cyprian 's direction . p. 32 CLAUDE You ought to have cleaned your boots before you came to see the magician . CYPRIAN I 'm sorry , sir : I did my best . I 've come a long way on foot . Claude returns to his writing ; then , without raising his eyes , speaks again . CLAUDE You would n't go to see your liege lord in your working clothes like that , and in such an unkempt state , and you ought n't to come here . CYPRIAN I 'm sorry . These are all I have . Claude is shaking sand on the fresh ink . He neither glances at Cyprian nor answers , but picks up the parchment and blows off the sand with a puff that suggests contempt . p. 33 Act 1 , Scene 4 SCENE 4 The magician 's study : a great Gothic room . On the right , a stone fireplace ; in the back at the extreme right , a large open double door that gives on a stone terrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; high ogival windows in the back wall ; a door in the left-hand wall into the waiting-room . Below the windows in the back wall there are formidable tiers of shelves that are partly filled with bulky folios , partly with globes , retorts , pestles and mortars , bottles and glass jars with dubious-looking objects inside ; on top are a stuffed owl and the mounted skeleton of a monkey . Between these shelves and the double door is a tapestry with the figure of the Arthurian Merlin ; to the right of the fireplace , a portrait of Albertus Magnus . Above the stone mantel itself hangs the head of a gigantic elk : the animal 's naked skull , with wild glass eyes and branching antlers , mounted on a dummy neck . On either side of the door in the left-hand wall hang an astrological chart with the signs of the Zodiac , and a mycological chart , depicting in vivid colors the various kinds of mushrooms . From the ceiling a large stuffed crocodile is suspended by the tail and neck , with a spidery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dark carved high-backed chairs : two at the left and one standing against the tapestry , directly in front of the figure of Merlin . There is a table of medium size up against the right-hand set of shelves ; and in front of the fireplace , a large work table or desk , half-facing the audience , with , behind it , a kind of carved throne , in which the magician sits . Merlin is a dry old man , with a small and well-trimmed white beard , wearing a skull-cap and a long black robe that has collar and cuffs of fur and a cabalistic design in brocade . Janet ushers in Mr. B. JANET You know Mr. B. , Father . p. 34 MERLIN Ah , yes  --  come in . ( Mr. B. bows . ) Pray sit down . He indicates the visitors ' chair , in which Mr. B. sits . Janet takes her place at her father 's left , behind the end of the table . The magician 's tone to his visitor is patronizing , a little malicious . MERLIN I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A devil who reforms in earnest , that 's a very uncommon thing  --  a case that I watch with interest . I suppose that your charming  --  er  --  companion has made the step quite worthwhile ? I have n't the honor of knowing her . MR . B It 's impossible for me to speak of my wife . You know that I 'm not equipped to do justice to that kind of beauty . MERLIN A paragon , I understand . It was her pitying you , was n't it ? that touched you so . Yes , that 's something that few women would be capable of . JANET That 's not very kind , Father . MERLIN Oh , I did n't mean it in that way ! But when women fall in love with devils , they usually like them because they 're bad , not because they 're sorry for them . MR . B She has nothing but love in her heart  --  that 's something I 'd never found and that of course I can hardly grasp . I can only perceive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity has been able to produce this wonder . p. 35 MERLIN And you 're able to enjoy that , eh ?  --  with such a different  --  moral background . You 're never dissatisfied ? MR . B Dissatisfied , no  --  I have chosen it . One does feel a little empty at times . For her to be generous and gentle is to realize her own nature  --  but , in my case , I can only refrain  --  refrain from the opposite qualities  --  and it does make one 's life rather negative . Of course I was always negative , but I was negative before , as you 'll understand ( with a deprecatory smile ) , in a more active and positive way . MERLIN Very curious ! An odd situation !  --  And what brings you here today ? MR . B ( somewhat embarrassed ) . My wife  --  is ill . MERLIN Oh ! Have you any idea what it is ? MR . B I 'm afraid I know only too well what it is . MERLIN And what is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit it , but I do n't think there 's any doubt MERLIN Pray tell me . MR . B The hoof and mouth disease . MERLIN The cattle plague ? ( Hardly repressing a grin and glancing at the visitor 's feet ) Ah , that would be a most peculiar hazard of your most peculiar case . p. 36 JANET How dreadful for you , Mr. B. ! MR . B ( to Janet ) . It 's not a fatal disease , of course , but it reminds us both of what I am  --  and there 's already enough to remind her . MERLIN Though you did cut off your horns , did n't you ? MR . B And I tried wearing clothes for awhile . But that kind of thing 's a mistake . It 's bound to be degrading , I found , to pretend to be something one is n't  --  even though what one is is  --  unpopular . So I go about frankly like this . Nobody , of course , will come near us , but then , they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd done so much for them ! MR . B ( shrugging ) . They 've been told they ought to shun the Devil . But what worries me is that , if people find out , they may treat her like a kind of leper and even drive us away . There 's been some talk of that already . MERLIN And you 've come to me for a cure ? MR . B I hoped you might know some remedy  --  though , of course , if my wife 's disease is something that 's been sent by Him ( jerking his head toward the heavens ) , there 's nothing one can do about it . He may think that I 'm trying to evade my doom . p. 37 MERLIN It would be painful to have to face that . In justice to her , you 'd have to leave her . MR . B But that would present a problem  --  with everybody here against her . She 'd have to go somewhere else . JANET ( to her father ) . How about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : we 've sometimes had good results  --  ( to Mr. B. ) but I ca n't guarantee anything . JANET He 's not well himself , Mr. B.  --  I must n't let him talk too long . MR . B ( getting up ) . I 'm sorry to hear that . MERLIN Oh , I 'm quite all right . I get a bit faint at times , but I think it 's just the dull old world that 's losing its interest for me and that 's finally fading out . One has seen things so often at my age  --  though I must say , in all my experience , I 've never had a case like yours . I really should like to live long enough to hear what happens about it . Please let me know how it goes . Put the ointment on twice a day . I hope that your determined effort  --  but I suppose I must n't say that : if it is part of the Divine Justice for God not to let you repent , I suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will recover . p. 38 JANET I hope so , Mr. B. I 'll bring the ointment myself and tell her what to do . MR . B Better not ; she 'd be very glad to see you , but it would get you badly thought-of , if people knew . MERLIN ( to Mr. B. ) . Tell Claude to make you up some double digamma . MR . B ( bowing to Merlin ) . Thank you , sir . Good morning . MERLIN Good morning . He goes out through the waiting-room . JANET I think I ought to go to see her . MERLIN You must n't think of going . Janet glances after Mr. B. and waits till he is out the door . JANET You were n't very sympathetic . MERLIN Can one be sympathetic with devils ? JANET I am with him  --  and then , his wife . MERLIN What is she like , his wife ?  --  to give her that courtesy title . Is she beautiful , as he says ? JANET She 's the most extraordinary woman . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose she 's ugly . She has a long pointed nose and clear little yellow eyes and several large warts on her face . She 's big-boned , and she looks ungainly , but she always moves around with ease and she has rather small hands and feet . People have always wondered about her  --  she 's much the cleverest person in the village , and they thought she might be a witch , but really she 's a perfect angel , and they 've had to recognize that  --  at least , they did before she married Mr. B. p. 39 MERLIN She ca n't be as good as he thinks . He represents absolute evil himself , and of course he ca n't accept Christ , so he comes across a woman as ugly as himself and imagines she 's absolutely good . I 'll wager she makes him pay for everything she 's suffered on his account . JANET I do n't believe she does . MERLIN Women always do . JANET I know that you 're bitter because Mother left you , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got along better alone . JANET Not quite alone . How about me ? Poor Mr. B. has no daughter .  --  And , Father , I do think you might spare him your smugness about the Divine Justice , when , after all , our own position is n't exactly regular . MERLIN It 's as respectable as I can make it , and I do n't want you getting involved with that devil and his paramour . JANET It 's not their fault they could n't get married . A devil ca n't go into a church . MERLIN Anybody else today ? JANET Just one  --  a young man who wants a job . MERLIN There 's no point in seeing him . p. 40 JANET Well , we do really need someone else  --  with me doing so much of your work and Claude doing so much of mine . MERLIN The time has come , I think , to give Claude a little more responsibility . He was complaining the other day . JANET I am : I 've been having him make outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry him , I wish you 'd do it before I die . He lacks finesse , of course , but he wo n't do anything silly . JANET Eventually , you know , Father , after you 're gone , we shall have to have a new man  --  Claude will need an assistant . And this young fellow seems rather bright . He says that he knows Latin . MERLIN All right : let 's have a look at him . JANET ( in the doorway , to Cyprian , outside ) . You can come in now . Cyprian appears at the door , and Janet leads him to Merlin 's desk . MERLIN Well , young man , what can you do ? What we need here , if we really need anything , is somebody to trim the hedges . CYPRIAN I think I could do that , sir : I 've had some experience as a gardener . But what I wanted to ask about was whether you 'd take an apprentice . I 've had some training as a scholar . p. 41 MERLIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe I want one now .  --  Te dcis erudtum sse . Loquersne Latne ? CYPRIAN Latne sne lquor . Lbros mgicos lgi . ( Nodding toward the portrait ) Albrtum Mgnum bne cognsco . MERLIN cce flia ma . Latne'lgit et lquitur . CYPRIAN Itne est ? JANET ta . MERLIN And why is your heart set on studying magic ? You imagine it 's a glamorous profession ? CYPRIAN Because it gives knowledge and power . MERLIN Not so much as you think , my boy . A few drugs that do very simple things : make you dizzy or make you sleepy  --  and a few that can cure certain ailments  --  though you ca n't absolutely depend on them . CYPRIAN But there are supernatural forces ? MERLIN Do you think so ? He reaches down and turns a handle set in the side of his chair . A skeleton , with a shrill gibbering shriek , leaps into the double doorway , dances a moment , then disappears . p. 42 MERLIN ( grinning ) . Scare you ? Cyprian can not help glancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Cyprian ) . You saw the wires . CYPRIAN No , I did n't . JANET Of course , you did . MERLIN Just to make an impression , you know  --  get rid of persistent callers . JANET ( to Cyprian ) . He did n't mean that for you . He just uses it for simple people . MERLIN Sit down , boy  --  that chair over there . ( He indicates the chair which stands with its back against the tapestry . ) CYPRIAN Thank you , sir . The magician turns another handle , and a pair of stuffed gloves with long fingers shoot out from two slits in the tapestry and clasp themselves on Cyprian 's face . He starts up ; the hands go back . MERLIN A little more convincing , eh ? CYPRIAN ( anxious to play up to Merlin ) . That really scared me to death ! Janet smiles to let Cyprian understand that she considers these devices childish and that she knows he was not frightened . p. 43 MERLIN But there 's always a gimmick you 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must n't overestimate us , my boy . CYPRIAN But in Hermes and Albertus and the Cabala you read about authentic spirits . MERLIN Oh , that 's all in the books , I know  --  I 've got it all there on the shelves . But I 've never cared to do very much with it . One can have most unpleasant experiences  --  if anything happens at all  --  as the magician before me here did . Those creatures get out of hand  --  and it 's not really worth the risk . In fact , the whole literature of magic is a veritable Historia Calamitatum , eh ? And the Philosopher 's Stone and alchemy , that you read about in those writers  --  that 's all absolute nonsense . Nobody has ever succeeded in making gold out of the baser metals , and nobody ever will ! All those old retorts and things ( gesturing toward the shelves ) are nothing but curiosities . I 've never had the mania for miracles , as some of my confrres have . I 'm not the real Merlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ever lived . Merlin is just a trade-name . Such power as a wizard has nowadays is mainly a matter of pure prestige  --  and the most worthwhile thing he can gain in this agitated chaotic age , is just to get people to let him alone . One does enjoy a certain position : even the nobles respect one  --   --  A tumult at the door of the waiting-room . p. 44 TANCARVILLE 'S VOICE ( bellowing ) . " Wait " ? Why should I wait ? I come first , and do n't you forget it ! CLAUDE 'S VOICE ( expostulating ) . Allow me to announce you , my lord . Tancarville , followed by Claude , bursts in . Claude , during the first part of the scene that follows , keeps safely in the background , not far from the door . RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE There you are , you village quack ! What kind of a goddam magician are you ! That love-philtre you gave me was lousy  --  it would n't raise a lech on a monkey ! MERLIN ( rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lord . RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE I 've just told you what was the matter ! I asked you for an aphrodisiac to work on the Lady Elinor , and she 's taken the whole bottle and is just as standoffish as ever . MERLIN You 're sure that she 's really taken it ? RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE Did n't I bribe her maid ? She 's had it three nights in her posset  --  and when I took her out hawking this morning , she could n't have been blinder to me if she 'd been wearing a goddam hood like the hawks ! MERLIN She may be anemic , my lord . In such cases , our potions are powerless  --   --  p. 45 RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE Anemic , my eye : she 's as juicy as a beefsteak ! She 's got me steaming and seething . If you could see her hips when she 's sitting her horse , you would n't talk about anemic !  --  and her bubbies just like great big plum-puddings bursting right out of her bodice !  --  I wake up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He gives a roar . ) MERLIN My daughter is present , my lord ! RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE ( glancing at Janet ) . Well , that little old maid is no good to me . I hope you do n't call those breasts ! And she 's probably got extra tits turning up on the wrong parts of her body the way they say these witches all have . I do n't want your broom-handle daughter : what I want is the Lady Elinor . Somebody has put a hex on her so she wo n't give me a tumble  --  and you 've goddam well got to take it off ! Hex her the other way ! MERLIN I do n't know about that , my lord  --  RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE You do n't ? Why the hell do n't you ? If you 're a wizard , you can do it  --  if you ca n't , you 're a fraud  --  and I 'll have your liege lord , who 's a friend of mine , take your crazy little castle away and string you up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunter , my lord . Do you see that stag up there ? ( Showing him the mounted head above the fireplace ) He was given me by the Wild Huntsman  --  you 've heard of the Wild Huntsman ?  --  Well , he happens to be a friend of mine  --   --  p. 46 RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE ( staring at the head in a daze and momentarily given pause ) . That 's not a real stag ! MERLIN The Wild Huntsman 's not real either , in the commonplace sense of the word  --  that is , he 's not flesh and blood . But offend him , and I give you warning that your own flesh and blood will feel it : the Huntsman can curse and can kill ! You 've heard the story of St. Hubert  --  how he was hunting and met a great stag with a crucifix between its horns , and how this stag brought his soul to God . Well , if you do n't show respect to magicians , you 're going to meet a different kind of stag ( nodding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Devil ! RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE ( softening his tone ) . All right , but listen here : I tell you this thing is destroying me  --  it 's frustrating me and making me brutal , it 's making me drink too much !  --  It 's got me so goddam hot I go out and grab the peasant wenches the way I have n't done in years , and that 's ruining my authority in my own fief ! If you stand in with all these devils , why ca n't you make Elinor love me ? MERLIN My lord , let me give you a piece of advice . There 's no spell in the magician 's armory that can operate contrary to Nature . If you want to please the Lady Elinor , you must be gracious and gentle with her . p. 47 RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE What the hell do you mean , " gentle " ? I 'm a baron , ai n't I ? That 's gentle . MERLIN I mean you must try to charm her . Surprise her by turning up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't be sulky  --  just sigh and look sorrowful . RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE You want to make a monkey out of me ? MERLIN Better a monkey than a drunken bear  --  I speak harshly , but I 'm trying to help you . RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE ( after a moment of stupor , bursting out again ) . Do you dare to talk to Tancarville like that , you swindling old doddering faker ? ( Leaning across the table and taking him by the throat ) Give me something that will do the trick or I 'll tear out your impudent tongue ! Cyprian and Janet rush to intervene , he going around the nearer end of the table and seizing the Baron 's hands and she , on the other side , pulling at his right arm . Claude runs up to the table , but not in time to accomplish anything . JANET Stop that at once ! He 's got a weak heart , and if you kill him , you 'll get nothing done . Tancarville lets go of Merlin , who falls back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 48 RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE ( planting himself in the chair in front of the tapestry ) . I 'm going to sit right here till you give me some satisfaction ! JANET ( to Cyprian ) . Manculam vrte !  --  manculam vrte ! RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE What 's the matter with a sleeping-draft ? Do n't tell me you have n't got that ! I can have her when she passes out . Cyprian turns the handle on Merlin 's chair , and the hands shoot out of the tapestry and clasp the Baron 's face . RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE ( leaping out of the chair ) . God 's wounds ! ( He turns around and sees no one there . ) JANET ( standing over her father ) . If you want to leave this castle alive , you 'd better go right away . ( To Cyprian ) lteram manculam vrte . She lifts the old man from the table and makes him sit back in the chair . He is limp , and his eyes are closed . She loosens his gown and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart . Claude comes around and helps her . CYPRIAN I 'll see that he leaves ! ( He gets hold of the other handle. ) p. 49 RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE ( to Cyprian ) . Have n't I seen you before ? By God , it 's that booklearned brat whose mother I 've just been to bed with ! CYPRIAN ( speaking toward the tapestry , as if he were summoning a devil ) . All right , let him have it , Astaroth : we 've got to pay him for that ! ( In the direction of the double doors ) You , too : come along , Cannagosta ! RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE ( falling back ) . You filthy witches and ghouls ! CYPRIAN Come on , boys : go for him , throttle him ! Give him the bum 's rush ! RODOLPHE DE TANCARVILLE ( on his way out , protecting his throat with his hands ) . I 'll have you drawn and quartered , you apes ! He retreats through the waiting-room , Cyprian following after . JANET ( to Claude ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the shelves . She picks up the mirror at her girdle and holds it to Merlin 's lips . JANET I 'm afraid he 's gone . ( She takes the brandy and tries to pour some down his throat , while Claude helps her to hold him . ) Can you drink this , Father ?  --  Can you hear me ?  --  He ca n't take it  --  his teeth are set . They stand looking down at the inert body . Cyprian comes back . p. 50 JANET ( to Cyprian ) . He 's dead : that beast has killed him .  --  Claude , go and get the priest . CLAUDE ( on his way to the door ) . We ca n't be sure that he 'll come . JANET Try to make him : we 've done him some favors , and he knows we do n't practise Black Magic . Claude goes out . JANET ( to Cyprian ) . Poor father ! He sounded second-rate just now , but he was really a good man . CYPRIAN He certainly stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling people , and he never would take any nonsense . This was really the first time he ever failed . It was just that his strength had given out . CYPRIAN I was very much impressed by him today . JANET You were n't really , were you ? I thought you were disappointed . It 's true he did n't like to take chances , and that kept him from doing original work .  --  I must put him in his room . Will you help me ? They pick up Merlin 's body , she taking it under the arms and he lifting the feet . JANET We 've got all the equipment , of course . p. 51 CYPRIAN For burying him , you mean ? JANET No : for the other kind of thing  --  the magic that 's supernatural . CYPRIAN ( excited ) . You have ? JANET Oh , yes : of course . CYPRIAN That 's what I want to learn ! JANET ( steering toward the double door ) @x Merlin 's study : late morning of New Year 's Day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there is a fire in the fireplace . The chair which was formerly in front of the tapestry has been moved  --  for the accommodation of visitors  --  to the opposite side of the desk from that where the magician sat . Merlin 's cap and robe hang on a peg in the right corner ; a long ruler and a string with a piece of chalk attached are lying on the table against the wall . Cyprian and Claude at the desk  --  Claude in Merlin 's place , Cyprian at the end of the table that is farthest away from the audience . They have strips of parchment before them . Cyprian is now more correctly dressed . CYPRIAN  --  And now , what drugs do we need ? CLAUDE ( consulting a list ) . We 're almost out of belladonna  --  mandragora and cinquefoil , too .  --  We 've been out of bats ' blood for a long time now , and we ought to get some right away . CYPRIAN Do you really think bats ' blood 's important ? CLAUDE It 's needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CYPRIAN I have a feeling that that 's one of those witch 's ingredients that 's just put in for effect . p. 53 CLAUDE It 's always been regarded as basic . CYPRIAN Janet is of my opinion  --  about bats ' blood and snakes ' tongues and all that . Why do n't we try it without them and see whether the drugs do n't work just as well ? CLAUDE Janet is a woman and squeamish . She did n't like to catch the bats . But now you can do that . There are plenty in the tower . CYPRIAN Very well : why not make an experiment ? Why not try out Number 19 with and without bats ' blood and see what results we get ? ( Referring to his list ) Well , that seems to be all , does n't it ? One thing , though : it 's New Year 's today , and Janet and I were thinking that it might be a good idea to inaugurate the year 1464 by cleaning the place up a bit . CLAUDE ( suspiciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , getting rid of some of this old paraphernalia . That skeleton , for example . ( He goes out through the double doors and brings the skeleton in . ) It 's so old that it 's ready to fall apart . CLAUDE The old master always had it . There are times when it 's very useful . It helped us get rid of that ruffian . CYPRIAN ( laying the skeleton across the desk ) . It may make some impression on Rody when he 's absolutely pie-eyed , but it would n't impose on an intelligent child . It 's such an obvious fake that it makes our whole business look phony . The new learning has made a big difference : people are n't so nave as they used to be . Janet tells me that Merlin had been losing his clientele among the more advanced people . We ca n't afford to be taken for quacks. p. 54 CLAUDE They still expect spooks on occasion , and I do not think the skeleton should be removed . Janet comes in through the waiting-room door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than she was in the first act . CYPRIAN ( to Janet ) . I 'm trying to persuade Claude that we ought to retire Old Bones . JANET I 'm going to clean out this whole place . It has n't really had an overhauling since Father first took over the business , and it 's full of the most awful junk . Those things in those jars are disgusting ! CLAUDE I think it would be a mistake to do anything to destroy the old atmosphere . CYPRIAN ( to Janet , indicating the crocodile ) . What do you think about that ? JANET I wanted Father to take it down long ago . It 's splitting along the seams . CLAUDE That 's precisely the thing , I can tell you , that the simpler people are most impressed by . They expect to see it when they come here . They 'd lose confidence if they found it gone . We call it the Hermetical Dragon . CYPRIAN But actually it 's just a stuffed crocodile , and it has n't any actual use .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head , too . p. 55 CLAUDE Do n't say " we " : speak for yourself . JANET I thought that we could fix up the big front hall as a sort of museum of magic . We could put all those old things down there . CYPRIAN A brilliant idea ! ( To Claude ) Do n't you think so ? Then the simpler sort of people could see them and feel that they were getting their money 's worth , while the scholars would read the labels and know that they were not being cheated . If we 're going to branch out now and go in for more serious magic , that will make quite impression enough . CLAUDE You know that I do n't approve of our meddling with forbidden things . CYPRIAN Who forbade them ? CLAUDE It 's dangerous and most unwise . And I 'd like to remind you of something that seems to have been forgotten . I agreed to stay on here a year ago , at the time I was offered a job as clerk of the Abbville court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be his successor . Well , I expect the bargain to be kept , and when Janet and I are married  --  as I want to be as soon as her mourning is over  --  I 'm sure we can manage the business without any third person . JANET You agreed to have Cyprian stay . p. 56 CLAUDE For a limited time , as a paid assistant . I did n't agree to allow him to decide on questions of policy . JANET We talked about the possibility of taking him in as a partner . CLAUDE The old master knew nothing about this youth . He saw him for the first time only a few minutes before he died  --  and he certainly would not have approved of what you want to let him do . CYPRIAN After all , I 'm the person who 's taking the risks . CLAUDE It 's risky for all of us  --  ( to Janet ) you know that . When your father 's predecessor , the previous Merlin , was fooling around with those spells , there were two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father never wanted to talk about . JANET But we 've got to do something now about all that equipment and the magic books . We ought either to make use of them ourselves or sell them to that wizard from Toledo who 's been so anxious to buy them . In any case , we 've got to make an inventory and find out about the subject enough so that we know what the stuff is worth . CLAUDE What I do n't like  --  I 've told you before  --  is committing ourselves to the Black Art . p. 57 CYPRIAN It 's all Black Art more or less  --  at least , that 's what people call it . CLAUDE But you 're going to invoke the Devil . CYPRIAN That does n't commit us to anything  --  we ought to know how it 's done . We 're not even sure that it can be done . And if anybody suffers , it 's bound to be me . If I should be carried off , it will show you what to avoid . CLAUDE That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Janet ) from hearing your father talk . When a magician starts dabbling in the Black Art , he may think he knows what he 's doing , but once he lets those forces loose , he can never be sure of controlling them . This may mean the damnation of all of us ! CYPRIAN That 's a notion invented by ignorant priests ! CLAUDE ( to Janet ) . You see what a crackpot he is ? How can you let him behave in this irresponsible way ? Cyprian , ignoring this , goes to the bookcase and gets out a book . He sits down at the desk , looks something up and begins attentively reading . JANET ( to Claude ) . I 'll keep track of what he 's doing . You 'll admit that we ought to find out  --   --  p. 58 CLAUDE I do n't admit it at all . I 'd rather we sold everything to that Spaniard  --  then we should n't have to worry about it .  --  And sold the castle , too . It 's gloomy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the world . It 's giving you queer ideas . A lot of people think you 're a witch  --  and there 's a rumor that I 've got the evil eye . JANET Oh , surely they know you 're harmless . CLAUDE They 'll never believe that we 're harmless unless they see us living like everybody else . If you 're going to strip the castle of its mystery , we might just as well do as I once suggested : buy that nice little four-room house that we saw at the edge of the forest and just settle down to dispensing drugs . JANET Oh , come : you enjoy the castle  --  you like being important , you know you do ! CLAUDE I do n't know : I sometimes wish that I could just have gone on raising goats the way my father did . JANET After all , I 'm not a dairymaid . CLAUDE Yes : learning to read and write unfits one for that kind of life . JANET Come : we 're neglecting our duties ! There wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to go over to Abbville to look at that child with the King 's Evil  --  and the woman with fits , too . And I want to get the waiting-room swept . p. 59 CLAUDE You 're determined to go ahead  --  with that dangerous thing tonight ? JANET He 's just going to try out a spell . CLAUDE God protect us ! God pardon us ! We might better call upon Him ! I 'm still going to Mass , I can tell you , though nobody else here does  --  and it 's in church  --  in church before the priest that I 'm going to have you stand up beside me . You 'll have to begin thinking then about making a home for your children . We ca n't bring them up in a place where devils are popping about . I hope you 'll consider that  --  when you 've satisfied your morbid curiosity . ( Janet , who wants to escape , moves away to the desk and picks the skeleton up , attracting the attention of Cyprian . ) And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that you did  --  like an alien , almost an outlaw . They 'd have a much better chance in a nice little house like that  --  a little house at the edge of the wood ! JANET ( coming back , with the skeleton over her arm ) . Go along , if you 're so eager to give out drugs . Your patients are languishing for you . He goes out . She is about to follow him , but , seeing someone in the waiting-room , stops in the doorway and greets him . p. 60 JANET Oh , come in . ( To Cyprian ) It 's Mr. B. Mr. B. enters . Janet drops the skeleton on a chair near the door . JANET ( curtsying ) . Welcome , sir  --  and happy New Year . MR . B Happy New Year . CYPRIAN Happy New Year . MR . B I hope you 'll have the goodness to pardon me for coming to you on business on New Year 's Day . JANET Yes : do sit down , Mr. B. He seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , against the bookcase ; Janet sits down on the left . JANET Is your wife not well again ? MR . B No : she is worse . JANET The ointment did n't help ? MR . B No . The truth is He 's sent us this plague , and He wo n't let up till I leave her . CYPRIAN Are you sure of that ? MR . B I know how He works . You see , it 's my guilt that she has to share , and it 's not merely a question of illness . She 's always been so brave and self-confident , and now she 's getting nervous and frightened . I ca n't stand to see her like this , and I 've made up my mind to free her . But she ca n't live alone here now , and nobody  --  not even her own sisters and brothers  --  would be willing to take her in. p. 61 JANET I 'd be glad to have her here  --   --  MR . B It 's something I 've been loth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own  --  but it 's the only place I 'd feel she was safe . I 'd hesitate to put her in a convent . And I 'll really have to go quite away : she must get well and have her own life again . JANET The only thing is  --  I ought to explain that we thought we 'd experiment a little with  --  certain things that Father neglected  --   --  CYPRIAN ( helping her out ) . We want to try some of the bigger stuff . MR . B Ah , I see . JANET We 're not going to go too far , but I 'm not sure we 'd have the approval of  --  the Power you 're trying to placate . MR . B If you 're planning to do business with my former chief , it would n't do at all , of course . JANET You do n't think that the disease might run its course ? I hate to see you give up like this . Why should He persecute you so when you 're doing your best to  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the leaders of the revolt in Heaven against Him . CYPRIAN Were you really ? p. 62 JANET But that was so long ago ! MR . B What seems a long time to you means nothing to us who must live for ever . And , besides , I had rather an important rank in the kingdom that we afterwards founded ; and from the time that you men became civilized , that Kingdom was of vital importance to Him . The whole prestige of the higher regime now depends on the stability of the lower one , and it wo n't do , from His point of view , to have Satan 's morale shaken ( with a sad but sardonic smile ) by the voluntary resignation of one of his top men . CYPRIAN That seems extremely unfair ! MR . B I can no longer venture to criticize . I can only accept my position if the decree is relentless against me.  --  Because what can I do ? It 's my nature itself that 's infecting her and making her waste away  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was moved by love  --  but it was only her love that moved me . My cold heart was just the same . I could admire : I 'm a prince , after all , and I recognize all that is excellent . But I could n't give back her love , and my contact is killing her now . JANET That ca n't be correct , Mr. B. If you were really as loveless as that , you would n't be worried about her . I think that you 're very unselfish . There 's something  --  something noble about you . p. 63 CYPRIAN ( to Janet , becoming uncomfortable at the note of admiration for Mr. B. ) . Do n't you think it might be worth while to talk to him about our experiments ? JANET You talk to him : I have to clean house . ( She gets up . ) But what about your wife , in the meantime ? MR . B I 'll have to think of something else . After all , there 's always the convent . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take her , Mr. B.  --  I 'd be glad to . I 'll come down tomorrow morning  --  if everything 's all right up here . MR . B I sha n't count on you  --  but thank you for your kindness . I value it all the more because you know I can never repay it . I ca n't give you back good for good . JANET ( curtsying to Mr. B. ) . Do n't worry about that , Mr. B. It always does us good to see you .  --  I hope that the New Year will bring you more luck than the last . MR . B ( rising and bowing ) . I can at least return your kind wishes . Janet goes out through the waiting-room door , on her way picking up the skeleton . p. 64 MR . B ( to Cyprian , smiling ) . This is one of the only holidays that a devil can legitimately celebrate . CYPRIAN Oh , because they 're all saints ' days ! Well , you do n't miss much : our so-called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake down their congregations ! Cyprian goes over and seats himself in the chair in which Janet has been sitting . Mr. B. resumes his seat . MR . B So you 're going in for real magic . CYPRIAN Yes  --  the old man had dropped all that  --  and we thought that we ought to find out  --  what it was all about . MR . B Beginning with what exactly ? CYPRIAN Well , we thought that we ought to know something about  --  what 's vulgarly called the Black Art . MR . B I 'm afraid I ca n't advise you there . CYPRIAN No , of course  --  I suppose not . MR . B You understand my position  --   --  CYPRIAN Yes : of course  --  I did n't mean  --   --  MR . B I do n't work with them any more ; but on the other hand , it would n't be proper for me to give their secrets away . p. 65 CYPRIAN I did n't mean to be indiscreet , but you know you did give me some good advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B Not on anything of official importance . Now , tell me : are you going to take over ? CYPRIAN You mean for what we 're doing today . MR . B No : the business . CYPRIAN ( hastily ) . Oh , no : I 'm just helping out . MR . B It ought n't to be difficult for you to have the field to yourself . CYPRIAN I do n't want to  --  I do n't think I ought to : after all , Claude got here first . Merlin had promised it to him . MR . B And promised him Janet . CYPRIAN Yes .  --  It would be wrong of me to take it away from him . MR . B Wrong ? CYPRIAN I 've thought it all over carefully , and I ca n't  --  it 's out of the question . I ca n't commit such an injustice . MR . B What do you mean , an injustice ? CYPRIAN Why , I came here  --  deserted my parents  --  to get away from our brute of a baron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's made all his vassals loathe him . How can I do the same thing to Claude ? I resent his attitude toward me , but at the same time I 'm abler than he is , and I do n't want to abuse my advantage . I do n't want to base my power on cruelty to people who are weaker than I. p. 66 MR . B You do want a position of power ? CYPRIAN Yes , of course ; but I 'll learn the trade here and then set up on my own . MR . B Do you think you 'll be able to work with them , your relationships being what they are ? Claude will be jealous of you . CYPRIAN I 'm not trying to get him out  --  I 'm not making love to Janet . I 'm sure she would n't want me if I did . MR . B What makes you so sure of that ? CYPRIAN Why , women do n't like me , and I do n't like them . My own mother did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the stupidest men alive  --  because she thought that our baron was his father . MR . B You 'll live like a celibate ? CYPRIAN Yes : why not ? There are priests who can do it , so why ca n't I ? I 've got my career to make , and that I can best do alone . MR . B ( getting up ) . As I told you , I ca n't advise you . ( Smiling ) I 'm in a state of suspended maleficence , but I ought n't to work for the other side  --  and in your case I would n't know what to say . You seem to be invoking the gospel of  --  His Deputy , your so-called Savior , and that 's something I ca n't understand . You mix it with other things that seem to be completely at odds with it . I can bow to a soul like my wife 's : her love is a natural force , like the sun ; but this doctrine of pity of yours that complicates the impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in Christian doctrine  --  I 'm ready to accept Satan . MR . B That wo n't set you free from these problems . We always talked morality to our prospects . We argued with them exactly like the churchmen . But enough ! that 's the kind of thing I ought n't to say .  --  I 'll watch what you do with much interest . CYPRIAN I hope that your wife gets well . MR . B Thank you . ( Bowing ) And now goodby . I 'll leave you to your researches .  --  But be careful ! CYPRIAN ( bowing and awkward ) . I 'll try to .  --  Come back again . MR . B Thank you . CYPRIAN Goodby . MR . B. goes out : Cyprian stands looking after him , rather puzzled by what he has said . Janet comes in through the double doors , carrying a bag with something in it , a black bowl and a large knife . JANET Was he helpful ? CYPRIAN No.  --  He says he ca n't talk . JANET We ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over before Claude comes back . He 'll accept it if we 've already done it and nobody 's any the worse . p. 68 CYPRIAN Yes .  --  I 've got the things all ready . I was just going to draw the figure . He picks up the open book from the desk and the ruler and the chalk on the string from the table against the wall , and sits down on the floor in the middle of the room , where , copying from the book , he begins to trace a magic figure : a star of David that consists of two triangles , with a circle at the points of the triangle and mystic characters in the center of the figure and inside each of the points of the star . The diameter of the circle is about four feet . JANET You 're sure it 's all right at this time of day . I thought you had to do it at midnight . CYPRIAN That 's not the modern way , it seems . This book says that midnight and graveyards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The formula 's supposed to work at any time . Well , we 'll soon find out . JANET ( holding up the bag ) . Here 's the black hen . I thought it might be a good idea to have the bowl black , too . CYPRIAN Thank you . JANET It will make a mess on the floor , but it 's easy enough to clean up .  --  You 're sure you do n't want me to stay here ? CYPRIAN No . ( He has come to drawing the circle . ) Will you just hold this down with your finger while I make the circle around it ? She kneels and holds one end of the string while , walking around her , he traces the circle . p. 69 JANET ( looking at the open book ) . Do you know what these characters mean ? CYPRIAN Not exactly : they 're supposed to be Hebrew and Greek . The incantation itself I ca n't understand at all : there 's no explanation of it . Of course we ca n't be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a fraud  --  in which case we can just eat the chicken . JANET I 'm sure that there are real spells . I know that the magician before Father could do things that Father could n't  --  and I remember how scared people were , once when I was a little girl , when something was let loose in the castle . They sent me away for awhile . CYPRIAN You 've never tried any magic yourself ? JANET Not in a serious way . CYPRIAN You have done something with it , though ? JANET Oh , it was just when I was in my teens , and I was worried about not having beaux . I realized that the boys kept away from me because they were frightened of me . So I tried to work an ancient charm that was supposed to bring you a lover . CYPRIAN What happened ? JANET Claude appeared . CYPRIAN So it did work . p. 70 JANET Yes , perhaps . CYPRIAN You 've never seen anything queer yourself ? JANET I do n't know  --  I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ) . There has been something queer ? JANET I 'm not sure  --  it may just have been nightmares . But ever since Father died I have been having some very queer dreams that seemed almost as if they were real . CYPRIAN What were they ? JANET Well , I was n't going to tell you , but now that you 're going to try this , perhaps it would be just as well . CYPRIAN ( again looking up ) . Yes : tell me . JANET Well , the first time it happened it seemed to me that a young man came into my room . I thought it was you at first , and I did n't know what you were doing . I do n't remember falling asleep . Then I saw that he was dressed like a courtier . He spoke to me and said that , since Father was dead , I ought to apply to the King and get a patent to practise magic . He said the most unpleasant things about Claude and you both  --  all in a polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , somebody who was really a man  --  and then he tried to make love to me , and I fought him off .  --  I know that this sounds rather silly , but it was n't just an ordinary dream . p. 71 CYPRIAN What did he say about me ? JANET He said you were a half-baked peasant , who would n't have the nerve to put anything through , and he made me look into a mirror , where I saw a kind of living picture of you . You were standing in a forest somewhere , hobnobbing with a kind of spook . CYPRIAN What did the spook look like ? JANET He was thin and had pale clothes and a soft-looking pale face . CYPRIAN Was it night  --  were we standing in the moonlight ? JANET Yes , it must have been moonlight . What was it ? CYPRIAN It may have been something that happened when I was on my way here .  --  Now tell me what else you saw . JANET Well , the young man appeared three times . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally got him out . Then the next night a woman came . She said she was a woman magician  --  that she was interested in my situation and had projected herself here to see me . She told me what a bright girl I was and said that she 'd teach me her secrets  --  that women like her and me did n't need to be dependent on men . She said she 'd be glad to guide me if I 'd put myself completely in her hands . CYPRIAN Do n't do it ! p. 72 JANET Of course not , but the curious thing was that I half believed what she said and told her she could come again . She was handsome , though she made one uncomfortable . CYPRIAN Do n't let her come again . You can handle all this yourself . JANET I 'll try to if you 'll stand by me . CYPRIAN ( who has now finished , getting up and brushing the chalk from his hands ) . Of course I will .  --  You know I admire you , Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . You 've got no nonsense about you ! JANET It 's not true you have  --  other commitments ? CYPRIAN To what ? JANET It 's not true you 'll let me down ? That was what that courtier said . She goes to the peg in the corner and takes down the magician 's robe . CYPRIAN Why should I let you down ? You must n't take dreams too seriously . There must be all kinds of spirits trying to get in here now . I 've been having some queer dreams , too . Last night I dreamt that Claude was beheaded . She gives him a quick look , then holds up the robe . JANET You 'd better wear this . p. 73 CYPRIAN Oh , no . I have no right to : those are Claude 's . JANET You ought to assume authority if you 're going to perform this spell . CYPRIAN It would make me feel like a usurper . JANET They 've always been used for real magic . I 'd feel much better about you . CYPRIAN All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lets her help him on with the robe . ) JANET You 're going to look splendid in it . It was a little too gorgeous for Father  --  that 's why he let it get so shabby . But I 've mended it and had it washed . CYPRIAN ( buttoning the front , pleased with himself but protesting ) I feel like an impostor . JANET ( handing him the cap ) . You must n't . You 've got to be the real thing . If you do n't master our big magic , I do n't know who 's ever going to . I do n't think a woman can do it , in spite of what that creature said  --  she 's bound to get too much involved  --  that 's what I 'd be afraid of . It would make one a kind of witch instead of a lady magician.  --  ( Smiling with excitement ) It 's going to be fascinating now to see what we 've got in that storeroom . You know there 's a genie in a bottle . p. 74 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether we could get him to work for us  --  as a regular servant , I mean . We do need more servants badly , and it 's so hard to get anybody to stay up here . CYPRIAN Would n't he frighten people too much ? JANET He might , I suppose . What we really need is some kind of major-domo , who would take all the housekeeping off my hands : I want to give more time to the business  --  and we ought to have a boy or two to work around the place and run errands . CYPRIAN What about that Italian who wrote you , with all those distinguished references ? JANET I told him to come to see me . If he seems to be any good I 'll send him up and you can see what you think . CYPRIAN Claude ought to see him , too . JANET Yes .  --  Well , shall I leave you now ? CYPRIAN Yes . JANET Do you want me to look in later ? CYPRIAN ( after a moment 's hesitation ) . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a half . JANET You 'll be wanting something to eat . Do n't you want a little lunch first ? p. 75 CYPRIAN No : I 'd rather go through with it right away . JANET I 'll bring you up something in about an hour and leave it outside the door . CYPRIAN You 'd better not knock , though . JANET No.  --  Do n't be nervous . The great thing with the spirits , they say , is just to remember that you 're the master . You must n't let them flatter you or bully you . It seems that they ca n't do anything that you do n't consent to yourself . CYPRIAN What was it that went wrong before ?  --  when they had those fires and things ? JANET I do n't know . The trouble is apparently that they sometimes get people confused , so that they ask for the wrong things . CYPRIAN I 'll try to make myself very plain . JANET What are you going to ask for ? She looks in her mirror to tidy her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JANET ( glancing around from the mirror ) . I thought we were going to work together . CYPRIAN I do n't want you to be involved if anything gets out of hand . p. 76 JANET ( going back to her mirror ) . I hoped we could trust one another  --   --  CYPRIAN ( reminded of his mother as he sees her with the mirror and impatiently interrupting her ) . Must you be primping ? If you play the siren , no wonder the devils are after you ! You 've got your best dress on , too . JANET A woman is always in a weaker position if she looks a positive fright . CYPRIAN Why not leave the tempting to them ? JANET Now , do n't be nervous . CYPRIAN I 'm not . JANET I 'll leave the doors open , shall I ? CYPRIAN No , of course not : they ought to be closed . JANET Do n't bolt them from the inside . CYPRIAN You must really leave this part to me . JANET But please do n't bolt them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I 'll leave you . Good luck . CYPRIAN Do n't worry . She goes out , shutting the door behind her . He looks around toward the double door and has a moment of awkwardness , as he faces the chalk figure and the other apparatus for the ritual . He picks up the bag with the hen , hesitates as to what to do with it , then drops it and picks up the book , comparing the figure with the diagram . He now kneels down with the chalk and touches up the mysterious characters . Then he puts down the bowl inside the circle , sticks the knife under his arm , and , determinedly but with evident distaste , takes the hen out of the bag . Its feet are tied together and it does not move . He puts the book down beside him on the floor , and , kneeling in the circle with his back to the audience , is seen to be cutting the head off the hen and holding it to bleed into the bowl . In the silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Essaim , frugativi et appellavi.  --  ( To himself ) That Latin is completely cockeyed ! He looks up and glances around , as if in fear that he has committed an impiety . Then he puts down the hen , picks up the bowl , and , still kneeling , turns around toward the audience . He lays the book open in front of him . CYPRIAN ( to himself ) . I do n't know how to pronounce this language , and you 're supposed to have everything perfect . Well , I 'll follow it with a prayer of my own . I 'll appeal directly to Satan , to let him know that I 'm not just a dabbler , that I am a rebel , too . Well , here goes ! ( He holds up the bowl with both hands and reads from the book on the floor . ) Bagabi laca bachabeLamac cahi achababeKarrelyosLamac lamec bachalyasCabahagy sabalyosBaryolasLagoz atha cabyolasSamahac et famyolasHarrahya . ( Launching into his own appeal ) I kneel to you , Satan : accept my prayer . Let me prosper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Heaven , so help me to revenge my injuries against the oppressions of earth , of the lords of misrule of this world that imprison and cripple and crush . Let me vindicate against their injustice my dignity as an individual , and let me do it in such a way as not utterly to crush , myself , the dignity of other individuals . I long to be master here , but I would not destroy my rival , as my villainous baron would do . And grant me the hardness to stand alone . ( Dropping his voice , as if talking to himself ) My mother never gave me her love , and I learned to get on without it . I can get on without Janet 's love . I learned to live day after day with the scorn my mother had for my father , and compelled myself not to feel it  --  I can live with Janet 's contempt for the miserable bargain she 's getting . I can be strong in my work in this castle , and ( raising his voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch out your hand  --  I can fight against the dark forces of ignorance  --  or piety , of fear , of subservience  --  that are breaking men 's self-respect , that are blinding them against the light . Tell me , Satan , how we may serve one another ! Let me stand with you face to face  --  let me speak to you as soldier to captain ! ( To himself ) I do n't know how to close : Amen wo n't do .  --  Accept my allegiance , Satan . Still holding the bowl , he looks down for a moment , then straightens up and waits . He glances about him on either side and sets the bowl on the floor ; waits a few seconds more , with his head bowed . A knock at the waiting-room door . He looks quickly in that direction , not able to decide what to do . The knock is repeated . He gets to his feet and makes a movement as if to go to the door , but then remembers the circle and decides that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CYPRIAN Come in . The door opens , and a lean old man appears . He is dressed with some distinction in black and has long silvery hair that comes down to his collar . He is swarthy , with a long nose and a mobile Italian face . He approaches Cyprian with deference , and his manners show a certain courtliness . LUIGI ( bowing low and speaking with an Italian accent ) . Luigi Malacoda , at your service , my lord : an applicant for a place in your household . CYPRIAN ( much embarrassed ) . I 'm busy at the present time  --   --  LUIGI Pray forgive me if I discommode you , but her ladyship told me to come to you  --   --  CYPRIAN ( surprised ) . She told you to come to me now ? LUIGI ( with smiling deference ) . She wanted you to see me , and if you did not disapprove , she was good enough to say she would give me a trial . If I come at an inopportune moment , of course , I 'll retire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He glides forward , producing a handful of letters , while Cyprian still stands in the circle . ) I do n't know whether you read Italian . p. 79 CYPRIAN Never mind . If Miss Janet approves , that 's all that 's necessary . LUIGI ( holding up the letters ) . The Romani , the Ursini , the Colonna  --  I 've worked for them all in my time  --  the great families of Rome , as you know . With the La Scala I spent seventeen years  --  always in positions of trust . CYPRIAN I 'm sure that your references are satisfactory . Tell Miss Janet that I ca n't see you now . LUIGI ( bowing ) . Thank you , my lord . ( He glances toward the figure on the floor . ) I see that I have intruded at an inauspicious moment . Pray forgive me , but would you allow me to make one little suggestion ? I hope you will not think me impertinent , but I have had some experience in these matters  --  and from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were not an old hand . These characters are a little equivocal . One has to be very exact with the curlicues of these queer old letters . ( He picks up the chalk and , kneeling , corrects some of Cyprian 's signs . ) CYPRIAN That may be why I 've had no results . LUIGI I 'm not sure that it 's serious enough for that , but carelessness in preparation may have rather annoying consequences . p. 80 CYPRIAN What is likely to happen ? LUIGI Why , sometimes they like to disconcert one with roughish practical jokes .  --  You have finished the invocation ? CYPRIAN Yes  --  a moment ago . LUIGI Then there 's no need to stay in the circle . CYPRIAN I did n't know . ( He steps out . ) LUIGI I do n't want to seem officious or to push myself indiscreetly , but if you have n't got the hang of these practices , I might perhaps be useful to you . We had a good deal of this in Italy in those households in which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it needs a cool head and a very steady hand  --  if you want to hold your own . If you give them a finger , you know ( smiling ) , you 'll find that they 're trying to take the hand  --  and then the arm , and then , you know what ! CYPRIAN ( rather unnerved ) . How should one go about it ? LUIGI I 'll tell you . To begin with , it 's vital to insist on the minimum terms that they 'll give you . They 'll try to take advantage of your innocence to make you go the whole hog  --  it 's their own inelegant expression . But such a coup would only be possible with some clodhopper greedy for power . In my dealings with my masters in Italy , such a thing would not even have been suggested . Lorenzo de la Scala , my gracious prince , knew almost as much about the Old Boy 's game as the Old Boy did himself . They sold him up , I fear , in the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth  --  and what a rich life his was ! p. 81 CYPRIAN What are the minimum terms ?  --  Please sit down . Cyprian goes behind the desk and sits in the magician 's chair while Luigi takes the visitors ' seat , turning it around toward the desk . LUIGI Thank you , my lord . CYPRIAN I 'm not a lord . LUIGI But a magician has a very high position , and you , sir , if you will pardon my speaking with the frankness in which my late master indulged me  --  you , sir , show the natural qualities of one born to shine and command . A little experience of the great world , a little more polish and savoir faire  --   --  CYPRIAN Please tell me about the contract . What are the minimum terms ? LUIGI Six months is the least they will do . CYPRIAN And what is the  --  price they ask ? LUIGI You must insist on the easiest arrangement . The most important thing is not to give them any sort of claim on you that will still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . They can make it very nasty for you by turning up and exacting their payment at some moment when you can least afford it and when they 'll try to take advantage of the situation to blackmail you into another bargain . p. 82 CYPRIAN What would you recommend ? LUIGI Six months , and pay as you go . CYPRIAN What does that involve precisely ? LUIGI You sweat it out as you go along  --  to use their own rather squalid expression . CYPRIAN But what does the sweating-out consist of ? LUIGI ( smiling ) . That depends on your condition and character . But the process of payment is light in proportion to the limited term of the loan . CYPRIAN And what do you get in return ? LUIGI Whatever you ask for  --  that is , to the value of six months . CYPRIAN Knowledge and power ? LUIGI Oh , yes  --  of course , in a worldly way . CYPRIAN That 's all that I want . LUIGI Quite .  --  ( Moving his chair to the desk and picking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the sort of arrangement that I 'd like to take the liberty of suggesting . ( Writing ) " I , Cyprian "  --  I have n't the privilege of knowing your full name  --   --  ? p. 83 CYPRIAN Leclerc . LUIGI " I , Cyprian Leclerc , petition you , Lord Satan , to grant me whatever I crave of those benefits that are in your power and in the manner in which you can bestow them  --  for the space of six months . In return for which I accept the condition that I pay for these gifts as I get them in any way demanded by you , provided that this payment be not of a kind to prejudice the ultimate fate of my soul . " ( He pushes the parchment toward Cyprian . ) CYPRIAN Is that all that 's necessary ? LUIGI The simpler the contract , the better . With an inexperienced petitioner , they will put in a multitude of clauses that they count on his not understanding and that will let him in for things that he does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't say precisely what I 'm getting . LUIGI You must check on that directly with Satan . CYPRIAN But Satan has not appeared . LUIGI Satan is here : he has heard you . Ask him to accept the pact . CYPRIAN Satan , are you here ? Have you heard me ? Do you consent to accept this pact ? p. 84 A VOICE ( somber and deep ) . Do you , Cyprian , of your own free will , give me power over body and soul ? LUIGI ( reassuring Cyprian ) . It 's only for six months . ( He picks up the knife from the floor . ) CYPRIAN As defined in the contract , yes . In return for certain benefits . THE VOICE OF SATAN The power to work wonders . CYPRIAN Yes . THE VOICE OF SATAN The power to revenge yourself against the oppressions of earth . CYPRIAN Yes . THE VOICE OF SATAN Immunity from the envy of your rival . CYPRIAN I do n't want to destroy him , though . THE VOICE OF SATAN Immunity from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VOICE OF SATAN All these gifts you shall have . Sign ! Cyprian reaches for the ink , but Luigi holds up the knife . LUIGI The signature must be in blood . The wrist will do . Allow me . ( Cyprian holds out his right wrist . ) The left . ( Cyprian holds out the left . ) Better write with the point of the knife . You should n't mix the blood with ink . ( Cyprian takes the knife and traces the signature . ) As clearly as you can . It 's difficult to write with a knife . A clean pen is better  --  but never mind .  --  There ! p. 85 THE VOICE OF SATAN The pact will be kept . Farewell . CYPRIAN Farewell  --  I am grateful , Lord Satan ! LUIGI ( producing a bandage from his pocket ) . Allow me to bind this up . ( He ties up Cyprian 's wrist . ) CYPRIAN ( trying to shake off the spell by taking a lighter tone ) . How gloomy he sounds ! I 'd imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he 'd be proud and exult . LUIGI He 's very correct , Lord Satan . He 'd think it indecent to gloat . That 's something he leaves to his subordinates . ( He laughs , and Cyprian eyes him uneasily . ) And besides , of course , this , you know ( with a shade of malicious patronage ) , is very small business for him . CYPRIAN Yes , of course . LUIGI And now , shall I begin my duties ? CYPRIAN Report to Miss Janet for that . And please tell her I 'd like to see her . LUIGI Very good , sir . I am infinitely grateful  --  I hope I shall give satisfaction . CYPRIAN How did you come to leave your family in Italy after working for them so many years ? Luigi shakes sand on the signature . p. 86 LUIGI Oh , they 'd virtually exterminated themselves . Brother against brother , you know  --  mother against daughter  --  that sort of thing . And the whole thing made worse , I 'm afraid , by a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pact and slips it into his pocket . ) CYPRIAN ( a little apprehensively ) . I see .  --  Here , do n't take away that contract ! LUIGI I shall keep it under lock and key .  --  And now , I ca n't say that I hope that you will never regret this bargain : there will be moments , I fear , when you will  --  but I am happy to have been of service in assisting you to put it through . ( He bows and is about to retire . ) CYPRIAN ( getting up and coming out from behind the desk ) . Please give me that parchment back . LUIGI ( smiling ) . It is impossible , of course , for such contracts to remain in the possession of the applicant . They have to be always available for the party of the Second Part . I shall keep it quite safe , I assure you : you may ask to see it at any time . ( Bowing again with perceptible mockery ) At your service , my respected Lord Cyprian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial , shall we say ? He goes out through the waiting-room door . Cyprian stares after him , annoyed and puzzled , then looks down at the things on the floor . He picks up the bowl and then the hen , sets the bowl on one of the shelves and looks around for a place to put the hen , then , abruptly , with an impulse of repugnance , flings it into the fireplace and turns to pick up the book . The hen , as if hurled by an unseen hand , is immediately ejected from the fireplace and lands in the middle of the room . It is followed by an ugly black imp , who stands a moment , arms akimbo , on the hearth , then jumps upon the magician 's desk . He is carrying a big sling-shot. p. 87 SLINGO ( in a squeaky voice ) . Do n't you trow tings at me , boss ! I can trow tings , too ! He shoots pebbles at Cyprian , who has to duck . CYPRIAN Stop that ! Who the devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Do n't you talk dat way about our chief ! Cyprian makes a plunge after Slingo , who leaps down from the desk and escapes . The double doors are rudely thrown open , and two more little devils come in , carrying a large tray , on which are set a covered dish , a napkin , a knife and fork , a goblet and a flagon of wine . STINGO AND BONGO ( in unison ) . We 've brought you your luncheon , boss ! ( They march over to the table against the back wall , chanting Chopin 's Funeral March . ) Da da-da-da , da-da-dada-da-da-da ! ( They set the tray on the table and stand one on either side of it , like butlers . ) STINGO ( bowing low ) . Miss Janet sent it up to you , boss . BONGO ( bowing low ) . She hopes you find it tasty , boss . CYPRIAN ( after his first astonishment , attempting to collect himself ) . Thank you : you can go now . ( Turning to Slingo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . Stingo , bowing again , proffers Cyprian the knife and fork , while Bongo takes the cover off the dish . The severed head of Claude is seen standing upright on the platter , with its eyes open as if it were alive . From the moment the cover is removed , the head begins to speak , saying over and over again the last words of Claude 's final speech . He repeats them with the same intonation with which they were originally uttered and with the monotony of a metronome. p. 88 CLAUDE 'S HEAD A little house at the edge of the wood a little house at the edge of the wood a little house at the edge of the wood Stingo and Bongo squeal with laughter ; Slingo , seeing the head , joins in . Janet appears at the waiting-room door , followed by Luigi . JANET You wanted to see me ? CYPRIAN ( indicating the head ) . What 's this ? JANET ( smiling with malice ) . That was what you wanted , was n't it ? CYPRIAN I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiling ) . You see that he still lives . Cyprian looks at them a moment in amazement , then snatches the dish-cover from Bongo and puts it over the head . CYPRIAN ( to Luigi ) . So this is the beginning of the price I pay ! LUIGI It also fulfils your wish . CYPRIAN ( to Janet ) . Did you know about this ? JANET I do now . It 's what you intended , is n't it ? CYPRIAN Do n't make fun of me , Janet . You 're not on their side , are you ? p. 89 JANET You did n't want to love me , you know . CYPRIAN You 're not one of them ? JANET I do n't understand you , Cyprian . These are my new staff . You asked to have things made convenient for me , so I got what I wanted , too . They have sent me my majordomo ( Luigi bows )  --  and these boys to run errands for me . LUIGI ( indicating the Little Devils , each of whom , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate instrument , then salutes and stands to attention ) . Slingo , Stingo and Bongo  --  three brisk little imps at your service . CYPRIAN All right : you can all go now . Not you , Janet  --  you please stay here . Bongo takes the cover off the head . CLAUDE 'S HEAD A little house at the edge of the wood a little house at the edge of the wood SLINGO , STINGO AND BONGO Da da-da-da , da-da-da da-da-da-da ! They all burst out laughing at Cyprian  --  the Little Devils gleefully and shrilly , Luigi more discreetly , Janet with girlish malevolence . LUIGI ( silencing the Devils with a gesture of his hand and speaking loudly in order to be heard above the voice of Claude 's Head ) . But , sir , you must try your new powers . p. 90 CYPRIAN Can I heal without drugs ? LUIGI Of course . Touch that wound in your wrist three times with your fingers crossed like this ( crossing his middle and index fingers ) and say : " Satan , make me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CYPRIAN ( touching the wound ) . Satan , make me whole again . He takes the bandage off , as the others , grinning slyly , watch him . No trace of the wound remains . Though puzzled and disturbed , he smiles. @x The same room , three months later . The furnishings are mostly the same as before ; the full weeding-out projected by Janet has never been carried through , but some of the shelves have been cleared of their miscellaneous objects and are now filled with Cyprian 's pharmacy : neat rows of bottles and boxes . The lunch tray with Claude 's covered head is still on the smaller table . It is a mild morning early in April , and the left-hand half of the double door has been left partly open , but a coldness in the stage lighting suggests an atmosphere of damnation . Slingo , Stingo and Bongo are clustered about the desk  --  Bongo sitting on the end nearest the audience while the other two stand on either side , Slingo on his right , Stingo on his left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The three little devils should never be so comic as to cease to seem disagreeable . Slingo talks tough ; Bongo is more refined ; Stingo is intensely malignant in a more rudimentary way . SLINGO , STINGO AND BONGO Boola-boola **44;2608;TOOLONG **27;2654;TOOLONG BOO ! Boola BLAH ! Boola BAH ! The last boo is a discordant yell . SLINGO Now , Prezz-bo Brox talked hard as rocks , But he had one tender passion:He loved the Gorgon Glamorpuss  --  He loved her in his fashion . p. 92 ALL Yes , he loved her in his fashion ! SLINGO Now , Glamorpuss is n't good for us  --  She 's no biscuit tortoni  --  A single buss from GlamorpussCan turn poor devils stony . ALL With a htototot and a htatatatAnd a hkkamkka jkkamkka joney ! A single buss from GlamorpussCan turn poor devils stony . STINGO Said Prezz-bo Brox to Curlylocks , " I 'll take you on , my siren ! My heart 's cuirass is a triple brass , And my nerves are made of iron . " ALL Yes , his nerves were made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clasp of steel , Though your snakes be squirmy-slimy.You may stare and stare with your Gorgon glare , But you 'll fail to petrify me . " ALL With a htototot and a htatatatAnd a hkkamkka jkkamkka jymie ! " You may stare and stare with your Gorgon glare , But you 'll fail to petrify me. " p. 93 BONGO ( speaks instead of singing , with portentous and ghoulish ferocity ) So face to face in a locked embrace , He crushed his lovely Gorgon , Till his mind grew dazed and his eyes grew glazed:She 'd paralyzed every organ ! ALL ( singing ) Yes , she 'd paralyzed every organ ! BONGO Now Prezz-bo Brox is immune to shocks:He 's had his load of glamor ! Yes , Prezzo-Brox is hard as rocks  --  You can ring him with a hammer ! ( singing the last line ) Bongo illustrates this by hitting Stingo on the head with his mallet . Stingo reels for a moment , then turns quickly and jabs him with his skewer . Bongo jumps down , and they fight , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( squealing ) . You dirty little backhanded bopper ! BONGO Mad as a hornet , eh ? SLINGO Hey , guys : break it up ! You know what Uncle Luigi says . Do n't scratch each udder 's eyes out : save it for de common enemy ! ( He shoots at them with his sling , and they go after him and chase him around the table . ) Hey , look out : dere 's somebody comin ' ! ( They look toward the waiting-room door . ) Get back into de act ! p. 94 ALL ( resuming the song ) With a htototot and a htatatatAnd a hkkamkka jkkamkka jammer ! Yes , Prezzo-bo Brox is hard as rocks  --  You can ring him with a hammer ! They parade around the stage in single file , singing Boola-boola as before  --  Slingo first ' Stingo holding his tail and Bongo holding Stingo 's tail . Cyprian , accompanied by Luigi , enters from the waiting-room . Cyprian is wearing his gown and cap ; he is harried , unsmiling and jumpy . BONGO We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , do n't be too long about it . BONGO ( to the same tune as before ) . Oh , what a man was Cyp-ri-an ! He tried to help the Devil.Yes , Cyp-ri-an spoke man to man  --  He was always on the level . ALL He was always on the level ! BONGO He said , " I 'll bust or be bad and just  --  Especially the latter . " But he lost his broad , and we brought him ClaudeWith parsley on a platter . ALL With a htototot and a htatatat  --   --  p. 95 LUIGI ( laughing indulgently ) . That 's enough , you rascals ! Scram ! SLINGO We got some more , Uncle Luigi ! CYPRIAN ( morosely , to Luigi ) . Get those devils out of here . LUIGI ( to the Little Devils ) . Never mind any more . Skedaddle ! SLINGO Okiedoke , Uncle Luigi . Slingo darts into the fireplace , Stingo behind the tapestry , and Bongo out behind the closed right-hand half of the double door . Bongo , on his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head . CLAUDE 'S HEAD This may mean the damnation of all of us ! This may mean the damnation of all of us ! This may mean , etc . Cyprian , surprised at this new refrain , looks at the head a moment , then puts the cover back , as if he were performing mechanically an action that had become habitual . CYPRIAN Claude 's got a new tune . LUIGI Even more of a bore than the other . What a pity you could n't have chosen a more entertaining victim ! CYPRIAN What he 's saying is rather against your interests , is n't it ? p. 96 LUIGI Oh , he 's not merely our puppet , you know . He 's still alive and can say his say .  --  But do n't worry about our interests  --  they take care of themselves ! They settle down at the desk , Cyprian behind it , Luigi at the upstage end . CYPRIAN Before we proceed to business , I want you to answer a question , Luigi , that you 've always hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth about the Philosopher 's Stone ? Is it or is it not possible to make gold out of the baser metals ? LUIGI What need have you , sir , for the Philosopher 's Stone when you can have gold from us for the asking ? CYPRIAN In the first place , it 's not in our contract . LUIGI It would be easy to arrange a new one . CYPRIAN In the second place , I do n't want gold . LUIGI Do you not make a mistake to disdain it , when it could bring you so many things ? I wonder that you do n't care to travel . The Little Devils , at this hint of temptation , look out from their hiding-places . CYPRIAN The only thing I care about at present is learning the magician 's trade . LUIGI But frankly , my dear young sir , you labor under a great disadvantage : you know nothing as yet of the world . And you 're not getting your money 's worth : your time is half up today , and you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you could profit by : the refinements and the gaieties of court-life , the freedom of the great ducal libraries  --  and the women  --  you know nothing of women  --  if you could see our Italian beauties ! ( He kisses his hand to the air . ) Their flesh as gamy as pheasant ! Their flashing illicit glances ! ( Cyprian gives him a sour look . ) All this you could have for gold  --  given your looks and distinction  --  and you could always fill your purse by a prayer . p. 97 THE LITTLE DEVILS ( popping out ) . Moola-moola moola-moola !  --   --  LUIGI Hush up , you little wretches ! They hide again . CYPRIAN ( irritably ) . Those imps are getting more and more out of hand . If the customers get a glimpse of them , it will be the end of our business . LUIGI Do n't worry about that , my lord : the wrong people never see them . And do n't let their nonsense annoy you : I was serious in what I was saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxuries . I do n't want to mix with the rich . I came here to learn how to compete with them on an entirely different ground . And you people have n't taught me a single thing about anything I want to know . LUIGI Please tell me what you 'd like to learn . CYPRIAN Oh , I 've told you a dozen times ! ( Getting up to expostulate ) I want to know the principles of Nature . I 've only begun since I 've been here to see what the problems are . I 've been trying , for example , as you know , to find out about the human body . How does our blood heat us ? How do we fuel ourselves with food ? What contrivances do we carry in our heads to solve problems and perform calculations ? Of what does the soul consist and where does it have its lodging ? p. 98 LUIGI I 've provided the dead bodies you asked for and kept them from going to pieces . CYPRIAN But otherwise , you 're not of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anatomy , and you do n't seem to have any way of finding out . The truth is that you agents of Satan are just as limited in your way as the priests . You sit at my elbow prescribing spells that will guide people to find lost objects  --  which are usually much better lost  --  to know things that are happening at a distance or that have n't happened yet  --  and that only make trouble when they 're known  --  or to help some young girl attract a man or some old man to get a girl  --  though , as soon as the spell wears off , they 're in a worse situation than ever . The cures that we do are illusions  --   --  LUIGI You ought not to blame us if you limit yourself to these trivia . I 've told you you were far too cautious . CYPRIAN I have n't the slightest interest in performing mischievous tricks  --  and I 've found out that the greater the magic , the more mischief it 's likely to cause . LUIGI You take a conventional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're completely conventional , with the conventions turned upside down . You people do n't have any real moral courage . You have n't a spark of intellectual audacity . Satan , so far as I can see , knows nothing about philosophy whatever ! He may be cunning the same way that you 're cunning , but , if you represent his deficiencies , he 's a Philistine and an ignoramus ! p. 99 LUIGI I ca n't hear my master insulted  --  and by one who is scarcely a novice . You must n't expect too much ( smiling ) for six months of light damnation . CYPRIAN You mean that I could learn something more if I took on a heavier commitment ? LUIGI Of course  --  and though it 's against my own interests  --  in such matters I 've always been candid  --  in Italy it earned me some credit as a detached and reliable advisor  --  I should say that you ought n't to hesitate to enter into a longer contract . You have a stubborn independence of character which , in centuries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen equalled . A weaker or more frivolous man of such  --  let me say , unprivileged origin , would have been wallowing in self-indulgence . Janet appears in the waiting-room door . Her manner and appearance have somewhat changed : she seems hard and a little vulgar , and her costume is a little flashy . JANET Are n't you ready to begin seeing people ? It 's almost ten o'clock . She produces a small box of rouge from the pocket of her apron , and , holding up her mirror , applies it to her cheeks . CYPRIAN ( with acid sarcasm ) . There must be somebody you find attractive ! p. 100 JANET Do you know what I see in this mirror ? A moonlight night in the woods , with a boy who 's escaped from the priests falling into the arms of the puffballs . Cyprian gives her a sulky glance ; Luigi discreetly smiles . CYPRIAN Who 's first ? JANET The steward from the castle . Not a bad-looking man , if it was n't for his scars from King 's Evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone in the waiting-room ) . You can go in . She returns to the waiting-room . A man of about forty enters  --  his neck is disfigured by scrofula . Cyprian gets up from the desk and comes forward to examine him . CYPRIAN Sit down there . The Steward sits down in the visitors ' chair . Cyprian looks at his scars . CYPRIAN How long have you had these ? THE STEWARD Since childhood , Master . CYPRIAN Have you ever had anything done about it ? THE STEWARD No , Master . I 'd always heard that only the King could cure it , but my liege lord says you can cure it . He gave me this letter to show you . Cyprian takes the letter and puts it on the table behind him without looking at it . p. 101 CYPRIAN You 're lucky to have a master who worries about your welfare . ( Feeling the glands in his neck ) Does that feel sore where it 's swollen ? THE STEWARD Yes , Master . CYPRIAN Open your shirt . The Steward opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a round box . LUIGI Do n't you want the mirror ? He picks up a mirror , breathes on it and makes a quick pass with his left hand . Cyprian , returning from the shelves , reaches out his hand and takes it , without looking at Luigi . CYPRIAN ( listening at the Steward 's chest ) . Now breathe deeply .  --  All right . ( Making a gesture for him to fasten his shirt and putting his hand on the man 's abdomen ) Soreness in the bowels ? THE STEWARD Yes , Master . Cyprian touches the scars , makes a pass and hands the man the mirror . THE STEWARD ( in amazement , as he looks in the mirror ) . It 's gone ! CYPRIAN ( giving the Steward the box ) . Take this in hot wine every night just before you go to bed  --  and come back to see me in a month . p. 102 THE STEWARD ( looking in the mirror again ) . The first time I 've ever looked like other men ! Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't last  --  so do n't forget to take the powder . THE STEWARD My lord bids me tell you he is suffering from another attack of gout . He bids me say he is in horrible pain . Luigi , who has been watching the interview , now picks up the letter and reads it . CYPRIAN Tell my lord I much regret to hear of it  --  that I say he should follow the same regime  --  cut down on wine and red meat and rub his feet with some more of this salve . ( He gives the Steward another box . ) THE STEWARD Yes , Master . Could you not come to the castle and touch it ? CYPRIAN My touch is powerless against the gout . He nods : the man bows and goes out . CYPRIAN ( to Luigi ) . The trouble is you ca n't make them diet . LUIGI You did n't take account of this letter . ( He reads . ) " This steward of mine is a bad number . He robs me , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you for treatment for the King 's Evil , but please give him something to finish him off  --  if possible , without too much howling . " As you were saying , the man 's very fortunate to be bound to so kind a master . ( Getting up ) I 'll bring him back . p. 103 CYPRIAN Sit down : let him go . I 'm not my lord 's executioner  --  and I 'm interested in these cases . This makes three I 've got under treatment . LUIGI You ca n't afford to displease our patron . CYPRIAN I 'll see him and make it all right . I 've always found him perfectly reasonable . Janet appears at the door . JANET There 's a man here who says he 's your brother . CYPRIAN ( in surprise ) . My brother ? JANET Your brother Cyrus . CYPRIAN Well  --  ( Hesitating ) All right : have him come in . Janet turns back to the waiting-room . CYPRIAN You can go now , Luigi . LUIGI Do n't you think it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants to ask for something . CYPRIAN You heard what I said : now go . LUIGI I must remind you that breaches of courtesy are sometimes repaid in kind . With your brother coming to see you , you ought to appear at your best , and you do n't want your interview spoiled by interruptions from these impudent children . The Little Devils stick out their heads . Cyprian gives Luigi a hostile look . Cyrus appears at the door , dressed better than in Act I and with riding-boots. p. 104 CYPRIAN Well , Cyrus : what brings you here ? CYRUS I 'm happy to see you , brother . A very fine place you 've got ! Cyprian comes out from behind the desk ; they exchange salutatory kisses . Luigi also rises , with a demeanor of extreme deference . CYRUS ( admiring his brother 's costume ) . A full-fledged magician , eh ? CYPRIAN Not quite . ( Nodding towards Luigi ) This is Luigi , my major-domo  --  and confidential assistant . Cyrus and Luigi bow . Cyprian gestures toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They all sit . CYPRIAN I 'm surprised that you should venture here . CYRUS Many things have changed since you saw me last . CYPRIAN You 've evidently prospered . CYRUS ( rather smug ) . I have n't done so badly , Cyprian . CYPRIAN What 's happened ? Has the Baron taken you up ? CYRUS No , Cyprian : he 's let me down . I 'm sorry to say you were right about him : I 'll have to admit it now . CYPRIAN ( a little ironical ) . What 's brought you to that conviction ? p. 105 CYRUS I do n't want to dwell on the subject  --  but I was married a month ago  --   --  CYPRIAN And your wife went up to the castle for the privilege of the first night . CYRUS It was a little too much to bear . CYPRIAN How did Mother feel about it ? CYRUS I think she was deeply hurt  --  though she did her best to take it as a matter of course . Of course , I could hardly do that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father ? CYRUS He 's all right . He sent you his love  --  he told me to tell you he was proud of you . Everybody 's been favorably impressed by the way you 've been getting ahead . CYPRIAN I have n't really got very far . CYRUS But you 've taken Merlin 's place ? You 're master of the castle here ? CYPRIAN Merlin 's daughter is the owner of the castle . I 'm merely the acting magician . CYRUS The whole thing , I understand , is on a thoroughly reputable basis . CYPRIAN We 're protected by our local lord .  --  Now tell me what brings you here . You came on a horse like a gentleman ? p. 106 CYRUS I think I may say that my horse is one of which no gentleman would be ashamed . CYPRIAN Whom do you work for now ? CYRUS It 's become very plain to me , Cyprian , that there 's only one side to be on ! CYPRIAN You 're in the King 's service ? CYRUS I am  --  and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a showdown soon between the King and the lords . You know that he 's been cracking down on them ? CYPRIAN Some rumors of it had reached me . CYRUS Did you know that he 'd abolished the right to hunt that used to play such havoc with us ? CYPRIAN ( impressed by this ) . Has he really ? I 'm surprised he should go so far . How does old Rody take it ? CYRUS He blusters , but he keeps to the castle . CYPRIAN What about Charles the Bold ? There 's a vassal who wants to be king himself  --  and who fears neither God nor ( stopping himself as he glances at Luigi )  --  sovereign . CYRUS Charles is a mutinous hothead  --  his projects are quite unsound . His Majesty is shrewd and farseeing and will know how to strike when the time is ripe . But he depends on the burgesses to back him up . p. 107 CYPRIAN Are we burgesses ? CYRUS We 're not simple peasants . CYPRIAN Yes , of course ; in your case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 'd be a title in it for you ? CYRUS It 's not beyond the bounds of the possible . His Majesty has had the grace to ennoble persons of baser birth . CYPRIAN I see . Well , I wish you luck . CYRUS That must wait . In the meantime , my only aim is to serve His Majesty 's cause .  --  And I want you to help me , Cyprian . CYPRIAN What can I do for Louis ? CYRUS You possess certain powers , I understand . CYPRIAN ( shrugging ) . Only to a limited extent . LUIGI ( with a smile , to Cyrus ) . If you will permit me , sir : Master Cyprian is far too modest . CYRUS ( after taking this in , to Cyprian ) . The King , you know , is strong on magic . He keeps an astrologer at court . CYPRIAN Astrology has always bored me : I 'm not sure there 's anything in it . CYRUS That was n't what I had in mind . I 've heard on the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mage of another kind . The inevitable day is coming when Louis must meet Charles in the field . Now , if Charles could be sent adverse weather  --  or a pestilence to weaken his troops  --  or even a fatal stroke in one of his fits of temper !  --  I do n't know what your magic can do ? ( He looks inquiringly toward Luigi. ) p. 108 LUIGI A mage of Master Cyprian 's caliber can command almost infinite powers if the proper conditions are met . CYPRIAN How could I serve the King and keep my liege lord 's protection ? He belongs to the nobles ' league , too . CYRUS That does n't sound like you , Cyprian ! You never liked to owe anything to the nobles . CYPRIAN This one 's a brilliant exception : a patron of the new learning , a humane and enlightened man . LUIGI ( smiling slyly ) . With occasional lapses perhaps . CYPRIAN I 'm perfectly satisfied . CYRUS Take the King for your patron , Cyprian  --  our protector against feudal privilege ! LUIGI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . CYPRIAN I 've got to learn my business first . CYRUS This is the moment , Cyprian : the struggle will soon be decided . CYPRIAN Come back in three months ' time  --  come back when you can tell me exactly in what way I could be useful at court and whether the King would receive me . LUIGI If the crisis arises sooner ? p. 109 CYPRIAN ( getting up ) . It will have to be decided without me . Come back the first week in July . That 's all I can say at the present time .  --  And now I must see my clients . These are my office hours .  --  ( Not urging him very warmly ) You 'll stay with us , wo n't you ? CYRUS I ca n't tonight : I must get on to Abbville on business of vital importance . But I 'd like to lie down for an hour . ( Yawning ) I 've been riding most of the night . CYPRIAN Yes , certainly .  --  ( To Luigi ) Will you please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsequiously ) . Yes , Your Excellency : at once . He goes out into the waiting-room . CYRUS ( looking around ) . You 're living devilish well here , CYPRIAN  --   --  CYPRIAN ( nervously ) . What ?  --  Oh , yes . CYRUS  --  though your furnishings are a bit peculiar . ( Seeing the tray on the table ) A snack always handy , eh ? ( He starts to lift the cover to see what is underneath. ) p. 110 CYPRIAN ( catching him just in time ) . Do n't touch that ! Put it down ! CYRUS ( hastily dropping the cover ) . What is it ? CYPRIAN It 's magic  --  it 's not really a lunch . You must n't fool with things around here . Janet comes in with Luigi . CYPRIAN But you 'll be all right in your room . ( To Janet ) This is my brother Cyrus . ( To Cyrus ) This is Miss Janet , Merlin 's daughter . She is the chtelaine here . ( She curtsies ; Cyrus bows . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down for a nap . Will you have a room made ready ? JANET The room in the north tower is always prepared for guests , if your brother will please to accept it . LUIGI May I have the honor of escorting him ? CYPRIAN I 'll show him the way myself . ( To Janet ) Are there any more people out there ? JANET Only one : Mr. B.  --  our ever-returning petitioner . CYPRIAN Have him come in  --  I 'll be back in a moment . He takes Cyrus out through the double doors . The latter bows deeply to Janet . p. 111 JANET You can go , Luigi . LUIGI This brother was sent by our people . It carries out part of the pact , you know , and it 's time that we got him hooked . He 's getting bored with his conjuring-tricks . JANET ( walking to the waiting-room door ) . I know all about that . You can go . He withdraws through the double doors . JANET ( at the waiting-room door ) . Come in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows , the Little Devils look out of their hiding-places , astonished to see Mr. B. and at first very much in awe of him . JANET And how is your good wife ? He turns away . JANET Not dead already ? MR . B Yes . JANET What a pity when you wanted so to love her ! So she never got the love , and you have lost your idol . MR . B I am greatly to blame  --  I should never have tried . JANET We must practise humility now ! MR . B With her I was always humble . How else could I have given up my throne and gone with her to live in the forest ? p. 112 JANET You humble ! You playing the penitent ! The most arrogant devil in Hell ! You thought that it was n't enough to challenge the Powers Above : even when you 'd been damned to eternity , you dared to rebel against Hell  --  to pretend to the honors of sainthood !  --  and now that you have n't succeeded , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of delight . MR . B Beware of moral scorn , Miss Janet : it does n't hurt me , but it 's harmful to you . It 's an emotion we used to encourage . JANET ( laughing ) . Harmful for me , is it ? Miss Janet thanks Mr. B. !  --  He 's too thoughtful for that darling Miss Janet who was always so nice to his wife  --  but then , there 's another Miss Janet who rejoices to hear of her death ! MR . B Oh , it 's you ! ( He takes her by the shoulders and looks into her eyes intently . ) I thought there was something wrong ! How did you get in here , Jezebel ? JANET That young pedant did nothing to prevent it . He actually left the door half-open . MR . B This is rather small time for you ! JANET I picked the assignment on purpose . I wanted to enjoy your fiasco . p. 113 MR . B So I 've earned the vengeance of Hell as well as the vengeance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm ready to stand up to both ! JANET You presumptuous twice-damned fool ! What will you try to do now ? You can hardly go home again : you wo n't find them very cordial . MR . B When was Hell ever cordial ? The Little Devils , emboldened now , come out and begin to jeer at him in their native diabolic language . BONGO Mkka-nnya onya ggna-westa ! STINGO Mkka-nnyi gnzi glesta-glesta ! SLINGO Gnza wddi-wddi skmba-nmbil ALL ( pointing and prolonging the vowels in a final intensive insult ) . **28;2683;TOOLONG ! ( They break into derisive laughter . ) JANET ( to Mr. B. ) . Why do n't you make them be quiet ? The Little Devils stop laughing . MR . B I 've given up my authority now  --  I 'm not going back to Hell . p. 114 JANET Turning the other cheek ! I thought you had guts at least ! The Little Devils , thus encouraged , begin to snicker again . Slingo slaps Stingo on the cheek , and Stingo turns the other cheek , meekly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm , joining his hands in a pose of prayer . Bongo raises his mallet to hit Stingo on the head , but Stingo sees this and dodges away and falls upon Bongo with his skewer . Slingo seizes Stingo by the tail in order to pull him off . JANET ( to the Little Devils ) . **31;2713;TOOLONG ! They cease fighting and scamper to their places , from which , however , they continue to peer . Mr. B. goes over to the waiting-room door and looks out as if to check on something . JANET ( to Mr. B. ) . You 've got to expect this . But do n't think that I 'm going to jeer at you . MR . B ( ironic ) . Kind of you , Jezebel ! JANET I 've already had my revenge  --  and you really ca n't blame me , can you ? After centuries we 'd spent together ! MR . B Who am I to blame you ? The Little Devils shriek with laughter at this . p. 115 JANET ( nodding toward the waiting-room door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MR . B Yes . JANET A problem for you , I can see . What will you do with her now ? MR . B That 's no concern of yours . Bongo darts over behind the desk and whispers to Slingo and Stingo . They eagerly fall in with his suggestion , and all , without Mr. B. 's seeing them , creep across the back of the stage and out into the waiting-room . Cyprian comes in from the porch . CYPRIAN ( to Mr. B. ) . I 'm sorry to keep you waiting , but my brother has just arrived . How have things been going with you ? MR . B My wife is dead . CYPRIAN ( after a moment 's shocked silence , with sincerity ) . I 'm sorry  --  I 'm terribly sorry . ( To Janet ) You did n't tell me how ill she was . JANET I was n't able to get to see her . CYPRIAN ( to Mr. B. ) . If you 'd only come back to see me ! I had something that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped . It was sent by Him . But I want to ask you one favor . p. 116 CYPRIAN Yes , of course : what is it ? MR . B Well , you know the new priest here : he 's a fool , an insane fanatic . He would n't let her be buried in the churchyard  --  which , after all , is understandable  --  but when I made her a grave in the forest , he preached to the village people that they ought to go out and dig her up and drive a stake through her body . He told them she was a vampire and would rise from the grave . CYPRIAN I 'm not sure that she 'd be safe here . You know that we  --   --  MR . B I know about that . CYPRIAN But still , if she died a Christian , I doubt whether they could harm her . MR . B She tried to , but I ca n't be sure . The priest , of course , would n't come near her  --  and she refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was completely irregular  --  though I did my best to persuade her . CYPRIAN Wo n't somebody intercede ? MR . B ( ruefully shrugging his shoulders and nodding toward the heavens ) . You 'd imagine that Somebody would if Their principles are what They pretend . CYPRIAN ( to Janet ) . Could we put her in the family vault ? p. 117 JANET There 's no room . It was full up when Father died . CYPRIAN There 's still room between the niches . The devils would n't dare disturb her  --  ( to Mr. B. ) Where is she ? MR . B I brought her  --  in a kind of coffin . I did n't want to leave her in the forest . CYPRIAN You brought it to the castle here ? JANET ( nodding toward the door on the left ) . He left it in the waiting-room . A delightful surprise for our clients ! MR . B It looks like a travelling chest . Nobody would know it 's a coffin . Cyrus comes in through the double doors in a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and listen with evident glee . Luigi discreetly follows . CYRUS ( to Cyprian ) . I do n't know whether you know it , Cyprian , but that bed 's got a dead woman in it . CYPRIAN What , the bed in your bedroom ? CYRUS Yes . CYPRIAN It was all right when I was there . I made a point of looking through the curtains . CYRUS It may have happened after you left . I was out of the room for a while . A little black page appeared and said he 'd been sent by you to show me the grounds . Cyprian glances toward the Little Devils , who quickly pull in their heads . p. 118 CYPRIAN You 're sure it was not a dummy or a mere empty simulacrum ? CYRUS I 'd say it was perfectly real and that it needed immediate attention . She was pretty far gone around the mouth . MR . B ( to Cyprian ) . Take me to the room , please . Cyrus , looking around at Mr. B. and taking in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( moving toward the door , to Cyrus ) . I 'm sorry about it , Cy . We 've had some mischievous spirits here  --  though our friend Mr. B. is n't one of them . JANET I doubt whether Cyprian would notice whether a bed had a woman in it  --  or whether she were alive or not ! Cyprian goes out to the porch , followed by Mr. B. LUIGI ( coming forward , to Janet ) . Those young ruffians will have to be dealt with . One would think it was Halloween ! ( To the Little Devils ) Away with you !  --  I 'll make you say the Lord 's Prayer backwards five hundred and fifty-nine times . They retreat through the double door . LUIGI ( to Cyrus ) . Can we hope that you will pardon us , sir ? You will have a poor opinion , I fear , of the hospitality of the castle . How a person of your gentle birth must have shuddered at this disgusting incident ! p. 119 CYRUS I can not claim gentle birth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all  --  if you will pardon my saying so  --  unmistakably proclaim noble blood .  --  We must trust to your knowledge of the world , if not to condone , then at least to comprehend , that  --  distasteful though we always find it  --  we are sometimes compelled to resort to rather unsavory agents . Even His Majesty must sometimes do that ! CYRUS His Majesty 's agents are all loyal subjects . LUIGI ( with a deprecatory laugh ) . Well , I ca n't say so much for our own . But what we aim at is to get results , and we can not afford petty scruples.  --  I was fascinated by your subtle ideas for demolishing Charles the Bold . To the modern magician , such projects present an exciting challenge . CYRUS Could it be done ? LUIGI There 's no doubt that it could be done , but the cost would be rather high . CYRUS His Majesty can meet any cost . LUIGI It would be necessary for Master Cyprian  --  or for somebody empowered to act for him  --  to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to secure such an audience . p. 120 LUIGI It ought , of course , to be done at once . CYRUS That 's just what I was trying to tell him ! Cyprian and Mr. B. return through the double doors , Mr. B. is carrying a long chest , which he sets down just inside the room ; he stands in front of it with folded arms . CYPRIAN ( to Cyrus ) . Do n't think me inhospitable , Cyrus , but perhaps it is just as well for you not to try to stay here at present . CYRUS Do n't say a word , old boy ! I appreciate the situation perfectly . It 's a ticklish business , I know  --  but the big results are what count , eh ? CYPRIAN ( taking Cyrus by the arm ) . I 'll go down and have your horse brought round . CYRUS Your counsellor here has suggested that , if anything is going to be done in the way of approaching the King , it ought to be done at once . LUIGI ( to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if you wait till our agreement ends , you may no longer have the power to act . Cyprian , impressed by this stands silent a moment , thinking . CYPRIAN ( to Cyrus ) . Come in on your way back from Abbville. p. 121 LUIGI ( to Cyprian ) . I should be happy to represent you , if you feel , sir , that you can not leave the castle . CYPRIAN If anything 's to be done , I 'll do it myself . LUIGI ( smiling to himself ) . Very good , sir . CYRUS It 's a chance of a lifetime , Cyprian ! It 's the biggest thing since the Crusades ! If Louis falls , then France is lost , and that would sound the knell of Christendom . The Sultan 's at the gates of Venice , and Venice is the gate to Europe ! CYPRIAN I congratulate you , Cyrus . CYRUS You may , indeed ! Am I not defending our Holy Faith  --  the Cross against the heathen Crescent ! Luigi , at the mention of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . CYPRIAN I meant , on having found a new source for eloquent readymade phrases .  --  But come in on your way back . CYRUS Right you are , Cyprian . And now I 'll be off . ( Kissing Janet 's hand ) At your service , my lady . ( Bowing low to Luigi ) Your servant , sir . CYPRIAN ( turning to Janet ) . Will you get me the key to the vault ? He steers Cyrus toward the waiting-room door . Luigi follows . p. 122 JANET I do n't know where it is  --  I 've mislaid it . LUIGI ( speaking to Cyprian just as Cyrus goes out ) . You know this is just what you asked for : a chance to get back at the Baron . CYPRIAN ( on his way out ) . You do n't need to tell me , Luigi . He goes out , and Luigi follows . MR . B ( stepping forward as Cyrus leaves the room ) . Give me the key : you 've got it there . JANET ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . I 'll give it to you on one condition . MR . B I do n't accept any conditions . JANET In that case , you can no longer command me . MR . B ( moving toward the chest , as if to pick it up ) . Quite true : well , do as you please . JANET ( holding out the key ) . Bury your saint if you like but then come back to me . MR . B I 've told you , I 'm done with all that . I 'm sick of the traffic in souls . It can no longer nourish my pride . p. 123 JANET It did in those days in Provence when you and I were working together . You were brilliant when you talked over the Albigensians and got them all burned as heretics ! What a great lark that was ! Not only were the heretics damned but we pulled in the monks as well . How we laughed when those Inquisitors were dying and thought they were going to their just reward , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MR . B Yes : that was a dirty business ! The best of those heretics were holy men . It was they who should have gone to Heaven . He leaves it to the churchmen to decide about doctrine and then damns them for their sins of ambition and spite . JANET Well , you see what you get by criticizing . You were once the most envied of all the devils  --  the most dashing figure in Hell . They talked about your exploits in Heaven . And what are you now ? Nothing : a laughing-stock to Hell and Heaven both ! MR . B I carried such exploits as far as they could go . Doing evil is a blind alley . JANET Did you know that the King was available ?  --  Louis , their French King ? That brother who was here has a plan to reach him . He 's crafty and deceitful , Louis . They say that he 's pious and superstitious , but with the superstitious kind of piety , it 's never hard to turn it the other way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  I do n't even want to know him . JANET What a lofty moral tone for a devil as black as Sin ! MR . B I can make my own choice of evils . JANET Oh , can you ? You tried to repudiate your people , and what happened ?  --  you sent your ugly mistress to Hell  --   --  MR . B Is she there ? JANET Of course she 's there . Did n't she give herself to you ?  --  And you 're stuck with her nasty remains , going around begging favors of mortals , with no home and no occupation . It 's an impasse : you 'll have to go back . MR . B I want neither Heaven nor Hell . JANET Why do n't you fly to Arabia and bury your darling there in the earth of the unbelievers ? MR . B I wo n't use diabolic powers  --  it would make me a devil again . I want to rejoin mankind . JANET But why ? MR . B There 's the germ of some new power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JANET I ca n't imagine what you mean ; but in any case you never can join them . p. 125 MR . B After all , their Savior , His son , did . JANET Oh , so that 's it !  --  I had n't guessed . You want to compete with Him ! You ca n't rest till you 're crucified ! MR . B ( smiling ) . I know who would drive the first nail . JANET Oh , oh , that 's too much ! Old Crucified ! Old Hornless carrying a coffin !  --  Well , you ca n't leave your coffin here . Even our little imps can knock it around , you see ! MR . B The bodies of mighty magicians lie under a spell in that vault . Your hoodlums wo n't dare go near it . JANET I 'll tell you what I 'll do then , and this you wo n't like ! That young idiot is crazy for corpses  --  he cuts them up for his medical studies , and I 'll give him your late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under my influence that he has n't even noticed yet that Jezebel is n't Janet , and the slightest suggestion from me would soon have him hauling out that cadaver and scrouging at her liver and lights . MR . B ( suddenly furious ) . Be still ! I command you  --  begone ! He seizes Janet by the upper arms and bends over her with fierce eyes , while she tries to avoid his gaze , threshing from side to side . p. 126 MR . B Look at me , you miserable succuba ! I make myself your master again . Get out of this good girl 's body and let her return to herself ! ( She convulsively strains her head away , but he grasps it and holds it before him . ) Your master commands you : go ! He slaps her on either cheek , and she utters a hateful cry that prolongs itself and sinks to a moan , as he drops her into a chair to the left of the double doors , her eyes staring fixedly and her body held rigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands over her , ferocious ; then , glaring , looks away at the coffin ; then becomes aghast at himself . MR . B That 's bad : the first time I 've relapsed ! I must curb it : I might have been cruel ( looking at Janet in the chair )  --  I might have spat on the coffin or kicked it ( turning away toward the chest )  --  I might have flamed up and flown back to Hell . But no : I can hold , still , ( He carefully picks up the coffin and balances it on his shoulder . ) Neither Satan nor the Other shall judge me , for I can judge myself . I will keep my oath to myself though I carry this coffin forever ! He goes out through the double door . JANET ( gasping in her own voice , like a sleeper crying out from a nightmare ) . Cyprian  --  oh , Cyprian , help me ! Cyprian comes in from the waiting-room , does not notice Janet at first and looks around for Mr. B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to the double doors and out on the stone porch . p. 127 CYPRIAN Mr. B. !  --  oh , Mr. B. ! ( He returns , sees Janet , but goes on to the desk , hardly glancing at her , and , busying himself with papers , speaks to her with casual coldness . ) Did you drive him away ? What did you do ?  --  pretend you could n't find the key ?  --  I do n't understand you , Janet . You used to be so considerate , and now you seem so hard . You 're as cutting and cold as your father was .  --  I thought at first that , no matter what happened , I 'd always have a supporter in you  --  and now I do n't feel that you 're with me at all . There 's nobody I can count on  --  not a soul ! The worst of it is that I 'm not even sure that any of us has got a soul . JANET This is my soul , Cyprian ! CYPRIAN What ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to her and stands before her . ) Are you ill ? What 's the matter ? JANET ( gasping ) . I ca n't wake up  --   --  from the nightmare . I 've been  --  asleep  --  too long . CYPRIAN ( shaking her ) . Your eyes are open . Wake up !  --  JANET I ca n't  --  get control  --  of my body . CYPRIAN What 's happened ? Come : try to move ! p. 128 JANET You  --  banished me . You thrust me  --  away . CYPRIAN I 'm here with you now . JANET Are you ? CYPRIAN Yes , of course .  --  You sound like your old self again ! JANET ( speaking somewhat more easily , her face becoming responsive and her hands making freer gestures , though she still remains stiffly seated ) . An alien spirit was in me . CYPRIAN What spirit ? JANET That woman I told you about . CYPRIAN They bewitched you ! JANET I 'm not free yet .  --  Why did you have them do it ? CYPRIAN I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CYPRIAN But not to dislike you . JANET It has to be one or the other . CYPRIAN Not always . JANET If people want one another . CYPRIAN I did n't know what would happen . JANET Try to break the spell . p. 129 CYPRIAN How can I ? I 've signed a pact , and it 's still got three months to run . JANET They 're trying to make you sign another . CYPRIAN ( realizing the situation ) . So they are ! They were almost succeeding ! What 's happened to me ? I 've not been myself . JANET Try to fight them with some other kind of magic . CYPRIAN But what ? JANET Try the genie in the bottle . CYPRIAN Could a genie destroy the pact ? JANET It 's supposed to be the strongest thing . CYPRIAN All right  --  by God ! I 'll try it ! JANET Better hurry ! I do n't want them to take me back . In the storeroom : the closet on the left . CYPRIAN I know where it is ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of herself and succeeds , holding on to the arms , in partly getting up from the chair . Luigi hurries in through the double doors , followed by the Little Devils . LUIGI ( to Janet ) . Jezebel ! What 's this ? are you here ? Janet does not answer . p. 130 LUIGI That renegade has sent her away ! ( Looking around the room ) Jezebel , are you here ? JANET Keep away : I do n't want you near me ! Luigi comes around to face Janet and makes rapid signs in the air . She sinks back into the chair , stiffening and staring again . LUIGI ( hypnotic and soothing ) . Abtha amtha-nthas . ( Peremptorily and sharply ) Jezebel , amkkin-tkkyulak knthas ! The Little Devils cluster around to see what is going to happen . JANET Go away , go away ! I hate you ! Luigi signals to Stingo , who leaps upon Janet 's lap and holds his skewer against her heart . LUIGI ( almost shrieking with vehemence ) . Yield !  --  you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your heart ? In a moment it will pierce you through . Satan is not mocked ! JANET Kill me and free my spirit ! LUIGI Knthsa bemblso-bssa ! amssa strmpstharso , Jezebel ! ( Stressing the syllable strumpsth ) Now , yield to her ! Janet is shaken as if by a sudden jolt and sits forward , pushing Stingo off her lap . Cyprian comes back through the double doors , carrying a round copper bottle . Seeing Luigi and the Little Devils clustered around Janet , he rushes over and , taking Luigi by the arm , violently flings him aside . p. 131 CYPRIAN Get away from her , you filthy fiend ! LUIGI ( seeing the bottle and pointing at it ) . What 's that ? CYPRIAN We 're soon going to see ! LUIGI ( servile again ) . Oh , I beg you , sir , do n't open that bottle ! It 's dangerous to mix two magics ! CYPRIAN Dangerous to you , perhaps . LUIGI But the game we play has certain rules  --  both sides must abide by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them ! CYPRIAN I never promised not to summon new forces . And , frankly , I 'm bored with you , Luigi  --  I do n't fall for your banal temptations , and I 'm sick of the confusion here : personalities going to pieces , dead people in the beds ! Even my work is all mixed up with charlatanry , and I 'm not making any progress ! LUIGI You have only three more months of your bargain . CYPRIAN Here 's something that will help me get through them . ( He holds the bottle up and reads an inscription on it . ) " Giant oriental genie : impervious to Western magic ; capable of immense labors . Does everything on a colossal scale , so be careful not to ask too much . " The Little Devils slink out through the double doors . Janet is now possessed again by Jezebel , and starts up from the chair with a shriek . p. 132 JANET A genie ? Oh , no ! She rushes out through the waiting-room . LUIGI You do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up this whole castle , just the way an eagle does a tortoise , and smash it on the earth below ! CYPRIAN ( goes on reading ) . " Be sure to make bargain with genie before letting him out of bottle . " LUIGI My good sir , you wo n't be able to control him ! It takes a wizard of exceptional powers . CYPRIAN ( still reading ) . " Real name is "  --  I ca n't pronounce it  --  " but he answers to the name of Buster "  --   --  BUSTER ( in a high thin voice ) . There is no God but Allah , and Mohammed is his prophet ! CYPRIAN ( to the Genie ) . Will you do what I ask if I let you out ? BUSTER I swear it by the beard of the Prophet ! Cyprian takes out a knife and begins to scrape away the wax with which the stopper is sealed . LUIGI ( in desperation ) . Do you realize that this genie is a Mohammedan ? Do you want to let Islam in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he holds the bottle against his thigh ) . Better Mohammed than Satan ! Luigi gasps for a moment as if to start a new remonstrance , then swiftly glides out through the double doors . The stopper comes out with a loud report . Darkness : a hissing sound , as if of steam escaping . Then the Genie is seen in a spotlight , towering in the center of the stage and facing toward Cyprian at stage left . He has oriental eyes , swarthy skin , hair that stands straight up on his head and a mustache that resembles Stalin 's . He is dressed in oriental costume . BUSTER ( in a guttural voice ) @x The study , three months later : the night of the last day of June . The double doors are open on darkness and a sky where a few stars appear . The magician 's robe and cap are back on their peg in the corner . Buster is sitting behind the desk , leaning back in his chair , with his left foot up on the desk-top . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment of recreation . The skeleton has been hung from the shelves to the right of the tray with Claude 's head , and Bongo is playing on its ribs with his hammer , as if it were a xylophone . His back is presented to the audience , and he is seen to have lost his tail , of which only a stump is left , with a bandage tied around it . The tune is Au Clair de la Lune . At the end of the last line  --  Pour l'amour de Dieu  --  he strikes a sour note . Buster looks around with a frown . BUSTER What kind of music is that ? BONGO It 's a much-admired melody , Your Radiance  --  but we do n't like the last word , so we give it a touch of dissonance . BUSTER Disgusting European stuff ! The art of the West is putrescent ! Give me something gay from the East . BONGO Yes , Your Radiance . He begins to play some hootchy-kootchy music : Buster sits back and smiles . Stingo comes in briskly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bongo looks around from his xylophone ; Buster with a gesture bids Bongo stop , and he stands at attention with his hammer in both hands . p. 135 BUSTER ( to Stingo ) . Well , what is it ? STINGO ( making a low salaam and presenting a piece of parchment but looking at Buster with hatred ) . Master Cyprian just got this letter . BUSTER ( scanning the letter ) . What 's he doing ? STINGO Just the same thing as usual : mucking around with dead rabbits . BUSTER ( throwing down the letter ) . Tell him to come here at once . STINGO ( salaaming ) . Immediately , Your Radiance . He goes out through the back , and at the same moment Slingo comes running in . He has been flying and has just alighted . He hurriedly salaams . BUSTER You 're late . What 's the reason ? SLINGO I 'm sorry , boss : I could n't make it no faster . BUSTER It ought n't to take you twelve hours to pop down to Constantinople ! SLINGO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boss . BUSTER That 's not the way to address me ! SLINGO Excuse it , please , Commander of the Faithful . p. 136 BUSTER And why ca n't you fly like you used to ? SLINGO It seems like I 'm losing my power , boss  --   --  ( catching himself up ) Bright Shining Sun . It must be those Mohammedan prayers you make us say every day . They kinda take the zingo out of us . BUSTER Be still , you little infidel flea that does n't even know how to hop ! SLINGO Yes  --  Center of the Universe . BUSTER What message did the Sultan give you ? SLINGO He told me to inform Your Radiance that he figures it wo n't be long now . It seems as though Venice was knuckling under . BUSTER What else ? SLINGO Mm . Seems like he did n't say no more . BUSTER He must have said something more . SLINGO Seems like my memory is going , too . BUSTER Was your memory sufficiently retentive to convey to him the message I gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , that the princes of Europe are all at one anudder 's t'roats  --  so deh ca n't carry on no new crusade . BUSTER All right : go and get a rest , and then make another effort to remember what the Sultan said . p. 137 SLINGO Can I skip the prayers tonight , boss ? BUSTER Are my orders to be questioned ? SLINGO No , boss  --  but I can tell you that my old chief in Hell ai n't gonta like it much if he t'inks I 'm disloyal to him . He 's gonta turn off my current , he 's gonta let me fade away . BUSTER What do you mean , " disloyal " ? Mohammed is your only chief ! Say it after me : Allah is the only God . SLINGO Allah is the only God ! BUSTER " And "  --  go on ! " And "  --   --  SLINGO And Mohammed is his prophet . BONGO ( producing a scrap of parchment ) . I wonder whether this might help to explain . I found it in Slingo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUSTER ( taking the slip and reading aloud ) " Oh , Buster Big is a very big pig , But he came from a very small bottle . " ( He gives Slingo a terrible look . ) " He tried to boss the demon force  --  He tried to make them grovel "  --   --  SLINGO I did n't write dat , boss ! I can rhyme better dan dat ! p. 138 BUSTER Ha ! A formalist , eh ? SLINGO ( pointing at Bongo ) . He wrote it  --  he wrote it  --  he wrote it himself ! BONGO Everybody knows that Slingo has been writing all our songs . SLINGO You dirty little squealer ! you write dem ! BUSTER ( to Slingo ) . Do you know what happened to Bongo for running away last night ? ( To Bongo ) Show him your rump , you rat ! Bongo turns around and sticks out his behind , displaying the pathetic stump . Slingo , with an instinctive movement , puts his hand to his tail . Cyprian and Luigi come in by way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his working clothes . BUSTER ( to Luigi ) . Luigi , take this little black ape and clip him like the other one . ( Illustrating with his right hand brought down like a cleaver on to his left palm ) . Chop , chop ! LUIGI ( salaaming ) . Your order shall be executed , Commander of the Faithful . BUSTER He 's a poet , our little Slingo ! Let him write a nice hymn to Buster  --  and Bongo will set it to music ! ( He makes a gesture for them to go . ) Luigi salaams again and leads Bongo and Slingo out by the back , dragging them by the arms . p. 139 CYPRIAN ( to Buster ) . Well , what is it ? It 's got to be important . I told you not to disturb me at night . BUSTER ( holding up the letter ) . No visitors , Master Cyprian ! Your brother must not come here . CYPRIAN You 're spying on my correspondence ! I thought our understanding was that you were to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! BUSTER Has anyone interfered with your work ? CYPRIAN These devils are a damned nuisance ! I ca n't leave my room a minute without having an imp creep in . BUSTER I ordered them to be very quiet . CYPRIAN I do n't want them around at all ! Slingo screams shrilly outside . Cyprian turns with a frown . BUSTER ( with a too friendly smile ) . Security , good Master Cyprian : we have to take proper precautions ! It would n't do to have it known that you 're harboring a Mohammedan here . CYPRIAN We sha n't need precautions now . You 'll be free to go home tomorrow . My agreement with Satan expires at twelve o'clock noon . BUSTER I 'm quite comfortable here , Master Cyprian , and I do n't think you ought to be hasty in dismissing our helpful devils . I 've brought them to heel , as you see . They can profitably serve us both , and my presence here gives you protection . Have I not established order , as you bade me ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . BUSTER But how can you pursue your studies without an Arabian mentor ? Arabia is the mother of medicine  --   --  CYPRIAN Not quite : there were also the Greeks . BUSTER Oh , no , no , no , Master Cyprian ! All the vital discoveries in the healing art were made by the race of the Prophet . Have you read the treatise I gave you ? CYPRIAN I can tell you that the Arabs are out of date . Their use of drugs even is obsolete , and what interests me most  --  anatomy  --  is a subject they 've never touched . BUSTER Anatomy is an unclean study . The Koran forbids us to tamper with corpses . No , your work should be with drugs , Master Cyprian . The countryside is ringing with your marvellous cures  --  all of which you owe to Arab science ! CYPRIAN The fact remains , Buster , that you leave tomorrow . BUSTER I am not at your orders , Master Cyprian  --  you summoned me here in the first place and you can not expel me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know that with one blow of my fist ( he brings it down on the table ) I could smash this little castle to atoms ? p. 141 CYPRIAN I wonder that you have n't snatched Paris and presented it on a platter to the Sultan ! BUSTER That will come , Master Cyprian . The sword of Allah will conquer  --  and in the meantime our interests , yours and mine , are absolutely one and the same . Are we not both the sworn foes of Christendom ? You have spat upon its fraudulent God  --   --  CYPRIAN Not to take on your even more fraudulent one . BUSTER ( roaring ) . Blasphemer !  --  be respectful to Allah or I 'll slit your unbelieving throat ! Get back to your laboratory  --  throw out your disgusting dead bodies and give me prescriptions for the healing of wounds ! In this war we are waging on Europe , we shall need to save horses and men . Janet has appeared from the waiting-room . JANET ( to Buster ) . You 'd better go to Luigi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to send him on to another assignment when his time is up here tomorrow . BUSTER The old reptile ! He told me he was free to stay . ( To Janet ) Do n't you come  --  you keep away ! He hurries out through the doorway at the back . p. 142 CYPRIAN ( to Janet ) . Can a genie get the better of the Devil ? JANET That 's what I want to see . CYPRIAN What I do n't understand is how Buster has been getting all you people to submit to him . JANET The way he gets Luigi to submit to him is by promising the old fool to have him admitted to the Mohammedan paradise . He 's told him that a devil who accepts their faith can blossom into a blessed spirit , and Luigi 's been so long in Italy tempting people to sensual pleasures that he could n't enjoy himself that he fell for ( ironically ) all those fountain-sprayed gardens and beautiful black-eyed houris and non-alcoholic drinks that the faithful are supposed to get . CYPRIAN Have the imps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders from Luigi . CYPRIAN And how about you ? JANET I 'm not working for Buster . There 's nothing in it for me . CYPRIAN Why not ? JANET You know what they think of women ! CYPRIAN Why does Buster want to stay in Europe ? The way he was talking just now , I almost thought he was a Mohammedan agent . p. 143 JANET Of course he 's a Mohammedan agent . He thinks he 's preparing the conquest of Europe . Some sultan shut him up in a bottle a couple of centuries ago for belonging to the wrong sect  --  that 's the worst thing that can happen to a Mohammedan  --  and now he 's working his silly fat head off trying to show how loyal he is . This castle is their headquarters in France now . CYPRIAN I never know when you 're lying . JANET You do n't need to worry in this case . I do n't want Islam to win : it would mean the end of my freedom . CYPRIAN Then why did you tell Buster the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the stronger .  --  Look out now and tell me what they 're doing . Cyprian goes to the doorway and , keeping out of sight , watches . JANET I 'm worrying because Luigi and his imps have been losing their vitality lately . This Mohammedanism is making them impotent . CYPRIAN ( reporting on the scene outside ) . It looks as if Buster was winning . JANET How disgusting ! They 'll want you to sign a new pact . He 'll be constantly needing new devils , because working for him makes them go dead . p. 144 CYPRIAN I 'll tell you they wo n't succeed . JANET They 're in the strong position . CYPRIAN They 've evidently agreed on something . The messenger is going now . JANET I 'll be furious if I have to stay on here bedevilling an untonsured monastic like you ! Oh , for a decent assignment , with a victim one can get one 's teeth into ! Buster and Luigi come in . Janet gives them a look and goes out through the waiting-room . BUSTER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sovereign . I believe we can work together  --  we must have your consent to a new agreement . LUIGI It 's a question of renewing the pact  --  for a couple of years , let us say . CYPRIAN The pact will be over tomorrow ! LUIGI Pray listen to me , Master Cyprian . If you will stay with us a little longer , your position will become supreme . The combination of your medical skill and the prodigies of our magic have already made a great impression . Why should you not continue ? You can become the most brilliant physician in Europe . CYPRIAN I 'm tired of playing the charlatan . p. 145 BUSTER You need not even lack opportunity for your favorite study of anatomy . It is true that the dissection of corpses is implacably forbidden by the Prophet , but we have nothing against vivisection , and in the war that is to burst on Europe , there will be plenty of wounded persons who will be certain to die of their wounds and who might as well serve your science . CYPRIAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUSTER You are very unwise , Master Cyprian . Do n't you know that I can hand you to the hangman ? If your neighbors or even your patron were to be told that you are served here by devils as foul as the midden of Hell , your life would not be worth a fig . CYPRIAN The devils will be gone tomorrow . BUSTER The alarm will be given tonight . CYPRIAN By whom ? They ca n't disobey me as long as our bargain lasts , and you 're in no position to show yourself . BUSTER By Miss Janet , who is not in your service . She will go to the village at once and tell them you are sold to the Devil  --  she will herself lead a mob to the castle . You will be lucky if you reach the gallows .  --  Now enough . I dislike to threaten . Think it over for an hour , Master Cyprian .  --  Come , Luigi : let us draft the agreement . They go out through the waiting-room . The Moonlight Drunkard appears , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the porch . p. 146 CYPRIAN ( left alone ) . She 'd like nothing better ! If she gets me killed , she can go on to some livelier assignment ! THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD ( in a croaking voice ) . That 's just what they all want to do , dear boy ! You 'd much better leave them alone . CYPRIAN Oh , it 's you . THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD I just looked in for a moment to see how you were getting on . I 've been hearing about your wonderful work , but somehow I 've had the impression that you were n't really happy up here . CYPRIAN How did you hear about me ? THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD Oh , we gossip a good deal out there . CYPRIAN Have you got companions now ? THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD Oh , yes , indeed , dear boy . There 's quite a colony of us out there now : all the rarest and purest souls who have learned how to slip from the century and yet avoid the rigors of a monastic life . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how much brighter I 'm glowing ? CYPRIAN A little , perhaps  --  but you 're hoarse : you must catch cold staying out all night . THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD A very small price to pay for our freedom from all your vexations  --  from the worry of deciding which side to be on , from all those annoying factions , those princes and priests and people who are always trying to make one do things or prevent one from doing things ! p. 147 CYPRIAN I ca n't seem to get free of them now . THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD Why not ? Why not just steal away ? You can slip over the wall as I did . CYPRIAN I 've made such a mess of things here  --  I do n't want to run out and leave it . THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD You can always put the past to sleep . If you 'll only relax with us in the moonlight , you 'll find that all those nasty mishaps hardly trouble your sleep as uneasy dreams . CYPRIAN I ca n't do without my work  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DRUNKARD Oh , our brains are not idle , dear boy . We 've been doing some of the loveliest things with thought ! There 's one chap with a brilliant intellect who interfuses Aristotle with Plato  --  and a marvellous theologian who 's woven something absolutely shimmering out of the dual nature of Christ . A little bit unorthodox , perhaps , but nobody needs to know ! CYPRIAN Those things are not in my line , but the kind of thing I do want to do I do n't get a chance to do . I have a theory that matter and spirit are actually all the same substance , and that if only you could find out how that substance works , you could minister to body and soul both at the same time . p. 148 THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD What a charming idea !  --  and so simple ! CYPRIAN It 's not really simple  --  that 's the trouble : it 's so complicated it 's all one can do even to get hold of the problem . And the naggings and spyings and threats that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me to concentrate . THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD I told you that the same thing that took you here would eventually bring you to us ! CYPRIAN ( in a low voice , tempted ) . Where did you climb the wall ? Mr. B. appears from the porch , still carrying the coffin on his shoulder . THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD Is this Pan returned from the Golden Age ? MR . B No : a devil in an age of barbarity . THE MOONLIGHT DRUNKARD I must shrink from you , happy or damned . ( To Cyprian ) I leave you , but you know where to find me . Farewell till we meet again . He retires . MR . B You do n't want to meet him again ! CYPRIAN Yes : I 'd rather see you . Come in . Mr. B. sets the coffin down just underneath the skeleton . p. 149 CYPRIAN You still have to carry that ? MR . B What else can I do with it ? He wo n't let it rest . If I have it buried in Holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I bury it in a secret place , He sends someone to dig it up . Now , who is vindictive : He or I ? CYPRIAN I wish I could offer to help you  --  but I 'm in a worse jam than ever . MR . B So I gathered when they turned me away at the gate . CYPRIAN I 'm struggling with a genie now . He 's turned out to be a Moslem agent . MR . B I hoped you 'd last out the pact . CYPRIAN He 's recruited the devils to the Moslem faith , and he threatens to denounce me to the village if I do n't sign another agreement . MR . B I 'm afraid you 've played your cards rather badly . CYPRIAN I wish you 'd tell me how to play them ! Where did I make my mistake ? I ca n't seem to think clearly nowadays about matters of right and wrong . MR . B That 's part of the damnation , of course  --  and I 'm hardly the person to set you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you talked to me about your conscience . We only know conscience as something that can cook up good reasons for evil acts  --  but I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt . It turned out that your conscience had led you astray before our people even began to work on you . p. 150 CYPRIAN Please explain what you mean . MR . B Well , in the first place , you wanted to get rid of that lout who was supposed to succeed to the business , but you would n't admit it to yourself  --  and you wanted the girl , too , but you punished her for your grudge against your mother . CYPRIAN It is n't as simple as that . MR . B That 's what they always say . Of course , I only know the less favorable side . CYPRIAN I wanted to spare Claude . MR . B Spare him to make an ass of himself by playing a role for which he was n't fitted ?  --  to marry a woman that he did n't deserve and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong to yield to the weak  --  there 's always a fallacy in it , no matter what your Gospels may say . Nobody can really believe that the greater should give way to the less . When people make a virtue of that , it 's nothing but their own timidity . It was weakness , not decency , in you that made you so considerate of Claude  --  that was proved when the very next minute you fell a victim to that tenth-rate Italian lackey , and he gave you the uncomfortable comfort of having the poor clown suppressed . CYPRIAN That was stupid , inexcusable , of course  --  but what I do n't think you understand is that I 'd just given up God and that I had to preserve my own honor . p. 151 MR . B That I do understand : that 's the problem we 've got to master . But not too much self-abnegation ! There 's always something wrong , as I say , about the notion that the weaker should dominate . You may think that my opinion is biased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , and I still ca n't believe we were wrong  --  in spite of the unfortunate outcome  --  when we rebelled against the leadership up there . When our Archon set the universe going  --  He Himself was only half-conscious then  --  it turned out to be essentially murderous . To triumph or even to remain alive one had to crush other beings . That was just as much true in Heaven as here , and when we organized a faction of angels and had a showdown with the reigning group in an attempt to get parliamentary government , we were outlawed and made the scapegoats for the general cruelty and chaos that was just as much a nuisance to Him as to us . The role of destroyers was assigned to us while He went on posing as the great creator . But at that time the human race was waking up to a moral consciousness , and He knew that a corrective was needed if mankind were to accept His rule , so He generated a half-human agent who sympathized with human beings and who made it appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet He could n't pull the teeth of the natural laws that He had unleashed Himself . Even His Prince of Peace had moments when he became pugnacious , and when the Prince finally staked his credit on living up to an ideal of non-resistance , he left behind him such a heritage of discord , oppression , persecution and slaughter as no purely human leader has ever bequeathed to the world . p. 152 CYPRIAN But where shall we look for our principles ? I tried to resort to the Devil , but I did n't understand his real nature . MR . B Yes : Satan is also false . He is doomed to pretend that the destructive force is the only effective one . It 's high time that you human beings got away from both Satan and your Savior , and learned to depend on yourselves ! CYPRIAN ( apprehensive for fear Buster will come ) . But the damage is already done . I 've brought in these spirits now , and my problem is how to get rid of them . MR . B @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll swear to stand up for yourself and never to ask favors from the gods again . CYPRIAN By whom or by what shall I swear ? MR . B You ought to know better than I. Swear by the light of the mind . CYPRIAN My mind is half darkened now . I ca n't tell true ideas from delusions . As a doctor , I 'm partly a fake  --  I ca n't even be sure of my own research . MR . B I 'm going to clear that up . CYPRIAN Can you violate Satan 's arrangements ? MR . B You 're thinking of that scene in the Gospel where your Savior is graciously casting out devils , and the doubters are saying that his power must come from Belzebub . Your Savior replies that the Devil can never cast out the Devil  --  that he ca n't war against himself . ( With a touch of grimness and fierceness ) Well , we 'll see what a devil can do ! p. 153 CYPRIAN Has it never been done before ? MR . B Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my commands obeyed , I shall have to revert to  --  my appointed role . CYPRIAN Not forever ? MR . B Never mind about that . CYPRIAN I do n't want you to go back to Hell just to get me out of my mess . MR . B ( shrugging ) . Why not ? I 've failed to get free of the character that has been assigned me  --  look at that coffin there !  --  and I might as well use my position to give your cause a coup de main ! CYPRIAN I 'm not sure that I represent a cause any more . MR . B Come , come , boy !  --  the freedom of the intellect  --  the overthrow of Heaven and Hell !  --  This will be ticklish work for me . I 'm condemned to the negative pole , and I 'll have to fight against its attraction . As soon as I summon my forces , it will be hard not to use them for harm instead of to do you a service . I must try to catch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my old power but before I 've lost touch with my purpose . That moment I 'll use like a razor to slice your tormentors away !  --  Do n't be shocked , when I 've called them off , if I follow them straight to Hell . Remember that you must stay here  --  you 'll have to face a life of such moments . p. 154 CYPRIAN I 'm hardly in your position . MR . B Why , boy , you must always be choosing : how far to be ruthless and when to spare . Do n't be asking what principles you should act on . You 'll have to find that out as you go  --  and , in the meantime , you 'll have to be deciding in all sorts of situations and taking a chance that you 're right . But if you can learn to act correctly in these crises , you can make of us devils and our opposite numbers  --  and that hybrid Mohammedan monster  --  a flight of grotesque myths that will fade in the night of Time ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get free ? MR . B Never mind . That remains to be seen . CYPRIAN Who are you ? MR . B What does that matter ? CYPRIAN Belial ? MR . B No : not Belial . He picks up a parchment from the desk , scribbles something on it and tosses it over toward Cyprian . Luigi and the Little Devils appear in the double doors . Slingo has lost his tail . CYPRIAN ( to Mr. B. ) . Here they are to make me sign . MR . B Take it easy  --  and do n't be scared when I change . p. 155 CYPRIAN ( reading the name and looking up at Mr. B. with awe ) . The second in command ! LUIGI ( mocking Mr. B. ) . Gonstrono , Belzebub ! BONGO Gonstrono-gnthro , Belzebub ! STINGO Where are your horns , Belzebub ? SLINGO Somebody 's been shaving Belzebub ! BONGO ( singing ) Oh , Belzebub got a nasty snub:He tried to melt and soften ; But the Powers above would n't let him love:They spliced him to a coffin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . B ( who has been summoning his power , suddenly cutting them short ) . Skfrum ! skfrum ! stakfrum ! They stop at once , stunned , and huddle together . MR . B Stakp ! Stakfrum-shlee ! ( He gestures toward the porch . ) LUIGI ( now servile , spreading his hands in propitiation ) . Mele-kly-meelekeely , padradralni . Kanpas kanipolos-kedreon. p. 156 MR . B Shtsto-stakp  --  shlee ! LUIGI ( asking pardon ) . Pekisky pety-padradralny ! They walk backwards into the doorway , where they pause . MR . B ( with a peremptory gesture ) . Zoop-zoop ! They turn and rush away . Buster appears in the doorway , strongly illuminated . BUSTER ( to the Devils , roaring ) . Where are you going ? Get back here ! ( Seeing Mr. B. ) What is this ? Who are you ? What are you doing here ? MR . B ( to Cyprian ) . He 's impotent without his helpers . If you cease to believe in him , he 'll disappear . CYPRIAN But I see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'm real ! Disbelieve and the Crescent will cut you down . MR . B ( to Cyprian ) . An illusion ! CYPRIAN But I summoned him here . MR . B Then dismiss him . BUSTER ( laughing derisively ) . Who are you to dismiss me ? You begged me to dominate the castle , and now you ca n't do without me. p. 157 MR . B Do you swallow his ridiculous creed ? CYPRIAN No , of course not , but how can I kill it ? MR . B Then , damn it ! imagine the world for yourself  --  pit your mind against his ! CYPRIAN ( to Buster ) . Your faith is a sterile fanaticism ! your Prophet a cunning politician ! I oppose to them the word that convinces ! BUSTER You convince only yourself . My Master convinces millions ! MR . B ( in a low voice , to Cyprian ) . Tell him he belongs to the wrong sect . CYPRIAN You belong to the wrong sect ! BUSTER I expiated that in the bottle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and handing it to Cyprian ) . Tell him he ca n't live it down . CYPRIAN ( holding up the bottle ) . That 's a sin that can never be expiated ! You still belong to the wrong sect . Back to the bottle , Buster ! BUSTER ( his voice breaking and reverting to its earlier thinness ) . I confess my disloyalty , Allah ! I accept this eternal atonement ! There is no God but Allah , and Mohammed is his prophet ! Darkness : the shrill shriek of Buster becoming fainter and fainter . When the light goes on again , Cyprian is putting in the stopper . p. 158 MR . B Never appeal again to a power outside yourself ! That was your second mistake . CYPRIAN But how can I carry on here alone ? I 've had to have my liege lord 's protection in order to do anything at all , and now it looks as if I 'd got him down on me : I refused to do a poisoning job he wanted . MR . B ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own with another man , peasant or liege lord , you might as well go to Hell at once ! CYPRIAN If I only had Janet ! She 's still bewitched . MR . B Ah , Jezebel ! She must go , too . Where is she ? CYPRIAN ( nodding toward the right partition ) . In her room next door , I imagine  --  waiting to hear of my ruin . MR . B I 'll attend to that . You stay here .  --  I 'll send her to the grubbiest corner of Hell ! He strides out through the double doors . Cyprian looks after him a moment , then , left alone , begins to soliloquize . CYPRIAN Will she hate me ? Is Janet half Jezebel ? Shall I ever have her with me again ? Can we make our own world together alone in this castle here ?  --  between walls built by men like me to defend us from our treacherous fellows , under this roof that keeps off the rain and that screens us from the terror of the universe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written by men like me , with tools we have shaped ourselves ? I know that I can call on myself and summon in myself a magic that satisfies all my demands  --  that there are moments when the tangle of questions that were squirming like worms from my grasp lies suddenly as plain as an egg in the hand , when the fluxes of life that one never could seize stand revealed like the weave of an arras  --  when the very books leap from the shelves and open at the pages that speak to me , when the sentences stream from the pen to dazzle me with the new ideas that have never been given expression !  --  O Power that drives us and guides us ! O Spirit of Man that speaks , that imagines , that plans , that contrives !  --  in your name ( he stumbles with the difficulty of formulating his intention ) I decide that  --  I assert  --  I desire that  --   --  Cyrus bursts in from the waiting-room , in riding costume as before , but somewhat more handsomely dressed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old chap ? There was nobody around , so I just barged in . CYPRIAN ( with more cordiality than he showed on Cyrus 's previous visit ) . Oh , hello , Cyrus ! Come in . ( A fraternal embrace ) Sit down . Cyprian takes the throne behind the desk , but Cyrus , full of his mission , continues to stand while he talks . CYRUS I came a little earlier than you told me  --   --  CYPRIAN That 's all right : it does n't matter . CYRUS  --  but the situation is pressing . We need you for the King 's party , Cyprian ! CYPRIAN You need me in what capacity ? CYRUS As physician and mage to His Majesty . CYPRIAN What makes you think I can qualify ? CYRUS Why , everybody from here to Tancarville is talking about your miracles . They have even reached the ears of the King , and he has asked me to bring you to see him . Can you start with me tonight ?  --  at once ? CYPRIAN Not tonight  --  but we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Majesty ! He spoke to me with great condescension . It will mean a place at court for us both . p. 160 CYPRIAN How are Louis 's affairs going ? CYRUS Charles the Hothead has no chance against him . CYPRIAN What if he blockades Paris ? CYRUS The King has God on his side . CYPRIAN What makes you so sure of that ? The King has done some very dark things . CYRUS His Majesty 's exalted position exposes him to special risks : he has sometimes to resort to desperate measures . CYPRIAN He 's a cooler head than our Rody , but he 's not any closer to God . Rody imprisoned his father , but Louis 's supposed to have poisoned his . CYRUS I ca n't let you talk like that , Cyprian ! The King is our anointed sovereign . CYPRIAN We seem to have had this discussion before . CYRUS I do n't understand you , Cyprian : when we argued before , I supported the barons but you were most bitterly against them  --   --  CYPRIAN I still am  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their kennels yelping . Even my patron here has been trying to put the screws on me to make me do some of his dirty work . Mr. B. , returning with Janet , who , faint from the convulsions of dispossession , leans upon his arm . p. 161 CYPRIAN ( going on to Cyrus ) . Here 's Janet . ( Cyrus bows . ) A good deal depends on her . I 'll tell you something more definite later . Please leave us alone for awhile . You can wander around the place wherever you like . There 's no one to bedevil you now . CYRUS You must n't delay too long ! CYPRIAN I 'll try to let you know in an hour . Cyrus goes out through the double door . MR . B ( to Cyprian ) . I 've brought you a companion for your solitude . JANET ( rather dazedly ) . I tried to stand by you , Cyprian : I did n't let her drive me out . I warned you about the genie . CYPRIAN Oh , Janet : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes . CYPRIAN Will you work with me ? JANET Yes , of course . ( Catching sight of the cover on the tray ) But what about poor Claude ? CYPRIAN We ought to have had the sense to let him have what he wanted : that little house at the edge of the wood . JANET Is it too late to save him now ? p. 162 MR . B ( picking up the cover and addressing Claude ) . Snap out of that : you 're liberated ! Claude stands up behind the table . CLAUDE I told you I did n't approve ! MR . B Would you like the little house I 've left vacant ? CLAUDE No , thank you ! I 'm leaving the forest . I 'm going back to raise goats with my father . At least , I 'll be able to breathe and move , up in the mountains there . Here I 've been buried alive ! JANET Oh , Claude : I 'm so sorry it did n't work out ! CLAUDE I heard what was going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've all been too clever for your own good , and it ca n't go on like that ! I can tell you that our Savior was right when he said that the meek would inherit the earth . The good plain people will have their day ! Do you hear that , Belzebub ? He walks toward the waiting-room door . MR . B How depressing it would be if he were right ! JANET ( going after Claude ) . Goodby , Claude . Let me know where you 're going to live , and I 'll come up and help you get settled . CLAUDE Please keep away ! I sha n't need you . Janet stops ; Claude goes out . p. 163 MR . B And now , my good couple , I 'll leave you . JANET ( to Cyprian ) . You wo n't distrust me now ? CYPRIAN You wo n't despise me ? MR . B ( in a sharp contemptuous tone that startles them and makes them look round ) . That 's not going to be so easy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CYPRIAN You think so ? MR . B Oh , pay no attention : I told you I 'd become unpleasant . I 'll pick up my coffin and go . He lifts the coffin to his left shoulder . CYPRIAN Do n't you want to leave that here ? We 'll put it away in the vault . There 's no reason it should n't be safe now that our guests have gone . MR . B Have n't I told you it will never be safe ? He wo n't allow earth to receive it . But I 'll tell you what I 'm going to do : I 'm going to take it up there ! I 'm going to walk into His presence and thrust it under His nose and say to Him , " You knavish old tyrant , you 've punished my wife for her pity , you 've caused her to die in anguish , you 've insulted her very grave ! Is this your forgiveness and love ? What 's happened to your merciful Son ? ( Pounding the table with his fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still your same old shambles , where dog must still chew up dog , and our people grab the hindmost  --  and Our Father in Heaven amuses himself by twisting the Devil 's tail ! Now give rest to the bones of this saint and summon her soul to your side . Are you frightened of her long inquisitive nose and her quick understanding smile ? You may damn her , but it wo n't be the last of her : she 'll look up at you with wonder from down below  --  just a glance of her yellow eye , and she 'll make you feel a cad and a hypocrite  --  you 'll be sickened yourself with the scandal of your bigoted rotten reign ! " He carries the coffin to the double door and lights up when he has passed the doorway with an intensely bright rufous fire . p. 164 CYPRIAN Shall I wish you good luck ? MR . B If you 're not afraid . CYPRIAN At this moment I 'm not afraid of anything ! MR . B You men can remake the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flash he has vanished . They go to the door and look out at the late night sky . JANET Where is he ? Can you see him ? CYPRIAN ( pointing ) . There . He 's going like lightning : look ! JANET Is n't that the morning star ? CYPRIAN No : it 's moving .  --  That 's the star over there . JANET They named it for Satan , did n't they ? CYPRIAN " Quomdo cecidsti , Lcifer ? "  --  Lucifer , why did you fall ? JANET What 's the answer ? CYPRIAN Through pride , is the regular answer  --  but of course there was something else . JANET I hope he makes it .  --  ( Clutching Cyprian 's arm ) Oh , look ! What 's happened ? CYPRIAN He 's falling . p. 165 JANET Oh , poor Mr. B. ! CYPRIAN You admired him , did n't you ? JANET One ought n't to , perhaps . CYPRIAN I 'm going to make it , though . JANET You 're not going to storm Heaven ? CYPRIAN I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did your brother come to offer you something ? CYPRIAN The post of the King 's physician . JANET Oh , how splendid ! There 's no reason to refuse it now . CYPRIAN But I do n't want to give up my own domain  --  the kingdom of thought and art  --  for a corner of Louis 's court . Shall I put myself at Louis 's mercy , as Belzebub was at God 's ? Not for me : I 'll stay here in my castle ! Let them settle their quarrels without me  --  Charles the Reckless and Louis the Sly , the Crescent and the Cross that are always at war and one as bloody as the other ! Cyrus appears from the waiting-room . CYRUS I 'm sorry to interrupt  --   --  CYPRIAN I 've decided not to do it , Cyrus . CYRUS It 's your liege lord  --  he 's down below . I think that you 'd better see him . He 's angry about his steward , who 's robbed him and who 's joined the King 's party  --  he seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see . Cyprian is silent a moment , then quickly goes into action . CYPRIAN ( to Janet , indicating the visitors ' chair ) . Sedlem cntra taptas pne . She moves the chair against the tapestry while he goes to get the robe and cap and hastily puts them on . CYPRIAN Manculam experre . She works the crank on the arm of the chair , making the hands shoot out from the tapestry . CYPRIAN ( to Cyrus ) . Bring him up here , but not too soon . Try to stall him off a couple of minutes . Tell him I 'd gone to bed and had to get dressed to receive him . Cyprian picks up the skeleton and begins rigging it up outside the door . CYRUS It will take him some time just to get up the stairs . He 's suffering badly from gout . He seems to blame you for that , too . You see that the King is our only hope ! We 've got to fight it out at Paris . He opens the door to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll fight it out in this castle ! p. 167 CYRUS Look out : he 's started up already ! A thunder of grumbling and groaning is heard from the direction of the waiting-room . Cyrus hurries out and shuts the door . JANET Bno nimo sto ! CYPRIAN ( coming back from the doorway ) . Te magnpere mo ! JANET ta vro est ? CYPRIAN ( taking her in his arms ) . Mehrcle , ta vro.  --  Da mi bsium . She kisses him . She turns her head as the sound of the deep angry voice is heard just outside the door . JANET Dsine  --   --  accdit ! Cyprian moves quickly to his place at the desk , where he sits up straight in the throne and prepares a professional face with which to receive the visitor . Janet smooths her hair and dress and goes over to open the door . An atmosphere of tense expectation .                             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
