A hundred thousand people had come to Rawalpindi 's broad green Company Gardens to hear Liaquat Ali Khan , Prime Minister of Pakistan . Liaquat was in troubled territory : the Northwest frontier is full of tribal jealousies ; on one side Afghanistan disputes its borders , on the other lies rich Kashmir , held by India and coveted by Pakistan . <P> " Brothers in Islam , " Liaquat began-and at that moment there was a sharp report , then another . Liaquat fell to the ground , crying : " Goli lag gai ! " ( The bullet has hit me ) . <P> <P> The assassin , seated ten feet in front of the speaker 's stand , tried to break and run , but the shouting , screaming mob leaped on him . Moslem National Guards thrust at him with their spears . Fingers scooped out his eyeballs . One of his arms was torn off . Later , after Liaquat had died in hospital ( see NEWS IN PICTURES ) , police identified the dead assassin as Said Akbar , 29 , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol , probably made by native craftsmen of the frontier , where gunmaking is a common household industry . <P> Police had two theories:1 ) Said Akbar was no solitary fanatic , but a hired assassin ; 2 ) among his attackers were fellow conspirators who wished to silence him. * <P> The assassin 's Afghan origin might explain his motive-but Afghanistan hastily pointed out that he had been driven out of Afghanistan in 1944 for conspiring against the government . The other possibility was that he belonged to a sect advocating war with India over Kashmir . <P> Meeting on the night of Liaquat 's death , the Pakistan cabinet appointed as his successor Khwaja Nazimuddin . Roly-poly Nazimuddin , 57 , who looks like a jovial friar in his long black Moslem coat , has been Governor General of Pakistan since 1948 . Educated-like Nehru-at Cambridge , Nazimuddin opposed British rule in India , rose to be Premier of his native East Bengal , and in 1946 renounced his British knighthood . He is a devout Moslem , has made the pilgrimage to Mecca . <P> He is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought down Liaquat killed a good and able man , but failed to insure the rule of fanaticism . <P> <P> *A hired assassin has no friends . Mustafa Shukri Asho , who killed King Abdullah of Jordan last July , had expected to escape under cover of grenades thrown by fellow conspirators , but no grenades were thrown . His fellow conspirators had planned that Asho should be killed by guards ' bullets . On his dead body was found an Arab talisman bearing the words : " Kill , thou shalt be safe . " In 1942 the Macedonian who attempted to murder Franz von Papen , then Nazi Ambassador to Turkey , was given a contraption ( allegedly by Soviet agents ) which , he was told , would produce a smoke screen to cover his escape . When the assassin touched off the " smoke " bomb , it blew him to pieces .
