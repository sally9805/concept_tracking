The answers to the above questions will be chiefly limited to data from forecasting success in marriage . They will be taken up under the following main heads : ( 1 ) how successful are those who know the engaged couples best ? parents , friends , and the engaged themselves ? in forecasting their marital success ; ( 2 ) what methods are employed by competent analyzers in making forecasts of the success of a couple in marriage ; ( 3 ) how successful are they in their forecasts ; and ( 4 ) what ' are the respective merits of these methods of predicting and forecasting marital success . FORECASTS BY PARENTS , FRIENDS , AND THE ENGAGED PERSON In the study of 1000 engaged couples data were secured on the approval of the marriage by the parents of the couple and by two of the best friends of the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make forecasts of ( 1 ) the probability that the marriage would take place and ( 2 ) the probability of the success of the union . Each engaged person who filled out the schedule in effect also made a forecast in answering the question : " How confident are you that your marriage will be a happy one : very confident , confident , a little uncertain , extremely uncertain . " These data made possible a preliminary test of the value of forecasts made by laymen who are in close relation with the engaged couple . Accordingly answers will be sought to the following two questions : 1 ) Are parents , friends , and engaged persons able to forecast the success of marriages ? 2 ) If so , are their forecasts poorer , about the same , or better than statistical and case-study predictions made by trained investigators ? PARENTS ' APPROVAL OR DISAPPROVAL OF THE MARRIAGE The forecasts of the success of the couple 's marriage by the parents on both sides are implied in the answer of the engaged man and woman to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; your mother ? " Of course , disapproval of the match by parents may be based on other grounds than their belief that a union will be unhappy . For example , an overly possessive mother may oppose her son 's marriage to any girl in whom he is interested . Or , if a widow , her disapproval may arise from the fact that she desires that her son continue to be her financial support . Parents are also more likely than young people to stress economic considerations rather than the personal happiness of the couple and consc-  |p561  quently to disapprove of the suitor who is not able to support the bride on the level of living to which she is accustomed . In general , however , it may be assumed that in the majority of cases the father and mother perceive , or believe they perceive , factors in the combination of characteristics of the young people that will result in a successful or an unsuccessful marriage and approve or disapprove of it accordingly . Both members of the couple when they filled out the schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father approve of your marriage ? Your mother ? If either of parents or both disapprove , please state why . " The great majority of parents of the 1000 couples were reported as approving the match . There was practically no difference between the men 's and women 's parents in their attitude to the marriage of the couple ; 81.7 per cent of the young men 's and 80.5 per cent of the young women 's parents were said to approve the union . In most cases father and mother were-in agreement in their approval or disapproval . One method of testing the forecasts of the parents thus reported was to relate it to the outcome of the engagement relationship . Three years after marriage the following information was obtained on 830 of the original 1000 engaged couples : 131 had broken their engagements , while 666 of the couples who had married were still living together , and 33 were separated or divorced . Table 85 shows the relation of the parents ' approval or dis- figure  |p562  approval of the marriage to these outcomes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and separations represent failure , and marrying and remaining married stand for relative success . These data indicate that the parents are able to discriminate to some extent between the unions that will succeed and those that will fail . The parents of the young women tend to be the better prognosticators . They approved of 82.7 per cent of the unions which led to marriages that lasted three years or more ; and approved of only 64.9 per cent of those which led to broken engagements 1 and 72.7 per cent of the cases which ended in separations and divorce . The parents of the young men approved the marriages in 82.0 per cent of the engagements which resulted in marriages of three or more years duration , and in 77.1 per cent in which the engagements were broken , and 69.7 per cent in which the marriages ended in separation or divorce . The difference in these percentages are not statistically significant . When broken engagements , separations , and divorces are taken together as over against marriages surviving for three or more years the differences in the percentages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical ratio of only 1.8 which verges on statistical significance . The above discussion has implied that the approval or disapproval of the marriage by the parents may be taken as forecasting the success or failure , of the union . The point , however , can be made and with considerable justification that this very disapproval of the parents may be an important factor in breaking the engagement , in marital unhappiness , and in the disruption of the marriage . This actually occurs as shown by our interview data . This fact , however , does not diminish the value of the use of the approval and disapproval of the parents as a factor in predicting the success or failure of a union . But in further research the meaning of parental attitude in forecasting the outcome of the union should be ascertained . It is desirable to distinguish between disapproval based on a relatively objective appraisal of the , relationship and disapproval stemming from a prejudiced evaluation of marriage . FORECASTS BY FRIENDS Forecasts by friends were obtained in an indirect way . The engaged person was asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming marriage . The question was asked in the following form : " What is the attitude of your closest friend or friends toward your fiance(e) ? Approve footnote1 CR of difference between 82.7 and 64.9 is 3.9.  |p563  highly , approve with qualifications , disapprove seriously , disapprove mildly , are resigned to it . " As in the case of parents , the engaged person 's report of the approval or disapproval of fiance(e) by the closest friend was related to the success of the relationship as indicated by breaking of the engagement , by marryi ng and remaining married , and by separation or divorce . The results are shown in Table 86 , Attitude of Closest Friend toward the Marriage . figure The findings.of this tabulation indicate that the approval or disapproval of the fiance(e) by the closest friend of the engaged man and woman furnishes a better than chance forecast of the failure or success of the relationship as measured by the engagement being broken or by the marriage continuing for at least three years . The man 's closest friend is reported as approving highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage in comparison with 80.1 per cent of those which were broken , a difference which could occur by chance once out of twenty times 1 The corresponding difference for the reports of the closest friend of the young woman is greater : 84.2 per cent and 71.7 per cent , a difference which could occur by chance once in 369 times . ' In the case of the parents it was pointed out that their disapproval might he a real factor in the breaking of an engagement . This same effect may result from the attitudes of friends but , judging from the interview data , to . I lesser degree . footnote1 CR 2.0 2CR 3.0  |p564  It is noteworthy that the attitude of the girl 's closest friend provides a better indication of the success or failure of the relationship than that of the young man 's closest friend . There are at least two reasons for this . First , the girl is more likely to confide in her friend than is the young man in his closest associate . Second , women are perhaps more interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are based on better observations . The question may be raised why the forecasts of friends are not more accurate ? But are the judgments of friends always objective ? To what extent is their approval or disapproval based on superficial and immaterial grounds ? Does the closest friend resent the relegation of his or her friendship to a position secondary to that of the fiance(e) ? Does the closest friend feel that no man or woman is good enough for the engaged person ? It might also be asked whether the approval of the closest friend constitutes a better forecast of the success of the relationship than the approval of the parent . The findings are not conclusive . So far as they can be relied upon , they suggest that the approval or disapproval of either parent of the girl is superior to that of the friend of the man or the woman in indicating the outcome of the relation . FORECASTS BY THE ENGAGED PERSON One question answered by the engaged person involved a forecast of the success of the union . The item on the schedule read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a happy one ? Very confident , confident , uncertain , very uncertain . " The assumption is that in forecasting the success of the relation the response " very confident " should be associated with success and the other replies of " confident , " " uncertain , " and " very uncertain , " with failure . The objection might be made that the term " confident " should be a favorable indicator . The point , however , is that it represents less than full confidence and thus implies some uncertainty . It is interesting to correlate as in Table 87 the degree of confidence of the person in the success of the marriage with broken engagements and with separation and divorce , which represent failures in the relationship and with marriages which have continued more than three years , which stand for success . A comparison of reports of " very confident " in the first two columns shows percentages higher for those who have remained married than those  |p565  figure who broke their engagements . The difference is greater for women , 15.7 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8.7 per cent ( 78.2 and 69.5 ) .2 The greater discrimination of women in forecasting the success of the relationship is also evidenced by the even lower percentage ( 48.5 ) of replies of " very confident " in the marriages which ended in separation or divorce . What is the explanation of the superiority of the judgment of the engaged woman as compared with the engaged man upon the success of their anticipated union ? Different answers to this question might be hazarded . Perhaps women have higher intuitive ability . Or since marriage is more important to them , they may give more time and thought to the appraisal of the factors in the relationship making for its success or failure . Since in our culture the man takes the initiative in courtship and proposes marriage , the woman may frequently enter engagement with more reservations than her suitor . Then , too , she may be less disposed than her fiance to reveal her real self during the courtship and engagement period , which makes an accurate appraisal of the relationship more difficult for him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with the findings previously discussed in this chapter . The closest friend of the woman was also better able to appraise the relationship than was the man 's closest friend . Similarly , the approval or disapproval of the marriage by the girl 's parents proved to be more prognostic of the outcome footnoter CR 3.3 2 CR 2.0. 3 CR 2.7 ( of the difference between this per cent and 72.2 for couples married three years and more ) .  |p566  of the engagement than the attitude of the man 's parents . In short , the girl herself , her closest friend , and her parents all make better forecasts than the young man , his closest friend , and his parents . IMPROVING FORECASTS BY LAYMEN The evidence indicates that laymen are able to make forecasts of the marriages of young people . Although their prognostic efficiency is not high , they turn out to be better than chance . This raises questions for further research : Can these forecasts by parents and by friends be improved ? Is it possible to raise the level of accuracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might become an important part of predictive procedure . In what ways may forecasts by relatives and friends of the engaged couple be improved ? The forecasting value of parental approval or disapproval can doubtless be increased in several ways . First , the attitude of both parents toward the marriage should be secured directly from them as well as from the engaged son or daughter . Second , the reasons for parental approval or disapproval should be obtained . These reasons should be analyzed to determine their validity in relation to the probable success of the union . For example , an overly possessive mother may be hostile to every girl the young man has considered as a prospective marital partner . In such a case , her forecast , even if skillfully rationalized , would have to be discounted . Third , the reaction to the union should also be secured from the brothers and sisters of the young couple . In the study of 1000 engaged couples forecasts were reported by only two friends of each couple . One was a friend of the young man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prediction would result if the judgments of a larger number of friends were secured through direct reports by them to the investigators . For example , forecasts by five friends would reduce the distortion of the individual equation that is involved in the rating by a single person of the probable success of the marriage . Previous studies have shown greater reliability and greater predictive value where there are a group of raters rather than one . One person may overrate some one factor in the situation , or may be in so special a relationship of rapport that his judgment is affected . These and other biases tend to cancel out when they are averaged in the group judgment . Research should be undertaken to determine in a systematic way the degree to which forecasting by laymen may be improved . For example , it is important to find out the optimum number of friends from whom ratings of the probable success of the relationship of the couple should  |p567  be secured before diminishing returns of reliability and predictive efficiency are obtained . It also would be significant to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , close friends , less close friends , or acquaintances . VALUE OF FORECASTS BY LAYMEN Forecasts by parents , close friends , and by engaged persons have forecasting value . Their accuracy can , undoubtedly , be still further improved . It seems unlikely that they will come up to the high hopes which have been expressed for them and prove to be superior to statistical prediction . In fact , even with improvements that are possible they are likely to remain inferior . This does not mean that they should be discarded . Actually , they will be of value in supplementing other material secured by schedules and interviews from the couples . There is the possibility that they will throw light on aspects of the engagement and marriage relationship which are not illuminated by data secured from the engaged or married couple . A COMBINED FORECAST SCORE IN RELATION TO MARITAL SUCCESS The forecasts by engaged persons , their parents , and close friends were assigned scores and a combined score was then obtained . The correlation of this combined forecast score with marital success score on general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the total group studied . This correlation is somewhat lower than that of the engagement success score with the general satisfaction score ( .36 ) . They are , however , higher than might have been expected since they are based on only three items in the schedule . FORECASTS BY CASE-STUDY METHODS The forecasts of marital success made by parents , friends , and the engaged themselves were chiefly based on observation , acquaintance , and intuition . Psychologists and sociologists engaged in research or in counseling also make forecasts of marital success . They also may rely to some extent on observation and intuition . But in three respects their forecasts differ markedly from those of laymen . First , they are based on a more or less intensive interview or series of interviews with both members of the engaged couple . The analyst encourages the young people ( interviewed separately ) to tell all about themselves , their relationship , and other conditions which are significant for marital success . Second , he uses a more or less systematic  |p568  method in interpreting these data . Third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship of the young people all the knowledge , wisdom , and skill he has gained in studying other couples and in his specialized training in the sciences of human behavior . The ways in which the analyst proceeds in his analysis of the engagement relationship as predictive of marital success can best be understood by examining a case .

Dominance in marriage . I think I might be dominating in our relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I went into Y. W. work and became dominating through being in all positions . He will soon catch me if I become dominating . This is a human document . It provides an intimate revelation of the interpersonal relation of an engaged couple . The young people were interviewed simultaneously but separately . Thus there was no opportunity for them to consult each other . Yet one interview corroborates the other on the essential points in the relationship . The reader of these shortened interviews may wish at this point to make his own forecast of the success or failure of this marriage . He may wish also before reading further to set down the points in the personalities of the young people and in their relation to each other which he believes will make either for or against success in the relationship . If he makes his own forecast in this way , he will better understand the procedures now in use by analysts in counseling and research with young people . INTUITION As used here the intuitive method signifies an over-all forecast of the success of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of  |p574  the observer . It is his reaction to the case as a whole without consciously analyzing its different aspects and combining them into a forecast . No reason therefore need be given for saying " It is my belief that the marital relationship of this couple will be satisfactory . " Or , " I am convinced this marriage will be a failure . " If pressed for a reason for making an unfavorable prognosis for the case under consideration typical replies might be : " The young man is too serious ; he lacks a sense of humor which is necessary for a successful marriage . " " The girl is dominating which will become irritating to the young man after marriage and result in the unhappiness of both . " " They are not really in love , they only think they are because of the opposition of his mother . " The method of intuition is characteristic of the layman . But the analyst may also use it . He employs it consciously when he reads through an interview in order to immerse himself in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this experience he arrives at a judgment on the success or failure of the marriage . Sometimes at the end of an interview the analyst records his over-all impression of the probable outcome of the relation . At this time he has a more complete feeling of the case in its entirety than he has from later reading of the cold text of the interview . THE STUDY OF THE CASE AS UNIQUE A case may be studied in all its individuality and as far as possible without reference to other cases . This method recognizes the fact that each case is different from all other cases . Each case is a unique combination of factors and processes that may be studied , analyzed , and understood by examining how they operate in the given case . The attempt is to determine the unique configuration of factors in the case under consideration . Two methods are commonly used in the study of a case as unique . One is by sympathetic introspection , the other by empathetic identification . SYMPATHETIC INTROSPECTION By using the method of sympathetic introspection the observer puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he would feel and act if he were the other person . For example , the mother of the young man in the case just presented feels the marriage will be a failure . She is rigidly conventional , narrowly religious according to the strictest tenets of Presbyterianism . Persons , to her , fall into two groups ; those predestined to be saved and those foredoomed to be lost , and she places the girl in the latter category . A sorority member , placing herself in the situation of the young woman , p 575 might ask : " What does she see in him ? He does not know even how to mix with the fellows . " The reader may be interested in putting himself first in place of the young man and then of the young woman and in asking himself how he would feel toward them and how he would appraise the success of the marriage . Even the trained analyst who puts himself in the place of the different characters is likely to be affected by his own personal and social background and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is deeply religious in his outlook he may feel that the common religious interests of the couple guarantee the success of the union . If he is a strict Presbyterian he may be sympathetic with the point of view of the mother and , like her , predict the failure of the marriage . Or if a nonreligious and sociable individual , he may discount the religious factor and believe that the young man 's social backwardness will be adverse to successful married life . The analyst 's training affects his judgment . A sexologist might find evidences of sexual inhibitions in one or both of the young people and forecast their unhappiness in marriage . A psychoanalyst might point out early childhood conditioning which would make it difficult , if not impossible , for the two young people to establish a warm emotional relationship in marriage . A home economist might be greatly disturbed because neither the young man nor his fiancee had expressed any concern about her housekeeping and homemaking skill or lack of it . A sociologist interested in social stratification might stress the differences in social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth being in business for himself and the father of the girl only an employee ) and forecast that consequent difficulties would arise in marriage . These examples are sufficient to indicate the pitfalls of the method of sympathetic introspection . The analyst needs always to be on guard against interpretations derived from his own experience or from his specialized training . One way of counteracting this tendency is to take it into account . The analyst should conscientiously ask himself , " What would my reactions be if I were in the place of the subject ? " Thus he brings his bias into the open and recognizes it for what it is and can thus guard against it . The analyst may , however , turn the method of sympathetic introspection to advantage . He may ask how persons of diverse backgrounds and theoretical training would react ? Thus he gets a large number of perspectives through which to look at the relationship and the conditions that will lead to success and failure in marriage . The method of sympathetic introspection provides no reliable basis for  |p576  forecasting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more on the personal experiences , cultural background , and specialized training of the analyst than on the data in the interview . Consequently , for any case , such as the one now being examined , forecasts could be made ranging from failure to the highest degree of success . II EMPATHETIC IDENTIFICATION Empathy 1 is actually taking the role of the other , and identifying with him . Empathy also involves a later stage of detachment in which the observer makes an objective appraisal of the experience of sharing the other 's experiences and reactions . In the process of empathy the analyst first identifies himself with the young man . He tries to see the young man as he sees himself : a slightly built lad who withdrew from athletics , interested himself in his studies , and is backward in social contacts . He perceives that home life and the church have meant much to him . The analyst , like the youth , takes a serious view toward life , associating with girls in a formal rather than intimate way , and making friends with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understands how the young man gets into conflicts with his mother , finds satisfaction in his relations with his father who confides in him , reasons with him , and advises him about sex and marriage . He finds in his fiancee qualities which he values highly . She is " very reasonable . " She has " very good judgment . " She is " serious about serious things . " He recognizes that she is different from his mother and " more like my dad " with whom he is en rapport . The analyst then identifies himself with the young woman . He shares her experience of growing up in a family of lower social status than that of the young man ? a family which did not give outward expression of demonstration of affection , and he understands that she did not feel the lack of it . Her preference is for her mother in whom she confided , rather than for her father with whom she had quarreled in adolescence . She makes friends more easily than her father or mother . She likes to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings of insecurity about the " dating process " as she terms it . She kept company with five boys before meeting her fiance , but did not go steadily with any of them . In him she finds for the first time someone in whom she can confide and reveal her secret thoughts about life , religion , and marriage . footnote I For a fuller statement on empathy see pp. 624-626.  |p577  The analyst sees two serious minded , religiously motivated young people finding self-expression and personality development in their relation . The girl expresses it as " we 've grown together in our ideas and ways of doing things . " The picture of the mother of the young man is seen through the unsympathetic descriptions of the son and prospective daughter-in-law . She is depicted as narrow-minded , highly religious in a ritualistic way , and intensely Victorian in attitudes toward sex and marriage . The analyst , through sympathetic understanding , tries to capture a sheltered girlhood in a family of greater social aspirations than achievement , of an unhappy marriage compensated for by devotion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by adapting to the present . The young woman 's behavior , freer than that of her own girlhood , shocks the mother . She thinks the attraction of her son for his fiancee is based only on sex and can only lead to an unsuccessful marriage . She is sincerely troubled by the lower social status of the girl 's family . The analysis by empathetic identification leads to a forecast of a successful marriage . Both young people are getting what they want in a life partner . GENERIC EXPLANATION The analyst may apply the knowledge of human behavior which he has derived from his training and from interviews with other couples to an explanation of the information obtained in the interview with the subjects in this case . In so doing , he recognizes that any case is like other cases in one or more characteristics . In studying a couple during engagement the analyst may consider the case as a specimen . This means he examines the relationship of the young man and woman , not in all its individuality , but in those characteristics which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . If this case is considered in its generic aspects , then the knowledge we have of what makes for success or failure in the relationships of other couples may be applied to it . For a completely successful marriage the following conditions might be assumed essential : 1 ) The couple should be temperamentally compatible . 2 ) They should be sincerely and deeply in love . 3 ) They should be able to satisfy their own chief personality needs and also those of the other person .  |p578  4 ) They should place domestic values foremost in their hierarchy of values . 5 ) They should have vital common interests . 6 ) They should give evidence of being mutually adaptable . 7 ) The relationship should not be vulnerable to outside disruptive pressure , such as interference of in-laws and adverse economic conditions . This couple manifests all these conditions in a high degree . 1 ) They are compatible in temperament . There is evidence that under strain each might become irritable . This contingency , however , is one that would not be disruptive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They appear to be deeply in love with each other . 3 ) They seem to satisfy each other 's personality needs . He sees in her a wife who is reasonable , serious , and spiritual , and who will encourage him in business . She finds in association with him a companionship of mutual confiding and helpfulness. 4 ) Both place family life highest in their scale of values , although both are also interested in careers . But they feel that their vocational ambitions harmonize rather than conflict with their devotion to family life . 5 ) They have common interests . Chief of these is their mutual interest in personal religion which both regard as a strong binding tie . 6 ) They give evidence of mutual adaptability during engagement . The young woman states that " I 've learned a lot from him and I think he has from me . We both found things with which we could help each other . " Her course on marriage which both talked over has had its effect in their attitude both to family finances and sex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " men should handle the money . " They have read together one of the books on sex . 7 ) Their relation has the characteristics of integrity and adaptability that should make it invulnerable against outside pressure . The attitudes and the behavior of the couple correspond with the requirements assumed essential for a successful marriage . On the basis of this analysis a forecast of a highly successful marriage is made . If forecasts of marital success were made on a continuum from 0 as the lowest score and 9 as the highest , both the young man and the young woman might be graded as 8 . The reservation should be added that if  |p579  there were a difference the young woman might be inclined to give a more favorable report than would the young man of their marital adjustment . The question might be raised why both should not be assigned the highest score of 9 . The answer is that there are two circumstances that militate against granting this score . They are ( 1 ) the opposition to the marriage of the man 's mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eliminated and ( 2 ) the possibility of minor temperamental clashes . Two predictions , however , based on statistics , do not seem applicable to this particular case . The first of these is that the happiness of the parents ' marriages is associated with happiness of the children 's marriage . In this case the marriage of the young people should be more successful than those of the parents . The second is that the disapproval of one or more of the parents is associated with unsuccessful marriage . This prediction does not hold in this case since the disapproval of the young man 's mother appears to be based on prejudice and not on any condition that will be adverse to the marriage . Besides , the son does not feel closely attached to the mother and , in fact , has detached himself from her influence . But it must be recognized that the disapproval of a mother continued after the marriage has taken place will present a problem of adjustment . This is particularly so if she is a dominating person as is this mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her . FORECASTING TRENDS The point may legitimately be made that the most significant use of the case-study method is not to make forecasts of whether or not a marriage will be a success . Its real value should be to forecast trends in the relationship as they will appear in the first years of marriage . For example , in the case under discussion the following trend forecasts could be made : 1 ) There will be little or no conflict due to temperament . Such conflicts as arise will not seriously affect the relationship . 2 ) Love will increase in marriage , because it has a secure basis in emotional interdependence between the two persons and because it reproduces satisfying aspects of response patterns in the parental family . 3 ) Favorable to sex adjustment are their discussions and reading on sex and their adaptability . The husband will report greater satisfaction than the wife in their sexual relationship . 4 ) Children will be present and will be a matter of great satisfaction to both .  |p580  5 ) Common interests will continue to be satisfying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no serious disagreements are foreseen . 7 ) The mother-in-law will accept her son 's wife , at least outwardly , but they will not be friends ; she will continue to be critical of the latter and will constitute a problem in the marriage . This couple was reinterviewed five years after their marriage . Their marital relation had been subject to severe stresses and strains . These included the illness and unemployment of the husband , a difficult child birth for the wife , and moving to a distant part of the country . How well the marriage stood these and other tests is evident from a reading of pertinent quotations from the interviews : MAN We feel we are ideally suited to each other . We have had our difficulties like others . We feel we are better adjusted than most people . What is the biggest thing you have gotten out of marriage ? We have been able to do things that I would n't be able to do alone if I did n't have anyone to back me up . We have our children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our life . What is the next biggest thing which you obtained in marriage ? What we have done together and with our children . I believe marriage is the only way to enjoy life . You see it through four eyes instead of two eyes . What was the biggest adjustment that you had to make in marriage ? At first Irma 's lack of order upset me . How she can prepare a meal in a clutter I do n't understand , but she does and I have gotten over that . Relatives are the only trouble . My father and mother interfered . We went to Florida to get away from our folks . In what ways do your temperaments clash ? Irma is excitable and I do n't get excited . She reacts faster than I do , that is all . Her temperament is good and I would not ask for better . The only thing that causes disagreement with us is when I go ahead and form a decision and have not taken time for her to go through the same process of thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How would you describe your personality and temperament ? The trouble with me , I think about things and do n't say anything about them . I am somewhat moody . I do n't particularly like a group of people . She likes to get out in a group more . She is at home all day ; I am out all day , I have had my contacts . She goes to her woman 's club . I am not a club man and do n't go in for clubs . I stay home with the kids and she goes out to her club .  |p581  Do you need sympathy and encouragement ? I do n't always need sympathy and encouragement , but I like it . Irma is very good about giving it . When I need help and encouragement she comes up . If there are two to help each other it makes a lot of difference . A few words at the right time give you new breath . Parents . Outside of Father being very domineering , which Irma is not , she is more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad and she should never have married . I know they do n't cooperate like we do . What little married life we have had has been more successful than either of our parents ' family . Mother is very strongly religious and has always harped to me on that . We find staying over a week with either of our relatives requires too much adjustment on their part and on our part . What change has taken place in your love for your wife since marriage ? When you have trouble with the outside world and your love for each other matures , it grows beyond the fresh bloom of romance , something that is more steady . We say that we feel our love has grown for each other . When we are apart we realize how much we miss each other . We find a good deal of satisfaction in each other . We have grown to depend on each other . What problems of sexual adjustment have you had during your marriage ? We felt that we had no sex adjustment . We were very happy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are attuned to each other . It is a great part of marriage . What are your chief common interests ? We are both creative . We both like to make things , toys , odd pieces of furniture . We get a thrill out of redecorating our house ; we made something out of it with simple things . We like good music . I like shop work and like to tinker . Irma likes to make her own dresses . Children take a great deal of time . If you raise children well , it takes all your time . We have given up things and devoted ourselves to them . Like everybody else , we think we are doing a better job than anyone else . What do you think is most worthwhile in life ? Making a lot of money is not our point in life , we decided . We think enjoying yourselves and living in your family is worth more than any financial , social success you can have . We are creating a community of ourselves and family . Playing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our life . Religion ? My mother insisted we go to her church , and we did n't like the church or minister . We looked around and found a church we liked . We realize we owe it to our children to go to church . Do you feel that your personality has changed since marriage ? If I was selfish , Irma has helped me to become less selfish . If I was hasty , she has  |p582  helped me to be not so hasty . She has done me a lot more good than I have done her in improving personality . Do you feel that your wife 's personality has changed since marriage ? Her personality has not changed much . After five years of marriage we do n't feel much older or look much older . You do mature . You become less hasty and become more conservative . We have grown some but have not become new persons . We have been very happy together . Sometimes something will come up . We have momentary disagreements . As a sum total you would not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other , except I could have improved in tolerance . WOMAN What is the biggest thing that you have gotten out of marriage ? Working together with someone , and that is a big satisfaction . At home we never worked together . We like to create , not only build furniture , we like to read , and our children ? it is just a revelation to see the boy grow and putting theory into practice is sort of a challenge . We just get such a kick out of comparing notes , that is just about all we live for . The boy 's interest I was our sole concern for a while . We do things together . I do not think I could be happy in a career alone . I have always wanted a home and I intend to keep it . Your biggest adjustment ? I have contended right along that marriage is a series of adjustments . I think it is the person who adjusts who makes a success of marriage . His mother can not adjust . It has been the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure to me . I do it because it is part of my job . Fortunately my husband helps me . He has done everything he could from washing to cleaning . We decided the only way is to do things together . When I need help he helps me , and when he needs it I help him . We have a few friends , not because of prestige or money or anything . My outlet is the Woman 's Club . Your adjustment to husband 's personality ? We went together for three years . I think I always wanted what he represented . We do have our disagreements naturally . He is critical . For a while I was in poor health , and I did let him do an awful lot of work . He felt he was doing a lot of housework . We do not outwardly criticize . We sit down and talk it over . Is he more dependent on you than you on him ? He was , after his illness , now he buoys me up . I got discouraged after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me see that it is just part of it . He has been more en ? couraging lately than I. What problems of sexual adjustment ? I believe my enjoyment grows an his does too . We are so much ahead of when we were first married . It is  |p583  hard for him , I know , while I am pregnant but he is very nice . I have to be completely free from worries to enjoy it and we usually are . It means an awful lot to him I know . When things get tough we express our love in intercourse . I 've gotten so I do not worry about any problems in advance . I have had to conquer worry . Things usually work out if not in the right way , it works out some way . Has religion been important to you ? Mighty important . We had a very lovely church and made our best friends there . We liked it because of our friends . We would very much like a good church again . Fred would not be in it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as much as I do . Once he gets to know a person and like him then he is friendly . It is hard for him to get acquainted . What change has taken place in your love for your husband since marriage ? At first it was ecstatic . Now it is not thrilling but it is a lot stronger , a lot deeper . You feel it in everything you do for each other , and have more or less outgrown the thrill . Though we still thrill at times . Do you feel your personality has changed since marriage ? I think I 'm more subjective . I can still feel secure in a group , but I do like getting away and being by myself ? the quietness of home . Who takes the lead in the marriage relationship ? I imagine I take the lead . He is more concerned with working for himself . If I want to get out , I have to more or less do the suggesting and make the plans . However , when it comes to something important , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by empathetic identification and by applying generalized knowledge stood up well . In fact , a score of 8 was given to the reports of both husband and wife on their marital success , which is in agreement with the forecast . Even more significant was the corroboration of the outcome in marriage of the trends projected from the engagement period : 1 ) Conflicts arising from temperament were present but were of minor significance . 2 ) Both report their love had increased and deepened in marriage . 3 ) Sex intercourse was satisfying to both , particularly to the husband . The wife 's enjoyment seems in part due to his satisfaction . 4 ) Children are the center of interest of both husband and wife . 5 ) Common interests are a strong binding factor . 6 ) Decisions seem in general to be made by mutual discussion without serious disagreement . The husband reports that he makes decisions before  |p584  discussing them with his wife . But she states that she actually takes the lead in marriage . This is confirmed by Dr. Lu , l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The mother-in-law has been a problem in the marriage . She has , however , not been able to influence her son against his wife . Four general statements may be made about forecasting methods from the reading and the analysis of this case . 1 ) The reader of the interviews gets a sense of acquaintance with the two young people . He is able to understand their relationship and how each looks at it . 2 ) He perceives the advantages and the limitations of the different procedures of making forecasts from interviews : intuition , sympathetic introspection , empathetic identification , generic explanation , and trend projection. 3 ) He realizes the values of using the last four methods in making a forecast of marital success in this case . 4 ) He understands that each method of forecasting involves the passing of a judgment by the analyst . This may be an over-all judgment , as in intuition , or a series of judgments on different aspects of the relation which may or may not be integrated into a general judgment . The judgment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ methods that depend on human judgment ? Are they as good as or better than statistical prediction that eliminates judgment ? Certainly a correct forecast of marital success in one case can not be relied upon to answer these questions . // Analysts usually make forecasts on individual cases . They seldom , if ever , review a large number of cases to find out the accuracy of their forecasts . Yet it is feasible and desirable to determine the accuracy of the forecasting method . I footnote For description of her study , see pp. 637 ? 652. 2 This section ( pp. 584 ? 588 ) was prepared by Bernard Farber who has analyzed the ratings made by 30 analysts of interviews secured by Burgess and Wallin . For a complete statement see his Ph.D . dissertation , An Evaluation and Revision of the Burgess and Wallin Rating Scale as a Prediction Instrument . Chicago ( University of Chicago Libraries , 1953 ) .  |p585  TESTING THE ACCURACY OF CASE-STUDY FORECASTING There are two chief ways of determining the accuracy of forecasting methods . One is to consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be especially applicable to intuitive judgments of success or failure in marriage . This procedure will not be considered here . The other is to analyze the different aspects of the case and to rate each in its relation to marital success . This is the method that will be discussed because it gives a rigorous test of forecasting efficiency . The data on engaged couples found in personal documents ( including interviews ) can be analyzed according to various areas of experience assumed to be crucial to the success of the marriage of the couple . These crucial experiences define for the engaged person his relationship to the fiance(e) as someone with whom he will be living in the role of husband or wife . If it is assumed that these experiences provide a basis for continuity and consistency , then it should be possible to forecast success in marriage from experiences before marriage . To sensitize the case analyst to certain crucial experiences or dynamic factors , and to enable him to combine his evaluation of the data pertaining to the separate factors into a total forecasting score , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each of the dynamic factors was rated on a five point scale from plus two to minus two , according to its probable effect upon the integration of the couple . The scores for the factors were then totaled to give a forecasting score for the person . Inasmuch as certain experiences might have different effects upon the man and the woman , the men and women were given separate forecasting scores . The experiences or dynamic factors which were felt to be crucial in the integration of the couple were grouped , following the Burgess and Cottrell findings , under five general headings : ( 1 ) psychogenic characteristics , ( 2 ) response attitudes and patterns , ( 3 ) social relations and activities , ( 4 ) cultural factors , and ( 5 ) the economic factor . Some of these general areas of experience were treated as a unit in the rating scale ; others were divided into subcategories . In all , the rating scale was composed of fourteen factors : I. Psychogenic characteristics . 1 . Temperamental compatibility . II . Response attitudes and patterns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship ( parental image ) . 4 . Extent of love .  |p586  5 . Satisfaction with demonstration of affection . 6 . Sex adjustment . III . Social relations and activities . 7 . Attitude toward children . 8 . Common interests . 9 . Relationship with friends . 10 . Relationship with parents and in-laws . IV . Cultural factors . 11 . Cultural background ( ethnic , social class , and familial customs and traditions ) . 12 . Philosophy of life . 13 . Religion . V. Economic factors . 14 . Difficulties and satisfactions due primarily to economic reasons . Over thirty persons 1 used the rating scale to predict marital success for the 226 engaged couples interviewed in the Burgess-Wallin study . About 1000 forecasts were made for these couples . In the evaluation of these forecasts , the forecast scores given by the several raters for each case were averaged and the Marriage Success Score used as a criterion of marital success . For each of the 14 factors , a high or plus rating was regarded as being prognostic of success in marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being prognostic of failure in marriage . A factor was considered as highly predictive of success or failure if the probability that the observed proportion of correctly forecasted successes or failures due to chance errors in sampling was less than five per cent . The results obtained by relating each factor separately with the marriage success scores are shown in Table 88 . Five of the 14 factors ? sex adjustment , attitude toward children , relationship with friends , cultural backgrounds , and religion ? showed no relation for either men or women to marital success or failure . These findings do not mean necessarily that these premarital factors are not significant for marital success . They may only document the point that relevant data were not obtained in the interview . For example , statistical analysis of schedule material indicates that premarital attitudes toward having children are correlated with marital success ? The factors important in forecasting success in marriage for both men and women are temperamental compatibility , early response relationships , ' These 30 persons were mainly graduate students enrolled in seminars . They included in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons with little or no college education . 2 See pp. 546-553.  |p587  figure The differences in accuracy of forecasting for the men and for the women by means of the various dynamic factors seem to stress the differences in the masculine and feminine meaning of marriage . Those factors which are merely stabilizing for the man achieve a greater significance for the woman . For the man , satisfaction with demonstration of affection increases his satisfaction in marriage , but , for the woman , economic security increases satisfaction with marriage . Common interests play an important role in the success or failure of marriage for the man but not for the woman . On the other hand , relationship with parents and in-laws , which is significant in determining the importance of domestic roles for the person , is a stabilizing influence for the man and becomes even more crucial for the woman . All of these findings seem to support the notion that , on the average , tmarriage for the man has primarily an affectional and recreational meaning , while for the woman the career aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high importance The question is sometimes raised as to whether it is worthwhile to examine the dynamic factors in forecasting instead of relying upon statistical prediction alone . When the ratings for the dynamic factors are added as a total forecasting score , the correlation coefficients between the rating scale forecasting score and the marriage adjustment score are .42 for the men and .39 for the women . For the cases rated , the engagement adjustment score was correlated with the marriage adjustment score ; the coefficients of correlation are .32 for the men and .38 for the women .  |p588  These findings indicate that at present case-study forecasts are not superior to statistical prediction and may perhaps be inferior . This may only reflect , however , the present pioneer stage of the development of personal documents , including interview data . On the basis of a factor analysis of the items Farber made a revision of the rating scale . The new scale consisted of the following factors : temperamental compatibility , intimate role needs , emotional dependence , companionship , philosophy of life , sex identification , flexibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test of the efficiency of prediction by use of the rating scale as compared with over-all unguided judgments . The number of cases analyzed by the two methods was 100 by Judge 1 , 50 by Judge 2 , and 46 by Judge 3 . The coefficients of correlation of their judgments and of their ratings with the marriage adjustment score by the two methods are as follows : figure The predictions of all three judges by the use of the revised rating scale is higher than the forecasts based on their judgments . In the case of Judge 1 the difference for the men approaches statistical significance ( CR 1.9 ) and the difference in correlations for the women could occur by chance but once out of 300 times ( CR 2.9 ) . The results of this comparison of unguided judgments should be considered as tentative until they are confirmed by further research . COMPARATIVE EFFICIENCY OF CASE-STUDY FORECASTING AND STATISTICAL PREDICTION Comparisons of the predictive efficiency of case-study forecasting and statistical prediction indicate the superiority of the latter . This conclusion has been reached not only in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making good on release from prison on parole , and of selecting students for training in clinical psychology . ' Two points , however , should be made . Case-study analysis is still in footnote1 Theodore R. Sarbin , " A Contribution to the Study of Actuarial and Statistical Methods of Prediction , " American Journal of Sociology , 48 , 1943 , pp. 593 ? 603 ; Robert Schiedt , Ein Betrag zum Problem der Ruckfall Prognose ( Munich : Munchener Zeitungsverlag , 1936 ) .  |p589  i s i .. , ancy . Methods of procedure remain to be worked out and standardized . At present , interpretations of cases seem less determined by the content of the interview document than by the personal equation of the ovestigator and by the conceptual system which he applies to the case . ialysts need training and experience in case-study methods . For example , n making case studies of marriage they should learn first of all not to be , nfluenced in their judgments by a feeling of like or dislike for the husband or the wife . Second , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the behavior and attitude of the couple in terms of their own values or of the behavior that is approved in their own social class . Third , it is necessary to think of the attitude and conduct of the young people in empathetic and analytical rather than in moral terms . Fourth , it is essential not to be rigidly influenced by any one conceptual system , but to maintain a receptive attitude to any applicable interpretation from all the available frameworks of explanation of human behavior . Lastly , the analyst should constantly exert himself to formulate explicitly the basis of his judgments and interpretations , so that when these are not confirmed by his forecasts he can learn by his mistakes the errors in his interpretation and thus improve his method . In these and other ways the efficiency of case-study prediction can be raised . Forecasting the success or failure of a marriage is one of the he , ; ways of subjecting the interpretation of a case to the crucial test of its outcome . This procedure sets up a pragmatic measure by which future forecasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly be raised , is it legitimate or significant to judge the forecasting efficiency of interview data by the standards of statistical prediction ? Should it not rather be appraised by criteria appropriate to the nature of this method ? Is not projection of trends a more valid procedure ? This point obviously is pertinent . The question of the efficiency of forecasts from interview data will not be settled until it is effectively tested . It is well known that clinicians vary in the degree to which they possess the skills which are associated with successful case analysis or treatment . In all fairness the test of forecasting efficiency of case study should be the success achieved by those most successful in its use . The distinctive characteristic of the interview method is its effectiveness in revealing the dynamic configuration of factors in the relationship of the engaged couple . This suggests that its function in the prevision of marital success will not be in terms of indicating gradations of a criterion such as happiness . Rather it will be in forecasting the trends of the dynamic factors in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forecasts . One or more of these can be based on different possible contingencies . If event a , then this will happen , but if event b , the outcome will be otherwise . Forecasts car be made with such qualifications and their efficiency assessed in terms the particular contingency which arose . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Forecasting is a method with great human appeal . It is congenial to the thinking and understanding of the average man . It develops out of common sense and remains in close contact with it . Forecasting marital success is a pastime in which everyone participates . This chapter presents for the first time some positive evidence on the accuracy of judgments passed by parents , friends , and by the engaged persons themselves on the prospects of marital success . In fact , these forecasts I are sufficiently valid to justify their enlarged and systematic use in future prediction studies . But these forecasts by laymen are probably not as accurate as those made by analysts specializing in marriage counseling and research . The latter have the advantage of training in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples . They have developed procedures for obtaining and interpreting the experiences of engaged persons that are crucial for marital success . Their chief procedures are : intuition , sympathetic introspection , empathetic identification , generic explanation , and trend projection . The first two have only a limited value . Both of them are subject to the misleading effects of the personal experiences and social background of the analyst . The other methods are much freer from this objection . They are recommended for use in case-study forecasting . Success in work with these procedures depends not only upon training but upon the ability of the analyst to develop understanding and skill through the interpretation of many cases . The projection into marriage of dynamic trends in the engagement relation appears to hold real promise for case-study forecasting . The assumption is that the crucial experiences of the couple before marriage have already set the significant patterns of the relation . Among these are the nature and degree of their love ; their temperamental compatibility ; their emotional interdependence , dependence , and independence ; the vitality of their common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authority and method of making decisions ; their adaptability , and  |p591  the vulnerability of their relation to the adverse impact of interference by friends and parents , by economic conditions , etc . All methods of forecasting have one common characteristic . They require the making of judgments by the analyst . They all depend upon uman judgment which is notoriously fallible . On this point forecasting is 1.1 sharp contrast to statistical prediction which eliminates the personal - quation and relies upon methods which if faithfully followed by different , Dtalysts always result in the same prediction . One solution of this central problem in forecasting is to find out the basis for errors in judgment and thus to reduce them . Several sources of error have been identified . Among these are the personal experiences and social background of the analyst , overspecialization in his training , overestimating the role of some factors and underestimating that of others . These and other sources of error may be corrected at least in part . The analyst can become aware of these influences affecting his judgment . The forecasts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averaged , thus reducing the chance of errors affecting the forecast . Research on methods of forecasting should result in improving their efficiency and in reducing sources of error . Analysts should receive better training in forecasting procedures . At present , no conclusive answer can be given to the question of the future role of case-study forecasting . As compared with the relatively easy task of asking subjects to fill out schedules for statistical prediction , interviewing is time consuming both for the person interviewed and for the investigator . Only one incontestable value can at present be freely conceded to the credit of the interview , namely , its usefulness in the exploratory phases of studies of marital success . Interview data are invaluable in providing hunches , clues , and fruitful hypotheses . Once these are obtained from the interview they can be translated into items to be included on the schedule for statistical prediction . Forecasting from interview data may yet prove to be as accurate or even Snore accurate than statistical prediction but it remains to be demonstrated . The method , as we have stressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve great improvement . Certain ways in which persons may become better analysts of interview material have been suggested . Research might well be undertaken to obtain more knowledge of the conditions blocking the development of the forecasting method . One unsolved problem , as we have seen , is the extent to which the personal equation and the conceptual viewpoint of the analyst , rather than the content Df the interview , determine his forecast of marital success .  |p592  M ARRIAGE IS A PROCESS OF ADJUSTment of husband and wife to marriage and to each other . Adjustment in marriage and to one 's spouse means those changes in the attitudes and behavior of husband and wife which mutually fulfill their marital expectations and wishes and so make for the success of the marriage . Burgess and Cottrell state that a well-adjusted marriage may be defined as one " in which the attitudes and acts of each of the partners produce an environment which is favorable to the functioning of the personality of each , particularly in the sphere of primary relationships . " 1 One of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welladjusted personalities makes for success in engagement and marriage . The second is that a successful marriage is one that furthers the development of the personality of husband and wife . Adjustment in marriage is the continuation of a process which began when the couple first met . The prior adjustments in engagement are important for those that will take place in marriage . One wife in our study was keenly aware of the relation of adjustments taking place in marriage to those prior to it . WOMAN . I think our adjustment process has been a slow and growing one . I do n't recall any adjustment as sufficiently major to be painful . Before we were married we had gone through a lot of adjusting together and when I stood up with him to be married it seemed a most natural and inevitable thing to happen . Married couples , in general , recognize more or less clearly that marriage consists of a series of continuous adjustments . They are realistic . They know marriage is not a static condition of bliss . WOMAN . Marriage has been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continual working on . I can think of movies and old-fashioned story footnote1 Op. cit. , p. 10. 592  |p593  books that said that couples married and lived happily ever after ; as if that was all there was to it . MAN . Our marriage did n't stand still . There was the thrill of furnishing things . Now we are passing into another stage of having a family . It seemed as if we moved from stage to stage so there have been no dead spots in it . Marriage is then a process of adjustment of husband and wife in which their personalities either achieve fuller expression or reach a dead level of routine activity or are frustrated . This chapter is concerned with the problems of adjustments of husbands and wives : ( 1 ) their adjustments to the new experience of marriage ; ( 2 ) their adjustments in the different areas of marriage ; ( 3 ) the question of the greater adjustment made by husband or wife and ( 4 ) the effect of length of time married upon the process of adjustment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of middle-class husbands and wives report no major adjustments which they had to make . Typical responses to the question asked three or four years after marriage " What was the biggest adjustment you had to make in marriage ? " are the following statements : HUSBAND . I never did consciously adjust myself very much . There were undoubtedly unconscious adjustments made . As far as making an adjustment , it went very smoothly . In fact , I was more prepared to making adjustments and I was surprised when I did n't have to . We had known each other for a long time , but I was pleasantly surprised about what a good wife she made . I was surprised at her as a housewife . It worked out right fine from the start and it 's been fine ever since . WIFE . Robert and I knew each other so long before we were married that there was very little adjusting to do . We went away from friends and people and we were just dependent on each other and we had the advantage over a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have known each other we have never had a serious argument , that is unusual , is n't it ? Some couples find it difficult to recall even minor matters of conflict , as in the following case : HUSBAND . The whole marriage has gone so smoothly I have not consciously noticed any adjustments that had to be made . Once in a while our desires for amusement have conflicted , but not very frequently . footnote Interviews in Burgess-Wallin study . See also Judson T. and Mary Landis , " Length of Time Required to Achieve Adjustment in Marriage , " American Sociological Review , 11 , 1946 , pp. 666-77.  |p594  ' WIFE . One of my pet phrases is that there was so little conscious adjustment . We got to know one another very well before we got married . All that I can think of now are small things , like my learning to screw up the toothpaste at night after use . And I have taught him to go to bed early , because now he - knows I have to have enough sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the biggest thing . Almost invariably husbands and wives , as in the above cases , who report no difficulties in adjustment attribute it to their long acquaintance before marriage or to the intimacy of their association during engagement . Other statements to the same effect are : HUSBAND . We fell into married life with little adjustment . We had been seeing each other every night for two or three years . WIFE . I do n't know that I have made any adjustment and I do n't think he has because we went together so long before marriage . WOMAN . We have n't had much trouble because we had known one another since we were four years old . I knew his shortcomings before I was married to him ; so I did not have to adjust to them . I was prepared for them . I had practically even lived with his family so I knew everything about him . WOMAN . There were no extended adjustments to be made . I ca n't think of any . I had been going with him so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after marriage . MAN . I think we would have had more adjustments if I had not been in school with my wife . A good many adjustments that come after marriage were worked out by us before marriage in the two years that we were engaged . Occasionally , husband and wife disagree on the question of whether or not there were major adjustments . Sometimes , as in the following marriage , the wife took upon herself so completely the role of adapting herself to her husband that he was almost oblivious to what had taken place . WIFE . There was very definitely an adjustment . There have been several . I have learned to center myself around him and his work . I have had to adjust my life to him more than he has had to adjust his to mine . As he is the bread winner we have to adjust our lives to him . What we eat and when we sleep and when we can take recreation , for instance . When I am tired , I have had to learn to control that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired he does not especially like to come home to be sympathetic and I do not blame him either . Then we had an adjustment to make when the baby , the first , arrived . I always knew you had to put the father first and I had to learn to do that . It works pretty well now ; the children get most of my attention when he is not around and I try to make him the center when he  |p595  is around . He appreciates it , I 'm sure . Even the way I dress . I dress to please him . I had to learn to do that . HUSBAND . We did n't have much adjustment to make . It was not difficult for us at all . We were both pretty young . My wife , as all wives , has catered to me in eating and matters like that and so perhaps she has had to make the bigger adjustments . It was easy for me . I have not had to do anything unusual . I think probably she has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . I have not had to make any . Both may report a problem of adjustment but , as in the following case , only the wife experiences difficulty in its solution . HUSBAND . I do n't think I had any big adjustment to make . The biggest adjustment Nellie had to make was to live with me . She is different in temperament . She is highly excitable and I am methodical . For her to tone down to my slow level was a serious adjustment . The managing of the household was to her an adjustment because she had never had to do that before , and the first part of the time we were married she was still working . To do both ? work and keep house ? was quite a difficulty . She did not like her work . She worked for purely monetary reasons . Our differences in temperament make for considerably less difficulties than at first in marriage . Now , we adjust without any clash . With reference to financial matters , my tendencies are along methodical lines . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling on the matter was entirely different . Her previous experience indicated that it was no use . So for a time we argued about this necessity . We used it for a period of three months then we dropped it for a while . Then we agreed it was needed . We do it now . WIFE . My biggest adjustment was having to live with a person who is entirely of a different nature . For example , we have a budget and I have to account for what I spend , and that is not like me at all . Bill likes to spend quiet evenings and I like excitement . He does n't care how he is dressed and I like to be dressed and like him to dress . We made a bargain when we married each to retain as much individuality as possible . But in spite of myself , you know , I had to adjust to the other person . In the beginning the adjustment was almost an impossibility . We used to have very extensive arguments . Now we very rarely have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more keeping company than since marriage . But I have realized that , although I rebelled , his was the right way , the way we had to live . I used to rebel about his dress , the budget , the staid existence we were living . I used to work , and then I did n't have to give in , but since I have stopped working my husband has definitely taken over the authority . He likes to live within his income and even to save . I have always wanted to spend to the last penny . Now , I feel we have become adjusted to one another . I do n't feel resentment to Bill but to the conditions that make the  |p596  adjustment necessary because we do n't have sufficient income to live the way I would like to . MAKING MARITAL ADJUSTMENTS ence of minor conflicts . Married persons make a distinction , not always too sharp , between adjusting to marriage and adjusting to one 's spouse . ADJUSTING TO MARRIAGE Marriage necessitates taking new roles irrespective of the particular per-son one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be achieved , the giving up or modification of the attitudes and habits of the single person . Many couples assume marital roles with little or no difficulty . But some young husbands and wives make the change to the situation and relations of marriage with some , considerable , or even great difficulty . Sometimes both a husband and wife report that they have experienced this problem of adjustment to marriage : HUSBAND . In my single life I had one mode of living . In my married life it was quite a radical change . There was quite a bit of adaptation that was necessary . I had less responsibility as a single man and as a lover . Now in marital situations I am a father and husband beside all my other relationships , and I have to act accordingly . WIFE . I have made the necessary mental adjustment from " career woman " to housewife and mother . I have learned at the same time that with the proper attitude , one can find contentment and enjoyment in almost any kind of work , provided the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must distinguish between what adjustments are chargeable to my wife , and what to our marriage . My biggest adjustment was the twentyfour hour a day living with another person . In past years I have kept irregular hours ( amateur radio station , reading , etc . ) . We both still stay up very late . My wife is unable to sleep except fitfully until I come to bed . Of my original resistance to being tied down , not a trace remains . WIFE . The biggest adjustment that I had was with housekeeping . I have always been a home maker , but the daily routine of housework was difficult . I feel I have made a great deal of progress but I still could not compare with my mother as a housekeeper . A HUSBAND . The biggest adjustment was to acquiesce to her devotion to household duties rather than give attention to intellectual pursuits . She does some Somewhat less than half the husbands and wives interviewed state that admit the presthey had to make major adjustments . Nearly every couple -  |p597  reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her women friends , who worry about clothes , and talk nonsense ; always keeping up with Jones ' . I go along with this , but do n't place any importance on it . WIFE . I wish I was n't compelled to devote so much time to domestic duties , or that I could systematize my way of doing things , and have time for other things . I do n't like domestic duties . I object to cooking least of all . I do n't like darning socks , washing clothes , scrubbing woodwork . I think it 's all a waste of time . We have a part-time girl , but she 's pretty inefficient . Husbands are keenly aware at times of the restriction of their freedom resulting from marriage . MAN . Every time I wanted to go someplace like a summer vacation ? it came to me like a jolt ? I could n't go off and do it . It 's been a hell of a hurdle for me . I had always gone up to a camp in Canada but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big sacrifice . MAN . I suppose every man has certain vague feelings that if he were not married and tied down he would take chances at certain jobs that he would not otherwise . One wife expresses what she feels many women give up for marriage . A woman feels she gives up more in a marriage than a man . It is just not wanting to give up some of your personal privacies or little things you used to do that you ca n't do anymore . You have to do more for a home and less for yourself . You feel you would like to have some more time for yourself and you ca n't . That is what makes you feel you give up more . I do n't regret giving them up . Either husband and wife or both , as in the following case , may experience more or less difficulty in establishing the autonomy and primacy of their marriage as over against their ties to their parental home . Sometimes the problem is one of resisting attempts of their mother to control , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have troubles with our mothers . They do n't seem to realize that we are out of their homes . My mother got into my affairs too deep and I had to tell her to mind her own business and my wife has had to do the same thing with her mother . My mother has an idea that no one can take care of me like she can . The husband or wife may find the ties to the parental family stronger than to their own union . This creates a problem of adjustment . WOMAN . My husband , particularly at first , was always running home with whatever troubles or problems we had . It annoyed me . He was always hav-  |p598  ing to consult his mother about things . He used to go ways of acting and thinking , so do n't need much contact with my family or his . MAN . My biggest adjustment was convincing my wife that she was married . It can best be illustrated by a habit of speech which she has only recently corrected . I refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " home . " I think her habit of speech reflected the fact that she still regarded where her father lived as home . She was , and still is , extraordinarily attached to her brother and sister and that was largely responsible for her delay in adjustment . She was not heeding the admonition " to cleave to her husband . " That bond still exists but her brother and sister are now married , so she has three homes to refer to . A question arises at this point . Is it more difficult for the husband or for the wife to become emancipated from the parental family ? Winch and Komarovsky take directly opposite positions on this issue . Winch 's contention is that it is more difficult for the son than for the daughter to achieve independence . This position is consistent with his theory of the nature of interpersonal relationships in the family , and he supports it with some empirical evidence . His hypothesis is that " in middle-class American society there is a tendency for ( a ) the mother to be the preferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred child , and ( c ) for the mother-son relationship to be the strongest of the four parent-child relationships . " 1 In support of this hypothesis he cites his finding that a high degree of courtship behavior of the young man tends to be impeded by the closeness of his relation to his mother while that of the young woman is increased by the degree of her attachment to her father . His interpretation is that males to achieve independence must loosen their attachment to their mother but that females need only to transfer their dependency from father to husband . ' Our case studies indicate that a strong , if not the strongest , influence unfavorable to the emancipation of the adult son and daughter is the mother . In apparent accordance with Winch 's hypothesis of family interpersonal relations , she often makes strenuous effort to continue her dominance over her son and to retain first place in his affection . This behavior , however , might be explained at least in part by the fact that upon the son 's marriage , the mother loses a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she not only keeps a daughter who marries but gains son . Marriage usually means a much sharper break in the mother-son tha footnote'Robert F. Winch , The Modern Family ( Henry Holt and Co. , 1952 , p. 299 ) . 2 Ibid. , p.303.  |p599  in the mother-daughter relation . Often there is no great change in the dependence of the daughter on the mother after her marriage . As will be seen later in the reports of husbands and wives upon their relations with parents-in-law the conflict typically occurs between the wife and her husband 's mother and between the husband and his wife 's mother . Certain social conditions support Komarovsky 's theory of the greater dependence of the daughter than of the son on the family . ' Middle-class girls , in general , are more sheltered than their brothers . Sons to a somewhat greater extent than daughters are living away from home at the time of marriage . In the study of 1000 engaged couples 37.1 of the men and 28.8 of the young women were living outside the parental domicile . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiancee 's 57.9 per cent , were financially independent of their parents . Double the proportion of young women ( 20.2 per cent ) than of young men ( 9.4 per cent ) were entirely dependent on their parents for financial support . The question whether young men or women have the greater difficulty in achieving independence of their parents can not be settled by the existing evidence . The hypothesis adopted by the writers requires further testing : namely , that the interpersonal relations within the family make the break harder on the mother-son relation , but that cultural expectation and the greater freedom accorded sons than daughters encourage his earlier and easier emancipation . AREAS OF ADJUSTMENT Any aspect of the marriage relationship may become an area requiring a major adjustment . Certain of these will be selected for presentation , namely , temperamental compatibility , adaptation of habits , in-laws , friends , recreation , and economic status . Two areas will not be specifically discussed here , because they are treated at length in separate chapters . ' These are adjustments in sexual relations and in planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these adjustments are personality adjustments . Each one reveals one or more aspects of two personalities interacting in marriage . Each area of adjustment is selected to show how it affects the marital relation and how the couple attempts to cope with it . Temperamental compatibility is the expected norm of married life . Couples in the period of their going together , and particularly in engagement , : u -e assumed to have tested how well they are matched in temperament . footnote1 Mirra Komarovsky , " Functional Analysis of Sex Roles , " American Sociological Review , I S , 1950 , pp. 508-16. 2 Chapter 20 , pp. 666-676 , " and Chapter 21 , pp. 706-713.  |p600  After marriage nearly all couples find some mutual adjustments are necessary . These may be more or less easily made as with the following couples . WIFE . We really did all our clashing and adjusting before we were married . We used to have small differences , but we do not now . At a certain time of the month I am much harder to get along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . I do n't think I am very hard for my husband to get along with . HUSBAND . I do n't think we have quarreled since marriage because our temperaments have not irritated each other . I do n't imagine we have averaged a quarrel a year for the five years we have been married . That is phenomenal , I think . I do n't anger easy . I am optimistic and so is my wife . I think both my wife and I are yielding . HUSBAND . Once in a while I used to fly off the handle , but I have not done that in the last three years as much as before . I would say our temperaments have geared in pretty well . Jeannette was easily emotionally upset when we first married but she has gotten over that . I think I am more highly strung . We have pretty much adjusted to each other so that we do n't have many conflicts . WIFE . Generally we just talk things out . We have yet to say that we 've quarreled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weep , but there 's no storming . We both have tempers , but we seldom manifest them toward one another . I get irritable or cross when I 'm sleepy . He 's extremely even-tempered . He angers just when he knows someone has taken him for a ride , but he has n't been angry with me . We 're both stubborn , but when we had an argument , about going out , perhaps , we would both relent at the same time , so neither had to humble himself before the other . Interviews with some married couples show , however , that temperamental clashes occur . Not infrequently , as with the wife in the following case , no adjustment has been reached . The husband does not seem aware of his wife 's feeling . WIFE . My biggest adjustment was getting accustomed to my husband 's ways . I am probably not yet completely adjusted . His temper , for one thing . He loses his temper easily . He gets over it pretty quickly , but I do n't . It sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside . I will never get used to it . He glares and is very angry , and that only tends to make me angry . He apologizes , but then I am mad . Sometimes it takes hours for me to get over it . After he is once over it he is over it for good , but it takes me a long time to get accustomed to it .  |p601  HUSBAND . We 've had some temperamental clashes but no big ones . There has been an occasional argument about the right to suggest or control . A lot of clashes are , I believe , my fault . I think they are due to my stubbornness . It is interesting to ask what are the effects upon the love relation of continuous and unresolved temperamental clashes ? The great majority of couples state that their love has grown or deepened since marriage . But the wife in the above case says , " My love is not greater than before marriage . It is probably more affection than love . " Husbands and wives sometimes report that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a battle royal between them is a way of releasing tensions . They may express the opinion that bringing a difference into the open and fighting it out is better than for one or the other to repress his feelings and build up resentment and antagonism . HUSBAND . My wife and I get along remarkably well on the whole , yet we both have tempers and have fifteen minute spats , then both of us say things we do n't mean . All of this was over in the first few months of marriage . We have temper fits . Florence is fundamentally a very shy and self-conscious little person without self-confidence . With me she discards this shell and these defenses and we 're completely frank . Any time she feels my remarks touch her pride , and when I speak crudely and unpleasantly about what she admires , she 'll react violently . When we run into real clashes of views as well as emotions , then we both get hot and stubborn . Part of the violence that arises is that she wo n't allow herself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her convictions she will fight tooth and nail not to give in to me . She is a very independent soul , and neither of us is subservient to the other . Our clashes may take the form of very intemperate words and even have taken the form of physical violence . WIFE . I think our temperaments complement each other . Charles has a steadying influence on me in ways I need , and there are times when I am forced to act as a check on him . He is a very normal and even-tempered individual . I am inclined to be somewhat more moody and flighty , and each of us long ago learned to make the necessary allowances for the other 's temperament . I do n't know if our friends would agree , because we frequently have violent clashes , but we do this partly because we enjoy it , and it acts as as a safety valve . They usually start over something trivial . For example , we had a violent battle over pulling the kitchen shade . Charles wanted to pull it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had hung new curtains and I was sensitive about it . Charles when aroused has a violent temper . He gets over it quicker and makes the first overtures to reconciliation . We get out of them the excitement that comes from giving away to violence occasionally . I feel on the whole that they are integrating rather than disrupting .  |p602  Certain cases of apparent temperamental incompatibility seem to arise out of differences of opinion which are of cultural origin . The resulting irritations may accumulate and create tension . In these cases incompatibility does not arise so much out of differences in temperament preceding marriage as out of cultural conflicts in the marriage . Examples of this type of reaction which may be termed emotional incompatibility ' are reported in the succeeding interviews . HUSBAND . We get along very well in temperament . I think that has been quite a continuous process . I have been aware less and less of minor irritations . The first year I felt I did more than my share of common duties around the house , but I do n't feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in social activities than my wife . Another silly thing , I did n't own any dress clothes . I got them and wore them , I think , three times in five years . I do n't think of that any more . WIFE . We rubbed each other the wrong way more when we were first married than now . It never was difficult . Things get so they do not seem so important as they did at first . Wayne still reads all the time which drives me crazy when I ca n't get in a word . I know he is irritated when I want to clean things up , or when I want to get something fixed and urge him to help me . It works other ways too when I want to sit and he wants to do something . The only real fight I remember was whether he should get a tuxedo . He said it was silly , a waste of money . I got awfully mad . He does n't like to wear it even now . I 'm less critical of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I used to be . HUSBAND . I think we are both neat , but there are things about the house which my wife insists on . She insists on doing dishes immediately . She is finicky and if these things are not done it irritates her . WIFE . When embarrassed or ill-at-ease , he has his hands to his face but he does n't do that now . Sometimes I feel he is not as friendly as he should be or I would like him to be . I am inclined to be a little too bossy . These instances of adjustment of emotional incompatibility arising out of cultural conflicts are often not so different from the adaptations required by differences in the habits of the couples when beginning married life . Adaptation of habits of husband and wife is a problem , to a greater or less degree , in every marriage . Even if their family backgrounds are similar , some adjustment is almost inevitable . Differences in habits cover a wide range : food preferences , hour of going to bed , sleeping with window open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals , of food . Naturally , Gwen ca n't cook the way mother did . footnote1 See p. 430.  |p603  WIFE . The biggest adjustment was getting acquainted with Fred . I did n't know him long before marriage . I had to get used to having a man around and taking care of him , meals and so on . MAN . Let 's see , the biggest adjustment I had to make was getting used to some of Jane 's habits . For example , her leaving the toothpaste cap off , using my tooth brush , not cleaning my razor after she uses it and so on . They are all petty . They do n't make me hysterical or tear my hair out ; they just annoy me . MAN . My biggest adjustment was getting used to Maude 's habits . She was accustomed to doing things in a certain way and I was used to doing them differently ? such as time of meals , of going to bed . Even now , I hate to go to bed at night and she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habit and in a certain way . Every little thing that Maude does is done habitually . There were preferences in food and methods of preparing it which were entirely different . I had to learn a new diet . We have talked it over , but sometimes it leads to arguments when we are both tired and have things to do ; when we are not flexible and do n't make allowances . In-laws constitute a problem of adjustment or unadjustment or even maladjustment in many marriages . In companionship unions the norm is that the husband and wife establish a new autonomous family with their relationship to each other having priority over their ties to their parents ' families . Occasionally , as in the examples given earlier in this chapter , ' a husband or a wife after marriage will still feel a greater identification with the parental family than with their own . This problem is generally not difficult of solution . The usual problem of adjustment and one often crucial to the success of the marriage is the working out of satisfactory relationships with the parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if any adjustment is necessary . Often the parents of one or both young people may have opposed the union or have manifested disapproval of the bride or groom , but accept the situation and establish good relationships after marriage . HUSBAND . My greatest problem of adjustment was getting used to a new mother , my mother-in-law . She did not care much for me at the beginning but that is all ironed out now . My wife 's mother wanted her daughters to have a career . The difference in religion , also , made a difference to her mother but not to my wife . Her mother treats me as well as my own mother now . She looks out quite a lot for my welfare . In marriage you have to confide as much in your mother-in-law as you do in your mother . footnote1P. 597.  |p604  WIFE . John did n't know why mother objected to him . For one thing , she did not like the difference in our religions . And furthermore , she might have felt he should have had a better job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things began to clear up . They get along wonderfully . His mother has never bothered me . She likes me and I like her and we just get along . I get along very nicely with his father , too . In other cases , like the following one , religious differences may be so wide and so deep as to lead to a complete break with the mother-in  --  law . WIFE . Our relation with his mother has never worked out . That is the thorn in our marriage . I have never been completely happy because of that . The trouble really was religion . They are of one faith , and I belong to a different one . His mother wanted me to accept their religion and be baptised . When we were engaged she asked where we would be married . For three days I had to go over and beg her on bended knees . She finally came to the wedding . She wished us no happiness and did not show us in any way that we mattered . We wondered how my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tear himself away from home and not care . Many times she got angry and we would go and make up . Now we feel it is over for good . He was never much attached to his mother . We have lived with my parents for three years and we have had no argument of any kind , my husband and I. I think they have tried to make up for what he did not get from his family . We never have had any difficulties with my parents . Recently we have talked about how much better it would be if we were alone . My parents are great gadabouts and when they are out , we are at home . If I had it to do over again , I do n't think anyone should live with anyone else 's parents . HUSBAND . We used to go to my mother 's home and visit several times a week , and then an occasion arose when we realized it was more or less superficial cordiality on Mother 's side . We were visiting Mother , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to complain about the marriage and to tell how she disapproved of it , etc . I heard it from my mother-in-law . There was no conflict . We just decided to keep quiet . We had had a feeling that she did not approve . We had kept up the contact for about two years . My wife was disturbed about it but slowly got over it . She shed a few tears ; she was disappointed . She had hoped , but always had the feeling that something was standing between them . My wife agrees that the difference is solely on religious grounds . She is becoming more and more adjusted to this situation . We will continue to live with her parents . If we buy a home of our own , her parents would come along . My father-in-law is old and we would not think of leaving them now . They rent . Her parents are not financially dependent . I would just as soon have them around as not . In a way , they are a help to us.  |p605  The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Usually the attitude to the father-in-law is cordial or neutral . Especially difficult is the situation where the mother-in-law is dominating and seeks to interfere in the affairs of the family . HUSBAND . The biggest adjustment of all was to get along with my motherin-law . If there are any quarrels we have ever had , I think that is where they came from . I have finally got used to letting her think she runs the whole family ; just not to pay any attention to her anymore . All her sons-inlaw and daughters-in-law have had to become adjusted to her domination to keep peace in the family . It bothered me at first but does n't any more . She runs the family so thoroughly that no one would think of disagreeing with her . Thank God we see her only once a year . WIFE . I do n't think there were many adjustments except to keep on an even keel between my family and husband . My family did n't want us to get married when we did . They thought he ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much upset . They get along fairly well at a distance ; when we see each other only a few times a year . WOMAN . My most important adjustment was getting along with in-laws . I have always felt that my husband 's sister thought I was not the right wife for him . In fact , she actually intended to stop the marriage plans . I find it difficult at times to face her outward sweetness and in some cases overlook subtle criticisms . Living with the parents after marriage frequently creates and intensifies conflicts especially when the husband and wife lack adaptability . WIFE . It did n't work out at all , living with my folks , because he used to ignore my parents . He is not nice to them when they come over . This distresses me . My parents try to be pleasant , but he does not reciprocate . So they act accordingly . That is the only thing in our marriage that did n't work out . HUSBAND . The trouble is that I am not very nice to her folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . I like her mother least . We lived in her home for six or seven months after marriage . I do n't know if she was in favor of us getting married . She was always getting into our affairs . She made no objection when we decided to leave . Having a parent in the home frequently creates a problem which is only solved , as in the following case , by the departure of the parent . The fact that the woman 's husband is helping to support his mother remains an unsolved conflict . WIFE . Well , the biggest adjustment was adjusting myself to in-laws . His folks are separated . His dad has lived with us since marriage . He worked  |p606  until last year , but now he kind of gets under my feet . His dad wo n't support the mother , so my husband and his brother have to support her . I 've never been able to adjust myself to sending her the money we could use for the baby or something else . HUSBAND . My father lives with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get along with . My wife has always resented his being here , but only recently has voiced it . That 's why we 're breaking up the combination . He 's leaving the first of the month . He did n't like it . We had a strong session but got through it . The husband may feel it his duty to contribute to the support of one or both of his parents . This financial drain intensifies the wife 's feeling of antagonism . WIFE . Ben 's family is very dependent on him and very unappreciative . They do n't like me very well , as is usual . They are both a temperamental and a financial burden . Ben is the oldest . His sisters are quite young and ca n't help . He does n't seem to think of it as help but as an obligation . It has been hard because we have not been on good terms since marriage . My motherin-law is not very bright or pleasant . She is seldom in accordance with anything I do . I have been constantly criticised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink . HUSBAND . I am getting along swell with Ida 's family . No trouble at all . I spend practically one full day a week there ? usually Sunday . We have a very nice social day together . When my parents object to my wife I say nothing . Certain in-law situations , however , appear very difficult if not impossible of solution . Moving hundreds of miles away lessens but does not seem to remove conflicts . But even when the couple lives near the parents , accommodations may be worked out by a tacit understanding on both sides not to discuss the points of disagreement . MAN . I had to adjust to my mother-in-law . Her ideals are different from mine . All of her values are money values . Money is not a primary value to me . I just put up with her . It has been an adjustment on my mother-in-law 's part , too . She often refrains from expressing herself on money matters when I am around . American society is only beginning to establish conventions which will tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These new social usages will undoubtedly recognize the autonomy of the companionship family and its relative independence from the kinship group in promoting its activities and interests . At the same time , family  |p607  occasions and reunions , like holidays and birthdays , will give opportunity for maintaining ties with parents and relatives . Friends are usually not so critical a problem as in-laws for the newly married couple . For example , friends can . be dropped . Often , as in the following case , the husband gives up the friends of his bachelor days and accepts or tolerates his wife 's friends . HUSBAND . My wife goes out more than I do , and usually her friends are mine . I will say there are friends of hers I do n't like and vice versa . Even if I do n't like them I go with her and visit them . I do n't dislike them or hate them , but I ca n't get along with them . She dislikes the boys I went to school with . I do n't see them anymore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like particularly but he is nice to them . He thinks they are not too intelligent . You know how some women are , they think of nothing but home and clothes and have no intellectual interests . He has dropped several of his friends I did n't approve of since our marriage . He does n't have any now that I disapprove of . The husband may recognize that his boon companions as a single man are not the kind he wishes to introduce to his wife . HUSBAND . The biggest adjustment I had to make was changing over from having quite a number of friends and spending most of my evenings with them in outside recreation and entertainment to spending more time with my wife at home . I was accustomed to staying out later and going out more often than my wife . Then , the people I had been out with , I did n't even care to have my wife meet . The readjustments to friends after marriage are usually made without too much difficulty . HUSBAND . I think that almost all are mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , but usually we get together with our wives . My wife has a couple of friends that she goes out with by herself . Except for this we do n't have separate friends . Our opinions about our friends are usually the same . We have no disagreements about friends . WIFE . We have several groups we belong to . We do almost everything together . Of course , I do have a couple of girl groups and he has a couple of men groups he belongs to . When meetings occur , we go to them but we do n't have one night a week out separately . The majority of our friends are from the church . We have a group of friends outside the church . We belong to the same church . If the husband and wife move to a new place they build up a group of mutual friends from his business or professional associates , from organi-  |p608  zations like the church to which they belong , or from the neighborhood in which they live . WOMAN . I think it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because the husbands of a wife 's girl friends are not likely to be congenial to her husband . Our friends here form a group , pretty much the friends we have in common . I belong to a bridge club where several friends belong . The most satisfactory friends are those whose husbands are congenial . When you go to a new place you are likely to pick up the husband 's business friends and they are likely to be congenial . The recreational activities of husband and wife generally have to be readjusted after marriage . Sometimes their activities become almost identical . HUSBAND . We belong to the same church and our common interests have been built around the church . We belong to several clubs and we play cards . We get together about every three weeks . We play golf occasionally during the summer . We always take our vacation together . We enjoy traveling together . We also enjoy going to the movies . We do not go very often ? about once a month . We have gotten out of the habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment . We enjoy reading . WIFE . We both enjoy church work . Our sports are similar . We enjoy playing golf together and going to the movies occasionally and going out evenings to play pinochle . More often some accommodation is arrived at which permits both joint and separate activities . HUSBAND . My wife likes to be on the go . I prefer to stay at home and read books . That still comes up once in a while . Sometimes one gives in and sometimes the other . There has never been a row about it . It 's been on a compromise basis . WIFE . We both like going to the theatre ; legitimate shows . I like swimming . Felix is not a good swimmer . He likes to play baseball and I do n't . Last summer he played on Sundays a good deal . If he goes early Sunday mornings I sleep and I am not so lonesome . In the spring I went bicycling . Frequently the husband makes the major changes in his recreational interests . WOMAN . He likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up attending although I have never asked him to . He used to be much quieter than I , yet now when we go to a night club he really enjoys himself . It took a while to adjust our recreational differences .  |p609  A major problem of many wives is the desire of the husband to spend an evening with " the boys . " HUSBAND . The last time I went to a poker game I told her a week ahead . She showed that she did not like it . It took her about four days to get over that . I told her once that she ought to be glad that I 'm not a fellow who goes out and gets drunk every night . She just does not like to be left alone . WIFE . What irritates me most is poker parties . I do not like to stay home Saturday nights and they do n't break up until five in the morning . He does n't often do this . They play for so little that it does n't amount to one dollar one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a nice group . The economic circumstances of the young married couple often necessitate a major adjustment in the marriage . In this area are many problems such as unemployment of husband , living within a small income , disposal of income , to save or not to save , and the wife working after marriage . There was a general economic pattern which applied to the majority of couples marrying in 1937 ? 40 . Marriages in many cases were financially possible only if the bride continued to work . Even where her income was not required for necessities it made possible a satisfactory standard of living . Three years after marriage the majority of wives had given up their work . The salary of the husband now equaled or exceeded their combined income when first married . The war years from 1941 on , affected couples differently . For husbands in business and in some professions it spelled economic success . One young man whose business future seemed dubious at the time of engagement was earning over $20,000 a year . But in a few professions with fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our group had to take on another job in order to exist . The unemployment of the husband , especially soon after marriage , is the severest economic crisis met by a few couples . The recession of 1937 ? 38 tended to strike young men in their twenties who had the lowest seniority in their positions . Both husband and wife experience a crisis when he loses his job . Sometimes the husband feels it most , and sometimes the wife . HUSBAND . Our financial problem began soon after marriage . I got jobs occasionally but it was not regular work . I felt bad to stay with my father-inlaw and not contribute as much as I should . Their aid was all willingly given . I helped with the farm work , put up all the hay , milked the cows and helped with anything that had to be done around the farm . WIFE . Roy could not get any work . That was the reason we went in with our folks . He picked up a few odd jobs here and there . He worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a difficult period . I believe it was a little harder on him . I was in with my own folks . While they did everything to make him feel at home , he felt he was imposing and he wanted to support me . Our economic situation is much better now as he has had regular work for over a year . HUSBAND . For three months that year I was out of work . It was at the time the baby came . During that period my wife gave me her complete support . WIFE . He was out of work for about two months . They were the most crazy months of our life . He stood up under the strain fairly well . I do n't think I was ever so worried about anything . He is usually so calm and objective . When a man of that caliber gets out of work it does something to him that is not healthy . The unemployment of the husband often appears , in our cases , to be a harder burden for the wife than for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work stopped . I do n't think it bothered him terribly at first . I am naturally a person to worry and I felt badly about it . Later he got another job that was not steady . He worked five months , then he did n't do anything for eight weeks . He is working now . It was difficult meeting these reverses . They gradually became commonplace . At first it was very hard . I had never been used to anything like that . He does not worry much . He probably felt more than he let on . In my weaker moments I wished I had never married , but I never said that . The question of the disposal of the family income creates problems of adjustment . MAN . I did not have the entire say about the money I earn . I spent my share ? maybe yes and maybe not ? I guess that is one of the big adjustments , to share my money with others . I do n't feel that she is extravagant . She is very careful in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the husband keeps control of the family income but gives the wife an allowance for household expenses . HUSBAND . We have had no disagreements over household finances . Each Thursday she gets an allowance from me for food . I take care of everything else . If she wants more money all she has to do is ask for it . WIFE . We stick pretty much to our budget now . We have not much money to spend . We do n't differ about it except sometimes I am too extravagant but he never criticizes me about this . I would like to have some little source of income of my own .  |p611  MAN . A man is supposed to be the head of his house . As long as she is working I have to concede to her . The spending of money is a condition over which I would like to have control . When she gives up her work she will get so much a week to run the house and I will take care of the rest of the money . Sometimes the husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the responsibility to the wife . WOMAN . When we were first married Tim gave me enough money each week to manage the household expenses , and kept the rest for himself . This bothered me a great deal . Not because he did n't give me enough money , but because I did n't know how much he was making and thus how much he was spending himself . Now he hands over all of his pay and does n't hold out on me . HUSBAND . About the biggest adjustment I had in marriage was in my financial arrangements . Living at home you give some of your money , while after marriage you give all . WIFE . I thought I 'd feel financial privations after I stopped work , but find I like to budget . I do n't miss money I used to spend so foolishly . Since not working I 've learned to do with less and am very , very content . We have a budget and he gets an allowance and every cent is set aside for a particular purpose . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I took over the budget . He could n't bother with it and I like to know where every cent goes . Couples attempt , if possible , to save by buying a home , taking out insurance , or opening a savings account . There are occasional differences where either husband or wife would like to spend less in order to save more . HUSBAND . We budgeted ourselves very strictly when we were first married . Now we are not so strict in budgeting . I like to save money . I would like us to save more than we do . WIFE . Ned likes to save . Before his marriage he used to spend money like water . Since marriage he is different . He likes to put every dollar into the bank . I like to spend money on clothes and give presents to people . I do n't spend too much to annoy him . We have kept a budget and kept within it , sometimes going over it a little . Everybody does that . HUSBAND . My salary did not allow much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not buy anything above my salary . My wife feels that although everything seems nice now , you can never tell what will happen . WIFE . The lack of sufficient resources is what bothers me . Perhaps I put too much weight on it but in our civilization it seems quite important . We try to budget very carefully and take into account most everything . What we  |p612  put away as savings is a disgrace . At the present time Warren is quite disturbed . I think he realizes as well as I the problem of finances . We work on our budget every two weeks together . I wo n't touch the money until he is ready and we can both know definitely what has to be done with it . The majority of the wives continued working after marriage . The emerging pattern for middle-class city girls is to continue to work after marriage . Usually , however , they give up their jobs as secretaries , teachers , technicians , etc. , after one or two years . By then , through their combined earnings the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential home conveniences and facilities which are symbols of status : a car , a radio , an electric refrigerator and washing machine . They have also been able to include in their budget the last in the list of priorities , a baby . Occasionally , a husband insists that his wife give up her work . MAN . Instead of being dependent on one another many couples both work and then they become independent of one another . That 's one thing I made clear before marriage . My wife and I agreed that unless it was absolutely necessary , if I should be ill , for example , I would be the support of the family . My wife was working before her marriage as a secretary but she has n't worked since . MAN . My ideas about the way to live and who should be the leader were the biggest problems of adjustment . I had an independent nature . When we got married I thought I should be the only one bringing in income , and I should or ought to be able to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife ought not to work . Very seldom in our cases does the husband wish the wife to work if she is not disposed to take or keep a job . WOMAN . I feel if I want to work and supplement his salary ? all right , but if I choose not to work that should be something to decide for myself . I feel much better about quarreling about money if I do n't work ? then there is but one source . He wants me to work . Some nonworking wives , as in the following example , feel lost and lonely left in the apartment all day alone while the husband is away at work . WOMAN . When we first married I stopped working and could not get used to staying at home , so I got another job . I could n't get used to having all that time on my hands . I could n't get used to seeing David go to work in the morning and waiting all day to see him come home . We were married in February and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was getting the apartment in order . When that was done I got bored to tears and  |p613  then I got a job and kept working nearly two years . I took a month 's vacation the last year and that eased the stopping . When the wife is not working , a few young couples find it difficult to keep their expenditures within their income . HUSBAND . We occasionally are unhappy that we do n't have enough money but no differences about where to put it . I think June may feel I spend too much money for books . She always says just go ahead and buy . Whether or not she feels it I have not determined . When we are in desperate straits , I feel sometimes inwardly that she spends too much for little things like vases but really I do n't think I should feel that way . I feel she is really very economical . WIFE . We have had to count our pennies pretty closely . When the baby came along that was a little more expense . I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urge that I buy a better piece of clothing than I would . Although we both realize it is better to buy better things in the long run , it is pretty hard for me to spend a lot on one thing . We usually talk it over and decide what to buy . There have been only a few times when we ever have been discouraged , because neither of us think much of money . There have been times when we have had to wait for the next paycheck and think more of it than is wholesome . There have been times when I was hurt because I could not have a new dress and had to spend money for other things . Now I do n't mind it so much and realize that with what we have , we must get along as best we can . We have made that adjustment very well . When I can , I do what I can to help out , such as sewing , canning vegetables , fruits and meats so the food budget will not be so high . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to five years after marriage husbands and wives were asked the question , " Who has made the greater adjustment in mar-riage ? " No clear-cut uniform replies were received . Frequently , each stated the adjustment had been about the same for both . Some husbands and wives , interviewed separately and without opportunity for conference , agreed that the husband made the greater adjustment in marriage . Other couples were in agreement that the wife had to make more adjustments . Sometimes the husband claimed that he had to make more adjustments than his wife , while she asserted the opposite . Occasionally the reply was the other way around , with the husband affirming that it was the wife , while she maintained that it was her husband who had made the greater adjustment . Statements of husbands and wives are quoted to provide examples of the  |p614  differences on this point and also to reveal the reasons why husbands or wives are thought of as making the greater adjustment in the marital relation . ADJUSTMENT THE SAME FOR BOTH Frequently a husband and wife state that neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following case , neither had to do much adjusting . HUSBAND . I 'd say our adjustment to marriage was about even . Julie gets her way about half the time , and I get my way about half the time . WIFE . I do n't know that either has made a greater adjustment . I can see a lot of change in Paul for the better . He 's more affectionate and lets himself go more . But neither has made a huge adjustment . I think I have changed . I did not use to stick up for my own rights before , and now I do . The wife notes that certain changes have taken place in personality interreactions of her husband and herself since marriage . WIFE 'S ADJUSTMENT GREATER The preponderance of replies of husbands and wives in our interviews was that the wives made the greater adjustment in marriage . This finding is in agreement with the theory advanced by Burgess and Cottrell in their study of success or failure in marriage . They point out that in both their study , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scores of husbands have a greater correlation than those of wives with marital success . They offer two explanations . ' First , it may be assumed that the new mores emphasizing equality of the sexes in marriage have not as yet entirely displaced the old attitude that the husband should be dominant . Second , it may be asserted that the trait of dominance is , on the average , more marked in the male , and that of submission in the female . To the extent that this is true , the wife would be disposed to be subordinate and the husband superordinate . To state that at present in American society dominance is in general a male and submission a female trait is not to imply that this difference is necessarily biological . It may , in fact , be social , not in the sense that it is commanded by the mores , but in that it persists in the attitudes arising out of our self-consciousness of sex differences and our conception of what is expected in the behavior of boys and girls , men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintains his routine with no expectation of modifying it in relation to his wife 's wishes . Often she submits without voicing a protest . footnote1 Op. cit. , p. 343.  |p615  HUSBAND . I suppose my wife had to make more adjustments . My routine has not changed since marriage . I get up at the same hour , go to work and come home at night . I still have my way most of the time as I did before we were married , and she has given up more of her privileges . WIFE . I think I have had to make the greater adjustment . When a man gets married , there has to be someone to take care of the house and wait on him . I was used to having my own way . Whenever I wanted something I got it , and it is not exactly that way now . My husband likes to stay home so we stay home an awful lot . Jim is stubborn , I am yielding . He likes to take responsibility and I give in to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take responsibility and I let him worry about it and he enjoys it . He likes someone waiting on him . That is not hard on me . In other cases the wife may put up a contest , although she generally loses . HUSBAND . You expect the man to be dominant in your marriage relationship . I guess I have been . I think possibly she has adjusted more than I. I suppose I am too stubborn to adjust . Since I am a man , I am stronger and usually win out . She thinks I never give in and I think I give in a good share of the time . WIFE . I am quite in agreement that it is the women in America who do the adjusting . I certainly think I 've made more adjustments than my husband . Before marriage I could do as I wanted . You become sort of self-centered if you do n't have to contribute more than we did to the family . The adjustment of having to give in to someone was the greatest . There was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had certain friends say I was quite adjustable to every situation . HUSBAND 'S ADJUSTMENT GREATER In a very few cases the couple agree that the husband makes the major adjustments in marriage . HUSBAND . I probably did have to make the most adjustments in marriage . There were no big adjustments . WIFE . Dan has to make more adjustments in marriage . There are lots of things I ask him to do and he does them . Even when the wife states that the husband has made the greater adjustment , he is quite likely , as in the following case , to report that he is unaware of making any great adjustment . WIFE . Joe has had to make more adjustments in marriage . He lived rather differently from the way I lived or wanted to live . I suppose it was rather  |p616  difficult for him to get used to being a married man . He did n't care so I took the lead ; when something had to be done , I did it . HUSBAND . I do n't know who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made any great adjustments . My wife has been dominant in our marriage , although it has not been at all onerous . DISAGREEMENT ON ADJUSTMENT Occasionally , a husband and wife disagree upon the one that has had to make the greater changes in his way of life in marriage . The husband may assert that the wife has made the greater adjustment but she may insist that it is the other way around . HUSBAND . I think Josephine had to make the greater adjustment , namely , to living with a person like me after living with a family of four boys where there is activity going on all the time . Because I am quiet there is little going on in our home . Then , too , it is hard living with a guy like me because I like things done in a certain way just as I was used to it at home . WIFE . I do n't think I had to make any major adjustment . Gerald and I knew each other a long time before marriage . I think he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get along with . I am moody and have the kind of temper which makes me throw things . I have been pampered , and I think he has done quite well . Quite often the husband maintains that he has made the major adjustment in marriage while the wife contends that she has had to bear more than her share of adjusting . HUSBAND . I made the greater adjustment in getting over the independent way of living . To me it was something to overcome , having always been free and independent and living as I pleased . WIFE . I think maybe I had to make more adjustments in marriage . Being on my own , I do n't think I ever asked anyone what to do . After I was married I had to ask him or at least discuss it with him . Before marriage I had only myself to take care of , after marriage I had to take care of him first and then myself . HUSBAND . I had to submit to more regulations , had to make an economic adjustment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage the greater portion was spent on myself . There was some temperamental adjustment in order to live with another person . There was an increase in tolerance of my wife 's habits and ways of doing things . WIFE . I have settled down a lot since marriage ; more than he has .  |p617  HUSBAND . I think I have made the greater adjustment . Never having had any sisters I had no idea of the paraphernalia that women must have . WIFE . Both of us have had to make adjustments . I think I have had to make the most . I know Roger does n't approve of card-playing as much as I do . I have given up so many things . He has given up several . He sometimes says he gave up more . He gave up his liberty . TIME AND MARITAL ADJUSTMENTS Judson T. Landis 1 studied 409 couples who had been successfully married twenty or more years . He asked husband and wife to state independently the time required to work out adjustments in six areas in marriage . The outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spouses agreed that they had worked out satisfactory adjustments from the beginning of the marriage . Good adjustments from the start were reported by three-fourths of the couples on mutual friends and religious activities , by two-thirds on in-law relationships and social activities , and by a little over one-half on spending family income and sex relations . The next important finding is the per cent of couples where only one member states that adjustments had been satisfactory from the time of marriage . This varies around ten per cent in each area , being highest in sex relations and spending family income and lowest in religious activities and mutual friends . No doubt there is the memory factor operating here since the information was given after twenty years of marriage . Interviews with married couples in the Burgess-Wallin study show that this margin of disagreement upon adjustments of husband and wife may actually represent the true state of the relationship . In every area of adjustment there are cases where the husband reports satisfactory , and the wife unsatisfactory , adjustment . The reverse is also true . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner may not satisfy the other . This corresponds with the findings of Terman and Burgess and Wallin that the marriage happiness and success scores of husbands and wives may vary moderately or even sharply from each other . In the discussion of his findings , Landis seems to imply that time is the effective factor for couples who do not make initially good adjustments . The point needs to be made that the passage of time in itself does nothing . Of course , a spouse having endured an unsatisfactory condition may at last come to accept it . But any emphasis on time as a curative factor may result in a laissez-faire attitude toward dealing with adjustments . Our review of the interviews on adjustments made in the first three to footnote1 Op. cit. , pp. 242-247.  |p618  five years of marriage suggests that adjustments do not happen with the passage of time . They are either made or they are not made . Whether or not they take place is due to a considerable number of circumstances . A central factor seems to be that husband or wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered in detail in the next chapter . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS In this chapter husbands and wives have been given their say about their adjustments in marriage . They have frankly revealed what were their biggest adjustments , the different areas of adjustment , and who had to make the greater adjustment . In a sense what they say speaks for itself . Each reader will draw his own conclusions . He will compare his marital adjustments with those of these couples . If still single , he will have a greater awareness of the meaning of the marital interaction of husband and wife and will be aided in planning his own marriage . Certain major conclusions and implications are briefly stated : 1 ) Adjustment to marriage needs to be distinguished from adjustment of husband and wife to each other . 2 ) There are wide individual differences between couples in adjustment both to marriage and to each other . 3 ) Fully half the husbands and wives report no major problems arising in marriage . These couples , in the main , are those who had made their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in making their adjustments as problems arose . Difficulties in adjustment may appear in any area of the marital relationship , such as temperament , adaptation of habits , sex , in-laws , friends , children , recreation , and economic circumstances . 5 ) Often major problems appear to be present in only one or two aspects of the marriage . Just as often they seem to be chronic in many areas of the union . 6 ) Actually the area in which the adjustment arises may not be significant . The basic problem may be either in the relationship itself or in the decision-making process or in both ( lack of love , absence of sympathetic understanding , desire of one or both to dominate , failure to communicate with each other , inadequate command of techniques of adjustment , etc. ) . 7 ) Either husband or wife may have the greater adjustment to make to marriage , or to each other . 8 ) Wives appear , on the average , to make the greater adjustment in marriage according to their own testimony and that of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wife , is an adventure in adjusting to another personality and in making decisions involving two persons rather than one . 10 ) Marriage , in most cases , means somewhat different adjustment to husband and to wife . The husband assumes the role of the sole or the chief provider ; the wife the role of the homemaker . In many companionship marriages these roles are not clearly differentiated ; the husband may help with household duties while the wife remains gainfully employed . 11 ) In one sense women fit into marriage more easily than men since home , husband , and children tend still to be more central in their interests , except for those to whom a career is more important . The middleclass husband , however , centers his time and attention upon his profession or business . Finally , the concept of adjustment as used in this chapter emphasizes the dynamic aspect of marital interaction . In modern urban society marriage is a process of continual adjustment to the changes taking place within the family and to those which impinge upon it from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these adjustments . An important factor , perhaps the most important , is that of the adaptability of husband and wife which is the subject of the next chapter .  |p620  based on a combination of conditions ascertainable before marriage ? background factors , personality traits , adjustment in engagement and anticipated contingency factors ? show a correlation of .5 . Why is the correlation not higher ? There are at least four possible answers . One is that the items measuring the above premarital factors are not as adequate as they should and could be . A second explanation is that the measures of marital success are not entirely satisfactory . Another is that unforeseen conditions appear after marriage that can not be taken into account during engagement . A fourth is that couples differ in their ability to make marital adjustments and to adjust to changing circumstances in the outside world , and that differences in this ability have not been sufficiently allowed for in the predictions of marital success . All four of these explanations have merit and deserve consideration . In this chapter , however , attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or inability of husband and wife to adjust successfully to each other and to new social situations . This capacity for successful adjustment may be termed adaptability . Adaptability is , of course , an aspect of personality , and as such its consideration belongs with the discussion of personality factors in marital success . ' Indeed , many of the characteristics reported there to be predictive of marital success are probably so because to some extent they are indexes of adaptability . None the less , we consider it advisable to devote a separate chapter to the factor of adaptability in order to call attention to what we believe to be a highly significant factor in the success of the marriage relationship . Extracts from an interview will be presented to give a picture of the presence of unadaptability and its effects upon a marriage . The following footnote See pp. 523-536.  |p621  statements by a married couple provide clues to the reasons for the husband 's lack of adaptability : HUSBAND . My biggest adjustment in marriage was taking responsibility . It still is hard . I found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to forget a few ideas . My wife 's personality is very pleasing . Her temperament is even . She is very level-headed , understanding . I do n't think she has got a temper . She does n't like my temper . I do n't think there is anything besides my temper that irritates her . I believe I had to make the greater adjustment in marriage . I was sort of irresponsible , wild , reckless , and I had to stop all those things and settle down . I am still kind of reckless . If you ever played cards with me you would see that . That prevents my winning . I lose $7 , $8 , or $10 , rarely more . Nellie gets sort of irritated . I do n't think demonstration of affection means a thing . Nellie seems to like it . I would say I take the lead in our marriage . I demand more things , speaking generally . Usually , if I want to do something she gives in to me . I was out of work most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I was and still am pretty independent about the type of job I would work at . It was pretty hard on our marriage . She felt very irritated . It did n't bother me as much . WIFE . Jim has a bad temper and I do n't think I have a bad temper . His temper is aggravating . I think he is stubborn . I think he was spoiled when he was a boy . I have to give in most of the time in order to keep peace in the family . It 's hard at times . If things do n't go my way I get nervous . I am more yielding than stubborn . He likes to play cards and I had to adjust myself to that . I learned to play cards . I do n't like them . There were times when he was not making a living for me . I have gone through a certain period of hardship . That was a little bit nerve-racking . I did n't call him down unless I felt he had done something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is the type of man that will not work for small money . I would like to make my husband more thoughtful of me , or , rather , have him consider me more than he does . His family has quite a little influence over him that I would like to break . He is very much attached to his family . As far as getting together and going to places , they influence him . I think demonstration of affection is very important . I do n't get as much as I would like . I do n't think it is important to Jim . This marriage is husband-dominated . It conforms to the traditional American pattern of the husband making decisions and the wife submitting . The husband realizes that he is carrying on a family tradition  |p622  reinforced by his mother 's injunction . The interview as a whole suggests that he may have a personality need for dominance which is not satisfied in his work . The husband on entering marriage was loath to give up the attitudes of independence and irresponsibility of the single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustments to marriage than the wife . But actually he has tried to adjust to marriage rather than to his wife . His nonadaptability results in part from the conflict between the roles of the married and the single man . The failure of the husband to adjust to his wife and to marriage evidently stems from a number of sources . Among these are : 1 ) His lack of insight into his wife 's attitudes indicates his incapacity for empathy , at least in relation to her . By " lacking empathy " is meant that he does not see the marriage , his wife , and himself from her point of view . 2 ) Another factor making for difficulty of adjustment is the husband 's lack of flexibility . This is apparent in his difficulty in accepting the responsibilities of marriage and his unwillingness to take a job he did not like while waiting for a more suitable one . His wife terms him " stubborn , " a common-sense term for lack of flexibility in interpersonal relations . Further evidence of unadaptability is the persistence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He admits having given up certain ideas . It is evident , however , that he believes the husband should dominate and that the wife should accept his decisions . These attitudes are culturally conditioned , and may be also an expression of his determination ? developed in childhood ? to have his own way . 3 ) The husband is not strongly motivated to make a success of marriage . He still longs for the freedom and irresponsibility of a bachelor 's life . He seems also to feel more loyalty to his parents ' family than to the one of which he is head . Even when he perceives his wife 's dissatisfaction ( as in his lack of demonstration of affection ) he is not disposed to change his behavior. 4 ) Neither the husband nor the wife has had preparation for marriage other than the example of their parents ' marriages . They do not have sufficient knowledge of appropriate responses to aid them in solving the problems of their marital relationship .. Although the wife submits , there are indications that she may become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of frustration and represents lack of adjustment . It is a futile way of trying to maintain her self-respect and her conception of the role of a wife . But it also signifies her unadaptability to the situation . In modern marriage adaptability is of increasing importance . All the  |p623  social and economic changes associated with urbanization lead to a high degree of differentiation between individuals in personality and in attitudes and values . ' This means that persons are constantly being required to adjust to others who differ from themselves in many essential respects . At the same time , the growing emphasis on companionship and personal happiness in marriage is accentuating the demand for husband-wife compatibility in temperament , interests , and ideas . Moreover , society and the family are experiencing the impact of a more rapid tempo of change , which in turn requires greater capacity for adaptability in husband and wife . In a static social order with stable socio-economic conditions , integration of family members in terms of predetermined familial roles is assigned the highest social value . In a dynamic society such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been given the subject of adaptability by social scientists our discussion can make little reference to research findings . Our concept of adaptability , therefore , is necessarily a tentative formulation , to be tested by research , of the following questions : 1 ) What is adaptability and the conditions favorable for its expression ? 2 ) What is the role of adaptability in successful marriage ? 3 ) Can adaptability be increased ? 4 ) What is the relation of adaptability to the making of decisions by husband and wife ? 5 ) How is adaptability to be measured ? WHAT IS ADAPTABILITY ? Adaptability may be defined as the capacity of the person to change his roles , his attitudes , and his behavior in order to adjust to those of other persons or to a new or modified situation . In marriage , adaptability enables husband and wife to adjust successfully despite the conflicting facets of their personalities which reveal themselves in the exigencies of marriage , and to cope with changes in the social situations which impinge upon and affect their roles as husband and wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior , since the latter may simply denote acceptance of the lead of others , or of the existing situation without any constructive action to make appropriate modifications . Four conditions of adaptability need to be distinguished . These are empathy , flexibility , command of appropriate attitudes and roles , and the footnote See p. 16.  |p624  motivation to adjust . These conditions of adaptability will be defined and discussed . Then the consideration of the role of adaptability in successful marriage and the possibilities of increasing adaptability and its measurement will be presented . EMPATHY Empathy or " understanding " of others is used here to refer to the ability to recognize and appreciate the motivation of their actions . The wife who correctly attributes her husband 's display of temper at dinner to the tensions and frustrations of his business day , rather than to dissatisfaction with her cooking , recognizes the reason for his behavior . Her understanding is complete if , in addition , she " appreciates " his feeling , i.e. , if she can project herself into his situation and feel as he does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously is what is meant by empathy . It is the ability to identify oneself with another , and at the same time to differentiate oneself from him . A second example may be helpful . The young husband finds that his wife withdraws from his sexual advances . He may incorrectly interpret this action as evidence of lack of affection . If he can empathize with her he will perceive the behavior as the resultant of her upbringing and appreciate how she feels . Empathy differs from sympathy , which is the tendency to put oneself in another 's place . Sympathy is a more spontaneous and less reflective reaction to the behavior of another person than is empathy . And sympathy may hinder understanding insofar as the individual interprets the responses of other individuals in terms of how he would feel and act in their place . The more marked the dissimilarity between persons the less likely they are to understand one another by sympathy . In empathy , however , one takes the role of the other , and , in so doing , interprets his behavior in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of one 's own . The young child learns to understand the adults about him in considerable part by a rudimentary form of empathy , and as he grows older empathy ? in a more developed form ? continues to be used as a mode of understanding people . The young child often plays the role of various persons without any sharp sense of self-differentiation . It is only with the gradual emergence of a conception of self that the child can take the role of another and at the same time differentiate himself from the other as adults do in empathy .  |p625  DEGREES OF EMPATHY Individual differences in the ability to empathize may be thought of as ranging on a continuum from little or none to the highest degree of understanding . A relatively low degree of empathy is manifested by the categorization of one 's spouse by a popular stereotype . Familiar examples are the husband 's exclamation , " that is just like a woman , " or a wife 's ejaculation , " men behave that way . " These explanations require little or no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilitate adapting one 's behavior to that of the other . A husband 's rationalization of his wife 's behavior as that of the popular conception of the overindulged only child enables him to make adjustments to it : HUSBAND . Irene has had to make quite a few adjustments . She was an only child , and while she thinks she had not been spoiled , she has had nearly everything her own way . She has not had to share things except with her parents , and things you share with parents are not exactly the same as what you share with people your own age . I have tried to take this into account in making adjustments . A moderately high degree of empathy markedly facilitates marital adjustments . HUSBAND . After we were married a little over a year and expecting a baby , I resigned my position over a matter which I now realize was trivial . For three months I was looking for work and finding none . During all that time my wife never by word or gesture indicated that I was to blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my difficulty in finding another . I will never forget the way she stood by me then . Empathy , if complete , results in sympathetic understanding . When this takes place many of the occasions for conflict vanish . If both the husband and the wife are empathetic there is a " blending of personalities . " A wife describes this as a process of " emotionally growing together . " WIFE . There is some emotional adjustment to be made in every marriage , I think , blending your personalities and learning all his little faults and being able to accept " all the rude awakenings . " Emotionally growing together ? partly an acceptance of his habits which have always been in his family and not in yours . Empathy , as in this case , results in the married couple 's realistic rather than an idealistic conception of each other . The wife perceives the husband as he is , but because of sympathetic understanding accepts rather than re-  |p626  jects him . Unlike many wives , she does not attempt to reform , but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . FREEDOM OF COMMUNICATION , CONFIDING , AND DISCUSSION The degree of empathy achieved in marriage depends upon the intimacy of the husband-wife relationship . Interviews disclose that the understanding of the attitudes and motives of each other develops through communication , confiding , and discussion . Frankness of communication between husband and wife prevents the development of serious conflicts and misunderstandings . WOMAN . Whatever my husband dislikes in me he tells me , and I tell him II too . We both have a great sense of reasoning . I guess that is why we do n't quarrel . WOMAN . My husband has a very understanding nature . Sometimes when I get mad , he will get down to the bottom of the trouble and analyze it . He will not let it go that I am moody but will find out why . Usually he finds a reason , and he tells me how foolish it is to be moody over something so petty . Then I laugh it off with him . One husband advocates discussion of all questions as the key for marital success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't act that way . " My slogan for success of marriage is to discuss things . I 've always insisted , " There is nothing that ca n't be discussed . " Although all normal adults are capable of empathy in some degree , there are undoubtedly marked individual differences . These differences are , in all likelihood , largely a function of variation in early experiences in the family and the play group . The capacity probably has its greatest development in childhood . But its growth may continue with the multiplication of the individual 's interpersonal relationships . FLEXIBILITY Flexibility may be defined as the ability to vary one 's responses in interpersonal relations ; a capacity which is partly psychogenic . By " psychogenic " is meant that it is developed primarily in the early years of life in the relations of the individual with his parents , brothers , and sisters . Flexibility is an essential condition for adaptability . We may understand people and know what to do to get along with them , but we can not adapt to them unless that understanding and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The extent to which this is possible depends on the flexi-  |p627  bility of our personalities . Lack of flexibility implies rigid and stereotyped response , which beyond a given point incapacitates the individual for social life as in the case of the neurotic , psychotic , or feeble-minded . Persons who are tactful , diplomatic , or popular with a great variety of people probably have great flexibility of personality . Persons whose environment and experience have been highly homogeneous , standardized , and stable are probably low in flexibility . They have not been exposed to a sufficient variety of situations and relationships to acquire and appreciate any considerable skill in changing roles and attitudes . These reflections indicate that flexibility and its opposite , rigidity of personality , are guided by two main influences , psychogenic and cultural . A good example for discussion is the so-called trait of " stubbornness , " the common-sense term for rigidity of personality . What is called stubbornness may be due , of course , to attitudes and beliefs quite as much as to any inborn or psychogenic trait . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his marriage succeed has enabled him to control his temper and to become more flexible in the interaction of marital life . WIFE . The biggest adjustment was perhaps personality adjustment . I am kind of slow and easy-going . My husband has a very quick temper and is inconsiderate of the next person 's feelings . Those traits are slowly disappearing in his character , and , of course , that makes me a lot happier . HUSBAND . The biggest adjustment I made was to give in to the wishes of another person more than I ever had to do before . I had to do that in order to get along with the other . If one has a stubborn nature he has to do that to make a go of it . I think I was stubborn at one time . I am not so much now . I am getting over it . Another reference to " stubbornness " attributes it to one 's nature : to deep-seated convictions and biological or social inheritance . WOMAN . I am afraid I am stubborn like my parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have him any other way . MAN . I had an independent nature . When we got married I thought I would be the only one bringing in income . I had a stubborn feeling that my wife ought not to work . MAN . We differ as to the nature and type of activities outside the home . Before the baby was born , my wife spent a lot of time shopping and playing bridge . I thought she should be interested in some social work and more reading . A lot of the clashes are , I believe , my fault . I think they are due to my stubbornness .  |p628  These cases seem to indicate that so-called " stubbornness " is seldom , if ever , completely genic or psychogenic . It is rather a manifestation of the conflicting expectations that husbands and wives bring to marriage . Their divergent conceptions of roles create problems which are often insuperable of solution by nonadaptive partners . They may strain , if not break , the relation of even the most adaptable spouses . The crux of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the role , as in the social pressure which supports it , and in the emotional meaning which it may have in terms of forgotten experiences , or as compensations for failure in other areas of life . TRADITIONAL VERSUS MODERN ROLES OF HUSBAND AND WIFE In the Burgess-Wallin study of engaged and married couples , the majority of young men and women subscribed , in general , to the democratic conception of the marriage relation . But there were exceptions , as in the following case . I 'm naturally a " Little Caesar . " I want my way all the time . Mother has the " old " idea of a husband 's role in the home . She thinks the husband should be the lord and master of the household . I usually get my way by insisting strongly . The " Little Caesar " role of this husband is an illustration of the attitude of those husbands who still assert their claim to the dominating role in family decisions . A large group of other husbands wish to be considered the head of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the relation . One young man in this study asked his fiancee to promise that he would have the deciding right on important questions which would arise in their marriage . Burgess and Cottrell point out that " the new mores emphasizing the equality of the sexes in marriage have not as yet entirely displaced the old attitude that the husband should be dominant . " I Pearl Buck , ' Margaret Mead , ' and other observers of the relations of the sexes in this country point out that in many subtle , and in some quite overt , ways the boy and man realize and assert their superiority and dominance . IN-LAW INFLUENCE footnoteThe parents of the groom and the bride exert an influence by example and by precept upon the interplay of roles between husband and wife . This Op. cit. , p. 343. 2 Pearl S. Buck , American Unity and Asia ( New York : John Day and Co. , 1942 ) , Chapter 9. 2 Margaret Mead , Male and Female ( New York : William Morrow and Co. , 1949 ) .  |p629  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whose father ruled the household and whose mother enjoined upon her son to be " head and master in the family . " A similar case but with a different outcome is the following : WOMAN . When I married , my mother advised me to do what Torn wanted and not to question anything he did . Tom 's parents , as I found out later , told him that since I was three years older , he should take charge and not let me boss him . Well , it just did n't work out . He did not have good judgment . When we moved to another state he could not fall back for advice from his folks . I stood it for nearly two years , then we had a flare-up . After that we talked it over and I got him to agree to talk things over with me before rushing into a decision . This was hard for him to do at first . As he saw that things worked out better , he came to appreciate my point of view and the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tenacity with which a husband or wife holds to a given role may only partially be due to rigidity of personality , traditional pattern or social pressure . It also may be firmly rooted in the emotional life of the person . Particularly , it may represent compensation for failure in an occupation , inferiority feelings , or other kinds of personal and social inadequacy . The husband who holds a subordinate position in a business office , particularly if he is ordered around by his superior , may get compensation by ordering and forbidding behavior with his wife and children . A husband may feel that his wife outshines him in social life . Instead of being proud of her , he may restrict their outside activities by various rationalizations in terms of its taking too much time or money , or that he needs to relax at home in the evening , or that the baby should have more attention and care . CHILDHOOD CONDITIONING The role pattern impressed on the person by his parents is generally both an emotional and a cultural conditioning . In cases where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' e .. : - : ? ndingly overdependent , the role pattern may be deeply emotionally conditioned:j , The overly dependent youth may be unable to break his attachment with his mother in order to marry , or if he marries , is too much dominated by his mother to establish a satisfactory adult relation with his wife . In a similar way the wife may be unsuccessful in her adjustment with her husband because of overdependence on her father or mother . The expectation by the husband that the wife take the home role ex-  |p630  elusively is often emotionally motivated . A wife speaks of the constant critical attitude of her husband to her housekeeping as a point of tension . His mother was a perfectionist as a housekeeper . I do the best I can . When he comes home he will rub his white handkerchief over the top of the piano . , He will not believe me when I tell him that I dusted the room only that morning , and that this city is notorious for its smoke and dirt . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unadaptability of a wife in a specific situation . Both members of the couple were intelligent and solved the problem before it developed into a tension . The husband tells the story . Our income was small and Jane and I agreed that we should carefully budget our expenditures . It was my surprise to find that at the end of the first month , when I suggested that we go over our finances , she reacted emotionally and seemed to resent any discussion of the matter . At first I was bewildered and perplexed because this behavior was so different from the way she had met other questions . I had minored in psychology in college and learned about childhood conditioning of emotional responses . That gave me the clue . She told me then that her parents had great difficulty in making ends meet on her father 's small salar.y . The end of each month resulted in an emotional scene , with her father holding his wife responsible for the care with which the money was spent and condemning her for her extravagance , while her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any of his charges . My wife was often present at these emotionally charged sessions and identified herself with her mother . After we talked it over , my wife obtained an understanding of the way in which this background affected her present attitude . We agreed that we must have full trust in each other 's sincerity , and that we could and would work together to make the necessary economies to balance our budget . MOTIVATION TO ADAPT Adapting one 's behavior to that of other persons is by no means a painless operation . Requiring as it does a change of attitude , roles , or behavior , adapting takes effort and persistence . The less flexible the person , the greater the demand made upon him when he attempts to adapt . This means that he must be adequately motivated . There are certainly many marriages of short duration which might have survived had husband or wife or both tried to adapt to one another . Their failure to attempt it may be attributed in part to a lack of motivation to keep the marriage intact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source in a number of factors . Only five of the most important will be discussed . These are ( 1 )  |p631  love , ( 2 ) fluid situations , ( 3 ) crises , ( 4 ) intimate group pressure , and ( 5 ) determination to succeed in marriage . LOVE One aspect of the love of husband and wife is a state of rapport , or their mutual responsiveness to the attitudes and wishes of the other . In an earlier chapter the relation of love to identification was analyzed . ' Married couples in the Burgess-Wallin study usually reported that their love had deepened and grown stronger after marriage . One hypothesis of the writers is that , other things being equal , the more in love engaged and married couples are , the greater their adaptability because the greater is their motivation to adapt . Statistical evidence on this point is available from the study of 1000 engaged couples . The correlation of love with adaptability in engagement was .31 and with the engagement adjustment score .51.2 Adaptability was roughly measured by degree of confiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate confided in respondent . A second hypothesis is that the member of the engaged or married couple who is more in love is the more adaptable . This conclusion appears to be corroborated by interview data . It has not , however , been subjected to statistical test and , therefore , requires further research . FLUID SITUATIONS Favorable to adaptability is a fluid situation . An example of this is courtship , a time when the lovers tend to be especially sensitive to one another 's attitudes and expectations and are disposed to govern their behavior accordingly . In the courtship and engagement periods , therefore , the two young people are capable of influencing one another 's attitudes and behavior . So far as either one is interested in reforming the other , the opportunity is greater before than after marriage . New and different situations tend to be fluid because they point up the fact that a person 's stock of attitudes and behavior is not applicable , and that change or modification is required . The pregnancy of the wife creates a new and fluid situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize that they are entering upon a new stage in the marital relationship . They are often drawn closer together by the impending event . The husband is solicitous about his wife 's health and welfare . Lying-in hospitals are taking advantage of this fluid situation , so fa- footnote See pp. 453-456. 2 Based on a random sample of 200 cases who subsequently married .  |p632  vorable to the strengthening of the motive to adapt . They are offering courses on care of the baby not only to expectant mothers , but also to expectant fathers . In this way husbands are being motivated to be prepared to assume what has been traditionally a woman 's role . What is more , fathers are being trained to be as competent as mothers in caring for the baby . CRISES Crisis situations may motivate adaptive behavior by focusing attention on values which are threatened unless the appropriate change or modification is made . A husband with fixed conceptions about a wife 's place being in the home will not , under normal conditions , adapt his ideas to her desire to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a depression takes away his job and threatens the security of the family . A crisis in an engagement or marriage may force one or both couple members to adapt by suddenly confronting them with what they stand to lose if they fail to adjust . A woman who reported her marriage as extraordinarily happy gave this account of a crisis in the engagement period : Tom , my husband , has a terrible temper . He will explode over the smallest trifle . One time before our marriage I thought it over and decided I could not endure a married life of quarrels and recriminations . I wrote him that everything was off between us and returned the ring . That night I lay awake and found I loved him too much to break with him . I resolved to go into marriage with my eyes wide open and make all the necessary adjustments . It has not been easy , I assure you , but I regard my marriage as very happy . I try to do nothing to irritate him , but he still explodes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how a man can swear . I never make any suggestions unless he asks for them . If they work , I never remind him that I made them . In some cases couples break their engagement or marriage only to resume it later . Presumably what happens in these instances is that the crisis of breaking the relationship redefines the value and the desirability of the mate . This redefinition provides the stimulus for one or both persons to resume the relationship with determination to make the necessary changes in attitude or behavior . ' INTIMATE GROUP PRESSURE The influence of friends upon married couples may increase or diminish their motivation to adapt . An intimate group of young married people may footnoteSec p. 296.  |p633  exert tremendous pressure upon its members . In the following example the husband describes the effect of a group of married women upon his wife 's motivation for a child . I very much wanted a baby , but my wife was not at all interested . Soon , however , she found herself the only childless woman in her bridge club . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their babies ' diets , regimen , and so forth . It was not long until she , too , wanted a child . A group of married couples may decrease the will of one of its members to adapt and thus break up an adjustment which seems to be working out satisfactorily . In this instance the husband was motivated to assume the traditional dominating role . WIFE . I was more of an executive type than Jim so it was just natural for me to take the lead in making our decisions . I must have been too obvious about it because the fellows in our group of married couples began to make jokes about him being " henpecked " and about me " wearing the pants . " Jim 's reaction was terrific . He insisted on doing all the deciding . He took to ordering me about in the group . The worst thing about it was that his judgment was not as good as mine . Our family finances have suffered as a consequence . Worst of all , our happy relation has become unhappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition of male supremacy is perpetuated in spite of the article in our American creed about the equality of the sexes and of democracy as the basis for the modern family . It also shows the reversal of the motivation to adapt as the husband attempts to realize the conception of himself as dominant in the marriage . The determination of husband and wife to make a success of marriage increases their motivation to adapt . This attitude , obviously , is the result of a combination of external and internal factors . The external influences include the state of public opinion toward divorce ; pressure of intimate groups ( family , friends , etc. ) ; the sanction of the church and its position on divorce and the remarriage of divorced persons ; and the effect of separation and divorce upon the social position and economic status of the person . The impact of all these so-called " external " forces are exerting less and less force than in the past . More and more their influence corresponds to the degree that they are internalized in the person . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member to the extent that he is religious and accepts the ideal of the inviolability of marital vows . IndiWILL TO SUCCEED IN MARRIAGE  |p634  vidual differences in sensitivity to attitudes of family , friends , and the public are probably more significant in the decision to seek a divorce than the actual force of these attitudes . A major effect of the weakening of community control over the marriage relationship has been the reduction in motivation of husbands and wives to adapt to each other . If divorce is no disgrace and remarriage is easy , the pressure to adapt is not great . If it is true , as our evidence indicates , that the wife adapts more than the husband in modern marriage the explanation , at least in part , may be not that women are more flexible , but rather that they continue to have more of a stake in an unbroken marriage . Certain other attitudes of husband and wife maintain and , indeed , may strengthen the marital relation . The will to make the marriage succeed is increased with the degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and the children 's opposition to an impending separation of father and mother . The father faces the fact that divorce involves virtual separation from his children as well as from his wife . Consequently , the breakup of the home tends to be delayed as long as there remains any prospect of continuing the marital relation or until the children reach adulthood . Usually the determination to succeed is not directly related to the contingency of separation and divorce . Rather , it is generally a considered reaction of husband or wife or both to the obstacles to the smooth functioning of the marriage , or to conflicts inconsistent with their ideal of married life . This attitude may find expression in the injunction of action to preserve peace and harmony . MAN . Both of us are working . We both manage the household tasks . I do n't feel like helping , but I must to preserve harmony . COMMAND OF APPROPRIATE RESPONSES Understanding correctly orients the individual to the behavior of another . But to adjust to it successfully , the husband or wife must possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the first example cited under " empathy , " the wife 's understanding may correctly orient her to the husband 's behavior . This increases the chances that she will be able to adapt to his display of temper , but she can do so only if she has command of the responses appropriate to his behavior . If she has learned that his temper runs its course if not recharged by a counter display of temper , and can restrain herself accordingly , she commands the appropriate response and can adapt to the situation .  |p635  Similarly , in our second hypothetical case on empathy , understanding on the part of the husband does not insure that he will be able to adapt to the bride 's withdrawal from his embrace . He must also know what to do and be able to do it if he is to avoid strengthening her fears , and possibly alienating her affection . Both illustrations stress the fact that adaptability involves understanding , knowledge of responses appropriate to the specific situations and also the ability ? which includes what we have called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's behavior . Knowledge of responses which make possible integration of one 's behavior with that of another is possessed by all of us in various amounts . It is a product of intelligence and of experience with other human beings . From childhood on we learn in the course of social life the right thing to do in reacting to persons with whom we wish to maintain amicable relations or whose behavior we wish to influence . Observant children acquire a knowledge of the responses appropriate to the personalities and moods and actions of their parents . Grownups likewise learn what things do or do not " rub others the wrong way . " This learning of appropriate responses is a major part of the process of adjusting successfully to another person . The other part is the assimilation of these responses to one 's own behavior patterns . The , extent to which individuals are able to accomplish this is dependent in part on the flexibility of their personality . These conditions of adaptability are not independent of each other . In fact , they are interrelated . Empathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to empathize . Empathy and flexibility promote the motivation to adapt to one 's mate . If the person has the will to adjust to his mate he may be able to decrease the rigidity of his point of view and increase his ability to understand his spouse . Empathy , flexibility , and the motivation to adapt all contribute to the ability of a person ; help him to become competent in interpersonal relations . Also a command of appropriate responses in marriage should include an understanding of how to develop skill in empathy , to become more flexible in reacting to others , and to increase the motivation to be adaptable in marriage . The remainder of the chapter will take up ( 1 ) the role of adaptability in successful marriage , ( 2 ) adaptability and decision-making , and ( 3 ) the measurement of adaptability . THE ROLE OF ADAPTABILITY IN SUCCESSFUL MARRIAGE It would seem self-evident that adaptability on the part of both husband and wife should increase the probability of marital success . American culture is so heterogeneous and complex that a couple may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , attitudes , and expectations due to differences in their backgrounds . Their personalities may clash in certain respects and they may differ in many important conceptions of marriage and family life . They may both , for example , have a tendency to be dominating . One or both , then , must be capable of adapting or the relationship will be beset by conflict . They may differ in their sense of money values , the husband watching pennies , and the wife being unconcerned about dollars . Such a discrepancy obviously can be a constant basis of friction . Again , adaptability is the solution . The couple must try to understand each other 's behavior ; try to devise a plan which offers satisfaction to the needs of both and modify their actions in accordance with the plan . INTEGRATION AND INTERCHANGEABILITY OF ROLES Husband and wife may be able to integrate their conception of the roles of husband and wife if these conceptions are not compatible . If both can not adapt , the wife who categorically rejects her husband 's patriarchal conception of the subordinacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior by satisfying the form , but not the substance , of his expectations . ONE-SIDED ADAPTABILITY Other things being equal , the chances of a successful marriage are greatest if both spouses are highly adaptable . The chances are fewer if only one is so and least , when both are capable of little adaptability . Sometimes the semblance of harmony is achieved in marriage as a consequence of the unadaptability of one of the spouses . The rigid , and hence unadaptable , person may unwittingly compel or deliberately try to force the other partner to do the adapting . When such a person is successful , or apparently so , he is likely to create resentment and hostility toward himself . At best he may achieve a temporary , superficial , and deceptive solution of the problem . Tom , the husband with the explosive temper in the marriage cited earlier , may be a case in point , although as of the present it does not appear so . He is presumably unaware of the fact that his wife is being compelled to adapt to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for him . A weakening of her love would reduce her motivation to adapt and threaten the marriage . To preserve it he would have to modify his behavior . Adaptation on the part of one or both members of a couple is in general most likely to achieve its end if both are aware of its necessity and are trying to do something about it . In certain instances , however , one member .  |p637  may on the face of it adapt and thereby satisfy the other , but , in effect , not be required to make any vital or difficult change in his own behavior . ADAPTABILITY IN MARITAL ROLES AND MARITAL SUCCESS Lu compared findings from three studies on the relation of marital roles to success in marriage . These statistical data indicate the association between marital happiness and adaptability as measured by neither husband nor wife taking the dominant role , but rather by both assuming the equalitarian role . The data in Table 89 show that either husband or wife in the dominant role tends to be correlated with low marital success scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hills investigated adaptability and other factors in the adjustment of 135 Iowa families to two wartime experiences . These were the separation of husband and wife resulting from his entrance into the armed forces and their reunion upon his release from the service . Hill adapted Cavan 's scale of family adaptability 2 for use in his study . footnote1 Reuben Hill , Families Under Stress ( New York : Harper and Brothers , 1949 ) . 2 See scale in Ernest W. Burgess and Harvey J. Locke , op. cit. , pp. 781-84.  |p638  His adaptability score was based on answers to items on degree of nonmaterialistic philosophy , pattern of family control and flow of authority , willingness to shift roles , degree of responsibility assumed in the family , and previous experience in meeting crises . He also devised questions on adjustment both to separation and to reunion . Family adaptability was one of several factors which he related to the separation and reunion experiences . He found that family adaptability , days of furlough and visits , marital adjustment , and wife 's participation in social activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interestingly , he discovered that family integration exerted no independent relation to adjustment to separation when the other factors were held constant . This finding is consistent with the results of the restudy of Angell 's cases of adjustment of families to the depression . ' Adaptability alone was found to predict adjustment quite as well as adaptability and integration combined . Hill concludes that while family integration was important to successful reunion , " separation required adaptability and high personal adequacy of wife ? a wife who could take it . ' " 2 Finally , Hill reports two correlations between family adaptability and two measures of marital success . He found the Pearsonian coefficient of correlation of .42 with the wife 's marital happiness scores and .54 with marital adjustment scores . SWEDISH DATA ON ADAPTABILITY AND MARITAL SUCCESS In conclusion , it is interesting to point out that the Swedish data gathered by Karlsson confirm the findings on the relation of adaptability to success in marriage . His limited adaptability index is composed of items which he and his associates are agreed are indicative of adaptability . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " gives in " in arguments , gets over anger quickly , gets easily into conversation with new acquaintances , understanding mate 's wishes , and understanding mate 's feelings . The absence of certain characteristics was assumed to indicate adaptability : dominating , gets angry easily , and expects others to accept his opinion . Karlsson secured correlations of both self-ratings and ratings of the mate on these traits with his index of marital satisfaction . The ratings of the mate proved to be more significantly associated with marital success footnotel Unpublished study . 2 Op. cit. , p. 204.  |p639  than were self-ratings . Karlsson reports " the self-ratings on limited adaptability correlated .23 for husbands and .31 for wives with marital satisfaction and ratings of mate correlated .64 for men and .67 for women . ' The evidence of the , three studies reported by Lu , Hill , and Karlsson indicates the desirability of giving more attention to the role of adaptability in marital success . CAN ADAPTABILITY BE INCREASED ? If adaptability is important for success in modern marriage , a final question of practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic which can be developed and , if so , how and to what extent ? Our present limited knowledge of the nature of adaptability and the conditions of its development permits only a tentative answering of the question . This can best be done by considering the different conditions of adaptability . Empathy is probably in some degree psychogenic , developing in the interaction of the self with other selves in the early months and years of life . In part it may be genic , determined by inheritance . In either case it is probably not easily modifiable by the time adulthood has been reached . Within limits , however , it may be possible for the individual to increase his ability to empathize by extending the breadth and intimacy of his experience . Diversification of experience with persons and determined effort to view their behavior in the context of their own experience should constitute practice for empathy . Vicarious experience can also be helpful . This may be secured by thoughtful reading of revealing life histories of people depicted in different family situations , by the perusal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married couples and families , and by witnessing realistic dramatic presentations on stage and screen of family interpersonal relations . Command of appropriate responses is certainly the one condition of adaptability most subject to development . Given the incentive and moderate intelligence the married person can , even without empathy , learn by experience the roles , attitudes , and responses appropriate to the spouse 's behavior . This knowledge for the marriage relationship can to some extent be acquired before marriage by study of the sciences dealing with human behavior , such as psychology , sociology , and anthropology . More and more the attempt is being made to provide young people with the available knowledge by courses in preparation for marriage . The value of these courses can be considerably enhanced by emphasis on the significance of footnote1 Karlsson , op. cit. , p. 126.  |p640  adaptability for marital success . Counseling before or after marriage is helpful , in that it provides individuals with appropriate responses and attitudes for anticipated conflict situations , or for conflict which has already materialized . In the latter case counseling can serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of roles , attitudes , or responses inimitable to adjustment . Flexibility also has limits which , like those of empathy , may be set by heredity and early experience . Lack of flexibility or rigidity of personality in many cases , perhaps , can not be changed to any great extent short of some type of psychotherapy . But in some cases , at least , rigid persons can and do change their behavior if their motivation is intense , as it is likely to be in fluid situations or in crises . Because of this circumstance , the question of motivation , as shown earlier , is of paramount importance in considering whether adaptability can be increased . Motivation to adapt probably can be increased in one of two ways . First the person can , if he is willing , put himself in situations where his will to make adaptations will be strengthened . He may join groups , such as those for expectant fathers , young married people 's groups , parent-teacher associations , and others which intensify the interests of their members in successful married life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family living may play an important role in stimulating greater motivations . Pastors may form young married couples ' clubs with emphasis on promoting successful marriage . The family life educator may organize courses dealing with family life situations . These efforts will succeed in the degree that the increase in motivation is not the result of the content of instruction , but the effect of the group upon its members . ADAPTABILITY AND DECISION-MAKING The conditions affecting the capacity for adaptability ? motivation to adapt , empathy , flexibility , and command of appropriate responses ? have been treated as if they were independent of each other . Actually they are present in varying degrees in every act of two persons adapting to each other . It is desirable , however , to develop a theory of adaptability as it operates in decision-making . Such a theory should take account of the interworkings of these conditions of adaptability : First , the interplay of the factors affecting adaptability will be illustrated by an analysis of an illustration of decision-making . Second , three types of decision-making by husbands and wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OF ADAPTABILITY IN DECISION-MAKING The loss of employment by the husband and his failure to secure another job constitutes a marital crisis . 1 ) The determination to make a success of the marriage ( motivation to adapt ) is strong with a husband and wife who find themselves confronted by this situation . They are deeply in love . They conceive of marriage as a companionship relation on a basis of equality . The husband 's unemployment is a crisis . It is a test of the strengths and the weaknesses of the relation . 2 ) The first stage in adapting to the situation is for them to discuss and to define the problem . This is a necessary preliminary to arriving at a solution that is practical and satisfactory to both . If the wife fully understands her husband 's attitudes , she will perceive how menacing being out of work is to his morale and how much he depends upon her for sympathy . He , on his part , will realize that she is as greatly affected in her status as a wife as he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may decide that for some time there will probably be no job opening in his vocation and that ways must be found to provide temporary income and to cut down expenses . 3 ) When the problem has been defined , methods for its solution may then be examined . The husband may take a job of lower status and income . The wife , who has not worked since before the birth of the baby , finds she can get a secretarial position with her former employer . It pays better than the semiskilled temporary job that the husband can obtain . If she accepts the position he must take care of the house and the baby . The husband may theoretically have accepted the perspective of the interchangeability of roles of husbands and wives . But the prospect of actually taking the role of homemaker and baby caretaker while the wife assumes that of economic provider is a test of his flexibility . 4 ) After the decision is reached , the final step is putting it into effect . The success of this effort may depend in large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of roles of husband and wife is a real test of their sensitivity to the attitudes of each other in the shift in their positions in the family . The wife particularly should be careful not to wound by remark or tone of voice the masculine self-respect of her husband . The success of the husband in his new role will depend to a considerable extent upon the experience or training he has had or can quickly acquire in housekeeping skills . The above case assumes that decisions are arrived at by discussion in  |p642  which both participate on a basis of equality . This is the form of decisionmaking that exemplifies the ideals of democratic , companionship marriage . Two other ways of making decisions ? authoritarian and verbal coercion ? are prevalent in American society . All three of these ways have been described by Farber and related to two types of marital dependence . TYPES OF MARITAL DEPENDENCE Farber in a study of decision-making has made a significant distinction between behavioral and emotional dependence . The following discussion is taken , with slight modifications , from his analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material services . It may or may not be reciprocal . It is the expectation by one individual of the performance of a personal service by another . Examples of the conventionalization of these services are the roles of husband as provider and wife as homemaker . In the companionship family the behavioral dependence may take many forms . Among these are the questions of who pays the bills , who gets breakfast for the other , who deals with the janitor , who answers the telephone , who waits on the other . Emotional dependence as defined by Farber is the reliance of the person upon a marriage partner for reassurance , appreciation , and affectional security . It is a personal relation in which the feelings of an individual are contingent upon the feelings of another . The person is sensitized to the other 's outward signs of feeling . The meanings which he attaches to the other 's feelings determine to a large extent his own feelings . He tends to think of the other person as unique , indispensable , and irreplaceable in his conception of marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mate implicit in their relationship . In the condition of emotional independence the person does not require emotional support from his spouse . He is not sensitive to the feelings of the other or , if aware of them , tends to disregard them . He does not conceive of the other person as unique . Having set up goals outside of marriage and the family , he is concerned with gaining his primary emotional satisfactions there . When husband and wife are emotionally dependent upon each other there exists the relationship of emotional interdependence . The other two types of marital relationships are ( 1 ) when one is emotionally dependent and the other emotionally independent and ( 2 ) when both are emotionally independent . footnote ' Bernard Farber , A Study of Dependence and Decision-Making in Marriage ( Chicago , University of Chicago Libraries , M.A. dissertation , 1949 ) , pp. 23 , 36 , 125-27.  |p643  Emotional interdependence in the marriage situation can be described as a relationship between husband and wife in which the feelings which one imputes to the other influence his own feelings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his mate , and the task to be performed . In being behaviorally dependent , the person takes a passive role in the performance of the task and depends upon his mate to perform that task . Marriages may represent any possible combination of emotional dependence and independence and of behavioral dependence and independence . Of the eleven combinations theoretically possible , Farber found seven in his sample of fifteen married couples . TYPES OF DECISION-MAKING Farber distinguishes three types of decision-making . They are authoritarian , mutual verbal coercion , and mutual discussion . The authoritarian decision is one handed down by one spouse and acquiesced in by the other . Farber cites the following instance as an illustration . The wife reports : Jim picked out the furniture . He has pride in it , so I let him . My taste would n't be any better and it makes him happy . He lost money on all the cars that he bought . It would n't do any good to show disapproval . That would just lead to more fighting . I let his own conscience guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wants a new car in February . I 'll let him get it although we ca n't afford it . The typical combination of husband and wife associated with this mode of decision-making is one in which one of the two is emotionally and behaviorally independent and the other emotionally and behaviorally dependent . The authoritarian way of issuing decisions is likely to be associated with the inadaptability of one mate and the submission of the other . In the verbal coercion method the person obtains his mate 's consent to a decision by exerting strong persuasion . Mutual verbal persuasion appears when both husband and wife are emotionally independent and each influences decisions in this way . The verbal coercion method differs from the authoritarian because it implies that the consent of the spouse must be obtained , as in the following instance cited by a husband . When I decided that we needed a new car for my business , it took some convincing on my part , but my wife finally agreed with me , so we bought it and have had no regrets . The third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes place in and through the discussion . In verbal coercion the  |p644  discussion takes place after one person has made the decision . The discussion is to gain the consent of the spouse . In authoritarian decision there is no discussion . An example of the way in which decisions take place by discussion is reported by husband and wife . HUSBAND . We make decisions to plan ahead . Jenny usually makes a plan . I suggest some modifications . Sometimes there is an argument in order to thrash out some problems . WIFE . We discuss the problem . Ordinarily , I 'm sure that I 'm right . However in the case of our moving out of the city , it was necessary for Dave to make the decision and to convince me . I now think he was right . Another decision was opening a bank checking account . He was dead set against it , but I finally talked him into it . Gradually , he sees that I 'm right . AUTHORITARIAN DECISION-MAKING The traditional form of decision-making in the great majority of historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family to announce decisions , and for the wife and and children to accept . The authoritarian pattern still persists , but in the United States the wife and mother quite often is a matriarch . What factors determine whether husband or wife will be dominant in the marriage ? Farber found that the emotionally independent and behaviorally dependent mate tended to dominate over the one who was emotionally dependent . In other words , the inflexible spouse is the one who uses the authoritarian method of making decisions . Mame is the dominant one . I believe she gets her way more often than I. She just gets downright mean if she does n't get her way . It is a lot easier to go along with her than to argue with her . In an authoritarian union there is a minimum opportunity for adaptability . The dominant member is relatively inflexible and has little or no understanding of the feelings of the other . But certain customary practices may mitigate the rule of the family autocrat . The most important of these is the division of activities between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of allocating responsibilities for decisions and avoiding conflicts . In the traditional family of the past the roles of husband and wife were sharply defined . Although the wife had a subordinate position in marriage she had full charge of the domestic realm . In companionship marriage division of activities also takes place , but no sharp line exists between those of husband and wife and frequently they are interchangeable .  |p645  MAN . Decisions about business I make . Social affairs are her realm . She takes care of things about the house mainly . WOMAN . We both dominate our own division . Round the house it more or less runs to what I say , and in business it is all his . We each ask the other 's opinion . We do n't clash . MAN . As far as running the house and taking care of the baby , I do n't interfere at all , and my wife does not interfere with the business . One of the ways of dividing decisions is for the dominant mate to make the major decisions and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really managed to divide our responsibilities . When a thing is very important I let him decide because I think he can decide better . On little things I get my way . I probably get my way more , because more little things come up . But the subordinate person may manifest a certain degree of adaptability by using devices for obtaining his or her ends . Among these are : suggestion , initiating a request , preparing the ground for the request , etc . Suggestion is a method resorted to by a person who is subordinate in the marital relation . The aim is to plant the idea which later the dominant mate expresses as his own . WOMAN . If it is something I want in particular , I say , " Would n't it be nice to do such and such a thing ? " I throw the idea out and try it again every once in a while until all at once it comes out as his idea . Initiation of a request is frequently made by the subordinate person to the dominant mate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My wife brings matters up for decision and sees that a decision is reached , but I make the decision . It is nearly always done as I see that it should be . Preparing the ground for a request is another way of getting it accepted by the dominant mate . WOMAN . He always paid bills , made out his own budget , so I would complain and I did without things . Then when I wanted something badly and he would say , " Would you wait till next month ? " I learned when I wanted something I would have to prepare for it a month or so in advance . Avoidance of responsibility for decisions is the reaction of the dependent person .  |p646  WOMAN . I think I 'm dependent . I usually ask for help in making decisions . I like to be babied . I was the baby of the family and more or less leaned on others . George makes all the decisions . He tells me what I can buy . The direct request is one way of bringing one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MAN . She does not use indirect methods except in asking me to go somewhere . If she wants something for herself she just asks me for it . In the latter case she finds out where I stand first . When I want her to do something I think I go about it the same way . I just ask . If it is something I do n't know whether she would like to do I ask her what she had in mind . Weeping has been traditionally a woman 's way of influencing her husband 's behavior . It is seldom reported , perhaps because it seems out of keeping with modern marriage , with its emphasis on the equality of the sexes . Then , too , it may backfire , especially if it is employed often , or if the husband detects that it is a technique . WOMAN . When I did n't get my own way , I used to cry and get emotional . Louis 's reaction was to get very angry . Saving face is a device that may aid in preserving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dominant wife is manifested in her recognition before others of her husband as the head of the house . MAN . I really feel that she is more dominant emotionally in our marriage . She never makes me feel that way in front of others . In comparing myself with some friends I am distinctly less dominating in the family circle . Another husband states that his friends all regard him as much more dominating than he is , thanks to the submissive pose in public of his wife . VERBAL COERCION When both mates are emotionally independent the making of decisions is often a battle to obtain what one wants . If neither is disposed to yield some way out of the conflict may be found . Three chief means are by compromise , setting limits to the conflict , and tolerance . Compromise is a technique that makes for accommodation especially when both husband and wife desire to be dominant in decisions . Compromise may also be a way of " saving face . " HUSBAND . I wo n't let Genevieve henpeck me and she wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that we each save face . WIFE . Fred has a horror of being henpecked while I have a need of dominating . I think I used to dominate more than I do now . At the same time I will not be dominated .  |p647  HUSBAND . Neither of us takes any steps without consulting the other . We do not want to be boss ? we want to be companions . WIFE . It is a fifty-fifty proposition and I am trying to keep it that way . Setting limits to conflict is a form of accommodation . Couples may agree to disagree upon divided issues or tacitly decide to avoid them . WOMAN . My husband mismanages money in his own way and has oldfashioned ideas about women not knowing anything about money . He would rather mismanage than let me take care of it . We never fight about it . Let him lose his money if he wants to . Other couples know when to place the brakes upon a discussion at the point where it may turn into a quarrel which imperils the rapport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how far you can carry an argument without making it a hot one . Tolerance lowers the level of expectation and thereby reduces friction and conflict in marriage . WOMAN . Oscar is much more stubborn than I. If he thought things were right , they had to be done that way . But he has become much more tolerant ? realizing things ca n't always toe the line that way . Under certain conditions one of the mates may yield to the verbal coercion of the other . Giving in may involve a certain degree of empathy . This is likely to be the case when the mate yields because of his perception of the intensity of the desire or because of the persistence of the other . It may be present when he gives in because of his love for his spouse . Yielding to intensity of desire of the other is a form of adaptability in marriage . As in the following case , the mate gives in on realizing how strongly the other wishes something . WOMAN . I think whoever wants something the most , gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . Yielding to persistence of mate is an accommodation similar to the preceding one . HUSBAND . Fay gets her way more often . She uses persistence in talking to me about what she wants . WIFE . Maybe I get my way more frequently . ( Laughs . ) Yielding because of love for mate is indicative of adaptability . The appeal to love is relied on when the person realizes that he can not make a case for his request which will convince his mate .  |p648  WOMAN . If it is something I want done immediately but do n't have very good reasons that would appeal to his sense , I just say , " do this for my sake . " I do n't use it so often but he usually accedes . The husband or wife may yield to avoid continuing the conflict for the sake of peace or of preserving the marriage . Yielding for the sake of peace has already been considered in connection with the discussion of motivation to adapt . WIFE . I think scolding is the best way of getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just does n't move . When I do n't get what I want I am cross . MAN . If there were any disputes , I let her have her own way and it turned out all right . WOMAN . Usually if I ask him to do something , he wo n't do it right away , but if I act as though I am cross , he will do it right away . He knows I am not cross . Yielding under necessity represents an accommodation when the person realizes that there is no other way out . It is an acceptance of the situation under protest . In the following case , both husband and wife are strong-willed but give in when circumstances require . HUSBAND . I would like to make decisions myself . A man 's supposed to be the head of his house . As long as she is working I have to concede to her . WIFE . I usually give in when I see there is no other way out . I would feel pretty bad , but this would not bother him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the structure of marriage motivates husbands and wives to adapt , in a sense in spite of themselves , to keep the marriage a going enterprise . DISCUSSION , MUTUALITY AND REASONING In the companionship marriage discussion , mutuality , and reasoning are the chief ways relied on in decision-making . Discussion before deciding an issue is the approved method where mates interact on the basis of equality . WIFE . We always talk over all our decisions and make them together . It is very important in marriage to do things together . HUSBAND . We never make decisions separately if we can make them together . Full and frank discussion of issues before making decisions permits a free expression of empathy . Each is then sensitized to the feeling of the  |p649  other and disposed to act as much or more in the other 's interest as in his own . Mutuality or cooperation is one of the most frequently reported principles on which couples rely for marital success . HUSBAND . Recently another chap mentioned to me that he thought the keynote to successful marriage was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One must not do it all . Each must do his part to make it a happy and useful union . WOMAN . I never go ahead without the full approval and consent of Tom . I feel everything is mutual . Frequently the principle of mutuality is expressed in colloquial terms : MAN . Both husband and wife must " give and take . " WIFE . Marriage is on a fifty-fifty basis . HUSBAND . You 'll find that fifty-fifty , while recommended , is n't enough ? better make it sixty-forty , or at times seventy-thirty , each way . Reasoning so as to convince one 's mate to make a desired decision is a prevalent and successful technique in companionship unions . HUSBAND . I usually try to get my way by reasoning . WIFE . When George wants his way , he always has a very good reason for it which I eventually see after my emotions die down . WIFE . Whenever anything comes up , we reason things out and he always has the best reasons . HUSBAND . When it came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although I may be doing just what she wanted me to do . It has always been cooperative , yet she has always given me the feeling she relied on my judgment , and what I felt was the right one . The decision was mutual but left pretty much to myself . Three general ways of making marital decisions have been differentiated . The authoritarian is traditional in American society . It is present when either husband or wife dominates in the relation , either because of cultural expectation , or because one is inflexible and emotionally independent and the other is flexible and emotionally dependent . The mutual verbal coercion way of making decisions arises when both husband and wife enter marriage with the expectation of being dominant in the relation , when both strongly espouse different sides of an issue , and when both are relatively inflexible and emotionally independent . Making deci-  |p650  sions by mutual discussion assumes the acceptance of this mode of action I. as the norm of marriage and is facilitated when both marriage partners are emotionally dependent and are able to understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . THE MEASUREMENT OF ADAPTABILITY At present there is no adequate measure of adaptability which could be used for the quantitative study of its relation to marital success . Despite the importance of this personality characteristic in modern society , little attempt has been made to devise tests of general adaptability or of adaptability in specific relationships such as marriage . Our analysis of the conditions of adaptability provides the framework for a discussion of items that should be included in the construction of a test . EMPATHY A test of empathy in marital relations is highly desirable . None is available . Dymond 1 has devised a test for empathy in general , but its value for engaged and married couples has yet to be demonstrated . Karlsson 's communication index 2 includes a few items that may prove to be of value as indicators of empathy . These are : 1 ) Talking things over with spouse never , almost never , sometimes , almost always , always . 2 ) Mate says things that hurt very frequently , frequently , occasionally , rarely , almost never . 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish , mostly as a demand , about equally as a wish and as a demand . 4 ) Do you understand your mate ? very well , fairly well , poorly . 5 ) Does your mate understand you ? very well , fairly well , poorly . Four of his adaptability items also appear to measure empathy . Married persons were asked to check each of the following " markedly , " " considerably , " " somewhat , " " a little , " " not at all " : 1 ) Understands mate 's wishes ( self-rating ) . 2 ) Understands mate 's wishes ( rating of mate ) . 3 ) Understands mate 's feelings ( self-rating ) . 4 ) Understands mate 's feelings ( rating of mate ) . footnote1 Rosalind Dymond , " A Scale for Measuring Empathetic Ability , " Journal of Consulting Psychology , 13 ( 1939 ) 127-133. 2 Op. cit. , pp. 147-49.  |p651  It will be noted that certain questions require both self-reports and one 's conception of the mate 's understanding of self . The combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of empathy . For example , if a husband reports that he understands his wife " very well " and she replies that he understands her " poorly , " he should receive a low score for empathy . If both agree that he understands her " very well , " he should be awarded a high score . A test of empathy in the context of the engagement and marital relation should be constructed . It should specifically compare the understanding which the person has of the mate with the mate 's conception of him . FLEXIBILITY Psychologists have primarily investigated the condition of adaptability , which we call flexibility . Flexibility has been characterized as the opposite of rigidity , fixation of response , lack of variability , perseveration , etc . ' One psychologist has defined rigidity as " the inability to change one 's set when the objective conditions demand it , as the inability to restructure a field in which there are alternative solutions to a problem in order to solve that problem more efficiently . " 2 This corresponds to our discussion of flexibility and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have employed rather simple motor or intellectual tasks and have tested the rapidity with which persons were able to switch to specified alternative tasks . Sociologists recognize the rigidity of responses which psychologists attribute largely to psychogenic conditioning in early childhood . But they also emphasize the cultural conditioning of reactions to specific situations . As already pointed out , young people enter marriage with more or less set ideas about husband-wife roles impressed upon them in their family and in their other social groups . Often these expectations conflict . Under certain conditions attitudes may be quite as rigid as if they were those of psychotic or neurotic individuals . It is feasible to devise tests of attitudes and expectations and also to measure the intensity with which they are held . Until such tests are available , consideration may be given to two recent indexes which may be taken as measuring flexibility and inflexibility in marital relations . Karlsson prepared two indexes of adaptability . They are actually measures of the flexibility of the person and of his skill in interpersonal relations . The adaptable individual , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milton Rokeach , " Generalized Mental Rigidity as a Factor in Ethnocentrism , " Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology , 43 , 1948 , pp. 259-278. 2 Ibid. , p. 260.  |p652  that he was very much liked by schoolmates , very happy in childhood , very fairly treated by parents , finds it easy to get people to do what they are asked , rarely or almost never is in difficulty with neighbors , etc . The evidence in the second adaptability index comes more decisively from reports of mate rather than from self ratings . The mate reports the spouse as having the following traits " markedly " or " considerably " : affectionate , demonstrative , sense of humor , " gives in " in arguments , a leader outside family , etc . Furthermore the person is characterized by the mate as having the following traits only " a little " or " not at all " : dominating , expecting others to accept his opinion , easily influenced by others , getting angry easily , etc . ' Lu , 2 in her study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devised an index of dominance . The items that were employed as representing dominance might have been used to indicate the inflexible or " rigid " person . Examples of these items are self-reports on need to have own way , does not try to avoid arguments , loses temper easily , tends to dominate opposite sex , stubborn , dominating , does not give in when disagreements arise ; and spouse 's reports of self as argumentative and quicktempered . As already pointed out , certain of these traits like " stubbornness " and dominating and , perhaps , all of them have been conditioned both psychogenically and culturally . This does not detract from their value as indicators of flexibility . If , however , we are interested in modifying the rigidity of an individual it becomes important to find out the extent to which it is cultural and not psychogenic . These items used by Karlsson and Lu merit consideration in future attempts to construct a test of flexibility . MOTIVATION TO ADAPT Tests of motivation to adapt should take into account not motivation in general , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it . These include the factors already considered . First is love of husband and of wife for each other , its relative intensity , and changes in it taking place in marriage . Second is the degree of group pressure impinging on the couple and the nature of the response of husband and of wife to it . Third is their determination to succeed in marriage and the factors influencing it in addition to love and group pressure . Fourth is the analysis of the situation in which the couple is reacting , the degree of its fluidity , its significance for strengthening or weakening the relationship . footnote I See Karlsson , op. cit. , pp. 142 ? 48 for complete list of adaptability items . 2 See p. 52.  |p653  No such test directly related to motivation to adapt in marriage now exists , although questions bearing upon it are to be found in marriage schedules . Command of appropriate marital skills and the extent to which they are dependent on experience and training was studied by Laycock .1 He devised tests in the form of problems for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem which he suggests but did not use was in the field of marriage and is illustrative of his general method : You are keeping company with a young lady and find that her mother is unfavorably disposed towards you . She does not object to your family or prospects , but seems to dislike you personally . What would you do ? This problem suggests the wide range of situations which could be covered to measure courtship as well as marital competence . A test of marital competence should cover alternative courses of action in relations with in-laws and friends , disagreements and conflicts between husband and wife over demonstration of affection , household finances , intimate relations , life goals , recreation , religion , etc . The tests could be given both to engaged and married persons . Research on the role of adaptability in marital success can not have a firm basis until tests are developed or indexes found for the four conditions of this factor . It may indeed be possible to develop test situations or to discover indexes which embrace two , three , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed that the sociocentric person is in general more adaptable than the egocentric individual . The sociocentric person tends to be responsive to the attitudes and interests of other persons , while the egocentric tends to regard his social relations from the standpoint of self-feeling . The sociocentric person tends to be sympathetic rather than critical of others , to be considerate rather than inconsiderate , and is disposed to act positively in relation to social attitudes and values . If our assumption is correct , the sociocentric person should tend to be more capable of empathy , more flexible , have greater knowledge of appropriate responses and be more motivated to incorporate them into his behavior patterns . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Adaptability is ' not a unit trait but a complex of components . These have been identified as empathy , flexibility , motivation to adapt , and command of appropriate responses . footnote'Samuel R. Laycock , Adaptability to New Situations ( Baltimore : Warwick and York ) , 1929.  |p654  All of these can be considered , not as general characteristics of the person , but as responses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be susceptible to change . In other words , the adaptability of the individual may be increased in the degree to which he is able to develop further his capacity for empathy , to become more flexible in his marital and other relations , to take advantage of situations which intensify motivation to adapt , and to learn and put into practice knowledge and skills desirable for marriage . - Marriage is one of the few major human activities for which our culture provides no formal and even little informal training . Training for marriage might seem to be indicated , since ninety per cent of all adult persons marry , and one out of every four marriages ends in divorce . Even more important are other reasons . Urban American society today is bewilderingly complex in comparison with the rural life of one hundred years ago . Increasingly each couple is on its own to design its individual pattern of family living . Young people are eager to realize the highest potentialities in marriage for themselves and for their children . Adaptability has become an outstanding characteristic to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of our economic and social life . In the past women , because of cultural expectation , have been disposed to be more adaptable than have men . The success of marriages probably could be greatly increased if bridegrooms entered matrimony with as great expectation of the necessity of making adaptations as do their brides . Competence is quite as important for marital success as for success in a trade , a business , a profession , or an avocation . Education for marriage and family living should therefore make available to engaged and married persons all the pertinent scientific knowledge on human behavior in t general and on marriage and the family in particular . Adaptability is essential for competence . But competence transcends adaptability . Competence emphasizes planning for the design of marriage that will best give expression to the aspirations and expectations of husband and wife . Young people will demand , in increasing numbers , available knowledge and experience that they can utilize in constructing an individualized plan for their own marriage . Training for marital competence requires , among other things , recognition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage and an understanding of the conditions for its expression and development . Certain points about adaptability need to be kept in mind . First , by inheritance or through experience certain individuals are more adaptable than others . This may be largely due to differences in empathy .  |p655  Second , adaptability is in large part an attitude of mind . A person may for various reasons be predisposed to be flexible or to be rigid in a particular situation , such as that of marriage . Third , husbands and wives differ in the strength of their motivations to adapt to each other and to marriage . Fourth , adaptability may in some part be a matter of training . Persons may be able to increase their adaptability in marriage by taking courses in preparation for it , by availing themselves of premarital and marital counseling , and by learning to be understanding of the attitude and behavior of the marriage partner . Undoubtedly , adaptability will continue to play a developing role in marital competence and success . All conditions making for changes , emergencies , and crises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The tempo of social change is continually increasing so that modifications in marriage and family relations are constantly required . Never before in human history have marriage and the family experienced such a continuous series of momentous and shattering events . In the space of forty years the United States has undergone two World Wars , its greatest economic crisis , and a staggering increase in the burden of taxation . At present the country has a standing army of three million men , youth is facing the duty of military service , and the menace of inflation threatens the nation . The only certainty has become uncertainty . Recognizing this ominous situation , The National Council on Family Relations chose as its central theme for its 1952 meeting " Family Planning for a Permanent Emergency . " Just as important in the long run are the tremendous social transformations taking place in the wake of scientific discoveries and technological inventions . Control over the atom is a symbol of the constructive and destructive significance of nearly every technological advance . Perhaps most revolutionary of all are the social effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , radio , and television . The changes taking place in marriage and the family are a response to these changes in the conditions of our existence . Stability of attitudes and behavior belonged to simpler static societies . Adaptability is necessary for survival and success under conditions of emergency and rapid change .
