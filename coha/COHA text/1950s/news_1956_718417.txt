txt The air ministry released today the story , of an air force pilot maneuvering eight miles up who was pitched out of his jet plane by a defect in his ejector seat . He wound up on the ground 15 minutes later with a zracturea ankle . The pilot 's accidental para . chute journey thru the wild blue yonder occurred last March but the air ministry kept the incident under wraps pending investigation and con ? consideration of modifications in the seat . Investigators figure he was fired out of his plane at about 43,000 feet . The highest test for an ejection seat in Britain has been at 40,000 feet . He Tells His Story In telling his story to reporters today , Flight Lt. Roy Watson , 28 , commented : " I had just enough time to realize what was happening , but not enough to do anything about it . " I heard a crash , which was the first of the ejector cartridges going off . The seat jerked upward . Then the second cartridge went off , and the seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the seat and my bone dome crash helmet smashed the canopy . Out Five Seconds " I was grayed out semiconscious for about five or six seconds as I fell , still in my seat . I had lost my oxygen mask and crash helmet , and had no face screen , but I must have had enough oxygen in my body to keep me going . " I could see almost the whole of the East Anglia coastline and judged I was still above 35,000 feet . Also I had a big worry , As I fell I wondered if the seat release had been damaged . " But at 10,000 feet , this automatic barometric pressure mechanism tossed him gently from the seat and his parachute billowed out above him . Hits Ground Hard " I hit the ground heavily and broke my ankle , " he said . " Altogether it took me 15 minutes to get down . It seemed as long as a losing day at the races . " His plane , a Hunter jet , crashed in a farmyard 12 miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
