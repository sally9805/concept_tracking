This time no less than four teams are potential titlists , with the Bee Gees a slight favorite . Veteran Coach Harold Anderson starts his 18th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half dozen untested sophomores . Husky All-America candidate Jimmy Darrow , 5-foot-11 senior guard who has scored 1,035 points in two seasons , will share the main burden with springy Rex Leach , who gets the rebounds . Senior Center Ron Parsons is tall enough at 6 feet 8 to enable the Falcon offense to blend single-pivot plays with its fast break , while Jim Routson , who has played both center and forward , will settle down at the latter . A fifth starter will emerge from a trio comprised of letterman Dick Kuzma and sophs Dennis Reed and Tommy Falantano . A newcomer to the title chase after an uninterrupted climb from the 1956-57 cellar is KENT STATE , where Coach Bill Bertka begins his third year with seven veterans , seven big sophomores and a starting lineup averaging 6 feet 4 . The league 's best defensive club last year , Kent will employ a controlled fast-break offense led by all-conference Forward Oliver Wallace , who is ineligible for the first quarter of the season but who will be available for all conference games . Another junior , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others capable of double-figure production are Jack Moore , Denny Bayer and soph Chet Thomas . Jerry McGinty , Pete Baltic and Jim Maddox are back to provide the best depth in years , while newcomers Fred Brown and Paul Walker will also press for starting assignments . It is also time for a patient rebuilding program to bear fruit at TOLEDO , whose climb has paralleled that of Kent . Coach Ed Melvin has all his starters back , plus enough depth and speed . George Patterson is the most talked-about center in the league . Forwards John Papcun , Willie Newson and Ned Miklovic are all skilled veterans , while the backcourt includes last year 's top scorers , Bob Pawlak and Jerry Galicki , as well as Ron Oranski . An inexperienced front line places MIAMI in the unaccustomed role of contender rather than favorite . High-scoring Guards Jim Hamilton and Dave Zeller back up a tall but green forward wall that averages 6 feet 5 . Five sophomores , led by Dave Mack and LeVern Benson , add to Miami 's good depth and speed , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title in his three years as coach . One of the shootingest , runningest teams in this fast-break league has always been MARSHALL , and the Big Green will be at it again despite the loss of All-America Leo Byrd , No. 2 scorer in the nation last year . John Milhoan , a 6-foot-4 guard who hit 49% of his 316 shots last year , will fill the scoring gap left by Byrd , but running mate Lou Mott is the only starter back to help him make this the 24th straight season Marshall has played .500 ball or better . An inexperienced forward line includes 6-foot-8 soph Bob Burgess , Jim Gallion and either Chuck Gordon or Starling Miller . Welcome news for Coach Jule Rivlin is the return of " rebounder Herm Conner , out last year with a bad knee . Reserve Center Bruce Moody and four more big sophs round out the squad . Extreme speed and the enthusiasm of four sophomore starters must compensate for inexperience at WESTERN MICHIGAN . Peppery junior Guard Sam Key is joined by a fresh foursome of Bob James , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a league that is seldom fun for neophytes . Coach Don Boven will relegate three of last year 's regulars to reserve ranking , including Bob Bolton , Ernie Scott and Steve Holmes . The tall sophs should alleviate last season 's critical lack of rebounding and help patch the holes in a very porous defense . At OHIO juniors Bunk Adams , Howard Jolliff and Larry Kruger , fine front-court performers , team with Guard Dale Bandy to do what they can to preserve something of last year 's status , despite the graduation of four of the team 's five top scorers . Reserves Bruce Johnson , Verlynn Witte and Bob Gaunt , plus soph Bill Whaley all need experience , and they 'll probably get it quickly .
