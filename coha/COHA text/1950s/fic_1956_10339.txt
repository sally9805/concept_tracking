his mother had come into the room with milk and cookies and he had a feeling this was one of the things , like dying , not to talk about in front of grownups . Albert Barker had never come back to visit him . The kids had visited him once or twice , in the beginning , but then they 'd stopped , because there was n't anything much to do , just sitting around the room like that . But his mother had said they were waiting for him to get better and be able to come out and play with them again and then they 'd be just as good friends as ever . He did n't really mind their not coming to see him , because his mother was around all the time , but he 'd have liked to see Albert Barker once more and get that straight . He wondered if Susan Nickerson knew about it . She seemed to know a lot about a lot of things . Only she did n't pay much attention to him .

He wished the summertime would last longer . He 'd figureout some way of making Susan Nickerson pay attention to him if the summertime lasted long enough . Summertime was better than winter . People were together more in the summertime . In the winter everybody was in a hurry . In the winter everybody separated and became absent-minded . Jeff was going to college and he would n't see him for months . Maybe forever . Forever . It was a bad word , but sometimes you had to face words like that . And even if he did see him , it would n't be the same thing . People were one way if you saw them all the time , every day , and they were another thing if you only saw them every couple of months . They really were thinking about something else after a couple of months.  |p101That  was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school  --  when he got back his mother would be thinking about something else . Grownups did n't seem to mind that . When they left each other , they said good-bye and shookhands and they did n't care if they did n't see each other for months  --  for years  --  forever . Grownups did n't really know how to be friends . Even when his grandmother had died and they 'd buried her , his father had n't changed much . His father had read the paper at breakfast the next morningand the day after the funeral he 'd gone off to work as usual and after a week or so he was playing bridge at night , just as though nothing had happened . Tony shivered a little and pulled the blankets up around him . He was sorry he had started thinking about things like that . Still , if his mother died , he 'd guarantee hewould n't be playing bridge a week later . Maybe the thing to be was a doctor , a scientist . Then you could work on a serum to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You would keep it very quiet and then one day you would take the monkey to the auditorium of a college , and everybody would be sitting there , wondering , waiting to hear what you had to say , and you 'd lead the monkey onto the stage and you 'd say , " Gentlemen , forty years ago I injected this monkey with my secret serum , Number Qy zero seven . You will notice that he has no gray hairs and he can swing from the highesttrees . " Then you 'd be very strict about who got any of the serum . You 'd start with your mother and father and Jeff and Dr. Patterson , but there 'd be a lot of people to whom you 'd say , " No , I 'm sorry , there is n't enough to go around . " No matter what they offered you . You would n't give your reasons , but you 'd have darn good reasons , every time . He chuckled to himself , under the blankets , as hep102thought of what people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is n't enough to go around . " He turned over on his side and he was just about to close his eyes , thinking of the immortal old monkey , when he saw someone coming across the lawn toward the house . He stopped breathing for a moment , and did n't move , watching . Then he saw that it was his mother , in a loose , open coat , coming across the grass . There was a light mist , close to the ground , and his mother seemed to be floating toward him over a gray lake . He did n't say anything until she reached the porch . She stopped then and turned around and looked out over the mist for a few seconds . It was very dark , just one little light coming through the curtains from inside the house , on the other side of the porch , but he could tell that his mother was smiling . " Mummy , " he said , whispering , because it was so late and so dark . Even though he spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She came over to him and leaned over him and kissed his forehead . " What 're you doing up ? " she asked . " I was listening to the owls , " he said . " Where were you ? " " Oh , " she said , " I just took a little walk . " " You know what I 'm going to be when I grow up ? " he said . " What , darling ? " " A doctor . I 'm going to experiment with monkeys . " She laughed and touched his hair with her fingers . " When did you decide that ? " " Tonight . " But he did n't tell her his reasons . The reasonscould wait . " Well , " she said , " this has been a very important night , has n't it ? " " Yes , " he said . She leaned over and kissed him . She smelled warmp103and her coat smelled of pine needles , as though she had brushed against saplings in the woods . " Good night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight . " She went into the house and he closed his eyes . He heard her moving around softly inside the house , and then the light was put out and it was quiet . It was lucky , he thought , that I did n't go in to see if she was there when I woke up . I would n't have found her and I 'd 've been scared . The owls stopped hooting , because the dawn was comingup , and he slept.  |p104Tony  came home in the middle of the afternoon , much earlier than he had expected . The hayride was supposed to have taken all day with a picnic lunch at Lookout Rock at the end of the lake and an expedition into the caves there . They 'd had the lunch all right and they had taken a quick look at the caves but Tony had been glad when it began to rain a little bit and Bert , who was driving the team , had rounded them all up and started back around two o'clock . All the other children on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a confusion of mothers and nurses and Tony had spent the day feeling alternately superior and deserted . He would n't have gone on the ride at all except that Jeff had taken the day off to go into Rutland to the dentist . His mother had said that she was going to be busy and he could tell that she wanted him to go . But now it was only about four o'clock and here he was back at the cottage , alone . He looked through the house for his mother but she was n't there . There wasp105a note on the kitchen table from her , saying that she had gone into town to the movies and that she would be back by five o'clock . He took an apple and went out on the porch , eating it , and looked at the lake . It was a cold day and the lake looked gray and mean . He wished the sun would come out so lie could go swimming . He finished the apple and wound up carefully and threw it at a tree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough weight for accurate pitching , he decided . He thought of trying to get a hitch into town with the hotel bus to look for his mother . Then he decided against that . Whenever he went looking for her and found her any place she would smile at first and seem very glad to see him and then she 'd say , " Now , Tony , you must n't tag after me all the time . " He went in and looked at the clock in the living room . It hardly paid to go into town to look for her in the movies if she was going to be back by five . Anyway he had no money and he would n't know how to get into the theatre . He had never been to the movies . First he was too young , his father said . And then it was bad for his eyes . His father disapproved of the movies . His father disapprovedof a lot of things . His father kept saying , " When you 're older , Tony . When you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was twenty years old he would be so busy catching up on all the things his father disapproved of now that he 'd never have any time to sleep . He went onto the porch again and put a record on the phonograph that Jeff had loaned him . The record was " I Get a Kick Out of You . " He listened critically to the words for a while and turned the volume up good and high so that it sounded as though he had a party going on the porch . Then he went into his mother 's room and picked up the long mirror on a stand that she had against the wall and carried it out to the porch . When he was younger andp106his mother was n't home and he was waiting for her he would very often go into her room and sit on her bed , refusing to move until he heard her coming into the house . But he was too old for that now . There was a baseball bat leaning against the wall of the porch and he picked it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took up a stance in front of the mirror , his left leg out in front of him the way Jeff had shown him and a good distance between his feet . He waved the bat gently and menacingly over his shoulder , waiting for the pitch , staring at himself in the mirror with cold , alert eyes . He stepped in , in a nice clean movement , the way Jeff had showed him , and swung at a waist-high ball , bending his knees a little , watching himself closely in the mirror . He let two balls go past , twitching his bat a little , but they were wide . Then he swung four or five more times , remembering to snap his wrists and get his shoulders behind the ball and remembering not to step in the bucket . When he had enough of batting he went over and picked up the fielder 's glove and ball . He and Jeff had a game that they played . They threw pickups and backhand catches to each other and the one who missed ten first , lost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shinglesof the porch . Jeff had won twenty-two times and Tony had won twice . With the ball , in front of the mirror , Tony practiced pickups and backhands and a funny catch with the glove held close to his belly for high pop flies that Jeff called a basket catch and which he said was a specialty of a shortstop called Rabbit Maranville who played for Boston . It was n't as easy as it looked , especially if at the same time you had to watch yourself in the mirror . While he was in the middle of it he heard someone come up behind him . He did n't turn around and a moment later he saw that it was Susan Nickerson . She was dressed in the blue jeans and sweater which seemed to be her uniform.  |p107He  had seen her earlier in the day at the hotel , just before the hayride . He 'd asked her if she was going but she had said , " No . Hayrides 're for kids . " He threw the ball up two or three more times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it each time that it came down , conscious of Susan watching him . Finally she was the one to talk first . " Hi , " she said and he had a small sensation of victory . " Hi , " he said , continuing to toss and catch the ball . Susan came up closer to him and looked at him suspiciously . " What are you doing there ? " " Developing my hands , " Tony said . " One thing an infielderhas to have is sure hands . " " What do you need the mirror for ? " Susan asked . She looked into the glass above Tony 's shoulder and pushed delicately at her hair . Her hair was long for a girl her age and was cut in a way that made her look much older than she was . " To correct my form , " Tony said . " All the big ones use mirrors . " Susan sighed as if this subject , like all others , proved , upon examination , to be instantaneously boring . For a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression , as though she were figuring out just how to handle this particular beast at this particular moment . Then she began to prowl slowly around the porch , picking up books , staring at them coldly , letting them drop , touching a magazine with her fingertips , standing in front of the phonograph and listening without pleasure to the music that was blaring out of the loudspeaker . " Are you alone ? " she asked . " Yeah . " " This place sure is dead , " Susan said . " Is n't it ? " Tony shrugged and turned away from the mirror , making a pocket in the glove with his other fist . " I do n't know , " he said . " Maybe for girls . "  | " Where 's Jeff ? " Susan asked flatly . " He went into Rutland , " Tony said . " He had a bad tooth . " " Uh-huh , " Susan said , in her policewoman 's voice . " Rutland . " She turned the volume of the phonograph down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , in the tone of a hostess politely making conversation on a subject which was of no interest to her , for the benefit of an awkward guest . " She went to the movies , " Tony said . " I 'll be able to go to the movies myself in about another month . " " She went to the movies , " Susan said , putting only a fraction of a question mark at the end of the phrase . " Yeah . " " What 's playing ? " " I do n't know , " Tony said . " Ask her when she gets back . " Susan turned the phonographdown even lower . " Why ? " " Just curious , " Susan said . " Maybe I 'll ask my mother to take me tonight . Where did you get the phonograph ? " " It 's Jeff 's , " Tony said . " He got it from an aunt as a present when he went away to college . She 's rich and she 's always giving him presents . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an expert on swing . " " He thinks he 's something , " Susan said . " Does n't he ? " " He is something , " said Tony . " He talks as though be 's fifty years old , " said Susan . From the tone in which she said it , it was clear that she considered this one of the gravest charges possible to make against a man . " He 's the smartest man you 're ever likely to know , " said Tony combatively . " That 's what you think , " said Susan . Tony would have liked to say something crushing andp109final . But nothing crushing came to his mind . " Yeah , " he said lamely , and knowing that it sounded lame , " that 's what I think . " Susan shrugged . She went over to the phonograph and switched it off . The music ended with a sliding , unpleasantsound . " What did you do that for ? " Tony asked . " I hate jazz , " said Susan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instruments . " Tony went over to the phonograph and started it again . " Well , I like it , " he said . " And this is my house . " " It 's your father 's house , " Susan said , like a lawyer . " Hepays the rent . " " If it 's my father 's , " said Tony , " it 's mine . " " That does n't necessarily follow , " said Susan . " Still , if that 's the way you feel , I 'll leave . " " Go ahead , " said Tony , but with no conviction in his voice . " Okay , " said Susan . " I only came around because this place is so dead . " She started off the porch slowly , with her little , bumpy , beach-balloon walk . Tony watched her obliquely , glumly . Then with a sudden movement he picked the playing arm off the record and stopped the machine . " Aaah . . . " he said , " I 'm not crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile of satisfaction crossed the girl 's face , the policewoman at the moment of confession . " That 's better , " she said . She came back onto the porch . " What three instruments do you play ? " Tony asked . " The piano , the trombone and the cello . " Impressed despite himself and determined not to show it , Tony competed with her by picking up the telescope and staring up with an expert air at the sky . " The sky , " he said , " is full of cirrus cumulus clouds . The ceiling is about a thousand feet and visibility is less than a mile . "  |p110Susan  shrugged . " Who wants to know stuff like that ? " " And at Mount Wilson , that 's in California , they got a telescope so strong they can see the stars in the daytime . I bet you did n't know that either . " " Who wants to know about that ? " Gently , triumphantly , Tony closed the trap . " Who wants to know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do , " said Susan . " I show a lot of promise . " " Who told you ? " Tony asked skeptically . He had discoveredthat a mixture of skepticism and hostility served to bridge the gap in age and sex between them and put him , at least for the moment , on a footing of approximate equality with her . " Mr. Bradley told me , " Susan said . " He 's the music teacher at school . He conducts the orchestra and the band . I play the trombone in the band at football games because you ca n't carry a cello around with you . Mr. Bradley says I have great natural ability . He tried to kiss me in the auditorium last winter . He tries to kiss all the girls . He kissed three of the first violinists last year . " " What did he want to do that for ? " Tony asked , trying not to show how fascinating he found the conversation . Susan shrugged . " He likes it . " " What did you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him , " Susan said flatly . " Why ? " " Why not ? " Susan said . " But when he tried to rub me I told him I would go to the principal and he stopped . He 's very artistic , Mr. Bradley . When he plays the violin he closes his eyes . In the movies when they kiss they alwaysclose their eyes too . Your mother , " she said , " she 's at the movies now ? " " I told you . " " I just wanted to make sure , " Susan said . She took a slow deliberate turn around the porch , going up on herp111toes like a ballet dancer on each step . " Did you ever kiss a girl ? " she asked . " I . . . I . . . sure , " Tony said . " How many ? " Tony hesitated , searching for a reasonable number . " Seventeen , " he said finally . Susan came up to him and stood in front of him . He noticed uncomfortably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . " Let me see , " she said coldly . " What do you mean ? " Tony said , stalling for time and trying to make his voice low and gruff . " Let me see . " A weary flicker of a smile twitched across Susan 's face without making a change in her cold , coinlike , mistrustful blue eyes . " I bet , " she said , " you never kissed a girl in your whole life . " " I did so , " Tony said , feeling cornered and wishing he was at least two inches taller . " I dare you , " said Susan . " Okay , " Tony said . He felt as if he had a fever and he wished that somebody would come in quickly and interruptthem . But nobody came . He advanced warily and kissed Susan . His aim was off for the first kiss and he landed more or less on her chin . She bent her knees a little and this time he found her mouth . He kissed her quickly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it . " There , " he said , his arm still around her . " Take your glasses off , " Susan said . Tony took off his glasses and put them carefully on the phonograph . Then he kissed her again . She tasted pleasantlyof spearmint chewing gum and he began to enjoy it . Satisfied in her experiment , Susan stepped back . " This place is dead , " she said . She took a pocket mirror and a lipstick out of her blue jeans and fixed her mouth , makingTony wish that he did n't feel so feverish and that he was at least five years older . " If there were any boys ofp112my age group around , " said Susan , " I would n't even be here . " Tony stared at her , puzzled . He knew that he was hurt but he did n't know why he should feel that way . Distractedlyhe picked up his telescope and stared at the sky . " The ceiling is lifting , " he said . Susan studied him bleakly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cage for the night . " Do you know what grownups do when they go to sleep together ? " Susan asked . " Sure , " Tony said falsely . " What do they do ? " Susan asked . Tony remembered what young Barker had told him on this subject . But it was all so confused in his mind and Barker had been so vague about actual details that he was afraid that to try to repeat what he had heard to Susan would only show her how hopelessly ignorant he was . " Well , " he said uncomfortably , " I only know kind of . . " Do you or do n't you ? " Susan asked implacably . Tony reached down and got his glasses and put them on again , fighting for time . " Jeff started to tell me something the other day , " he mumbled . " He said my father wanted him to . Something about . . . about seeds . " " Seeds , " Susan snorted disdainfully . " That shows how much you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tony asked , hoping to save himself by attack . " I watched my mother and father one night , " said Susan . " My second father . They came home late and they thought I was sleeping and they forgot to close the door . Did n't you ever watch your father and mother ? " " No , " said Tony . " They never do anything . " " Sure they do , " said Susan . " They do not . "  | " Do n't be a kid , " Susan said wearily . " Everybody does . " " Not my mother and father . " His voice was very high now . He did n't know why he felt he had to deny it so hotly , but it had something to do with the grunting piglikenoise Albert Barker had made . " Stop saying that , " said Susan . He felt himself on the verge of tears and he hated her for being there and talking like that . " You 're dirty , " he said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me names , " Susan said warningly . " You 're a dirty girl , " Tony repeated . " Go see for yourself , " said Susan . " And not with your father either . " " You 're a liar , " Tony said . " The movies ! " Susan made a contemptuous gesture with her hand . " There are no movies except on Saturday and Sunday . They can tell you anything , ca n't they , and you 'll believe it ? What a kid ! " She made a savage , pointinggesture behind her . " You go down to his sister 's house and look through the window the way I did and you 'll see whether I 'm a liar or not . " Tony swung at her with the telescope , clumsily , but she was very quick and stronger than he was . They wrestled for the telescope for a moment and she tore it from his hands and tossed it onto the floor . They stood there facing each other , panting . " Do n't you hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disdainfully . " Baby , " she said . " Stupid little baby . And do n't forget to take your glasses . " She turned on her heel and went off , her hips swinging under the tight blue jeans . Tony stared after her , biting back tears . Then , without knowing why he did it , he went into the house , into his mother 's room and sat down on his mother 's bed . The room smelled of his mother 's perfume and the special soap she used that she had sent up from New York . Thenp114he jumped up and went out on the porch again . It was quiet and the clouds had come even lower and the lake looked meaner and grayer than before . He stood there in the silence for a moment , then jumped off the porch and began to run through the woods , along the lakeshore , in the direction of Jeff 's sister 's house.  |p115It  was almost dark as Lucy and Jeff approached the cottage . Through a break in the clouds the sun could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat turning the lake into a leaden rose color . Across the water a bugle blew . It sounded much farther away than usual , wavery and muffled and saddened by the thick weather . Lucy was wearing a raincoat draped like a cape across her shoulders and it fell in stiff archaic folds around her body as she walked slowly , with Jeff a pace behind her , across the lawn toward the cottage . She climbed the two steps to the porch and stopped , listening to the bugle . She started to take the coat off and Jeff reached out and lifted it from her shoulders and put it down on a chair and turned her around slowly . She ducked a little and smiled up at him , her head tilted to one side . His face seemed to be fragmented in the oblique sunset light into four or five different expressions , as though he were not quite sure whether he was , at the moment , the conquerorp116or the conquered , whether he was happy remembering the afternoon or in despair because it was over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lucy went over to a table and picked up a package of cigarettes that was lying on it . " No matter where I am , " Jeff said , lighting her cigarette , " whenever I hear a bugle call from now on , it will make me remember . " " Shh . . . " Lucy said . Jeff tossed the match away and stared at her , at the long , gray , half-closed , smiling eyes , with their incongruous hint of the Orient and their look of guarding a secret she would never disclose , at the full soft lips that now , without any lipstick on them , blending into the tan skin of her face , seemed almost colorless . " Oh , Lord , " he said softly . Withoutembracing her he ran one hand slowly and lightly down her side and then made a slow , caressing movement across her belly . " What an excellent place , " he whispered . Lucy chuckled . " Shh . . . " she said . She captured his hand , raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm . " Tonight , " Jeff began . Lucy kissed his fingertips with a light brisk smack of the lips , as one might kiss a child 's hand . " That 's all , " she said . She dropped his hand and opened the door of the cottage . " Tony , " she called into the house . " Tony , where are you ? " There was no answer and she turned back to Jeff . he had picked up the glove and ball that Tony had dropped an hour before and was tossing the ball up and making fancy little backhand catches . " He 's probably still on the hayride , " Jeff said . " Do n't worry . He 'll be back in time for dinner . " " I want to go in and change my clothes , " said Lucy . Jeff put the glove and ball down . " Please do n't , " he said to her . " Stay here . You do n't have to change . I'mp117crazy about this dress . " He touched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm cruelly attached to this dress . " " All right , " she said . " We do anything you want because . . . " She paused . " Because why ? " Jeff asked . " Because you 're twenty years old , " said Lucy . " That 's a hell of a reason , " Jeff said . " There are no better ones , little boy , " Lucy said lightly . She lay back on the glider against the pillows , her legs over the edge , her feet on the floor . Jeff stood looking down at her as she let her head fall back , the smoke of the cigarette making her close her eyes . " Oh , Lord , " Jeff murmured . " You must stop saying Oh , Lord , ' " Lucy said . " Why ? " " Because it brings in an entirely new concept . You 'll end up by making me feel guilty and I do n't want to feel guilty . And sit down . You must n't loom over me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his back against the glider , his head near her waist . " I like to loom over you . " " Only at carefully specified hours , " said Lucy . She touched his head with her fingertips , on the back of his neck . " Delicious , " she said . " You must never let your hair grow long . " " Okay , " said Jeff . Lucy ran her hand over his head . " You have a hard , persistent skull , " she said . " Okay . " " Your hair smells like Tony 's , " said Lucy . " Like summertime . Dry and sunshiny . When men get older their hair smells different . Cigarettes , worry , fatigue , barber shops . " " What does fatigue smell like ? " Jeff asked  |p118Lucy  considered this . " The way aspirin tastes , " she said finally . " If I were a man I 'd only make love to seventeenyear-oldgirls , glossy , plump , brand new . " " If I were a man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . " Lucy chuckled . " What nice manners you have ! Tell the truth . How many girls have you had ? " " One . " " Oh , " Lucy said . " That makes two , including me . " " That makes one , including you . " " You really do have nice manners . Of course I do n't believe you . " " All right , " Jeff said . " I 'll confess . I 'm a dazzler . Half a dozen women have committed suicide for me since I was fifteen . I 'm a bigamist . I 'm wanted in ten different states by other names . I seduced by grandmother 's best friend at the age of four and I 've been busy ever since .

" I was waiting for something "  --  he hesitated  --  " something overwhelming . I do n't believe in anything casual or unimportant or imperfect . Thep119girls I knew . " He shrugged . " They were pretty or cute or they were amusing . Never overwhelming . " " My , " said Lucy . " You are a romantic boy .

" Lucy tossed her cigarette away and straightened the folds of her dress with two or three efficient movements of her hand . " And now , " she said , " I think I 'd like to go down to the bar and get a drink . " She stood up . Without turning around , Jeff threw his arm back , to push her down gently again .

Lucy stood up briskly and picked up her raincoat . " I think it 's time we went and got me that drink , " she said . " Answer me , " said Jeff . " You must n't be silly .

" While what ? " Lucy asked . " While we 're together . " Lucy finished buttoning the coat and put the collar upagainst her ears . " And just how long will that be ? " Jeff swallowed miserably . " I do n't know , " he said . " Give me a figure , " said Lucy . " Two days ? A week ? Aseason ? Five years ? " Jeff came over to her but did n't touch her . " Do n't be angry . " He spoke brokenly . " It 's just that I ca n't bear the thought . . . Listen , we can see each other all the time . I can come down to the city at least once a month . And the holidays  --  Thanksgiving , the Christmas vacation . And almost every week-end I can get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this very seriously . " Uhuh . Boston . What hotels do you propose I stop at ? The Ritz ? The Copley ? Or perhaps one of the traveling-salesmen hotels . The Touraine ? The Statler ? And should I wear my wedding ring ? " Jeff put up his hands as though to ward off blows . " Lucy , " he said , tortured . " Do n't . " " And how should I introduce you in Boston ? " Lucy went on . " As my son ? My nephew ? An old friend ? " " Do n't make it ugly , " Jeff said angrily . " What do you propose I tell my husband ? A person who shall be nameless has raised certain objections to . . . " " Stop it , " Jeff said . " There are a lot of ways of doing things like that . " " Are there ? " Lucy said , sounding agreeably surprised . " Perhaps you 'll write me a note . As a budding diplomat . It 'll be good practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a protest to the Prime Minister of Iran or a sharpp122reminder to the Hungarian Foreign Office . Dear Sir : It has come to the attention of this office that there are several conflicting claims on the body of your wife . . . " " Do n't make fun of me , " said Jeff . He was sullen now . " What do you expect me to do ? " he pleaded . " Lucy , darling , it 's been perfect up to now . Are you going to blame me because I want to keep it that way ? " " Perfect . " Lucy nodded in ironic agreement . " They loved each other perfectly  --  on school holidays , in various inexpensive hotel rooms  --  and the young man always managed to get to his first class on Monday on time . Is that your idea of perfect ? " " Oh , God , " Jeff said . " I feel so trapped . If I were older , settled , with some money of my own . . . " " Then what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off together , " Jeff said . " Get married . Live together . " Lucy hesitated for a moment . Then she spoke in a low , assuaging voice . " Be glad , " she said , " that you 're not older , settled , with money of your own . " " Why ? " " Because I would n't go with you . " " Do n't say that . " " And then , " Lucy said , " you 'd blame yourself instead of your youth or your poverty . And it would hurt a lot more . This way you can go back in the autumn and boast in the dormitories on the cold nights about the lively summeryou had at your sister 's house in the mountains . I can just hear you say it now and I forgive you in advance and half envy you the pleasure you 're going to have in saying it . I do n't know what it is about me , ' you can say , but married women of a certain age '  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves at me . ' " " What are you trying to do ? " Jeff asked . " I 'm trying to tell you , " Lucy said , " that summertimep123is summertime . That the hotels close . That the cottages are shuttered against the snow . That the lake freezes over . That the birds fly south . That the children go back to school and the grownups go back to . . . to shopping lists , bridge games , imperfection , security , reality . . . Now Jeff 's face looked stricken in the last cold rays of the sun . " You do n't love me , " he said . Lucy came over to him , smiling gently . " Even that is n't quite true , " she said . Lightly she took his chin in her hand and kissed him . Then she relinquished him and shrugged . " Do n't look so sad , little boy , " she said , turning away . " The summertime still has two weeks to go . " Jeff took a step after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the shade of the trees , walking slowly toward the house across the lawn . Lucy saw him at the same time and stepped off the porch to greet the boy . Tony stopped and regarded his mother and Jeff without expression . He looked tired and , in the gray light , pale . " Hello , Tony , " Lucy said . " Where have you been until now ? " " No place much , " Tony said . He carefully avoided goingclose to his mother as he stepped on the porch . " How was the hayride ? " Jeff asked . " Okay , " said Tony . He leaned against the wall of the porch and examined Jeff . " How 's your tooth ? " " Okay , " said Jeff . " Did you have a good time at the movies ? " Tony asked his mother . " What was playing ? " " I . . . I did n't go , " Lucy said . " I found out that they only showed them on week-ends . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go ? " " I did a little shopping , " Lucy said . " For antiques . " " Did you buy anything ? " Tony asked . " No , " said Lucy . " Everything is too expensive . I just looked around . Jeff and I are going down to the hotel forp124a drink . Do you want to join us ? You can have a Coke . " " I 'm not thirsty , " Tony said . " Even so , " Lucy said . " I 'm not thirsty , " Tony repeated . Lucy went over to him and felt his forehead . " Are you all right ? " The boy twisted away . " I 'm fine , " he said . " I 'm just a little tired , " he explained vaguely . " The hayride . I missed my nap . I think I 'll just lie down for fifteen minutes . " Then , afraid that his mother would bustle over him , he smiled widely , disingenuously , at her . " Those hayrides are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He went in and lay down on his bed . He lay stiffly , with his eyes open , and when he heard his mother and Jeff walk past his window on the way down to the hotel bar , he counted up to five hundred slowly , one by one , and then went into the living room and called his father in Hartford.  |p125The  car was mud-spattered when it drove up to the cottageand the wipers had made two smeary crescents on the windshield , which gleamed dully in the reflection of the headlights off the wet trees . Oliver stopped the car and sat for a moment at the wheel , resting after the long drive in the rain . There was a light on in the cottage but Oliver saw no one moving within . He got out of the car , carrying his raincoat and a small overnight bag that he had thrown into the back of the car . He went in the front door . The room was empty . The only sound to be heard was the small drip of rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . There were newspapers scattered on the table in the middle of the room and a book was lying open , face down , on the couch . There were some chessmen scattered over the chessboard and two or three of the pieces had fallen to the floor . Some petals had drifted down from a bunch of peonies in a vase on the mantelpiece and had dropped onto the rug.  |p126Standing  there , looking at the empty room , Oliver thought , whenever she 's any place for five minutes she creates a small , unimportant disorder . Sometimes it gave him a sense of pleasure , of intimacy , of indulgent understanding , when he saw a room like that after Lucy had been in it . But tonight , after the long trip , he was annoyed by it . He took off his hat and rubbed his hands to warm them . There was no fire on the hearth . He looked at the clock on the mantelpiece . It was two minutes past eight . As always , Oliver had arrived exactly when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look for the bottle of whisky that was kept in the cupboard above the icebox . There were some dishes left in the sink from the afternoon'stea . Three cups , he noticed , three saucers , some plates with crumbs of chocolate cake . He took down the whisky and poured himself a drink . He did n't bother to put any water in it and went back into the living room and sat down wearily , sipping the drink , waiting . A moment later he heard footsteps on the porch . The door opened and Tony came in , wearing a slicker and a baseballcap . Tony stopped just inside the door . He seemed almost reluctant to come into the room . " Hello , Tony , " Oliver said , smiling at him . " Daddy , " Tony said . He approached Oliver as though to kiss him and stopped at a little distance from him . Oliver took off his cap and ruffled his hair gently in a slight affectionate movement . " You 're being pretty mysterious , Tony , " Oliver said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not telling me what was wrong on the phone . Insisting that I get up here exactly at eight o'clock . Telling me not to speak to your mother . " " You 're sure you did n't call her ? " Tony asked suspiciously . " I did n't call her , " Oliver said . There was no sense inp127telling Tony that he had tried to telephone en route from Waterbury , but that there had been a break in the line because of the rain and he had n't been able to get through . " She does n't know you 're here ? " Tony asked . " No , " Oliver said . " I came in the back way , as you said , during dinnertime . Tony , " he asked mildly , " are you sure you 're not reading too many comic books ? " " I do n't read any comic books , " Tony said . " You 've had me worried all day , " Oliver said gently . " I 'm sorry . " " Come over here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his . Tony took off his slicker and came slowly over to the chair and seated himself . Oliver sipped his drink . " Now  --  what is it ? " " Daddy , " Tony said in a low voice , " I want to go home . " " Oh . " Oliver looked pensively at his glass . " Why ? " Tony made a restless movement with his hands . " I 've had enough of this place . " " It 's done you a lot of good , Tony , " said Oliver . " You look very healthy and brown and Mother writes me that . . . " " I want to go home , " Tony said flatly . Oliver sighed . " Did you tell that to your mother ? " " No , " said Tony . " There 's no use talking to her . " Oliver nodded indulgently . " Ah , " he said , " you two'vehad a little argument . " " No . " Oliver took another sip of his drink . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With nobody , " he said . " Ca n't a fellow want to go home with his own father once in a while without everybody jumping on him ? " " Nobody 's jumping on you , Tony , " Oliver said reassuringly . " Only you have to expect people to ask you a questionor two when you make long-distance phone calls andp128give all sorts of mysterious instructions . Be reasonable , Tony . " " I am reasonable , " Tony said , sounding cornered . " I want to go home because I do n't want to be in the same place with Mother and Jeff . " Oliver put his glass down and spoke very gently . " What did you say , Tony ? " " I do n't want to stay here with Mother and Jeff . " " Why ? " " I ca n't tell you . " Oliver glanced sharply at the boy . He was sitting with his head bent , staring at his shoes , his hands plunged in his pockets , looking resentful and embarrassed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been on the level with each other , have n't we ? " " Yes . " " I 've always told you what was bothering me and you 've always told me , up to now , " Oliver said . " Am I right ? " " Yes . " " Have I ever promised you anything I did n't do for you , " Oliver asked . " No , " said Tony . " When you asked me questions , have I ever given you an untruthful answer ? " " No . " " When you began to get into that habit last summer of telling fancy stories , " Oliver said , " like saying you swam across the lake one afternoon when you could n't swim at all and saying that old Mr. Norton invited you out to his ranch in Wyoming for a month and was going to give you your own horse . . . " " That was just kid stuff , " Tony said . " I know . " Oliver nodded reasonably . " Did n't I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me those stories and not anyone else because I knew you were justp129having fun and using your imagination . But other people who did n't know you the way I did might have begun to think you could n't be trusted and that you told lies . " " I do n't tell stories any more , " Tony said . " Not to any-one . " " Of course , " said Oliver . " And even about your eyes  --  there were a couple of times in the beginning when it was awfully hard to tell you what was wrong and what the chances were . When you get to be a father , Tony , you 'll understand what it meant to me . " He stopped . " But I did it , " he said . " Did n't I ? " " Yes , " said Tony . " Do you know why I did it ? " " I think so . " Tony 's voice was down to a whisper now . " Because I wanted everything to be clear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time from now , when you 're a man as old as I am now , I want you to be able to say , no matter what else happens in your life , There was honor between my father and me . ' " Oliver leaned over and patted Tony 's knee . Then he stood up , walked over to the front door and looked out into the wet night . Tony raised his head and stared at his father 's back , his lips trembling . He waited for Oliver to say something more , but Oliver remained quiet and Tony got up and crossed and stood next to him . " I do n't know how to say it , " he whispered . " Mother and Jeff . . . They 're doing something wrong . They 're doing what grownups do when they 're married . I want to go home . " Oliver closed his eyes momentarily . He had n't known what to expect after Tony 's call , but he had n't expected this . He 'd told himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day , that it was just some child 's crisis that would probably be over by the time he arrived . He would n't even have come up , really , if things had n't beenp130slow at the plant this week . Now  --  he thought , this is something different . This is like hearing cries from the nursery and going in thinking you are going to separate two childrenwho 'd hit each other with pillows or toys and finding , upon opening the door , one child lying in a pool of blood and the other standing over him with a knife in his hand . " Who told you that , Tony ? " he asked . " Susan , " Tony said . " Who 's Susan ? " " She 's here with her mother at the hotel . Susan Nickerson . She 's fourteen years old . She has three fathers . Her mother was divorced twice . She knows a lot of things . " " Is that why you asked me to come up here , Tony ? " Oliver asked . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " he said . " Tony , " Oliver said , choosing his words meticulously , " in a place like this in the summertime there are often idle women , women of bad character , women who have nothing else to do but sit and play bridge and make up stories about their neighbors , stories that a decent person must n't even listen to . And often little girls of fourteen who are just beginning to become interested in boys hear bits and scraps that are not meant for them and build them up into . . . uh . . . colorful fairy tales . Especially a little girl whose mother has gone from husband to hus-band . " " I hit her , " Tony said . " I hit Susan when she told me . " Oliver smiled . " I do n't think you should have hit her . But I do n't think you should have listened to her either . Tony , will you do me a favor ? " " What ? " His voice was suspicious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Oliver . " Or to Jeff . We 'll just pretend that I suddenly found out I could have some time off and I jumped intop131the car and came up here . Do n't you think that 's a good idea ? " Tony moved away as though he were in pain . " No . " " Why not ? " Oliver asked . " Because Susan was n't the only one . " Oliver put his arm around the boy 's shoulders : " Just becausetwo or three or a hundred people gossip , " he said , " does n't mean they 're saying the truth . Do you know what gossip is ? " " Yes , " said Tony . " It 's one of the worst things in the world , " said Oliver . " It 's a grownup disease . And one way a good man remains a child all his life is that he does n't gossip and he does n't listen to gossip . " Suddenly Tony pulled away from his father 's grasp . " It 's me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to his sister 's house yesterdayand I looked through the window and I saw with my own eyes . " He turned and , almost running , went across the room and flung himself into the easy chair , burying his face away from Oliver , into the wing . He was crying , racked by the effort of pretending he was not crying . Oliver ran his hand wearily across his eyes and walked over to the easy chair and sat on the arm . " All right , all right now . " He stroked the boy 's head . " Tony , I hate to have to do this . But I do n't know what else I can do . You 're very young . I do n't know what you know and what you do n't know . You might see something you think is very wrong and it could be completely innocent . Tony , " he said , " you must tell me exactly what you saw . " Tony spoke without turning his head , into the crease of the chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Susan was right . She was n't in the movies . I went down to his sister 's house . She 's not here this week and there 's no/body in the house . There 're Venetian blinds on the windows . They do n't come all the way down . There 's a little space at the bottom and you can look in . They were in bed together and they . . . they did n't have any clothes on . And Mummy was kissing . . . " Tony swung around and faced his father . " I want to go home . . . I want to go home . " Now he wept , inconsolably and openly . Oliver sat on the arm of the chair , rocklike , taut , watching his son weep . " Stop crying , Tony , " he said in a hoarse whisper . " You have n't cried since you were a little boy . " He stood up and pulled Tony out of the chair . " Go in now and wash your face , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? " Tony asked . Oliver shook his head . " I do n't know , " he said . " You 're not going away , are you ? " " No , " said Oliver . " I 'll just sit out here for a while . Go ahead , Tony . Your eyes are all red . " Slowly , his feet shuffling along the floor , Tony went into the bathroom . Oliver watched him go and shook his head vaguely . He walked heavily and pointlessly around the chilly room . There was a straw handbag with a bright orange scarf tossed over it that Lucy had left on a chair . He stopped in front of the chair and picked up the scarf . He put the scarf to his face and sniffed the perfume that Lucy had put on it . He bent again and opened the bag and rummaged in it . There was a small compact there and he opened it . The powder was spilled all over the mirror . He put the compact on the table and neatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with absent precision arranged them on the table . There was a tiny bottle of perfume , a bunch of keys , a comb . A clipping from a newspaperof a recipe . The recipe was for angel-food cake . He took out a small coin purse . He opened the purse and took the coins out of it and made a neat little pile of the coins . They came to seventy-eight cents . Then he methodicallyp133put all the things back into the bag , one by one . He heard voices , Lucy 's and Jeff 's , outside the cottage , and their footsteps on the porch and he composed his face and turned toward the door as it swung open . Lucy came in , followed by Jeff . She was laughing . When she saw Oliver standing in the middle of the room , the shadow of a frown crossed her face . Then she said , " Oliver , " sounding pleased and surprised , and ran across the room to throw her arms around him and kiss him . Tactfully , Jeff waited at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cheek . " Hello , Lucy , " he said pleasantly . " What are you doing here ? " Lucy bubbled on . " Why did n't you telephone ? How long are you going to stay ? Have you had your dinner ? What a lovely surprise ! Have you seen Tony ? " Oliver chuckled . " Easy now , " he said . " One thing at a time . Hello , Bunner . " " Welcome , Mr. Crown , " Jeff said with boyish politeness , standing very straight . Lucy took Oliver 's hand and led him to the couch . " Come over here and sit down , " she said . " You look tired . Can I get you something ? A drink ? A sandwich ? " " Nothing , " said Oliver . " I ate on the road . " Jeff looked at his watch . " It 's getting late , " he said . " I guess I might as well be moving on . " " Oh , no . Please stay , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him uneasily or not . " There are a few things I 'd like to talk to you about . Unless you 're busy . " " No , " said Jeff . " I 'm not busy . " " Have you seen Tony ? " Lucy asked . " Yes , " said Oliver . " He 's inside . In the bathroom . " " Does n't he look marvelous ? " Lucy asked . Oliver nodded . " Marvelous. "  | " Did I tell you he swam a hundred yards this week ? " Lucy asked . She seemed to Oliver to be speaking more quickly than he remembered , like a pianist who is sufferingfrom an attack of nerves before an audience and to make up for it finds himself going faster and faster through the difficult passages . " Way , way out on the lake , " Lucy said . " With Jeff following him in a boat . My heart was in my mouth and . . . " " I just talked to him for a minute , " Oliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you taking all your meals at the hotel now ? " " This week , " Lucy broke in hastily before Jeff could reply . " His sister 's away this week and the poor boy was faced with two cans of salmon and we took pity on him . " " Oh , I see . " Oliver smiled . " You both look as though the summer has agreed with you . " " It has n't been too bad , " Lucy said . " It 's rained a lot , though . Now what about you ? How 'd you manage to break away ? Did all those charming people in the plant go on strike all of a sudden ? " " Nothing as lively as that , " Oliver said . " I just managed to sneak some time off . " " It 's been awful in the city , has n't it ? " Lucy asked . " Oh , not so bad . " Lucy patted his hand . " We missed you so . Tony asked when you could come . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I do n't know , " Oliver said . " That depends . " " Oh , " said Lucy . " Depends . " She wandered back towardthe little hall that led to the bedrooms and called , " Tony ! Tony ! " " Leave him alone , please , " Oliver said . " I 'd like to talk to you , Lucy . " Jeff , still standing near the door , coughed , a little awkwardly . " In that case , " he said , " I 'd better . . . "  | " And to you too , Jeff , if you do n't mind , " Oliver said pleasantly . " Would you think I was rude if I asked you to wait down by the lake for a few minutes ? I see it 's stopped raining . I 'd like to speak to my wife alone and then  --  if it 's all right with you I 'll call you . " " Of course , " said Jeff easily . " Take as long as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Jeff went out the door . Lucy felt her mouth get dry and she wanted to call toJeff , " Stay ! Stay ! Give me time ! " But she watched him go out , and then , trying to swallow , to restore the moisture in her mouth and throat , she made herself go over to Oliver . She was almost sure she was smiling , as she put her arms around him . The important thing , at this moment , she thought , is to be normal . What would be normal , though ? She had a flicker of panic , at the impossibility of knowing what normal was . " It 's so good to see you again , " she said . " It 's been such a long time . " Normal . To give herself something to do , to prolong time , she made herself examine Oliver 's face closely . The long , hard , familiar face , the pale , clever , knowing eyes , the set , pale mouth , so surprisingly soft when he kissed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She touched , with the tips of her fingers , the marks of fatigue under his eyes . " You look so tired . " " Stop saying I look tired , " Oliver said with a first little flash of anger . Lucy moved away from him . Everything I am going to do , she thought , is going to be wrong . " I 'm sorry , " she said in a small voice . " You said your staying here depends  --  On what ? " " On you . " " Oh . " Lucy clenched her hands , unconsciously , squeezingher fingers . " On me ? "  |p136Suddenly  the light was too bright in the room and everythingstood out too clearly , the sharp , ugly lines of the table , the hideous yellow of the drapes , the worn drab spots on the arms of the easy chair . Everything was angular and hurtful and time was moving too fast , like a train going downhill into a tunnel . How wonderful it would be if she could faint , if she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm , protective haze for the hard thing that was ahead of her . It 's unfair , she thought confusedly , the most important act of my life , and nobody gives me time to get ready for it . " You know what I would like , " she said lightly , still almostsure she was smiling , " I would like a drink and . . . " Oliver reached over and took her wrist . " Come here , Lucy . " He led her to the couch . " Sit down . " They sat down next to each other . This is the millionth time , she thought , we have sat next to each other . Lucy laughed , letting things happen , not trying to guide them . " My , you 're serious , " she said . " Very serious , " Oliver said . " Oh . " Lucy 's voice was small , domestic , apologetic . " Have I spent too much money ? Did I overdraw at the bank again ? " There , that was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it happen . " Lucy , " Oliver said , " have you been having an affair ? " Let it happen . Say the normal thing . He was sitting there like a teacher in school , asking her questions , gradingher . Suddenly she realized that she had been afraid of him for fifteen years , every minute for fifteen years . " What ? " she asked , proud of the tone of amusement and incredulity in her voice . This is only temporary , she thought . Later on , when we have more time , we will talkp137seriously . Later on , we will lead up to the permanent truth . " An affair , " Oliver was saying . Lucy wrinkled her forehead , looking puzzled , as if Oliver had presented her with a riddle , but a riddle she was prepared to enjoy , once she understood its intent . " With whom ? " she asked . " Bunner , " Oliver said . For a moment Lucy seemed stupefied . Then she began to laugh . Somewhere inside me , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , who makes the correct noise and gives the correct answer to all questions . All I have to do is mimic her automatically . " Oh , my , " Lucy said . " With that child ? " Oliver watched her closely , already almost convinced because he was so ready to be convinced . " You must get over your habit of thinking men are children until they reach the age of fifty , " he said mildly . " Poor Jeff . " Lucy was still laughing . " He 'd be so proud if he could hear you . Why , " she said , feeling her face frozen in the difficult lines of laughter and inventing spontaneouslyand without plan , " why , all last winter he was going to dances with a girl who 's still in high school in Boston . She 's a cheer leader . She wears those short skirts and does somersaults at the high-school football games every Saturday afternoon and they ca n't go to bars when they have dates because none of the bartenders will serve them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sought and found the proper tone of incredulous amusement . It 's like a dive , she thought . Once you start , there 's no turning back , no matter how high it suddenly seems , or how deep the water below , or how frightened you are or how much you regret having started . " Is that why you came up here like this ? " she asked  | " Yes , " said Oliver . " That long , long ride all alone , " said Lucy pityingly . The middle of the dive , going through the air , balancing . " Poor Oliver . Still , if that 's the only way I can get you up here , I 'm satisfied . " Then she spoke more seriously . " Now how did you happen to get an idea like that ? What happened ? Did you get an anonymous poison-pen letter from one of those old hens up in the hotel ? I have nothing to do with them and I suppose that annoys them . They see me and Tony and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scandal to munch on and . . . " I did n't get any anonymous letters , " Oliver said . " No ? " Lucy challenged him . " Then what ? " " It 's Tony , " said Oliver . " He called nze last night . He asked me to come up here . " " Oh , " said Lucy . " And you did n't call me back ? " " He asked me not to , " said Oliver . " So that 's why he rushed away from dinner . So that 's why you came at this odd hour , " she said sardonically . " For the secret rendezvous of the males of the family . " " Well , the truth is , " Oliver said , on the defensive , " I did try to call from Waterbury , but the line was out this afternoon . He did n't tell me anything on the phone . He was almost hysterical . He kept saying he had to see me alone . " " I . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impeccablemodel within her . " Of you . Of Tony . Myself . Our marriage . " " What would you have done ? " Oliver said miserably . " If Tony had called you and said that I . . . " " What have I always done ? " Lucy said quickly . " There 's never been anything with me , " Oliver said . " You know that . " " No ? Maybe not , " Lucy said . " Who 's to know ? I have n't asked . Still  --  is that the only thing in the world ? Is that the only problem that people who 've been married for fifteenp139years have to face ? Have I ever lied to you ? Have I ever hidden anything from you ? " " No , " Oliver said wearily , and Lucy had the feeling that he was almost ready to let the whole matter drop . " Suddenly , " she said , speaking swiftly , pressing her advantage , " everything changes . Now is the time for conspiracyand secret visits and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All right , " Oliver said . " I admit  --  I should have called . But it still does n't answer the question . Why did Tony tell me what he did ? " " How do I know ? " Lucy said . " I do n't even know what he told you . " " Lucy , " said Oliver gently , " he said he saw you and the young man in his sister 's house . " End of dive . Lucy took in her breath with a long sighing noise . " Oh . He said that ? " " Yes . " She spoke in a flat , dead voice . " What exactly did he say he saw ? " " I ca n't repeat it , Lucy . " " You ca n't repeat it , " she said , her voice still lacking in timbre . " No , " said Oliver , " but unhappily , it was most con-vincing . " " Oh . . . I 'm so sorry . " Lucy bent over and he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was going to confess . " Mostly for Tony , " she said . Mistake . The dive was not over . Because it was n't a real dive . It was a descent in a dream , whirling , grabbing handfuls of air . " Listen , Oliver , " she said soberly . " There 're several things you ought to know about your son . Not such pleasant things . You know how he makes up stories ? Let 's use the exact word . Lies . How many times have we pleaded with him ? "  | " He 's stopped that , " said Oliver . " That 's what you think , " said Lucy . " It 's just that the stories become more clever as he grows older . More ingenious , more believable , less innocent . " " I thought he was getting over that , " Oliver said . " That 's because you do n't know him . You see him a few hours a week when he 's on his best behavior . You do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been with him day and night for years . " Arson , she thought , horrified with herself . Once you light the match , there 's nothing to do but stand back and watch the house burn down . And deny everything and solidify the alibi . " That 's why this has happened , " she said . " The truth is he does n't behave with me like a normal little boy . He behaves like a jealous , possessivelover . You said so yourself . " " Not really , " Oliver said . " Not seriously . As a joke maybe  --  " " It 's not a joke , " said Lucy . " You know how he acts when he comes into the house and I 'm not there . He prowls around , looking for me . He telephones my friends . He goes to my bedroom and stands at the window waiting , not saying a word to anyone . You 've seen it dozens of times , have n't you ? " " Yes . And I never liked it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too much . That 's one of the reasons why I hired Bunner . " " And then you told me to leave him alone more , " said Lucy rapidly . " To let him spend more time by himself . To force him to be independent . And you told Jeff the same things . Well , we followed instructions . Your instructions . And this is the result . " " What do you mean ? " Oliver asked , confused . " We left him alone from time to time , " Lucy said . " We carefully avoided making him the center of things everyp141minute of the day . And he hated it . And this is his revenge . This sick , unpleasant little story . " Oliver shook his head . " No little boy can make up a story like that . " " Why not ? " Lucy asked . " Especially now . Among other instructions you left you prescribed a course in sex for him . " " What 's wrong with that ? It 's about time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together his jealousy and allthis interesting new information and try to destroy us withit . " Lucy , " Oliver said , " are you telling the truth ? " Lucy took a deep breath , raised her head and stared directly into Oliver 's eyes . " I swear it , " she said . Oliver turned and went to the door and opened it . " Bunner , " he called to the boy at the edge of the lake . " Bunner . " " What are you going to do ? " Lucy asked . " I want to talk to him . " Oliver came back into the room . " You ca n't , " Lucy said . " I have to , " Oliver said gently . " You ca n't embarrass me like that . You ca n't embarrassyourself . You must n't degrade me in front of that boy . " " I 'd like to talk to him alone , please , " Oliver said . " If you do this , " said Lucy , " I 'll never forgive you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because it was what theautomatic , innocent wife would have said . Oliver made a short gesture of dismissal . " Please , Lucy . " They were standing there facing each other tensely when Bunner came into the room . Oliver saw him finally . " Oh , yes , " he said , " you 're here . " He turned back to his wife . " Lucy , " he said , waiting . Without looking at Jeff she walked swiftly to the door and went out . After a moment , Oliver visibly braced himself , then gestured politely to Jeff.  | " Sit down , " he said . Jeff hesitated , then sat on a wooden chair . Oliver walked slowly back and forth in front of him as he spoke . " First , " he said , " I want to thank you for the letters you 've been writing every week reporting on Tony 's progress . " " Well , " Jeff said , " since you could n't get up here I thought you 'd like to know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters , " said Oliver . " They were very shrewd . You seemed to know what was going on with Tony all the time and I got the feeling you really liked him a great deal too . " " He 's a rewarding little boy , " said Jeff . " Rewarding ? " Oliver repeated vaguely , as though this was a new concept of his son . " Yes , is n't he ? The letters gave me quite a good picture of yourself incidentally . " Jeff laughed a little self-consciously . " They did ? I hope I did n't give myself away . " " Quite the opposite , " said Oliver . " I got the picture of a most intelligent , decent young man . I even began to feel that , after college , if you might somehow change your mind about diplomacy , I might try to find something for you in my business . " " It 's very nice to hear , Sir , " Jeff said , embarrassedly . " I 'll remember it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it would have been impolite to get to the main question too soon and he was casting about , looking for subjects of conversation , " that girl of yours you talked about the day I met you . I even remember your exact words . I asked you if you had a girl and you said , approximately . Is she by any chance still in Boston , in high school ? " " In high school ? " Jeff asked , puzzled . " Yes , " said Oliver . " Cheer leader for the high-school football team ? "  |p143Jeff  laughed uneasily . " No , " he said . " I do n't know any high-school girls in Boston . And certainly no cheer leaders . The girl I was talking about is a junior at Vassar and actuallyI was boasting . I do n't see her more than five or six times a year . Why do you ask ? " " I must have gotten a little mixed up , " Oliver said easily . " Maybe it was something in one of Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for speculation . " He shrugged . " It 's of no importance . So  --  no cheer leaders . " " Not a one , " said Jeff . Oliver waited . " How about older ladies ? " he said evenly . " Married ladies ? " Jeff dropped his eyes . " I do n't think you really expect me to answer that , Mr. Crown . " " No , perhaps not . " Oliver took out his checkbook and pen from his pocket . " Has Mrs. Crown paid you regularly every week ? " " Yes , " said Jeff . " She has n't paid you this week ? " Oliver asked , with the checkbook open . " No , " said Jeff . " Now wait a minute , Sir . " " This is Friday , " Oliver went on calmly , " and the arrangementwas thirty dollars for a seven-day week , was n't it ? That would be five-sevenths of thirty  --  well , let 's say roughly twenty-one dollars as a flat sum . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little short on cash . " Jeff stood up . " I do n't want any money , " he said . Oliver raised his eyebrows . " Why not ? " he asked . " You took it each week from Mrs. Crown , did n't you ? " " Yes . But . . . " Why should this week be any different ? " Oliver sounded good-tempered and reasonable . " Except that it 's two days short ? " " I do n't want it , " Jeff said . Oliver purposely misunderstood him . " Things being asp144they are , " he said , " you do n't think that you ought to stay on any longer , do you ? " " No , " Jeff said , mumbling so low that Oliver could hardly hear him . " Of course not , " Oliver said , in a fatherly tone . He gave Jeff the check . " Here , take it . You 've earned it . I remember when I was your age I could always use twenty dollars . It ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhappily at the check in his hand and started toward the door . Then he turned back . " I suppose I ought to say I 'm sorry or ashamed or something like that . I suppose it would make you feel better . " Oliver smiled warmly . " Not necessarily , " he said . " Well , I 'm not , " Jeff said defiantly . " It 's the greatest thing that ever happened to me . " Oliver nodded . " It always is , " he said . " At the age of twenty . " " You do n't know , " Jeff said incoherently . " You do n't know her . " " Perhaps not , " Oliver said . " She 's pure , " Jeff said . " Delicate . You must n't blame her . I did it . It 's all my fault . " " I do n't want to take any of the glory away from you , " Oliver said pleasantly , " but I must say that when a thirtyfive-year-oldwoman takes up with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than being present . " " You . . . " said Jeff bitterly , confronting the older man . " You 're so sure of yourself . I know all about you . She 's told me . Sitting back . Telling everybody what they 're to do . What they 're to think . The people who work for you . Your child . Your wife . Having everything your own way . Being polite and frozen and ruthless . God , even now you do n't even have the grace to be angry . You come up here and find out I 'm in love with your wife and what do you do ? You sign a check . " With a melodramatic gesture he crumpledthe check and threw it on the floor . Oliver 's air of indulgence , of amusement , did not change . " It 's one of the arguments you always hear , " he said , " against hiring the sons of wealthy families . They do n't have the proper respect for money . " " I hope she leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does , I 'll marry her . "  | " Bunner , " Oliver said , repressing a smile , " if I may say so , you 're behaving like a fool . You 're being sentimental . You use words like love , marriage , delicacy , purity , and I know why , and I even admire you for it . You 're not a brute . You want to have a high opinion of yourself . You want to think of yourself as passionate , exceptional . Well , it 's naturalenough , and I do n't blame you for it  --  but I have to tell you that it does n't square with the facts . " " What do you know about the facts ? " Jeff asked bitterly . " This much , " Oliver said . " You have n't had a love affair . You 've had a work of the imagination . You 've imagined a woman who does n't exist , an emotion that does n't exist . " " Do n't tell me , " Jeff started to interrupt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " You 've taken something that 's routine and casual and you 've larded it with roses and moonlight . You 've mistaken a season for a lifetime . You 've mistaken a silly , childish woman 's easy conscience for passion , and finally , you 'll be the one who gets hurt the worst because of it . " " If that 's the way you feel about her , " Jeff said , almost stuttering in his anger and confusion , " you have no right to talk about her . You do n't respect her , you do n't admire her , you do n't love her . . . Oliver sighed . " When you get older , " he said , " you 'll find out that love very often has almost nothing to do with respect and admiration . Anyway , I did n't come all the wayp146up here to talk about me . Jeff , " he said , " let me ask you to do something fairly hard  --  look at things as they really are . Look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one . All the clapboard palaces with thin walls and bad dance bands and postcard lakes and lazy , thoughtless , vacationingwomen separated from their husbands for the hot months . Women who lie out in the sun all day , bored , restless , drinking too much , looking for amusement and finding it in traveling salesmen , waiters , hired athletes , trumpet players , college boys . The whole tribe of cheap , available males with only that to recommend them . That , and the fact that they conveniently vanish when the cold weather comes . By the way , " Oliver said conversationally , " have you talked to Mrs. Crown on the subject of mar-riage ? " " Yes . I did . " " What did she say ? " " She laughed , " Jeff admitted . " Of course . " Oliver was friendly and sympathetic . " The same thing happened to me when I was just past twenty . Except that it was on a boat , on the way to France . Actuallyit was perhaps even more romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to indicate the cottage , the lake , the surroundingforest . " Boats being what they are and France being what it was right after the war . And the lady was wise enough to leave her children at home , since she was perhapsmore practiced than Mrs. Crown . It was very intense . It even included a two-week trip to the Italian lakes and adjoining cabins on the old Champlain and I made speeches to her on the boatdeck on the way " back to America that I imagine were very much like some of the speeches you must have been making here on moonlit nights . And we were luckier , too . The husband never knew anything . Never appeared until we docked . Even so , " Oliver laughed reflectively , " it took two hours to get through customs and byp147the time we were through the gate she was having trouble remembering my name . " " Why are you trying to make it so ugly ? " said Jeff . " Why does that make it better for you ? " " Not ugly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that summer in Europe is one of the most agreeable memoriesI have  --  but ordinary . Do n't be so unhappy because at a certain age you happen to have gone through an experience that other young men have had before you . " He bent down and picked up the crumpled check frofn the floor . " You 're sure you do n't want this check ? " He held it out , offering it to the boy . " No , " said Jeff . Oliver shrugged . " Whatever you say . As you get older , you learn to treat money more carefully , too . " He smoothed out the check , looked at it absently , then with a sudden movement threw it into the fireplace . " Incidentally  --  thatphonograph is yours , is n't it ? " " Yes , " said Jeff . " I think you 'd better take it with you , " Oliver said . " Now . And anything else around here that belongs to you . " " That 's all there is , " said Jeff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plug . He wrapped the cord neatly around the instrument and tucked the plug firmly through the twist of wire . " I think you 'd better stay away from here from now on , do n't you ? " " I 'm not making any promises . " Oliver shrugged . " It makes no difference to me . I was merely thinking of your own peace of mind . " He tapped the phonograph . " Here we are . " He waited , smiling pleasantly . Jeff , his face set , came over and put the machine under his arm and started out . As he got to the door it opened and Lucy came in.  |p148After  Lucy had left the house , she walked blindly down toward the lake . She stopped at its edge , staring out across the water . The clouds had parted a little and there was pale , wet moonlight picking out the tips of branches , the pilings at the end of the hotel dock , a mast on one of the small sailboats tied a few feet off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the water , and Lucy shivered . She had n't put on a sweater and she could n't go back into the house now and get one . She thought of what the two men were saying to each other in the living room . She tried to imagine the conversation , but it was impossible . In other times and other places , men had killed each other in situations like this . Not only in other times . She remembered a story she had read in a newspaper a month or so ago . A sailor had come home unexpectedly and found his wife with another man and had shot them both . Then he had shot himself . It had been all over the front pages for two days . Well , nobody was going to shoot anybody else in the living room . Maybe that was what was wrong with them . All three of them . Maybe something like this was only valid and worthwhile if people were willing to shoot each other as a consequence . She turned and looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked all summer and the summer before . The light streaming peacefully , too brightly , through the curtains of the living-room window , making the wet grass gleam on the lawn in front of the house . And several windows away , the light was on in Tony 's room , shaded , from the lamp on his desk . She wondered what Tony was doing . Reading ? Drawing his pictures of horses , boats and athletes ? Packing , preparing to run away ? Listening ? She shivered . Suddenly , she knew that the worst thing was going to be facing Tony , whether he was listening orp149not . She turned away from the house and looked out across the lake . How easy it would be just to walk out and keep going , out into the blackness , out into the simple blackness . . . Well , she knew she was n't going to do that , either . She listened to the tapping of the water against the dockpilings , small , monotonous , familiar , the same sound as last summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was last summer . She wished it was any time before tonight . With everything to be done over again , and done better and more wisely , not with that insane , rushing , diving , automatic , dreamlike inventiveness . Or next summer , with everything settled , forgotten , punished . She wished that they could go back a half-hour , to the moment when she came into the house and saw Oliver standing there , and knowing it was going to be bad , and being frightened of him and at the same time feeling that sensation of warmth and gladness that she always felt when she saw him after being away from him for some time , a sensation of rootedness , familiarity , connection , a subtle , comfortable relinquishment of the responsibility of being alone . She wondered if she could ever explain that feeling to Oliver , and explain that it could exist at the same time that she was making love with another man , at the same time that she was lying to him about it , at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What she should have done when Oliver sent Jeff out of the room and accused her , was to get up and say , " Please give me fifteen minutes alone . I want to arrange everything exactly , correctly , in my mind , because this is too important to rush . " Then she should have gone into her own room , by herself , and thought it all out and come back and begged for forgiveness . Only she had n't done that . She had behaved instinctively , like a guilty child , in a gush and brainless female flurry of tricks , thinking only of protecting herself for the moment ,  |p150no  matter what losses it would mean later on . Instinctively , she thought . Well , my instincts are no damned good . When she went back into the house , she decided , she was going to make it all up . She was going to be calm and sensibleand she was going to say , " Please forget everything I said tonight . Now , this is the way it happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see Jeff again . She would keep the promise , too . It would be easy  --  because as soon as she had seen Oliver and Jeff together , in the same room , Jeff had vanished , he had become nothing , he had become once more just a nice little boy who was hired to teach her son how to swim and to keep him out of mischief for a few weeks in the summertime . If only Oliver had n't been so stubborn , she thought , with a little twinge of anger against him , if only he had taken her home with him when she 'd asked him to , in July , none of this would have happened . If he had n't complained that night over the phone about that garage bill . Let him take some of the blame , too . Let him understand that there were consequences for him , too , in always making other people do what he wanted them to do . Let him understand that she was a human being , not a block to be pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feelings were signposts , danger-signals , appeals , and were to be considered . Maybe this was all to the good , she thought  --  this event  --  this , this accident . Maybe , she thought optimistically , this will shake our marriage into its proper final shape . Maybe from now on , the rights and privileges and decisions will be more equally divided . She saw shadows moving across the light , behind the living-room curtains and she wondered what the two men were saying about her , who was attacking her , who defending , what judgments they were reaching about her , what revelations , criticisms , what plans for her future . Suddenly , it was intolerable to think of them alone together ,  |p151debating  her , exposing her , settling her . No matter what happens , she thought , it is going to happen in my presence . She hurried across the wet grass and into the house . When she opened the door , she saw Jeff standing there , in the middle of the room , with his phonograph under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defeated and unimportant , and she knew immediately that whatever Oliver had wanted from him he had got . Oliver was standing on the other side of the room , impassiveand polite . Lucy glanced once at Jeff , then turned to Oliver . " Are you through ? " " I believe so , " Oliver said . " Lucy . . . " Jeff began . " Go ahead , Jeff , " she said . She was still holding the door open . Miserably , looking disciplined , Jeff went out , the bulk of the phonograph under his arm making him walk awkwardly . Oliver watched him leave . Then he lit a cigarette deliberately , conscious that Lucy , standing rigidly near the door now , was following his every movement . " Quite a nice young man , " Oliver said finally . " Quite nice . " I ca n't go through with it , Lucy thought . Not tonight . Not while he 's standing there , looking amused . Not while he 's patronizing and in control . She felt herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do while she was out at the edge of the lake . All she knew was that she had to get through the next ten minutes somehow , anyhow . " Well ? " Lucy asked . Oliver smiled wearily at her . " He seems . . . very attached to you . " " What did he say ? " Lucy demanded . " Oh  --  the usual , " said Oliver . " I do n't understand you.  |p152You  're pure and delicate . It was all his fault . He 's glad it happened . It 's the greatest thing in his life . He wants to marry you . Very gallant . No surprises . " " He 's lying , " Lucy said . " Now , Lucy , " said Oliver . He made a tired small movement of his hand . " He 's lying , " Lucy repeated , stubbornly . " He 's a crazy boy . He was up here last summer . I never even met him . But he followed me around , watching . Never saying a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , speaking very quickly in an attempt to overwhelm Oliver , to keep him from interrupting . " Then this summer , " she said , " he came up just because he found out I was going to be here . Then one night I did something foolish . I admit it . It was silly . I let him kiss me . And it all came out . How he was in love with me from the first minute he saw me . How he followed me . How he wrote me dozens of letters during the winter and did n't mail them . How he could n't bear not to be near me . All the childish , extravagant things . I was going to call and tell you about it . But I kept thinking , if I told you you 'd be worried . Or you 'd make a scene . Or you 'd think it was a trick on my part to get rid of him . Or you 'd make fun of me for not being able to handle a boy like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her  --  always needing help and not being able to take care of herself like everybody else . I kept thinking , It 's only for six weeks , it 's only for six weeks . I kept him off . I used every trick I knew . I ridiculed him . I was bored , I was angry , I suggested other girls . But he was always there . Always saying , Eventually . But nothing happened . Nothing . " " That is n't his story , Lucy , " Oliver said quietly . " No , of course not . He wants to make trouble . He told me himself . Once he even told me he was going to write you and say we were lovers so that you 'd kick me out andp153I 'd have to turn to him . What can I do to make you believe me ? " " Nothing , " Oliver said . " Because you 're a liar . " " No , " Lucy said . " Do n't say that . " " You 're a liar , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her defenses overrun and all pretense suddenly abandoned , she walked blindly toward him , her arms out in front of her . " No . . . please , Oliver . . . " " Keep away from me , " Oliver said . " That 's the worst part . The lies . The unforgivable part . After a while , maybe I could forget your summertime college boy . But the lies ! Especially the lie about Tony . Good God , what were you trying to do ? What kind of a woman are you ? " Lucy slumped into a chair , her head down . " I did n't know what I was doing , " she said dully . " I 'm so scared , Oliver . I 'm so scared . I want so much to save us , both of us , our marriage . " " God damn such marriages , " Oliver said . " Lying in his . arms , laughing about me , complaining . Telling him betweenkisses that I was cold , I was a tyrant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you were too eager to jump into bed to make sure the blinds were drawn properly . " Lucy moaned . " It was n't like that . " Oliver was standing over her now , raging . " Is that the marriage you 're so anxious to save ? " " I love you , " she whispered , her head still down , not looking at Oliver . " I love you . " " Am I supposed to be melted by that ? " Oliver asked . " Am I supposed to say now that it 's all right that you'velied to me for fifteen years and all right that you 're goingto lie to me for the next fifteen ? Just because , when you'vebeen found out , you 're brazen enough to say you love me ? " " This is the first time , " Lucy said hopelessly . " I neverp154lied to you before . I swear it . I do n't know what happened to me . You should n't have left me alone . I begged you not to . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . I told him I was n't going to see him again . You can ask him . " Suddenly Oliver picked up his hat and coat and overnightbag . Frightened , Lucy looked up . " Where are you going ? " " I do n't know , " Oliver said . " I 'm getting out of here . " Lucy stood up , putting out her hand toward him . " I 'll promise anything , " she said . " I 'll do anything . Please do n't leave me . Please do n't . " " I 'm not leaving you yet , " Oliver said . " I have to get off by myself till I can decide what to do . " " Will you call me ? " Lucy asked . " Will you come back ? " Oliver took a deep breath . He sounded exhausted . " We 'll see , " he said . He went out of the cottage and a moment later Lucy heard the car start . She stood in the middle of the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine . The door from the hallway was flung open and Tony came into the room . " Where 's Daddy ? " he asked harshly . " I heard the car . Where did he go ? " " I do n't know , " Lucy said . She put out her hand to touch Tony 's shoulder , but he pulled away and rushed onto the porch . She could hear him running down the road , his voice growing smaller and smaller , calling after his father , and the noise of the car diminishing and then vanishing in the distance.  |p155For  the next ten days and nights , Oliver kept to himself as much as he could , spending as little time as possible in his office and avoiding all his friends . He gave the colored maid the time off , telling her that he was going to eat out , and she went down to Virginia to visit her family , leaving him alone in the house . Each night , after coming home from the office , Oliver prepared his dinner and ate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Then he neatly washed the dishes and went into the living room and sat in front of the fireplace until one or two o'clock in the morning , not reading , not turning on the radio , but merely sitting there , staring at the cold swept hearth until he felt tired enough to go to sleep . He did n't call or write Lucy . When he finally got in touch with her , he wanted to know exactly what he was going to do . All his life Oliver had come to decisions unhurriedly , after long and thoughtful examination . Hep156was n't a vain man , but he was n't modest , either , and he believed in his intelligence and his ability to reach conclusionsthat would stand up to the test of events . Now he had to come to a conclusion about his wife and his son and himself and he gave himself time and solitude for the process . The process was long and more difficult than he had imagined it would be , because instead of reasoning out the problem , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their voices , the low laughter in the darkened room , and the intolerable gestures of love . At those moments , alone in the empty house , he was tempted to write Lucy and tell her it was all over and that he never wanted to see her again . But he did n't write the letter . Perhaps in a week or two , the letter would be written , but it would come as a result of severe reflection , not as a result of selftorment . He had given himself this time to regain control of himself ; when the control was re-established , complete , he would act . His jealousy , if that was what it was , hit him harder than it might have hit another man , who was accustomed to being jealous . The jealous man secretly believes in his own betrayal . He is in a state of siege and is convinced that somehow , somewhere , the wall will be breached , and makes his pessimistic adjustments beforehand to cope with his defeat . Oliver had never imagined that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the first few days , disarmed and overrun . Curiously , he thought of what other men must have done in similar situations . After all , it was a common enough phenomenon . What were the lines of Leontes ? " There have beenOr I am much deceived , cuckolds ere now , And many a man there is , even at this present ,  |p157Now  , while I speak this , holds his wife by the arm , That little thinks she has been sluiced in ' s absence . . . " He did n't remember the rest of the speech , but he rememberedit was apposite . He got up and took down a big volume of Shakespeare 's plays and opened it to The Winter'sTale and thumbed through the pages until he found the passage . " Should all despair , " Oliver read , " That have revolted wives , the tenth of mankind Would hang themselves . Physic for ' t , there 's none ; It is a bawdy planet . " Oliver closed the book and put it down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it simpler than it was . A bawdy planet , the poet said , poetically , and that was explanationenough for him . After fifteen years of marriage , Oliver thought , this did n't explain Lucy to him . He tried to clarify for himself just what he did think of his wife . Reserved , devoted , moderate , he thought , anxious to please him and win his approval . Generally obedient , he thought , grinning sourly at the echo of the wedding ceremony , given only to the lesser sins of sentimentality , inefficiency , timidity . Necessary to him . Ten days ' reflection , he thought grimly , and it comes down to that . Necessary . I accepted her too lightly , he thought , as one reflects upon a friend who has died and whose value , too late , is suddenly appreciated . I was n't careful enough . He thought of what it would be like with just himself and Tony in the house . Tony , with his mother 's eyes , and the same delicate cheekbones , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his maleness and made cruder and a little comic by his awkwardness and adolescence.  |p158Whatever  else happens , Oliver thought , I could n't stand that . He tried to think of what it must be like now up at the lake , Tony and Lucy together day and night , confronting each other , after the rainy evening ten days ago . Oliver supposedthat he should have taken Tony home with him , for Tony 's sake . If he had n't rushed around like a stabbed bull , perhaps he would have done so . Only it would have made coming to a proper decision that much harder . Well , he comforted himself , let him have a rough week or so  --  in the long run , we 'll all profit by my being allowed to figure this out , undisturbed . Oliver got up to go to bed . He put out the light and went upstairs to the bedroom that he shared with Lucy . It was a big room with a bay window , looking out through the foliage of an oak tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each morning , turning it down so that it would be ready to sleep in at night . The room was neater than it ever was when Lucy was there , and it suddenly seemed artificial and unfamiliar to Oliver because of that . Lucy had left her silver-backed toilet articles on the dressingtable and the first morning that Oliver had done the housework , he had arranged all the things , the brushes , the combs and nail-files , the carved hand-mirror , in a severe geometric pattern on the glass surface . Now they seemed like articles put out for sale in the shop of a man without much imagination . Oliver went over to the table and lifted the mirror . It was heavy and the silver handle was cool and he remembered the hundreds of times he had watched Lucy , getting dressed to go out , holding the mirror up , her head twisted , to see the back of her head and make sure her hair was all right , and the small , soft indefinite movementswith which she pushed strands of hair in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which he had regarded her , pleased with her beauty , annoyed because she was taking so much time and making them late for wherever they were going , accomplishingnothing , as far as he could tell , with the hesitant , undecided movements of her hand . He threw the mirror down carelessly , changing the patternon the table . Then he put out the lamp and sat for a long time in the dark on the edge of the old bed . Reserved , devoted , moderate , he remembered . That 's what I thought . Shakespeare , no doubt , would have a differentopinion . And what about her own opinion of herself ? Lying next to him for so many years , plotting , resentful , mocking his estimate of her , cherishing other qualities , closing her eyes , turning secretly away from him in the same bed , the twisting , stubborn inhabitant of the bawdy planet . If I were another kind of man , he thought wearily , sitting fully dressed on the side of the bed in the dark room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this . I would drink or I would find another woman or I would do both . Then , satiated and loose , I 'd arrive , sidewise , and with less pain , at a decision . For a moment , he thought of getting into the car and driving to New York and registeringin a hotel there . Women would n't be hard to find in the city , and , in fact , there were one or two whom he knew who had made it plain that all he had to do was ask . But even as he turned it over in his head , he knew he would n't call anyone . He doubted , even , that he could manage to take another woman . He was a passionate man ; he knew he was much more avid than other men his age  --  but it had all been channeled into the one direction . This is a hell of a predicament , he thought , grinning malevolently to himself , for a uxorious man.  |p160What  a goddamn summer , he thought , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed . The next morning , there was a letter in the mail from Lucy . Oliver was just leaving the house when the postman came , and he stood at the door , in the warm , early sunshine , turning the envelope over in his hand , conscious of his neighbors setting out to work , saying good-bye to children , hurrying to catch trains and buses , moving through the greenness of trees and lawns , against a background of flowers , moving through the bright summer morning , the men already grayed over a little , Oliver thought , by the shadows of the offices and factories that were waiting for them . Oliver did n't open the letter immediately . He looked at the familiar inscription on the envelope  --  backhand , childish , not quite controlled , always a little hard to read . Where had he heard that that kind of handwriting , backhand , was evidence of repression , hypocrisy , self-consciousness ? He did n't remember it accurately . Perhaps it was another kind of handwriting and he 'd mixed it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books and look it up . He opened the envelope and read the letter . It was short and without apologies . All she said was that she was going to leave him , because she could n't bear living any longer in the same house with Tony and him . And when she signed it , she did n't say , Love , or anything like that . Just Lucy . There was no information about how Tony was , no inquiriesabout him or what he had decided , no hesitation or offers . It was like no letter she had ever sent before , and if it had n't been for the handwriting , it would have been hard to believe that Lucy had written it . That afternoon , he called Sam Patterson and asked himp161to come to dinner that night . The good thing about Sam was that there never was any problem about seeing him alone . All Sam ever did was tell his wife he was n't going to be home to dinner , and that was the end of it . Maybe Sam had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to ask about marriage . They had dinner at a hotel , with a bottle of wine , and Oliver found himself enjoying it and eating a great deal , after the ten days of cooking for himself . They talked lightly all through dinner , in the kind of conversational shorthand that develops between friends who have known each other many years , and it was only when the dishes had been cleared away and the coffee set down before them that Oliver said , " Sam , the reason I asked you to have dinner with me is that I need advice . I 'm in trouble and I have to make a decision and maybe you can help me . . . " Then , sipping his coffee , not looking at Patterson , Oliver told him the whole story , the call from Tony , the arrival at the lake , Tony 's outburst , Lucy 's denial and accusation of Tony , Bunner 's confession , everything . He spoke slowly and evenly , without emotion or shading , methodically presenting all the facts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an accident , like a doctor giving the symptoms of a puzzling case to a specialist who has been called in for consultation . Patterson listened silently , showing nothing on his face , thinking , I do n't know another man who would make such a dry , accurate , well-organized report out of his life 's convulsionlike this . He is making love , desire and betrayal sound like a paper to be read before an historical society on a minor treaty of the eighteenth century . At the same time , listening impassively , Patterson could not help feelingan unworthy twinge of jealousy . If she finally was going to choose somebody , he thought , why could n't she have chosen me ?  |p162And  mixed with all this was a helpless flavor of satisfaction . Oliver , who before this had never asked help or advice from anyone . Oliver , the most self-sufficient and reticent of men , was coming to him for aid in his moment of pain and doubt . It made Patterson feel more important in Oliver 's company than he had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open some new gate of affection and compassion for his friend . Finally , he thought , no friendship is completeuntil your friend turns to you in despair . Seated in the corner of the restaurant , their table removedfrom the other diners , Patterson listened carefully to the measured , fastidious voice of his friend . I must get all the facts straight , he thought , almost as if he were going into an operating room where the slightest haziness or misunderstandingmight mean the difference between life and death ; this is one time I must not say or do the wrong thing . . . It never occurred to me , " Oliver was saying , " that anything like this could ever happen to us . It 's just un-believable . " Patterson smiled inwardly to himself , although no sign of it showed on his face . Friend , he thought , out of his different experience , it is never unbelievable . " And the way it happened , " Oliver went on . " The damned commonplace way it happened . With the twentyyear-oldtutor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoker ! " I will warn Lucy , Patterson thought sardonically , to make it more original the next time . Pick a hunchback , or the governor of a Southern state , or a Negro drummer . Her husband has an aversion to the obvious . " When women are ready to pick someone , " Patterson said , " they choose from the available material . Literary precedents have very little to do with it . At a moment like that , nobody thinks of herself as a character in an offcolorjoke. "  | " What do you mean , ready to pick someone ? " Oliver said harshly . " Did you ever think that Lucy was ready to pick someone ? " " No , " Patterson said honestly . " Not until now . " " And now . . . " Patterson shrugged . " Now , after it 's happened , " he said , " it 's not altogether surprising . " " What do you mean by that ? " There was hostility in Oliver 's voice . " Adultery , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of self-expression . " For a moment , Oliver seemed angry . Then he laughed . " I see I came to the right man , " he said . " Okay , Philosopher . Continue . " " All right , " Patterson said . " Try to look at it from her point of view for a few minutes . What have you done with her since your wedding day . . . ? " " I 've done a hell of a lot , " Oliver broke in . " I 've taken care of her every minute for fifteen years . Maybe it might sound crass , and I do n't suppose I 'd ever say it to her , but she 's lived damned well and she 's never had to worry about anything and no matter how tough it was for me from time to time , I never said a word to her . Christ , she 's pretty nearly the only woman in the country who hardly even knew there was a Depression . To this day she ca n't keep a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . I 'll tell you what I did for her  --  I took full responsibility for her , " he said angrily , as though Pattersonwere Lucy 's representative and was arguing her case . " She 's thirty-five years old and she has n't the faintest notion of how tough it is to be alive in the twentieth century . For fifteen years she 's been living like a schoolgirl on a holiday . Do n't ask me what I 've done for her . What 're you nodding about like that . . . ? " " Exactly , " Patterson said . " Just what I said . "  | " What do you mean , just what you said ? " Oliver 's voice was beginning to rise . " Now do n't get angry with me , " Patterson said goodhumoredly . " I have n't slept with any college boys . " " That 's a damned poor joke , " said Oliver . " Look , " said Patterson , " you 've come to me for help , have n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , of course . " " Well , the only way I know how to help , " Patterson said , " is to try to figure out why she finally did something like this . " " I know why , " Oliver said angrily . " She 's a . . . " He stopped and shook his head . Then he sighed . " No , she 's not at all . Go on . I 'll keep quiet . " " You made all the decisions , " Patterson said . " You took her away from her work . . . " Her work . " Oliver made a contemptuous sound . " Messingaround in a smelly laboratory for an old idiot by the name of Stubbs . You ever hear of him ? " " No . " " Neither has anyone else . If she worked with him for twenty years , maybe they 'd have produced one paper , provingthat algae were green . " Patterson chuckled . " You laugh , " Oliver said . " But it 's true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Galileo away from his telescope . The human race was going to survive just the same , whether or not she went into that laboratory five mornings a week . She was n't so different from all the other girls . She fiddled around , pretending to have a career , waiting to get married . The cities 're full of them . " " That 's another thing , " Patterson said . " I talked to her . She hated leaving New York . " " If every woman who could n't live in New York felt she had to betray her husband in consequence . . . " Oliverp165began . He shook his head angrily and drained the last of the wine from his glass . " And what about me ? " he asked . " Do you think I wanted to come here to live ? " he asked . " Do you think I wanted to be saddled with the printing business ? That was the meanest day of my life , when I came up here after my father died and looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collapse if I did n't take hold . For ten years , " he said , " every time I 've gone through the gate of the plant , I 've felt myself growing rigid with boredom . But I have n't taken it out on my wife . . . " " The difference is , " Patterson said gently , " that you made the decision . And she had to follow . " " God , it was over ten years ago ! " " You can build up a good case of regret in ten years , " Patterson said . " You can get to feel real useless in ten years . " " Useless ! " Oliver was making little balls of bread crumbs and flicking them brusquely against the wine bottle . " She had the boy to take care of , the house . . . " Would you be satisfied just taking care of a little boy and a house all your life ? " Patterson asked . " I 'm not a woman . " Patterson grinned . " What is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Set up a Female WPA ? Interesting projects , " he said sardonically , " for women who have nothing to do between three and five in the afternoon . " He looked at Patterson suspiciously . " How do you know so much ? " he asked . " Has she been filling your ear ? " " No , " Patterson said . " She did n't have to . " " What about your own wife ? " Oliver said , attacking . " What about Catherine ? " Patterson hesitated . " Catherine is a lost , placid soul , " he said . " She gave up hope when she was nineteen . " He shrugged . " Or maybe she did n't . Maybe I do n't know herp166at all . Maybe she 's writing pornographic novels in the attic . Maybe she has a string of lovers from here to Long Island Sound . We do n't communicate enough for me to find out . It 's a different kind of marriage , " he explained regretfully , concealing his envy of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could possibly make either of us angry . " He smiled crookedly . " Or even mildly dis-turbed . " " Why 've you kept it up so long , then ? " Oliver demanded . " Why did n't you quit ? " Patterson shrugged again . " It hardly seemed worth the trouble , " he said , almost truthfully . " Good God , " Oliver said . " Marriage . " They sat in silence for a moment , gloomily , two men fixed in contemplation of complexity , waste , cross-purposes . Patterson allowed his mind to wander away from Oliver , and he remembered some of the other problems that he had been confronted with just that day , in the ordinary course of his work , in his own office . Mrs. Sayers , who was only thirty-three years old , but who had five children , and who was suffering stubbornly from anemia and who was tired all the time ; so tired , she said , that when she had to get up at six-thirty every morning , to prepare breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing up on the cross , she said , and she meant it . And nothing , as far as Patterson could see , to be done about it . And Mr. Lindsay , who was a machinist , and whose hands were so crippled with arthritis that he could barely hold his tools , and the effort of trying to hide it from the foreman so great that the sweat broke out on his face from the minute he entered the shop until long after he got home at night . And nothing to be done about it . And the woman who had come into his office three months ' pregnant , only her husband had been in Panama for six months . All the routine , randommisery and ailments that the human race casuallyp167pushed across a doctor 's desk every day of the week . And a step removed from that  --  the newspaper tragedies  --  the men who were going into battle in Spain , and who would be dead or broken by tomorrow evening , and the people being hunted down and destroyed all over Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver 's pain must be minute and inconsiderable . Only no man calculatedhis agony against an objective scale , and a thousand deaths on another continent finally were likely to weigh less in a man 's private balance than his own toothache . No , Patterson corrected himself , it 's not fair . There was also the question of tolerance of injury to be considered . The threshold of pain varied enormously  --  one man might suffer an amputation with nothing more than a stoical grunt , while another might go into shock with a crushed finger . Perhaps Oliver was a man with a low threshold of pain when the injury was infidelity . " Self-expression , " Oliver was saying thoughtfully , staring down at his hands spread out on the tablecloth . " What ? " Patterson asked , forgetting for a moment . " Your theory , " Oliver said . " Oh , yes , " Patterson said , smiling . " Of course , you must remember it 's just a theory and I have n't kept any scientific checks . . . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a man like you , " Patterson said , " who insistsupon making all the decisions at all times , for everybody . . . " " It 's not because I want to , " Oliver protested . " I 'd be delighted if other people would take the responsibility . But people just diddle around . . . " Patterson grinned . " Exactly . Well , after a few years like that , it seems to me that a woman 'd begin to feel that the thing she wanted most , the thing she just had to do  --  would be to make one big important decision by herself . Andp168you 'd closed all the other fields to her  --  you told her where she was to live and how she was to live and how she was to bring up her son  --  By God , I remember now , you even told her what the menus should be for dinner . " " I have special tastes in food , " Oliver said defensively . " I do n't see why I ca n't eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed , and a second later , Oliver laughed , too . " Hell , " he said , " I must have some reputation around this town . " " Well , it is true , you 're considered a man who knows his own mind , Oliver . " " If she had so many objections , " Oliver said , " why did n't she speak up ? Nobody 's under a vow of silence in our house . " " Maybe she was afraid to . Or maybe she did n't know she had the objections until this summer . " " Until a twenty-year-old boy came along , " Oliver said sullenly , " who does n't have to shave more than twice a week and who has n't got anything better to do than lounge around a lake all summer , playing with married women . " " Maybe , " Patterson said astringently . " At least , " Oliver said , " if it was a grand passion  --  if she was in love with him , if she was ready to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she laughed at him when he asked her to marry him ! It 's so damn frivolous ! " " I ca n't help you there , " Patterson said . " And I think , in the long run , you 're going to be glad it was frivolous . " Oliver tapped the table impatiently . " And then , to top it all , " he said , " she had to be so inept . Letting the boy see her . " " Oh , " Patterson said , " children see worse things than that . They see their parents being cowardly , or cruel , or crooked . . .  | " It 's easy for you to talk , " Oliver said . " You do n't have a son . " " Send him away to school for a couple of years , " Pattersonsaid , ignoring what Oliver had just said , " and he 'll forget it . Children forget everything . " " You think so ? " " Sure , " said Patterson , being glib . " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oliver sighed . " Grownups forget everything , too , " Patterson said . " You know you 're a liar , " said Oliver . Patterson smiled . " Yes . " " Then what 're you talking like that for ? " " Because I 'm your friend , " Patterson said soberly , " ancl I know you want to take her back , and I want to give you all the reasons why you should , even if they 're lousy rea-sons . " " Some day , " Oliver said sarcastically , " when you 're in trouble , make sure to come to me for advice . " " I 'll do that , " Patterson said . " So  --  what do you think I ought to do ? " Oliver asked . " Practically ? " " Go up there tomorrow and be noble , " Patterson said promptly . " Forgive her . Take her to your bosom . Tell her you know she 'll be a paragon amongst wives from now on . Tell her you 'll let her arrange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jokes , " Oliver said . " Do n't send her off in the summer by herself any more . " " She did n't want to stay up there , " Oliver remembered . " She begged me to take her back with me . If I let her , she 'd hang around my neck twenty-four hours a day . " " There you are , " Patterson said . " It 's so damned complicated . And what can I tell Tony ? " " Tell him it was an accident , " said Patterson . " A grown/up accident , that he 's too young at the moment to understand . Tell him you 'll explain everything when he 's twenty-one years old . Tell him to be a good boy at school and stop looking through windows . " " He 's going to hate us , " Oliver said , peering down into his cup . " He 's going to wind up hating both of us . " There was nothing to be said to this and Patterson did n't try . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the check . " This is on me , " he said , when Patterson tried to take it . " Payment for professional services . " On the way out of the hotel , Oliver sent a telegram to Lucy , telling her to pack and be ready , he was coming up to get her the next afternoon.  | " Arriving around three o'clock , tomorrow , " the telegram had read . " Please have everything packed and be ready to leave immediately . Wish to make as much of the trip in daylight as possible . Oliver . " Lucy had re-read the telegram a half dozen times . She had been tempted to telephone Oliver , but had decided against it . Let him come , she had thought . Let it be settled , once and for all . After the night of Oliver 's visit , Lucy had stayed in the cottage , numbly forcing herself to go through the routine of holiday with Tony , waiting , in the beginning , for something to happen , some message , some event which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a climax , disastrous , or violent if need be , but punctuating her life , finishing one section , marking the beginning of another . But nothing had happened . Oliver had not called or written ; Jeff had disappeared ; the days wore on , sunny ,  |p172long  , ordinary . She went in to meals with Tony , she worked with him on his eye exercises , she went swimming with him , read to him , feeling that everything she did was unreal , that what she was doing she was not doing because it was useful , but because it was habit , like a ruined man going daily to his office to work over accounts that had long been closed merely because he had grown accustomed to it through the years and there was nothing else he could think of to do with his time . She watched Tony greedily , but every day , under the cloak of custom and familiarity , she had the feeling that he was becoming more and more unknown to her . If , suddenly , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she had awakened and found him standing over her bed with a knife in his hand , if he had disappeared forever into the forest , she would have had to say to herself , " Of course , I expected something like that . " He was polite , obedient , ungiving , and with the passage of each day she felt the strain becoming greater . It was as though , each night , when she put the light out in his room , and said , " Good night , Tony , " somebody , somewhere , was turning a ratchet to which her life was attached and pulling her one notch tighter . Ten days passed ; the guests departed from the hotel , the nights turned chilly , the members of the band packed their instruments and returned to the city . Tony seemed neither happy nor unhappy . He held the door open for her politely when they went in to dinner , he came immediately out of the water when she called to him , " You 're getting cold , you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , volunteerednothing . When she caught him watching her , his eyes seemed to her the eyes of a grown man , stubborn , unrelenting , accusing . By the end of the ten days she found that it was only by a painful act of memory that she could rememberp173what he had seemed like earlier in the summer . And it was almost impossible to believe that so short a time ago she had considered him a little boy , loving , childish and easy to handle . Now , when they sat together on the lawn , in a stiff , artificial representation of a mother with her son on holiday , she felt herself rattled and clumsy , resenting him more and more each day , like two strangers , shipwrecked , floating across the ocean on a raft , begrudging each other the daily swallow of water from the canteen , suspicious of each movement . Soon his remoteness seemed to her to be open malevolence , his cold politeness an unhealthy and precocious vengeance on her . Finally , she thought , What right has he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him not as a child , but as a mature and implacableopponent , she thought , In the long run , what have I done to him ? And mixed with it all , there was a growing resentment of Oliver , too , for leaving her there alone with Tony for ten days , each of them using the other , she felt , to punish her . At last , Lucy wrote Oliver and told him that she was going to leave him . She wrote it without heat , without excuses , without disclosing her plans for the future . Actually , she had no plans for the future . It seemed to take all her energy , all her powers , merely to wake up each morning and know that for another fourteen hours she would have to support the scrutiny of her son . In the act of writing the letter to Oliver , she had forced herself to make certain decisions about herself . But even as she made them , she had the feeling that they were provisional , that a smile from Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I must leave you , " she had written . " It 's impossible for me and Tony to live in the same house , " and she had meant it , but as time wore on she had almost lost her belief in the validity of what she hadp174written , as a condemned man , after months of waiting in his cell , comes to believe more in the permanence of his bars , the faces of his guards , the regularity and monotony of his diet and his hours of exercise than in the words of the sentence , which , at some distant and by now unimaginablehour , will abruptly kill him . Then the telegram had come and broken the painful but familiar routine , the drift , the sense of being suspended in time , the feeling of being able to postpone , indefinitely , the decisions that would change her life . She had told Tony to get ready and had helped him pack and now his bags were all neatly arranged on the porch  --  the telescope , the baseball bat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and summer , leaning against an angle of the wall . She had packed nothing of her own . Tony had noticed it , she knew , but silent as ever , had said nothing about it . It was nearly three o'clock now and Lucy sat quietly on the porch , waiting , her eyes going again and again to the small pile of her son 's belongings . It was a clear brilliant day , with a touch of autumn in the air , and the lake had taken on a colder blue , preparing for winter . Tony came out , dressed in the suit in which he had made the trip up to the lake and which now , after only two months , seemed too small for him . He was carrying a small valise which he put down next to the others . " Is that the last one ? " Lucy asked . " Yes , " said Tony . " Did you look around ? Is everything cleared out of your room ? " " Yes , " Tony said . " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's nothing left , " Tony said . Lucy watched him for a moment and stared out at the quiet lake and the distant , hazy mountains . " You can almostsee the autumn approaching , " she said . She shiveredp175a little . " It 's a season I never liked . It 's funny , " she said , trying to make a connection , even in this fragile way , with her son , " it 's funny not to hear the bugle any more , is n't it ? " Tony did n't answer . He looked at his watch . " What time is Daddy coming ? " he asked . " He 'll be here any minute , " said Lucy , once more defeated . " He said he 'd be here about three o'clock . " " I think I 'll go wait for him down at the gate . " Tony started off . " Tony , " said Lucy . He stopped . " What ? " he asked flatly . " Come over here , " Lucy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back and stood in front of her . " What do you want ? " he asked . " I want to look at you , in your city clothes , " Lucy said . " You look so grown-up . Those sleeves are too short for you . " She touched his shoulder . " And it 's awfully tight across here , is n't it ? You must have grown inches this summer . You 'll have to get a new wardrobe for school as soon as you get home . " " I 'm going down to the gate , " Tony said . Lucy made a last effort . " Tony , " she said , smiling tremulously , feeling that this was the last possible moment , alone here with everyone else departed , the hills and the lake silently plunging into autumn , " Tony , will you give me a kiss ? " He stood there impassively but not unkindly , studying his mother 's face . Then he turned , without emotion or resentment , and started away . Lucy flushed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once more and looked at her patiently . " What do you want ? " he asked . Lucy hesitated . " Nothing , " she said . There were footsteps from around the corner of thep176house and Jeff came into view . He , too , was wearing city clothes , a brown tweed suit , and a carefully knotted tie . He was carrying the phonograph under his arm . That boy , Lucy thought , with an hysterical desire to laugh , makes all his entrances and exits lugging a phonograph . Jeff came up to the porch tentatively . He looked much paler than he had two weeks before , as though he had been indoors all the intervening time . He stopped without coming onto the porch . " Hello , Tony , " he said . " Lucy . " Tony said nothing . Lucy was taken aback . By an act of will , she had dismissed Jeff from her calculations long ago . Now , looking at him , she had a double sensation , a memory of past pleasure in him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ casual . " Hello , Jeff , " she said lightly . " I did n't know you were still around . " " I came up again , " Jeff said uncomfortably , " to help my sister pack . I heard you were still here and I thought . . . " He looked at the bags in a row on the porch . " Are you leaving today ? " " What do you want ? " Tony asked , ignoring the question . " I just came to say good-bye , " Jeff said . The neat city clothes and his obvious lack of ease made him seem smaller to Lucy , seemed to push him back into awkwardness and adolescence . If he had been wearing those clothes all summer , she thought , remembering the white T shirts , the bare feet , I would never have touched him . He put the phonograph down on the edge of the porch . He smiled experimentally at Tony . " I thought you might like to have this , Tony . As a kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you like to listen to music and I thought . . . " He stopped , floundering under Tony 's unblinkingstare . Lucy broke in , moved by Jeff 's embarrassment . " That 's awfully kind of you , " she said in an artificial , hostess-like voice , " but really , it 's too much . What will you do thosep177cold winter nights up in New Hampshire when the wind howls and you 're snowed in ? " She looked with purposely exaggerated admiration at the phonograph . " It is a beautifullittle machine , is n't it , Tony ? " Tony did n't move . He stood with his legs apart , dominatingthem both . " Are you giving it to me ? " he asked Jeff . " Yes , " said Jeff . " Why ? " " Why ? " Jeff asked , unhappy at the question . " Oh , I do n't know . Because we had some good times together this summer . Because I 'd like you to remember me . " " Are you going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's all mine ? " Tony said , ignoring her , speaking directly to Jeff . " I can do whatever I want with it ? " " Sure , " said Jeff . " You can take it with you to school and put it in your room . When you start to have parties you can dance to it and . . . " Jeff stopped and watched tensely as Tony approached the machine , looking at it , touching it impersonally . Then Tony went over to where the baseballbat was leaning against the porch wall . He came back to the phonograph , holding the bat in one hand . With his free hand he brushed the machine off the porch , onto the lawn . Then , with great deliberation , he began to swing the bat at the phonograph . " Tony ! " Lucy called . She moved over to stop him but Jeff caught her arm . " Leave him alone , " Jeff said harshly . They watched silently while Tony coldly and methodically destroyed the phonograph . After a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and faced his mother and Jeff with a look of hard , mature triumph on his face . Deliberately he dropped the bat . " There , " he said . " That was a brutal , wasteful thing to do , " Lucy said . " I 'm ashamed of you . " She turned to Jeff . " I apologize for him . "  | " Do n't you apologize for me , " Tony said . " Never . Not for anything . " " It 's okay  --  Tony , " Jeff said gently . " If it made you feel better , it 's okay with me . " Tony looked from the broken machine , first to his mother and then to Jeff . " No , " he said , " it did n't make me feel better . I guess you want to talk to each other before my father comes . I told Bert I 'd say good-bye to him before I left . I 'll be back in five minutes , " he said threateninglyand strode away toward the dock . Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then Jeff went over and touched the wreckage of the phonographruefully with his toe . " I bet my aunt would be surprised if she ever found out what happened to her present , " he said . He stepped onto the porch and came across to Lucy . " These last weeks , " he said , " have been gruesome , have n't they ? " Gruesome , Lucy noted . Is that a word in vogue this year in the Eastern colleges ? She hesitated . I 'm not going to get involved , she thought . I 'm going to finish him . " Have they ? " she said lightly . She chuckled . " What are you laughing at ? " Jeff asked suspiciously . " I keep remembering what I was thinking as Tony waswhacking away at the poor little phonograph , " said Lucy . " What 's that ? " " I kept remembering how carefully you worked with him , " Lucy said , " teaching him how to swing a bat . Step in , Tony . Keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't put your foot in the bucket . ' He certainly learned , did n't he ? " " It 's not so funny , " Jeff said . " Oh , it 's not so serious , " Lucy said airily . " Tell your aunt it was stolen and she 'll give you another one for Christ-mas . " " It 's not that , " Jeff said . " He hates me. "  |p179Lucy  shrugged . " A lot of people will hate you before you 're through . What of it ? " " What about you ? " Jeff said . " Hate you ? " She managed to chuckle again . " Of course not . " " Am I going to see you again ? " Jeff asked . " Of course not , " Lucy said . " I 'm sorry , " said Jeff . He plunged his hands in his pockets . He seemed smaller than ever . " I guess I should have stayed away . " " No , " Lucy said . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was even a little brave . " Her tone was motherly , bantering . " Do n't pull such a long face . This was a nice , educational experience for you . The summer course for third-year students  --  a short term , compulsory for a bachelor 's degree  --  choice of instructors . " " How can you take it so lightly ? " Jeff 's face looked stricken . " Instructors . . . " Lucy sounded puzzled . " What 's the feminine of instructor ? Instructress ? It sounds wrong somehow , does n't it ? " " I made a lot of trouble , did n't I ? " Lucy made a little grimace , indicating that she thought Jeff was overestimating his importance . " People have to expect to pay a little for their fun , " she said . " Fun ? " Jeff said , shocked . " Do n't look so scandalized , " she said . " It was fun , was n't it ? I 'd feel awful if I thought you had n't enjoyed it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of duty . " " It was glorious , " Jeff said solemnly . " It was heartbreaking . . . it was like an earthquake . " " Oh , my , " Lucy waved her hands in a fluttery , girlish gesture , " it 's too late to be getting solemn all over again . " The pain was clearly evident on Jeff 's face . " You 're so different today , " he said . " Why ? "  | " It 's later in the season . " Lucy went over to the row of bags and stood there , frowning down at them , pretending to check them against some list in her mind . " You 're going back ? " Jeff asked . " Back to him ? " Lucy pretended to be puzzled . " Back to whom ? " " Your husband , " said Jeff . " I imagine so , " Lucy said matter-of-factly , turning toward him . There was no sense in telling him about the letter she had written Oliver . " Do n't people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main reasons a girl gets married  --  to have someone to go back to . " " Lucy , " he appealed to her , " what 's happened to you ? " Lucy walked toward the edge of the porch and stared out across the lake . " I guess I 've finally become a big , grown-np lady , " she said . " You 're making fun of me , " Jeff said bitterly . " I do n't blame you . I behaved like such a hick . Blurting out everythingthe minute he asked me . Going off with that damn phonograph under my arm like a kid who 's just been kicked out of school because he 's been caught smoking in the locker room . " " I would n't worry about little things like that if I were you , " Lucy said . " Actually I 'm glad he found out . " " Glad ? " Jeff asked incredulously . " Yes , " she said . " I 'm such a bad liar . It 's too much of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone changed suddenly , becoming serious , almost threatening . " I found out it 's not for me . Never again . " " Lucy , " Jeff said , trying to salvage something from the summer , " if we ever meet again , what 're you going to think of me ? " Lucy turned and regarded him thoughtfully . But when she spoke her tone was more playful than ever . " I 'll think , " she said , " What a touching young man ! Is n't it strange thatp181I once thought , for a little while , that I was rather in love with him ? " They were facing each other  --  Lucy obdurate , implacablyfrivolous , Jeff forlorn and boyish , when Oliver , whom they had not heard , came around the corner of the porch . He was dressed for traveling and the long trip had left him wrinkled and weary-looking and he moved slowly , as though his energy were low . He stopped when he saw Lucy and Jeff . " Hello , " he said and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lucy said , without warmth . " I did n't hear the car . " " I just came to say good-bye , " Jeff said uncomfortably . Oliver waited . " Yes ? " " I want to say I 'm sorry , " Jeff said . Oliver nodded . " Ummn . . . " he said vaguely . " Are you ? " He moved across the porch , looking down at the ruins of the phonograph . " What happened here ? " " Tony . . . " Jeff began . " It met with an accident , " Lucy broke in . Oliver was not interested . " An accident ? " he said incuriously . " Are you finished here , Jeff ? " " Yes , all finished , " said Lucy . " He was just leaving . " She put out her hand to Jeff . " Good-bye , " she said , forcing him to shake her hand . " Walk away with a nice springy step now . Make sure you study hard and get beautiful high marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but could n't . He tore his hand away from her and wheeled and plunged out of sight around the corner of the cottage . Watching him , Lucy felt like weeping . Not because he was going and she would never see him again , or because for a little while he had been dear to her and it was all spoiled now . She felt like weeping because he was so clumsy and she knew how it was hurting him and it was her fault.  |p182When  Jeff was gone , Oliver turned to Lucy . " Where 's Tony ? " he asked . " He 'll be back in a minute , " said Lucy . " Oh . " Oliver looked at the row of bags on the porch . " Where are your things ? " he asked . " Inside ? " " They 're not packed , " Lucy said . " I told you in the telegram , " Oliver said , a little of the old domestic irritation at her inefficiency creeping into his voice , " to be ready at three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in the dark . " " I ca n't go home , " Lucy said . " Did n't you get my letter ? " " I got it , " said Oliver impatiently . " You said there were a lot of things to be cleared up between us . Well , we can clear them up just as well in our own house as here . I do n't want to stay here any longer than necessary . Go in and pack your things , Lucy . " " It 's not as easy as that , " Lucy said.  |p183Oliver  sighed . " Lucy , " he said , " I 've thought it all over . And I 've decided to forget what happened this summer . " " Oh , you have , " said Lucy , her voice curiously hard . " I 'll accept your promise that it 'll never happen again , " Oliver said . " Oh , you will , " said Lucy , the hardness now becoming metallic and toneless . " You 'll believe me if I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago you would n't believe a word I said . " " Because you were lying , " said Oliver . " How do you know that I wo n't lie again ? " Lucy asked . Oliver sat down , the lines of fatigue bitten into his face , his head nodding over his chest . " Do n't torture me , Lucy , " he said . " Answer me , " she said harshly . " How do you know I wo n't lie to you again ? " " Because I have to believe you , " Oliver said , his voice almost inaudible . " I sat in the house , thinking of what it would be like to try to live the rest of my life without you . . . and I could n't stand it , " he said simply . " I could n't do it . " " Even though I 'm a liar and you hate liars , " Lucy said , standing over him . " Even though I disgust you ? " " I 'm trying to forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't forget it , " Lucy said . " You were right . It was disgusting . I disgusted myself . " Oliver raised his head and looked at her . " But you 'll change now ? " " Change ? " said Lucy . " Yes , I will . But perhaps not in the way you think . " " Lucy , " Oliver asked , and that was the first time he 'd ever asked the question , " do n't you love me ? " Lucy stared at him thoughtfully . " Yes , " she said slowly , " yes , I do . I 've been thinking myself these last ten days ,  |p184about  you . About how much I owe you . How much I need you . How much you 've done for me . How solid you 've been . How secure . " " Lucy , " Oliver said , " it 's so good to hear that . " " Wait , " said Lucy . " Not so fast . You 've done something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've converted me . " " Converted you ? " Oliver asked , puzzled . " What do you mean ? " " You always talked so much about your principles , " said Lucy . " About the truth . About seeing things clearly , about not fooling yourself . You even wrote a long letter to Tony about it this summer , when you were worried about his eyes . " " Yes , I did , " said Oliver . " What about it ? " " I am now your disciple , " said Lucy . " And I 'm the worst kind of disciple . Because the first person I 've used my faith on is you . " " What are you talking about ? " Oliver asked . " Lies G end you , do n't they , Oliver ? " Lucy was speaking calmly , reasonably , as though she were explaining a mathematicalequation . " Yes , they do , " said Oliver , but he sounded wary and defensive . " Deception of any kind , by anyone , " Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sickening to you , is n't it ? " " Yes , it is , " said Oliver . " You believe that , do n't you ? " Lucy asked . " Yes . " " And you 're lying , " said Lucy . Oliver 's head jerked back angrily . " Do n't say that . " " You 're lying to me , " said Lucy . " But most of all to yourself . " " I do n't lie , " Oliver said tightly . " Should I prove it to you ? " Lucy said , still friendly andp185impersonal . " Should I prove to you that a good part of your life is based on lies ? " " You ca n't , " said Oliver . " Because it is n't true . " " No ? Let 's forget us for the moment , " said Lucy . " Who 's your best friend ? " " What are you driving at ? " Oliver asked . " Sam , " Lucy said . " The good Dr. Patterson . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife are in and out of our house every week . You play golf with him . You 've lent him money . You confide in him . I would n't be surprised if you 've even told him about this . . . this trouble between you and me . " " It happens that I did , " Oliver said . " I had to talk to someone . He 's not only my friend . He 's yours , too . He advisedme to come back to you . " Lucy nodded . " My friend , " she said . " And your friend . And what do you know about our friend , Dr. Patterson ? " " He 's intelligent and loyal , " said Oliver . " He 's a damn good doctor , too . He pulled Tony through . " Lucy nodded again . " All true . But you krkw several other things about him too , do n't you ? About him and other women , for example ? " " Well , " said Oliver , " it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're lying again , Oliver , " Lucy said gently . " You see what I mean ? You know about him and Mrs. Wales . You know about him and Evelyn Mueller . You know about him and Charlotte Stevens , because it started in our house two years ago and people have been talking about it right at our own dinner table ever since . " " All right . " Oliver was cornered . " So I know . " " And now I 'm going to tell you something else , " L .. ucy said mildly . " He 's tried with me , too . Because that 's the kind of man he is . Because he ca n't see a woman more than twice without making the effort . You must have known that , too . "  | " I refuse to believe it , " Oliver said . " Of course you do . And you went to his house a hundred times and invited him to ours . And all the others . The wives and husbands . The attached , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose . . . you knew about them all . And you were polite to them and friendly to them and laughed , the way all our friends do , when the talk turned that way , or when there was a scandal in the newspaper . But when it struck home you did n't laugh . All that tolerance , all that civilization , all that humor , it turned out , was not for use at home . " " Stop it , " Oliver said . But Lucy went on , inexorably . " I 've been thinking about all this , Oliver , for the last ten days , and I 've decided you were right . At least what you said was right , even if you did n't live up to it . " " We 'll live any way you want , " said Oliver . " We 'll stop seeing anyone you say . We 'll start with a whole new group of friends . " " I did n't say that , " Lucy said . " I like our friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been happy for so long has been because of them . I 'd hate not to see them any more . " Oliver stood up , his face flushed . " What in the name of God do you want , then ? " he shouted . " I want to live , " Lucy said quietly , " so that no one will ever be able to say liar again to me . So that I 'll never be able to say liar to myself . " " Good , " Oliver said hoarsely . " If you mean that , I 'm glad all this happened . " " Not so fast , " Lucy said . " As usual , you 're in a hurry to settle for half the truth . The pretty half . The half that you can believe in publicly . The attractive half . The half that makes you feel noble and self-satisfied . But the private half  --  the secret , unpleasant , harmful half  --  that exists , too ,  |p187Oliver  . From now on you 're going to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to confess about anyone else , " Oliver said , " about any other college boys , or doctors , or dinner guests , or people on a train  --  spare me . I 'm not interested in your past . I do n't want to hear about it . " " I do n't want to confess the past , Oliver , " said Lucy softly , " because there 's nothing there . " " Then what ? " Oliver asked . " I want to confess the future , " said Lucy . Oliver stared at her , baffled , angry . " Are you threateningme ? " he asked . " No , " said Lucy . " I just want to make sure that if ever I go into our house again I come in clean . If I finally come home , we start a new marriage and I want that under-stood . " " Nobody starts a new marriage after fifteen years , " said Oliver . " No . " Lucy nodded agreeably . " Perhaps not . Well then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as though I 've been the same girl you met so many years ago . As though I 'm still twenty , to be cuddled , protected , patronized . Finally , in any important matter , disregarded . And until now I 've always accepted it because . . . " She shrugged . " Who knows why I 've accepted it ? Because I was lazy . Because it was easier . Because I was afraid to anger you . But now . . . now you 've been so angry that there 's nothing more to fear . The marriage has been broken . Maybe it will be put together again and maybe it wo n't . Whatever happens I see that I 'll survive it . So  --  now  --  I no longer accept you . " " What does that mean ? " Oliver asked . " When I agree with you , good , " said Lucy . " I accept you . When I do n't  --  I go my own way . "  | " This is the damnedest thing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Lucy raised her hand warningly . " You must n't use words like that , Oliver . " " Whatever you call it . You commit the crime , the transgression . . . God , what 's the polite word for it ? And somehowyou 're the one who 's laying down the terms . " " Yes , Oliver , " said Lucy . " Because your terms do n't work any more . I 've been trying to figure out these last ten days why I did what I did , after so long . . . " Why ? " Oliver demanded . " You 're not going to like this , Oliver , " Lucy said warningly . " Get it over with , " Oliver said bitterly . " Get all the poison out this afternoon and we can start forgetting it on the trip home . " " We ca n't forget it , " said Lucy . " Not you and not me . In many ways you were a good husband . You were generousto me . I was warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you gave me a handsome son whom I used to love a great deal . . . " " What now ? " asked Oliver sharply . " What are you going to tell me now ? " " You treated me as a child so long , " said Lucy slowly , " that the times when you suddenly had to treat me as a woman , when you made love to me , I had a child 's reaction . Bored , embarrassed , incomplete , disgusted . " " You 're lying , " Oliver said . " I told you I was never going to let anybody say that to me again , " said Lucy . " But you always seemed . . . " " Most of the time it was a performance , Oliver , " saidLucy gently . " Not always  --  but most of the time . " " For so many years ? " Oliver asked dully , disbelievingly . " Yes . "  | " Why ? Why did you do it ? " Oliver asked . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't think you could bear it , " said Lucy , " if I did . " " And now ? " " And now , " said Lucy , " I 'm more interested in myself than in you , I guess . That 's what you did to me that eveningten days ago , Oliver . " " I 'm not going to listen to you ! " Oliver was raging now . " For five thousand years women have been excusing whatevercheap excursions they 've made by wailing that their husbands were too old or too preoccupied or too inadequate to satisfy them . Do me the honor of thinking of something original . " " Do n't think , " said Lucy , " that I 'm trying to throw all the blame on you . Maybe if you 'd been different , if we 'd been different together , it would n't have happened . Nothingwould have happened . But , " she explained honestly , " it was n't only that . I wanted him . For a long time I would n't even admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sorry I 'd been so foolish and waited so long . " " What are you trying to tell me ? " Oliver asked . " Are you going to see him again ? " " Oh , no , " said Lucy lightly . " He has his own . . . inadequacies . He 's too young . He 'll be inconsequential for another ten years . He served a useful purpose but it 's back to school for the children now . " " A useful purpose , " Oliver said sardonically . " Yes , " said Lucy . " He made me feel what a delightful thing it was to be a woman again . He was nothing but at the age of thirty-five he made me see what pleasure was to be found in men . " " That 's a whore 's philosophy , " Oliver said . " Is it ? " Lucy shrugged . " I do n't think so and I don'tp190believe you think so . Whatever it is , that 's the way I feel and you might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me ? " Oliver asked . " I 'm trying to tell you that it 's probably going to happen again . " " You do n't mean it . You 're just saying it . You 're revengingyourself on me . " " I mean it , " Lucy said . " We 'll see , " Oliver said desperately . " We 'll see . " " We wo n't see , " said Lucy . " Why are you so shocked ? You 've been in locker rooms , bars , smoking rooms . Is n't that what all the conversation amounts to ? And if you could listen in on ladies ' luncheons and teas . . . The only difference is that after fifteen years my husband has made me tell the truth about myself and to myself . " " No marriage can last like that , Lucy , " said Oliver . " Maybe not , " Lucy said . " That would be too bad . " " You 'll wind up as a lonely , forgotten old woman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment I think it will be worth it . " " I ca n't believe it , " said Oliver . " You 're so changed . You 're not the same person you were even two weeks ago . " " You 're right . I am changed , " said Lucy . " Not for the better . Honestly , I believe that . Much for the worse . But it 's me now . It 's not a reflection of you . It 's not one unimportant , timid , pale , predictable fifth of your life . It 's me , uncovered . My own owner . My own self . " " All right , " Oliver said sharply . " Go in and pack and let 's go home . I 'll get hold of Tony and tell him to get ready . " Lucy sighed . Then , surprisingly , she laughed . " Oliver , darling , " she said , " you 're so in the habit of not listening to anything I say that I could tell you your clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd burned right off . . . "  | " Now , what do you mean by that ? " Lucy spoke very seriously . " I wrote you I was n't going home with Tony . Did n't you read my letter ? " Oliver made an impatient gesture . " I read it . I read it , " he said . " It 's absurd . You obviously were in a state of nerves when you wrote it and . . . " " Oliver , " Lucy said warningly . " Anyway , " Oliver said , " it 's only for a few days . He 'll be going to school by the end of the month and then you 'll get a chance to calm down . You wo n't see him again until Thanksgiving and . . . " " I 'm not going to see him for a few days , " Lucy said . " And I 'm not going to see him at Thanksgiving . And I 'm not going to see him at Christmas . And I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Oliver said harshly . " And do n't be a fool . . . Lucy closed her eyes wearily and waved her hand gently , dismissingly . " Why do n't you go home , the both of you , " she said , " and leave me alone ? " " I thought we settled that , " Oliver said . " We have n't settled anything . You said you wanted me back , and I said I wanted to come back . On certain conditions . One of the conditions is that I do n't have anything more to do with Tony . " " For how long ? " Oliver asked hoarsely . " Forever . " " That 's melodrama , " Oliver said . " It does n't make any sense at all . " " Now listen carefully , " Lucy said , standing directly in front of Oliver , controlling her voice with effort . " I mean every word I 've said and every word I 'm going to say . He hates me . He 's my enemy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's the witness against me , " Lucy said , " and he 'll never forget it , and neither will I. Every time he looks atp192me , he 's looking through that window that rainy afternoon . He looks at me and he 's judging me , prosecuting me , condemningme . . . ' " Do n't be hysterical , Lucy . " Oliver caught her hands , soothingly . " He 'll forget . " " He wo n't forget . Ask him . Ask him yourself . I ca n't live in the same house with my judge like that ! I ca n't be made to feel guilty twenty times a day ! " Her voice was shaken now and she was close to sobbing . " You must try , " Oliver said . " I have tried , " Lucy whispered . " I did everything I could to heal us . Even when I wrote you that I could n't come back with him , I still hoped . . . I did n't really believe it , even while I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did this . . . " She pulled her hands away and pointed to the broken phonograph . " With a baseball bat . But it was n't a machine he was destroying . It was me . He was murdering me ! " She was shouting crazily now . " Mur-der ! " Oliver seized her and shook her , sharply . " Stop that ! Control yourself ! " Sobbing , not trying to free herself , she said , " He 'll poisoneverything . What 'll we turn out to be after five years like that ? What sort of man will he be at the end of it ? " ' Oliver dropped his hands . They stood next to each other for a moment , without moving . Then Oliver shook his head . " I ca n't do it , " he said . Lucy took in her breath in a long sigh . She bent her head and absently put her hands across her breast to her shoulders , stroking the spots where Oliver 's hand had gripped her . When she spoke her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take him away with you and leave me alone . For good . " " I ca n't do that , either , " Oliver said . In the same flat and toneless voice , still touching herp193shoulders gently , Lucy said , " You 'll have to do one or the other , Oliver . " Oliver turned and went over to the edge of the porch , his back to Lucy . He leaned against a pillar , staring out across the quiet lake . And I was sure I had it all figured out , he thought . He felt defeated and incapable of further plans or decisions . What I should have done , he thought , with bitter hindsight , was pack everybody up the night I was here and get us all home together . Now , everybody 's had time to dig in . He heard a movement behind him and he turned quickly . Lucy was opening the door of the cottage , on her way in . " Where 're you going ? " he asked suspiciously . " Tony 's coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Tony walking swiftly toward the cottage . " I think it 'd be a good idea if you talked to him . " She went inside , the screen door tapping lightly behind her . Oliver watched her shadowy figure disappear through the rusted mesh . He shook his head and made himself smile before he turned to face Tony . He walked out onto the lawn a little way to greet him . Tony approached warily , his face grave and watchful , and stopped before he reached his father . " Hello , Daddy , " he said , waiting . Oliver went over to him and put his hand around Tony 's shoulders and kissed his cheek . " Hello , Tony , " he said . Still with his arm across the boy 's shoulders , Oliver walked back to the porch . " I 'm all ready to go , " Tony said , pointing to the bags on the porch . " Should I start carrying things to the car ? " Oliver did n't answer . He dropped his arm from Tony 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sat down heavily , like an old man , staring at his son.  | " I thought we were supposed to get out of here by three o'clock , " Tony said . " Come over here , Tony . " Doubtfully , as though fearing punishment , Tony walked across the porch and stopped in front of the chair . " Are you sore at me , Daddy ? " he asked in a low voitc . " No . Of course not . Why should I be ? " " For calling you that night , " Tony said , looking at the floor . " For telling you what . . . what I saw . . . " Oliver sighed . " No , " he said . " It was n't your fault . " " I had to tell you , did n't I ? " Tony was pleading now . " Yes , " Oliver said , after a pause . He stared at his son , wondering how much of this day the boy was going to remember . Children forget everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grownups forget everything . But none of it was true . Tony was going to remember clearly , accurately , painfully , and his life was going to be built on the memory . It would be simpler and less painful to slide past this moment , to make an excuse for taking the boy home alone , for packing him off to school alone . It would be easier to put him off temporarily if he asked about Lucy , to be vague and tricky when he wrote from school about coming home for the holidays , to let him discover slowly , by himself , over a period of time , that he had been put outside the boundaries of the family . It would be simpler , less painful , and finally , and with justice , as a grown man , Tony would despise him for it . Oliver reached out and drew the boy to him , putting him on his lap , holding his head against his shoulder , as he had done long ago , when Tony had been small . " Tony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way , with the boy 's weight against him , and the bony feel of his legs , and his head averted , " listen carefully . I wish this had n't happened . I wish , if it had happened , you neverp195knew about it . But it happened . You found out about it . And you had to tell me . " Tony said nothing . He sat tensely , imprisoned in his father 's arms . " Tony , " Oliver said , " I 'd like to ask you a question . Do you hate your mother ? " Oliver felt the boy stiffen in his arms . " Why ? " Tony asked . " What did she say ? " " Answer the question , Tony . " With a sudden movement , Tony wriggled out of his father 's arms , and stood in front of him , his hands clenchingand unclenching . " Yes , " he said savagely . " I hate her . " " Tony . . . " Oliver started painfully . " I 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly , his voice high and sharp and childish . " She can say anything she wants . Maybe I 'll say yes or no once in a while , when I have to , but I 'm not going to talk to her . " " How would you feel if you never saw her again ? " Oliversaid . " Good ! " He stood there , shoulders hunched , chin out fiercely , like a boy challenging another boy to cross a line drawn in the dust before him . " She does n't hate you , " Oliver said gently . " She loves you very much . " " I do n't care what she says . " " But she 's afraid of you . . . " " Do n't believe her . Do n't believe anything she says . " Now he did n't sound like a little boy at all . " And because she 's afraid of you , " Oliver went on , conscientiously , but without hope , going to the end of every argument , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She does n't want to live in the same place with you , she says . " For a moment , Oliver thought that Tony was going top196cry . He ducked his head and he rubbed his hands jerkily against his thighs . But then he raised his head and looked squarely at Oliver . " That 's okay with me , " he said . " I 'm going to school anyway . " " Not only school , " Oliver said , persisting . " She never wants to see you , she says . She does n't even want to let you come into the house . Not on Christmas . Not on holidays . Never . " " Oh . " Tony 's voice was so soft that Oliver was n't sure he had said anything . " What if you said , It 's my house , I 'll take in anybody I want . ' " " Then she 'll leave me , " said Oliver flatly . " This after-noon . " " Oh . " Tony glanced , measuringly , at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm afraid not . " " Why not ? " Oliver sighed and when he spoke , he did n't look at Tony , but above his head , at the blue sky , cold with its premonition of autumn . " It 's hard to explain to a thirteenyear-oldboy what a . . . a marriage is like , Tony . How a man and a woman become  --  locked  --  with each other . I miscalculatedon myself . Do you know what that means ? " Tony thought for a moment . Then he nodded . " Yes . You thought you were a certain way and you turned out to be another way . " " A certain way . " Oliver nodded . " It turns out that I was wrong . " " All right , " Tony said harshly . " What do you want me to do ? " " I 'm going to leave it up to you , Tony . If you say the word , I 'll call your mother out here and tell her you 're staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 'll be the end of it . " Tony 's mouth quivered . " And how 'll you feel then ? "  | " I . . . I 'll feel like dying , Tony , " Oliver said . " And if I say I 'll go away ? " " I 'll take you home and start you in school and I 'll come back for your mother , " Oliver said , still looking over Tony 's head at the cold sky . " I 'll visit you on holidays and maybe in the summertime we could go on trips together . To the Rockies , to Canada , maybe even to Eu-rope . " " But I never could come home ? " Tony asked , like a man at a ticket window in a railroad station asking all possible questions , to make sure there would be no mistakeabout the train he was to take . " No , " Oliver whispered . " Not for a long time . " " Never ? " Tony asked harshly . " Well , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Right now your mother 's rather hysterical , but in time , I 'm sure . . . " " Okay ! " Tony turned away , presenting his back to Oliver . " What do I care ? " " What do you mean , Tony ? " Oliver stood up andwalked over behind Tony , but did n't touch him . " Call her out here . Tell her you 'll come back for her . " " Are you sure ? " Tony wheeled around and stared bitterly at his father . " Is n't that what you want ? " " It 's up to you , Tony . " Tony shouted now , out of control . " Is n't that what you want ? " " Yes , Tony , " Oliver whispered . " That 's what I want . " " Okay , " Tony said recklessly . " What 're we waiting for ? " He ran over to the door and threw it open and shouted in . " Mummy ! Mummy ! " Then he turned back to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very quickly , his hands fumbling , he started to pick up his valises . " I want to put these old things in the car ! " " Wait . " Oliver put out his hand to restrain him . " You'vep198got to say good-bye . You ca n't just go off . Maybe , at the last minute , she 'll change her mind . . . " " I do n't want anyone to change their mind , " Tony shouted . " Where 's my telescope ? " The door opened and Lucy came out . She looked pale , but composed , her eyes going from Oliver to Tony and back again . " Oliver . . . " she said . " I 'm taking Tony with me now . " He tried to sound routine and matter-of-fact . " I 'll call you . I 'll be back for you some time next week . " Lucy nodded , her eyes on Tony . " We might as well get started now , " Oliver said , with shaky briskness . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all your things ? " He pointed at the two valises . " Yes , " Tony said . He avoided looking at his mother , and gathered up the bat , the telescope , the fishing rod . " I 'll carry these . " Oliver picked up the two valises . " I 'll wait for you in the car . " His voice was choked and muffled . He tried to say something to Lucy , but nothing seemed to come out . He walked off hurriedly , carrying the bags . Tony stared after him for a moment , then , still avoiding looking at his mother , peered around him , as though makingsure he was n't leaving anything behind him . " Well , " he said , " I guess I got everything . " Lucy went over to him . There were tears in her eyes , but she was n't crying . " Are n't you going to say good-bye ? " she asked softly . Tony fought with the movements of his mouth . " Sure , " he said gruffly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , standing close to him , but not touchinghim , " I want you to grow up into a wonderful man . " With a childish cry of anguish , Tony dropped the thingshe was carrying and threw himself into Lucy 's arms . Theyp199held each other tight for a long time , but they both knew they were only saying good-bye and that it was n't going to do any good . Finally , Lucy stepped back , resolutely . " I think it 's time to go , " she said . Tony 's face stiffened . " Yes , " he said . He bent and picked up the bat and the telescope and the fishing rod and started after Oliver . He stopped at the corner of the porch , and Lucy felt that for the rest of her life that was the way she was going to remember him , in the suit that had grown too small for him during the summer , stifffaced , holding the implements of childhood , outlined against the ruffled blue lake . " If we happen to just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , just by accident , like peopledo , on a train or in the street , I mean  --  what do we say to each other ? " Lucy smiled shakily at him . " I . . . I guess we say hello , " she said . Tony nodded . " Hello , " he said thoughtfully . He nodded again , as though satisfied , and disappeared around the corner of the porch , following his father . Lucy stood still . After a while she heard the car start and drive off . She did n't move . She just stood there , looking out at the lake , with the wreckage of the phonograph at her feet . And that was the summer .   " Well , Mr. Crown , " the headmaster was saying , " as in most cases of boys his age , there 's a little of everything to report . " The headmaster raised the bottle of sherry inquiringly , but Oliver shook his head . When Oliver had been in school he was sure that his headmaster had not offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver realized that this was a sign that education had become more relaxed since he was a boy , but he also realized that if he accepted a second glass , a minute demerit would be entered , at the back of the headmaster 's mind , against the Crown family . The headmaster put the bottle down ceremonially . His name was Hollis , he was surprisingly young , and he moved delicately in the cheerful library-like room which served as his office , as though to reassure the parents of the boys entrusted to his care that the developing souls would not be harmed by any sudden or uncalculated movement on his part.  | " What I mean , " Hollis went on , smiling boyishly , expertlytaking the sting out of judgment , " is that he has his problems , even as you and I did at his age , I 'm sure . " " When I was his age , " Oliver said , purposely frivolous , to keep from being lectured , " my one problem was that I could only chin forty-three times . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birthday . " Hollis smiled dutifully , accustomed to many generationsof fathers . " Of course , " he said , " the physical thing can not be altogether discounted . Because he ca n't join in all the games with the other boys , the team games  --  although I do hear he plays rather good tennis  --  it 's possible that his  --  uh  --  leaning toward solitude , toward going-italone , has been somewhat accentuated . Although the school doctor is quite satisfied with his physical condition  --  we give him very careful over-all examinations once a month , you know . In fact , the doctor has privately expressed the opinion to me that Tony , if he wished , could indulge in a great deal more group activity than he actually does . " " Maybe he just does n't like the group , " Oliver said . " Maybe if the group was different , he 'd plunge in up to his neck . " " Perhaps , " Hollis said . The tone was mollifying and polite , but there was a chilly blink of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Although we do have a fine group of boys here , if I say so myself . Most representa-tive . " " I 'm sorry , " Oliver said , knowing that he had been too brusque to this harmless , conscientious man only because it was impossible to explain anything to him . " I 'm sure it 's Tony 's fault . " " Well "  --  Hollis spread his hands forgivingly  --  " fault is a harsh word . Taste , perhaps . No doubt he 'll change as he gets older . Though , as the twig is bent . . . " He shrugged and smiled at the same time , administering ap202warning and a caress at the same moment . " He does particularlywell at one thing , " Hollis went on , happy to be able to uncover treasure . " He does the cleverest cartoons for the school paper . We have n't had a boy as gifted as that in many years . They 're surprisingly mature . Rather acid , I must say . . . " Again the soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary and rather unpleasanttruth . " I , myself , have heard some grumblings in certain quarters about the sharpness of some of his caricatures . But , of course , he must have sent them to you , you 've seen them yourself . . . " " No , " Oliver said . " I have n't seen them . I did n't know he did them . " " Ah . " Hollis regarded Oliver curiously . " Really ? " He bent his head and shuffled through some papers on his desk , then spoke more quickly , tactfully getting away from the subject . " He does fairly well in biology and chemistry . Which is all to the good , of course , since he means to take a pre-medical course . He 's  --  uh  --  negligent , I 'm afraid , in most of the other subjects , although I 'm told he does a great deal of reading on his own . Unfortunately , " again the understanding , practiced , headmaster 's grimace , " almost none of the reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if he wants to get into a good college in two more years . . . " Hollis left the sentence hanging , mildly and ominously threatening , like the first delicate puff of wind on a still , dark day . " I 'll talk to him , " Oliver said . He stood up . " Thank you very much . " Hollis stood up , too , framed against the window , behind which , in the distance , the gray Gothic buildings of the campus glittered dully in the autumn sun . He held out his hand , a spry , intelligent young man in a soft blue shirt , knowingly representing solid , gray-stone tradition , discreetly tempered by progress . The two men shookp203hands and Hollis said , " I suppose you 've come up to take Tony back to Hartford with you for the holiday ? " " We do n't live in Hartford , " Oliver said . " Ah ? " Hollis said . " I thought I remembered . . . " " We moved almost a year ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jersey now . In Orange . I had a chance to sell my plant in Hartford and buy a larger and more up-todateone in New Jersey , " he explained , giving all the false reasons . " Do you like New Jersey better ? " Hollis inquired politely . " Much , " Oliver said . He did not explain that he would have liked any place in the world better than Hartford , any place to which he and Lucy came as strangers , any place in which they had no friends to ask curious questionsabout Tony and to fall into strained silence wheneverthe subject of children came up in conversation . He did not explain , either , that for the last six months of their stay in Hartford , Lucy had refused to see any of their old friends , with the exception of Sam Patterson . Sam Pattersonknew most of what there was to be known , and there was no need to lie to him . With all the others , the weight of speculation had finally been too much to bear . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After an evening with them , I feel as though I 've been with a group of cryptographerswho 've been working with all their might to crack a code . And the code is me . I 've had enough of it . If you want to see them , you go yourself . I 'm through . " " Well , " Hollis was saying , " Orange is n't so far . Are you driving Tony home today ? " " No , " Oliver said . " This Thanksgiving my wife and I 're going down to South Carolina . It 's my one chance to play some golf before the winter sets in . I just came up to have lunch with Tony . " " Oh . " A noncommittal blink of academic eyes . " I 'll ar/range to have Tony in to our house for Thanksgiving dinner . I 'll tell Mrs. Hollis . " " Thanks , " Oliver said . " Will there be many boys here ? " " A few , " Hollis said . " We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are always one or two from  --  uhbrokenfamilies . . . " He ducked his head deprecatingly , smiling , deploring and forgiving the ways of the modern world . " Though most of the boys who live too far away , or who do n't go home for one reason or another , usually are invited by friends . " He paused , dutifully , permitting a parent to understand that his son was not the sort of boy who was invited by friends . " Do n't worry , " he said heartily . " Tony will be well fed . " He escorted Oliver to the outside door , and stood there , in the cold autumn wind , his bright necktie blowing , watching Oliver get into his car and start off toward the hotel where he was to meet Tony . Oliver went to the bar of the hotel to wait for Tony . He ordered a whisky to take the taste of the academic sherry out of his mouth , and thought over what the headmasterhad said , the gentle warnings , the unfavorable judgments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony 's mother , in all the two years that the boy had been at the school , had never put in an appearance . Well , that was one of the things a teacher was for  --  to show you your son in the light that others saw him , to prepare you for what he was probably going to be like as a man . Staring somberly into his whisky glass , Oliver realized that , as kindly as possible , the headmaster had been trying to tell him that he foresaw Tony as a lonely and unpopularman , with no great taste or aptitude for work , and an unpleasantly sharp and mocking attitude toward the peoplearound him . Oliver sipped his whisky , resenting the headmaster and his confidence in his own judgment andp205his sense of prophecy . All these people , Oliver thought defensively , are wrong most of the time . That 's why they became teachers in the first place . When he had been Tony 's age , his own teachers , he knew , had predicted vague but glittering glories for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy who hardly had to study at all to get the highest marks in his class , who had been a leader in all games , a captain of teams , a president of clubs and classes , a precocious and graceful squire of young ladies . Well , Oliver thought grimly , hunched over his glass , they ought to come and take a look at me now . Thinking again of Hollis , he wondered what made him so confident of himself . Having a small , definite , achievableaim , and achieving it early ? Being surrounded by the gray , unchallenging , semi-failures who made up the facultiesof small , country schools ? Dictating , with affable severity , to hundreds of boys who passed out of his life before they became old enough seriously to oppose him , and whose later estimates of him would never come back to him ? Living always by a comfortable curriculum that hardly changed from one year to the next  --  so many hours for Latin , so many for sport , so many for the neat , adolescentadoration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Thou shalt honor thy mother and thy father , thou shalt learn to recognize the ablative absolute , thou shalt not cheat on examinations , thou shalt prepare thyselffor Harvard . And , along with all these solid foundations and secure passageways , having a pretty , buxom young wife who had come to him with a little money of her own , and who saw him always in a position of command , and who , because of his job , worked with him daily , almost hourly , so that each year their interdependencebecame cozier and more useful and intimate . Maybe the next time Oliver went into that cheerful office andp206shook that hearty hand , he would murmur , delphically , " Remember Leontes . . . " All goes well , Teacher ? Oliver thought , grinning at his own vulgarity . Try sending your wife to the mountains for a summer . He was about to order another whisky when through the open doorway of the bar , he saw Tony coming into the lobby of the hotel . Tony had n't seen his father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peered , a little near-sightedly , through his glasses , around the hotel lobby . He was n't wearing an overcoat and his tweed jacket was too short in the sleeves for him and he was carrying , rather clumsily , a large square of drawing board under one arm . He was taller than Oliver remembered , although he had seen him only six weeks before , and he looked thin and undernourishedand cold from the sharp November wind . His hair was long and fine , in contrast to all the other closecroppedstudents whom Oliver had passed on the campus , and he seemed to hold himself nervously and challengingly . He had a big head , too large for his thin shoulders , and his features had fined down and his nose seemed too long for the rest of his face and to Oliver he seemed to have the air of some queer , half-timid , half-dangerous bird , solitary , ruffled , uncertain whether to fly or attack . Looking at his son , Oliver had a strange double image . In the long nose and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glasses , he could see Lucy 's inheritance , and the broad , slightly domed forehead and the big , firm mouth made him remember , confusedly , photographs of himself when he was in school . But none of it seemed to hang together . The air of challenge , the feeling of suspicion , almost , that Tony brought with him , seemed to keep the elements of his face and body from fusing.  |p207Then  Tony saw him , and waved , and came into the bar , and when he was up close and shaking Oliver 's hand , familiaritywiped out the fragmentary impressions , and it was just Tony , grave , polite , well known . They went into lunch and after the first ten minutes in which they discussed what they wanted to have and Oliverasked the usual questions about how Tony felt and how things were going in class and if he needed anything , and Tony gave the usual answers , the periods of silence grew , as usual , longer and longer and harder for each of them to bear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony , both he and Tony would be happier for it . But that was out of the question , although it would be hard to say why . Observing Tony across the table , Oliver noted that the boy ate politely , spilled nothing , moved his hands deftly and with precision . He kept his eyes down , and only once or twice during the meal , when Oliver for the moment had looked away and then suddenly turned back , did he catch Tony watching him , thoughtfully , without malice or love . When Tony caught Oliver 's glance , he lowered his eyes , without haste , and continued eating , calmly and silently . It was only when they were eating dessert that Oliversuddenly realized that there had been something about the boy 's appearance that had been bothering him ever since they had shaken hands . A heavy , long , blond fuzz had come out on Tony 's upper lip and chin and there were isolated tufts of fine , curly hair along his jaws . It gave him a shaggy and unkempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puddle . Oliver did n't say anything about it for a while , but he kept staring at the uneven , fine beard on his son 's face . Of course , he thought . He 's almost sixteen . " Mr. Hollis , " Oliver said , " told me that he was going top208invite you to Thanksgiving dinner at his house tomorrow . " Tony nodded , without pleasure . " If I have time , " he said , " I 'll go . " " He 's a pretty good fellow , Mr. Hollis , " Oliver said heartily , glad of a subject for conversation , avoiding , with a twinge of guilt , asking what other plans Tony might have for the holiday . " He 's been watching you pretty closely . He says you have a lot of talent . The cartoons , I mean , for the paper . . . " I draw most of them in his class , " Tony said , neatly spooning up his chocolate ice cream . " It keeps me from falling asleep . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoiding a more searching question about Tony 's estimate of Mr. Hollis . " European history . He 's crazy about Napoleon . He 's only five feet four inches tall , so he 's crazy about Napo-leon . " Was I that mean , Oliver thought , was I that observant , when I was fifteen years old ? " I 'd like to see some of the drawings , " he said . " If you happen to have any around . " " They 're nothing . " Tony spooned away at his ice cream . " If anybody with any real talent came into this school , they 'd never even look at mine . " One thing this boy really can do , Oliver thought ruefully , is choke off conversation . He glanced around the room , to avoid looking at his son 's burgeoning beard , which , unaccountably , was beginning to get on his nerves . There were several boys eating with their parents at other tables , and directly across from the table at which Oliver and Tony were sitting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than thirty-five , and who had gold bracelets on both sleeves that sounded all over the room when she moved her hands . She was sitting acrossp209from a tall , heavy-boned boy , who was obviously her son , with the same straight nose , the same direct , happy look of carefully tended health . The son had bright blond hair , cut very close , and his well-shaped head rose on a powerful , thick neck from a fullback 's broad shoulders . Olivernoticed that he was very polite with his mother , smiling often and listening eagerly , quick at passing the butter and pouring water , holding her hand unselfconsciously on top of the tablecloth as their voices mingled in quiet , friendly murmurs . American youth , Oliver thought , advertisement . He became acutely conscious of the impression that he and Tony must give in contrast . Tony , with his long , unfashionablehair , his thin shoulders , his glasses , his fragile neck , and the puppy hair on his chin and jaws . And he himself stiff and obviously ill-at-ease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to strike up a conversation with his taciturn and unfriendly son . As he stared across at the mother and son at the other side of the room , the woman saw him , and smiled warmly , in parental convention , at him . She had shining , even white teeth , and when she smiled she looked much less than thirty-five . Oliver smiled back and nodded . He nodded again when the boy , followinghis mother 's silent greeting , saw Oliver , and gravely stood up and made a little , reserved , respectful bow . " Who 's that ? " Oliver asked curiously . Tony glanced at the other table . " Saunders , " he said , " and his mother . He 's captain of the ice-hockey team , but he 's yellow . " " Why do you say that ? " Oliver felt that he had to protest , although he was n't quite sure whether he was protestingon the part of the boy or on the part of the mother . " I 've seen him , " Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's the richest boy in school , though . "  | " Oh , is he ? " Oliver glanced once more at the couple at the table , noticing more carefully the golden arms . " What does his father do ? " " Chases chorus girls , " Tony said . " Tony ! " " Everybody knows it . " Tony methodically cleaned off the plate of ice cream . " His father is n't so rich . It is n't that . Saunders makes the money himself . " " Oh , does he ? " Oliver regarded the large handsome boy with new respect . " How ? " " He lends money at interest , " Tony said . " And he has a copy of the last chapter of Ulysses and he rents it out for a dollar a night . He 's the president of the sixth form . " Oliver was silent for a moment . Confusedly , he remembered reading Alice in Wonderland and Just So Stories to Tony when he was six years old . A chapter a night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in his slippers and bathrobe , ready for bed , smelling of soap , sitting on the edge of the armchair , his feet on Oliver 's knees , so that he could see the illustrations in the lamplight . " What do you mean , the last chapter ? " Oliver asked , certain that there was some childish misunderstanding or desire to shock here . " You know , " Tony said patiently , " Mrs. Bloom in bed , and the tenor and the soldier in Gibraltar . Yes , yes , yes . All that stuff . " " Have you read it ? " " Of course , " Tony said . " It 's worth a buck . " " This is a hell of a school , " Oliver said , forgetting , for the first time during the meal , the constraint that had made conversation so difficult for him . " I think maybe I 'd better let Mr. Hollis know about this . " " What 's the difference ? " Tony shrugged . " Everybody in the whole school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baffled , at his son , sitting two feet awayp211from him , shaggy , with the pimples and fuzz of puberty on his face , and a cold , unafraid , measuring light in his eye , removed , mysterious , unpunishable . " Well , " Oliver said , more loudly than was necessary , " one thing we 're going to do before we leave here is shave that damned beard off your face . " When they left the dining room , Mrs. Saunders smiled again , radiantly , shaking her golden bracelets . Saunders , immense , smooth-cheeked , bull-necked , smiling with the gravity of a young senator , stood up and made his mannerly , serious bow . They walked to a drugstore and Oliver bought a heavy gold-plated safety razor , the most expensive one in the shop , and some shaving soap . Tony watched him impassively , asking no questions , standing there with the clumsy piece of drawing board under his arm , glancing from time to time at the covers of the magazines that were displayed near the soda fountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side by side , as other fathers and sons were doing , across the dying grass of the campus , cold and wet through the thin soles of Oliver 's city shoes . Some of the fathers lifted their hats in salute and Oliver did the same , but he noticed that the greetings between Tony and the other boys , with or without their parents , were always curt and unenthusiastic . Oh , God , Oliver thought , as he followed Tony 's narrow back up the stairs of his house , what have I got here ? Tony had a room of his own , a somber cubicle with greenish walls , one window , a narrow bed , a small desk , and a battered wooden cupboard . It was severely neat . There was an open wooden box on the desk , with a stack of papers , evenly clipped together , in it , and the books on the desk were lined up in an orderly row by two granite bookends . The bed did n't have a wrinkle on it and no clothing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , I ought to send Lucy here to take lessons in housekeeping . On the wall above the bed was a large map of the world , with little colored pins stuck into it , here and there . And hanging from a string from the ceiling , in front of the cupboard , was a yellowed human skeleton , wired together , with several important bones missing . On the desk was Tony 's telescope . This was the first time that Oliver had been in Tony 's room , and he blinked , taken aback , at the skeleton . But he did n't speak about it for the moment , telling himself , with nervous reassurance , that it probably showed commendablezeal in a boy who was preparing for the study of medicine . " I thought everybody here shared a room with another boy , " he said , unwrapping the razor and slipping in a blade . " That 's the idea . " Tony was standing in the middle of the room , staring reflectively at the map on the wall . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Your cough ? " Oliver asked , puzzled . " I did n't know you had a cough . " " I do n't . " Tony grinned . " But he was a nuisance and I wanted to be alone . So I used to wake up every night at two o'clock and cough for an hour . He lasted just over a month . " Oh , Lord , Oliver thought despairingly , Hollis is earninghis money keeping him in school . " Take off your shirt , so you wo n't get wet , " he said , opening the tube of shaving cream . Without taking his eyes from the map , Tony began slowly to unbutton his shirt . Oliver looked more closely at the map . There was a pin stuck in the city of Paris , and a pin stuck in Singapore and pins in Jerusalem , Assisi , Constantinople , Calcutta , Avignon , Beirut.  | " What 're those pins for ? " he asked curiously . " I 'm going to live in each of those places three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get out of medical school . I 'm going to be a ship 's doctor for ten years . " He took off his shirt and went over to the cupboard and opened the door , making the skeleton swing out into the room , with a dry , unpleasant clatter of loose bones . Tony hung his shirt neatly on a hook and closed the cupboard door . Ship 's doctor , Oliver thought . What an ambition ! He kept his eyes off Tony and stared at the map . Paris , Calcutta , Beirut . Distance , he thought . " And where 'd you get the skeleton ? " Oliver asked . " In a pawnshop on Eighth Avenue , " Tony said . " In New York . " " Do they let you go to New York by yourself ? " Oliver asked , beginning to feel that it was hopeless to try to keep up with the plans and movements of his son . " No , " Tony said , thoughtfully touching the skeleton . " I tell them I 'm going home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said lamely . " I see . " For a moment , he had a vision of his wife and his son , unknown to him , unknown to each other , standing on opposite corners of the same avenue , waiting for the lights to change , crossing , in the crowds , close enough to touch , never touching . With a sense of revulsion , he watched Tony , naked from the waist up , thoughtfully fingering the skeleton . " How much did that cost ? " he asked . " Eighty bucks . " " What ? " Oliver could n't stifle the tone of surprise . " Where 'd you get that much money ? " " I won it at bridge , " Tony said calmly . " We have a regulargame . I win three out of four times . " " Does Mr. Hollis know about this ? " Tony laughed coldly . " He does n't know about any/thing . " He raised his arm and touched the base of the skeleton 's skull . " The occipital bone , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bones . " A more normal father , Oliver thought , with a more normal son , would praise him for such proof of industry . But the sight of the bare , smooth adolescent torso , vulnerable , slender , balanced and neatly shaped , next to the yellowedsticks of the pawnshop skeleton was suddenly unbearableto Oliver . " Come over here , " he said brusquely , going to the basin in the corner of the room , " and let 's get this over with . I have to be in New York by six o'clock . " Tony gave the skeleton one last , affectionate pat , which started once more the dicelike clacking of the bones . Then , obediently , he walked toward the basin and stood in front of Oliver . " First , wash your face , " Oliver said . Tony took off his glasses and turned the water on and washed his face . He did it thoroughly , meticulously . Then he dried his hands and turned toward Oliver , the fuzz on his cheeks darkened and flattened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony 's face , feeling the sharpness and delicacy of the cheekbones under his fingertips . Tony stood patiently , unblinking , without moving . Like an old blase horse being shod , Oliverthought . Oliver used the razor a little uncertainly , in small , tentativestrokes . He had never shaved anyone else before and it was different from shaving yourself . As he worked , he remembered , sharply , the day that his own father had shaved him for the first time . It had been the summer when he was fourteen , in the big house at Watch Hill , facing the ocean , and his father had come up for the week-end and had squinted at him , puzzledly , for several hours , much as he himself had squinted at Tony during lunch . Only , atp215the end of it , his father had burst into laughter and had roughly mussed Oliver 's hair and had marched him up to the old , dark mahogany bathroom , shouting through the halls for the entire family to come and watch . Oliver 's older brother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sisters , aged twelve and ten , a little disturbed by the unaccustomed boisterousness of their father , had appeared at the doorway of the bathroom , where Oliver was standing , grinning uneasily and stripped to the waist , while Oliver 's father methodically stropped his ivory-handled , straight-edge razor . As Oliver cautiously made narrow swathes in the shavingcream on Tony 's cheek , he remembered , with total clarity , the exact , flat , pleasing , rhythmic noise that the razor in his father 's hand had made against the leather strap that hung next to the marble basin in the bathroom on the seashore in 1912 . He remembered , too , the dry smell of the shaving soap , the feel of the badger-hair brush , the mixed smell of his father 's bay rum and his mother 's lavender that always hung in a thin , mysterious perfume in the bathroom . He remembered the feel of the ocean salt on his bare shoulders from the morning swim , and his mother in a blue organdy dress and his sisters , bareleggedand grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , come in , " his father had said . " Watch the initiation of a man , ladies . " His mother and sisters had stood there in the doorway , while his father had worked up the lather on his face , but when his father had taken the razor and had flipped it three or four times on the palm of his hand , his mother had tapped the shoulders of her daughters and had said , " This is no place for us , girls . This is for the males of the tribe . " She had been smiling , but the smile had been a funny one , one that Oliver had never seen on his mother 's face before , and she had firmly led the girls out and closedp216the bathroom door before Oliver 's father had made the first stroke with the razor . Oliver 's father had watched silently , gravely , for several long moments after the door had closed . Then he had chuckled , and holding Oliver 's chin with one hand , he had shaved him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feel of his father 's fingers on his jaw , firm , strong , gentle  --  and , he realized much later , after his father was dead , full of love and regret . With his own hand on his son 's chin , conscious that his movements lacked the assurance of his father 's at that distant , similar ceremony , Oliver was obscurely oppressed by the recurrence of rites , with their different weight of love and gayety . Remembering , for the first time in many years , vanished summers , almost-forgotten children , unvisitedrooms , his robust and sure-fingered dead father , Oliver had the feeling that when Tony , in his turn , looked back from the vantage point of maturity on this half-comic , half-solemn moment , in the bare , neat dormitoryroom , with its flaking skeleton and its map marked with the colored pins of escape , he would have reason to complain of his father . None of this showed on his face , Oliver was sure , as he matter-of-factly scraped the thick white cream from Tony 's jaws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fuzz off the boy 's upper lip , and stepped back . " There we are , " he said . " Now wash your face . " Tony bent over the basin , cupping water in his hands and splashing himself vigorously . Oliver looked at the bent , naked back , thin , but with a wiry shape of muscle that the ill-fitting jacket had belied . The skin , Oliver noted suddenly , was exactly the same color and texture as Lucy 's , soft , very smooth , very white , with a healthy . glowingflush of blood near the surface.  |p217When  Tony straightened up and dried his face , he looked , for the first time , into the mirror above the washbasin . Staring at himself , he touched , with one hand , the new smoothness of his cheeks . Oliver , standing behind him , met Tony 's eyes in the mirror . With the glasses off , they were exactly Lucy 's eyes , large , deep gray , shadowy , intelligent . Suddenly , examining his son 's scrubbed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tony was going to be a spectacularly handsome man . Almost as if he had divined what was going on in his father'smind , Tony grinned at Oliver in the mirror . " Boy , " he said , embarrassed and pleased with himself , " we 're goingto kill them . " Then they both chuckled . And then Oliver knew that it was going to be impossible to leave Tony to the Thanksgivingdinner of the Hollises , to the headmaster 's hearty , paid-up hospitality , and his regretful misgivings , to the mournful prophecies he would make to his buxom wife about the future he foresaw for young Crown , to the companyof the deserted boys whose parents were in India or who came from broken homes and had failed to get invitedfor the holidays to homes that were not yet broken . " Pack your bag , Tony , " Oliver said crisply . " I 'm taking you home for the week-end . " Tony remained motionless for a second , searching his father 's face in the mirror . Then , without smiling , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and efficientlypacked his bag . On the drive toward New York , just as they neared the city limits , Tony asked , " How is Mother ? " " Fine , " Oliver said . It was the first time they had mentioned Lucy between them in two years.  |p218Lucy  came to the Pennsylvania Hotel bar five minutes before six . Keeping an obscure and unvoiced bargain with herself , she was always on time now and never kept Oliver waiting when they went out together or had an appointment to meet each other . The bar was full of commuters catching a last drink or two before getting their trains to New Jersey or Long Island , and there was a sign that announced that unescorted ladies would not be served at the bar . She found a table in a corner and ordered a whisky . She sat modestly in her corner , waiting for her husband , looking from time to time without shyness at the men who crowded around the bar , not lowering her eyes when they glanced at her . They looked gray and worn by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though they needed the liquor to face the trip home and the evening ahead of them . Freshly bathed and dressed herself , prepared for holiday , she felt a touch of pity and contempt , observingthem in their drab , office-staled clothes . She was looking forward to the dinner with Oliver in an Italian restaurantnearby that they both liked . And after that , the night on the train together . She had a childish love of trains and felt cosy and important sleeping in a compartment , listening to the sound of the wheels . And Oliver was a good traveler , attentive and much more talkative and light-hearted when he was away from home . Then she saw Oliver coming toward her , moving among the crowded tables . She smiled and waved at him . He did n't smile back . Instead , he halted for a moment , to allowsomeone who was walking behind him to come abreast of him . The two figures stood there , some thirty feet away , in the narrow aisle between the tables , cigarette smoke drifting lightly around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Impossible , she thought . Then the two figures advanced toward her and , withoutp219realizing what she was doing , she stood up . What a place to see him , she thought . In a bar like this . Oliver and Tony stopped across the table from her . They stood that way , confronting each other silently . " Hello , Mother , " Tony said , and she heard that his voice had changed . " Hello , Tony , " she said . She looked from one face to the other . Tony seemed wary , but not uneasy or embarrassed . Oliver was regardingher closely , his expression somber , watchful , vaguely threatening . Lucy sighed , gently . Then she moved out from behind the table and put her arms around Tony and kissed his cheek . He stood there , his hands at his sides , permitting himself to be kissed . He looks awfully tall and old to be my son , Lucy thought , conscious of the commuters watching the family scene . " We 're not going South , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the week-end . " It was more than a statement , and she knew it . It was a demand , a question , an assertion of change , a warning . Lucy hesitated only a moment . " Of course , " she said . " You two stay here , " Oliver said . " I 'll go across the street and turn in the tickets . I 'll be right back . " " No , " Lucy said , panicky at the idea of being left alone , so abruptly , with Tony . " It 's terribly noisy and smoky here . We 'll all go together . " Oliver nodded . " Whatever you say . " In the station she stood close to Oliver at the ticket windowwhile he wrangled with the man behind the wicket . She kept talking , in a voice which sounded , even to her , high and unnatural and artificially animated . " Well , this changes everything , does n't it ? We have a huge amount of planning to do . The first thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Thanksgiving dinner tomorrow . You know what we 'll do . . . we 'll go down to those wonderful Italian shops on Eighth Avenue , because all the stores 'll be closed tomorrow at home , and we 'll buy a turkey and sweet potatoes and cranberry sauce and chestnutsfor the dressing . . . " " By God , " Oliver said to the man behind the window , " I 'm giving you four hours ' notice . That 's enough for any railroad . When you buy a ticket you do n't make a contract for life , do you ? " The man grumbled and said he had to talk to the night manager and he left and could be seen talking , bent over , to a gray-haired man behind a desk , who occasionally glanced up bleakly at the window at which Oliver was standing . Tony stood silently , listening to his mother , scanning the crowds moving through the station . " And we 'll go into Schrafft 's , " Lucy went on , still in the high , nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mince pie , and we 'll buy some bread for cold turkey sandwiches for tomorrow night . And do you know what I think we ought to do tonight , Oliver . . . " She paused , waiting for him to answer , but he was glowering at the clerk and the manager and he did n't reply . " Tonight , let 's eat in Luigi 's , with Tony . Do you like Italian food , Tony ? " Tony turned slowly and looked at her , across the gap ofthe two years , across the gap in which knowledge of eachother 's tastes and manners and idiosyncrasies had disappeared . " I like it all right , " he said , speaking a little moreslowly than usual , as if he understood that his mother was going on at a rate and a pitch that was not normal for herand as if , by his own sobriety , he hoped to tone her down . " Good ! " Lucy said , with too much enthusiasm . " It'syour father 's and my favorite restaurant , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same sentence , a picturep221of shared tastes , marital harmony , friendship . " And then , after that , Oliver , do you know what I think we ought to do with Tony ? " " It 's about time , " Oliver said to the clerk , who had just come back to his station and was unpleasantly counting out the money for the exchanged tickets . " We ought to go see a show together , " Lucy said . " Do you like the theatre , Tony ? " " Yes , " Tony said . " Do you go often ? " " Once in a while . " " Maybe we can get into a musical comedy , " Lucy said . " What do you think , Oliver ? " Oliver turned away from the ticket window , after a disapprovinggrunt of farewell for the clerk . " What 's that ? " he asked . " I was saying , " Lucy said , talking swiftly , as though by the continual froth of her conversation she could keep any of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that maybe we could take Tony to a musical comedy . Since it 's a holiday evening and we 're all here in town togetherand . . . " What about it , Tony ? " Oliver asked . " You want to go to the theatre ? " " Yes , thank you , " said Tony . " But if it 's all the same to you , not to a musical comedy . There 's a play I heard about . . . Thunder Rock . I 'd like to see that , if we can get tickets . " " Thunder Rock , " Lucy said , making a little grimace . " I heard it 's terribly morbid . " " There 's no sense in wasting time on a musical comedy , " Tony said firmly . " It 'd be different if I lived in New York and got to the theatre all the time . " " Oliver . . . " Lucy said doubtfully . She was afraid of the effect on them of a grim play , afraid of the momentp222when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each other , and disturbed by two hours of dark emotion . A musical comedy , inconsequential and pretty , would make things easier . " It 's Tony 's party , " Oliver said , as they walked toward the steps leading out of the station . " The first thing we 'll do is go into the hotel and see if they can get us the tickets . " Lucy fell silent , walking between her husband and her son . He 's beginning to make everybody 's decisions again , she thought resentfully . She conducted the shopping tour through the crowded , holiday-eve markets with an extravagant and almost **25;9542;TOOLONG , piling her purchases indiscriminatelyinto Oliver 's or Tony 's arms , talking steadily , addingto the morrow 's menu , her eyes roving across the hanging rows of turkeys , the piled pyramids of oranges , apples , tangerines , grapefruit , the displays of South Americanmelons and pineapples , the bins of potatoes and chestnuts . Then they were late and they dumped their purchasesinto the trunk of the car and hurried to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she was doing , and where they had to cut the meal short to get to the theatre on time . As she shopped , and rattled on , and nervously ate and drank , Lucy was conscious only of a need for postponement . Dazed by the sudden appearance of Tony , uncertain whether it was an ambush or a reinforcement to her happiness , too unstrung to be able to see what signals either Oliver or Tony were putting up , she fought confusedly to keep from making any decisions herself in those first hours or permitting the others to make any decisions on their own part . In the theatre , she was drowsy and only listened inter/mittently to what the actors were saying on the stage . Betweenthe acts she said she was too tired to go out , and sat numbly by herself when Oliver took Tony across the street for a Coca-Cola . And on the long trip home , she sat in the back of the car , not quite awake , not trying to hear what Tony and Oliver were saying to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they got home , she nearly stumbled going up the front steps and said , quite truthfully , that she could n't keep her eyes open another minute . She kissed Tony good night , briskly and without emotion , as though the two years had not intervened , and left Oliver with the job of settling the boy down in the guest room . It was a retreat and she knew it and she was sure that Oliver , at least , and probably Tony , too , understood it , but she was too tired to care . When she got into bed and turned out the light , she had a little weary flicker of triumph . I got through the whole evening , she thought , and nothing happened . Tomorrow I 'll be fresh and I 'll take hold . As she drifted off to sleep she heard the voices of Oliverand Tony , low , friendly , intimate , on the other side of the bedroom door and the male tread of their footsteps going down the hallway to the guest room at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thought . Both of them . She wondered whether Oliver would come into her room to sleep tonight . And if he did , for whom would he be doing it ? Himself ? Her ? Tony ? She folded her arms across her breasts and held her shoulders , because she was shivering with cold . She was asleep when Oliver came into the darkened room , and the careful sounds he made as he undressed and got into the bed did n't awaken her.  |p224Usually  she awoke fairly early , but on this Thanksgiving morning , she slept till past ten o'clock , and when she woke she felt heavy and hangover-ish . She moved slowly as she washed and combed her hair , and she dressed with more care than she ordinarily took in the mornings . Whatever opinion he has of me , she thought grimly , at least he 's goingto admit that his mother is not bad-looking . She heard no sounds in the rest of the house and she took it for granted that Oliver and Tony were either in the living room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But when she went down she saw that the house was empty , shining in the morning sunlight , with two sets of breakfast dishes neatly washed and left in the wire frame on one side of the kitchen sink to dry . There was a note on the kitchen table in Oliver 's handwriting , and she hesitated before picking it up and reading it , disturbed by absurd fears that there would be news in it of departures , discoveries , denunciations . But when she picked it up and read it , all it said was that they 'd had their breakfast and they had n't wanted to wake her and that since it was such a fine morning they were going to a high-school football game in town that was to start at eleven o'clock . They would be back , the note went on , in Oliver 's precise and authoritative handwriting , not much later than one-thirty and they would be ready for the turkey . Love , Oliver , it ended . She was grateful for the respite and she bustled around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cook , roasting and shelling the chestnuts , moving swiftly and automatically about her chores , glad that the maid had been given the week-end off and that she had to do the work herself and that she had the house all to herself to do it in . When , during the morning , flushed from her work and the heat of the oven , she thought of Tony , it was almost carelessly . It all seemed so normalp225in how many homes throughout the country was the son of the house back from school for the holiday and out watching a football game with his father while the mother prepared the standard feast . And if Tony had not been wildly affectionate the evening before , that was to be expected . He had n't been antagonistic , either . His attitude , if it had been an attitude , could be described as neutral . A little warmer and better than neutral , Lucy corrected herself , basting the bird . She hummed comfortably to herself in the sunny kitchen . After all , two years is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a boy . A lot of things are forgotten in two years  --  or at least blurred over and softened . She herself , she thought comfortably , setting the table , could n't remember clearly just what had happened two years ago and it had all flattened out and lost the power of damaging her . At this distance it was hard to remember just why everybody had made such a crisis out of it . Looking at the table , with the linen white , the glasses shining , she regretted for an instant that it was only going to be the three of them for the meal . It would have been nice to have some other families in , and other boys and girls Tony 's age . She closed her eyes and imagined what the table would look like , with the grownups at one end and five or six boys and girls , scrubbed , in their best clothes , the girls at that marvelous , shining age when from moment to moment they teetered back and forth between being children and young women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrange something big . Standing there , looking at the glittering table and thinking about Christmas , she was happier than she had been in many years . She glanced at her watch , went into the kitchen to take a last look around and sniff , luxuriously , all the warm and pungent smells of the dinner . Then she went upstairs andp226took a long time surveying the dresses hanging in her closet , trying to decide which one might please Tony best . She chose a soft blue dress with a wide skirt and a high neck and long sleeves . Today , she thought , he 'd probably prefer me to look motherly . Oliver and Tony came back at a quarter to two , both of them flushed from the cold and entertained by the game they had seen . Lucy was waiting for them in the living room , in her motherly dress , proud that everything had been efficiently prepared , with fifteen minutes to spare , and that they could find her sitting in the orderly , bright room , calm , leisurely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door and the pleasant male mumbleof their voices , and when they entered the room she smiled at them , secretly observing that while he was undoubtedlyOliver 's son , his resemblance to her , the wide brow , the long gray eyes , the fine blond hair , was overwhelminglystrong . " God , it smells good in here , " Oliver said . He had obviouslyenjoyed his morning and he was smiling and full of energy and the nervousness and somber watchfulness of the night before had vanished . He only glanced at her briefly but she could tell that he was pleased with her . Perhaps it was n't all quite real  --  perhaps it was all preparedand staged , his glance told her , but it was well staged . " We met Fred Collins and his daughter at the game , " Oliver said , standing in front of the fire , " and I invited them up here for a drink on the way home . They 'll be here in a minute . Is the ice out ? " He looked over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as a bar . " Yes , " Lucy said , satisfied with herself because she had thought of that , too , because today she was thinking of everything . She smiled up at the two of them , standing side by side in front of the fire , in their tweeds and flannelp227trousers , the boy almost as tall as the father , filling the room with a sense of the crisp holiday outdoor morning . Tony looked at home , as though he was familiar with every corner of the room , as though he had lived here a long time and could move about the house carelessly and without strangeness . " Did you like the game ? " Lucy asked . " It was a pretty good game , " Tony said . " There 's a fullbackwho 's going to go places in college , if they do n't break his neck for him first . " " Do you like football ? " Lucy said . " Uhuh , " said Tony . " As long as I 'm not expected to root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ searching look , and Lucy thought , I must stop asking him direct questions about himself . The answers always are a little queer , and not what you would really want to hear from your son . Disturbed , she stood up and went over to the bar and fussed , getting out glasses , with her back to Oliver and Tony . She was relieved when the doorbell rang a few seconds later and Oliver went to the front hall to let in Fred Collins and his daughter . There was a kind of roaring at the front door because Fred Collins talked like that . West was to talk at the top of your voice at all times . He was a big man with a crushing handshake and he still affected a wide-brimmed , vaguely Texan kind of felt hat and he drank a good deal and organized poker games and he was always taking Oliveroff to go hunting for deer and birds . Twice a year he discovered prize fighters who would make everybody forgetJoe Louis and he had once taken Oliver all the way out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three rounds by a Puerto Rican . Although she hadp228never seen him put to the test , Lucy believed that he was generous and good-hearted and she was grateful to him for taking Oliver off so many evenings of the year and on the protracted trips to hunting camps and distant arenas . He had a pretty , rather washed-out-looking wife whom he called Sweetheart and whom he treated with the cumbrousgallantry of a bear in the zoo . His daughter Betty was only fifteen years old , small , honey-colored , confident of herself , coldly coquettish , and , as Lucy described her privately , ripening daily into wickedness . Even Oliver , who was among the least susceptible of men , confessed that when Betty Collins came into a room , she made him uncomfortable . " I 'm telling you , 011ie , " Collins was saying , his words clearly discernible in the living room , " that boy is a find . Did you see the way he cut back when they piled up in front of him at the tackles ? He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his discoveries of fighters who would make everybody forget Joe Louis by discoveries of backs who would make everybody forget Red Grange . " I 'm going to write my old coach at Oregon and tell him about this boy , and maybe get to him with an offer . We could use him out there . " Collins had left college more than twenty years before , and he had n't been back in Oregonfor more than a decade , but his loyalty never wavered . He was also loyal to the American Legion , of which he was an officer , several secret societies , and to the New Jersey State Republican Committee , which was at the momentrocking under the hammer-blows of the Roosevelt dynasty . " Do n't you agree , 011ie ? " Collins asked , invisible but loud . " He 'd really be something in Oregon , would n't he ? " " You 're absolutely right , Fred , " Lucy heard Oliver murmur , approaching down the hall . Collins was the only person who ever had called him 011ie . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't ever complained about it . The men came into the room , herding Betty in front of them . Betty smiled at Lucy and said , " Hello , Mrs. Crown , " in the voice that , as much as anything else about her , made men uncomfortable in her presence . Collins stopped melodramatically at the doorway . " By God , " he roared , spreading his arms like a wrestler preparing to grapple an opponent . " What a vision ! Now , here 's something really to be thankful for ! 011ie , if I was a churchgoing man , I 'd go to church this afternoon and praise the Lord for making your wife so beautiful . " He advanced on her , rolling archly . " I ca n't resist it , Ma'am , I just ca n't resist it , " he shouted , taking her into his arms . " You 're getting prettier every day . Son , " he said to Tony , who was standing at the doorway , watching carefully , " with your permission I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and because she 's the loveliest lady on this side of the Mississippi River . " Without waiting for an answer from Tony , Collins gripped her tight , the wrestler coming to close quarters , and kissed her loudly on each cheek . Almost smothered by the man 's bulk , Lucy laughed , a little uneasily , permitting herself to be kissed , because if you allowed Collins into the house you had to take him with all his noise and all his rough-hewn and boisterous gallantry . She had a glimpse , past Collins ' head , of Tony . Tony was n't looking at her now , but had turned and was watching Oliver with an expression of scientific interest on his face . Lucy could n't see Oliver , and Collins pressed her heartilyto his barrel-like chest once more , crying , incomprehensibly , but with the best will in the world , " Venus ! Venus ! " Then , winking broadly and rolling his head lewdly , he said , in a loud stage whisper , " Baby , my car is waiting , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . The first night of the new moon . Watch out for me , 011ie , boy , watch out for me . She brings out my tiger blood . " He roared with laughter and let her go . " That 's enough , now , Fred , " Lucy said , knowing how ineffectual it must sound in the midst of all that bellowing and lip-smacking . She looked over again at Tony , but his eyes were fixed on his father , coolly , expectantly . But Oliver did n't seem to notice . He had seen so much of Collins in the last year that the noise and confusion that surrounded him by now seemed normal , as the sound of a waterfall finally seems almost like silence to people who live next to it . Collins finally released her and sank expansively onto the couch , pulling his daughter down beside him and fondling her hand in his . " Ah , these cushions feel good , " he said . " Those benches at the game are awfully rough on the derriere . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a fine-looking boy , Lucy . A little stringy so far , eh , Son , but that 's the age for it . When I was your age you may not believe it , but I only weighed a hundred and thirty-five pounds , soaking wet . " He laughed loudly , as though what he had said had been irresistibly witty . " We 're glad we finally met the young Crown prince , are n't we , Honey ? " He peered lovingly into his daughter 's eyes . Betty looked consideringly at Tony , using her lashes . " Yes , Daddy , " she said . " Yes , Daddy , " Collins mimicked her in a quivering falsetto . " Oh , the volumes that 're concealed in those two simple words . Yes , Daddy . " He leaned over and kissed her cheek , entranced with his own vision of his daughter . " Bewarethis girl , Son , " he said . " She has her eye on you . I recognize the signs . Consider yourself lucky and beware ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up their next year 's allowance for that little Yes , Daddy . "  | " Now , Daddy , stop . . . " Betty said , tapping her father'shand reprovingly . " When we went through the stands to our seats this morning , " Collins said , booming , " you could hear the sigh of desire sweeping across the cheering section like the wind through a field of wheat . " He laughed fondly , proud , overt , simple-minded . Oliver , who was standing by the fire now , next to Tony , laughed , too . Tony looked at him , unamused , icily puzzled . " Say , Betty , " Collins said , " are n't you going to a dance tonight ? " " Yes , " the girl said . " Why do n't you take Tony along with you ? " Collins said . " If he 's half the man his daddy is , I 'll bet he 'll be able to show you a thing or two . " Nervously , Lucy glanced at Tony . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins were an animal he had never seen before and which he was trying to place in its proper category . " Well , I 'd love to , " Betty said , smiling at Tony , using her medium artillery . " I honestly would . But I promised Chris I 'd let him take me and . . . " " Chris , Chris ! " Collins waved impatiently . " You know you have no use for him . We ca n't let Tony just mope around with the old folks on his holiday . Let ' em both take you . " " Well , of course , that would be lovely , " Betty said , and Lucy was sure the girl was calculating secretly the impactof the moment of her arrival at the dance with a boy on each arm . " If Tony would like to . . . " " Of course Tony would like to , " Collins said . " You beat our house at nine o'clock tonight , Son , and . . . " " I 'm sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this evening , " He spoke very quietly and it cut into the booming . tor/rent of Collins ' sound , coldly polite , uninterested , a rebuke to the loud and foolish father and the coquettish and triumphantdaughter . There was nothing boyish or hesitant about it . It was an adult and chilly snub , fastidiously administered . Betty did not mistake it . She glanced thoughtfullyat Tony , annoyed and interested , her face open for a moment , revealed . Then she dropped her eyes , covering up . Where did he learn to behave like this , Lucy wondered . What has he had to do with girls in the past two years that makes him so sure of himself ? And seeing Collins now through Tony 's eyes , she realized , painfully , that as recentlyas a year ago , Oliver would never have permitted either the man or his daughter to enter the house . Collins did n't miss it either . He narrowed his eyes , measuring Tony , understanding antagonism . The room was uneasily silent , the atmosphere strained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was undisturbed . Then Collins patted his daughter 's hand protectively . " Well , " he said , " you had your chance , Son . " He turned to Oliver . " Did n't you say something about a drink , O11ie ? " " Oh , I 'm sorry , " Oliver said . " What 'll it be ? " " Martinis , " Collins said . " It 's the only drink for Thanksgiving . " He laughed , emptily , reaching for his wavering assurance . Oliver started to put the ice into the shaker and open a bottle of gin . They all watched him with exaggerated interest , trying to ignore the breach that Tony had opened between them . " No , no , no , " Collins said , jumping up . " You 're drowningit in vermouth , lad . " He went over to the bar and took the shaker from Oliver 's hand . " You 'll ruin the holiday , 011ie ! Here , let me make it , let the old martini-master get to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relinquished the gin bottle , too . " We usually drink whisky and I . . . " " It 's all in the wrist , all in the wrist , my boy , " Collins said , pouring elaborately , squinting with one eye . " I learned it from an old Indian out in the big woods . . . " " I 'll do it . " It was Tony . He had moved , unhurried , between the two men , and he took the shaker from Collins ' hand . Collins stood there , his mouth open foolishly , his hand still curved in the position it had been in when he was holding the shaker . " In this house , Mr. Collins , " Tony said , " we supply our own bartenders . " Calmly , Tony poured the gin and the vermouth and began to mix the drink , staring at Oliver , rebuking him silentlyand pitilessly . " Sure , sure . . . " Collins said . He shrugged , disciplined , wanting to react , not knowing just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dismissed . Tony stood next to the bar , stirring , ignoring Collins , looking steadily and contemptuously at his father . Oliver met his eye briefly , smiled uncomfortably , and moved away . " Well , " he said , more loudly than was necessary , " that 's the advantage of sending your son to a good school . They teach him to make martinis . " He laughed , falsely , and Lucy felt she could n't stay in the room a moment longer . She sprang up from her chair . " If you 'll excuse me , " she said , " I have to go and see that the dinner is n't burning up . " She fled into the kitchen , making sure the door was shut tight behind her , so that she would n't hear what they were saying in the living room . She worked distractedly , uselessly , not paying attention to what she was doing , wishing that the day was over , the week-end , the year . . . Oh , God , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the game ? Why could n't it have been raining , so that they would never have left the house ? Why did Oliver have to invite him over ? Why did I let him kiss me ? Why does Oliver let him call him 011ie ? She put the turkey on the platter and the sweet potatoes around it and the gravy in a boat and the cranberry sauce in a bowl . Then she sat down next to the window , staringout at the graying afternoon , her hands folded desolatelyin her lap , waiting until she heard the voices die down in the living room , and a few minutes later , the sound of Collins ' car going off down the street . Then she ' carried the holiday turkey into the dining room , smiling almost correctly , crying , " Dinner , dinner , " knowing that nothing was going to be any good . Tony hardly talked during the meal and Oliver talked too much , drinking almost a whole bottle of wine , and making a rambling speech about politics and taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of food , looking over their heads , not waiting for answers . After the meal was over , Oliver said he had promised Collins he was going to walk over to his house for a brandy . He asked Tony and Lucy if they wanted to go with him and seemed relieved when Tony said , " No , " and Lucy said that she was tired and wanted to take a nap . Oliver went out of the house , humming , loudly , a march that the high-school band had played between the halves that morning . For a moment , left alone at the cluttered table with Tony , Lucy thought that , finally , she could talk to him , and , by saying the exact , right word , cure them all . But Tony 's face was still and removed and she got up from the table and said , " Leave everything , I 'll clear it up later , " and went up to her bedroom without looking back . She lay down on the bed and dozed a bit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close in her dreamsp235and there were steps in a shadowy , distant hallway and a final soft thud of a faraway door shutting . When she woke , unrefreshed , she went down to the livingroom and it was without surprise that she saw the note on the library table . She picked it up and took the note out of the envelope and read , still unsurprised , in Tony 's handwriting , that he had decided that it would be better if he went back to school . " I despise what you have done to my father , " he wrote , and what you have made him turn into and I do n't want to see him again in this house with you and with the kind of friends you have driven him to . " There was something that had been heavily scratched out at the end of the letter and for a while she did n't bother to try to decipher it . She sat wearily in the dimmingNovember afternoon light , the letter in her hand , oppressed by accident and failure . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely at the scratched-out sentence that ended the note . She puzzled over it , holding it directly under the lamp light , and after a minute or two she saw what Tony had put there . " I repudiate you , " he had written , and she wondered why he had taken the trouble to cross it out.  |p236And  the ' next time she saw him was through the cigarette smoke at the bar in Paris , with the noise of the piano behind her and the Negro singing " Le piano des pauvres " with a broad Harlem accent , and the college boy holding her hand among the beer-glasses on the table . How many years between the somber November twilightand the club owner saying , nastily , " Let me advise you , Madame , to telephone first . Mr. Crown is married . To a beautiful and charming lady " ? Sixteen years . And a war won and lost ; Oliver dead ; age accepted or nearly accepted ; everything repaired , or almost repaired ; revisions accomplished ; pain and loss misted over by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thought , of causing further harm . She slept very little that night , in the high-ceilinged , old-fashioned hotel room , the wide , lumpy bed crowded against the wall by a huge , dark armoire whose door she could n't quite close and which creaked gently and warn/ingly from time to time in the darkness , disturbed by the wind that came in through the slit of the iron shutters at the window . She lay in the bed , listening to the obscure complaints of the armoire door , on the edge of sleep , changing her mind a dozen times , deciding to leave the next morning , deciding to go to the address the man had written down for her at the bar , deciding to act as though she had never seen Tony , and go sightseeing the next day , as she had planned , the Louvre , Versailles , the walk along the river , deciding to jump up immediately and call him on the telephone and say . . . what ? " This is your mother . Do you still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into a night club a few hours ago and guess who I saw standing at the bar . . She fell asleep , remembering his face , so much like the other face , dead and almost forgotten , remembering the child 's face from which it had been formed , narrow , softskinned , with the speckled gray eyes which were so much like hers . It was early , not much past eight o'clock , when she woke in the morning , with the sound of the Vespa 's and motorbikesand trucks coming in off the street . She lay still , listening uncomfortably , not remembering for an instant , but conscious that something had changed , feeling no longer like a tourist , but like a victim , in the strange , shaded room . Then she remembered and understood why she felt that way . She made herself get out of bed and look at the clock . She regretted that she had not slept later , because if she had , she would have been able to tell herself that it was too late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at work . . . She bathed , in cool water , to try to wake herself up , and dressed hurriedly and mechanically , anxiously looking atp238the clock , like a woman with a train to catch . She looked in the mirror before leaving the room . She stared curiouslyat herself , wondering what he would see when they met . Even in the daylight , she realized without vanity , even with so little sleep , she did n't look so bad . Her eyes were clear , the skin smooth , she did n't need any make-up except a little lipstick because she was tanned , the dark blond of her hair was highlighted by the strawy streaks that always came out in it when she stayed in the sun . She put on a hat and started out , then stopped and took the hat off and threw it on the bed . She did n't wear a hat except on ceremonial occasions , and she did n't want this to be a ceremonial occasion . She brushed her hair nervouslyonce more , then , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lying open on its stand and reached into the pocket under the top lid and took out a wrinkled , crumbling envelope . Carefully , she put the envelope into her bag and went out of the room . Downstairs , she hailed a taxi , and managed to make the driver understand the address in only two tries . As she settled on the seat in back , and the taxi started off down the cool , tree-lined street , she had a small feeling of triumph . Perhaps it 's an omen , she thought . Maybe today I can communicate with everybody . Bouncing on the rough springs of the taxi seat , moving swiftly along the foreign streets , she did n't know exactly what she wished to communicate to her son . It was difficult , even , to know just why she was going to see him or what she expected from the visit . She just knew that it had to be done . It was like opening a door to a long corridor in a dream and feeling that for some reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be necessary to go to the end of the corridor . The taxi stopped in front of an apartment house on ap239quiet street and she got out and paid the driver , trying to control the slight shaking of her hands . Before going in , she looked at the face of the house . It was of anonymous gray stone , rather shabby and weatherbeaten , one of those buildings which have very little beauty in themselves but which combine , somehow , in Paris , with the similar buildingsaround them , to make a soberly pleasant pattern on street after street of the city . At home , she realized , people who lived in a house like that would move to another neighborhood as soon as a rise in salary came along . She went in and said clearly to the fat blond woman in the concierge 's room , " Monsieur Crown , s'il vous plait . " " Troisieme , a gauche , " the concierge said , looking at her sharply , suspecting everything . Lucy translated laboriously for herself and pushed the button @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dark when she got out and she fumbled for more than a minute before she found the button of the doorbell , to the left of the elevator shaft . She heard the bell ring inside the apartment , and the muffled sound of a vacuum cleaner somewhere else in the building , insistent and annoying . The door did not open , and Lucy rang again , hoping guiltily that there was no one home , that she could make her way down the dark stairway and into the street and away from the building without having to come face to face with her son . She was just about to turn away when she heard steps within and the door opened . A young woman stood there , in a pink wrapper , a young , small woman with short dark hair , outlined against bright sunlight that poured into the hallway behind her . Lucy could n't see her face , just the small , slender silhouette against the light.  | " Mrs. Crown ? " Lucy said . " Yes . " The woman stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is Mr. Crown in ? " Lucy asked . " No . " The woman made a quick , inquisitive movement of her head , as though she was trying to get a better look at Lucy . " Will he be back soon ? " Lucy asked . " I do n't know , " the woman said . Her voice was cool and unfriendly . " I do n't know when he 'll be back . Who shall I say called ? " " My name is Crown , " Lucy said , feeling ridiculous . " I 'm his mother . " They stood silently for a moment , facing each other . Then the woman chuckled drily . " Come in , " she said , taking Lucy 's arm . " It 's about time we got to know each other . " She led Lucy down the hall and into the living room . The room was cluttered and a breakfast tray was set on a low table in front of the couch , with a half-drunk cup of coffee , a smoldering cigarette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editorial page . " Well , now , " the woman said , turning toward her , smilinga little . " Welcome to Paris . " It was hard to tell whether the words and the smile that went with them were derisive or not , and Lucy stood there , waiting , cautious , uncomfortable , on foreign and uncertain ground . " First , " the woman said , staring directly at Lucy , " I suppose I ought to introduce myself . Or do you know my name ? " " No , " said Lucy , " I 'm afraid I . . . " " Dora , " the woman said . " And I know yours . Wo n't you sit down ? And can I get you a cup of coffee ? "  | " Well , " Lucy said , " if Tony 's not here . . . I would n't like to interfere with your morning . " " I have nothing to do with my morning , " the girl said , " I 'll go get another cup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floating through the beams of sunlight that came in through the open windows . Lucy sat down on a straight chair , looking around her at the room . It was a room that had seen better days . The paint was old and soiled , the rugs threadbare . It gave an impression of rented furniture , things slightly out of repair , a provisional and careless existence . Only two large , brilliant paintings on the wall , abstract and nervous , gave the feeling of personal choice , ownership . They must be poor , Lucy thought , or nearly poor . Where did all the money go ? Dora came back , carrying a cup and saucer . While she was pouring the coffee , Lucy examined her obliquely . She was very young , with deep black eyes , and a heavy mass of dark hair pulled back from her forehead with attractive austerity . She had a pointed small face and a wide , full mouth , whose sensuality was accentuated and made somehowdisturbing by the paleness of her skin . With a cigarettehanging from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low table as she poured the coffee , Dora 's face seemed marked by resignation and a permanent dissatisfaction . Maybe it 's the style for the young married set this year , Lucy thought , accepting the cup and saucer . Maybe this year they have decided to look dissatisfied . " Well , now , at last , " Dora said , seating herself directly across from Lucy in a low , rumpled easy chair . " I 'm sorry Tony is n't here to do the honors . " " Has he gone out already ? " Lucy asked . " No , " Dora said , without expression . " He has n't come in yet . "  | " Does he work at night ? " Lucy asked , confused . " No , " said Dora . " I mean . . . I saw him at two o'clock , in a bar . . Lucy stopped , embarrassed . " Did you ? " Dora said , without interest . " How was the reunion ? " " I did n't speak to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manager . " " Was he alone ? " Dora tilted her head back , finishing her coffee . " Yes . " " Fancy that . " The tone of the girl 's voice was still flat , automatic . " I 'm sorry , " said Lucy . " I do n't want to meddle . . . Perhaps I 'd better go . If you want , when he gets back , you can tell him I 'm in Paris and I 'll leave the telephone numberof my hotel and if he . . . " " Do n't go , do n't go , " the girl said . " You 're not meddling . And he 's liable to come in any minute . Or any week . " She laughed drily . " Oh , it 's not as bad as you think , " she said . " Or anyway , I like to tell myself it 's not as bad as people think . He has a studio near here and sometimes when he 's working hard or when he ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you saw him at a bar at two o'clock , I guess he was n't working very hard last night , though . " " A studio ? " Lucy asked . " What does he do in a studio ? " " Do n't you know ? " Dora asked , sounding surprised . " No . The last time I heard from him was during the war , when he got the news that his father had been killed , " said Lucy . " He wired me that he did n't intend to come to the funeral services . " " That sounds like him . " The girl looked amused . " He ca n't stand ceremonies . If our own wedding had lasted another five minutes , he 'd have run like a deer . " Shep243paused , grimacing a little , lighting another cigarette , lookingup at the ceiling over Lucy 's head , as though remembering the wedding . " I do n't suppose you knew he was married , either , did you ? " " No . " " Well , he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the moment , he 's married . No guarantees go along with this purchase . " She chuckled briefly . She 's not as hard as she wants me to think she is , Lucy thought , studying the pale , youthful , bitter face . Perhaps that 's the style , too . Or she has learned to put it on to live with her husband . " You wanted to know what he does in a studio , " Dora said . " He 's a cartoonist . He draws funny pictures for the magazines . Did n't you know that , either ? " " No , " said Lucy . It seemed like an improbable profession for a son of hers to be following . Naively , the word cartoonistmade her think of clowns , comedians with funny hats , simple and light-hearted young men . The glimpse she had had of Tony the night before had suggested none of these things . And certainly , when he was a boy he had been serious enough . " It 's true , he used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't terribly good , though . " " I imagine he 's improved a bit , " the girl said . " In that direction , anyway . " " But I 've never seen his name . . . " " He does n't draw under his own name . I think he 's ashamed of it . If he could do anything else , he 'd quit . " " What does he want to do ? " The girl shrugged . " Nothing . Or at least nothing that he 's ever told me . " " Does he do well ? " Lucy asked . " Well enough , " she said . " We eat . If we went back to America , he probably could make a lot of money . He 's notp244very interested . His tastes 're simple . Awful but simple . " She smiled bleakly . " And he never showed any desire to shower his wife with mink . " " Why does n't he want to go back to America ? " Lucy asked , hoping for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her coldly . " He says he got used to living in exile when he was young , and he 'd feel uncomfortable changing the pattern . And he says he likes living in France best of all , because the French are in despair and he admiresthat . " What conversations must have gone on in this shabby room , Lucy thought , what hurtful , desolate interchanges ! " Why does he talk like that ? " she asked . The girl looked at her levelly . " You tell me , " she said . Lucy hesitated . " Some other time , " she said . " He sounds like a terribly difficult man . " Dora laughed . It sounded as though it had been choked out of her . " Lady , " she said , " what a gift for description you have . " She is not my friend , Lucy thought . Whatever else she may turn out to be , she is not my friend . " Ah , I should n't talk like that , " Dora said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a monster . We 've been married five years and he 's given me some rough times , and there 's always the chance he 'll come home one day and tell me we 're finished  --  in fact , I 'm sure it 's going to happen eventually  --  and yet , I would n't change it , I would n't change any of it . It 's been worth it , " she said harshly , as though challenging Lucy to deny it . " No matter how it ends , it 's been worth it . " Then , with an obvious effort , she checked herself . " Oh , you 'll see for yourself , " she said lightly , " when you talk to him . Inside of twenty minutes , he 'll probably charm you into feeling that he 's the most devoted and loving son who ever lived . If he wants , he'llp245convince you that he really has been trying to reach you on the telephone for twenty years , only you just happened to be out the times he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy said . She felt nervous and unlucky and she had to hold her hands together to keep them from fidgeting . Bad luck , bad luck , she thought . Tony not there , when she had herself all prepared , finally , to confront him  --  and instead , this hostile , unhappy , cynical , pathetic girl , with her disturbing revelations about him , with her little anthology of her husband 's bitter aphorisms on exile and despair , her challenging , open devotion in the face of neglect , or worse than neglect . " Oh , " the girl was saying , suddenly polite and hostesslike , " that 's enough about me . I 'd love to hear something about you now . You look so young . . . " " I 'm not so young , " Lucy said . " I knew you were beautiful . Tony told me , " the girl said , sounding genuine and artless , her eyes smiling , lookingdirectly at Lucy , unexpectedly approving of her , as though she had decided to observe her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to what was behind the smartly cut dark blond hair , the wide , deep eyes , the large , youthful , pleasant mouth . " But it just never occurred to me that you could look like this  --  that when I saw you , it would still all be there like this . . . " " It really is n't still all there , my dear , " Lucy said . " You ought to see my mother . " Dora chuckled mischievously . " Garden-club type . Light-heavyweight division . When she decided to let herself go , she took the longest cruise that was being offered . " The two women laughed together , a gossipy , feline , comfortablelaugh . " You must hang around , " Dora said , " and teach me the trick . I never 've been able to stand the idea of growing old.  |p246When  I was sixteen , I made a holy vow tp myself  --  to commit suicide on my fortieth birthday . Maybe you can save me from that . " The trick , Lucy thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadowy within her , the trick is to suffer and be alone and never be certain enough of anything to fall back comfortably and know that someoneis there to catch you . The trick , if you 're interested , is to struggle constantly . " It 's a shame it is n't afternoon , " Dora said . " We ought to have a drink to celebrate meeting each other , after all these years . " She looked inquiringly at Lucy . " Would you think it was sinful to have a drink at this hour of the morning ? " Lucy looked at her watch . It was nine-thirty-five . " Well . . . " she said doubtfully . She had known several women who were constantly looking for excuses to drink at all hours of the day and night . Maybe that was it , maybe that was why Tony kept away from his home so much . . . The girl giggled . " Do n't look at me like that , " she said , understanding . " I 've never had a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , pleased with the girl 's perceptiveness . " I think it would be a wonderful idea , " she said . Dora stood up and went over to a small , marble-topped table against the wall , on which stood some glasses and bottles . She poured Scotch and a little soda into two glasses . Her movements were precise and graceful and she looked like a serious and slender child with her head inclined to one side , measuring out the drinks . Watching her , Lucy felt a sharp twinge of dislike for her son , for causing pain to a girl like that , who , because of her beauty , must have expected , ever since her first look in a mirror , that kindness , forbearance and love would be the constant climate of her life . Dora offered her a glass . " At French festivals , in littlep247towns , " she said , " they often drink in the morning . A lot of people are invited and they advertise it in the local newspaperas the Verre d'Amitie , or the Coupe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she translated conscientiously , " or the cup of honor . What should we call this ? " " Well , let me see , " Lucy said , " how about a little bit of both ? " " A little bit of both . " Dora nodded and raised her glass , and they drank . Dora rolled the liquor around on her tongue , considering it . " Now I know why people drink in the morning . It tastes so much more significant in the morning , does n't it ? " " Yes , it does , " Lucy agreed . The flavor of hostility had vanished and she was beginning to feel very much at home with the girl and approving of her son , at least in this one respect , for having chosen her . " Now , " Dora said , between sips , " I 've talked enough about myself and Tony . How about you ? What 're you doinghere ? Touring ? " " Only partly , " Lucy said . " I work for an organization in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the United Nations . It devotes itself to children . We sort of meddle all over the world , making politicians uncomfortableif they do n't take a proper stand on child-labor and voting credits for schools and making sure all the little citizens are vaccinated and eligible for a few pints of milk a year . And we 're very stern about illegitimate children getting full rights before the law . Things like that . " She spoke lightly , but her pride in the work she was doing and her fundamental seriousness about it were not disguised . " And a lot of money comes our way from people in America , and we decide how it 's to be spent . I 've been roaming around Europe for five weeks now , looking solemn at meetings and taking notes and patting small dark heads in Greece and Yugoslavia and Sicily . I had a conference lastp248night and everything had to be translated into three languagesand it did n't end till after one A.M. and I was famishedwhen I got back to my hotel , because I missed my dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and see Tony . . . " " You sound like a very important person , " Dora said , youthfully impressed . " Do you give press conferences and all that ? " " Occasionally . " Lucy smiled . " I 'm very strong on birth control . " " I never did anything , " Dora said absently , twirling her glass . " I did n't even finish college . I came over here for a vacation in my sophomore year and I met Tony and there went college . . . It must be a wonderful thing to feel useful . " " It is , " Lucy said soberly , meaning it . " Maybe when Tony finally leaves me , " Dora said matterof-factly , " I 'll take steps to become useful . " The door from the dining room was slowly pushed open and a small boy 's head appeared , poking out behind it . " Mummy , " the boy said , " Yvonne says this afternoon is her day off and if you say all right she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three birds in a cage . " " Come in here , Bobby , " Dora said , " and say hello . " " I have to tell Yvonne , " the boy said . " Right away . " But he came into the room , shyly ignoring Lucy , straightbacked , sturdy , with thoughtful gray reminiscent eyes and a domed , long head . His hair was cut close and he was wearingshorts and a knitted shirt and his bare arms and legs , scarred by the usual mishaps and antiseptics of childhood , were straight and surprisingly strong-looking . Lucy watched him , feeling dazed , forgetting to smile , rememberingwhat Tony had looked like at that age . Why did n't she tell me they had a son , Lucy thought , aggrieved and mistrustful once again , feeling that somehow Dora hadp249purposely and with some ulterior motive held back this key piece of information . " This is your grandmother , " Dora was saying , smoothing the boy 's hair gently . " Say hello , Bobby . " Silently , his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put out his hand . They shook hands gravely . Then , unable to resist it , and at the risk of frightening or offendingthe boy , Lucy took him in her arms and kissed him . Bobby stood politely , waiting to be released . Lucy held onto him , not because she wanted to prolong the kiss , but because if she let him go , she was afraid that he would see her crying . Now , suddenly , with her arms around the bony shoulders , with the soft , firm child 's skin under her fingers , the sense of loss , of wasted years , which until then had been only abstract and theoretical , became real , painful , sadly and powerfully fleshed . She bent her head and kissed the bristly , little-boy 's hair , smelling the dry , fresh , forgotten odor of childhood . She was conscious of Dora watching her . She took a deep breath and held back the tears . She released the boy , making herself smile at him . " Robert , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " The boy went back and stood next to his mother , silent . " Tell your grandmother how old you are , Bobby , " said Dora . " My grandmother is fat , " the boy said . " That 's your other grandmother , " Dora said , " that 's the one who was here last year . " " Four , " the boy said . " My birthday is in the wintertime . " There was the sound of a key in the lock and footsteps in the hallway . Then Tony came into the room . He stopped when he saw Lucy , and looked , puzzled , politely , not recognizingher for the moment , from her to Dora . He was in the same clothes that he had been wearing the night before and they looked rumpled , as if he had slept in them . Hep250seemed tired and he needed a shave and he blinked once or twice , coming out of the darkness of the elevator shaft into the bright sunlight of the living room . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Daddy , " the boy said , " Mummy says I can go with Yvonne this afternoon to her sister-in-law . She has three birds in a cage . " " Hello , Tony , " Lucy said . She stood up . Tony shook his head , quickly , two or three times . " Well , now , " he said softly . He did n't smile . " Your mother and I have been having a visit , " Dora said . Tony 's eyes traveled from their faces to the whisky glasses set down before them . " So I see , " he said . He smiled . But the smile was chilly and withdrawn . " What a nice idea , " he said . He put out his hand and Lucy took it formally . Then he turned to the boy . For a moment , he stood in silence , seeming to be studying his son , puzzled , intense , loving , as though searching for some minute , hiddensecret in the soft , pleased , welcoming child 's face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . How much he loves his son . " Robert , " Tony said gravely , " how would you like to be a messenger this morning ? " " It depends , " the boy said cautiously , sensing dismissal . " How would you like to go in and tell Yvonne that your father would like some bacon and eggs and a large pot of coffee ? " " Then can I come back here ? " the boy asked , bargaining . Tony looked at his wife , then at Lucy . " Of course , " he said . " In fact , we insist that you come back in here . " " That 's what I 'm going to tell Yvonne , " the boy said . " In fact , you insist . " " Exactly , " Tony said.  |p251The  boy ran out of the room toward the kitchen . Tony watched him soberly as he went through the door , then turned back toward Lucy and Dora . " Well , " he said , " where do we begin ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'd better get out of here . I 'll dress and take Bobby with me and . . . " No , " Lucy said , more loudly than she wanted to speak . The idea of staying alone with Tony in the shabby , provisionallyfurnished room , waiting for Dora and the boy to leave , was unbearable to her . She needed time and neutral ground . " I think , if you want to see me , Tony , it 'd be better if we made it later . " " Whatever you say , " Tony said agreeably . " I do n't want to interfere with your schedule . . . " " My schedule today , " Tony said lightly , nodding pleasantlyat her , " is to entertain my mother . Still . . . " He looked around him with a mild grimace of distaste . " I do n't blame you for wanting to get out of here . I 'll tell you what . There 's a bistro on the corner . If you do n't mind waiting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lucy said hurriedly . " That 'll be fine . " She turned toward Dora . " Good-bye , my dear . " She wanted to kiss the girl in farewell , but she could n't bring herself to make the gesture under Tony 's watchful gaze . " Thank you so much . " " I 'll take you to the door , " the girl said . Clumsily , feeling more awkward than she had felt since she was a young girl , Lucy picked up her bag and her gloves and , leaving Tony standing in the middle of the room , looking rumpled , tired , and coldly amused , she followedDora into the hallway . Dora opened the door and Lucy hesitated , half in , half out . " Do you want to tell me anything ? " she whispered . Dora thought for a moment . " Be careful , " she said . " Bep252careful of yourself . Maybe it would even be a good idea if you were n't waiting in the bistro when he gets there thirty minutes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl 's cheek . Dora did n't move . She stood there , motionless , waiting , no longer friendly . Lucy pulled back , and nervously started putting on her gloves . " You have to walk down , " Dora said . " It 's a French elevator . It only carries passengers going up . " Lucy nodded and started down the steps . She heard the door close behind her and she walked carefully down in the darkness , her heels making a cold clatter on the stone steps . The vacuum cleaner was still being used somewhere in the building and the jittery , throbbing noise , like giant insects in a dream , pursued her until she reached the street.  |p253She  walked aimlessly for fifteen minutes , looking at the strange shop windows without really seeing what was in them , then hurried back to the corner of the street on which Tony lived . The bistro was there as he had said and there were several tables on a little terrace outside , under an awning , and she sat down and ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The scene in the apartment had unnerved her . Through the years , she had thought , of course , from time to time , of seeing Tony again , but in her imaginings of the encounter , it had usually been at a moment of drama  --  with her on her deathbed and Tony summoned to her side , youthful , gentle , forgiving in the face of the ultimate farewell . Then there would be the final expression of love , a last , healing kiss ( although the face to be kissed had alwaysstubbornly remained a thin , thirteen-year-old face , browned by the sun of that distant summer )  --  and then ap254miraculous recovery and a lasting reconciliation and friendshipafter it . She had also had a recurrent dream , less frequentin recent years , of Tony standing at her bedside , watching her sleep , saying , in a harsh whisper , " Die ! Die ! " But the way it had actually happened had been worse than either the bitter dream or the naive deathbed fantasy . It had been so accidental and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had recognized him at the bar and she had been embarrassed because she was sittingat a night-club table with two college boys whom she had allowed , however innocently , to pick her up . And then there was the unhealthy impression of the shabby apartmentand the disappointed wife , with her confessions of unhappiness and her despair for the future . And there had been the unexpected ache of seeing the little boy , with the almost familiar face , the mild , grave , inherited eyes , in a confusion of generations , seeming to condemn her once more across the years , putting a new and heavier burden of responsibility on her all over again . And then Tony himself  --  prematurelygray , prematurely weary , unpleasantly distant and careless with his wife , incuriously polite , unmovedand cool with herself . It was true , Lucy warned herself , that she might have been influenced by the unappetizingand perhaps distorted picture of Tony that Dora had given her before he came in . There was a good chance that Dora , nursing wifely grudges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from home , might have misrepresented the case considerably . But even so , and making all allowances for Dora 's possible exaggerations , the impression Tony had made on her was a disturbing one . And mixed up with it all was the image of her grandson , hopeful and vulnerable , caught between the failures and animosities of his parents , still too young to understand the bitter currents that were twisting his life , but inevitably top255be shaped and damaged by them . God , Lucy thought , what will he be like finally ? How long does the punishment go on ? Suddenly the memory of Tony 's smile in the disheveled living room , standing there between his wife and mother , his mouth pulled to one side in cynical amusement , seemed hateful and terrifying to her . It seemed to mock her and belittle her and endanger everything she had so carefully built up for herself since the war  --  the sense of purpose and accomplishment in her work , the feeling of having at last matured , of having come to honorable and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidents , in not being swamped by her faults , of having come into her sixth decade whole , robust and useful . Now , remembering Tony 's smile , all that was shaken , and once more she felt as she had at the end of the summer on the lake  --  uncertain , ashamed of herself , unloving . Some way , some way , she thought , I must get him to stop smiling like that . She felt rushed and inefficient and she was frightened of the meeting that was ahead of her . What could she hope to accomplish here , in a few minutes , over a cup of coffee ? There was a lifetime to be explained , an abyss to be bridged , and these things were not to be done in a half hour at a bistro table . She needed time , all the time she could get , and an atmosphere different from this ugly little cafe , with the stained waiters banging glassware in the background and a young man , who needed a shave and who looked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a racing form a couple of tables away . Nervously , she opened her bag and took out a small mirrorto examine her face . It looked anxious to her , and artificial , not her real face , not natural for the occasion . She put the mirror away , and was about to close the bag when she saw the letter she had taken from her valise in the hotel ..  |p256She  took the letter out of the bag , a plan slowly beginning to form in her brain . She pulled the letter out of its envelope , four sheets of flimsy paper , thin and almost transparent at the folds . She had n't read it in years , and she had only put it in her baggageat the last moment when she left America , not really understanding the impulse behind it , thinking , confusedly , Well , as long as I 'm going to be in Europe . . . She opened the letter and started reading . " Dear Mrs. Crown , " the letter began , " I am in the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your loss . " The paper was stamped with the sign of the Red Cross and the handwriting was cramped , semiliterate , painful . " I suppose you have been notified by the War Dept. about the Major but I was there with the Major and I know that people feel easier in their minds when something like this happens if they hear exactly what took place at the time from someone that was on the spot . The name of the town was Ozieres , if the censor do n't cut it out , you never know what they will pass , and I will remember it for a long time because I got hit there , too , excepting that I was lucky since I am a short man and the Major , as you remember , was a very tall man , and the machine gun must of been traversing on the same elevation and while I only got it in the shoulder and the neck ( two 30 caliber ) the Major , being taller , got hit in the lungs . If it is any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a Frenchman , too , but he was very quick and he jumped into the ditch and he never got scratched . I have been reading the papers from back home since I been in the hospital and they make it sound as though it was a parade after the breakthrough , but take it from someone who was in it , it was no parade . I was in a reconaissance squadron , attached to Corps , we had some half-tracks but mostly jeeps , and we were all over the place in those days because nobody knewp257where anybody else was and there were pockets of Germans , some of them hostile and some of them just looking to give themselves up . There was no telling what you were going to run into until you moved in and they opened fire . Then you could run and maybe call back on the radio for help if you were lucky , which was our job . I 'm not complaining , since I guess that it is the only way it could be done . As you probably know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man could n't ask for a safer or more comfortablejob than that in the ordinary run of things , but the Major was not like the usual officers you find at Corps , though I am sure they have their jobs to do back there and they do them to the best of their ability . But he was always poking around where there might be trouble , seeing for himself , and his jeep became a very familiar sight to us and he engaged personally with us in quite a few little actions of one kind and another and I am happy to say that as old as he was , he was as brave and as fearless as the day is long and cheerful and democratic . If he had a fault , it was that he exposed himself sometimes when it was n't one hundred percent necessary . Well , on the day he was killed , we were at a couple of farmhouses about five miles from Ozieres , and there was nothing doing there and we were taking a break . A Frenchman , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was from outside Ozieres , and there was a bunch of Germansmaybe i8 or 20 hiding there that wanted to give themselves up . So the Major took the Frenchman along with him and another jeep with four more guys and we took off . If you happen to be in France and see Ozieres , you will see , coming in from the north , there is a crossroads 20o yards outside the town and when we got near there , the Major stopped the jeeps and he said we better go in on foot . He cut off a stick from a hedge and he had a white towel in the jeep and he tied it onto the stick and he said to the Frenchman in French You come with me and he saidp258to me Sergeant you better come along too and he told the other boys to turn the jeeps around in case there was any trouble and to spread out a little and to try to cover us if anything went wrong . The town was all buttoned up . They got shutters on the windows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody moving anywhere and it was so quiet and peaceful you would think you were back in Iowa . The Frenchman and the Major and myself started walking up the road , with the Major in the middle and there was no sign that anything was going to happen and the Frenchman was talking in French to the Major and the Major was answering him , he said he was in France a long time ago , before the war , and that is how he picked up the language , when all of a sudden , just as we got to the crossroads , without any warning , the machine gun opened up . As I said above , I was hit in the shoulder and neck , but I managed to roll over into the ditch alongside the road just the same and the Frenchman did the same on the other side . In case you think the Frenchman was not one hundred percent on the level , let me tell you it came as much as a surprise to him as to me , and I could hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time we were laying there . The Major was out in the middle of the road and I looked up out of the ditch at him after awhile and I saw that there was nothing to be done for him . After the one burst , the Germans shut up and they were never heard from again . Anybody tells you the Germans play according to the rules of the Geneva Convention , you refer them to me , and I will show them the two holes in my shoulder and neck . Although you never can tell , they might really of wanted to give themselves up and then maybe some crazy officer showed up in town and gave them a pep talk . Anyway , the boys back at the jeeps fired a few rounds over our head at the town to show the Germans there would be trouble if they tried to come for us and one of them tookp259one of the jeeps back to the farmhouses for the Lieutenant and he showed up in record time and he came and got us , right out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Germans might open fire again at any moment . I heard the Lieutenant say He never knew what hit him while he was looking at the Major , as I said above and that is something . They put a field dressing on me and they got me back fast and I could not ask for better treatment . In case you want to correspond with the Lieutenant , his name is Lieutenant Charles C. Draper and he was very close to your husband almost like Father and Son , except that I have heard a rumor back here in the hospital that the Lieutenant was ambushed in Luxembourg , but it is only a rumor . Yours Truly , ( Sgt. ) Jack Mc Cardle. r.s . They tell me I am going to get a medical discharge and a partial disability pension . ( Sgt. ) Jack Mc Cardle . Lucy folded the letter carefully and placed it in its envelope and dropped it back into her bag . Then she saw Tony coming toward her , on the shady side of the street . At least he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least that . He walked deliberately , as though he planned each step . There was none of the exuberanceor thoughtless grace of an athlete in the way he walked , but rather the feeling of a city man who has made a conscious decision long ago to be private to himself , not to allow himself to be swept up into the tempo of the crowds around him . He was wearing his dark glasses and they seemed like an affectation , because it was a cool day and there was no glare . They seemed like a further , consciousbarrier that he was putting up between himself andp260the world , the stage props of a carefully guarded and unrelentingausterity . He stopped at the table and Lucy saw that he had shaved and put on a clean shirt and a pressed suit , sober and wellcutand expensive-looking , which he carried easily and well , making Lucy remember the care and taste with which Oliverhad always dressed . Tony 's expression was polite , but there was still the small , enigmatic twist at the corner of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims of familiarity with the smile . " You found it all right ? " Tony said , seating himself besideher . " The bistro ? " " No trouble at all , " Lucy said , noting that Tony 's voice was softer and deeper than Oliver 's had been . Tony nodded and signaled a waiter and ordered two coffees , without asking her whether she wanted another or not . " Dora told me you saw me in the bar last night , " he said . " You should have come over . " " I wanted to think about it , " Lucy said , not telling him that she had n't been sure it was he . " We could have had a bottle of champagne to celebrate , " he said . " A meeting like this would have been more fitting in the middle of the night . " He spoke mildly , his accent generalized American and hard to place , and Lucy could n't tell whether he was making fun of her or not . " Well , we 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're doinghere in France . It sounds most impressive . " " It 's not as impressive as all that , " Lucy said , searching for mockery and hurrying to turn its edge if it was there . " Protecting the new generation all over the world , " said Tony . " They can use some protecting , ca n't they ? What did you think of Bobby ? " " He 's a beautiful little boy . " " Yes , is n't he ? " Tony said objectively , admitting a fact.  | " He 'll change , though , before it 's too late . " He smiled . " When you left , he wanted to know where you 'd been all this time . " " What did you tell him ? " " Oh , I said you 'd been busy , " Tony said lightly . " That seemed to satisfy him . You know the new theory about children , I 'm sure . Tell them the truth , but only as much as they seem to want at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four , the books say . " The waiter came with their coffee and Lucy watched Tony stir the sugar into his cup . He had long hands , with the nails carelessly manicured and she remembered that until he was eight he had bitten them so badly that the cuticles had often bled . Now , the psychiatrists said , that was a sign of insecurity , a fear of being left alone , of being unloved . What the hell was he insecure about when he was eight ? she thought . Maybe I 'll start biting my nails tonight . She raised her cup and tasted the coffee . " It 's surprisinglygood , " she said , like a well-mannered guest at her host 's favorite restaurant . " After everything you hear about French coffee . " " When you visit a country , " Tony said , " you find that no one has ever told the truth about it . " He took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes gently , in what looked like an habitual , assuaging gesture . Without the glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed thoughtful and gentle and the air of restraint and austerity vanished from his face . " Do you still have to wear those dark glasses ? " Lucy asked . " Most of the time . " " The eyes are no better ? " " No . " " Have you tried doing anything about it ? " " Not for a long time , " Tony said , putting the glasses onp262again , giving Lucy the impression of a flat , impenetrable barrier being raised against her . " I tired of the medical fakes , " he said . Listening to his slow , unaccented deep voice , with its undertone of weariness and skepticism , Lucy remembered the rushed , shrill confusion of his speech when he was a boy . We saw a deer , she remembered , in the high adolescent tones . He came down to the lake to drink . . . " Tony , " Lucy said , impulsively , " what 's the matter ? What 's wrong with you ? " He looked surprised . He hesitated for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , " I see that Dora did n't waste her time . " " It is n't only Dora . Anybody can see in a minute that ... " " Nothing 's wrong with me , " Tony said harshly . He shook his head , irritated . Then he smiled and resumed the tone of formal good manners . " By the way , what did you think of her ? Dora . . . " She 's very pretty . " " Is n't she ? " Tony said pleasantly . " And very unhappy . " " That 's the way it goes , " he said , his voice flat . " And afraid . " " Who is n't afraid these days ? " Tony asked . Now he sounded flippant and impatient and Lucy had the feeling that he was on the verge of getting up from the table and fleeing . " She 's afraid you 're going to leave her , " Lucy went on stubbornly , hoping that perhaps by disturbing him , questioninghim , wounding him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the best thing in the world for her , " Tony said , smiling . " It 's not so serious . Everybody we know leaves everybody else we know all the time . "  | " Tony , " Lucy said hurriedly , moving away from that subject , " why do you live in Europe ? " Tony glanced at her , amusedly . " You 're so American , " he said . " Americans think it 's somehow immoral to live in Europe . " " It 's not that , " Lucy said , thinking of the shabby , characterless , uncomfortable apartment , so obviously furnished only for brief passages and people without roots . " It 's just that you 're not at home here . . . and your wife and child . " Tony nodded . " Exactly , " he said . " That 's the great thing about it . It takes away most of the feeling of responsibil-ity . " " How long is it since you 've been back home ? " Tony looked as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and half-closed his eyes , the sun glitteringon the dark glasses . " Eighteen years , " he said . Lucy felt herself flushing . " I do n't mean that , " she said . " I meant since you were back in the States . " " Five , six years , " he said carelessly , bringing his head forward again , and pushing his cup thoughtfully a little distance away from him on the table , like a man making a move on a chessboard . " Do you ever intend to go back ? " Tony shrugged . " Maybe , " he said . " Who knows ? " " Is it a question of money ? " Tony grinned . " Ah , " he said , " I see that you 've caught on that we 're not the richest young Americans in Europe . " " What happened to all the money you got when the will was settled and the business was sold ? " Lucy asked . Tony shrugged again . " The usual , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , easy go . I was n't particularly anxious to hold onto it . It made me uncomfortable . " He peered at her closely . " How aboutp264you ? " he asked . " Do you feel comfortable with it ? " His tone was not censorious , merely inquisitive . Lucy decided to ignore the question . " If you ever need any money . . . " she began . Tony waved , interrupting her . " Be careful , " he said , " this may be costly . " " I mean it . " " I 'll remember it , " he said gravely . " Dora says you 're not particularly happy with your work . . " Did she actually say that ? " Tony sounded surprised . " Not exactly , " Lucy admitted . " But she said you used another name and . . . " " I 'm not good enough to make it really worth while , " Tony said thoughtfully , seeming to be talking for himself rather than for her . " And , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointless , depressing grind . " " Why do n't you do something else ? " Lucy asked . " You sound like my wife . " Tony smiled . " It must be a general female optimism  --  that if you do n't like what you 're doing all you have to do is close up shop and start something else the next day . " " What happened to the medical school ? " Lucy asked . " I heard you were doing very well , until you quit . . . " " I dabbled among the corpses for two years , " Tony said . " I had a light touch with the dead and my professors thought highly of me . . . " I heard , " Lucy said . " I know a man from Columbia and he told me . Why did you stop ? " " Well , when the estate was settled it seemed foolish to be slaving fourteen hours a day with all that money in the bank , and suddenly the idea of travel seemed very attractive . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't interested in healing anybody . "  | " Tony . . . " Lucy said . Her voice sounded strained inside her head , and muffled . " Yes ? " " Are you really like this , Tony ? Or are you putting it on ? " Tony leaned back and watched two girls in black dresses crossing the street diagonally in front of them . " I do n't know , " he said . " I 'm waiting for someone to tell me . " " Tony , " Lucy said , " do you want me to get up from here and leave you alone ? " He did n't answer immediately . He took off his glasses slowly and put them on the table with great care . Then he looked at her soberly , his face exposed , not defending himself , the deep , familiar eyes sad , considering . " No , " he said finally , and he reached out and touched her hand gently . " I could n't bear it . " " Will you do something for me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . " Will you come with me to Normandy today ? I want to visit the town where your father was killed , and the cemeteryin which he 's buried . I have a letter from a man who was with him when it happened and I know the name of the town . . . It 's Ozieres . " " Ozieres , " Tony said , putting his glasses on again , restoringthe barrier , as though he was already regretting the moment of softness . " I 've passed through there . I saw no plaques . " He laughed sourly . " What a place to get killed in ! " " Did n't you know ? " Tony shook his head . " No . You sent me a telegram that he 'd been killed . That 's all . " " Did you ever hear how it happened ? " " No . " " He heard there were some Germans in the town whop266wanted to surrender , " Lucy said , " and he walked in under a white flag and five minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little old for things like that , " Tony said . " He wanted to get killed , " said Lucy . " Read the papers , " Tony said . " The world is full of people who want to get killed . " " Did n't you get that feeling from him when you saw him during the war ? " " I did n't see him much , " Tony said , staring past Lucy , obviously not wanting to talk about it . " And when I did see him the only feeling I got from him was embarrassment that I was n't in uniform . " " Tony ! " Lucy said . " That was n't true . " " No ? " He shrugged . " Perhaps not . Perhaps he was only embarrassed that I was alive . " " Do n't talk like that ! " " Why not ? " Tony said harshly . " I made up my mind a long time ago I was n't going to lie about the way we felt about each other , my father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Under a white flag , " Tony said , as though he had n't heard her . " I suppose there 're worse ways for fathers to die . Tell me something . . . " Yes . " " Did you really just see me by accident at that bar last night , or did you come to Paris knowing you were going to look for me ? " He was watching her quizzically , his face ready to disbelieve her . " I did n't even know you were in Europe , " she said . " And when you went out and I asked the man if he knew where you lived , I think I was hoping he would n't know and I would n't be able to find out . " Tony nodded . " Yes , " he said , " I can understand that . " " I knew that , one day , we would have to meet somewhere , " Lucy said.  | " I suppose so , " Tony said . " I suppose if you have a son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have arranged it differently , " Lucy said rememberingher fantasies , the deathbed , the kiss , " if I was arranging it . " " Still , " said Tony , " this will have to do . So now you want to visit the grave . . . Well , that 's natural enough . I do n't say we should do it , but it 's natural enough . Tell me , " he said conversationally , " did you notice how vulgar he becametoward the end ? " " No , " Lucy said . " Of the dead only good . " Tony smiled harshly . " Of course . Loud and empty , full of officers ' club jokes and patriotriceditorials and speculation about chorus girls .. He was always asking me if I had enough money to have a good time . He winked when he said it . I always told him I could use an extra hundred . " " He was a generous man , " Lucy said . " Maybe that was what was wrong with him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and blue , burning out whitely toward the south . " It 's a good day for a trip to the country . I have a date for lunch , but I guess I can explain about dead fathers and returned mothers and things like that . I 'll explain I have to travel to a battlefield , under a white flag . " " Do n't , " Lucy said thickly , standing up . " Do n't come with me if you feel like that . " " Tell me , " Tony said , without moving , still staring up at the hot sky , " why do you want to do this ? " Lucy held onto the table to steady herself . She felt exhausted . She looked down at the tight , back-thrown face of her son , with the dark glasses casting a sharp , smoky shadow on the taut skin of his cheekbones . " Because we destroyed him , " she said dully . " You and I. Because we must not forget him . " **26;9569;TOOLONG at the Baltimore courthouse early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ #8 and declared that if no one present could offer evidence of such sympathies as were therein interdicted , he was prepared to declare the matter settled and to order the will executed at once . Froebel then appeared , much to my surprise , and announced that he had such evidence , enough to warrant the reversal of bequests provided for by our will , and was ready to offer it to the court . " You told me there was n't anything , " I reminded Harrison , who had turned white . " I swear there is n't ! " he whispered back , but nevertheless he began perspiring and trembling a little . I sat back to see what Froebel had cooked up . " What will you attempt to prove ? " the Judge asked him . " That as recently as last year , Your Honor , while his poor father was in the grave  --  perhaps speeded there ( who knows ? ) by his son 's regrettable irresponsibility  --  that just last year , Your Honor , this son , who is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers , was aiding and abetting actively , with large gifts of money , that infamous communist doctrine against which his father 's entire life was such an eloquent argument ; confident , I doubt not , that he could conceal his surreptitious Bolshevism until such time as he was in a position to devote the whole of the Mack estate towards overthrowing the way of life that made its accumulationpossible ! " Froebel  --  need I point out ?  --  was a past master of the detachednoun clause : judge and spectators were stirred . " For heaven 's sake ! " Harrison whispered . " You do n't think he means my Spanish donations ! " " If you were silly enough to make any , then I daresay he does , " I replied , appalled anew at Harrison 's innocence . And indeed , the " Spanish donations " were precisely what Froebel had in mind . He offered in evidence photostated checks , four of them , for one thousand dollars each , madep101out to an American subscription agency representing theSpanish Loyalist government . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and October 7 , and all were signed Harrison A. Mack , Jr . Judge Lasker examined the photostats and frowned . " Did you write these checks ? " he asked Harrison , passing the picturesto him . " Of course ! " Harrison yelled . " What the hell 's that  --  " " Order ! " suggested the Judge . " Are n't you aware that the Loyalist movement is run by the Communist Party ? Directedfrom the Kremlin ? " " Aw , come on ! " Harrison pleaded , until I poked him and he sat down . " May I point out , " Froebel continued blandly , " that not only is a gift to the Loyalists in essence a gift to Moscow , but this particular subscription agency is a notorious Party organization , under F.B.I . surveillance . A man may donate tothe Loyalists through honest , if vague , liberalism , I daresay ; but one does n't send checks to this subscription outfit unless one is sympathetic , to say the least , with the Comintern . Young Mr. Mack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I fear , a blue-blood with a Red heart . " I believe it was this final metaphor that won Froebel the judgment . It was too good to let pass . I saw the newspaper people virtually doff their unpleasant hats in tribute , and scribble the immortal words for the next editions of their papers . Even the Judge smiled benignly upon the happy trope : I could see that it struck him square in the prejudices , and found a welcome there . There was some further discussion , but no one listened closely ; everyone was repeating to himself , with a self-satisfiedsmile , that all young aristocrats are blue-bloods with Red hearts . Blue-bloods with Red hearts ! How could mere justice cope with poetry ? Men , I think , are ever attracted to the bon mot rather than the mot juste , and judges , no lessp102than other men , are often moved by considerations more aesthetic than judicial . Even I was not a little impressed , and regretted only that we had no jury to be overwhelmed by such a purple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Red heart ! How brandish mere reasonableness against pure music ? Should I hope to tip the scales with puny logic , when Froebel had Parnassus in his pan ? In vain might I warn Judge Lasker that , through the press , all America was watching , and Europe as well , for his decision . " My client , a lover of freedom and human dignity , " I declared , " made his contributions to the oppressed Loyalists as a moral obligation , proper to every good American , to fight those Rebels who would crush the independence of the human spirit , and trample liberty under hobnailed boots ! How can you charge him with advocating anarchy and violentoverthrow , when in a single year he gives four thousand dollars to support the Spanish government against those who would overthrow it ? " And on I went for some minutes , talking like a congressionalcandidate , trying to make capital out of the Spanish confusion , wherein the radicals were the status quo and the reactionaries the rebels . It was , I must say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my cause was lost . Only Froebel , I think , had ears for my rhetoric ; the rest of the room was filled with blue-bloods with Red hearts . And Judge Lasker , as I mentioned before in another connection , was a famous conservative . Though by no means a fascist himself  --  he was probably uncommitted in the Spanish revolution  --  he epitomized the unthinking antagonism of his class toward anything pinker than the blue end of the spectrum : a familiar antagonism that used to infuriate me when , prior to 1924 , I was interested in such things as social justice . When finally he ruled , he ruled in Froebel 's favor . " It does not matter whether there is a difference between the Moscow and Madrid varieties of communism , " he de/Glared , " or whether the Court or anyone else approves or disapproves of the defendant 's gifts or the cause for which they were intended . The fact is that the subscription agency involved is a communist organization under government surveillance , and a gift to that agency is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the donor 's sympathy with what the agency represented , and what it represented was communism . The will before me provides that should such sympathybe demonstrated , as it has been here , the terms of the document are to be reversed . The Court here orders such a reversal . " Well , we were poor again . Harrison went weak , and when I offered him a cigar he came near to vomiting . " It 's incredible ! " he croaked , actually perspiring from the shock of it . " Do you give up ? " I asked him . " Or shall I appeal ? " He clutched at the hope eagerly . " Can we appeal ? " " Sure , " I said . " Do n't you see how unlogical Lasker'sreasoning is ? " " Unlogical ! It was so logical it overwhelmed me ! " " Not at all , " I assured him . " He said the subscription agency was sympathetic to communism . You give money to the agency ; therefore you 're sympathetic to communism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Salvation Army girl who happens to be a vegetarian , you 're sympathetic to vegetarians . The communists support the Loyalists ; you support the Loyalists ; therefore you 're a communist . " Harrison was tremendously relieved , but so weak he could scarcely stand . He laughed shortly , nervously . " Well ! That puts us back in the race , does n't it ? Ha , I 'd thought there for a while  --  Christ , Toddy , you 've saved my ass again ! Damned judge ! We 've got it now , boy ! " I shook my head , and he went white again . " What the hell 's wrong ? " " I 'll appeal , " I said , " but we 'll lose again , I guess . "  | " How 's that ? Lose again ! " He laughed , and sucked in his breath . " Forget about the logic , " I said . " Nobody really cares about the logic . They make up their minds by their prejudicesabout Spain . I think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd have to talk Lasker into liberalism to win the case . " I went on to explain that of the seven judges of the Court of Appeals who would review the decision , three were Republicanswith a pronounced antiliberal bias , two were fairly liberal Democrats , one was a reactionary " Southern Democrat , " more antiliberal than the Republicans , and the seventh , an unenthusiastic Democrat , was relatively unbiased . " I know them all , " I said . " Abrams , Moore , and Stevens , the Republicans , will vote against you . Forrester , the SouthernDemocrat , would vote for you if it were a party issue , but it 's not ; he 'll go along with the Republicans . Stedman and Barnes , the liberals , will go along with you , and I think Haddawaywill too , because he likes me and because he dislikes Lasker 's bad logic . " " But hell , that 's four to three ! " Harrison cried . " That means I lose ! " " As I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's too much to predict , " I said . " I do n't know that they 've declared themselves on Spain , and I do n't know them personally . But they 've affirmed almost every important verdictof the Court of Appeals in three years . " Harrison was crushed . " It 's unjust ! " was all he could say . " You know how these things are , " I smiled . " Aw , but what the hell ! " He shook his head , tapped his feet impatiently , pursed his lips , sighed in spasms . I expected him to faint , but he held on tightly , though he could scarcely talk . The truth was , of course , that it is one thing  --  an easy thing  --  to give what Cardinal Newman calls " no/tional " assent to a proposition such as " There is no justice " ; quite another and more difficult matter to give it " real " assent , to learn it stingingly , to the heart , through involvement . I remember hoping that Harrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive loss . I appealed the judgment of the Court . " Just to leave the door open , " I explained . " I might think of something . " That evening , before I left Baltimore with Harrison , we had dinner at Bill Froebel 's club , as his guests . I praised his inspiration , and he my logic-twisting . Harrison was morose , and although he drank heavily , he refused to join in the conversation . He could n't drive home . On the way , he would clutch my arm and groan , " Three million bucks , Toddy ! " I looked coldly at him . " Hell , man , " he protested , " I know what you 're thinking , but you should know me better . I do n't want the money like another man might , just to go crazy on . Think what we could do on three million bucks , the three of us ! " It was the first time since Jane and I had resumed our affair in 1935 that Harrison had spoken again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had used to do . " A million apiece ? " I asked . " Or a joint account ? " Harrison felt the bristles and flinched , and all the way home he felt constrained to pretend that the loss of three million dollars touched his philosophical heart not at all . I watched the effort from the corner of my eye , and marveled sadly at his disorientation . Finally he broke down , as we were crossing the Choptank River bridge , pulling into Cambridge . The water was whitecappedand cold-looking . Dead ahead , at the end of the boulevard that the bridge ran onto , Morton 's Marvelous Tomatoes , Inc. , spread its red neon banner across the sky , and I smiled . The town lights ran in a flat string along the water 's edge , from Hambrooks Bar Lighthouse , flashing onp106the right , to the Macks ' house in East Cambridge , its groundfloorwindows still lit , where Jane was waiting . " I give up , Toddy , " he said tersely ; " I 'm no philosopher . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one time without the money  --  I did get myself disinherited a few times , you know . But once it came so close and seemed so sure  --  " " What is it ? " I snapped . " Ah , Christ  --  Janie and I had plans , boy . " He choked on his plans . " How the hell can I say it ? I just do n't feel like living any more . " " You what ? " I sneered . " What 'll you do  --  hang yourself in the cellar ? There 's a handy twenty-penny nail right there , in a joist  --  you 'll find it . It 's already been broken in . And I know an undertaker who can turn black faces white again . " " All right , all right , " Harrison said . " I do n't care what you think . I said I 'm no philosopher . " " Forget about philosophy , " I said . " You do n't lack philosophy , buddy ; you lack guts . I suppose you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the two of us can remember you ? You 're wallowing , Harrison . Cut it out  --  it 's swinish . " " I 'm weak , Toddy , " he said . " I ca n't help it . Do n't think I 'm not ashamed of it , man . " " Then cut it out , " I suggested curtly . " Do n't give me any of this psychic determinism crap . Just cut it out . " " You ca n't just cut it out , " Harrison protested , and I sensed that he was growing stronger . " I 'm past believing that people can change . " " You do n't want to cut it out , " I said . " Sure I do . It does n't matter whether I do or not ; I ca n't do it . I 'm weak in some ways , Toddy . You do n't understand that . " I flicked my cigarette out of the ventilator in a shower of sparks . We were off the bridge then , coasting along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know what weakness is . But you make your own diffii/culties , Harrison . It 's hard because you never thought of it as easy . Listen . An act of will is the easiest thing there is  --  so easy it 's laughable how people make mountains of it . " Harrison had by this time actually subjugated the idea of his loss and was following the thought . " You know better , " he said . " You ca n't discount psy-chology . " " I 'm not saying anything about psychology , " I maintained . " Psychology does n't interest me . What I 'm saying is that the free-will/determinism business is irrelevant to us , because if we 're predetermined , we ca n't know in which direction . We act as if we could choose , and so we can , in effect . All you have to do to be strong in this is stop being weak . " " Impossible . " " You never tried it . " Nor , alas , did he want to just then : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house for a last drink . Jane had heard the news , of course , by telephone , and she cried awhile . I told her flatly that I had no sympathy for either of them while they behaved like that . " What would you do , damn it ! " she cried impatiently . I laughed . " I 've never lost three million bucks , " I said , " but I 'll tell you what I did once , after Dad hanged himself for losing a few thousand . " I told them then , for the first time , the story of my adventureswith Col. Henry Morton  --  which story ; reader , I 'll pause to tell you , too , sooner or later , but not just now . I had decided that I did n't want Harrison to brood over his money : he was n't ready to be strong of his own choosing yet , apparently , and so I opened the way towards turning him into a cynic , in emulation of me . He was ripe for it anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story might do the trick . There 's little need for weakness , reader : you are freer , perhaps , than you 'd be comfortable knowing.  |p108As  I left , Jane asked me : " You do n't have anything up your sleeve , Toddy ? " " I sha n't commit myself , " I said . " But Harrison might as well believe he 's out three million bucks , at least for a while . " " What will he do ? " she asked anxiously . " Did he say anything to you coming home ? " " He 'll either grow stronger or hang himself , " I predicted . " If he grows stronger it wo n't matter to him whether he gets the money or not , really , and then I would n't mind seeing him get it . If he kills himself over it , I 'll be just as glad he 's dead , frankly . Sissies make me uncomfortable . That goes for you , too . You 're not ready for three million bucks yet . You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I ever lost three million dollars I 'd holler like a stuck hero . Or perhaps not : one really ca n't tell until the thing is upon one . Well , the will case dropped out of the papers then ; the Court of Appeals would n't hear the appeal for at least six months , though for reasons of my own I doubted that they 'd wait much longer than that . In the meantime , Lizzie Mack , Harrison 's mother , could n't use up the old man 's estate ( except for running expenses for the house ) , though it was temporarily hers . I conducted , during the next few months , a rather intensiveinvestigation into the characters of the appellate court judges  --  my findings , as I 'd anticipated , only confirmed my original estimate of the situation . As far as one with much information could guess , the decision would be four to three for Lizzie if the hearing were held when tentatively scheduled . And if it were n't ? I considered that question , sitting in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What advantage was there in delay , if any ? And how could one delay the appeal ? The advantage was negative : that is , I was certain of defeat if there were no delay ; if there were any , Ip109might very possibly still be defeated , but there would be more time for something to turn up . So , I suppose , a condemned man snatches at a day 's reprieve , still hoping for a god on wires to fetch him off , and on the very gibbet , his neck roped , pleads eye-to-sky for the saving car . Who knows ? Perhaps , hooded and dropped , he yet waits in a second 's agony for God 's hands on him , till the noose cracks neck and hope in one sick snap . To be sure , ours was but a matter of money , but the principle was the same . By September the Loyalists might be winning , or it might become dangerous over here to like the Fascists , the way Hitler was behaving . By October Franco might win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they were no longer a threat to anything . Anythingcould happen to swing one more vote our way . Novemberwas an off-year election month : perhaps some party issue would ally John Forrester , the reactionary Democrat , with his more liberal colleagues . PerhapsI smiled , moved my feet off the desk , and went to the file . I looked up each of the judges , checking the length of their incumbencies and the number of years in office remaining to each . " Ah , Freddie Barnes , you old whoremonger , " I cooed ; " so you 're up to the post again this year , are you ? " That fact mattered little , since Roosevelt was going great guns and Barnes was a popular figure in Maryland : he 'd be re-elected without difficulty . Of the other Democrats , Forresterhad two years to go , Haddaway had four , and Stedman had six . I checked the Republicans : Abrams had two years yet ; Stevens , six ; Moore " Well , well , well ! " I grinned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh ? " Mrs. Lake , at my request , spent the rest of her afternoon telephoning various Baltimorians for me , some eminent and some shady , some honest and some flexible , some friendly and some employable . By quitting time I was one of perhapsp110seven people , other than God , who knew as a fact , beyond puny speculation , that Judge Rollo Moore , despite the backingof Maryland Republicanism , was going to lose his coming election by a well-insured margin to Joseph Singer , who , bless his heart , was a chronic if somewhat fuzzy liberal  --  a man after Harrison 's own heart . We would win , by God , almost certainly , if we could hold off the appeal until November ! No , until January of 1938 , after the new officeholders had been sworn in . Nearly a year ! I racked my brain , in my thorough but unenthusiastic way , to think of some stalling maneuver , but of the few I could imagine , none was satisfactory . What I needed was somethingdiverting , something tenuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if need be . Nothing crude would do : my maneuver , whatever it was , must be subtle even if its motives were clear to the professional eye , or else I should lose the respect , and possibly the vote , of men like Judge Haddaway , for instance , whose decisions were more often influenced by such things as the symmetry and logical elegance of a brief than by more mundane considerations like the appellant 's politics . Ah , nonsense , there was nothing . The months passed ; it was spring ; August and judgment would soon be upon us . Harrison sweated but kept silent . Jane wept a little , and sometimes failed to come to my room when I expected her , but kept silent . They were learning ; they were strengthening , or else they were naive enough to have some canine faith in me . At least they kept silent about it , though I often caught them looking at me intently , at supper or wherever . In fact , they often stared at me , and sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , I stared at my wall . I have in my office , opposite the desk , a fine staring-wall , a wall that I keep scrupulously clear for staring purposes , and I stared at it . I stared at it through February , March , April , and May , and through thep111first week of June , without reading on its empty surface a single idea . Then , on the very hot June 17th of 1937 , our Mrs. Lake , who is as a rule a model of decorum , came sweating decorouslyinto my office with a paper cup of iced coffee for me , set it decorously on my desk , accepted my thanks , dropped a handkerchief on the floor as she turned to leave , bent decorously down to retrieve it , and most undaintily  --  oh , most indecorously  --  broke wind , virtually in my coffee . " Oh , excuse me ! " she gasped , and blushed , and fled . But ah , the fart hung heavy in the humid air , long past the lady 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; it miscegenated with the smoke of my cigar , caressed the beading oil on the skin of my nose , lay obscenely on the flat of my desk , among my briefs and papers . It was everywhere , but I had learned , even then , to live with nature and my fellow animals . I did n't flinch ; I did n't move . Through its dense invisible presence I regarded my oracular wall , and this time fruitfully . " By God , now ! " I cried . I heard a small sound in the outer office . " Mrs. Lake ! " I rushed to my door . " Where 's all the crap ? " " Oh , Mr. Andrews ! " she wailed , and buried her face in her arms , weeping . Harry Bishop and Jimmy Andrews peered skeptically from their doorways . " No ! " I said , patting Mrs. Lake furiously on the head . " No , I mean old man Mack 's pickle jars . Where 've they been all this time ? Where does Lizzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Lake sniffed , wiping her eyes bravely . " What was it ? " I hurried back to my file , began pushing things around , and finally found the inventory of the Mack estate . " One hundred twenty-nine bottles of it , in the wine cellar ! " " Well , " remarked Mr. Bishop , and returned to his work . Jimmy Andrews hung around to see what was up . " Call ' Stacia , " I said to Mrs. Lake . " No , hell no , don't.  |p112I  'll run up to Baltimore . " I looked at my watch . " Will you run me to the bus , Jim ? I bet I can catch the four o'clock . " " Sure , " Jimmy said . He drove insanely ; I made the bus with two minutes to spare , and was soon off to Baltimore . Eustacia Callader was an old Negro servant in the Mack household , whom I 'd met during the course of the litigation . She had virtually raised Harrison Junior and was quietly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she grasped little of the controversy . She it was whom I sought now . Arriving in Baltimore four hours later , I stopped in a drugstoreto buy envelopes and stamps , and then took a taxi out to Ruxton , getting out at the driveway of the Mack house . The sun had just set , and I actually hid myself on the grounds in the rear of the house  --  it was all quite theatrical  --  and waited , I suppose , for ' Stacia to come out of the kitchen for something . An unlikely plan , I 'll confess , but then my whole scheme , my suspicion , was unlikely : when the great Negro woman did , as a matter of fact , waddle out just forty-five minutes later , en route to the garbage cans down by the big garage , I took her appearance as a good omen . Following her out of earshot of the house , I approached her . " Lord ' a mercy , Mister Andrews ! " she giggled enormously . " What y'all doin ' up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listen , kid , " I whispered urgently . " I 've got a five-buck question . " I gave her the five , and she giggled helplessly : all Negroes consider me insane . " Where does Lizzie keep the old man 's fertilizer ? " I asked . " Is it still in the wine cellar ? " " De fertilize ' ? " ' Stacia chortled . " What fertilize ' ? " She laughed so hard that I knew she did n't understand . " The crap , ' Stacia , " I demanded . " How does Lizzie feel about all those bottles of crap ? " " Oh , " ' Stacia wheezed . " Dat 's what you mean de ferti-lize ' ! "  | " A hundred and twenty-nine jars of it , " I said . " Used to be in the wine cellar . Are they still there ? " When ' Stacia regained control of her risibility , she admitted that she did n't know , but she promised to find out and tell me . I gave her an impassioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge clump of forsythia bushes near the garbage cans , while ' Stacia returned to the house to question the other servants who lived in . I was prepared , if it should prove necessary , to bribe somebody heavily to destroythose pickle jars for me secretly , but I did n't look forward to taking that step , since it opened the way for blackmail . Still , it seemed highly unlikely to me that Mrs. Mack had ordered them removed herself , although it was exactly that possibility which had occurred to me on the occasion of Mrs. Lake 's faux pas . I was pleasantly surprised , then , when three hours later  --  it was after midnight  --  ' Stacia lumbered back with the announcement that though the bottles were indeed still in the wine cellar , Mrs. Mack had observed last week to R. J. Collier , the gimpy , dusty old fellow who tended the gardens , that the seals on the jars were apparently not airtight , and had mentioned the possibility of someday disposing of the collection . Indeed , ' Stacia verified that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell noticeably , and that the odor was creeping up occasionally to the ground floor . Two days before , R. J. Collier had taken it upon himself to pile the whole stack into the far corner of the wine cellar and to cover it with a wet tarpaulin , hoping thereby to check the bouquet , but his experiment had yielded no apparent results . Mrs. Mack was growing annoyed . R. J. Collier had , that very day , broached the suggestion that his late employer'ssingular remains be put to work around the flower gardens  --  the zinnia beds , especially , could use the nourishment , he declared . All the servants considered the suggestion more touching than tactless , and I , too , sensed a seed ofp114poetry in the gardener 's practicality . But Lizzie had remained noncommittal . " Listen , ' Stacia , " I said , " you must n't say a word about the pickle jars , or about me being here . I 'm going to give you ten dollars , honey  --  " " Hoo , Mr. Andrews ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I want you to keep a close watch on those jars . Make sure you know everything that Liz or R. J. Collier or anybody else does to them . Look , I 'm giving you all these envelopes with stamps on them . They 're addressed to me , so keep them hidden , and there 's paper inside . Now , then , every time even one of those bottles is moved from where it is now , you write to me and tell me . Under-stand ? " ' Stacia giggled and shook and grunted , but I was fairly sure she understood . " For Christ 's sake do n't say a word , " I cautioned her again . " If everything turns out right , Harrison will give you a brandnewcar . A yellow roadster , he 'll buy you . Okay ? " ' Stacia could scarcely stand for laughing . But she stuck the envelopes deep between her endless bosoms and rumbled off to the house , shaking her head indulgently at my derangement . I walked out to the road and hiked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in my office , smoking cigars and staring at my wall . I did n't bother to tell Harrison anything about my trip  --  perhaps nothing would come of it after all . And except for the infrequent parries with Charley Parks , the attorney next door , over our automobile suit  --  you 'll recallI mentioned it earlier ?  --  I had done nothing else , no work at all on any case , since then : nearly a week . I was waiting for ' Stacia 's letter , and thinking steadily about possible alternativeplans of action . I 'd decided to sit thus until July 1 . If nothing had happened to the jars by then , I 'd take the risk of bribing R. J. Collier to destroy some of them.  |p115Then  , this morning , there was ' Stacia 's letter , one of the self-addressed envelopes I 'd given her . It could contain anythingfrom nonsense to the key to three million dollars , and it was merely as a disciplinary exercise that I 'd postponed reading it until after I 'd read the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I sha n't exact such discipline from you , reader . Here is the letter : Mr. Andrew . Mrs. Mack , has put pickle jars in grenhouse . R. J. Coler , has put on zinas . Eustacia M. Callader . R. J. Coler , has put 72 bottles on zinas . Eustacia M. Callader . I put the letter in the dossier with the other documents pertaining to the Mack will case , returned the dossier to the file , and locked the filing cabinets . For nearly two hours I stared at my wall , and then I left the office to stroll uptown for my appointment with Marvin . A good morning 's work , reader : I opened a few letters and put one in the file . An excellent morning 's work for one 's last morning on earth , I should say . My friend Harrison is three million dollars richer for it.  |p116The  thermometer outside the offices of The Daily Banner read eighty-nine degrees when I walked past it on my way uptown . Few people were on the streets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sleek black hearse was parked , its loading door closed , and several mourners , along with the black-suited employees of the establishment , stood quietly about in the yard . As I approached , a fat black pussycat , scarred with experience and heavy with imminent kittens , trotted wearily out of a hydrangea bush beside the undertaker'sporch into the sun , and for no discernible reason curled plumply in the middle of the sidewalk and closed her eyes . Just then the door opened , and the pallbearers came out bringing the casket . Their path was diverted , but not greatly , by the pregnant cat . Some of the pallbearers smiled , and an employee of the funeral home nudged the cat aside with his toe . She got up , stretched , yawned , and padded off to find some less-traveled thoroughfare to sleep in ; the loadingdoor of the hearse was swung open , and the casket loaded gently inside.  |p117I  smiled and walked on . Nature , coincidence , can often be a heavy-handed symbolizer . She seems at times fairly to club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " **25;9597;TOOLONG " scenario , so obvious even in its details that it was embarrasing . One is constantly being confronted with a sun that bursts from behind the clouds just as the home team takes the ball ; ominous rumblings of thunderwhen one is brooding desultorily at home ; magnificent sunrises on days when one has resolved to mend one 's ways ; hurricanes that demolish a bad man 's house and leave his good neighbor 's untouched , or vice-versa ; Race Streets marked slow ; Cemetery Avenues marked ONE WAY . The man whose perceptions are not so rudimentary , whose palate is attuned to subtler dishes , can only smile uncomfortably and walk away , reminding himself , if he is wise , that good taste is , after all , only a human invention . But it 's not easy to keep one 's patience in the face of the world 's abundant ingenuousness . For instance , when I came to the corner of High and Poplar Streets and stopped to chat awhile with Capt . Osborn and two of his idle cronies , installedon their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I had to put up with a prominent MEN WORKING sign near an open manhole in the street before them ; a senile clock in the store window , which , like the store and the old men , had ceased to mark the passage of time ; a movie-theater poster directly behind Capt . Osborn 's head , advertising a double bill  --  Life Begins at Forty and Captains Courageous ; a pigeon perched recklessly on a NO PARKING sign  --  I could go on for a page . Really , to resist the temptation to use such ponderous , ready-made symbols taxes one 's very integrity , and I 'm certain that if I were writing stories for my bread and butter , my resistance would weaken . I recall once reading a story that ended with the hero dead on the floor  --  was he a suicide or a homicide ?  --  beneath a cash register announcing : THIS REGISTERS THE AMOUNT OF YOUR PURCHASE . The ma/chine , as one familiar with life 's elephantine ironies might have anticipated , registered zero , and I for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of acumen that he could n't ignore that cash register , or make it read $4.37 or some other meaninglessfigure . It 's too easy otherwise , like using cliches . So , reader , should you ever find yourself writing about the world , take care not to nibble at the many tempting symbols she sets squarely in your path , or you 'll be baited into saying things you do n't really mean , and offending the people you want most to entertain . Develop , if you can , the technique of the pallbearers and myself : smile , to be sure , but walk on and say nothing , as though you had n't noticed.  |p119Socially  , as well as economically , Capt . Osborn and his colleagues of the loafer 's bench were exclusively consumers . They ate food , wore clothing , and smoked cigars , but they produced nothing . They sat immobile on their antique bench like a row of crusty oysters and ingested with their eyes everythingthat passed , but they did not participate . They were out of it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cambridgepassed by and through them like sea water through an oyster 's gills : they strained from it what nutrition they wanted as it passed , digesting people and events with a snort or a comment , but they never moved from their position . They were a chorus of ancient oysters , stolidy regarding the fish that swam through their ken . Their infrequent voices were slow , nasal , high-pitched , and senile . A bright blue roadster , for example , would roar by . " Eee , there rides young Mowb Henly ! " one would observe . " ' E 's a hot one , " another would add . " Ol ' Mowb 's boy . Ca n't do nothin ' with that youngster . " " No , sir , " a third would agree . " Eee , of Mowb 's boy ! " the first would repeat , rumbling his way up to a wet cackle of mirth and expectoration.  | " ' E 's bad as ' is ol ' man , " the second would remark . " Ye know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Like father , like son . " The first would choke and strangle then , his red rheumy eyes a-twinkle , his red cracked face all grinning , the small saliva spilling over his brown teeth and thin red lips , and begin the refrain again : ' Tee ! Hmph ! Hawk ! Sploo ! Ol '  --  thoo ! Thff ! OF  --  Hawk ! Thff ! Thoo ! Ol ' Mowb Henly ! Thooie ! " I had a few minutes to spare , so I took a seat at the shady end of the bench  --  the old men liked the sun  --  and listened to their hoary music for a while . Presently the loaded hearse drove by from the funeral parlor , two cars with lighted headlightsfollowing behind . The procession paused at the intersectionand then moved on through the red light , heading for Greenlawn Cemetery , out toward the country club . " Whose funeral ? " I asked . " Why , that 's Clarence Wampler 's wife , ai n't it , Osborn ? " offered my neighbor , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capt . Osborn . " Died Monday night . " " That the Henry Street one , come from Golden Hill ? " asked the third . " Naw , that 's Lewis Wampler 's wife yer thinkin ' of , " Capt . Osborn declared . " Yer thinkin ' of ol ' Jenny Fairwell . " " Ol ' Jenny ? " the first cackled . " ol ' Jenny ? " " Ol ' Jenny , " Capt . Osborn grinned , stretching his leg . " There was a hot one . " " 01 ' Jenny ! " the first snuffled happily . " This here 's Clarence Wampler 's wife , " Capt . Osborn explained . " Lived on Ross Street , down by the creek . " " Sure , " the first said . " I b'lieve she was a Canlon , were n't she ? " " Now let 's see , " Capt . Osborn mused . " She was the oldest Canlon girl  --  must of been Louise Mae. "  | " Louise Mae Canlon . Hell , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Louise Mae Canlon , " Capt . Osborn repeated . " She was the oldest  --  ol ' Cap'n Will Canlon 's girls , down to Golden Hill . Louise Mae Canlon must of been twenty when ClarenceWampler married ' er . I remember that was the year ol ' Cap'n Canlon lost ' is schooner in the ice  --  I was just startin ' out with my own boat that season , the June Phillips , I bought ' er off of man George Phillips , down to Fishin ' Creek . That 'd be ' bout 1885 , I s'pect . " " Cap'n Canlon 's schooner ? " asked the third old fellow , who had remained silent . " Ye mean the Samuel T. Brice ? " " Naw , that was ' is ol ' boat , " Capt . Osborn declared . " I b'lieve the Samuel T. Brice burned up one time , tied up to Long Dock in Baltimore . This was Cap'n Will 's new boat  --  what was ' er name ? LaVerne Canlon ? Yep , that 's it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , Cap'n Will had n't no more'n put ' er in the water , spankin ' new , ever ' line and whipstitch , ' fore we had that big freeze-up in the Bay , and be durned if ' e did n't git froze up in ' er , and the ice wrecked ' er . Were n't no icebreakers them days . " " No , sir , " the others agreed . " I durned near lost the June Phillips that winter , out off Sharp 's Island . Durned water was icin ' up so fast ye could watch it skim over , ever ' time the wind let off . Then the breeze would puff up and we 'd go a-scrunchin ' a little farther . I had a extra-heavy chain for a bobstay , thank the Lord ; I 'd told Walter Jones to hang a big one on ' er when ' e was fittin ' ' er out , and I mean I did n't know which would win , us or the ice . Thank the good Lord that breeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't no bobstay in the world would of cut that ice , I 'm tellin ' ye . " " Eee ! " chuckled the first . " Do n't freeze up no more like that ! " " Ol ' Cap'n Jamie Snyder  --  you remember Cap'n Jamie ?  |p122Ca|p'n  Jamie Snyder says to me , ' e saw Walter Jones a-hangin ' that big chain bobstay on the June Phillips , up in ' is yard , ' e says to me , Osborn , ' ' e says , yer goin ' to need six darkies in yer dinghy , ' ' e says , jest to keep ' er sailin ' trim ! ' Well , sir , I says to Cap'n Jamie , Cap'n Jamie , it looks like ice to me , this winter , ' I says , and I 'd a sight rather ship six darkies in my dinghy , than have to git out and walk home ! ' " " Eee ! " " Yes , sir ! " " Well , sir , I did n't think no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then come that big ice , and the June Phillips come a-scrunchin ' home from Sharp 's Island  --  took us till past dark  --  with that big bobstay jest a-chewin ' that ice like a lean hog chews corncobs , and a good load o ' oysters piled in the bow to give ' er weight . Next day I seen Cap'n Jamie down to the creek , lookin ' where the ice had ground the paint off the June Phillips 's cutwater , all round that chain , and a-shakin ' ' is head .

Then be durned if ' e did n't laugh it off and buy me a drink . That was of Cap'n Jamie fer ye ! " " 01 ' Cap'n Jamie ! " " Eee ! Thoo ! " Poor Louise Mae Canlon Wampler : the oysters would , perhaps , sing of her another day . I rose to leave  --  it was eleven-fifteen  --  and smiled all the way up Poplar St. , en route to Marvin Rose 's office . I felt very good about Capt . Osborn , and very happy that I was not going to live to be an old man , because the old man I 'd wantp123to be , I think , would be much like him , half archetype and half stereotype , and I am too self-conscious and inconsistent ( and for better or worse , too sophisticated ) to play the grand old man with comfort  --  though knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part anyway , comfortableor not . I 'll have to end this chapter by mentioning , reluctantly , that one can see one 's reflection sharply in the tile front of a jewelry store on Poplar St. , across from the poolroom , and that as a matter of historical fact I paused for a moment there to adjust the knot in my necktie , which I 'd loosened a bit during my morning 's work . What is embarrassing about this mirror  --  for the tile reflects like a dark mirror  --  is its convenience , not only on the street but in my narrative : the next story I have to tell you is a mirror-story , the story of what happened in my bedroom on my seventeenth birthday , and it 's unfortunate , considering what I said a few pages ago about life 's naive symbolisms , that I must employ such a too-perfect , Hollywoodish bridge to reach that story , but there 's no help for it . And I lose even by so explaining my discomfiture concerningthese juxtaposed mirrors  --  the one on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explanation itself is arch , painfully so , and my pointing out its archness archer still , until , like any image caught between facing mirrors , this conclusion loses itself , like a surrealist colonnade , in an infiniteregress of archness . I apologize.  |p124My  mother having died when I was only seven years old , I grew up under the inconsistent tutelage of my father and a succession of maids and housekeepers . My father always expressedgreat concern over my welfare and proper guidance , but from either necessity or disinclination he seldom gave me a great deal of personal attention . As for the maids and housekeepers , some liked me and some did n't , but all had their own affairs to mind while Dad was working , and so I was left to myself much of the time . Let me say at once , though , that I was almost never an ill-behaved child . Not at all . I was quiet , but not uncommunicative ; reserved , but not reclusive ; energetic at times , but seldom enthusiastic . There were few restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ( and am ) temperamentallydisposed to observing rules  --  my desires seldom fell without their pale . And because I so rarely gave him cause for concern , my father was notably incurious about my activities . Therefore , when I really wanted to do something of which I was certain he would n't approve , it was not difficult for me to do it.  |p125My  sex life , reader , up to my seventeenth year , was so unspectacularas to be unworthy of mention . I did all the things that young anthropoids delight in while growing up ; my highschoolamours were limited to hot , open-mouthed kisses and much risque conversation  --  until my alliance with Miss Betty June Gunter . Betty June , at age seventeen , was a thin , almost scrawny little thing , most ungainly and sharp in the face , with good eyes , crooked teeth , coarse blond hair , fine skin , and no hips or breasts to speak of . She was not considered unattractive in my set , though socially she was certainly of an inferior caste . Betty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirited girl , and there was a sharpness in her speech that bespoke a mind livelier than those of a number of more scholarly girls in our class . Besides  --  and this was her chief attraction  --  Betty June was sophisticated , worldly , informed , in a way that none of the thoroughly respectable girls of my acquaintance could approach . Her father was dead , and her mother  --  well , one was n't sure what to think about her mother . The girl had little to do with her classmates , especially with the other girls , although there were a few notable exceptions : one or two girls of the most respectable sort claimed her as their close friend . We boys lusted after her with our eyes and our speech , of course , but before her cool , experienced manner we were clumsy and abashed . She regarded the lot of us as puppies , I 'm sure . The relationship between Betty June and me commenced when she fell in love with one Smitty Herrin , a **28;9624;TOOLONG who lived two houses from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , and she got the habit that winter of spending much time in and around my house , hoping that Smitty would notice her . I was delighted . Betty June told me all her troubles  --  and they were such dramatic , such real troubles ! Woman had never loved man , it seemed to me , as she loved Smitty , and yet he ignoredp126her . She would n't have cared what he did to her  --  he might beat her and curse her ( what a thrilling notion to a seventeenyear-old ! )  --  if only he 'd acknowledge her devotion , but he ignored her . She would even have suffered torture for him ( together we dreamed up the tortures she 'd be willing to suffer , considering each solemnly ) ; would even have died for him ( we discussed , in detail , various unpleasant deaths ) for the slightest crumb of reciprocal passion . But Smitty remainedoblivious . I was violently sympathetic , and helping her articulate her grievances I discovered that I could conversemore easily and naturally with her than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment , as there was with other girls , nor was there the necessity to impress that falsified all my communication with my male companions . Moreover , the things Betty June discussed were of a new and thrilling order  --  I felt mature and wise and confident , discussing them , and I found myself able to think more liberally , compassionately , and judiciously than I 'd ever thought before . In fact , reader , I should say that it was here , at just this point , that I lost my innocence . Of what concern is it to me that eventually I made love to her ? But Betty June , thin skinny Betty , she broke the seal of my mind , which had been before her coming an idle enough instrument ; took from me my intellectual virginity , which is childishness and naivete , and opened my eyes to the world of men and women  --  and this gently , and with warmth . A lucky virgin , I , to fall into those meager arms and pathetic problems ; what she took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the house nearly every afternoon , after school , and stayed until the housekeeper came to prepare supper . On Saturdays she often spent nearly the whole day with me . We would sit alone , either in the living room or in Dad 's study  --  I preferred the study  --  and I would fix drinks for us , often lacing them with rum or whiskey filched from thep127butler 's pantry . And we talked and talked and talked , easily , sympathetically , wedding her experience with my articulation . I could feel myself expanding , maturing in the bath of her lean life , flexing the muscles of my rationality and my understanding . I 've no real way of knowing how Betty June felt  --  whether she sensed the growing power in me or regardedme merely as a harmless colt . There came a time , alas , when , colt no more , I felt every inch a stud , a stallion , a stone-horse ! and regarding her leanness , perched on the couch , with nostrils all but quivering . Those were embarrassing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so crude as to approach her , our peculiar rapport would vanish . Besides  --  the chasm yawned , the mystery  --  what if she were to submit ? " Your ice is melting , " Betty June would observe , and I would hide myself in my drink . Up to this point  --  late winter , perhaps February  --  I had , be it said to my credit , remained fairly objective about the matter . I understood that Betty June was in love with Smitty ; that she found in me only a sort of spiritual brother ; that both she and Smitty were people whom , at bottom , I did not really respect ; that , finally , one of her chief attractions was her possibility : the tantalizing fact that unlike most of the girls in my set , Betty June was experienced , and that it was therefore not entirely impossible thatHow many aching , perspiring nights I placed on the altar of that remote , teasing possibility ! One afternoon she came over to where I sat in Dad 's leather study chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expertly , and while I drew on the cigarette she ran her free hand playfully through my hair . I gasped and caught her arm instantly ; she laughed and fell into my lap . I took the cigarette from my mouth and crushed her lips with a violent kiss . She grew skittish , playful , but she did n't move away , and I kissed her again and again , passionately . I could scarcelyitp128believe my good fortune ; I was so emotional I could n't speak . Betty June still laughed softly , and kissed back  --  no girl had done that to me !  --  and pinched , and nuzzled , and caught my ears , nose , and eyebrows gently in her teeth . I began pawing her flat chest clumsily , sure I 'd be slapped , but she stretched and made no objection . Incredible ! I had a field day . At three-thirty she left me to marvel at my good luck . From that day on our relationship was of a different sort . She still regarded me as harmless , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was wonderful , beautiful sport ; every afternoon ended with my transgressing the boundaries she 'd tacitly drawn , pleading with her to surrender to me  --  confident in the knowledge that she would not . Then she would leave . How my opinion changed ! My objectivity was peeled off with her chemise , and tossed unwanted into the corner . I came to loathe Smitty ; to rail at him inwardly  --  for Betty June allowed not a word of criticism ; to lay elaborate plans for his ruin . I wept furiously whenever she spoke of her love for him , and she pressed my wet face to her small breast . I solemnly regarded my love  --  it had never been voiced  --  as a thing inviolable , out of reach ; a hot , virginal intercourse of souls . I went about looking wan and distracted , brooding , melancholy . My friends kept a respectful distance ; none , I think , knew of Betty June 's visits . I regarded us as lost souls , condemned by the Fates ( Clotho , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeping at the justice of their names ) never to consummate our love , separated by prior commitments and by barriers of position and caste ( be sure I never mentioned this to her ! ) , etcetera , etcetera . Thus until March 2 , 1917  --  my seventeenth birthday . I was n't expecting Betty June until that afternoon , and I had decided to spend the morning  --  it must have been a holiday  --  knocking down the weathered frame of my unfinished boat , which still stood rotting in the back yard . But no sooner hadp129Dad gone to court , and the housekeeper to her sister 's place , as she always did , than Betty June came running into the house , weeping crazily . I grabbed her and held her tightly , and when she refused to calm herself I shook her by the shoulders  --  it seemed a manly thing to do , and it worked . She still sobbed and whimpered , but less violently . " What 's the matter with you ? " I demanded , so frightened by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembled under me . " Smitty 's married ! " she cried , jerkily . " What ? " She nodded , sniffing and shuddering . " He 's been married secretly to Mona Johnston for a year , " she said , " and all that time I was  --  " " Shut up ! " I commanded dramatically . " Do n't even say it ! " I had decided to be strong . " Now he 's got her in trouble , and her folks are making them announce it . " " Good for them ! " I said toughly . " Serves the bastard right ! " " No ! " Betty June wailed , loosing fresh tears . " Now he 's enlisted in the Army , because he ca n't stand Mona any more ! He 's going overseas , Toddy ! I 'll never see him again ! " She threatened to break down completely . " Tough luck ! " I sneered , very proud of my new strength . Betty June ran into the study and collapsed on the leather couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butler 's pantry , and took a good pull of bourbon , right from the bottle . It scalded clear to my stomach , set my blood on fire . I gave Betty June a few minutes to cry ( and to wonder what I was doing ) ; then I took another swig of bourbon , choked on it , replaced the bottle , and went to the study , walking with exaggerated precision . Betty June , her eyes red , looked up at me dubiously , not knowing what to expect . I said nothing ( could n't have if I 'd wanted to ) . I sat care/fully on the edge of the couch and with one wrench opened her blouse . Ah , I was in no mood for trifling ! " Do n't rip it , " Betty June whimpered , recovering her composure . " That 's your problem , " I growled , and gave her a bruising kiss . " If you do n't want ' em ripped , take ' em off yourself . " She sat up at once and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watched impassively . " You quitting there ? " I demanded sarcastically , just as a matter of form . Betty Jean regarded me for a moment with a new expression on her face : a deliberating , calculating expression . Then she stood up , and unbuttoning her placket , let her long skirt fall to the floor . Quickly she stripped off her petticoat , and without the least hesitation , her shoes , stockings , and bloomers , and stood before me nude . I very nearly swooned . Luckily I had the presence of mind to embrace her at once , so that I was out of range of her eyes . " Take me upstairs , " she moaned . I was petrified , now that the opportunity was at hand . Take her upstairs ! My mind raced frantically , seeking honorableexcuses . " Suppose somebody comes home ? " I croaked . " I 'll run to the bathroom , " she whispered . Obviously she was no novice at this sort of thing . " Come on , get my clothes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin , to the stairs . I retrieved her clothing and followed after , scared to death ; soon , in my bedroom , cluttered like a museum with the relics of my boyhood , she received that boyhood happily , and kissed me , as I chose to think , for making her its custodian . I should have kissed her , for no hot bump of a boy ever had defter instruction . I have been uncommonly lucky with women , surely through no virtue of my own . What follows is perhaps indiscreet , but it is the point of the story.  |p131A  seventeen-year-old boy is insatiable . His lust is like a tall weed , which crushed repeatedly under the mower springs up again , green and unbowed . He is easily aroused and quickly satisfied , and easily aroused again . New to the manners of the business , I cried like a baby , bleated like a goat , and roared like a lion , by turns . The time came , the lesson , when I was stallion indeed . . . need I explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresser , beside us  --  an unusually large mirror , that gave back our images fulllengthand life-size  --  and there we were : Betty June 's face buried in the pillow ; me gangly as a whippet and braying like an ass . It was marvelously funny ; I exploded with laughter ! " What 's the matter ? " Betty June asked sharply . I tossed and rolled and roared with laughter ; Betty June was blindly angry . " Well I do n't see anything funny ! " I could n't answer . I could n't comfort the nervous tears that ran from her , though I swear I tried . I could n't help her at all , or myself . I bellowed and snorted with laughter , long after Betty June had fumed out of my bed , out of my room , out of my house , for the last time . I laughed through lunch , to Dad 's amusement ( and subsequent irritation ) . I laughed that night when I undressed . I have said that my experience in the Argonne , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrationsof my animality , and so it was . This was the first . Nothing is intrinsically funny , to be sure , but to me nothing is so consistently , profoundly , earth-shakingly funny as we animals in the act of mating . Reader , if you are young and would live on love ; if in the flights of intercourse you feel that you and your beloved are fit models for a Phidias , for a Michelangelo  --  then do n't , I implore you , be so foolish as to include among the trappings of your love-nest a good plate mirror . For a mirror can reflect only what it sees , and what it sees is screamingly funny.  |p132Well  . I never laughed at poor Betty June again , because a few days after my birthday I enlisted in the Army . Smitty was killed ; I was not . Mona Johnston married someone else . Betty June , I learned upon my return from service , had becomea prostitute during the war , first in Cambridge , and then  --  when after the Armistice it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I next saw her , it was under entirely different circumstances . I 've not heard anything from her for years . Think me heartless  --  I 'm sure I am  --  but even as I write this now , thirty-seven years later , though my heart goes out to pitiful Betty , generous Betty , nevertheless I ca n't expunge that mirror from my mind ; I think of it and must smile . To see a pair of crabs , of dogs , of people  --  even lovely , graceful Jane-I ca n't finish , reader , ca n't hold my pen fast to the line : I am convulsed ; I am weeping tears of laughter on the very page !  |p133A  good habit to acquire , if you are interested in disciplining your strength , is the habit of habit-breaking . For one thing , to change your habits deliberately on occasion prevents you from being entirely consistent ( I believe I explained the virtuesof limited inconsistency earlier ? ) ; for another , it preventsyour becoming any more a vassal than you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Do you part your hair on the left ? Try not parting it at all . Do you sleep on your left side , to the right of your wife ? Sleep on your stomach , on her left . You have hundreds of habits : habits of dress , of manner , of speech , of eating , of thought , of aesthetic taste , of moral conduct . Break them now and then , deliberately , and institute new ones in their places for a while . It will slow you up sometimes , but you 'll tend to grow strong and feel free . To be sure , do n't break all your habits . Leave some untouched forever ; otherwise you 'll be consistent . Now , in deciding to see Marvin Rose for a physical examinationI was accomplishing two things at once : the appointment was extraordinary , and that fact gave an element of inconsistency to my last day on earth , which I 'd decidedp134to live routinely . At the same time , I was breaking a thirteenyear-oldhabit of not seeing doctors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he prescribedfor my infected prostate . At the time , I had just enrolled in law school and he was interning at the Johns Hopkins Hospital ; we had been fraternity brothers as undergraduatesat the University , and were dependable , if not intimate , friends . It was a terrible morning that I went to him  --  drunken , bloody , half-conscious , aching  --  where he worked in the outpatient department of the old brown hive . He washed me up , gave me some kind of pill to swallow , perhaps even administered a needle . What he said , finally , was , " Stay here for a few days , Toddy . " I intended to refuse , but it seems I fainted ; when I was conscious again I was hospitalized , and within a few hours , upon my being examined  --  painfully !  --  the infection was discovered . Although I was n't aware of it at the time , Marvin 's words had terminated a phase of my life , for upon my dischargefrom the hospital a month later , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunken animal ; I walked out a saint . The story is neither religious nor long . Of the noises in my life , one of the very loudest in my memory is the tiny popping puncture of my bayonet in the German sergeant 's neck  --  that sergeant with whom I choose to think my soul had lain for a while . Were I ever so foolish as to try , I 'm quite sure I could close my eyes and hear that puncture as distinctly now as I heard it then , and the soft slide of my metal into his throat . To a noise like that , thirtysixyears is a snap of the fingers , a blink of the eye . Of the human voices I have heard , one of the very clearest in my memory is the gravelly , somnolent Missouri voice of Capt . John Frisbee , the army doctor who examined me after a heart attack just prior to my discharge . Here are his very words :  | " Ah sweah , Cawpr'l , if that is n't endocahditis yew got ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boy ? Yew too young to have a haht attack , now ah n't yew ? " He shook his head , examined me again to make sure , and then wrote his report , which he explained to me as gently as his naturally blunt manner would permit . " The endocahditis is n't so bad , son ; that 's what clubbed yew fingahs , and it should of kept yew a civilian . It wo n't git no worse . The bad thing is that yew liable to have a myocandialinfahction  --  and that can very likely kill yew . Might be any second ; might be a yeah from now ; might be nevah . But yew just as well know ' bout it . Ah do n't subscrahb to this secrecy hoss-m'nure , d'yew ? " Can you understand at once  --  you must , for I neither can nor will explain it  --  that I was relieved ? To say that the puncturehad deranged me in any way would be too crude , but  --  well , I was relieved , that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be my last . My first impulse , after my discharge , was to rush home as quickly as possible , in order to say farewell to Dad and my town before I fell dead . Every time the train slowed for a crossing I squirmed and fidgeted , sure I 'd never reach Cambridgealive . But I did . Dad welcomed me warmly , and seemed so happy to have me safely home that I had n't the courage to tell him the tragic news at once  --  though of course I must n't wait too long , or my sudden death might surprise him , coming unprepared-for . I decided to gamble on a week , during which time I idled nervously around the big house , unable to concentrate on anything . But at the week 's end , when one night Dad called me into his study , and I resolved to tell him at once , he forestalled me by speaking first . " Cheer up , Toddy , " he laughed  --  I must have looked glum . " I did n't call you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was alive ! What I 've got on my mind is serious , but it is n't solemn . " He was feeling very good , very affectionate . He handed me a cigar , and I sat on the leather couch and smoked it . " Toddy , the first thing I want you to do , if it 's all right with you , is take a vacation  --  from now till fall . Do n't feel obliged to stay here unless you feel like it  --  go anywhere you want to . For spending money you 've got a pretty good wad in Liberty bonds that I banked for you while you were away . " I just listened , hoping my heart would last until he finished , so that I could explain . " Then when September comes , son , nothing could make me happier than if you 'd go to school . " He grinned . " I sha n't specify Johns Hopkins , but I must say that that 's where the bright men are coming from , lately . Then , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And do it right , in a law school ; not in an office like I did . But again , I sha n't even specify the law . I do want you to go to school , though , son  --  after a vacation . See if you can spend your whole bank account by Septem-ber ! " I must say that at that moment I felt wonderful about my father . His concern over me , the ( for him ) remarkable psychologyof his approach , his generosity  --  all these , I see now , were ordinary sentiments , not unusual in themselves ; but then I was a very ordinary sort of young man , too , at the time , and the sentiments , if commonplace , were nonetheless uncommonly strong . My ailing heart felt lodged in my throat ; I could n't speak . Seeing my hesitation , Dad busied himself attending to his cigar . His smile perhaps set a little , but it did not disappear . " Do n't answer , " he said then . " Do n't say anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " I protested , " no , it 's  --  " " Not a word , " Dad insisted , sure of himself again . " What a crude fellow I am , calling you in here without a word ofp137notice and springing a whole life 's plans on you ! A fine son you 'd be , come to think of it , if you ever agreed to anything that drastic without a little thought first ! " His spirits were high again . " Get out now , " he ordered cheerfully . " Go get a little tight or something , like a veteran 's supposed to . I sha n't listen to a word you say about this at least until tomorrow , if not next week . Go on , now , git ! " And he buried his attention in pretended business on his desk . Well , I worried for a day or so  --  and he did too , poor fellow , thinking I did n't like his proposal  --  and finally decided that , since I was after all still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might as well leave Dad happy by enrolling in college : he would have the satisfaction of knowing he 'd done all a father could do for me . Besides , why tell him about my heart ? Why make both suffer , when there was no help for it ? " I 'm going to Hopkins , Dad , " I announced one morning at breakfast , " and then to Maryland Law School , if it 's all right with you . And I do n't know if this is right or not to ask , but I 'd like it if when I get out I could eventually set up here in town , like you did , maybe as a junior partner or something . " Dad did n't say a word . He was so happy his eyes watered , and he had to fold his napkin and get up from the breakfast table . I was certainly glad I 'd said what I said . So I went to Johns Hopkins , enrolled in the pre-law curriculum . At Dad 's suggestion I joined a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in the fraternity house . I must say that if one has to go to college under the conditions I went under , the early twenties was an excellent time to go . It seemed to me that nearly all of my fraternity brothers expected , like myself , to fall dead any moment , for they lived each day as though it were to be their last . Their way of life suited my feelings exactly , and I soon made myselfone of them . We stayed drunk for days at a time . We set fire to the men 's rooms in night clubs , ignited smudge pots in the streets , installed cows in unexpected places . Wep138brawled and fought , made nuisances of ourselves , spent nights in jail sobering up . We kept women in the house overnight , in violation of University and chapter rules  --  night-club strippers , prostitutes , strange ladies , college girls  --  and we paid fines for it ; some of us were justifiably expelled from the University . We went on adulterous weekend trips to Washington and New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and once a fantastic bullfrog hunt in the DorchesterMarshes south of Cambridge . We fell from speeding automobiles , and were hospitalized ; occasionally even fought real honest-to-goodness duels , and were hospitalized . One of us died in an automobile crash , drunk . Two of us were obliged to marry girls inadvertently made pregnant . Three of us were withdrawn from the University by irate parents . One of us committed suicide with sleeping pills and was discoveredat the autopsy to be syphilitic . Three of us turned into chronic alcoholics . Perhaps a dozen of us were dismissed from school for failing courses . Does this sound like a satire , a parody of student life in the early twenties ? It is , indeed , a thing easily parodied , but remember that the parodies did n't appear out of the air : they were written mostly by men who lived through just this sort of life . It reads like a parody to me , too  --  but that 's how it was . One thing more , which perhaps distinguished my crowd from similarly exuberant groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us who did n't flunk out got an education  --  it is difficult to remain long at Hopkins and escapeeducation . It was we who followed the real tradition of the chapter and , to some extent , of the University : studentensleben , in the manner of the old German universities . We drank hard , caroused hard , studied hard , and slept little . We crammed for examinations , drank black coffee , chewed cigarettes , took benzedrine  --  and read books , quizzed each other for days , and read more books , and asked more questions . The ones who failed were not really a part of us : the goal wasp139to drink the most whiskey , fornicate the most girls , get the least sleep , and make the highest grades . I for one am thankfulthat studying was part of the sport , because otherwise I certainly should n't have bothered with it , knowing I 'd not live to take my bachelor 's degree . To be sure , most of us remembered nothing two days after the final examinations ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the men , the professors , the fine , independent minds of Johns Hopkins  --  thematurity , the absence of restrictions , the very air of Homewood , that nourished the strong seeds of reason in our ruined bodies ; the disinterested wisdom that refused even to see our ridiculous persons in the lecture halls ; that talked , as it were , to itself , and seemed scarcely to care when some of us began to listen , to listen intently , fiercely , passionately . I lived through 1920 , through 1921 , through 1922 , through 1923 . In the summers I lived on at the fraternity house and worked as a stonemason , a brush salesman , a factory laborer , a life guard at one of the city pools , a tutor of history , even , and once actually a ditchdigger . To my great surprise I was alive on commencement day , if not entirely sober , and lived to walk off Gilman Terrace with my diploma  --  pale , weak , educated . I had lost twenty pounds , countless prejudices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ) , and my religion . I had gained a capacity for liquor and work ; an ability to take beatings ; a familiarity with card games , high society , and whorehouses ; a taste for art and Marxism ; and a habit of thinking that would ultimately lead me at least beyond the latter . My college years are as interesting , to me , as my time in the Army , but no more of them than what I 've mentioned is relevant here . Because at summer 's end I was still alive and had to have something to do , I went ahead with my program and began reading the law at the University of Maryland Law School , in downtown Baltimore . I no longer lived in the fraternityp140house  --  in an adolescently idealistic moment I had proposed amending the Order 's constitution to admit Jews and Negroes , and had brought the righteous wrath of Beta Alpha upon my head . Instead , I had a marvelous fourth-floor room in a huge , ancient row-house  --  it must once have been palatial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room suggested to me by Marvin Rose . My neighbors and companions were medical students ; the atmosphere was intense , electric with work , exhausting  --  more deadly serious than before , perhaps ( for we were no longer undergraduates ) , but not more sober . With Marvin I rode in ambulances on night duty , learned first aid , hardened my stomach to carnagethat equaled Argonne 's , made love to certain nurses and strange  --  very strange !  --  female patients , and drank . I read Justices Holmes and Cardozo , and the Spanish and Italian legal philosophers ; I studied criminal law , torts , wills , legal Latin . With the medical students , achievement , competence , even brilliance , were still part of the sport : I drove myself , disciplined myself , whipped myself ; drank much , read much , slept little . When I was discharged from the Army I 'd weighed 18o pounds ; on commencement day at Hopkins I weighed 16o ; by the end of my first year at law school I was down to 145 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told myself  --  for no one else suspected my Damocletian heart . One night in mid-December of 1924 ( I believe it was the last night before the Christmas holiday at both the law school and the medical school , though this is uncertain  --  it may have been before some sort of examination ) , Marvin and some of his colleagues proposed going out on the town , and since I happened to have thirty dollars , I agreed . I was the more eager to drink because all that day I 'd had strange , sharp pains in my lower abdomen  --  too low for appendicitis . Walking had n't soothed them , nor had lying down , and so I looked forward to a pleasant general anesthesia.  | " Dinner , " Marvin announced , and six of us took two cabs to Miller Brothers ' for crab imperial . I ached all through the meal . " Drink , " he announced later , and we took a bus out to a speakeasy near the hospital , one patronized by the medical students , and got somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divertissement ! " announced someone a few hours later  --  we were five , then , because Marvin had to go on duty in the outpatient department for the rest of the night  --  and the whole party adjourned to a house of joy that someone else had heard of on North Calvert Street , about halfway to the University . We rode out in a cab . Someone put something in the one whiskey bottle from which most of us drank  --  I 'm no toxicologist , and so I ca n't say what it was . When we disembarkedwe were loud , rough , and on the verge of helplessness . Twice in the next half hour I nearly fainted , and not from liquor but from the fiery pains in my abdomen . I could scarcely wait to get a woman , for apart from the blessing of lying down , I had an inebriate notion that sex might relieve the pain . Someone must have done my selecting for me ; I 'm sure I neither saw nor cared which of the girls I went upstairs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companions hollered from down a hallway , just as my girl and I were entering a bedroom . " Hol ' on ! " " No , " I called back politely . " Hol ' on ! " my colleague hollered again , and came lurchingdown the hall , pulling a girl behind him . " I got a lady here knows you all from ' way back , boy . " " Oh , " I said , and went into the room where my girl was waiting . " Oh nothing ! " the medical student cried , striding in be/hind me . " Why take a total stranger when right of buddy ? I 'm swappin ' with you . " The new girl was apologizing to my girl for being dragged in . " You guys better get straightened out quick , " my girl snapped , " or I 'm callin ' Cozy to bounce you . " I fell on the bed , dizzy almost to vomiting . I felt as though a hot needle , a hot bayonet , were piercing  --  what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing in the center of the room , holding on to a bedpost for support , and Betty June Gunter , not a day older than she had been in 1917 , was sitting on the bed , holding a cigarette in her hand , dangling a slipper from one foot , smiling mockingly at me . I could see now ; in fact I felt much more sober , but I was certainly suffering to the point of delirium . " Glad to see you , Toddy , " Betty June said sarcastically . " I 'm not going to talk , if you do n't mind , " I said carefully , holding on to my pain . " We 'd never get it all said , and if it 's all the same to you , I  --  " What happened was that I collapsed then . After that Betty June had slipped off her one-piece whore 's dress and I was holding her . If six years of prostitution had changed her at all , I could n't see how . I remember wishing I were entirelysober and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my meeting her , and also talk to her coherently . As far as I can tell , I was passing out every few minutes from my pain . At one point she asked me , " Do you hurt , Toddy boy ? " " I 'm damn near dead , " I admitted . Then she was leaning over me , rubbing my chest and arms with rubbing alcohol . " What the hell . " " Service of the house , " she grinned . There was a tremendous racket outside in the hall andp143downstairs . I believe my medical colleagues were destroying the whorehouse . My original plan for relief occurred to me , but it was apparentlyout of the question : the pain unmanned me . I was perspiring . Now Betty June was sitting perched at my feet , and was massaging my legs with the alcohol . Her business had not improved her bustline , I observed , but neither had it hardenedher good eyes . I wished I were sober so that I could judge better how she felt about me . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wondered whether she knew Smitty was dead . " You know Smitty 's dead , " I remarked . Her expression , a puckered smile , did n't change . Her eyes followed her hands , rubbing my legs . What I finally said  --  rather loudly , for the noise outside the door was incessant  --  was , " Damn it , honey , I owe you an apology . I wish this pain were n't so bad , I 'd do things right for you , no laughing . That time in my room back home , I swear , I  --  " That was when , still without any change of expression at all , Betty June emptied the whole bottle of rubbing alcohol in the worst possible place . I hollered and leaped from the bed ; I clutched myself and rolled on the floor . Stupendous pain ! The two together were inconceivable ! To make things worse , Betty June fell upon me , still smiling . She struck at me with the alcohol bottle , coolly , putting all her small strength into each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault , the crack of the bottle on my arm or elbow was punishment enough in itself . I pushed and kicked her away , but to stand up was beyond my power . I felt exactly as though I were on fire . Betty June had got the bottle broken by this time , and she came at me with the jagged neck of it . I rolled away and struck desperately at her , but it was a losing fight . Everyp144parry cost me a slash on the arm , across the knuckles , in the palm of my hand . When I finally got a grip on her right wrist , she kicked and bit violently . What I wanted to do , what I tried to do , was break her arm , if possible , to slow her up . That 's what I was attempting when the room filled with people . " Cozy ! " Betty June cried . There was an enormous din . I did n't dare let go of Betty June 's arm , although I was apparently too weak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt like going to sleep ; I had the strongest impulse to say , " Let 's be friends , honey , " and go to sleep right on her poor thin arm , there on the floor . Why is n't the whole thing a sailboat ? I remember wonderingthrough the pain that was crucifying me ; then I could let go of everything , tiller and sheets , and the boat would lull up into the wind and hang in stays , and I could sleep . Cozy must have been a quite competent bouncer . I daresayhe rabbit-punched me , considering the circumstances and the additional pain in the back of my neck when I woke up next , but I did n't even feel the blow when it fell . Cozy had stuffed me into the back seat of somebody 's parked automobile , on the floor . I had my shirt and trousers and shoes on , loosely , but no underwear , necktie , stockings , coat , or overcoat . Three-inch adhesive tape had been rolled roughly around my slashed arm  --  Cozy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premises  --  and since no major blood vessels had been severed , the bleeding had virtually stopped , but not before daubing my clothes . My neck exploded with throbbing pains ; I still burned , though not quite so severely  --  horrible few minutes !  --  and the mysterious original pain continued undiminished . I crawled out of the car after a while . I still had my wrist watch : it was four in the morning . What part of town was I in ? I kept close to the wall of row-houses along the street , both to steady myself and to shelter myself from the cold ,  |p145and  walked as best I could to the corner gas lamp . As is usual in the poorer neighborhoods , the street signs around the lamp were broken off . I turned the corner and walked numbly for an infinity of uninhabited city blocks , all fronted with infinities of faceless , featureless , identical row-houses and nightmare lines of marble steps like snaggled teeth . Then came the second coincidence of the evening : I had been walking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remotest cranny of the universe ; I half-fell around a corner , and I was on Monument Street  --  civilized , brightly lighted , filled with automobiles and streetcars even at four o'clock . The brown Victorian pile of Hopkins Hospital stood waiting , just across the street , disgorging frequent screaming ambulances into the city , and swallowing others as frequently . A flurry of lights and a succession of strong smells , and presently I was sitting in a hard chair in a corridor of the hospital . There was much glare ; soft hustlings of carts , stretchers , nurses , orderlies ; muffled clinkings of instruments and glass ; laughter in the distance ; activity , busyness , all around my hard chair where I sat holding my head tightly . Everybody was awake in the hospital ; I felt so safe I wanted to vomit . Marvin Rose was saying , " Stay here for a few days , Toddy . " Then I was in the ward  --  had slept for a long time and was in little pain  --  and when I opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before I could explain to her whateverit was that I felt explosively needed explaining , her needle had made quite the wrong small popping puncture ( more felt than heard , to be sure ) in the white underskin of my forearm , and I fainted another time . Few things , I venture , are more sickeningly uncomfortable to a man than a needle biopsy . The horrible instrument opened the secret of my pain to the doctor who attended me . A severely infected prostate  --  most unusual in a twenty-four/year-old man . And my health was generally broken down . I remained in the ward for a month , with little to do but think . Here are the things I thought about , lying long hours immobilewith closed eyes : my imminent , instant death ; the futility , for me , of plans and goals ; the tight smile on Betty June 's lips ( she had n't laughed ) ; the sound of punctured skin . I thought at times coherently , at times dizzily , moving from one subject to the next and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the causes from the effects in my month 's thinking , but when I was finally discharged I had decided with my whole being that I was " out of it " ; that the pursuits , the goals , the enthusiasms of the world of men were not mine . My stance had been wrong , I concluded : the great fact with which I had to live was not to be escaped in whiskey and violence , not even in work . What I must do , I reasoned , is keep it squarely before me all the time ; live with it soberly , looking it straight in the eye . There was more to my new attitude , but it was a matter of the rearrangement of abstractions , not really important here . The visible effects on my behavior were primarily these : I still drank , but no longer got drunk . I smoked , but not nervously . I took women to bed only in the rare cases when it was they who had assumed the initiative , and then I was thorough but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but no longer intensely , no longer in frenzied spasms . I talked less . I began in earnest what was to be a long process of assuming hard control over myself : the substitution of small , specific strengths for small , specific weaknesses , regarding the latter with the same unresentful disfavor with which one regards a speck of dust on one 's coat sleeve , before plucking it quietly off . I unconsciously began to regard my fellow men variously as more or less pacific animals among whom it was generally safe to walk ( so long as one observed certain tacitly assumed rules ) , or as a colony of more or less quiet lunatics amongp147whom it was generally safe to live ( so long as one humored , at least outwardly , certain aspects of their madness ) . There have been other changes in my attitude during my life , but none altered my outward behavior and manner so markedly as this one . I was uninvolved ; I was unmoved ; I was a saint . I was , or so I believed then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e.g. , the female PapiIio cenea  --  I did learn my zoology between drinks ) who , themselves defenseless , mimic outwardly the more numerous species among which they live : appropriately , the so-called " nauseous " Danais , whose bad taste and smell render them relatively safe . At least when walking their streets , I had to pretend to be like all the other butterflies  --  but at heart I knew I was of another species entirely , perhaps a less nauseousone . I continued , therefore , my study of law , as part of the mimicry ; at Marvin 's prescription I began taking a capsule of diethylstilbestrol every day ; and I awaited more quietly the moment of death . In my good time I meditated , disinterestedly , that tight , puckered smile on the face of the female human being who had intended to kill me . And , for the next thirteen years , though the prostate continued to give me frequent pain , I ceased to share that pain with physicians . ' Who ever heard of a saint 's crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Marvin shouted ( in 1937 ) when I stepped into his office . He rubbed his hands gleefully . " Corninghome to die , are you ? What 'll it be , Todd my lad , euthanasiaor homicide ? What the hell , you pregnant ? " " A plain old physical examination , Marv , " I said . " Going to buy some insurance , man ? I 'll lie for you . Hell , boy , I 'll euthanaze you . " " None of your business . Come on , examine . " But we smoked a cigar first , and Marvin reminisced about Baltimore . When he got around to examining me , I said :  | " Will you go along with me on something , Marvin ? " " Where 's the body ? Who we got it in for ? What 'd you do , Todd ? " " You can examine me to your heart 's content , " I said , " but I do n't want you to say a word about anything you see or find ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even examine you if you say so , you big sissy . I 'll call Shirley in here and let her look at you . What you say , boy ? " " Just write it all down , " I smiled , " and either mail it to me or drop it off at the hotel . The point is that I do n't want to know anything at all , at least until tomorrow . Okay ? " " Okay , " Marvin grinned ; " you 're the doctor . " He then went through the examining routine , talking all the while he checked my height , weight , eyes , ears , nose , throat , and teeth . Then I stripped to the waist , and with stethoscope , watch , and sphygmomanometer he checked my heart , my pulse , and my blood pressure , keeping the expressionlessface I 'd asked for . Then he tapped my chest and back , listening for congestion , and felt my vertebrae . Finally I removed trousers and underwear , and he tapped my knee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked for hemorrhoids and flat feet , all without any alteration of expression . " How about a blood test and a urinalysis ? " he asked . I produced a urine specimen , but declined the blood test . " How 's the old prostate ? Been keeping her empty ? " " No trouble , " I said . " Sure raised hell that one time , did n't it ? I swear I wanted to cut her out for you , Toddy ; you would n't have had another twinge . But that screwball Hodges  --  remember him ? the resident ?  --  hewas having a feud with O'Donnell , the surgeon , that year , over politics , and was n't letting anybody get cut . Goddam Hodges ! I swear he 'd have tried to amputate a leg with his damn internal medicine ! What a bunch ! " He madep149some notes on an examination form and slipped it into an envelope . " Here y'are , lad , the whole sad story . How about a little old needle biopsy ? Have a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's fun for me . Give you an appetite . Make you dance and holler . " " Let it go , " I said , and began dressing . " No needle , huh ? " Marvin said . " How am I supposed to know what 's what ? How about an X-ray , raise your bill a few bucks ? " " Drop the paper off any time after today , " I said , acceptingfrom Marvin another light for my cigar , which had gone out . " Please keep everything under your hat , Marv . " " I do n't blame you , " Marvin said , walking me to the door with his arm across my shoulders . " I 'd be ashamed , too . " We shook hands . " Well , hell , Toddy , it 's been fun . Do n't wait so long next time . And listen , by Christ , if the old prostate commences to hurt you , I 'll cut it out . You ought to keep check , boy . " I smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Come on down to the hospital Mondayfor an X-ray , and I 'll bet I can take her right out , clean as a whistle . " " Wait till Monday , " I said . " But do n't hold your breath . " We said goodbye , and Marvin went back to lie down on the examination table for a nap . He was ( I 'm late saying it ) a beefy little man with sparse blond hair , flushed skin , and tiny red veins in his cheeks . His arms and hands were so full of meat that it seemed as if the skin of them were ready to burst , like overboiled frankfurters . It would be pleasant to be able to go on and say of Marvin 's great hands that , awkwardas they appeared , the moment they were slipped into surgeon 's gloves they assumed the grace , deftness , and delicatestrength of a violinist 's . This is the sort of thing one usually hears . But the truth is that those clumsy-looking hands , once slipped into surgical gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clumsy arms and ultimately from a somewhat clumsy brain . The truth is that the magnificent Hopkins does not infallibly produce . faultlessmedicine men ; the truth , alas , is that in fact I should be markedly reluctant , even were I not opposed to it on principle , to allow my excellent friend Marvin to incise me with his not-altogether-unerring knives . The fact of affection need n't , I trust , entirely preclude objectivity ?  |p151One  does n't just move on without giving that tight smile , Betty June 's puckered smile , some further attention . Mere drunkenness and pain are no excuse for my not having realized , until she was upon me with the bottle , that I had done to Betty June a thing warranting murder at her hands ( I am , by the way , reasonably confident that it was Betty June in the Calvert Street whorehouse , although I was certainlydrunk ) . She wanted to kill me , I see now , for having laughed that time in my bedroom . Here 's how I understand it : that Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to whom she had unreservedly humbled herself , had all the while been marriedsecretly to Mona Johnston , from Henry Street , and had made Mona pregnant . In desperation , Betty June had come to me and had attempted  --  unconsciously , I daresay  --  to reasserther wounded ego by humbling me with the great gift of her body , a lean receptacle for my innocence . But in the throes of intercourse I had laughed , so violently as to unman myself , and could n't even stanch her shocked and injured tears for very helplessness . Quite understandably she had assumed that I was laughing at her , at some ridiculousness ofp152her , although this was not particularly true . And then  --  what ? Smitty and I both enlisted , he was killed , and she became a prostitute . Ordinarily , perhaps , it would have been possible for her to rationalize her behavior , first as a patriotic gesture and later as gaining a livelihood from " the oldest profession "  --  but she had my laughter in her ears to remind her , every time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was something ludicrous about her and about what she was doing . For many sorts of people , and Betty June is one of them , this suspicion would be nearly intolerable . So : seven years later , when she 's doubtless so deeply enmired in the business and all its attendant vices that she ca n't very well escape ( I think of pimps and narcotics , for example ) , seven years later I show up party-drunk at her whorehouse  --  looking prosperous and smug to her , no doubt  --  accept her as my whore without a word , and only later , after permitting her to massage my body , refer with vague regret to the time I laughed at her . Do n't you agree that this is probably how it was ? I ca n't account otherwise for her murderousness ( yet I must say , though I can scarcely explain it , that if I had n't mentioned the matter , I believe Betty June would have gone through with the intercourse I had paid for ) . The remarkable thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she wanted to kill me  --  even simple shame at being thus discovered could account for that  --  but that I failed to realize it at once ; that I missed the obvious implication of that puckered smile . And this is what I wanted to say , because I consider it fairly important ( hell , even urgently important ) to the understandingof this whole story : quite frequently , things that are obvious to other people are n't even apparent to me . The fact does n't especially bother me , except of course when it leads to my not jumping clear of dangerous animals like poor Betty . If I were called upon to explain it , I should doubtless offend and antagonize you , for the only likely ex/planation I can imagine is that out of any situation I can usuallyinterpret a number of possible significances , often conflicting , sometimes contradictory . Why , for instance , could it not have been that Betty June , after seven years of prostitutionand various unfortunate experiences , had come at last to see , as I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very four-letter verb for which is wittily onomatopoeic  --  and upon encountering me had decided to demonstrate her agreement by a rousing good copulation , at which we 'd both laugh long and loud ? Or , less dramatically , why could it not have been that she 'd forgotten the whole affair in my bedroom , and was smiling merely at my drunkenness , or in anticipation of scorching me with isopropyl alcohol ? Or , less kindly , that observing my helplessness she was smiling at the thought of earning seven dollars for giving me nothing more voluptuous than a rubdown ? Understand , I 'm not especially defending myself : very possibly another person would have seen factors in the situation that would precludeall these alternatives ; or , possibly , another person would n't have imagined these alternatives in the first place . I honestly believe that to most men ( and to any woman ) Betty June 's intentions would have been obvious . To me they were not . On the other hand , things that are clear to me are **25;9654;TOOLONG to others  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book.  |p154I  know of no really good restaurant in Cambridge ; I think there are none . Therefore , since a wide selection of excellent food is out of the question , one 's grounds for choosing a regular eating place are likely to be rather gratuitous . Harrisonand I were in the habit of lunching at a confectionery store on Race Street , beside the old opera house . It was run by an Orphan 's Court judge , an engaging fellow who refused , for purely aesthetic reasons , to serve hot platters : he disliked the smells of cooking in his store . This integrity alone would have attracted me to the place , but the proprietorhad a host of such opinions ; like me , he was in the habit of giving invariably sound , often unorthodox , and not infrequentlypost facto reasons for his behavior , which reasons he was wont to articulate at length to his regular customers in a loud voice , for he was slightly deaf . It was to this place that I walked after leaving Marvin . Race Street was afire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . A number of unclean children were playing violent tag on the wide cracked steps of the opera house , swinging over and under the brown brass rail that led up to the shutteredbox office . On both inner walls of the arcaded facade ,  |p155crusty  with weathered architectural gingerbread , were plasteredposters advertising Adam 's Original &; Unparalleled FIoating Opera . May I say truly that it was not until I 'd actually entered the confectioner 's  --  until the Judge , small , dapper , bald , and boutonniered , had greeted me and I 'd remarked politely that he looked like a million dollars  --  that not until then did I remember that , should I choose , I was in a position to make my friend Harrison worth nearly three million ? It may seem incredible that such a thing could simply slip one 's mind , but it very nearly did . I believe that if the Judge had n't prompted my remark , I 'd have forgotten the matter entirely , perhaps until too late . And I was glad I 'd remembered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could win the case ( all that was necessary was to secure from Equity an order holding up the appeal until the missingportions of the estate  --  the bottles of pickled excrement  --  were accounted for . The thing could be complicated indefinitely , and after the coming elections , when Joe Singer had replaced Rollo Moore on the appellate court bench , I was confident that the Circuit Court judgment would be reversed )  --  although the thing was in my hands , by no means did it necessarily follow that I would do anything about it . Very possibly I would decide to keep the new information secret , let it die that very day with me , instead of giving it to young Jimmy Andrews or Mr. Bishop to work with after my death . For one thing , you must remember that I was , after all , a fairly thoroughgoing cynic at the time , especially concerningmoney ; also  --  and there is nothing cynical about this  --  I believed Harrison was undeserving of the money unless he overcame his former weakness . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy of the inheritance , he had to demonstrate a strength of character that would make the loss of it unimportant : a pretty lofty opinion for a cynic , I'dp156say . At any rate , I decided not to mention Eustacia 's letter right away . I was a few minutes late , and Harrison was waiting for me , talking to the Judge . We went back to our table . " Janie dropped out to the plant just before I drove in , " he said after greeting me . " What are you needling her for ? " " Needling her ? " " That note you sent her this morning , " Harrison said mildly . " You know what I 'm talking about . " " I do now , " I smiled . " I swear I 'd forgotten . " I gave my order to the girl who came to our table then . Harrison had already ordered . " I was n't entirely joking , Harrison . Cap'n Osborn 's got a couple more years , at the most , before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you like a fine send-off like Janie ? Hell , he could n't do anything to her . Are you angry ? " " I was n't before , " Harrison grinned , " because I thought you were just being nasty . But if you 're serious about her showing herself to some old buzzard , I probably ought to get mad . " I held a light for his cigar . He was doing fine so far . " Well , if you want to , " I laughed . " But Janie handled itpretty brightly , I think . Did she tell you about her note ? " " No . " " She said she 'd do what I asked if I 'd agree to let Marvin Rose look at me , to see why I 'm such a pansy . Her very words . " Harrison chuckled , a little relieved . " Fair enough , " he said . " What did she mean , pansy ? Or should n't I ask ? " " You may ask , but ask a little more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I spent most of last night looking out my window , and the rest of the time reading a book . " Harrison looked concerned . " What , Toddy , you getting senile ? " " Quitting while I 'm still ahead , maybe , " I smiled . " As ap157matter of fact , I do n't think Marvin found anything especiallywrong with me , at least not below the belt . I was just up there . " " You were ! " Harrison 's peace of mind vanished . " You actually did what she said ? " " Yep . " The girl brought our lunches : a bacon and tomato sandwichand iced tea for Harrison , and a chopped olive and Swiss cheese on rye for me , with iced coffee . The Judge 's sandwiches were excellent . " Well , what now ? " Harrison asked . " I do n't know what to say . You sure do change your mind about things . " I shrugged . " Do n't worry about it , boy . It 's not your problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the difference either way . " Harrison started to object , but then he changed his mind and bit into his sandwich instead . " All right , " he said , talking with his mouth full . " I wo n't worry about it . " " Good man , " I grinned . Harrison then changed the subject and talked idly about a possible strike of his cucumber picklers . His mouth was still full , and there were three little flecks of mayonnaise on his lower lip . As he spoke , an occasional crumb blew over to me . I admired two things : the casual bad manners that one often encounters in finely bred animals like Harrison ( strict etiquette , I 've long believed , is mostly Emily Post 's wishful thinking ; the aristocrats I 've known generally have a fine disregard for it ) , and the fact that his description of the labor difficulties in his plant suggested neither a pro-union bias from his Marxist days nor an anti-union bias from his present position . He was interested in the situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were making him out to be a slave driver , and his own administrative staff , who advocated firing the lot of them and hiring " newp158niggers " in their places . It seemed to me that cynicism , although he was not entirely at home with it yet , became him a great deal more than had his earlier attempt at saintliness . I listened with some interest , regarding his still-handsome face ( he was forty-three , I guess , and Jane in her early thirties ) and the little drops of mayonnaise , which he finally licked away . We finished our sandwiches and smoked for a while , enjoyingour drinks . The Judge 's store was n't air-conditioned , but he had three big old ceiling fans , and the place was fairly dark and cool . " Oh , by the way , " Harrison said , " Jane was n't in when your secretary called this morning , but the maid took the message , and then apparently you were out when Jane called back . She says she 'll drop Jeannine off at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 's coming uptown to the hairdresser'saround then . " " Swell , " I said . As a matter of fact I was a little disturbed , not at the change of hours ( I had planned to take little Jeannine to see the showboat at four ) , but because my in- k structions to Mrs. Lake  --  to call Jane  --  were the second thing I 'd forgotten in a few hours . No , come to think of it , I 'd had three lapses of memory : Eustacia 's letter , my note to Jane , and my request to Mrs. Lake . This was a serious matter , for it could be taken as a sign of nervousness , of apprehension at my decision to destroy myself that day . I was of course not indifferent towards the resolution , but my feeling was more one of pleasure at having found the final solution to my problem than one of commonplace fear . And , pleasure or fear , I marked it an indication of imperfect control to be so touched by my feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd decided was to be a quite usual day . " I thought I 'd take her down to see the showboat when it pulls in , " I said . " How 's her tonsils ? " " All right , I guess . Anyhow it was n't tonsillitis . Marvinp159came out and looked at her throat yesterday , and said it did n't look like he 'd have to take them out , unless we wanted him to go ahead and get it over with . It was her throat that was infected , and her tonsils just swelled up on general principles . I do n't know what Jane 's decided . Both of us had tonsillitis when we were kids . " " Better leave them in , " I suggested . " Mine used to swell up every now and then , whenever I had a sore throat , but it never amounted to anything . " Now there was a certain tactlessness in this remark , as I 'll explain presently , and I made it for that reason , with great nonchalance . Harrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critically . " I do n't know , " he said . " Marvin 's a little quick with the knife . Once when I was in law school and he was interning , he was all set to make a eunuch out of me . " Harrison replaced the cigar in his mouth and drew on it as we got up from the table . " That would 've been too bad , " he observed , and put a quarter down for the girl . Then he fetched his straw and mine , and we walked through the front of the store . Have I described Harrison ? Not being a writer by trade , I sometimesneglect these details . He was heavy-weighed perhaps two hundred pounds  --  and still well-built , though he showed slight signs of going to fat from lack of exercise . His features , which had been chiseled when I first knew him , had begun to round off a little , and his cheeks and belly no longer looked hard , as they had when he played much tennis and rode horses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , contrasting nicely with a complexion as much flushed as sunburned ( I daresay his blood pressure registered somewherebetween mine and Marvin 's ) , and his eyes , teeth , and arms were excellent . Very wealthy-looking fellow , Harrison , and very clean and handsome . The thin , consumptive corn/munist would justifiably loathe him , but the properly nourishedparlor communist would be made uncomfortable by his charm . I am sometimes afraid that those particular aspects of Harrison relevant to this story have made him look less engaging than he really was  --  I ca n't dwell on him , of course , for it 's not his story . Let me repeat , then , if I 've mentioned it before , that he was by no means either a fool or a weakling . He was a reasonable , generous , affable , alert fellow . I might even say that if this were a rational universe and if I could be any person I chose , I should not choose to be Todd Andrews at all . I should choose to be very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickle business , Todd ? " the Judge called to me as we stepped out on the sidewalk , where he spent much of his time watching the town . He referred , of course , to the disputed will , which case he had followed with great interest , he being an Orphan 's Court judge himself . " You gentlemen in the money yet ? " Ordinarily I 'd have enjoyed explaining the new developmentto him , for although he was not professionally trained , his mind was quick and sure , and he 'd have appreciated the maneuver . But of course I could not . " Nothing new , Judge , " I said loudly . " Depends on how the war goes , maybe . " " Well , I doubt it 'll go good for the Loyalists , " he declared . " They 've been holding their own lately , but it ca n't keep up . They 've got the Russians , but Mr. Franco , he 's got the Germansback of him , and like it or not , the German 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be dumb , but he 's dumb like a smart dog . Old Russian , he 's dumb like an ox . " Harrison was fidgeting to leave . For my part , I was interestedenough in the Judge 's prognostications , for though one might not care to accept his national characterizations ( he , by the way , was of German stock ) , his predictions werep161usually accurate , for he knew how to read newspapers , and read five or six a day . Special abilities like this are n't infrequentlyfound among intelligent , uneducated men , and where present they are often extremely reliable . It was , in fact , the Judge who had first predicted to me that Rollo Moore would n't be re-elected , and I 'd have gone ahead with my plans on the strength of his judgment even had I not been able to confirm it in certain Baltimore Republican circles . " You think Franco 's in , then ? " I asked . " I think it 'll take him a couple of years yet to wind it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole shebang might blow up . " Well , " Harrison fidgeted . I said goodbye to the Judge  --  after all , I probably would never see him again , and he was one of my favorite citizens  --  and walked with Harrison as far as his car , which was parked on Poplar Street . " Will you come for cocktails tonight ? " he asked as he slipped behind the wheel . I leaned down and talked to him through the window on my side . " Much obliged , " I said . Harrison put the Cadillac in gear . " Do n't feel obIigated , " he smiled ruefully . " Any time after four . " He slid away down the brick street , which shimmered now in the very hot sun . I walked toward the hotel for my nap , feeling fine about Harrison . There was no need for haste in making my decision , but the lunchtime had done his cause much good . Much good indeed.  |p162Climatologically  , this day of which I write was rare for DorchesterCounty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters that moderate the temperatures  --  the ocean , the Bay , the infinite estuaries , creeks , coves , guts , marshes , and inlets  --  also make them quite uncomfortable . This day , on the contrary , was excessively warm ( the temperatureas I walked to the hotel must have reached 95 ) , but extremely dry . I was wearing shirt , suit , underwear , and hat , and there was no shade on Poplar Street , but my body was as dry as a white bone in the desert , and I was entirely comfortable . It was a day when one would have liked to sit alone on a high dune by the ocean  --  the Atlantic beach is often just this dry , given a land breeze  --  in air as hot and salty as Earth 's commencement , the drought of precreation before the damp of procreation ; to sit a dried and salted sterile saint , Saint Todd of the Beach , and watch voracious gulls dissect the stranded carcasses of sandy skates and sharks , bleached and brined to stenchlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and mast-truck high in the High Street poplars , locusts rasped and whirred a parched dirge for my last high noon . It was a lovely day for suicide . Onep163felt that one would hardly bleed into such aridity ; more probably a knife in the neck would be kissed with a desiccant hiss of mere dry air . Turning the corner of Poplar , High , and Locust Streets , I found the loafer 's bench empty : the old men were doubtlesshome to nap . The Choptank sparkled at the foot of the boulevard . Adam 's Original &; Unparalleled FIoating Opera posters graced every business window on the empty streets from the Judge 's place to the hotel , red , white , and blue , as though the town had been set for Independence Day and then everyone  --  men , women , cats , and pallbearers  --  had gone to a parade somewhere else . The hotel lobby was light and cool ; a small chat with Jerry Hogey , and then I went to my room . Are you so curious as to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you are n't  --  if your sensitivity is such as to leave you in my room while I go ( I shall be only a minute ) , then read while you wait the story of my resumption of the affair with Jane Mack . Look back into Chapter III , and you 'll find that near the end of that chapter I reproduced an outline of the events that I imagined led up to my pleasant , if unnerving , seduction by the Macks . In the final section of that outline I listed what I considered to be the four possible courses that my relationship with them could take after I 'd broken it off by an act that , judged in the very terms that I objected to , they must regard as an insult . Now of these four courses , I must say that either I or IV ( that is , either permanent disaffection or the resumption of a qualified affection , one of the qualificationsbeing a suspension of the affair ) seemed the most probableto me after the incident in my office with Dorothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reckoning without two things , neitherof which I could reasonably have been expected to predict . In the first place , just a few weeks after the Macks hadsevered relations with me , Jane learned , upon being examinedp164by Marvin Rose for chronic nausea , that she was pregnant . Moreover , she was probably three months pregnant : it was possible for her not to guess it herself only because she . had always been irregular . As soon as Marvin looked at her , he said , " You 're pregnant , " and it instantly seemed so obvious to her ( she swore later that her tummy filled out the moment he spoke the word ) that she became a little hysterical at not having recognized it herself . Marvin gave her a sedative . Jane hurried home and could scarcely wait to tell Harrison when he came in from work , she was so delighted . But when he walked into the house and she opened her mouth to tell him , it suddenly occurred to her that she was three months pregnant , not three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into tears , and nearly fainted . When finally she was able to explain things to Harrison , he could n't say a word . The pregnancy was pretty miserable for both of them ( I learned all this later , of course ) . It would have been simple enough to arrange an abortion , of course , but it happened that they really wanted a child , and had tried unsuccessfully for several years to have one . They both wished , too late , that Jane had been more diligent in using precautions with me , but the fact was that she had n't ; it is a mark of Harrison 's saintliness that not once did he suggest a reproach for her carelessness , and a mark of Jane 's that she owned up to it in the first place . Being intelligent people , they were able to talk about the matter quite frankly , and they tried hard to articulate their sentiments , to decide just how they really felt about it . " Look at it this way , " Harrison 's most frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we sooner or later probablyadopt a kid ? Or suppose you 'd been married before and had a kid  --  would n't we still love it after you married me ? Now , this is better than adoption , because you 're going to be the real mother either way . And it 's better than a previousp165marriage , because there 's a good chance I 'm the real father . After all , I slept with you more than Andrews did . " As a matter of fact , that was a pretty good argument , I thought , but Harrison just never could put enough convictioninto his voice , and that last sentence , whether intended to do so or not , usually brought Jane to tears . " That 's all very true , " was her typical reply , " but no amount of reasoning can get around the fact that if I had n't made love to Todd in the first place  --  or if I 'd only kept my stupid head and been careful  --  then either I would n't be pregnant or we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her fine head in her hands , her excellent shoulders shaking . Harrison then , quite calmly ( but not kissing the sable hairor stroking the shoulders ) : " What the hell , hon , a fact 's a fact . There 's no use torturing yourself if you ca n't go back and start over . Do n't forget it was my idea as much as yours . We should n't have taken the step if we ca n't stand up to the consequences . " " But we did n't think of this ! " Jane would wail . And Harrison would shrug . " People get pregnant . " And so on . Oh , it was a lousy pregnancy . To make it worse , Jane was ill for most of the remaining six months ; whether physiological or psychosomatic , her nausea was serious . She could keep virtually nothing on her stomach , and on several occasions required uncomfortable glucose injections to stave off malnutrition . At the same time , though , her illness had the virtue of keeping her weight down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , from a short distance away , and she was so beautiful that I suffered a rare twinge of regret and real longing , no less intense for its being short-lived . And her moderate size eased her delivery : on October 2 , 1933 , in the Cambridge Memorial Hospital , after only three hours of labor , she gave birth to a six-pound ten-ounce girl , whom she named Jeannine Paulsen ( Jane 's maiden name ) Mack . Harrison and Jane had , understandably , been not a littlep166fearful of the day when they must actually bring their baby home ; when it would be committed totally into their hands and they would be expected to love and care for it . The care was no problem  --  there were bottles , formulas , and trained nurses  --  but they feared that the love might simply not be forthcoming , might not be in them . Jane especially feared this about Harrison , and Harrison about himself . But as it happened ( I shall be disappointed if you infer from this either a natural law or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she was an engaging child , luckily , right from her infancy  --  and found it quite easy to be normallyaffectionate parents . Perhaps their knowledge of the very danger of any other reaction sufficed to open the buds of love in their hearts . They breathed much more easily ( the baby , obviously doing her best to protect her own interests , contrived to resemble neither Harrison nor me to any embarrassingdegree ) and wondered what they 'd worried so much about . " I swear , " Harrison volunteered , " if somebody should prove to me , right this minute , that Todd was Jeannine 's father , I would n't love her a bit less for it . " " Oh , I 'm sure he 's not , " Jane scoffed ( you understand that I heard all this later ) . " But I do n't think I would , either . She 's beautiful . " But the important statement , for this story , Harrison made sometime in the spring of 1934 , about a year after I 'd insulted them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may not agree with this , because I know how much you dislike him , but I sometimes think that that business with Todd was partly our fault , too . " " Our fault ! " " I mean , what the hell , we put him on the spot , when you got in bed with him ; he might not even have wanted to , you know  --  not because he did n't want you , but because he might have thought it would hurt our marriage . But if he 'd refused ,  |p167we  'd have been insulted , would n't we ? And , in fact , if he had n't done it on our terms , we 'd have been insulted , I think . " " Still , he had no business telling us he was a virgin , " Jane insisted . " But you ca n't deny we were pleased when he did , " Harrisonreplied . " That proves we were expecting too much of him . And we certainly had no right to expect him not to make love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bachelor . " " Yes , but he was supposed to be in love with me . " " You 're in love with me , too , " Harrison smiled , " but you made love to Toddy . You understand . " Jane sulked . " We just plain expected too much . We should 've known him better . We knew he gets foul moods on and likes to hurt people . " ( I do n't entirely agree , by the way . ) " Well maybe you 're right , " Jane said . " But he certainly had no right to break it off like he did , with that damned colored girl ! " Harrison grinned . " I guess he 's just unprejudiced . To tell the truth , the more I think about that , the more I believe he was just ad-libbing . That girl did n't know what was up any more than I did . " Jane grew exasperated . " You take up for him all you want to , " she declared . " He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Whoa , now , " Harrison reminded her gently . " Well , you ca n't tell me he could n't have just told us what was on his mind , without going out of his way to hurt us . " " I think two things about that , " Harrison said calmly . " In the first place I 'm not sure we would n't have been just as insulted no matter how he did it . What the hell , we wanted him to declare love for us , and he just did n't have it . We 'd gone out on a limb . "  | " With his encouragement , " Jane added sarcastically . " Do n't forget the virgin and love stuff . " " That 's the second thing . No matter how much we think of Toddy , or thought of him , he just is n't a saint , that 's all . I think he said those things because he thought we expected them  --  and we did , God damn it  --  and I think when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did either through cowardice or on account of his mean streak . What the hell , it might just be his mean streak . " Well , Jane sulked for a while , but after the ice had been broken they talked more freely about me , and less bitterly . Gradually it got to be assumed that they 'd really been too demanding ( a piece of objectivity that still appalls me ) , and that to some extent I 'd been justified in showing my claws . The next step was for Jane to say , " Hell , I forgive him ; I just do n't want anything to do with him any more . I do n't want to get hurt again . " And for Harrison to say , " I still like Todd all right ; it 's just that I ca n't get enthusiastic about seeing him any more . I do n't bear him any grudge . " Jeannine grew and grew , and discreetly began to look like her mother . The second thing that I had n't predicted was that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving seventeen testamentary instruments for his wife , son , and nurses to play games with . But that he did , just as surely as sweet Janie got herself impregnated , and just as irremediably . No one needed to suggest to Harrison that he needed professionalassistance , either ; he consulted a lawyer a lot more quickly than Jane had consulted a physician , and the firm that he retained was Andrews , Bishop , &; Andrews . The obvious necessity for legal counsel , the disturbance over his father 's death , the excitement over the big estate  --  all these made his move seem quite natural , so that if there was anything in it of a deliberate overt act to reinstate our friend/ship , the overtness was effectively camouflaged , and one need n't even think of it . There were , one can well imagine , dozens of details in the litigation that required discussion , strategies to be worked out , conferences to be held : many more than could be convenientlyfitted into my rather leisurely office schedule . It was inevitable , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours for the purpose ; even that he should eventually invite me , with admirable aplomb , to come for late cocktails one evening , and that I , with commensurate grace , should accept . Of that evening  --  at first somewhat strained , since it was my first meeting with Jane in more than two years  --  just one incident will do here : the Macks had put Jeannine to bed early , thinking thereby to keep discomfort at a minimum , and with the assistance of Gilbey 's gin and Sherbrook rye , the three of us had contrived to reach a condition of mellow , if tacit , mutual forgiveness . We all felt relieved that the nonsenseof the past two years was done , though nothing was said about it directly ; our good spirits were reflected in the unusual amount of liquor consumed , in the fact that whateverlegal matters had provided the excuse for our meeting never got discussed , and ( most significantly ) by the fact that when Jeannine , who had a slight cold , began to fret in her crib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said spontaneously : " Come on , Toddy , you have n't met this little Mack ! Come upstairs with me and be introduced . " She realized her slip as soon as it was out , and added at once , without changing her tone or expression , " Harrison will do the honors , wo n't you , honey ? " The three of us went to the nursery , where Jeannine  --  a blond little charmer whom I must say I 'd be delighted to learn I 'd fathered  --  stood up sleepily in her crib and grinned at her parents , shyly , because I was there.  | " Jeannine , " Harrison said , " this is Toddy . Can you say Toddy ? " Jeannine could not , or would not . " Would you like to kiss Toddy good night , honey ? " Jane asked her . Jeannine hung her head , but looked up at me from under her eyebrows and chortled . When I kissed her hair  --  as soft as silk thread , and fragrant with baby soap  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the blanket . Jane had crossed the room to adjust the window , and Harrisonand I stood side by side at the crib , where Jeannine was already on the verge of sleep . A number of very obvious thoughts were in the air of the nursery  --  it was like a scene arranged by a heavy-handed Hollywood director  --  and I , for one , was terribly embarrassed when Jane , after her excellent and immediate good taste of a few minutes before , now came up behind us and simply grasped both our arms tightly while we looked at the little girl . Our little girl , the whole tableau simpered , underlining the pronoun , and it does n't matter which of you is the father , for she was conceived in the sweetness of all our love . Ah , reader , the thing was so gross , so sentimental ; and yet I was moved , in my uncomfortable fashion , for with the Macks these sentiments are always thoroughly sincere . They are simply full of love , for themselves , for each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Harrison , sensitive by then to such solemnities , at once poured a round of inordinatelyalcoholic cocktails and we were soon gay again , like kids after communion  --  we were restored to grace . The evening was a success ; I returned often ; and soon , but for the two quiet years that sometimes hung heavy over our conversation , we spoke together as freely and easily as ever . I will say honestly that had the friendship remained at exactly this stage of reconstruction , I should have asked for nothing more . I was content to see the Macks outgrow theirp171earlier unbecoming and immature jealousy , which was as essentially dangerous to their own relationship as it was inconsistentwith their previous behavior . Nor did I see how things could tactfully become any more intimate , after my rebuff of 1933 . But on the night of July 31 , 1935 , while I was sitting at my window reading a book for my Inquiry ( somebody'scritique of Adam Smith 's economics , I do believe ) , there was a small knock on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wearing shorts . " Hi , " she said , standing just inside the closed door . " Hello , " I answered . I closed my book , threw my cigar stub out the window , and got up to give her the chair . " Sit down . " " All right . " She grinned quickly and came over to the window , where I was sitting on the sill , but she forgot to sit down . I did n't want any nonsense this time  --  for her sake , not because I objected to nonsense on principle  --  and so I kept my eyes on her face , not to make it any easier for her . She mostly looked down at the street . " We 've been for a boat ride , " she said . When I did n't answer , she looked at me irritably and began to fidget . " I 'm not going to grab you , Janie , " I said , " or send you away either . " " You have to understand everything at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about anything just now . " " That 's impossible , " I said honestly . " I can understand everything at once in about three different ways . " " You 're not helping me . You 're not saying any of the right things . " She laughed . I did n't smile . " That 's only because I do n't know what you want to hear , Jane . You should know I 'll say anything I think you want to hear . " Her smile disappeared , and she regarded the dark Post Office across the street and fiddled with the curtain pull . " That was a hard lesson , Toddy . "  | " I was n't teaching anybody anything , " I said sharply . " What the hell do you think I am ? I was just getting clear . I was concerned only with myself in that thing . Listen , " I said , " do n't fool yourself about me . You know how much I like you and Harrison  --  it 's a lot , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how far it goes , and what things it does n't include for anybody . " She said nothing , just fiddled with the cord . " Let me ask you , " I said . " Do I love you ? " " No . " " Now damn it , let 's get that straight . I do n't want to hurt you all . " " You do n't love me and I do n't love you . " This was getting as theatrical as the other . I gave it up . For ten minutes more Jane stared at the Post Office . I honestly could n't guess what would come of it . After a few minutes , though I did n't intend any such thing , my mind  --  never very impressed by this sort of dramatics  --  actually wanderedto other things : to the seventeen wills , to Bill Froebel , to the critique of Adam Smith . And it startled me , for I 'd honestly forgotten for an instant that she was there , when Jane spun around from the window and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Right now . " Without looking at me , she walked to the bed , unfastened her shorts and halter , and lay down , and very shortly after that I joined her . So . Nothing remains to be told of the affair , except that after its resumption it was conducted in a manner much more satisfactory to me . No schedules , no demands , no jealousy , no fictions  --  all was spontaneity and candor . I think that my increasingly frequent impotency after that time ( by 1936 , about every fourth attempt at intercourse was a failure ; by 1937 , about every other attempt ) would have led me to call off the thing for good in time anyway , even had I not resolved on this day to kill myself . But by 1937 I could contemplatep173with equanimity the prospect of terminating our affair , for it left , from my point of view , nothing to be desired . Jane Mack is the finest woman I 've ever slept with . Literally , I repeat , she left nothing to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the day at hand , when she last left my rented bed , I have desired nothing from women . She satisfied me . Now , if you 'll excuse me , I shall sleep.  |p174Although  it was my custom to nap for at least an hour every day , on the day I intended to be my last I was waked almost as soon as my eyes were closed , by an urgent knock on my door . " Come on in , " I called , and pulled a bathrobe on over my underwear . There was no response for several moments , and I had begun to decide that my unknown caller had gone away , when I heard two or three footsteps in the hall and then another knock . " Yes , come on in , " I repeated , still tying my robe . Another pause . I started toward the door , but it opened just before I reached it , and Mr. Haecker , taut as a piano wire , stepped stiffly inside . " Sit down , Mr. Haecker ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His smile was thin and broken like the smiles of army recruits hearing heavy artillery for the first time , and his face was white . I took his arm firmly and led him to the chair . " Let me get you a drop of rye , Mr. Haecker . " My first thought was that the old fellow was ill and had come to me for help.  | " No thank you , Todd , " he managed to say . His voice I can describe only as a prim croak , if that makes sense at all . He perched on the edge of the chair as daintily as a canary on its swing , and his hands clutched his knees tightly for support . " Is anything wrong , sir ? " I asked . He looked a bit better now , but still none too stable . " No , " he said shortly , closing his eyes and shaking his head slightly . " No . I just  --  came in to talk to you , Todd . " He looked directly at me then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sick smile . I can recall smiling at my father in just that way once at some amusement park  --  Tolchester , perhaps  --  when he put me on a carousel much too large , loud , and rapid for my tastes , and expected me to enjoy it as everyone else did . " Are you busy ? " " Busy loafing , " I said , and sat on the edge of the bed . " What 's on your mind , sir ? " I offered him a cigarette , which he refused with a quick shake of his head , and then I lit one myself for a change . " I daresay you 'll think me very foolish , son , " he began , in a tone that I at once recognized as false  --  an unnaturally deep , head-of-the-clan tone . " A garrulous old man , like many an-other . " " Not unless what you say is foolish , " I said flatly , for his pose annoyed me . Mr. Haecker blushed  --  a surprising thing in a man seventynineyears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed nervously . " You do n't talk nonsense as a rule , " I smiled . Mr. Haecker sighed , but his sigh was not spontaneous as his blush had been . And he glanced at me sharply . " It 's a not uncommon thing for quite old men  --  men my age  --  to lose their perspective , " he observed judiciously . " I 'm quite aware of that fact , and I often wonder whether we are always being fair when we call it simply senility . " He paused , but I said nothing : I was waiting for him to finish tuning his piano.  | " What I mean is , there are conditions of most people 's old age , other than mental failure , that could lead to the same crankiness , if you like . Disease , for example , or poverty , or isolation . Do n't you think ? " " It certainly sounds reasonable to me , " I agreed mildly . Mr. Haecker looked relieved . " Now , then , " he said , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He clenched his lean fists on his knees and stared at them . " You must tell me quite frankly  --  I think you 'll be honest with me  --  did you think the things I told Captain Osborn this morning were entirely silly ? You said you did n't agree with me , I remember . " To myself I said " Ah , " and regarded my visitor 's face more carefully , for the first note on the piano had been sounded . To him I said , " This morning ? Oh , you mean the growing old ' business . " I 'd hoped his question was merely rhetorical , an attempt to get himself going ; but apparently he expected an answer , for he remained silent , a distracted look on his really quite distinguished face . " Well , yes and no , " I answered . " If the idea you 're referringto is the one I 'm thinking of , that old age is the glorious finale of life  --  the last of life for which the first was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's possible that Cicero was n't just whistling in the graveyard . After all , with no church to stop him , a good Roman fell on his sword when things got too miserable ; Cicero , remember , was famous and pretty well off in his old age , and probably got a toot out of being a public figure . " " I believe he deeply loved life , " Mr. Haecker remarked in another false tone , a ministerial one delivered with chin thrust out and head nodding gravely . " Every stage of it for its own peculiar virtues . " " And I think the notion probably works for a good number of people who are either devoutly religious and actually be/lieve in a blessed hereafter , or who are honestly content with their careers , or who are temperamentally stoical . " " I quite agree , " Mr. Haecker said . " But you said yes and no . " That 's right .

" Mr. Haecker clucked his tongue . " And what about me ? I quite respect your opinion , Todd , as you should know . I 've often wished I were your age "  --  he smiled ruefully  --  " or you were mine , so we could discuss things more freely . Intellectualdiscussion , after all , is the real joy of the winter of life , when other pleasures have flown , as it were . " I spoke as gently as I could without defeating my purpose . " If I were used to feeling pity for people , " I said , " I think I 'd feel sorrier for you than for anyone in this hotel , sir . " Mr. Haecker 's eyes grew panicky  --  their first really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't assault me when I say this , " I smiled . " I 'm not by any means the truth-at-any-price sort , I swear . But since you asked , I 'll admit I consider your position the least enviable of anyone 's in the Explorers ' Club . Miss Holiday Hopkinson has been ready to die for so long , with her daily vitamins and crossed hands , that when death actually gets to her it 'll be an anticlimax . That could lead to hysteria , like the kid who studies diving from books all winter and then gets out on the high board and forgets everything he learned , but probably it wo n't . She 'll die in her sleep , I 'll bet . And Cap'n Osborn has known how he honestly feels about it too , for a long time , whenever he bothers to think about it , which is damned seldom . He 'll just put up a whale of a holler and tussle whenp178the time comes . But the trouble with you , sir , if I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're enjoying yourself and looking forward to death as a grand finale , when actually you 're not . " " Oh , that 's not so ! " Mr. Haecker protested . " There 's nothing wrong with fooling yourself , " I said soothingly . " Lots of times it 's that or the insane asylum . But it just does n't work if it does n't work . The whole trouble is that you 're not fooling yourself , as maybe Cap'n Osborn is ; you 're just trying to fool yourself , and you know very well it 's all an act . What the hell 's glorious about your old age ? What 's wrong with facing the fact that things are pretty bleak , and complaining like hell about it ? " When Mr. Haecker slipped anger onto his face then , I began to weary of the colloquy and wish I were alone . Had he been sincerely angry I 'd not have objected , but his anger was another in his wardrobe of masks . " You 're being quite frank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said anything , then . " I sighed , and stretched out on the bed in my robe and slippers . " All 's for the best in the best of all possible worlds . " " I 'm not angry at your impertinence , " he went on , " but I must say I 'm disappointed in your values . They 're pretty commonplace , for you . " I said nothing , and wished I 'd said nothing from the beginning . After all , he was seventy-nine ; even with his excellenthealth , he could n't be expected to live much more than ten short years , and it was no special concern of mine whether he enjoyed them or not . " Of course my career in the public schools was n't spectacular , if you judge it purely by promotions and the like , " he pouted . " And I sha n't deny that I 'd be happier if my wife were alive , or if we 'd had children  --  " He was watching himselfbeing strong . He even paused before continuing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we did n't . Do you want me to gop179around in mourning , begging for pity ? My friend Cicero has something to say about that , too : In times like these , theirs is far from being the worst fate to whom it has been given to exchange life for a painless death . ' And this : If she had not died now , she would yet have had to die a few years hence , for she was mortal born . ' What has happened has happened . " Was there any reason to bother pointing out to him how directly his first quotation contradicted his whole position ? I flipped my cigarette out the open window . " Of all my acquaintances , " Mr. Haecker went on determinedly , " I 'd have expected you to be the first to recognize the happiness a mature man can get from a solitary old age , if he does n't act childish about it . After all the hustle and bustle , one is finally able to live in the company of his thoughts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that what all the philosophers wanted ? I can understand Captain Osborn not realizing it ; good a chap as he is , the poor fellow has n't had the opportunity to educate himself . But you certainly must be aware that the life of solitary contemplationis the best  --  after all , you 're alone , too . " " I do precious little contemplating , " I said . " And if I wanted to , I could chuck the whole thing tomorrow and get married . The point is , I 'm here by choice . Also , I ca n't quote you the lines , " I added , " but your pal Cicero was n't so enthusiastic about the contemplative life . He said somewherethat if a man could ascend into heaven all by himself and see the workings of the universe and so forth , the sight would n't give him much pleasure ; but it would be the finest thing in the world if he had somebody to describe it to . I 'm not saying I believe any of this nonsense  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're changing texts every few minutes . " Another mask : Mr. Haecker got up from the chair and assumed an injured tone . " I see I 'm keeping you from your nap , " he said . " It took some courage for one my age to dis/cuss these things with a young man . I thought you 'd be interested in them , though . " " You 're begging the question with that attitude , " I said , sitting up . " If there was any question . You asked me how I felt about it . " " Well how do you feel ? " he cried vehemently . " What do you want a man to do who does n't have anything to live for ? It 's either pretend to be content , like a man , or go around wailing and weeping like a child . " " I do n't care what anyone does , " I said . " It makes no difference to me , on principle , whether you 're happy or not . I 'm no humanitarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't want to be in your shoes . But I do n't agree that the two alternatives you just mentioned are the only ones . " " What else is there ? " Mr. Haecker cried . He was getting quite worked up again , and his eyes , honest now , showed despair through any mask he donned . " Maybe you recommendsuicide ? " He laughed explosively . " Is that the other alternative ? " " It was for Cicero 's crowd , " I said . " Let me tell you something . Unless a man subscribes to some religion that does n't allow it , then the question of whether or not to commit suicideis the very first question he has to answer before he can work things out for himself . This applies only to people who want to live rationally , of course  --  who want to work out an ethics for themselves . Most people never realize that there is such a problem in the first place , and I do n't see any particularreason why they should have it pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked me . " " Well , I 'm not a religious man , " Mr. Haecker declared , " but I think that 's reason enough not to kill myself . If death is the absolute end , then you 're better off alive under any circumstances . " " That does n't follow . If death is the end , then it 's neutral . Which is better , to be unhappy or to be neutral ? It wouldp181be different if you could look forward to something better in the near future . I would n't commit suicide , for instance , just because the Yankees lost a ball game . " Mr. Haecker stood rigid and pale , refusing to be entertained by my remark . " You advise me to kill myself , " he said stiffly . " Not at all . I did n't say everybody should work out a rationale . But if you do , then you must answer the suicide question for yourself before you start , obviously . If you want to make sense , then I 've learned that you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've used the word if . " " Then if I want to live rationally , I should kill myself ? " he asked , his voice a thin laugh . " You should only think about the question , " I repeated . " Hamlet 's question , whether ' t is better in the mind to suffer ... " " Of course , Hamlet was either insane or pretending to be , " Mr. Haecker remembered triumphantly . " You 're evading the question , " I said . " How about you ? " he snickered . " Have you thought about it ? I see you 're still alive . Why is that ? " I smiled . " I promise I 'll think about it after supper tonight , and let you know tomorrow what I decide . You do the same , and we 'll compare notes and chip in for either a box of cigars or a pistol , as the case may be . Okay ? But do n't forget , " I added seriously , " to consider every objection to suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill yourself , you can always change your mind later , but the other decision is hard to correct . " Again Mr. Haecker refused to be entertained . " It 's a question of values , " he observed , " and life itself has a value , under any circumstances . There is an absolute value to human life that wo n't be denied . " " I deny it , " I said . " There 's no reason why you shouldn'tp182believe that , but you ca n't prove it . If you want to accept it on faith , okay , but then there 's no argument . " Mr. Haecker smiled grimly and went to the door . His eyes were still honest ; he could do nothing with the fear in them , although he covered the rest of his features with a visionary falseface when he turned at the door and said , " Life , the simple fact of life , is good , young man . Life has an intrinsic value . " I was licking a cigar . " Nothing has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though I 'd known it for years , when in fact that fundamentalnotion had just occurred to me , between licks . Mr. Haecker closed the door , and I wondered why he 'd come to see me ; what exactly he 'd had on his mind . If it had been some sort of confession , my reaction had driven him behind his masks . No matter : if now in protest against my ideas he actually began to believe his own , that was no concern of mine.  |p183Quantitative  changes suddenly become qualitative changes . From all of Marxism , which I once thought attractive enough , I find only this dictum remaining in the realm of my opinions . Water grows colder and colder and colder , and suddenly it 's ice . The day grows darker and darker , and suddenly it 's night . Man ages and ages , and suddenly he 's dead . Quantitative changes suddenly become qualitative changes ; differences in degree lead to differences in kind . When Mr. Haecker had gone ( Where ? Up to his room , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I donned my trousers , shirt , coat , and straw , and walked back through the great dry heat to the office . The sky was brilliant blue , the water likewise  --  a darker shade . Everythingwas still : only a few cars moved along High Street ; no boats were visible on the river ; the flag at Long Wharf hung limply against its staff . Everything was baking in the enormousheat , which nevertheless drew not a bead of perspiration from my skin . What was on my mind , as I walked , was this grand proposition that had occurred to me while I was licking my cigar : that nothing , absolutely nothing , has any intrinsic value.  |p184Now  that the idea was articulated in my head , it seemed to me ridiculous that I had n't seen it years ago . It seemed to me that all my life I 'd been deciding that specific things had no intrinsic value  --  that things like money , honesty , strength , love , information , wisdom , even life , are not valuable in themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd never considered generalizing from those specific instances , had never looked beyond whatever single tree happened to be before my eyes . But again : one instance was added to another , and another to that , and suddenly the total realization was effected  --  nothing is intrinsically valuable ; the value of everything is attributed to it , assigned to it , from outside the thing itself , by people . In my tranquil way , I must confess to feeling some real excitement at the idea . Need I repeat that I am not a thinker ? That technical philosophy is not my cup of tea ? Doubtless ( as I later learned ) this idea was not original with me , but it was completely new to me , and I delighted in it like a child turned loose for the first time in the endless out-of-doors , full of scornful pity for those still inside . Nothing is valuable in itself . Not even truth ; not even this truth . I am not a philosopher , except after the fact ; but I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon my consciousness , has , as it were , grabbed me by the throat and forced me into a new position , once there has been in my world a sufficient accumulation of quantitative change to effect in my attitudes toward it a qualitative change , then I can philosophize ( or rationalize ) like two Kants , like seven Philadelphia lawyers . In short , beginning with my new conclusions , I can work out magnificent premises . On this morning , for example , I had opened my eyes with the knowledge that this day would be my last ; that I would this day destroy myself ( a conclusion in itself demonstrating Marx 's dictum ) ; here the day was but half spent , and already premises were springing to my mind , to justify on philosophi/cal grounds what had been a purely personal decision . The argument was staggering . Enough now to establish this first premise : nothing is intrinsically valuable ; the values that things are said to have  --  good or bad or whatever  --  are attributed to them by people . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good comfortable time to swallow that proposition  --  I daresay it will stick in not a few throats . Consider it , and its ramifications . If you can stomach it , why then you 've done quite enough for one chapter , and so have I.p186As you doubtless decided long ago yourself , not only am I not a philosopher ; I 'm not a prose stylist , either . At best , my prose is a plodding , graceless thing : I 've no comprehension of stylistic tricks , nor can I stick to the straight highway of the plot , when there 's half a world on either side . Just now , for example , it 's time for me to tell you about my brief afternoon 's activities in my office  --  which to many people will seem altogether irrelevant to the story in the first place , though I ca n't be expected to agree  --  and I find myself faced with the necessity of introducing this chapter twice . How is it to be done ? My first thought is to deliver the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read with the left one to be read with the lefteye , and one with the right , eye , and one with the right , so ; but I daresay the more so ; but I daresay the morecrochety among you would crochety among you wouldbe annoyed by such an un- he annoyed by such an unorthodoxexpedient. orthodox expedient . My second thought is to deliver them consecutively , or else by recourse to interlineation ; but it occurs to me that no matter how the thing is done , I sha n't escape the recklessp18charge of disorganization from those who would prefer our world to be a rational one , in which single chapters have single introductions and all chapters are relevant . And it is , without question , those people , among others , whom I 'm trying to please as much as is convenient . For one thing , I have more to say about Prince Hamlet . You 'll recall that chapter before last I declared to Mr. Haecker that anyone who wishes to order his life in terms of a rationale  --  anyone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all answer for himself Hamlet 's question , the question of suicide . I would add further that if he wants my respect , his choice to live must be based on firmer ground than Hamlet 's  --  that " conscience does make cowards of us all " : that to choose suicide is to choose unknown evils for known ones . This position ( quite like Montaigne 's argument against revolution and reform ) is , as the Prince admits , simply cowardly , not reasonable . On the other hand , if one chooses to die , for mercy 's sake let this choice be more reasonably founded than Hamlet 's , too  --  merely escaping the " slings and arrows of outrageous fortune " is as cowardly as is fearing dreams beyond the grave . Do n't think I 'm an indiscriminatingpromoter of suicides ; such an oversimplificationmakes objections too easy . I merely hold that those who would live reasonably should have reasons for remaining alive or else kill themselves . This , I think , is reasonable enough ? But I can not accept bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's . Indeed , it was the absence , in my opinion , of any valid reason for his hanging himself that turned me quite suddenly into a cynic after his death , though I had , of course , the seeds of cynicism in me all along . It was a sudden qualitative change , the impingementof the world onto my philosophy . I 'll say more presentlyabout my reaction to Dad 's death , and about the charming little adventure that followed it , but I want first to review very briefly the case on which I spent my afternoonp188hour 's work  --  what I meant to be my final hour 's work as a lawyer . It will serve as an introduction to Col. Henry Morton , who plays a role in the little adventure , and at the same time keep you from assuming that I simply loafed all afternoon . When I re-entered my office ( this is the second introduction ) , the clock in the tower of the Municipal Building was just striking two , and as if by a prearranged signal , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came whistling in off the river : Adam 's Original &; Unparalleled Floating Opera , one could guess , had just passed Hambrooks Bar Light and was heading up the channel to the bell buoy and thence to Long Wharf . For the thousandth time I blushed at the clumsy ironies of coincidence , for it happened that just as I drew from my files the nearly completed brief of a litigation involving a slight injury to the left foot of perhaps the richest man in Cambridge  --  who stood to be some fifteen thousand dollars richer if my client lost the case  --  the calliope broke into " Oh , Dem Golden Slippers , " and a few minutes later , when I was reflecting on the difficulties my client would have in scraping together that sum , the melody changed to " What You Gon ' Do When De Rent Comes ' Round ? " In fact , even to think of the name Adam 's Original &; Unparalleled Floating Opera  --  its completely unsubtle significance  --  whenI had before me the extraordinary case of Morton v. Butler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist such an unparalleled floating opera as the law in its less efficient moments , and seldom had the law such inefficient moments as those during which it involved itself  --  nay , diffused , dissipated , lost itself  --  in Morton v. Butler . Hamlet listed " the law 's delay " as one of the things that could drive a man to suicide . That I do n't accept the Prince 's list , you 've already observed ; that neither Morton nor Butler accepted this particular annoyance as suicidal is evidenced by their both still walking the earth . Let me review the case very briefly . If you are incapable of discerning in it anyp189greater relevance , simply regard it as a curious bump on the knotty log of my story : Morton v. Butler , by June of 1937 , was already a litigation almost six years old , and at the time of this story the litigants had n't yet even begun to try the case on its merits , but were still enmeshed , via their attorneys , in procedural disputes . Col. Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with his wife , was the plaintiff , and was represented by Charley Parks , my neighbor and poker partner . I represented the defendant , Mr. William T. Butler , a wealthy investment broker who happened to run the NewDealwing of the local Democratic machine , the other , conservative , wing of which was run by Col. Morton . What happened was quite simple . On October 31 , 1931 , Mr. Butler was driving his Cadillac sedan down Court Lane , just outside my office , and Col. Morton 's only son , Allan ( for whom the Colonel had a great , if overprotective , affection ) , was driving his Cadillac sedan down Gay Street , which meets Court Lane at the creek . Col. and Mrs. Morton were passengers in their son 's car . The two cars met at the bottom of the hill . Butler had to make a right turn up Gay Street , and young Morton a left turn up Court Lane . Both drivers signaled their turns , and each saw the other 's signal . Then ( from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simultaneously , Butler turning too wide and Allan Morton too short . The automobiles collided , and both were damaged slightly . Also , Mrs. Morton broke her spectacles and scratched her face on the lenses , and the Colonel wrenched the tendons of his left foot rather severely . The drivers got out ; Butler and the limping Colonel shook hands , as rival candidates for the same office might . " Well , Bill ! " the Colonel bellowed heartily . " Ca n't you drive that machine ? " " Not on the same street with that boy of yours ! " Butler guffawed back . The two men chortled and chuckled , slappedp190each other on the shoulders , and then parted , having tacitly agreed that the injuries did n't seem serious , and that among responsible gentlemen such private affairs did n't go to court . Next day , Butler sent Mrs. Morton a fifteen-dollar spray of mixed flowers , and the Colonel sent Butler a quart of Haig &; Haig . Had it not been for Franklin Roosevelt , the affair might have ended there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deal just afterwards , and in the summer of 1933 actually sailed up the Choptank to Cambridge , to dedicate the just-completed Harrington Bridge across that river . Both factions of the party were feverishly enthusiastic : when it was announced that the President would not come ashore , but would broadcast his dedication from the presidentialyacht Potomac , anchored out by the bell buoy , Col. Morton took it upon himself to have razed the old freight house that stood on Long Wharf , declaring it to be a natural place of concealment for assassins with high-powered rifles . The city council nodded , and the old structure came down . The Colonel then declared that no private vessels should be permitted to leave the creek or the yacht basin while the Potomac was at anchor  --  the scene otherwise would be disrespectfullycluttered . The mayor made such a resolution , and the yacht club followed suit . Surely a magnanimous solicitude for an anti-New-Dealer ! But of the citizens of Cambridge , thousands of whom respectfully lined the bulkheadsto see the Potomac and listen to the President 's amplifiedvoice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Butler , of the Butler Democrats . One month later , for no stated reason , Mr. Butler dropped into my office and described to me his automobile accident of nearly two years before . " I 'll want you to handle it if anything comes up , honey , " he chuckled ( it was his habit always to speak with a chuckle , whether the thing he said was funny or not ) .  |p191And  not long after that ( it was , in fact , on October 13 , 1933 , just two weeks before the statute of limitations would have run out ) , Charley Parks called me to say that he was filing suit against Butler for Col. and Mrs. Morton , who claimed personal injuries , and for Allan Morton , who claimed damages of $75.00 for repairs to and $600 for alleged depreciationin the value of his Cadillac . The injury claims of the Colonel and his wife totaled nearly $15,000 : their hospital and medical expenses amounted to a total of $854.26 , and in addition they claimed $14,000 for pain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mental anguish ( resulting from Evelyn Morton 's permanent , if faint , disfigurement and the Colonel 's perpetual limp ) . I guessed at once that even had Mr. Roosevelt remained in Washington , Butler 's retaining me as his counsel would have been sufficient reason for the Colonel to decide , belatedly , to press the case , for as you shall see directly , between the Mortons and myself there was small love lost . I worked out my strategy at once . Now , although Charley and I have on occasion enjoyed long sessions of legal hair-splitting over beer and seven-card stud , at no time did we ever say in so many words that we were making game out of Morton v. Butler . Nevertheless , here is what happened in the remaining two months of 1933 : On November 20 , the three plaintiffs filed their official complaint , charging that the collision had been due to Butler 's negligence in that he took the corner at an excessive rate of speed ; that he failed to have his car under proper and adequatecontrol ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omission . On December 15 , I filed for Butler a petition for severance of Allan Morton 's action from that of the other plaintiffs . On December 29 , the Circuit Court dismissed the petition . I went to Butler 's New Year 's Eve party and drank sloe gin. 1934 : On January 9 , I filed a petition to set aside the court order of December 29 , which had dismissed my originalp192petition . On April 26 the court set aside that order and granted the severance we wanted . Then , on May 4 , I obtaineda writ to join Allan Morton as an additional defendant , along with Butler , in the severed suit of Col. and Mrs. Morton , and filed a complaint against him  --  substantially identical to his complaint against Butler . On June 18 , Charley Parks answered for Allan , pleading in new matter the statute of limitations , which of course had run out nearly eight months ago . On August 8 , Butler replied to the new matter . On October 26 , Charley filed a motion , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relative to Butler 's complaint . On December 29 , exactly a year since the dismissalof my original petition for severance , the court dismissedmy complaint against young Morton , and on New Year 's Eve , far from committing suicide ( as Hamlet would have done by this time ) , I got drunk at Butler 's party , on vodka sours. 1935 : On January 10 ( while Harrison Mack , Sr. , by the way , was dying in his bed in Ruxton ) , I petitioned for permission to file an amended complaint for Butler . On January 18 , the court granted its permission , and I filed an amended complaint against Allan Morton , averring that his parents , in their complaint against Butler , had charged that their $15,000 injuries were due solely to Butler 's negligence ; that Butler was prepared to serve a copy of that very complaint against their son ; that Butler admitted neither in whole nor in part their charges ; that Allan had been negligent in the operation of his Cadillac ; that only the actual trial would determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major contributing cause of the accident , but that it was one or the other ; that Butler desired to be able to protect his right of contribution in the event the court found him to have been jointly or concurrently negligent with Allan ; and that therefore Allan was jointly liable with Butler upon the causes of action declared upon by Col. andp193Mrs . Morton . On February 6 , Allan  --  or rather , Charley  --  filed his answer along with new matter again pleading the statute of limitations . On April 8 , the court , while not ruling on the accuracy of Butler 's charges , dismissed my amended complaint on five grounds , all as sensible and exceptionable as are the grounds for any such ruling . Charley and I played poker a few times in March and April , and then on May 1 a stipulation of counsel was filed , agreeing to my filing a second amended complaint for Butler against Allan , and I filed the new complaint , a document differing from its predecessorsonly in its rhetoric . On May 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as before . On October 21 , the court dismissed the second amended complaint on the same grounds as before , and on November 12 entered orders in each of the two cases separately to the same effect . By this time I was well enmeshed in the Mack will case , but nevertheless , as Charley grinned and Butler chuckled , I took the Circuit Court 's order to the Court of Appeals on November 13 . That New Year 's Eve I drank Sherbrook rye , first with the Macks in their club cellar , then with Butler in his club cellar , and finally with Jane in my room , but did not get drunk. 1936 : The Mack will case was now involved in its own glorious intricacies , but I found time on March 17 to argue in the Maryland Court of Appeals for reversal of the CircuitCourt 's order . The question , for both courts , was whether , since the statute of limitations prevented our joiningyoung Morton as an additional defendant on grounds of sole liability , we had averred in our amended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concurrent liability , and the Court of Appeals agreed ( on December 4 ) that we did not . But they quite reasonably allowed me to appeal to the Maryland Supreme Court their affirmation of the CircuitCourt 's order , so that the procedural question might bep194finally determined . That New Year 's Eve , as I recall , I drank alone in my room. 1937 : Now I had never agreed with the two lower courts that what they thought was the question was really the question . And so , on April 26 , I argued to the Supreme Court that the real issue was whether a defendant in a tort action who , like Butler , was barred by the statute of limitations from joining an additional defendant ( to whom he was also liable , you see ) on the grounds of sole liability , might yet preserve his right of contribution by pleading joint or several liability without alleging facts admitting his own liability to the plaintiff ( Col. and Mrs. Morton ) . My position was that if Butler , in order to establish Allan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averring facts showing Allan 's negligence , to admit his own negligence , it amounted to denying Butler 's right to bring Allan on the record at all , since any such admissions could be placed in evidence and exploited by Col. Morton when the case came to trial . Now , since in our amended complaint we alleged facts establishing Allan 's negligence , all we were pleading , actually , was that if , when the thing ever came to trial , the jury should find Butler to be negligent as the plaintiffs charged , then Allan 's negligence , as described in our complaint , was also a contributing cause of the collision . The Supreme Bench , reasonable fellows all , saw no justification for not allowing such a plea , especially in the case of an automobile collision , where it is always possible that both drivers were at fault . On May 24 , they renderedtheir opinion , which reversed the order of the Court of Appeals affirming the order of the Circuit Court dismissing our second amended complaint against the additional defendant , and remanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no appealing this judgment . Charley set me up to a drink , and the suit was ready to be tried , Col. Morton in effect suing his only-begotten son . Bill Butler chuckledp195happily , for with Roosevelt so firmly entrenched in the White House and in public popularity as he was by 1937 , the Morton wing of the local Democratic party could ill afford any bad publicity . I wish , reader , that I could at this point announce some stratagem , some colpo mortale , some trump that I 'd saved to play on this last day of my career , when already I 'd been able to settle , as far as I was concerned , the Mack will case in favor of Harrison . But the truth is that my interest in Morton v. Butler ended with the Supreme Court 's ruling , for that terminated the procedural dispute . I did n't mind missing the actual trial , which would be dull enough whoever won . I had got out the record of the case on this last afternoon only because Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my desk , was coming to see me at two-fifteen . At two-thirty he strode in , chuckling , a bald , beefy fellow with good eyes and bad teeth , carrying a shoe box . " What do I owe you , Todd old cod ? " he sang out . " What 's my bill , bon ? " " You owe me your skin , " I smiled . " Charley would have hanged you . You better wait till after the trial to pay me the rest of your bill , though . " " Ai n't going to be any trial , " Butler chuckled . " Does the Colonel know that ? " " Oh hell yes indeedy , " Butler chuckled . " He 's the one thought of calling it off , honey . Called me yesterday , day before , gives me the old family squabble routine , old party harmony song-and-dance . Haw ! Told me if I 'd let some of his boys run on my ticket next year in the primary , he 'd call off the suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . " Butler chuckled grandly . " I told him he could have sheriff and one county commissioner if he 'd call his damn state cop off my ass . You know that cop Yarberry , that the Colonel got him his job ? Every time I go over the new bridge thatp196lousy Yarberry is after me  --  Colonel 's got him looking for me . I could tell you plenty on Yarberry and the Colonel , hon ! Old Colonel do n't much care about one lousy county commissioner , but he sure did want sheriff , so he promises to curb his cop and drop the suit . I already sent Evelyn anotherbunch of flowers . " " Hell , you did n't have to give him a thing , Bill , " I said again . " He 'd never sue his boy . " " Haw ! " Butler chuckled . " Tell you the facts , Todd old clod , I did n't have a sonofabitch in the stable to put up for them jobs , that I would walk on the same side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them anyhow . Oh hell yes indeedy ! That 's principles , buddy boy ! Give old Roosevelt another go-round in ' 40 , honey , and I 'll elect you governor . How ' bout that ? " " No trial , then ? " I grinned . " No trial , " Butler chuckled . " Fetch in old Charleyhorse from next door , hon , and we 'll try the Colonel 's whiskey . " He opened the shoe box and took out a fifth of Park &; Tilford . " Call up old Charleyhorse Parks , Julia , " he chuckled to Mrs. Lake . " Come on , there , Harry Bishop ; come on , here , Jimmy boy . We 're drinking up the Colonel 's whiskey ! " The calliope down at the wharf broke into " Out of the Wilderness . " I blushed , replaced the bulky brief of Morton v. Butler in the file , and accepted a good pull of Park &; Tilford.  |p197When  , as I said earlier , I came home from the office on the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house for my father , finally found him dead in the cellar , one end of his belt spiked to a floor joist and the other fastened around his neck , there was not a smudge of dirt anywhere on him , though the cellar was quite dusty . His clothes were perfectlycreased and free of wrinkles , and although his face was black and his eyes were popped , his hair was neatly and correctly combed . Except that the chair upon which Dad had stood was kicked over , everything in the cellar was in order . The same could not be said of his estate . Indeed , as soon became apparent , there was no estate . It is such a commonplacestory that I hesitate to tell it  --  and yet nothing was ever less true or pitiful for its being commonplace . Dad had had a sizable savings account ; between the years 1925 and 1927 he increased it by investing in stocks . He did n't expect the boom to last , and so decided to make one big splash and quit . To make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage and lot at Fenwick Island , Delaware , and one or two timber lots down the county  --  for as much as he could , and sank the whole wad on the market . In early 1929 ,  |p198when  the whole speculative structure began to quiver , and every public official in the country began to assure us that the economy was fundamentally sound , Dad mortgaged the house and lot , borrowed on his life insurance , and contracted private notes from what few of his many friends were willing and able to lend him money . All this , too , went on the market . No , not quite all : five thousand dollars he persuaded Harry Bishop to put in his safe-deposit box , in my name  --  suspecting , perhaps , that otherwise he 'd not be able to resist plunging that , too . Then the market collapsed . People were anxious enough to hire lawyers , all right , to collect debts , but they had no money to pay the lawyers with , and most debts had suddenly become uncollectable . Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countless loans , and no money to meet them with . Foreclosures threatened from all sides , lawsuits from every quarter . He would , it appeared , lose his summer cottage , his timber lots , the family home , the car , and virtually everything else he owned . His debts amounted to perhaps $35,000 . He would have to sleep in the office , walk to court , wear his suits threadbare . Very possibly he would never reach again his former security , never regain all his former respect . It was a hard pill to swallow . Instead of swallowing it anyway , or at least trying to , he hanged himself . Does one 's father hang himself for a simple , stupid lack of money ? And is one expected to set up again the chair one 's father has kicked over in his strangling frenzies ? Can one actually , with a kitchen knife , saw through the choking belt ? Carry one 's father 's body up to the bed whereon one was conceived , and laying him on it , dig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release the dead neck from its leather collar ? Reader , I still recall with shudders a summer day when I was five years old . My father ( dressed , of course , in good clothes ) for some reason or other was killing chickens in the back yard . He caught one , and holding it by the feet ,  |p199laid  it on the chopping block , a sawn stump ; unruffled by the flailing wings , he raised the old axe , which he held choked close to the head , and with a soft stroke beheaded the hen . The head still lay on the stump , the little red eyes staring , the beak opening and shutting in soundless squawks . The body , once my father released it , flailed madly about the yard for a full thirty seconds and then died . I watched everything with great , uneasy absorption . Dad picked up the chicken by its feet again and extended it toward me . " Will you take this in to Bessie , please ? " I was shocked , and held out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand  --  cold , hard , dirty , stringy , scaly , dead yellowfeet . I was ill then , reader , and if I think of those feet a minute longer I shall be ill as heartily now . But of this matter one can think , if queasily . Is one , then , expected to close the popping eyes of his father 's corpse ? Eyes the very veins of which are burst ? Surely the dirt of the planet would scream the overwhelming reason for it , the justification that would brook no questioning . I waited . Of course there were debts . The Fenwick place ; take it . The timber lots ? To be sure . The house ? The car ? The insurance ? Take them , take them . One does n't concern oneselfwith trifles at one 's father 's grave . One is concerned only with reasons . I waited . Back at the office , Harry Bishop gave me the envelope from Dad . I took it eagerly , hoping it would contain the answer , but instead it merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note , too , which I must have suppressed  --  it 's honestly , completely gone from my mind  --  because it said all the things I certainly did n't want to hear , in just the wrong language . Is five thousand dollars enough to pay for digging my fingers under that belt ? It 's not enough payment even for thinking about it ! His debt to me was the last , but hardly the least debt my father had escaped.  |p200If  I was demoralized by Dad 's death , I was paralyzed by the five thousand dollars and the note . Certainly I sat in the office for thirty minutes with my jaw actually slack , staring as incredulously at the bills as if I 'd opened that precious last envelope and discovered inside a handful of dung , the color of a hanged man 's cheeks . Five thousand dollars ! After some time I replaced the crisp new thousand-dollar bills in their envelope , which was , after all , unstarnped and unaddressed , and thought of all the people I knew . The question became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Col. Henry Morton . I wrote on the envelope Col. Henry Morton , c/o Morton 's Marvelous Tomatoes , Inc. , Cambridge , Maryland , put a three-cent stamp in place , and snuffling like a hobbled race horse , dropped the envelope into a mailbox on my way to lunch . Next day I moved into the Dorset Hotel . This was , I believe , in early March , 1930 . Very soon afterwards I received a call from the Colonel , whom I knew only slightly . " Hello ? Hello ? " he shouted , as though it were not his custom to speak on telephones . " Is this Todd Andrews ? " " Yes , sir . " " Hello ? Andrews ? Andrews , what 's this money I got from you in the mail ? " " It 's a gift from me to you , " I said . " Andrews ? You there , Andrews ? What 's going on , eh ? " " It 's a gift , " I repeated ; " a gift . " " Huh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It 's a gift , " I repeated . The day after that , the Colonel came in personally to see me , striding unappointed into my office . " Andrews ? You Andrews ? See here , young man , I do n't know what you 've got up your sleeve  --  " " It was a gift , " I explained ; " that 's all . "  | " A gift ? You 're crazy , son ! Here , take it back , and no more foolishness ! " He did not wave anything at me  --  no bills under my nose . " Of course not , " I said . " It was just a gift . " " Gift ? Well ! Gift ? ' What 's up your sleeve , young man ? What do you think I 'm supposed to do ? " " Not a blessed thing , sir , " I repeated . " It was a gift . " " I wo n't stand for tricks , " the Colonel warned . " Here , take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended nothing toward me . " I 've never been obligated to any man , " the Colonel said then , more calmly . " I sha n't begin now . " " No obligation , sir , " I insisted . " Hmph ! Whatever 's on your mind , you might as well forget it . I ca n't be bought ! If anybody was to ask me the secret of my success , I 'd tell them I was never obligated to any man . " " I 'd never try to obligate you , sir . It was just a gift . " " I 'll teach you a lesson , son . " The Colonel smiled , as though the idea had just dawned on him . " I 'm going to keep half your money , and you sha n't get a thing out of me in re-turn . " " You must keep it all , " I said . " I do n't take back gifts . " " Hmph ! You 've got a lot to learn , boy . A lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I sha n't , sir . " " Hard times , Andrews ! " the Colonel sputtered . " Bad times ! Plant 's laying off ! A man does n't throw his money away ! What 's on your mind ? Eh ? Eh ? " I shook my head . " Nothing , sir . No explanation . " The Colonel stood up suddenly to leave , looking grimly around my office and chewing his cigar . " I 'll teach you , boy , " he said . " You 'll wish you had it back ! " " No , sir . "  |p202He  started out and then grinned back into the doorway . " You'd 've been better off using it to square some of your Dad 's debts ! " he declared and , satisfied that he 'd demonstratedhis independence , left . Mrs. Lake gasped at his remark . Some time afterwards a letter came . Dear Mr. Andrews : By this time you are doubtless of a different mind concerning the transaction of some days ago . I am , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out my resolution for your instruction . Yours truly , Henry W. Morton I replied at once : Dear Col. Morton : I have not changed my mind at all . The matter to which you refer was not any sort of transaction , and you are not obliged to me in any way . It was a gift . Yours truly , Todd AndrewsWithin the month , Morton 's Marvelous Tomatoes , Inc. , became involved in a contractual dispute with a small shippingconcern that ferried some of the Colonel 's canned goods to Baltimore . The evidence was all in favor of the shipping company ( the suit was an intricate one , and I sha n't describe it here ) , but the Colonel had never lost a litigation before , and so he determined to spend his way to justice . An executivefrom MMT , Inc. , called on me and announced that the Colonel wanted Andrews , Bishop , &; Andrews to handle his defense . " Sure , " I said . " I 'm personally not interested , but Mr. Bishop can take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you to handle it personally , " the executive said ( he was Wingate Collins , a kindp203of vice-president ) ; " in fact , I 'm sure he is . I heard him say so . " But I declined . The Colonel took his business to Charley Parks , and ultimately obtained justice in the Court of Appeals . Then the drivers of the Morton Trucking Company , a subsidiary of the packing house , went on strike when the Colonel refused to allow the company union to affiliate with the CIO , and Norbert Adkins , of the union , asked our firm for legal counsel . Jimmy Andrews , who had just joined us , was itching for the job , and Mr. Bishop and I saw no reason why he should n't take it . But Wingate Collins gave us a reason . " I 'll tell you frankly , " he said , " the Colonel does n't want any of his friends to take that job . Your outfit would be pretty unpopular if you fellows took it . You know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I smiled . " You 've been going to the movies too much . " " I 'll tell you what , " he said . " You stand to come into a good thing if you do n't stick up for those strikers . The Colonel'sbeen unhappy with Matson &; Parks lately  --  just between us , of course  --  and he 's looking around for another law firm to represent MMT officially . That 's between six and eight thousand a year extra for the firm that gets it . The Colonel 's taken a liking to you , Todd , I do n't mind saying . He thinks you 're a very promising fellow . And I 'd bet my bottom dollar you 'd get that job if you 'll lay off these strikers . Hell , I know you would  --  off the record , now  --  I heard him say as much yesterday . " " I guess Jim wants to handle it , Wingate , " I said . " You 'd better talk to him . " " I already did , " Wingate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it 's up to you and Harry . Harry says he do n't care one way or the other . " " I do n't either , " I said.  | " Well , I frankly think you 're a damn fool , if you 'll excuse me for saying so ! " Wingate said heatedly . " The Colonel 'll have a tough time swallowing this , I declare ! " But apparently he swallowed it . Jimmy counseled the union in the arbitration that followed , and Matson &; Parks , next door , counseled the company . It was finally decided that the union would remain " independent , " and , solemnly , that the strikers would pay from their treasury for the damage to six trucks that they 'd overturned during the strike . During the next year or so , the Colonel approached me , either directly or through his vice-presidents , on ten differentoccasions with offers of business . I declined to handle any of them personally ( they were routine affairs , if lucrative ) ; some he took elsewhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whenever I encountered him on the street ( he rarely walked ) , he clapped me on the shoulder , took my arm , invited me for dinner , invited me for cruises on his yacht , invited me to membership in the Cambridge Yacht Club , the Elks , the Rotary , the Masons , the Odd Fellows ( the Colonel was a joiner ) , and the country club ( because I sometimes played golf , I was already a member ) . I declined his invitations politely . He fumed and stewed . More offers for legal business came in from Morton 's MarvelousTomatoes . " I 'll say quite frankly , " Wingate Collins said , quite frankly , " I think you 're a damn fool . What you got against us ? You fellows are passing up the chance of a lifetime . You got more money than you can use ? That it ? I 'll tell you the Christ truth , Todd , the Colonel 's got ants in his pants about that money you sent him  --  off the cuff , now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool , frankly , but he do n't know you like I do . He ca n't understand it . He 's got ants in his pants because he says he do n't want to be obligated to any man . Now , then . You 'd make him a lot easier to live with if you 'd take some of this business he 's throwing your way . "  | " The firm 's not turning it down , " I reminded him . " I 'm just not interested personally . " " Hell , man , it 's not like it 's an outright gift to you ! " Wingatecried . " He just wants to hire you , like anybody else might do . What you want to hold him by the tail for ? Nobodyelse ever got him so het up before ! " " He 's being childish , " I said . " He knows he 's not obligatedto me . He even took the trouble to get it in writing . " Wingate told me frankly I was a damn fool . Word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Mrs. Lake or Jimmy ) about the five thousand dollars , and I was asked about it by a few extra-curious people . " It was just a gift , " I shrugged . Most people , though , had already regarded me as rather eccentric , and so were pleased enough to have their suspicionsconfirmed . I heard through friends that one or two of Dad 's creditors were disgruntled , but of course the money was mine , not Dad 's , and so they could do nothing . Some cynics wondered what I was after . On Christmas the Colonel sent me , via his chauffeur , a case of Harvey 's Scotch , excellent stuff . When he got it back two days later , via the Cambridge Cab Company , he came again in person to my office . " Good morning , sir , " I said . " What can I do for you ? " " You can quit this damn nonsense ! " the Colonel said heartily . I offered him a cigar , which he refused almost violently . I waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit there and swear to God you gave me five thousand dollars out of a clear blue sky for nothing ? With times as hard as they are ? " " It was a gift , " I said . " Do n't think I do n't know why your father committed suicide , young man , " the Colonel said . " No offense intended ; you know how these things get around . "  | " That 's right . " The Colonel sighed impatiently and tapped his cane on the floor . " I do n't get it , " he said . " There 's nothing to get . " " Listen , " he said , rather quietly . " This need n't go beyond the two of us . Wingate Collins  --  you know him ? Good . Wingate Collins is my vice-president unofficially in charge of labor relations .

Wingate 's going to retire soon  --  he do n't know it yet  --  and I 'm going to hire a labor relationsman . Want a lawyer , somebody knows people . Take you half a day , five days . Five thousand a year , and you can keep your law practice on the side . " " Nope . " " Listen , " the Colonel said . " This is n't any gift . I do n't know anybody else I 'd rather hire . I 'm just glad I got to know you . " " Thanks , " I said . " I do n't want the job , sir , thank you just the same . " " Do n't want it ! " the Colonel cried . " Men are begging for work ! Do n't you want it ! " " No , sir . " " Yes ! " the Colonel shouted , forgetting himself . His face was red . " Nope , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the Colonel cried , but waved no bills under my nose . " Of course not . " The Colonel actually mopped his forehead with his handkerchief . " How about the Scotch ? " " No thank you , sir , " I said.  |p207He  rose to leave , quite shaken . " I shall have a great many guests in on New Year 's Eve , " he said softly . " You 'll get an invitation ; Mrs. Morton has alreadysent them out . It 's her first big affair , and she 's heard of you but has n't met you . " The Colonel had remarried perhaps a year before , his first wife having died in 1926 . " Thank you , " I said . " You need n't take the trouble to send it back , as you did the Scotch . There 's no need to insult Evelyn . Just throw it in your wastebasket . " I did indeed get the engraved invitation next day , and on New Year 's Eve , having drunk four double highballs in my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonel 's party , thinking it consistent with my policy of incomplete consistency . At eleven o'clock I took a cab out to the Morton estate on Hambrooks Bay . The party was in full swing when I arrived . Both wings of the great brick house were ablaze with lights , and perhaps a hundred and fifty people milled around inside , in tuxedos and gowns . I would n't have thought that there were that many tuxedos in Dorchester County . A champagne fountain had been rigged up in the main living room , and a sparkling burgundy fountain in the library . The women were drinking mostly from these . On the summer porch three white-coated Negroes tended bar , and male guests stood two deep before them . A small orchestra was playing in the club cellar . The butler took my coat and my invitation at the door , but before he could do anything with the latter , the Colonel caught sight of me from across the room , where he stood laughing with some **25;9710;TOOLONG friends . He stared incredulously for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke into a great smile . " Well , well , well ! " he roared , charging towards me with hand extended . " Andrews ! " He could think of nothing to say , and so pumped my arm for half a minute.  | " Well , well , well ! " he roared again . " Looks like a pleasant party , " I declared . " Well ! " the Colonel said . " Ha ! Say , you must meet Evelyn . Evelyn ! Evelyn ! " Evelyn appeared from the library , near at hand . She was perhaps forty  --  slightly more than half the Colonel 's age  --  and , perhaps because she 'd borne no children , her figure was still quite slender , and the skin on her face fairly tight . She was no beauty , but much better-looking than her husband . " Evelyn , this is young Andrews , Todd Andrews ; the young lawyer , you know . " " How do you do , Mr. Andrews . " " Good evening , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the honor , " Mrs. Morton smiled . I guessed that she was thoroughly enjoyingher first big affair : her smile was just a trifle liquorish . " Ha ! " the Colonel exclaimed , a bit nervously , and still held fast to my arm , as though afraid I 'd bolt for freedom . " He 's an independent young man , all right ! Yes , sir ! Well , what say to a drink , Andrews ? A little Scotch , eh ? Ha ! " " I thank you , " I said . " I 'll be seeing you in a moment , Mr. Andrews , " Mrs. Mortonsaid  --  rather coquettishly , I thought . " I certainly must get to know you while we 've got you . Toodleoo ! " " Toodleoo , " I said . " You 've made her very pleased by coming tonight , young man , " the Colonel confided as he marched me through the crowd to the summer porch . Many people turned to watch us go by . ' Well , it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since my saintly days prior to Dad 's suicide , and I found myself reverting almost unconsciously to that pose . As soon as I could escape the Colonel 's endless introductions to people I already knew  --  there were only ten or twelve strangers at the party  --  I garnered two double Scotches from one of the Ne/groes ( whom I also knew well ) and retreated to the darkened club cellar , which had been cleared out for dancing . An auxiliary , one-tender bar had been set up across from the orchestra , and so I was able to drink uninterruptedly for some time , watching the players and the dancers . And , truth to tell , I got really drunk , splendidly drunk , on the Colonel 's unparalleledScotch . What followed I must tell in broken sequences , for that is how I remember it : At midnight the place went absolutely to hell , as though every guest  --  there must have been more than two hundred then , or else all were in the club cellar  --  had decided simply to throw back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for several hours . The orchestra played on , but without audible effect , and people danced brokenly to no music . For a while someone was kissing me , and I proposed to whoever it was that we fling our glasses into the fireplace , as one should . " There is n't any fireplace . " " Well , into the noise , then . " " You ca n't hit noise , silly . " " Regardez , " I said , and threw mine at the drummer . I did indeed dance a tango with Evelyn Morton . Nay , ten , a dozen tangos , without the encumbrances of music or prior experience . And in every ill-lit corner , as his wife clung to me , I saw the Colonel smiling redly , benignly , nodding his great head , flashing his gold teeth , his gold-headed cane . Certainly there was a floor show of drunken wives of vicepresidents , to the horror of some husbands . A can-can line , so to speak . Remarkable . I recall vividly the upflung leg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that marked man . The roaring went on and on , no matter how many glasses one threw at the orchestra , who played in terror . There is a picture of the drummer shielding himself behind a great cymbal , apparently carried for that purpose ; of my thin , elegant highball glass glittering through the air top210splinter against the wall just off his starboard ear . No matter whom one attempted to dance with , it was Mrs. Morton  --  slender , graceful , unattractive , drunk  --  and the Colonel nodded . Then there was a tendency afoot to take cold showers in several of the upstairs bathrooms . These showers were taken by gluts of singing men . My group sang various verses of " Mademoiselle from Armentieres , " and I recall even now the ringing vibrancy of my baritone , but I do n't remember gettingwet at all until the entrance of wet Mrs. Morton . Standingoutside the shower , we had sung the line declaring that Mademoiselle had not enjoyed herself for forty years , and then somewhere between the hinkey and the dinkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shimmering , dripping Mrs. Morton leaped like a damp naiad from behind the shower curtain , into my arms . Her dewy bosoms , none too firm , crushed into my shirt front ; her dripping hair fell over her eyes ; her teeth sank into my lapel , into my boutonniere ; she ground herself against my trousers . We danced a magnificent parley-voo , stopping with a dip that dropped us both to the tiles , tapped by the tip of the Colonel 's cane . Mrs. Morton caught sight of the gold teeth glinting in the light from the bathroom bulb and swooned or died , sprawlingpink and sprinkled like a blushing dugong hoisted from the deep . I picked myself up meticulously and straightened my wet bow tie . The Colonel grinned feverishly and tapped his cane ( seven inches from his wife 's wet head ) as though conversing with her spirit by Morse code . " Mrs. Morton dances excellently , " I said , bowing slightly to the Colonel as I stepped over Evelyn en route to the door . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjunctionof wit and savoir-faire : " One is tempted to call her Morton 's Most Marvelous Tomato , is n't one ? Good night , sir . "  |p211One  was , in fact , tempted to add that it was indeed a pity to see such a fresh tomato stewed , as it were , if not altogether canned  --  but one knew well the delicate line beyond which the prick of wit becomes the sting of insult , and so one held one 's tongue and exited gracefully . In the new year that followed , the firm of Andrews , Bishop , &; Andrews was not pressed to render its services to the Colonel , nor was I dunned with invitations to join clubs or lodges , nor confronted at every turn with invitations to parties and dinners at the Morton manor . Indeed , if there have been any parties at the Mortons ' since that New Year 's Eve , I 've not heard of them . Jacob Matson , of Matson &; Parks , became vice-president in charge of personnel for MMT , Inc. , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions when I met Col. Mortonon Race Street and tipped my hat in greeting , he flushed red , bared his gold teeth , and ignored me with the grim smile of one who is obligated in no way to any man.  |p212At  three o'clock , just after Bill Butler and Charley Parks had left my office to have another small drink in Charley 's , Jane Mack came in with her daughter . I heard Jane exchange greetings with Mrs. Lake , and then little Jeannine  --  three and a half years old now , and brown and lovely like her mother  --  came up to my desk and watched me shyly . " Hi , Toddy , " she said . " Hi , baby . " " Honey , may I fix your pencil ? " " Sure . " It was Jeannine 's habit to sharpen everyone 's pencils . I gave her a good long one , and she went happily to the sharpener and proceeded to grind away on it . " Oh , my , " Jane said , coming into my office , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Toddy ? Any better ? " " Hello , Jane . I was n't sick . " " Then why did you act so silly last night ? " she asked , more softly , so that Mrs. Lake could n't hear . She perched on the corner of my desk . She was wearing khaki shorts  --  unusual for that year  --  and a blue cotton blouse , and looked quite fresh and desirable . " I guess I just was n't in the mood , " I smiled  |p213She  smiled back and patted me on the head . " That 's a stupid way to be , " she said . " I was in the mood . " " I was , too , " Jeannine declared from the pencil sharpener . " Maybe I 'm getting senile , " I proposed . " Stamina was never my strong point , as you know . " " I know your strong point , " Jane said . " Did you get my note ? " " I did indeed . " " You sent me a dumb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb one . " I smiled . " I do n't know what Marvin found wrong with me . He 'll bring the report around tonight , and we 'll look at it next time you 're up . " I had certainly expected some astonishment at this news , but Jane , unlike Harrison , did n't bat an eye . " God knows it 's time you went to a doctor , " she said . " Well  --  " She jumped off the desk . " I 'll be seeing you later at the house , wo n't I ? For a Manhattan ? Try not to keep Jeannine right in the sun for too long , if you can help it . She 's got that bonnet , but it 's awfully hot out , and she might not be all finished being sick yet . " " All right . " " I 'll be done at the hairdresser 's in an hour , if you want me to drop in and pick her up . If you 're finished before then and she gets on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her home . She likes that . And for God 's sake buy her an ice-cream cone . " " All right . " " ' Bye , now , honey . " Jane kissed her daughter . " So long , Toddy . " " ' Bye , Mommy , " Jeannine said . " So long , " I said , and she left . I was mightily impressed : between the time in 1933 when I insulted her and the time in 1935 when we resumed our affair , Jane 's personality had strengthened in some ways ; for one thing , she was unpre/dictable . I wondered with really quite sharp interest what she intended to do about my note , now that I 'd fulfilled the conditions of hers  --  and when it occurred to me that I 'd not be alive to find out , I experienced a small sensation of regret ; the only such sensation I felt that day . " Let 's go see the showboat , honey , " I suggested to Jeannine , who by this time was pushing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , honey , " she said , and very politely took my hand . We went out into the bright sun and walked the dry block to Long Wharf , where the showboat lay immensely along the bulkhead . Unlike its Mississippi counterparts , Adam 's Original &; Unparalleled Floating Opera was no **25;9737;TOOLONG of gilt and gingerbread . It was , by comparison with them , severely unadorned , for it had been built to withstand the sometimes tempestuous moods of Tangier Sound and the lower Bay , and even ventured into the Atlanticon occasion . The Opera itself was a long , narrow clapboardbox mounted on a massive barge . On the bow was lettered S. S. Thespian , the vessel 's registered name , but down both sides of the clapboards , in red letters three feet tall , was emblazoned its less modest trade name . A simple balcony affair graced either end of the theater , apparently for the employees ' benefit , and lifelines ran down both sides . On the roof were ventilators , stovepipes , clotheslines , lifeboats , a trim little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandstand , and the steam calliope , now silent . The whole structure was braced against humping or buckling by a trusswork of piers and cables on both sides . Two tugboatsmoored alongside , the Pamlico and the Albemarle , provided the showboat 's motive power . " What 's that , Toddy ? " Jeannine asked excitedly . " That 's a showboat , " I said . " Can you say showboat ? " " Showboat. "  | " Would you like to go up close and see it ? " " All right . " Fortunately , for I 'd forgotten my promise , some entrepreneurhad set up a refreshment stand near the bulkhead , and so I was able to buy two vanilla ice-cream cones before we went up for a close look at the showboat . Not many peoplewere curious enough to come out in the terrific heat ; we had the spectacle pretty much to ourselves , and I set Jeannineup on a piling to get a good view . As was her habit when excited , Jeannine slipped into the " Why ? " routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , Toddy honey ? " she shouted , awed at the Opera 's size . " It 's a showboat , hon. People go on it and listen to music and watch the actors dance and act funny . " " Why ? " " Why what ? " I asked . " Why do the actors act funny or why do the people like to watch them ? " " Why do the people ? " " The people like to go to the show because it makes them laugh . They like to laugh at the actors . " " Why ? " " They like to laugh because laughing makes them happy . They like being happy , just like you . " " Why ? " You understand , of course , that she was n't the least bit interested in either her questions or my answers , as questions or answers ; she was simply excited over the monstrous showboat , and wanted to hear me talk . I could have recited the alphabet in a knowing tone , and she 'd have been satisfied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the line . " " Why do the actors ? " " Why do the actors act funny ? They do that so the peoplewill pay to come see them . They want to earn money . "  | " Why ? " " So they can eat . They like eating . " " WhY ? " " You have to eat to stay alive . They like staying alive . " " Why ? " " That 's the end of the line again , " I said . " Hey there ! " cried a little man on the aft balcony . " Want to look ' er over ? " " Sure would , " I called back . " Thanks . " " Go on up forrard , I 'll show ye round , " he invited . " Want to go on the showboat ? " I asked Jeannine . " All right . " The little man met us at the gangplank and waved us aboard . He was tough-looking , wiry , and leather-faced , with knotted hands and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black trousers , an immaculate white shirt , and a yachting cap . Jeannine regarded him soberly while I shook hands . " Are you Captain Adam ? " " That 's a fact , sir , I am . Jacob Adam . Bring yer little girl along now , and I 'll show ye the boat . Quite a boat , ai n't she ? " " She is indeed , " I agreed . " Quite a boat , sir , " Capt . Adam agreed . " Thirty-one years old , she is , and she 's still sound as a dollar , if you know what I mean  --  " He tugged my arm and chortled . " Dollar ai n't worth what it was in 1906 ! " " Quite a boat , " he said again . " Had ' er built in Little Washington , North Carolina , in 1906 , sir , and I had ' er built strong . Why , you set one o ' them Miss'ssippi showboatsdown in the ocean for a minute , there would n't be a stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? " Jeannine demanded , gaining courage . " Did you use to run boats on the Mississippi ? " I asked . " No , sir , I do n't mind tellin ' ye , " the Captain declared , " I never set foot on a boat in my life till I built the Op'ry.  |p217Not  even a row-skiff ; now , then . I run a two-car ten-cent vaudeville show all over the country , sir , from 1895 till 1905 , and did so good I had to quit , ' cause ever'body I hired cut out to start a ten-cent show hisself . Next thing I knew there was so much competition I could n't make the nut . I figured I 'd set me up in something that takes a big wad to start with , so ever ' Tom , Dick , and Harry with ten bucks and a lot o ' brass ca n't squeeze in . I do n't mind tellin ' ye , I sunk sixty thousand dollars in this showboat , sir , in a time when dollars was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough , and I still got ' er . " " She looks plenty sturdy , " I admitted . So far we had n't moved from the gangplank : there is that in me which brings out old men 's garrulity . " She is sturdy , sir . Ye see them strakes along the sides there ? " He pointed to the barge 's side planking . " First time I saw them boards , they was trees . I walked around the Carolinawoods for a year , sir , pickin ' out my timber where it stood . **27;9764;TOOLONG long and four inches thick , them strakes , and not a splice in ' em from stem to stern , nor a knot , either . And I got ' em drift-bolted ever ' two feet with twenty-seven-inch bolts . That 's for the ocean , sir ! Thirty-two-foot planks across the bottom , beam to beam ; not a splice . Cost me plenty , sir , but it was money well spent , let me tell you . One time in 1920 we was caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a boat to us . I 'm not lyin ' , sir , for fourteen hours the waves was breakin ' over the Op'ry 's roof . Took Mrs. Adam 's pansies right out o ' the windowbox up there , but the Op'ry did n't spring a plank . That 's what plannin ' does , sir ! " Jeannine was jumping up and down ; I moved toward the shuttered box office . " Come on inside , " the Captain invited , taking the hint . We entered the theater , dark and cool , and Capt . Adam pro/vided us with a running commentary on what we were observing . " Seats seven hundred , " he said . " White folks down here and in the boxes , colored folks in the balcony . " Jeannine , happily , did n't ask why . " Used to be , could n't get a darkie on board , " he went on . " Word got around we was baitin ' ' em on to send back to Africa . ( That there stage is nineteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Used to carry a car on board , but the salt water ruined ' er , seemed like . " " Where 's your house ? " Jeannine demanded . " Well , little lady , I live up on the roof . " " Why ? " " Why ? Hell ! She 's a fresh one , ai n't she ? Well , sir , come on back here with me , and I 'll show ye the dressin ' rooms and all . " We followed the Captain behind the stage , where a row of numbered doors ran along a short hallway . " Good big dressin ' rooms , " Capt . Adam said proudly . " The actors live in ' em , too . Most ever'body 's into town just now , sir . " " Why ? " Jeannine murmured . " Now come on down here . " We were led down a companionway . " Here 's the cook 's quarters and the dinin ' room  --  we 're right under the stage now  --  and over there 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there door leads right out to the orchestra pit . What do ye think of ' er ? " " Very impressive , " I said . " Whole shebang do n't draw but fourteen inch o ' water , by golly . I always say , You give me a good-size mud puddle , I 'll give you a show ! ' Yes , sir . Six big ventilators up on the roof . Runnin ' water in all the dressin ' rooms . Plenty o ' heat in the wintertime . See them pipes runnin ' under the stage ? Heat pipes , water pipes , acetylene pipes for the footlights . "  | " You do n't use electricity ? " " I use it for the ventilators and lights too , when I can , but ye ca n't depend on it . Lots o ' landings ai n't electrified . Ye can give a show without ventilators , but not without lights . I carry two banks o ' footlights , one electric and one acety-lene . " I remarked that acetylene seemed a dangerous shipmate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adam denied . " Never had a speck o ' trouble . I got the tanks rigged outside , where a leak wo n't cause no trouble , and I just run it in through this little copperline here "  --  he indicated with his finger a small pipe leading through a valve , from which hung a sign reading Do Not Open Until Ready To Light Footlights  --  " and out to the foots . That there valve sends the gas out to the foot lights , sir . The rig works fine . Do n't ye worry , sir ; there ai n't nothin ' about this boat that ai n't been thought out plenty careful . Got a tug bow and stern , so she rides steady in a seaway . Got our circuit figured out so we hit fresh water twice a year , to kill off all the moss and barnacles on the bottom . Start out from Elizabeth City , North Carolina ( fresh-water town ) , soon 's it gets warm , and play up along Albemarle Sound , Pamlico Sound , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Port Deposit , hittin ' all the best landings on the way . That 's fresh water up by Port Deposit , so we head back home with a clean bottom again . Saves me a haulin ' out . " Jeannine had begun to fidget with impatience , and to swing back and forth on my hand . I thanked Capt . Adam for showing us around his craft , and he ushered us through a side door that led from the dining room , where we 'd been standing , to the starboard quarter of the barge . " Did you like the showboat ? " I asked Jeannine . " All right . " Her face was flushed , and I thought it best to get her out of the sun.  |p220We  passed the refreshment stand , unoccupied except for the vendor himself . " Toddy honey , will you buy me another ice-cream cone ? " Jeannine asked . " Why ? " " I want one , honey . " " Why ? " ? " I want one . " " Why do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But why ? Tell me why . " " I want one . " She got one , and we strolled back to the office in all the heat and light.  |p221A  little girl with her one little question can , like Socrates , bring any man to either anger , pique , or stalemate , dependingon his temperament . Consider : A man attends the Floating Opera . Why ? Excellentreason : a change from the old routine , a chance to laugh . Why is it better to laugh than not to ? Easy : because a laughing man is happy , and it 's better to be happy than sad . Why ? Well , without happiness , or the hope of it , a man might as well be dead , and surely it 's better to be alive than dead . Why ? The actors entertain the man . Why ? So that he 'll like them ; they want him to like them . Why ? They want him to tell all his friends . Why ? So that there 'll be a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Why ? For heaven 's sake ! So that they 'll make money to live on , of course ! Certainly it 's better to eat than to starve . Why ? Because to starve is to die ; it 's better to live . Why ? If one is wise , he will , confronted with a child like Jeannine , either rebuff her at once ( while she 's still a baby ) or else take refuge in the " if " clause , which in itself can be invulnerable : It the actors want to eat , it 's better for them top222please their audiences than to displease them . If you want to live , you should eat . This is no more than what I observed to Mr. Haecker : that if one is interested in intelligibility , then one should never use the words should or ought except after the word if . It is merely a corollary to the premise I offeredyou four chapters ago  --  that the values of things are not intrinsic , but are attributed to the things by people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference to certain ends , as illustrated above . This is not anything new to philosophy  --  in fact , after some research I found such a statement in my lecture notes from Johns Hopkins , 1922  --  but it is one thing to give it " notional " assent , quite another really to swallow and digest it . But if , like me , you are a child of the twentieth century ( I barely made it , to be sure ) , then digesting the premise should n't be impossible , even if we do n't find it palatable , and we might even throw down the corollary for good measure , as a chaser . But here , I think , in Jeannine 's questions , lies a real hogchoker : the reasons that people have for attributing value to things are always ultimately arbitrary ; that is , if the question Why ? is asked often enough , it will be discovered that the ultimate end ( which , remember , gives the whole chain its value ) is rationally indefensible , logically unjustifiable . SupposeHarrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars because he prefers Marxism to either fascism or capitalism . Why ? He answers , " If your end is social justice , Marxism is the best means . " Granting your hypothesis , why is justice better than injustice ? ( Here he might say " It just is , " as Mr. Haecker said " The simple fact of life is good , " in which case we 're dealing with beatific visions and can not ask further questions . ) " Because justice is the optimum conditionfor civilization : if you desire civilization , you must desire justice . " Why is civilization better than savagery ? " You should n't ask that : all the things you probably value are possible only in a civilized society . " End of argument , for223we 're back where we began . The point is that the if device , excellent for making value statements intelligible , is defensibleonly so long as the if 's are n't questioned . The reasons for which people assign value to things are always ultimately ( though not necessarily immediately ) arbitrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for calling anything important or valuable ; no ultimate reason for preferring one thing to another . Well , chew on that for a while , and I 'll get on with the story.  |p224Long  before we reached Court Lane , Jeannine 's second icecreamcone had melted all over her arm , was dripping from brown chin and dimpled elbow , all down her sundress and onto her sneakers . I paused under a great poplar tree to scrub her up a bit with my handkerchief . My head felt a little dizzy  --  whether from the sun or from my new premise , I could n't say . " Toddy , honey , I got to sit on the potty , " Jeannine remarked . " Can you hold on a minute ? " I grinned , hoping she would n't start asking why . I picked her up and strode quickly up the sidewalk , expectingat any moment to have my coat sleeve moistened , but Jeannine chuckled distractedly and clung tightly to my neck , her fat little arm over my mouth . " Mmm , you smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " You smell like my daddy , " she counteredglibly . " Ah . " We reached port safely , and Mrs. Lake took Jeannine to the lavatory . I spent the time writing a note to Jimmy An/drews , who stood not ten feet from me , and thinking about Jeannine , whose opinion it was that I smelled like her daddy . Very possibly , of course , she was right : I could certainly smell some Andrews in her infant curiosity . I finished the note ( which informed Jimmy of the letter from Eustacia Callader and instructed him to institute proceedingsagainst Harrison 's mother for recovery of that part of the estate which she 'd disposed of ) and put it in my inside coat pocket . A few minutes later Jane came in , her hair cropped short , and we left to go to her place for cocktails . I did n't bother to straighten out my desk , to say a last goodbye to Mr. Bishop , Jimmy , or Mrs. Lake , or even to take a final look at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? On the drive to East Cambridge , although I chatted amiablywith Jane and Jeannine , I was filled with myself and my plan , which had crystallized by then into its final form . If out of my meager vocabulary only the term unenthusiastic excitement comes anywhere near to describing the feeling with which all my thoughts were suffused , you must resolve my meaning from that term 's dissonance . There remained still no small measure of the excitement which had attended my first realization that I was ready to destroy myself ; but , like all my major decisions of policy , that resolution had been a rapid one , the effect of external impingement upon whatever was my current mask  --  and as in those other cases , the resolution itself was only afterwards rationalized into some kind of coherent and arguable position . Though it is too much to expect that I should become solemn about it , certainlythe direction of this day 's rationalizing was an awesome one  --  yet full of the attractiveness of desolation , the charm of the abyss . Such a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how chilling ! I heard beyond it the whistling of the black winds of Chaos ; my hackles rose at the thought , as if I had been breathed upon by a cold sigh from the pit.  |p226It  was four o'clock ; the heat lingered at its greatest intensity . What Jane 's car filled with as we drove over the creek bridge was not the black wind of Chaos , but the stench of the crabhouses , steaming up from small mountains of red carapaces and other nonedible parts of the crab thrown out in the sun by the pickers . It is a smell that grabs you by the nose  --  I 've seen many a visitor retch while crossing the creek in summer  --  but like many another thing , it can be lived with : most of the natives are n't even aware of it , and I , for one , have learned to relish it , to inhale it deeply and savor its every rank ingredient in my nostrils . I did so as we drove off the bridge , and composed a mental note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more absolute than any other kinds of pleasures , one would do well to outgrow conventional odor-judgments , for a vast number of worth-while smells await the unbiased nose . It is a meager standard that will call perverse that seeker of wisdom who , his toenails picked , must sniff his fingers in secret joy . A meditation worthy of a man 's last day ! It took its place beside my early morning 's reflection on Plato and the crabbers  --  agood day for my Inquiry !  --  and I continued without interruption my conversation with Jane , who was as a matter of fact talking quite animatedly . She had announced , to my surprise , that she and Harrison were planning a trip to Italy for the fall . " It 's Harrison 's idea , " she said , " and I 'm tickled to death with it . He wants to stay till Christmas , but I 'm holding out for Easter . I was there one summer when I was a kid , and it 's all beautiful ! I wish we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to judge my reaction , but that belief might be simple vanity . At any rate , I showed no reaction at all.  | " Are you counting on the inheritance to travel on ? " I asked . " It 's probably wiser not to . " She looked surprised . " I thought that was out of the question . Is n't it ? I 'd given up hoping for that . " " I suspect you 're doing the right thing . " " We 're going on Harrison 's salary . Hell , we can afford it . " She glanced at me again . " We might even consider selling the house  --  if you do n't mind . " " Why should I mind ? " " Well  --  " She shrugged her shoulders . " Do you think Harrison will be able to swallow Mussolini'sboys ? " " Oh , this is n't a political tour , " Jane smiled . " I 'm not even interested in politics , are you ? I do n't think Harrison is any more , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's getting cynical about political movements , I believe . He 's cynical about everything nowadays , in fact , but in a sweet way . I think he got it from you . " " Not the sweetness , certainly . " " Certainly not , " Jane said , and patted my leg . There was still some nervousness in her exuberance , or so I thought at least : I smelled a plan in the air , now that the crabhouses were out of range . " When did you decide all this ? " I asked cheerfully . " About the trip and the house ? " " Oh , it was Harrison 's idea , " she said . " About the trip . The house was my idea , because I want us to be independent . I guess it sort of popped up about a week ago . We have n't worked out any details . You do n't mind , do you , if we go ? I mean  --  " She looked at Jeannine , who was staring listlessly out the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course I do n't mind . " " I 'd love it ! With the money from the house we could stay there a year . Harrison can fix it with his job . God , just think  --  Italy ! "  | " When did you get so hot on Italy ? " I smiled . " I 've always been hot on Italy . Did n't I tell you ? Are you mad at me , Toddy ? " " No . " " You kind of acted like it . " We pulled up in front of the Mack house , and I lifted Jeannine down to run to Harrison , who waved from the porch . " Were you offended by my note this morning ? " Jane persisted as we walked up the lawn . " I certainly did n't think you 'd take me up on going to Marvin , but I 'm glad you did . " " How about my note ? " I asked . " Harrison seemed a little concerned when I told him lunchtime I 'd been to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Should I be alarmed ? What about ? " By that time we were at the porch , and Jane skipped up the steps , kissed Harrison lightly on the forehead , and disappeared inside . Usually we drank our Manhattans on the porch , but on this day it was much cooler in the living room . Harrison and I chatted for a few minutes about the weather , agreeing that the dull haze over the Bay prophesied a squall , and then we went inside . " So you 're going to Italy ? " I remarked . " Yes , it looks like it , ' Harrison confessed , fumbling at once for a cigarette in his shirt . " Did Janie tell you ? " " A minute ago . I think it 's a fine idea , of course . " " Do you really ? Well , I was n't so sure . It means selling the house and all  --  but you know how crazy Jane is about Italy , Fascists or not , and I 'd like to see the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to blow up over there sooner or later . Frankly , I was n't sure how you 'd feel about it , " he added carefully . " How I 'd feel ? What possible difference could it make if I objected ? And I do n't , at all . "  | " Well  --  " Jane reappeared from the kitchen , and behind her came the maid with our cocktails . Jane sat down beside Harrison , on the couch ; I was in an easy chair across the room , facing them . " Well , " Jane said brightly , smiling at her cocktail . We all sipped intently . " Will you be going to the showboat tonight ? " Harrison asked me , laughing . " Maybe so . I had n't thought much about it . " " Jeannine was crazy about it this afternoon , " Jane told Harrison , for my benefit . " She got two ice-cream cones , and the man took her and Todd all over the boat . " " Oh ? Well , " Harrison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she 's a little feverish . I called Marvin , and he says do n't worry . " We sipped some more . " Why not have supper with us ? " Jane asked me . " It 's just cold platters  --  sliced ham and potato salad . " I shrugged . " Sure , if you want . " " I 'll tell Louise . " She jumped up and went into the kitchen again . Harrison and I sipped and sipped , and after a while I lit a cigar . " Do n't be offended by what I 'm going to say now , Toddy , " Harrison began , and immediately , involuntarily , I smiled around my cigar : the pressure was off . " You ca n't offend me , " I declared . " Well , here 's the thing . You know very well we 'd like to have you come along with us to Italy "  --  I made a quick gesture of negation  --  " but I figured you had your work , and besides , the fact is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two of us . Three , counting Jeannine . You know . " " Sure , man ; do n't even speak of it . " " Well , that 's not the thing . The thing is , of course Janie wo n't be around here for a year , maybe two years , you neverp230can tell . Now  --  I do n't know how I can say this without hurting you , Toddy  --  the truth is , I kind of think when we come back ( I do n't know when that 'll be ) what with Jeannine getting older and all  --  well , it might not look too good , you know what I mean , if Janie kept on going up to the hotel . " " I agree completely , " I said at once . " Hell , I guess you 're insulted , Toddy . I do n't want you to take it the wrong way . You know what I think of you , and how much I 've approved of the whole thing . But hell , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , I want to make certain you take it right , " Harrison persisted , examining his empty glass closely . " It 's not that we like you any Less  --  " Jane came in , glanced quickly at me , then at Harrison , and took a seat midway between us . She absorbed herself in rubbing her brown knee . " You do n't need to explain anything , " I insisted firmly . " As a matter of fact  --  " " I 'll tell you the honest truth , Toddy , " Jane broke in ( I believe it was the very first time she 'd ever interrupted me ) . " If it 's all right with you , I 'd like to call the thing off as of now . Do you mind ? " " I was just going to suggest it , " I said . Jane smiled briefly at her knee . " I 'd been thinking about it for some time . " " Well , let me see if I can explain it right , Toddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasantly . " I 'm not too good at expressing things . " " There 's no need to say a word , " I declared . " Oh , yes there is , " she smiled . " I do n't want to break it off unless you can understand everything . " " I understand everything . " " No , you do n't , " Jane said sweetly . I looked up in surprise.  | " If you 'd understood everything , there would n't have been that trouble a few years ago . " " Whoa , now  --  " I protested . " Let me see if I can say what I want to say , and then you can take it apart , " she proposed . I grinned shortly at Harrison , who , however , did n't see me , engrossed as he was in his empty glass . " When Harrison and I got married we were as prudish as they come about extracurricular sex , " Jane began . " I swore I could never look at another man , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sexual way . Then as we got more sense we saw how dishonest that was  --  is that the right word ?  --  yes , dishonest ; and stupid , too . I wo n't go into all that ; you understand , I think . Well , we decided there was nothing wrong with either of us making love to somebody else just for fun , because we were absolutely sure of each other . There could never be any jealousy between us . I was very attracted to you as Harrison 's friend , and as soon as we did n't have to be stupid or dishonest any more , I realized I 'd like to make love to you . And except for the one bad spell , it worked out fine . It was mostly our fault , we realize , about that bad time . We had no right to expect so much . " " Oh , I do n't know . " I shrugged . This was all very embarrassingfor Harrison and me . " Well , anyhow , neither one of us has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Or that you 're calling it off , " I smiled . " Aw , hell , man , do n't be bitter , " Harrison complained . " I did n't mean it that way . " " You 're right , " Jane said . " We do n't have to have any regretsabout that , either , if you can try to understand why I 'm doing it . " " Is it because of that note this morning ? " I asked . " The note ? Oh , that stupid thing ! I never did pay any attention to that . I just assumed you were upset about lastp232night , for some reason or other . I sent you my note as a joke , to get even . Heavens no , that 's silly ! I had n't even considered it . Here 's the thing : I do n't want you to think that Harrison and I are retreating in any way to our old standards , just because we 're calling this off . " I raised my eyebrows . " Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean is , we were kind of unsure of ourselves when we decided to try this extracurricular business . I guess that 's why we were so demanding , come to think of it . We wanted reassurance that we had n't made a mistake . God knows that 's understandable enough ! " " I think that 's probably why Janie thought she was in love with you , " Harrison put in , " and why I thought that was a good thing . " I pursed my lips . " That 's right , " Janie agreed , looking at her husband . " Then after we started up again , after Jeannine was born , everything was just fine . We all understood each other perfectly , and nobody was kidding himself . Now , then . What I want to say is that it was kind of necessary before to be actually carrying on an affair , to prove to ourselves that we meant what we were talking about . But now I do n't feel like it 's necessary any more . I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess ; that I 'm sure enough of our attitudes toward this business that I do n't have to be demonstrating it all the time , or ever again , for that matter . I just feel stronger , is all . Harrison does , too . Do you understand anything I 've said , Toddy ? " " I told you before , I understood everything before you said a word . I exude understanding . Did n't I say that the same thing exactly was on my mind ? I was going to broach the subject this evening . " " He does n't understand , " Harrison observed to Jane . I turned to him at once , startled , but said nothing.  |p233Jane  sighed . " I ca n't make it any clearer . " The maid signaled silently from the dining room . " Dinner 's almost ready , if you want to wash up , " Jane said . She got up and headed for the kitchen , paused , and came over and kissed me lightly on the mouth . " You were wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope this does n't leave you with a bad taste . " I licked my lips appreciatively . " It tasted fine , " I said . Jane laughed and went to help the maid , and Harrison and I went upstairs to wash . " Did you find a buyer for the house yet ? " I asked him . " No , not yet , " Harrison said . " Matter of fact , the whole thing 's been sort of tentative . All we knew for sure is that we wanted to go to Italy for a while . It 's kind of crazy , I guess , but a small town can be right stultifying . " We talked for a while in the bathroom , but there was a coolness between us that made all the conversation a bit forced . The friendship , in fact , was over  --  at least on any intimate level , and that 's the only level I cared for , though I 've never quite attained it with anyone . And at dinner afterwards , the talk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth . Harrison and Jane seemed fused into one person , alienated from me by their own doing instead of mine , entirelyself-sufficient . They should , it occurred to me , be permanently locked together , like the doubler crab or Plato 's proto-humans . I caught myself smiling inadvertently at my cold cuts all through the meal , as I thought of Jane 's speech . And , I am obliged to add , I noticed several times that Harrisonand Jane smiled at their cold cuts as well : for what reasons , I sha n't presume to say . A final observation : When , after dinner , I went upstairs to the bathroom before leaving the house ; when , indeed , I stood there comfortably reflecting , an entirely unexpected emotion gripped me : I suddenly wavered in my resolution to die  --  was shaken , in fact , by reluctance . The reason was simply thatp234my suicide would be interpreted by the Macks as evidence that their move had crushed me ; that I was unable to endure life after their rebuff . And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loathed . But , happily , this faltering lasted only a moment . By the time I 'd washed my hands , I had come to my senses ; my new premises reasserted themselves with a force that brooked no quibbling . What differencedid it make to me how they interpreted my death ? Nothing , absolutely , makes any difference . Nothing is ultimatelyimportant . And , sane again , I was able to see a nice attraction in the idea that , at least partly by my own choosing , that last act would be robbed of its real significance , would be interpreted in every way but the way I intended . This fact once realized , it seemed likely to me that here was a new significance , if possible even more genuine . Passing down the hallway from the bathroom to the stairs , I happened to glance into my old bedroom , now a guest room , and my eye fell on a large mirror near the bed . I chuckled so hard that my eyes watered , and I walked jauntily down the stairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll be seeing you around , " Harrison called from the porch as I left ; and Jane , too , added most cheerful goodbyes . " So long , so long , " I called back , just as cheerfully . Lookingover my shoulder as I walked down the road , I saw them standing close beside each other , talking together as they watched me leave . Perhaps  --  I clucked my tongue  --  their arms were even encircling each other 's waists . I waved , but they did n't see me . I turned and went on , headed back toward the hotel . I believe I might even have whistled something or other , for I was as unburdened at that moment as must have been Socrates when , Xanthippe at last departed , he was free to face without distraction the hemlock that lay at the end of his reasoning.  |p235No  , wait : that Socrates metaphor , that really quite admirable sentence I just wrote  --  that does n't apply quite yet . There was one final matter to be settled before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to decide what to do about Harrison 's three million dollars . I paused halfway across the creek bridge to think about it . In order to focus the problem sharply , I took from my billfoldthe letter from Eustacia Callader , and from my coat pocket the note to Jimmy Andrews , and laid them both before me on the bridge railing . Either I must put Eustacia 's letter in my writing desk , where Jimmy was instructed to find it , and drop the note to Jimmy in the mailbox , or else I must drop both documents into the creek below , where fat gray seagulls fed lazily on white perch killed by the pollutionfrom the packing houses . The first course would result in Jimmy 's filing suit for Harrison against Elizabeth SweetmanMack , charging that , by allowing her gardener , R. J. Collier , to spread the contents of the seventy-two pickle jars on the ailing zinnias , she had disposed of a portion of the Mack estate which was no more hers to dispose of than the three million dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hearing of my appeal of the Circuit Court 's order ( to execute the will in favor of Mrs. Mack ) until after Joseph Singer had replaced Rollo Moore on the Court of Appeals bench . Then Jimmy would drop the suit and argue our appeal : for the reasons explained in Chapter X , the lower-court order would almost certainly be reversed , and Harrison would get the inheritance . If , on the other hand , I decided to drop both letters into the creek , then there was little chance that the appellate court would do anything except affirm the court order . Now , you 'll recall that in the morning I had decided that the basis for my decision was to be Harrison 's and Jane 's strength ; specifically , whether they had the strength not to care , except superficially , whether they got the money or the manure . And I must say that the morning 's note from Jane and my luncheon conversation with Harrison had both prejudicedme in their favor . By afternoon I had , although I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved to let the deciding factor be Jane 's response to my note of the early morning , now that I 'd fulfilled the conditions of hers by going to see Marvin Rose . If she chose to make Capt . Osborn the happiest old satyr in the county , I 'd make her the richest woman in the county ; if she was as angry and insulted by my proposal as Harrison had been by the incident in my office in 1933 , then I 'd destroy the letters . But Jane had nullified this basis by choosing a third course , one difficult to evaluate . She 'd been neither angry nor insulted , nor had she felt obliged to carry out her end of the bargain . She 'd simply laughed at the whole thing . Was this evidence of obtuseness , insincerity , or a real and formidable strength ? In fact , I no longer knew how to feel about the Macks at all , whether their new resolutions were manifestationsof a commonplace sentimentality or a strange integrity . I had no feeling about them at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thep237creek for several minutes , I chose a new basis for judgment : taking a nickel from my pocket , I flipped it , caught it , and slapped it down on the letters . Heads , I preserve them ; tails , they go in the creek . My hand uncovered the skinny-assed , curly-tailed old buffalo.  --  Despite which fact , I gathered up the letters , dropped one in the mailbox on the corner of Academy , Market , and Muse Streets , just off the creek bridge , and put the other in my desk when I reached the hotel . Harrison , you see , had survived a double chance : that the coin would demand the destruction of the letters , and that I would allow myself , a free agent , to be dictated to by a lousy nickel . Then , let us say , I doubtless whistled some tune or other , for I was as unburdened at that moment as must have been Socrates when , Xanthippe at last departed , he was free to face without distraction the hemlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes after six o'clock when I reached my room , set my straw on the dresser top , and prepared to put in a last evening 's work on my Inquiry . I gathered around my writing desk the three peach baskets and one cardboard box of notes and data , put in a convenient place the empty beef-stew can that functioned as my ashtray , and began my night 's work by transcribing from memory the two mental notes I 'd made that day ( concerning the doubler crabs and the smell of the creek ) and filing them at an appropriate depth in one of the peach baskets . Then I sat back in the chair and stared at the window for a while , deciding which aspect of the project should receive my attention . When the clock on the People 's Trust Company chimed six-thirty ( the Macks , as usual , had eaten early ) , I sat up , took a long ruled sheet of yellow legal paper from one of the dozens of pads stacked on the desk , and wrote on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I regarded this sentence for some minutes before adding to it , and because so much staring and regarding isp239much duller to describe than it is to do , let me use the time to explain as clearly as I can the nature and history of my Inquiry ( any such summary of so intricate and vast a subject will , of course , be oversimple ) and of the great project of which the Inquiry itself is only one part . The full title of the Inquiry , if ever it should reach the stage of completion where a title would be appropriate , will , I suppose , be An Inquiry into the Circumstances Surroundingthe Self-Destruction of Thomas T. Andrews , of Cambridge , Maryland , on Ground-Hog Day , 1930 ( More Especiallyinto the Causes Therefor ) , or something of the sort . It is simply an attempt to learn why my father hanged himself , no more . And no less  --  for it became apparent to me after a mere two years of questioning , searching , reading , and staring , that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any human act . Easy enough to spend weeks poring over bank statements , budget books , letters from stockbrokers ; to spend months examining newspaper files , stock-market reports , volumes on the theory and the history of economics ; to spend years in careful , unhurried , apparently casual questioningof every person who had more than a superficial acquaintanceshipwith my father . All this is just more or less laboriousresearch . But it is quite another thing to examine this mass of information and see in it , so clearly that to question is out of the question , the cause of a human act . In fact , it 's impossible , for as David Hume pointed out , causation is never more than an inference : we never see causes . And any inference , of course , involves at some point the leap from what we see to what we ca n't see . Very well . It is the purpose of my Inquiry , then , to shorten as much as is humanly possible the distance over which I must leap ; to gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning the circumstances of my father 's suicide . Say , if you wish , that the true reason for this investigationp240is my reluctance to admit that Dad hanged himself because he was afraid to face his creditors . Perhaps so ( much noble work has been accomplished for more questionable reasons ) , although consciously , at least , I have a different reason . At any rate , I am certainly prepared to admit that my observationof the data I collect is biased , and it is partly for that reason , as I 'll explain further presently , that even in 1937 I kept one peach basket reserved for notes on myself  --  it was into this basket that my two thoughts of the day , for example , were filed . It would , perhaps , be more accurate to say that my rejection of the stock-market losses as the cause of his suicide was the hypothesis with which I approached the Inquiry , the thesis that oriented my investigations . You understand , do you , that the nature of my purpose  --  to make as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily renders the Inquiry interminable ? Because , you see , one can never know for sure that every last scrap of informationhas been discovered , and so one must be perpetuallysearching for another scrap . One could , of course , stop at some point and declare , " I have sufficient information to warrant the inference that the cause of Thomas T. Andrews ' suicide was such-and-such . " But my purpose is not really to leap the gap ( which can be abysmally deep , however narrow ) , only to shorten it . So , the task is endless ; I 've never fooled myself about that . But the fact that it 's endless does n't mean that I ca n't work on other things , other aspects of the grand project , even though the completion of those aspects depends ultimately on the leaping of the gap in my Inquiry . It does n't follow that because a goal is unattainable , one should n't work toward its attainment . Besides , as I have observed elsewhere , processes continued for long enough tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , I should continue my researches simply in order to occupy pleasantly the two hours after dinner . But let 's suppose that by some miracle , by some divinep241revelation , it were given to me to know the unknowable , to know the cause or causes of Dad 's suicide . My Inquiry would then be complete . But my researches would not , for after supper on the day of that revelation I should simply draw to my desk a different peach basket  --  that one beside the lamp there  --  and after some minutes of wall-staring , resume work on a larger Inquiry , of which the above-mentioned Inquiry is at most a relevant chapter . And this Inquiry , had I world enough and time , might someday be entitled An Inquiry into the Life of Thomas T. Andrews , of Cambridge , Maryland ( 1867-1930 ) , Giving Especial Consideration to His Relations with His Son , Todd Andrews , ( 1900  --  ) . In other words , a complete study of my father 's mind and life from his birth in the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cellar ; from the umbilicus that tied him to his mother to the belt that hanged him from the floor joist . Truly a monumental task : it is my aim to learn all that can be learned of my father 's life ; to get the best possible insight into the workings of his mind . To do this I must , in addition to carrying out on a larger scale all the researches described in connection with the other Inquiry , perform extra labors as well  --  I must read , for example , , all the books that I know my father read , looking for possible influences on his character , his way of thinking . If one can compare infinities , this task is even more endless than the other . I said a moment ago that the death-Inquiry was but a chapter in the life-Inquiry ; this is not entirely true . For in another sense , the study of Dad 's life is only a necessary preliminaryto the study of his death . And ultimately , I should say , they stand side by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really want to discover is the nature and extent of my father 's contribution to the imperfect communication that existed between us . Imperfect communication , that is the problem : the im/perfect communication that existed between my father and myself . If you understand that ( for to go into greater detail would enmesh us beyond all hope of ever returning to the story ) , then I think it is time to pass on to the last document of all  --  the document of which my two colossal Inquiries combined are no more than important studies for one aspect : the Letter to My Father . This document dates from the fall of 1920 , when after my unsuccessful attempts to tell Dad about my uncertain heart , I enrolled in Johns Hopkins University . I had resolved , you 'll remember , not to tell him at all while I lived , because I believed that my death was imminent and that therefore I 'd as well humor him during what remained of my life . NeverthelessI worried that I 'd been unable to tell him when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ) that the both of us would go to our graves without ever having understood each other . And so I began to write a letter to my father , working on it in snatches during my four exhausting years at Hopkins . The letter was to be found by him after my death , and its original purpose was to explain to him what Dr. John Frisbee had told me about my heart . But this purpose , though I never lost sight of it , was soon subsumed into a larger one . Naively ignorant of the fact that there never exists between people  --  especially between fathers and sons  --  the sort of communicationI seem always to have longed for , I set out to study myself , to discover why my communication with Dad had always been imperfect . I reviewed my whole life carefully , selecting and rejecting incidents for use in the letter . I spent a month , at least , attempting to explain to Dad why I 'd never finished building my boat in the back yard . More than a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( with whom my communication had been pitifully imperfect ) and to analyzing the effects on me of a certain particular popping noise . I worked , of course , ir/regularly , completing perhaps twenty pages of notes and one page of letter every month ; seldom more than that . By the time I was installed in law school , the letter was perhaps fifty pages long , and I had a respectable stack of notes . I did not shy away from mentioning Betty June Gunter , even , although I realize now that those early attempts to understandour liaison were shallow . Especially between 1925 and 1927  --  the first of my saintly years  --  I worked with some diligenceon the letter . Then in 1927 , when I set up practice in Cambridge , the letter and notes were packed into my trunk . I moved in with Dad and to my great pleasure found myself  --  or so I believed  --  closer to him than I 'd ever been before . He was still garrulousand gruff by turns , but I thought I was beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our communicationwas becoming less imperfect , and in this hope I abandoned the letter . I had , you see , always assumed that the source of the imperfection was in myself , and it seemed to me that perhaps as I matured ( although I was twentyseventhen ) my difficulty would vanish . But Dad hanged himself , and rack my memory as I might until sleep was a red-eyed wish , I could find no adequate reason for his act . I realized then that I had been pursuing an impossible task since 1920 : to understand an imperfect communication requires perfect knowledge of the party at each end , and I 'd been studying only myself . When , in the course of moving into the Dorset Hotel , my letter and notes came to light , I put the pages of the letter on my new writing desk , dumped the notes into an empty suitcase ( not until later did I begin to use peach baskets ) , and began to work on it again . I saw at once that the next step was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand the nature and extent of his contribution to our imperfect communication ; and at the same time I saw the necessity of a special and separate inquiry into the circumstances surrounding hisp244death , this inquiry to be in the nature of a control ( for unless the suicide were explained , nothing was explained ) and also perhaps a key ( for should I find the answer to the question of his death , the whole problem might be solved by the same solution ) . Thus my two Inquiries were initiated ; but they did not close off my work on the letter and the notes on myself . You see , then , the purposes of the three peach baskets beside my desk in 1937 : one represented the life-Inquiry , one the death-Inquiry , the third the less organized self-Inquiry . And the cardboard box ( MORTON 'S MARVELOUS TOMATOES ) contained the drafts of the letter to my father . To be sure , he can never now receive it , since I outlived him . If you do n't see that this fact only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hence only intensifies the need for the letter , instead of eliminating it , then between you and me , too , the communication is less than perfect . But you shall have to investigate it : I 've quite enough to do with the three baskets and the box beside me  --  four parallel projects which , like parallel lines , will meet only in infinity . On this particular evening , to be sure , their progress would cease , for the notes I took then I intended to be my last . I. Nothing has intrinsic value . Things assume value only in terms of certain ends . II . The reasons for which people attribute value to things are always ultimately arbitrary . That is , the ends in terms of which things assume value are themselves ultimately irrational . III . There is , therefore , no ultimate " reason " for valuing anything . By seven o'clock , these were the things I had written on my piece of paper , not knowing exactly which file would finallyp245receive them . But I felt very strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rationalizing , was of supremeimportance to my Inquiries and my letter . In fact , when in the same list I entered the Roman numeral IV , without yet writing anything after it , I had a nostril-flaring sensation of the chase ; I felt that some sort of answer was on the verge of being treed . I called these ideas rationalizings , and so they were : the post facto justification , on philosophical grounds , of what had been an entirely personal , unphilosophical resolve . Such , you remember , has been the case with all my major mindchanges . My masks were each first assumed , and then justified . My heart , reader ! My heart ! You must comprehend quickly , if you are to comprehend at all , that those masks were not assumed to hide my face , but to hide my heart from my mind , and my mind from my heart . Understand it now , because I may not live to end the chapter ! To be sure , each mask doubtless hid other things as well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose and mouth ; but it was to hide my enigmatic heart that I became a rake , a saint , and then a cynic . For when one mask no longer served its purpose of disguise , another had perforce to take its place at once . I had been a not-very-extraordinary boy ; then one day in 1919 while standing retreat I collapsed on the parade grounds at Fort Meade , Dr. Frisbee looked up from his stethoscope , and I began to eat , drink , and be merry at Johns Hopkins  --  my first mask . In 1924 Betty June Gunter slashed me with a broken bottle , a man named Cozy rabbit-punched me and threw me out of a Calvert Street brothel , Marvin Rose found a wicked infection in my prostate , and I became a saint  --  my second mask . In 1930 my father , with whom ( thinking my saintliness was bringing on maturity ) I had thought I was beginning to communicate , inexplicably hanged himself ; I took the belt from his neck , mailed myp246legacy to Col. Morton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each time , it did not take me long to come to believe that my current attitude was not only best for me , because it put me on some kind of terms with my heart , but best in itself , absolutely . Then , on the night of June zz or 23 , 1937-But now you must know my last secret . In my life I have experienced emotion intensely on only five occasions , each time a different emotion . With Betty June in my bedroom I learned mirth ; with myself in the Argonne I learned fear ; with my father in the basement of our house I learned frustration ; with Jane Mack in her summer cottage I learned surprise ; with my heart , in my hotel room on the night before this last day , I learned despair , utter despair , a despair beyondwailing . My despair began , not with my heart , but with two other parts of my body . Jane Mack was in my room for the night , as you know . She had come in at perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortly afterwards . Jane had sat Turkfashionon the bed for some time , plucking her eyebrows before we turned out the light , and I had stroked her idly while I lay beside her reading a book . We had n't been talking at all . Then , taking my hand in hers to examine it , she said , " I love your body , Todd  --  all but your fingers . Did you ever ask Marvin about them ? My , they 're ugly . " Involuntarily I jerked my hand away , blushing hotly . Had you forgotten that my fingers were clubbed ? Ah , and so had I , reader , and Jane 's remark , though offered in a mild enough tone , stung me all out of proportion to my actual sensitivity about my fingers  --  perhaps because I 'd been caressing her . " Oh , I 'm awfully sorry , honey ! " she said at once , alarmed . " I did n't mean to insult you at all . " She tried to kiss my fingers then , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight . My subsequent failure at love-making no doubt grew out of that . For one thing , in her efforts to redeem herself Janep247made all the advances , immediately , and I have rarely respondedwell in such situations . For another , the remark about my fingers made me irrationally disgusted with my whole skinny body , and disgust is a cold bedfellow for desire . " Please tell me what 's wrong , Toddy , " Jane pleaded . " I really do n't want to hurt you . " ( There was more to this than ordinary solicitude , as I realized next day when she announcedthe Italian trip . ) I assured her that I was n't offended  --  after the first few minutes I really was n't  --  but both her curiosity and her desire had to go unsatisfied . I got up , smoked a cigarette , went to bed , tossed and turned , sat up and read , drank another drink , and tossed and turned some more . Jane finally fell asleep , annoyance and injured pride still pouting from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow and got out of bed , resolved , since sleep was impossible , to work on the Inquiry . My mood was black ; I had little patience with my work . It is only in very weak moments like this that I call my project silly ; I sat for an hour in the window , looking down at the Post Office and thinking how incomparably silly my thirteen years ' work was . How silly , for that matter , was my whole life during those thirteen years  --  one feeble mask after an-other ! Ah , there was a symptomatic thought : it was , I think , the first time I 'd ever used the term masks in referring to what I 'd always considered to be the stages of my intellectual development . Moreover , it was not the thought of a cynic , for as soon as it lodged in my consciousness it sent out quick rootlets of despair to all corners of my mind . Indeed , as I vaguely recognized at the time , it was a sign that the mask of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mask  --  was wearing thin , was no longer doing its job . If it were , would I even have thought of my heart ? And suddenly my heart filled my entire body , even myp248head ; it was not my heart that would burst , but my body , so full was it of my heart , and every beat was sick . Surely it would fail ! I clapped my hand quickly to my chest , feeling for the beat ; clutched at the window frame to keep from falling in my dizziness ; stared at nothing , my mouth open , like a fish on the beach . And this not in pain , but in despair ! Here is what I saw : that all my masks were half-conscious attempts to master the fact with which I had to live ; that none had made me master of that fact ; that where cynicism had failed , no future mask could succeed ; that , in short , my heart was the master of all the rest of me , even of my will . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my will . Do n't be so shallow as to suggest that I should have seen a doctor at once to verify my ailment : even this night , when I was far less reasonable than I was next day , I sensed , althoughnot articulately , that to do so was to evade the question . The dilemma was a genuine one either way , and as I 've said earlier , it is my bad luck that I tend to attribute to abstract ideas a life-or-death significance . And the conclusion that swallowed me in its overwhelming despair was this : There is no way to master the fact with which I live . Futility gripped me by the throat ; my head was tight . The impulse to raise my arms and eyes to heaven was almost overpowering  --  but there was no one for me to raise them to . It was a draining , grinding flood , this feeling ; all I could do was clench my jaw , squint my eyes as though in pain , and shake my head from side to side . But every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every new feeling with its private hopelessness , until a battery of little agonies attacked me from all sides , each drawing its strength from the great agony within me . I ca n't say for how long I sat paralyzed by my despair before the more dramatic of its manifestations appeared . What finally happened , when I had become sufficiently demoralized , was that my nerves , fatigued already , succumbed to thep249unusual strain imposed on them . My body was suddenly quite soaked in icy perspiration , and I trembled from head to foot . So deteriorated was my moral and intellectual strength that I came closer than I 'd come for fifteen years to invoking the aid of a God whose nonexistence I 'd long ago assumed , for mine was a despair that drives men to temples , churches , and messiahs , to any crutch within their grasp . Indeed , I ca n't find it in me to deny that , had no other crutch been available , I should very possibly have ended that night on my knees , laying my integrity on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within reach : Jane , now sleeping soundly . And the embarrassment that I feel at telling you how I went shocked and trembling to the bed ; how I buried my head blindly , desperately , against her ; how I lay there until sleep found me , shuddering , my knees clasped to my chest , fighting despair as one fights appendicitis  --  this embarrassment is not different from that I 'd feel at having to confess that I 'd buried myself in God . I am in truth embarrassed , reader , but in good faith I recommend this refuge to your attention . There is nothing in it of the foolish ostrich , because the enemy you flee is not exterior to yourself . And you will be safe . I have no idea whether Jane was aware of any of this . At the tick of six I popped awake ; my head was on the pillow , Jane 's on my right shoulder . In great wisdom I inhaled deeply the smell of her hair , always sunshine and salt ; there have been no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still at 6:00 A.M. I can summon to my nostrils the smell of Jane Mack . I sat up and looked around me , bursting with incipient wisdom . What had been the problem I 'd buried ? As was my habit , before I got up I reached to the window sill for my Sherbrook , took a good pull , and shuddered all over , but no answer came . I rose carefully from the bed , so as not to wake Jane , donned my seersucker suit , splashed cold water on my face  --  and realized that on this day I would destroy myself.  | " Of course ! " I grinned at my dripping face in the mirror  --  dumb , stunned surprise . There was the end of masks ! " Of course ! " There was no mastering the fact with which I lived ; but I could master the fact of my living with it by destroying myself , and the result was the same  --  I was the dictator . I choked back a snicker . " For crying out loud ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " reason " for valuing anything . Now I added including life , and at once the next propositionwas clear : IV . Living is action in some form . There is no reason for action in any form . V. There is , then , no " reason " for living . This last statement merited some minutes of **27;9793;TOOLONG , after which I capped my pen and clipped it in my pocket , put Eustacia 's letter where Jimmy could easily find it , fetched my straw , and left my room without a shred of regret . My Inquiry was closed.  |p251XXVII  . Will you smile at my rowboat ? Ideally , a new philosophical position , like a new rowboat , should be allowed to sit for a day or two at the dock , to let the seams swell tight , before it is put to any strenuous application . But not always is it possible to arrange such a period . It was close to eight o'clock when I left my room , and the boat-show was due to begin at eight-thirty . Let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his importantones , there are always , doubtless , a complexity of reasons , some conscious and some unconscious . And so with my decision to end my life . Smile if you will at the notion that a man can commit suicide on philosophical grounds  --  I 've no objection to anyone 's smiling at a floating opera ! Point , if you 've a psychoanalytic bent , to my motherless boyhood , my murder of the German sergeant , my father 's hanginghimself , my isolated adulthood , my ailing heart , my growingsexual impotency , injured vanity , frustrated ambition , boredom  --  the analyst always has causes aplenty !  --  and say , " These ( or some combination thereof ) are the real causes . " They 're all there ; take your pick . Even I began by deciding to destroy myself as a last means of coming to terms with my heart , and I sha n't deny that any one of the items in thatp252shabby catalogue above may have played its special little secret role . But by the time I closed my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was the philosophicalone ; other reasons , even my heart , were by that time no longer conscious reasons . " So what ? " smiles the analyst . " Nonetheless they 're the real ones . " But I say that a man 's conscious reasons , the causes he thinks lie behind his acts , are not without importance , and I do n't mean symptomatic importance . In fact , when you begin to speak of what a man should or should n't do , they 're the only ones that count . Ethics can necessarily concern itself only with conscious motivation . Psychic determinism rules out choice , and with choice goes ethics : a man ca n't be held responsible for acts for which he 's not responsible , in other words . When you speak of ethics , only conscious reasons are valid reasons ( validity and truth , to be sure , do not necessarilyattach to the same statement ) . And because since my conversation with Mr. Haecker I was interested only in whether a man ( in this case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether he would or would n't ( an analyst 's interest ) , I was interested only in the abstract ideas involved , not in any more personal , biographical considerations . So while it may be foolish to assert that anyone , even Socrates , ever killed himself for purely philosophical reasons ( perhaps he was too timid or vain , subconsciously , to go along with Crito 's plan to spring him ? ) , nevertheless I should call it equally foolish to deny that a man 's interest in his own suicide can be purely philosophical ; that so far as he is concerned , the philosophical reasons are the only important ones . Do you see what I mean ? Psychoanalyze a man as you will , but do n't hold it against him if he is merely bored by your analysis . And tell him , smiling , that his philosophy is no more than a rationalization of the truth ; he can reply , withp253equal claim to God 's ear , that your psychoanalysis is no less a rationalization of the truth . The truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave a grunt or two , and hocked some vagrant phlegm into one of his handkerchiefs . " Are ye goin ' to the boat-show , Toddy ? " " Yes , sir . " " I 'll jest walk along with ye , if ye do n't mind . Ai n't seen a boat-show for years . " He chuckled . " Young Haecker  --  I call ' im Young Haecker now  --  haw ! Young Haecker 's been gloomin ' around so much lately I figured I better have me some fun while I can . All set , boy ? " " Where is Young Haecker ? " " Oh , he ai n't goin ' , " Capt . Osborn sniffed . " He 's too old for such carryin ' - on ! I ai n't seen ' im since this mornin ' . Here , look , I got somethin ' for ye . " Smiling broadly , he withdrew from his pocket a pint of Southern Comfort , which he presented to me . " There , now ! " " What 's this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sniffing appreciatively . The old man blushed slightly . " I owe it to ye , " he said , " for a couple o ' things . That little business we was talkin ' about this mornin ' , for one . " " Come on , then , let 's drink it up , " I said . " You 'll need it as badly as I will , because that particular show 's all over with . " " Shucks , it would o ' been all over anyhow , far 's I 'm concerned , " Capt . Osborn declared righteously . " How about Young Haecker ? " I suggested . " Suppose we cut him in on it , too ? And maybe I can talk him into seeing the boat-show . " I went up to the top floor to Mr. Haecker 's little dormer room and knocked , but he did n't reply . " Mr. Haecker ? " I turned the knob , for it was doubtful thatp254a man of his age and circumstances would be either out or asleep at eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A single tall white candle burned in a brass holder on the writing desk beside the bed , though it was not yet dark , and flickered slightly in the small breeze from the window . Also upon the writing desk , as I saw on approaching it , were an alarm clock stopped at seven forty-five ; a volume of Shakespeare opened to Act Three , Scene One , of Hamlet ( with , believe it or not , the words not all noted in the margin opposite the line Thus conscience does make cowards of us alI ) ; a stack of thirteen fat notebooks each labeled Diary , 19- ( I never had the nerve to examine those ) ; and a glass bottle with two sleeping pills left in it . On the bed Mr. Haecker lay dressed in heavy black silk pajamas , his eyes closed , his arms crossed in the funereal manner of Miss Holiday Hopkinson , next door , his features calm ( composed is a more accurate adjective ) , his pulse and respiration  --  as I discovered upon quickly snatching up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost imperceptible . It was marvelous ! As far as I could see , there was nothing to be done in the way of first aid , and so I simply hurried downstairs and notified Hurley Binder , the night clerk , who in turn very sensibly telephoned the hospital for an ambulance . Then the two of us returned to Mr. Haecker 's room with Capt . Osborn , who pleaded with us to help him up the stairs so that he would n't miss the excitement , and waited for the ambulance to arrive . Hurley Binder and Capt . Osborn clucked their tongues and shook their heads and took generous drinks of the Southern Comfort , mightily impressed by Mr. Haecker 's elaborate preparations for departure . " What d'ye think o ' that ? " Capt . Osborn exclaimed several times . " And him such a educated feller , too ! " From time to time I felt Mr. Haecker 's pulse . He seemed to be losing no ground  --  but then there was little to lose , forp255pulses do not beat much more slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spring Valley , and Mr. Haecker was carted off to the hospital , black silk pajamas and all . " It makes a man stop and think , now , do n't it ? " Capt . Osborn said  --  confident , I doubt not , that he had uttered a meaningful statement . " It does indeed , " I agreed mildly . ' What I thought , at least officially , was that should he live through this foolishness , Mr. Haecker would find the remaining years of his life less burdensome than the ones recently past , because both his former enthusiasm for old age and his apparent present despair of it were , if one judges from exterior appearances , more calculated than thought out , more elaborate than sincere . ( I should enjoy saying that history proved me correct  --  but in fact Mr. Haecker , upon recovering from his generous dose of barbiturates , went from the hospital to a sanitorium in western Maryland , it having been discovered that he was incipiently tubercular , and there , in 1940 , attempted once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with as much flourish as before . This time he was successful . ) " Well , " Capt . Osborne sniffed reverently , " ai n't in our hands now , I guess . Do ye still want to see the show ? " " Why not ? " I shrugged , thinking still of Mr. Haecker : it is always something of a shock to learn that someone has taken your ideas with literally deadly seriousness . " I 'll jest take yer arm , sir , if ye do n't mind . " " Of course . " I led him down the steps . My rowboat , then , for better or worse , was afloat.  |p256Plain  enough by daylight , the Original &; Unparalleled FIoatingOpera was somewhat more ornamented as Capt . Osborn and I approached it across Long Wharf in the hot twilight . Power lines had been run from a utility pole near the dock , and the showboat was outlined in varicolored electric lights , which , however , needed greater darkness for their best effect . On the roof of the theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Chesapeake Maritime Band were installed in their bandstand , rendering , as I recall , " I 'm a Yankee Doodle Dandy " to the crowd of several hundredonlookers gathered around  --  many of whom , particularly among the Negroes , came only to hear the free concert and regard the " Op'ry Barge " with amazement , not having money to spare for admission to the show . The box office was open ( it was nearly showtime ) , and a line was queued up from the ticket window down the gangplank to the bulkheads . Capt . Osborn grew excited and used his cane to nudge small running urchins out of his path , which led unswervinglyto the ticket line . The band wound up George M. Cohan and began , not surprisingly , a Stephen Foster medley . When we reachedp257the top of the gangplank I looked around at the crowd and saw Harrison , Jane , and Jeannine just taking a place in line . Apparently Jeannine was better , or , more probably , Jane had n't had the heart to disappoint her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did n't notice me . The auditorium was already nearly half filled with the citizens of Cambridge . Capt . Osborn and I took seats about seven rows from the rear , on the extreme starboard side of the theater  --  he complaining that we had n't arrived earlier to get really good seats and at the same time looking around for any of his colleagues to whom he could break the news about Mr. Haecker . The hall was illuminated with electric lights , each built into a double fixture along with a gas mantle for use at less progressive landings . Scanning the audience , I saw almost no unfamiliar faces . Col. Morton and his wife sat in the front row on the aisle , the best seats in the house . Marvin Rose , a showboat aficionado , sat a few rows behind . Bill Butler waved cheerily to me from across the theater . My partner Mr. Bishop was there with his wife , whom one seldom saw in public . Harrison , Jane , and Jeannine came in  --  if they saw me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and sat on the other side of the theater . Jimmy Andrews , as I 'd anticipated , was absent  --  doubtless out sailing with his fiancee , for a mild but usable breeze had sprung up earlier in the evening . Above our heads the $7,500 Challenge Band concluded its free concert with " The Star-Spangled Banner . " There was some uncertainty in the house as to whether it was necessary to stand , since the band was outside . Some men made a halfheartedmotion to rise , hesitated , and sat down embarrassed , laughing explanations at their wives with much pointing of fingers toward the roof . Finally Col. Morton stood unfalteringly , without a backward look , and the rest of us followed suit , relieved to have a ruling on the matter . When the anthem ended there was applause from the free-loaders out/side , and much discussion inside about whether it had really been necessary for us to stand . Soon , however , everyone 's attention was focused on the small door under the stage , from which the members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the pit . When all were in their places , and instruments had been tootled cacophoniously , Prof. Eisen himself  --  lean , hollow-cheeked , van-Dyked , intense  --  stepped to the podium amid generous applause from orchestra and balcony , rapped for attention , and raised his baton , on the tip of which the whole house hung . The lights dimmed slightly , the baton fell , and the band crashed into " The Star-Spangled Banner . " An instant 's murmur and then we sprang to our feet again , none more quickly than the Colonel  --  although Evelyn was a trifle flustered . No sooner had the final cymbal clashed than the house lights went out completely and the electric footlights rose , playing on the mauve velvet stage curtain . Prof. Eisen 's baton fell again , and the sprightly overture was commenced : a potpourri of martial airs , ragtime , a touch of some sentimentallove ballad , a flourish of buck-and-wing , and a military finale . We applauded eagerly . Captain Jacob Adam himself stepped from behind the curtain , bowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good evenin ' , good evenin ' , friends ! " he cried cheerily . " I ca n't say how happy I am to see ye all here tonight . It does my heart good when the Floatin ' Op'ry comes round Hambrook Light , I 'll tell ye , ' cause I know that means it 's Cambridge ahead , and I tell John Strudge , my calliope man , I say to him , John , ' I say , get up a good head o ' steam , boy , and let 's have Dem Golden Slippers , ' ' cause that there 's Cambridge yonder , ' I says , and ye 'll sail a lot o ' water ' fore ye meet finer folks than ye 'll see aplenty in Cambridge ! ' Now , then ! " We cheered enthusiastically.  | " Well , sir , folks , I 'm glad so many of ye got out tonight , ' cause we got such a fine new show this year I was anxious for all my friends and even my enemies in Cambridge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Guess my friends'Il be in later , " he mumbled loudly , and grinned at once lest we miss the jest  --  but we were alert , and laughed especially loud to reassure him . " Yes , sir , a brand-new line-up this year , folks , from a crackerjack start to a whiz-bang finish ! But before we haul back the curtain and get on with the fun , I 'm afraid I 'll have to disappoint ye just a wee , wee bit . " We murmured sympathy for ourselves . " Now I know ye was just pinin ' to see Miss Clara Mulloy , the Mary Pickford of the Chesapeake , do her stuff in The Parachute Girl . So was I , I got to admit , ' cause no matter how many times in a row I watch Miss Clara jump down in that there par'chute , them legs o ' hers is so durn pretty I ca n't see my fill ! " We laughed more raucously , Capt . Osborn jabbing me in the ribs and exploding with mirthful phlegm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has caught a germ from someplace  --  must have been Crisfield , could n't of been Cambridge applause !  --  and I swear if she ai n't got the laryngitisso bad she ca n't say a durn word ! " We voiced our disappointment , some of us resentfully . " I know , I know , " Capt . Adam sympathized . " I feel like walkin ' out myself  --  hey , Miss Clara , " he shouted into the wings , " come on out here and show the people yer  --  ah  --  yer Iaryngitis ! " He winked at us , we roared , and then Miss Clara Mulloy  --  brown-haired , brown-eyed , trimly corseted  --  curtsiedonto the stage , the sequins flashing on her black gown , a red flannel scarf tied incongruously around her white neck . She curtsied again to our ovation , pointed to her throat , and moved her lips in silent explanation , while Captain Adam looked on adoringly.  | " What do ye say ? " he cried to us . " Shall we call the whole thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " we shouted , almost as one man  --  two or three rowdies cried " Yes ! " but we glared them down . " Do I hear yes ? " the Captain asked . " NO ! " we roared again , our stares defying contradiction from the one or two hoodlums who are forever spoiling honest folks ' fun . " No ! " we pleaded , hoping Capt . Adam would n't judge us citizens of Cambridge by our most unfortunateelement . " Yes ! " one of the incorrigibles snickered . " That man should be thrown out ! " I heard the Colonel declare in exasperation . " Well , I say let 's be fair and square , " Capt . Adam said . " Any man , woman , or child that wants to leave can get up right now and go , and John Strudge 'll give ye yer full admissionmoney back at the box office , despite ye already heard the overture ! " We laughed at this last and applauded his generosity . The house lights came up for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , then , let 's get on with the show ! " The house lights were extinguished , Miss Clara Mulloy rewarded our applause with a blown kiss ( her eyes dewy ) , Prof. Eisen struck up a lively tune , and we relaxed again . " Now , then , " the Captain announced . " Instead o ' The Parachute Girl I 'm proud to present the great T. Wallace Whittaker , one o ' the finest singers and actors that ever trod the boards , yes sirree ! Ye all know T. Wallace Whittaker as the great Southern tenor  --  got a voice sweet as a honeycomb in a sweet-gum stump , by Joe ! But what ye probably do n't know is that T. Wallace Whittaker is one o ' the best Shakespearianactors in the U.S.A. , or England too , for that matter ! Ladies and gentlemen , I have the great honor to present T. Wallace Whittaker , the eminent tragedian , in scenes from the Bard ! "  |p261Uncertain  applause . The band played some heavy chords in a minor key , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor ( first set for The Parachute Girl ) , in the center of which stood T. Wallace Whittaker , bowing low . He was a clean-cut , slightly broad-beamed , rather Sundayschoolyyoung man , and he wore a tight black Hamletlookingoutfit . From the tone of his very first words  --  a lofty " I shall begin by reciting the famous speech of the duke Jacques , from Act Two of As You Like It "  --  he lost the sympathy of us men , although some wives nodded knowingly . T. Wallace walked to the footlights , struck a declamatory pose , and closed his eyes for a moment . He did not clear his throat , but some of us cleared ours . " All the world 's a stage , " he declared , " and all the men and women merely players . They have their exits and their entrances , and one man in his time plays many parts .... " Already Capt . Osborn had the fidgets , and began ticking his cane against his high-top shoe . The rest of us sat uncomfortablyas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . . . Last scene of all . . . mere oblivion , sans teeth , sans eyes , sans taste , sans everything ! " Polite applause , especially from the ladies . I thought I heard Jeannine ask shrilly for more popcorn , but it could have been some other child . One of the rowdies made a sneering remark that I could n't catch , but that set his neighborschuckling , no longer so hostile to him as before , and rewarded him with a scornful flash of T. Wallace Whittaker'seyes . " Mark Antony 's funeral oration , from Act Three of Julius Caesar , " he announced . " Friends , Romans , countrymen , Iend me your ears .... " " Ye can have mine , boy , " the hoodlum said loudly . " I 've took enough ! " He stalked out of the theater , and the rest ofp262us , instead of being angry , were shamefully amused . Even some wives stifled smiles , but T. Wallace Whittaker went on , blushing furiously , to inflame an imaginary mob against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. Wallace went through the whole routine of reading Caesar 's will . By the time he insinuated his desire to move the stones of Rome to rise and mutiny , his audience was on the verge of doing likewise ; we were tapping our feet , sneezing , and whispering among ourselves . When he cried at the end , " Mischief , thou art afoot ; take thou what course thou wilt ! " someone whistled shrilly and flung a handful of pennies onto the stage . T. Wallace ignored the insult ; rather , he acknowledged it with a defiant glare at us , but refused to be bowed . " What I shall recite now , " he said grimly , " is the most magnificent thing in the whole English language . I sha n't expect a noisy rabble to appreciate its beauty , but perhaps a respectful silence will be granted , if not to me , at least to Shakespeare ! " " Where 's the minstrels ? " someone yelled . " Bring on the minstrels ! " More pennies sailed over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallace Whittaker almostwhispered . " Go home ! " " Take ' im away ! " " Come on , minstrels ! " " To be , or not to be : that is the question .... " " Ya  --  a  --  a  --  ab ! " The audience was really quite out of hand now . Severalyoung men stood on their chairs to take better aim with theirpennies , which no longer merely fell at T. Wallace 's feet , but struck his face , chest , and gesticulating arms until he wasforced to turn half around ; but he would not be vanquished . " To die , to sleep : to sleep : perchance to dream : ay , there'sthe rub .... " One pimply-faced lad , standing in a front-row seat , beganp263aping T. Wallace 's gestures , to our great delight , until Col. Morton struck at him with his gold-headed cane . " For who would bear the whips and scorns of time , the oppressor 's wrong . . . " T. Wallace Whittaker was determined , come what might , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... the proud man 's contumely , the pangs of dispriz 'd love , the law 's delay . . . " " Yahoo ! Boo ! H  --  s  --  s  --  s  --  s  --  s ! " It was open warfare now ; T. Wallace could no longer be heard , but nevertheless he continued undaunted . Capt . Adam appeared from the wings , greatly disturbed lest we begin taking the vessel apart , but we greeted his conciliatory wavings with more boos . He went to T. Wallace , doubtless to ask him to call it a day , but T. Wallace paid him no heed , and declaimed right in his face . Capt . Adam grew panicky , then angry , and tried to drag him off by force , but T. Wallace shoved him roughly away , still gesticulating with the other hand . Capt . Adam shook his finger at the young man , shouted , " Yer fired ! " and signaled to Prof. Eisen to strike up the band . The $7,500 Challenge Maritime Band waltzed into " Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains , and shaking both fists at us through a copper shower ( to which I , too , contributed , standing up and flinging all my change at him ) , in blind defiance he screamed : " Thus conscience does make cowards of us all ; and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought ! " Finished at last , he scooped a handful of pennies from the stage , flung them back at us with all his strength , and disappeared behind the curtain . A few more late-thrown pennies sailed after him , hitting the curtain and clicking onto the stage . We were all laughing and comparing notes , a little sheepish , but exhilarated for all that  --  none more so than I , for it is often pleasant to stone a martyr , no matter how much we may admire him.  |p264For  my part , as I believe I 've mentioned elsewhere in this book , I 'm seldom reluctant to assist in my small way in the persecution of people who defy the crowd with their principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles . After all , the test of one 's principles is his willingness to suffer for them , and the test of this willingness  --  the only test  --  is actual suffering . What was I doing , then , but assisting T. Wallace ' Whittaker in the realization of his principles ? For now , surely , having been hooted from the stage and fired from his job in the cause of Shakespeare , he would either abandon his principles , in which case they were n't integrated very strongly into his personality , or else cling to them more strongly than ever , in which case he has us to thank for giving him the means to strength . Capt . Adam appeared next from the wings , smiling thinly , and raised his hands . We were willing enough now to be silent , having made our point . " Oh , well , who likes Shakespeare anyhow ? " He shrugged cravenly , kicking a few pennies around the footlights . " If ye think yer gittin ' any o ' these pennies back , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as wayward children who learn that they wo n't be punished after all . " Now , then , see if ye ca n't be a little nicer to the next folks , " Capt . Adam grinned . " At least pitch quarters at ' em . Ladies and gents : those knights of the burnt cork , the U.S.A. 's greatest sable humorists , the chaste and inimitable Ethiopian Tidewater Minstrels ! " We applauded complacently , for this was what we 'd come to see . Prof. Eisen ripped into " I 'm Alabammy Bound " at an express-train tempo , and the curtains parted . The set for The Parachute Girl had been replaced by a solid blue backdrop , against which stood out shockingly the bright uniforms of a small semicircle of minstrels . There were six in all : three on each side of Capt . Adam , who took his place as interlocutor . All wore fuzzy black wigs , orange clawhammer coats ,  |p265bright  checkered vests and trousers , tall paper collars , and enormous shoes , and sang in raucous unison the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the interlocutor assisted the effort with banjos and guitars , while Tambo and Bones , the end men , played the instruments from which their names are derived . With a great rattling and crashing the tune shuddered to its end . " Gentle-men-n-n-n . . . " cried Capt . Adam , raising his arms to heaven , " BE . . . SEATED ! " Tambo and Bones , to be sure , missed their chairs and fell sprawling on the floor , accompanied by thumps from the bass drum . Knees were slapped , ribs elbowed . Capt . Osborn , besideme , strangled rapturously . Col. Morton 's cane banged approval . In his new role as Mr. Interlocutor , Capt . Adam was suddenly transformed into an entirely different person  --  grammatical , florid , effusive  --  so that one doubted the authenticityof his original character . When the end men , great eyeballs rolling , had regained their seats , the classical repartee ensued , the interlocutor being tripped up in his pomposity again and again  --  to our delight , for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bones . ( " Good evening , Mr. Tambo ; you look a little down in the mouth tonight . " " Mist ' Interlocutor , ah ai n't down in de mouf ; ah 's down in de pocketbook .

Ah , there 's a wise lad , Tambo ! No schoolboy should be without a good encyclopedia . I trust you 'll purchase one for the lad ? " " No , sah ! " " No ! " " No , sah ! Ah say to dat boy , ah say , " Cyclopedia nuffin ' ! Y'all gwine walk like de other chillun !

Joke followed elephantine joke : Negroes were shiftless and ignorant ; foreigners were suspect ; the WPA was a refuge for loafers ; mothers-in-law were shrewish ; women were poor drivers ; drunkenness was an amusing but unquestionedvice ; churchgoing a soporific but unquestioned virtue . Tambo and Bones , being uneducated and lazy and dark , deservedtheir poverty , but their rascality won our hearts , and we nodded to one another as their native wit led the overeducated , pontifical interlocutor into one trap after another . Tambo and Bones vindicated our ordinariness ; made us secure , even smug , in the face of mere book learning ; their every triumph over Mr. Interlocutor was a pat on our backs , a reassurance . Indeed , a double reassurance : for were not Tambo and Bones , our champions against intellectuality , but irresponsible Negroes ? Superior to the interlocutor , to be sure , but we solid , responsible citizens ( down here in the orchestra )  --  we were superior to all . Good is good , bad is bad ; and the good wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is punished ; and we are so agreed on the obvious meanings of those terms that to question us about them would be impertinent , sir ! We were sung to of heart , hearth , and home by Sweet Sally Starbuck , the singing soubrette , she of the moist eyes , corn-silk hair , and flushed cheeks . What did she sing us ? " I Had a Dream , Dear . " " After the Ball Is Over . " " A Mother 's Prayer for Her Son . " " Harvest Moon . " ( " Y'all so smaht , Mist ' Interlocutor , ansah me dis , sah : whut got twenty-nine legs , six arms , twelve ears , three tails , twenty feet , and a passle ob faucets , and say cockadoodle-doo ?
