Mohammed Mossadegh decided that the time had come to act . His top lieutenants crammed themselves into two Chevrolets and drove out of Teheran to a rendezvous at the summer home of Hussein <P> Makki , Mossadegh 's fiery No. 1 aide . They were determined to get Mossadegh back into office , and to oust wealthy and adroit old Premier Ahmed Qavam ( TIME , July 28 ) . But how ? <P> For five frantic hours they considered and rejected proposals . Qavam might be assassinated-but he was a hard man to get a shot at . They might stir up tribal revolts-but that would take too long . Finally , they agreed on a desperate , dangerous move : invite the Red toughs of the outlawed ( Communist ) Tudeh Party - whom they knew by bitter experience to be militant and well led-to fight in the street alongside them , against the army and the police . Makki summed up the instructions : " Launch a series of violent demonstrations no matter what their outcome-even revolution . " The first was scheduled for Monday , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the young Shah yielded . <P> Chaos broke out as planned . Teheran , a city of 1,000,000 population , was paralyzed by a general strike . Mobs threatened the Majlis , fired government jeeps , and hurled stones at the troops and police , who replied with tear gas and gunfire . At least 20 persons , and perhaps many more , were killed . The Communists linked arms with members of the pro-fascist Pan-Iranian and Sumka parties and led the rioters in chanting a new slogan : " Down with the Traitor Shah . " But by late afternoon the exhausted demonstrators began trickling back to their hovels . <P> The Weak Shah . Qavam moved to counterattack . He hurried to the Shah , proposed that the Majlis be dissolved , and outlined plans to jail the mob leaders . At this point , the fight for Iran might have gone either way . But the attacks on the monarchy had scared the Shah ; moreover , he feared , and not without reason , that Qavam 's vigorous measures might cause defections in the army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Old Fox Qavam resigned the premiership ; he could do nothing else . He hurried into hiding , and at week 's end was still safe , though mobs cried for his head and the Parliament threatened to strip him of his fortune . As the news of Qavam 's downfall spread , 72-year-old Mossadegh stepped out on his balcony , sobbed to the mob : " Your sacrifice today saved the country , " and fainted . <P> The next day , the weepy , faint-prone old man was back in power . He had beaten Qavam and the Shah , who now gave Mossadegh the War Ministry he had earlier denied him . And he had beaten the British , even if his victories had left his country near anarchy and his people impoverished .
