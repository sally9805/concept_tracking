Omnibus ( Sundays , 4:30 p.m. , CBS-TV ) dedicates an hour and a half to " exceedingly various " experiences in the arts and skills . The show is aimed , says Spokesman Alistair Cooke , at middlebrow audiences . What gives the program its theoretical latitude is the fact that it was designed ( and is supported ) by the Ford Foundation , whose object is not money but an attempt to exploit new TV horizons . The first show of the series set the pace for the future : two original plays ( The Badmen , by William Saroyan , and The Trial of Anne Boleyn , by Maxwell Anderson ) ; excerpts from The Mikado , with Britain 's famed Martyn Green ; two short films ( Witch Doctor , an authentic Haitian dance with Jean Leon Destine , and clips from an X-ray movie ) . <P> Spokesman Cooke , famed for his BBC broadcasts from the U.S. , strolls from experience to experience , doing his urbane best to lace a heterogeneous program together . Once minor production flaws are cleared up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informative shows in television . This week 's second production gave proof of the hope . The bill was tighter , better edited and smaller . There were fewer features , including Menotti 's miniature opera , The Telephone , and the first of a five-part Abraham Lincoln story written by James ( The Quiet One ) Agee and directed by Documentary Producer Louis de Rochemont . New experiences forthcoming : Helen Hayes in J. M. Barrie 's The Twelve-Pound Look ; Metropolitan Opera productions . <P> My Hero ( Saturdays , 7:30 p.m. , NBCTV ) stars Cinemactor Robert Cummings in a filmed series about Robert Beanblossom , a bumbling real-estate salesman who is " a sort of likable jerk . " He sets the tone of the leading character in the first show as he barely holds to his job and desperately tries to earn some commissions ( " Even my friends are making more money than I am , and they 're unemployed " ) . The gags are broad ( Cummings to a vamp : " Be careful , I 'm already committed . " Vamp to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm through with you " ) , and so is all the acting , but there are plenty of simple-minded laughs . The Bob Hope Show ( weekdays , 9:30 a.m. , NBC ) is designed strictly for housewives who want something to laugh at over their vacuum cleaners before tuning in the soap operas . Hope handles the job in snappy style ( before a live audience of ladies ) , dots the radio program with interviews and a weekly " guest lady editor , " e.g. , Zsa Zsa Gabor , Cobina Wright Sr.
