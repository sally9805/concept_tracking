" A blow on the nose to British surgery , " harrumphed an anonymous British doctor , quoted in London 's Sunday Express , when Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden 's physicians announced that their distinguished patient would fly to Boston to be operated on by the Lahey Clinic 's Dr. Richard Cattell . Actually , the decision represented no skin off anybody 's nose . With an admirable lack of professional jealousy , Eden 's British doctors recognized that the Foreign Secretary , still ailing after two operations in London , needed a specialized skill which Dr. Cattell had developed as highly as any surgeon in the world . And the best place for Dr. Cattell to operate was on his home ground . <P> At the start , Anthony Eden 's trouble seemed simple enough . He had stones in the gall bladder . This organ does nothing but store up the liver 's output of bile at times when the bile is not needed for digestion , and the human body can get along fine without it . So on April 12 , Surgeon Basil Hume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bladder . After the operation , the common bile duct , the tube which carries bile to the digestive tract , was partly obstructed . It may have been damaged during surgery . This would be no reflection on Surgeon Hume , for part of the operation has to be done " blind " under inches of body tissues . The duct may have been misshapen to begin with , or the trouble may have developed during healing . <P> More surgery on the 56-year-old patient was called for . Bile kept backing up into his bloodstream and caused jaundice . So Surgeon Hume had to operate on his patient again on April 29 to do a patching job . However , as happens about once in every four such cases , the patching operation also failed . Unless his bile duct could be completely repaired , Anthony Eden would be doomed to chronic invalidism . <P> By happy chance , the Lahey Clinic 's Dr. Cattell was lecturing in London when Eden 's doctors faced their dilemma . He has specialized in repairing troublesome bile ducts . Dr. Cattell examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . But , he explained , it would be far better for him to do it in his own theater with a staff of anesthetists and nurses who work smoothly with him after years of practice . <P> Eden was adjudged fit to fly , and last week he landed at Boston in a special Canadian government plane . By the Britons ' own estimates , Eden would have had only a 50-50 chance of full recovery from this third operation if even the best British surgeon had done it , but at Dr. Cattell 's more practiced hands his chance was rated at 70-30.
