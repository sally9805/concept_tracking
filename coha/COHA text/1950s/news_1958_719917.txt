txt The Supreme Court on Aug. 25 hurriedly ordered one of its rare special sessions for Aug , 28 , to consider the Little Rock , Ark. , school segregation case . With an eye on the calendar , Chief Justice Earl Warren called the high court back from summer vacation to step into the touchy case just five days before schools reopen in Little Rock on Sept. 2 . Just a year ago , violence erupted when nine Negroes enrolled in Little Rock 's Central high School under a federal court order for racial integration . Before the nine Supreme Court justices when they take the bench at noon Aug. 28 will be an application of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People asking the court to overrule a federal district court at Little Rock which granted a 21/2-year delay in desegregation . The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals at St. Louis issued an order voiding this delay , but then granted a stay of its order until the Supreme Court could rule . The NAACP also wants this stay voided.     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
