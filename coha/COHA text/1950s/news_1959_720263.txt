A prompt reply to Mr. Levitt 's attack came from Dr. T. Norman Hurd , the Governor 's Budget Director . He accused the Controller of " careless misrepresentation of the state 's finances . " The prospects for a modification of the Governor 's proposals ' for lowering income-tax exemptions were rising rapidly with an increase in the Republican legislators publicly opposing them . The terms of a compromise may be formulated Sunday at a conference of Republican legislative leaders with their ) budgetary and tax advisers . Governor Rockefeller was reported by one highly placed Republican leader to be reconciled to some modification despite public statements that his proposals leave no room for compromise . Controller Levitt 's criticism a the Rockefeller program was made on a state-wide television and radio program originating in New York . It was carried over Station WABC-TV , Channel 7 , from 6:30 to 6:45 P. M. It was repeated over some upstate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried the Governor 's talk last week carried the Levitt program . Mr. Levitt spoke as the only Democrat elected to state-wide administrative office last fall . His talk was in answer to Governor Rockefeller 's explanation and defense of his program over the same facilities last week . The two Democratic leaders of the Legislature , Senator Joseph Zaretzki of Manhattan and Assemblyman Anthony J. Travia of Brooklyn , are to reply over the same facilities tomorrow to Mr. Rockefeller 's second television appearance last week . The Controller concentrated on the impact of the Rockefeller program on families with incomes of $5,000 or less . ' The Governor says that his tax program will only take a few additional pennies a day from these people , " he remarked . " Well , let 's see what these additional pennies mean to a family of four living on $3,500 a year . " This family would pay $4 yearly in income tax ; now they pay nothing . If they use a pack ' of cigarettes a day , they will pay an additional $7.30 iri taxes . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more in taxes . " If the man of the ? house wishes to continue to hunt and fish  --  and there are over 1,500 , - 000 such men in New York State ? he will pay $2 more a year . The total then , that Governor Rockefeller is asking this family for is not a few additional pennies but $26.60 a year . " What does $26.60 a year mean to a family of four with $3,500 income ? It may be pennies to some people but it is three days ' pay to this family .

The present exemptions , ! amounting to $1,000 for a single taxpayer , $2,500 for a married couple and $400 for each dependent , were established in 1932 , he emphasized : Two other phases of the Governor 's program were attacked by Mr. Levitt . One was the proposal to forgive all income taxes on capital gains made in 1958 along with taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would amount to a $33,000 , - 000 gift to a few persons . The other was the proposal to put the state on a pay-as-you-go basis with respect to major construction projects . " As a citizen and a taxpayer , you and I know that ninetynine out of a hundred of us would never own a home on a pay-as-you-go basis , " he remarked . - In his reply , Dr. Hurd said Mr. Levitt had " done the people of New York a great disservice by his careless misrepresentation of the state 's finances and his advocacy of greater spending and greater borrowing . " As Controller , Dr. Hurd noted , Mr. Levitt sold $430,000,000 in , state bonds over the last four years . The interest on these , he remarked , amounts to $11,600 , - 000 a year , more than the state is spending for emergency school construction aid and a number of other costs . Assembly Speaker Oswald D. Heck was reported to be taking the lead in seeking a compromise in lowered exemptions that will be acceptable to the Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Heck returned only yesterday from a Boston hospital where he had undergone surgery on his left foot . He appears well on his way to a complete recovery . Today he entertained Governor Rockefeller at luncheon in his hotel suite . Six additional Republican assemblymen took public positions against lowered exemptions during the day . They were the five from Erie County , the home of Senator Walter J. Mahoney , the ! Senate majority leader , and ' Edwyn E. Mason of Delaware County . The two from Staten Island , three from Onondaga and one from Orange had previously indicated their opposition . At least five others are expected to join the opposition shortly . Seventeen defections in the Assembly are enough to defeat the proposal , since the entire Democratic membership is committed to vote against any proposal to lower exemptions .

The five Republican Assemblymen from Erie said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . According to their computations , the state would forego $65,000,000 in revenue by leaving exemptions where they are : In a separate statement the three Republican assemblymen and two Republican senators from Onondaga declared that the Governor 's program " requires tax increases possibly beyond the taxpayers ' ability to pay . " The Onondaga group suggested budget cuts amounting to $86,000,000 . Among them was the elimination or deferral of the Governor 's recommendaitibn that state aid to New York City be increased by $15,000,40.
