Cambridge , Mass.ELIOT JANEWAY. pg . 215 Letters to the Book Review Editor Mobilization &; Inflation TO THE EDITOR : ONE who himself , on occasion , ventures on the increasingly hazardous task of reviewing books should not , I think ever cast a doubt on the infallibility of reviewers . Destroy this presumption and verily there will be chaos or worse . Matters become even more difficult when a reviewer takes issue with a review by an author whose book he has recently reviewed , which is my present task . Yet Mr. Eliot Janeway ( who as the author of " Struggle for Survival " was the good-humored object or victim of a comment of mine a few weeks ago ) has , in his extremely severe attack on Prof. Seymour E. Harris ' " The Economics of Mobilization and Inflation . " raised some economic questions of grew importance in our time Janeway charges Harris . and by implication numerous other economists " with excessive preoccupation with the purely financial aspects of mobilization . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that we get rid of the restraints imposed by " the silly , foolish old dollar sign . " It did not occur to me , on reading Harris ' book , that he was nearly as preoccupied with purely financial issues as his critic suggests . The first eighty-odd pages deal with the supply and use of real resources in manpower , materials and farm products and he observes that : " Acquisition of supplies and manpower by the military is the number one problem * * * . " But conceding that he places considerable emphasis on economic and financial questions , and assuming also that a division of labor operates here as elsewhere , I can not think such emphasis unfortunate . When Roosevelt delivered his famous homily there was a popular belief that a limit was set on the arms we could buy by a limit on the money we could raise . This belief has long since been dispelled  --  indeed . Harris was one of the economists who helped dispel it . HOWEVER , having learned that dollars are not a limiting factor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management is unimportant . It is with such management that Harris is concerned . Janeway is no doubt right in saying that the stability of the ruble is a datum of minor importance on Russian strength . But given the considerable differences between the two economies the stability of the dollar is not a minor matter . Perhaps we could arm and remain armed with a radically depreciating dollar , but it would surely be a dangerous experiment . * * * Mr. Janeway is also premature in dismissing a pay-as-yougo policy , designed to mop up excess purchasing power , as not even " remotely possible . " For the fiscal year 1951-52 , by recent Department of Commerce estimates , the deficit on an expenditure of 569 billions will be only four billion and when receipts on social security account are added in , the result is an approximate balance between total income and outgo . During the year following , expenditures will be higher but so will revenues . Finally , Mr. Janeway characterizes Harris ' *advocacy of the foregoing policy , with minimum reliance on direct controls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - I must say that I am astonished at the number and variety of ideas that are currently being traced to Keynes . In this instance it makes all who seek to avoid or minimize reliance on deficit financing into Keynesians which has the unfortunate effect of making the great majority of economists who preceded Keynes ( who would certainly have advocated such a policy ) into Keynesians . But there is a more important point here . Economists have not lost their ability to think for themselves ; they do not forever travel like fish in schools . * * * J. K. GALBRAITH . Cambridge , Mass . A Reply To THE EDITOR : WHAT I found so shockingly inadequate about Professor Harris ' latest book was its failure to come to grips with the fundamental problem of mobilization ? the organization of production . Strategic shortages of materials and facilities have combined to dislocate production . Consequently , we must now reckon with the facts of production in physical , not financial , terms , and we must recognize that specific physical capacities and administrative decisions today control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any classical economist ever assumed a market could . Dollar signs are no longer shorthand for production schedules . Congress may appropriate money for production , and Messrs . Harris and Galbraith may measure and control the rate at which it is spent and taxed back , but they will not give us one more jet engine than the supply of nickel and tungsten and cobalt and columbium and the utilization of machine tools will turn out . * * Professor Harris does devote fifty-seven ( not eighty-odd ) of his 287 pages to what he thinks is an approach to the realities of " resources for mobilization . " But in these pages he confines himself ( with minor exceptions , generally inaccurate ) to shallow generalities about dollars as if to do this/is to shed light on the endless problems * * harassing our dislocated production schedules . It does nothing of the kind , * * * My friend and former colleague , Professor Galbraith , in his recent review of my book , characterized himself with disarming candor as " one of the people to whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Friendship makes me more than willing to explain to Galbraith again that my book shows the commanding pres sures of mobilization first came to dominate the familiar tech niques of politics . The same pressures of mobilization also dominate the familiar symbols and assumptions of finance and economics , leaving them at best irrelevant and at worst downright misleading . THE point in question is my criticism of Harris for carrying his neo-Keynesianism to the extreme of believing that taxation alone can close mobilization 's prodigiously expanding inflationary gap . Galbraith says it is about to . More fundamental still , Galbraith accuses me of a kind of ideological neo-McCarthyism in presuming to criticize Harris ' extreme neo-Keynesianism . To assert that taxation can close the inflationary gap is exactly this . Keynes advocated spending against deflation and taxing against inflation . But , as Schumpeter and Harrod have emphasized , Keynes was essentially an improviser , never shrinking from either controversy or self-correction . Neither Harris nor Galbraith seem to recall Keynes ' modification of Keynesianism in " How to Pay for the War " ( page 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be raised by taxes which is not practically possible * * s . " Again , Harrod in his . " Keynes " ( page 318 ) reports that " Keynes propounded the view * * * that no nation will endure paying more than a given percentage of its national income in taxation , and if it has to carry a greater load it will almost automatically find escape from its plight by inflation . " * * The most important question of all is to identify the enemy . Is it . inflation ? Or is it Soviet imperialism ? The price imposed upon us for resolving to defeat Soviet imperialism is that we must be content for a long time to come , to fight a rear-guard action against inflation . Because I assume immeasurably greater inflationary momentum than Harris or Galbraith , and for a much longer time , I subscribe to Baruch 's insistence upon the necessity for direct control over its effects . Given the crisis , its causes can not be rooted out . ELIOT JANEWAY . New York City .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
