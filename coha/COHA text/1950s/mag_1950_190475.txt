Over the 37 miles from Chicago to Aurora , Ill. , the Chicago , Burlington &; Quincy Railroad hauls some 15,000 commuters a day . Some cars are half a century old , draughty in winter , hot and sooty in summer . Last week the Burlington served up a pleasant surprise : it rolled out three new stainless steel , 148-passenger , double-decker cars , the first of 30 being built by Philadelphia 's Budd Co. at a cost of $152,000 each . With them , and 70 modernized conventional cars , the Burlington hopes to wean many a new customer from the highways , put its money-losing commuting service into the black . <P> Supplying money-making equipment to railroads is an old story to the Budd Co. , which sold the first stainless steel streamliner , the Pioneer Zephyr , to the Burlington in 1934 . Since World War II the company has sold some $115 million of railroad equipment , gained such a fat share of the market that it is now second only to Pullman as a railroad passenger-car builder . With the help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenue by making auto bodies , wheels , brakes ) , the company rolled up $137 million in sales for the first six months of 1950 , boosted first half profits 50% up to $11,001,104 . <P> Wheels for Pershing . Making such profits is relatively new to Budd . The late Edward Gowen Budd , who founded the company* 38 years ago , was often willing to toss good profits overboard in order to try a new technological twist . He built the first all-steel auto body for Charles Nash ( then president of G.M. ) in 1912 , made the first U.S. all-steel auto wheel to fit General John J. Pershing 's staff cars during World War I. The manufacturing company expanded with the auto industry to the point where it grossed $24.7 million in 1925 , but it never made much money ( it actually lost $300,000 during the three boom years 1926-29 ) . <P> When the depression flattened the auto business , Budd 's loss snowballed to $1,785,000 . To keep his shopmen busy , Budd began building lightweight railroad passenger cars , using the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets . Roads bought the cars eagerly , but Edward Budd spent money hand over fist experimenting on such products as stainless steel masts for ships . <P> No Long Shots . Budd Sr. died in 1946 and Edward Jr. , who had grown up in the company as tool &; die maker , factory foreman and general manager , took over as president . He cut out the long-shot experimenting on such things as a stainless steel amphibious plane , and concentrated on railroad and auto equipment . Budd became the world 's biggest independent producer of auto body parts , began paying its first regular dividends in 16 years . <P> In the railroad-equipment field , Automan Budd cannily foresaw the end of the postwar rush for long-haul passenger cars , developed the Railway Diesel Car for economical passenger service for shorter runs . Thus , when the railway car market virtually vanished this year , Budd 's foresight paid off : out of 18 passenger car orders placed with U.S. car builders this year , 16 are for Budd 's new " RDCs . " <P> <P> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he founded the independent Budd Wheel Corp. , merged into the present Budd Co. in 1946.
