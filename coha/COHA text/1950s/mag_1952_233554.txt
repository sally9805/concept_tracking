Paris renewed an old and well-remembered friendship . Marie Laurencin , 68 , had her first one-man show in years . One look was enough to convince Paris that Marie still belongs in the inner circle of French moderns and that her touch is as light and pleasure-bent as ever . Said admiring Poet Andre Salmon : " She can paint a girl with eyes like a doe , and a doe with eyes like a girl . " <P> Girls-pretty girls-were the subjects of practically all of Marie Laurencin 's 32 recent oils . There were young girls , teen-age girls , groups of schoolgirls talking , girls dancing , looking demure or just gazing quietly off into space . All had Marie Laurencin 's personal mark : smooth young faces with skimpy noses or none at all , skins the color of pale roses and eyes dark as black cherries . <P> Nowadays Paris critics rank Painter Laurencin roughly on a level with Utrillo and Vlaminck . But there was no such accolade when she first started painting half a century ago . Three times she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and each time she was coldly refused . Critics called her work " decadent , " " ugly , " " without talent . " <P> Marie 's early work showed the influence of Toulouse-Lautrec and of her dabbling in cubism . But World War I took Marie out of her Paris circle for a while ; she had married a German painter , Otto von Watgen , and when the war came along , she and her husband had to leave France . They lived in Spain until 1918 ; then Marie got a divorce and went back to Paris . <P> There she sat herself down and began to paint young girls in a style of her own . The critics suddenly took interest , and soon doting mothers were asking for appointments . Sometimes when commissions were slow , Marie got the concierge 's young daughter to sit for an hour or so ; at other times she just sat by a mirror and painted herself . <P> Marie Laurencin does not paint self-portraits any more . " At my age , " she says , shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She lives alone , and except for an occasional spin around Paris in a bus , she seldom goes out . But the mothers with daughters in tow still come to her . Marie Laurencin shrugs at the thought of landscapes or still lifes : " Why should I paint dead fish , onions and beer glasses ? Girls are so much prettier . "
