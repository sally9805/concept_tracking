txt A reduction in television coverage is being considered as a means for speeding the Senate hearings into the dispute between Senator Joseph R. McCarthy and the Army . The prospect appeared to be tonight that , if other means failed , such a course might win favor with the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations . The members , regardless of party , are dismayed at the slow progress being made ; they began exploring ways to step up the pace last Friday . With the hearings entering the eighth day tomorrow , Robert T. Stevens , the Secretary of the Army , is still on the stand . Senator McCarthy has been heard only as a cross-examiner . There is no indication at this point as to when the Wisconsin Republican may take the stand . The curtailment 0I ? elimination of television coverage will be proposed formally to the subcommittee for discussion at its next executive session , tentatively scheduled for tomorrow afternoon . There already was substantial agreement among subcommittee members that the step should be considered seriously . Up to this point , the group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daily sessions . Rights of Reporting Upheld " I do n't know whether I would vote to cut TV coverage , " said Senator Charles E. Potter , Republican of Michigan , " but the only thing that I can say is that , if hearings were not televised , they would be expedited materially . " Senator Henry C. Dworshak , Republican of Idaho , also thought a cutback might help " if only by discouraging some who otherwise might want to use what should be a news medium for ' publicity purposes . " Like Mr. Potter , Mr. Dworshak felt that the subcommittee in its deliberations should decide whether cutting the coverage would interfere with basic news freedoms and prevent the widespread dissemination of the facts . Both Senator McCarthy and Joseph N. Welch , special counsel to the Army , also were discouraged by the slow pace . Mr. Welch renewed his proposal that , as soon as Mr. Stevens was excused , Senator McCarthy be put on the stand . He said that ) by such a device the hearings " would be speeded up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican of South Dakota and the acting chairman , has noted that Ray H. Jenkins , the special subcommittee counsel , believes this procedure would ) lead only to new delay . Returning to Washington from a week-end at Walpole , Mass. , Mr. Welch insisted that the best way he knew to end a trial was " to call the principal witnesses ) // first . " Secondary witnesses , he said , should be called only to resolve the points in dispute . At Walpole , Mr. Welch had worked on the case with his assistants , James St. Clair and John Kimball . Senator McCarthy , returning from Wisconsin by plane , said he thought it would be very difficult to shorten the hearings . The subcommittee " might be able to finish the hearings about 1970 at the rate we 're going now , " he commented . A prime concern among members of the subcommittee was said to be that the basic issues in the dispute might become lost in the welter of side issues . The main issues are these : The Army contends that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Francis P. Carr , put pressure on the Army in an attempt to get favored treatment for Pvt . G. David Schine . Before his induction , Private Schine , a close friend of Mr. Cohn , worked as an unpaid consultant to the subcommittee . The McCarthy-Cohn-Carr countercharge is to the effect that Private Schine was nothing more than a " hostage " in the hands of the Army , and that the Army sought to use him to force the subcommittee to abandon inquiries into possible Communist infiltration of the service . Senator McCarthy has stepped aside as subcommittee chairman while the dispute is being carried on . He said today that he felt that Sgt , Herbert R. Manchester of the Air Force should be recalled to the stand to repeat under oath the circumstances under which Secretary Stevens had his picture taken with a group including Private Schine . Sergeant Manchester testified Friday that he had ordered an Air Force photographer to take the picture . He was not asked , as the McCarthy side in the controversy has contended , whether it was Secretary Stevens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week-end , Sergeant Manchester said : " I honestly ca n't recall anyone saying , ' I want a picture with so-and-so ' . " Mr. Welch , too , seemed interested in having the ? Air Force sergeant recalled to testify on the subject . Meanwhile , the concern about the pace of the hearings grew . Others in the Senate , seeing a loss of prestige and dignity by both the Executive Branch and the Senate , were far more outspoken than their colleagues on the subcommittee . " The charges ought to be investigated , but I 'm against doing it at a televised vaudeville show , " said Senator Burnet R. Maybank , Democrat of South Carolina . Other Senators shared Mr. Alaybank 's belief that the hearing was " harming the country . " In private conversations members of both parties denounced what they called the " circus , " " hamming , " and " playing the gallery " aroused by televising the hearings . Senator H. Alexander Smith , Republican of New Jersey , said the hearing was " perfectly terrible . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of these hearings , " he declared . " I think this spectacle will hurt the Re ! publican party while the Democrats are feasting . " Sharp criticism of the investigation also was voiced by Senator George D. Aiken , Republican of Vermont . He said many were " watching to see who is going to be skinned without caring I much who it is . " Gov . Allen Shivers of Texas , interviewed on the National ( Broadcasting Company program , " Youth Wants to Know , " said he had " only seen about ten minutes " of the hearings on telivision but believed Senator McCarthy had suffered " a slight loss in popularity " in the proceedings . The Governor objected , though , to having the dispute characterized as " a publi brawl . " " You will find , " he said , " that whenever the public is sufficiently informed , the public generally comes up with the right answer . " Asked by one youngster whether he personally supported Senator McCarthy , the Governor replied : " I support him when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he is wrong , just as I am sure you do .
