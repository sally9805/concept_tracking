there 's a ripe old American legend that the British have no sense of humor  --  or at least that it 's different from ours . In view of this bit of wilt-resistant folklore , it 's a little surprising that one of our favorite comedians is Alec Guinness , an English actor who was practically unknown here a few years ago . Today the Guinness vogue is so great that his name is being approvingly mispronounced in areas that still have not forgi  --  yn King George the Third . In his latest picture , The Bridge on the River Kwai , Guinness has surprised a lot of his American enthusiasts . He plays a humorless British officer , the ranking man in a Japanese prism ' camp , trying with narrow British obstinacy fight a gentleman 's war . It 's a tragic and difficult role that was turned down  --  a , 1.10 " chancey " ? by another very line actor , who may well be kicking himself today It 's always risky to predict how the member% of the Academy of Motion Picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't know anyone in Hollywood who does n't concede an award for Guinness 's sniffy , stuffy colonel . " Alec Guinness has made more friends for Great Britain than any Englishman since Sir Winston Churchill , " says a British consular official in Los Angeles . " The way you people have received him is very gratifying to us . We like him , too ? you know . " The name , by the way , is pronounced " GIN-ness , " with a hard g , as in " gone . " Hard , too , is the way he won his American following , through what television calls OBM 's . This stands for Old British Movies , whichalways get the worst place on the schedule . When a program director has nothing else to put on , and nobody is watching television anyway , he runs OBM 's  --  often at one , two , or three o'clock in the morning . The first two Guinness comedies to he released to TV here were The Lavender Hill Mob and The Man in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? in a job lot of OBM 's , at a price their vendor no doubt regrets poignantly today , considering the hit they made . They have run five or six times in most cities , and are undoubtedly on some television schedule somewhere in the United States this very night . But it was not the viewer of the late , late , late show who discovered Guinness . For years he was the leading star in the little theaters that play European films to the handful of dedicated enthusiasts found in every large city . These people deny that they are " movie fans . " Their taste usually runs to Italian films with low-key lighting and English subtitles , with everyone starving to death in the ruins of a bombed-out house of ill repute at the end . The viewer of well-aged TV movies , on the other hand , is probably the least discriminating patron any art ever had . All he 's doing is killing time . To captivate both of these audiences is quite a trick . Guinness did it in the role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealing a truckload of gold from the Bank of England , the sea captain bigamously but successfully married to two wives in two ports , the poor professor who finances his taste for classical music by hijacking money shipments from the Royal Mail . Guinness gave these parts a wistful sincerity that made them hilariously believable . He touched the larceny in all our hearts . So it may come as a slight shock to Americans to learn that Guinness , in England , is best known as a serious actor of Shakespearean antecedents . There , his fans are almost a cult , with a membership that cuts across class lines . " The most versatile actor of our times , and I 've seen them all for forty years , " said the manager of a London branch bank . " I doubt he 's the Shakespearean tragedian that Giclgud is. or Olivier . He seems to lack the effrontery that creates the distinguished style . He ca n't say ' Prittice , sirrah ! ' as convincingly as they  --  do you follow me ? Otherwise , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the porter walked out with inc . " Do n't you believe it about Mr. Guinness , guv'nor ! " he said earnestly . " ' E can s'y , ' Prithee , sirrah ! ' as good as any , and I 've ' card ' inn do it . " The London drama critics , who will go on riding by divine right long after the last throne has toppled . arc divided on Guinness the tragedian . Some think him great ; others feel lie is still groping . A few have even leaned down from Olympus to chide him for his apparently artless style in serious modern roles . And the truth is , he uses few of the florid effects usually found filed under Acting , Classic . But in light comedy , as the affable rogues he played in his most successful pictures , all England thinks him unique . They 're very proud of him over there . Guinness has appeared briefly in two Broadway plays and in two films made largely for American audiences , and with American financing or in American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producers have lost their shirts on several big-name English stars who failed to fascinate the corn belt . Hollywood pricked up its cars at the word that came from studio branch offices in London that a new star had risen there . But on its first tentative offers , either the part or the price , or both , were unattractive . Not until Guinness proved his pulling power on the art , circuit and TV could M-G-M sign him for The Swan , with Grace Kelly . The Swan was the sensitive story of the courtship of a princess and a prince . It was only so-so as a moneymaker . One theory is that Miss Kelly 's marriage to Prince Rainier , which , by amazing coincidence , came off just as the movie came out . had the better script . In the Prisoner , playing a Catholic cardinal tortured into a false confession by the Communists , Guinness not only showed Americans he could muster a strong dramatic role but made some money for Columbia Pictures , which released the film in the United States . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try his luck with the American audience in the traditional Hollywood spectacular . The picture was shot in the jungles of Ceylon , in Technicolor and CinemaScope , at a cost that started out to be $2,200,000 and ended up closer to 53,000,000 . Its producer was Sam Spiegel. its director David Lean . Besides Guinness , it has in its international cast America 's William Holden , England 's Jack Hawkins , and Japan 's Sessue Hayakawa . This is the first team , and someone on it will have fans wherever movies arc exhibited . The odd thing is that so much of the responsibility for recapturing this investment , plus a profit , rests on the frail-looking shoulders of an extremely shy Englishman who could walk down any street in America without being recognized . It happens daily in England . In no way does Alec Guinness resemble the conventional movie star . Guinness is of average height , a slightly bald man of bland coloration , with a few freckles and a small mezzanine at the belt line . He dresses conservatively , and his carriage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disputed milk bill . " He looks unmemorable , " said Kenneth Tynan , dramatic critic for the London Sunday Observer in a puzzled little book he wrote about Guinness , How can a man so unstriking stimulate the evangelical affection Guinness receives on both sides of the Atlantic ? " Versatility , " the word most often used in connection with him . does not explain it . There are other actors of range and scope who remain relatively obscure . It might be worth while to rummage for clues in his biography , Alec Guinness was born in April , 1914 , in London . He was an only child , and his parents separated when he was eighteen months old . He was eight years old when he last saw his father , and has only a cloudy memory of him . What annoys him most is to be mistaken for a scion of the ancient family that makes Guinness stout . It happens frequently . Indeed , there seems to be a fairly general belief that brewery money paid his way backstage , and that his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with time on his hands . " Nothing could be farther from the truth ! " he told me rather sharply . " I have no connection with the family and no inherited wealth . My father was able to put aside a small educational fund for me , but I 've had to support myself ever since leaving school . " He spent most of his childhood in what we would call boarding schools . He did not make friends easily and was not good at team sports . He blamed himself for this , and at an early age developed an intense dislike of his own personality and face . It survives in vestige today . This state of mind could be unhealthy in a growing boy . Alec might have turned out to be one of those disagreeably sensitive brats who trail after divorced mothers from one residential hotel to another , wallowing in self-pity . What saved him seems to have been a streak of plain British bullheadedness ; this trait also survives today . Failing at football , young Alec went out for track , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprinter , and he enjoyed it . Looking back now , he thinks he probably had more friends than he realized at the time . No doubt he was a misfit , but probably not as a result of what child psychologists today call " personality defects . " Strongly individualistic even then , his adult intelligence and artistic tastes would have made him the odd boy in any group . Guinness thinks he was about twelve when he first thought of being an actor . It began as boyish play-acting and dressing in costume . " One tried to escape from oneself in any way possible , " he told me . This frequent use of the impersonal pronoun in speaking of himself is at first disconcerting to an interviewer . He says he is no longer shy , but it 's a struggle to make him say " I. " By the time he left school , at seventeen , the stage had become an obsession . He went to the theater often and sat brooding in the cheapest seats . He knew not a soul in show business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career . The money from his educational trust was almost gone . An adult friend got him a job with an advertising agency , where his writing talent might be useful . He started as a junior copywriter  --  actuallv , an apprentice  --  at a pound a week , a little under five dollars at that time . Thanks to depression prices , that sum , added to the dribble that remained from his school fund , kept him alive , It even allowed sixpence a week for the theater . " I saw every show in London , " 79 he recalls . " I saw everything Gielgud ever did . It was during that period that I saw the greatest single performance of my life  --  Ernest Milton as Hamlet . " The San Francisco-born Milton was then at the peak of his powers . His Hamlet so moved Alec that the boy stumbled home . went to bed and remained there twenty-four hours , unwilling to let the exaltation slip away . Eventually it did , leaving him to face the realities of his own existence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He probably had everything an advertising man needs , except a desire to be one . His pay was raised totwenty-five and then to thirty shillings a week  --  not bad , but not good either . On the strength of this new wealth , he enrolled for one lesson a week in a London dramatic school . He was then nineteen , a gaunt , underfed youth , pale and wispy , and more self-distrustful than ever . It took great nerve to walk in and gulp , " I want to be an actor . " His reception was heart-warming . He was treated kindly , even deferentially . He rubbed shoulders with professionals , and heard for the first time the intoxicating backstage vernacular . His teacher praised his work generously , For six weeks he lived in a rosy dream . He woke up with brutal suddenness , when the director called him in and advised him to give it up . " You 'll never make an actor . " he was told , when they pulled the rug out from under him . Not until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one of the well-heeled brewing heirs . The decision that he had no talent followed instantaneously upon the discovery that he had no money . Ii there was a single critical turning point in Alec Guinness-career , this was it . He suffered from malnutrition of both body and spirit , and from the normal adolescent myopia that secs trouble double . This , temeinteer , was the sensitive youth who had gone to bed for twenty-four hours abler seeing a outlying performarese of Hamlet . To the slinge and arrows of his ov , ii out . rageous fortune . he reacted be applying to the Roy al Acadents of Dramatic Art for a scholarship , Told there were 114.111e left , he went to the Fay Compton school , then one of the best in London . There , in a single audition , he won a scholarship that paid his full tuition for a year . But nothing for living expelleee !

At the annual school show , a year later , he won first prize . One of the judges was his idol , John Gielgud . then , as now , considered te most critics to be the greatest loins Shakespearean actor  --  he was knighted in 1953 by Queen Elizabeth for his accomplishments . Out of school , but also out of money , Guinness applied for work at every theater . He got a small part in a play called Libel ! . He sat at a courtroom table in a junior counsel 's wig and said not a word . But he was onstage . He was acting !

Since then , success seems to have made it easier for him to endure his own face and personality . When Queer Cargo closed , he got up nerse enough to send his name in to Gielguid , in his dressing room at Wyndham 's 1 heater . To his alliatt merit . the great iiiiUr not only saw hint but remembered him . " You 're the lad who won the prize , ' he said , with a warm smile . " Now , what can we do for you ? " " I 've got to have work , " Guinness said , " I 'll have a job for you soon , " Gielgud replied , " butt you 're far too thin ! You hasc n't beer ; eating , these you ? " Guinness admitted it . Gielgud continued talking , winningly and without condescension. 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As he talked , Gielgud laid twenty pounds on the table . " Take that and cat . " he commanded . Guinness thanked hint and stumbled out  --  without the money . He was so grateful for Gielgud 's interest , so heartened by his encouragement and so sure of a job under his sponsorship , that he would these stared rather than touch the money . Gielguil referred him to several jobs . He got none of them . He 's not sure how he lined until Gielgud opened in Hamlet at the New Theater that fall of 1934 . Sure enough , he remembered . He gave Guinness the small part of Osrie . To support one of the greatest of all actors in one of the greatest of all roles was , for a lad of twenty , a heady business , This Hamlet ran for 155 performances , and , nest to Gielgud himself , the actor most singled out for mention by the critics was Guinness . Few supporting players base ever had such notices in the history of the London stage . Guinness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1936 he went to the Old Vic , where Gielgud 's leading rival for domination of the London theater , Tyrone Guthrie , was directing . A year later he was back with Gielgud at the Queen 's Theater , but in 1938 he returned to the Old Vie and toured the Continent with it . He worked so hard  --  and so successfully  --  at supporting roles that he was hardly aware that his long apprenticeship was over . Returning to England , he played leads and tried directing and producing . Then came the war . Guinness enlisted in the Royal Navy in 1941 and served as an ordinary seaman on a coastal tanker . " It was scry dull , " he recalls , " I suppose I had a lot of miseries , but looking back , I do n't remember them . It now seems to me to have been a quiet , pleasant time , with some very fine friendships . " The quietness ended when he was picked for officer 's training , Sent to Boston to command his first ship . a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A play called Flare Path was then going the rounds of Broadway . looking for a producer . It was pretty candidly pro-British , and when Guinness was offered the lead , the Admiralty gave him a temporary leave and its heartiest blessing . Flare Path closed in three weeks , and Lieutenant Guinness was back at sea in time to share in the Sicily invasion . He earned a modest place in history when , through a mix-up in orders , he arrived thirty minutes ahead of the main assault force . The first Allied righting man ashore in Sicily was Guinness . " We came in so hard that it took three weeks to retinal us , " he recalls . " There were a few Italians lurking about in pillboxes. brandishing rifles . But they looked the other way and we landed quite unopposed . " He finished the war in the Adriatic , supplying Yugoslav partisans . They were a quick-triggered bunch , and several times he had to bring his ship in under the hot lire of his own allies . Demobilized , he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ii did well in England and on the American art circuit . He made live more films , winning a popularity that rather stunned him , He appeared briefly um Broadway in The Cocktail Party , before making The Lavender Hill Mob in 1951 . After it came out , the public demanded more . Other comedies followed , but he still kept veering toward the dramatic stage , like a compass needle seeking the north . In 1952 he went to the Shakespeare Festival at Stratford  --  on-Avon . Ontario , for his first Canadian appearance and first time in the role of Richard III . By then , Hollywood was beginning to beckon , with its hands full of United Sta to dollars . Unlike many British actors , Guinness liked Hollywood . This may have been because Hollywood liked him . Often naive in its preoccupation with color , wide screens , publicity and sex , Hollywood honestly worships talent . There you 'll find the warmest Guinness fans of all .

So was Charles Chaplin . So is Maurice Chevalier . So is Cantinflas , the great Mexican comedian . Eseryone will have his own ' magic ' list , but you 'll have to put Alec Guinness on too . " This is one explanation for the Guinness vogue .
