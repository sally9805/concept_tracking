The Mask A Story by Storm Jameson Drawings by Adolph Hallman T HE sun had less warmth than it should have had in mid-February in Nice : it was dulled by a thin cloud which spread across the sky like a cold breath , darkening the sea , tarnishing the black evergreens and livid rocks of the hills . Hurrying across the wide square on his way home to lunch , Biancherie thought : How disappointed he will he if tomorrow it rains . The whole face of the square was masked by the enormous figures , flat , highly-colored , of a child 's picture hook , fixed there in readiness for the first procession of the Carnival . This year , for the first time , his son Michel had been expecting it . Last year and the year before he had accepted it when it came along , as a day no odder than other days . But between four years and five is an immense gap : suddenly , from being a baby , Michel had become a little boy who knew what Carnival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong shabby house near the port : to reach it he had to climb eight flights of dark stone stairs . Once there , he had all the light and sun there was  --  and , from the narrow balcony outside the sitting room , a view over roofs to the harbor and the sea . As he opened the door , Michel rushed out of the kitchen and hurled himself at his father 's legs . He was wearing long tight black and white checked trousers , a short velvet jacket , buckled slippers ; and a small hat with a long scarlet quill . Biancherie picked him up , rubbed his cheek against the child 's hot soft round face , and asked , " What 's this ? " " For tomorrow , " the child cried . " And we 've bought my mask . " " Show me , " said Biancherie . He set the child down and watched him run along the narrow passage to his bedroom . then went into the kitchen . It was warm with the smells of cooking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowls and glasses on the table , looked at him with a smile . " He would try the things on , " she said . Standing near her , he laid a finger on her hair , black and gleaming , very carefully arranged , and smelling of the scented oil she used ; her body had its own scent , a good vegetable smell , strong and pleasant . At thirty-one Lucile Biancherie was almost as slender as when he married her ; she was twenty-five then , three years older than lie was : his mother , who opposed the marriage , had said : " In five years she 'll be as round and broad as a casserole . " It was a false prophecy . Except that her arms had become fuller , she had not changed ; her skin was still so smooth and supple that it was more like a finely spun tissue than human skin ; her eyes , dark , immense , under black arched eyebrows , were clear and calm , their thick lids uncreased . She had given Michel everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's eyes , smaller , paler , with all Biancherie 's look of patience and goodness : for the rest he was his mother , with her smoothly rounded knees and wide shoulders , fine straight nose , and in his armpits and all the curves and hollows of his small body the same strong clean scent , of ripe figs , musk , olives , new bread . He had , too , his mother 's passionate temper , changing in an instant from grief to happiness , from blissful tenderness to a moment of violent rage , only a moment ; like his mother again , he had a warmly loving heart . N OT once in six years had Biancherie regretted marrying a young woman without a penny to her name or a decent dress to her back . He seated himself at the table . " What is Michel supposed to be ? " he asked . " Why , a little English boy , of course , " cried his wife . " Did n't you look at him ? " " Yes , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I have n't seen it yet . He went out this morning , with old Madame Titine , and they bought it . A lion or a clown , or some sort of grotesque . " Michel ran into the room , wearing the mask . It was neither grotesque nor animal ; it was simply the face of a silly vapid young man , tiny black mustache , weak chin , turned-up nose . Biancherie disliked it at once , but until his wife burst out laughing he did not realize why . " But it 's you , Jeannot , " she stammered , " it 's exactly you . . . Did you know it was like Daddy ? " she asked the little boy . " That 's why I chose it , " said Michel , pleased . Pulling the mask off , he kissed it tenderly , then climbed on to his father 's knee , and kissed him with the same warm love . Biancherie barely responded . He was shocked , a little dazed , hurt . Did they really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatuous booby ? Abruptly , his wife realized that he was hurt . She came round the table to him and pressed his head against her body , roughening his hair . " Do n't spoil Michel 's pleasure in his mask , " she said softly ; " he chose it because he loves you and thinks you 're the best-looking man in the world . As I do . " " But if that 's what I 'm like . . . " he began . " You 're not . It 's a child 's drawing of you , it 's not you at all . Not really . " She caressed his face , then bent and kissed him . Reassured , he ate his lunch with appetite , but when , before going out , lie went into their bedroom , he stood for a full minute in front of the looking glass , scrutinizing his face ... Do I look like it ? . . . True , his chin was nothing much of a chin , and the black circumflex of mustache drawn halfway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on the mask , but there , surely , the likeness ceased ? For less than a second his head swam , and his eyes looked back at him from the glass through slits , like Michel 's eyes through the slits in the mask . He pulled himself together and saw the face he was familiar with , not handsome , certainly , but not vacant and conceited , an amiable gentle candid face , his face . As he turned from the glass , Lucile came into the room : picking up scarf and overcoat , he kissed her and went off . T HE sky was less veiled , as if the sun were getting the better of the cloud , and as he hurried through the narrow streets he felt happy and exhilarated . When he reached the pharmacy , his assistant , old Angeli , had unlocked the door and was waiting for him inside , his face dark with news . " You 're wanted at your mother 's . She 's dying . They 've just telephoned from the Red Cross post . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The news was expected , yet it startled him , as if something in his body were being squeezed and twisted . He decided , although he had more than twenty-five miles to go , to take a taxi . He hurried back home , told Lucile , who cried warmly , " Oh , poor old thing ? " , promised to get a message to her in the morning , and went off . A feeling of suspense which was neither anxiety nor grief but confused both , kept him leaning forward tensely in the cab , his mind strained toward the village he would reach , with luck , in two hours . It . was a terrific climb , and at the garage near the harbor they had given him an old wheezing car ; he felt vexed that he had not taken one of the splendid cars waiting to be hired by tourists . But long before they left the outskirts of Nice and began to climb into the hills , he had ceased to strain forward , and was in , yes , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had only to come uninvited into his head , for Nice  --  even old Nice where he lived , its houses vibrating like wasps ' nests , its odorous noisy streets  --  to become shadowy and colorless : at once , without willing it , he was crossing the small dusty square in scorching sun , his feet burned through the soles of his sandals by the iron-hard earth , his eyelids fluttering in the light ; or walking , stumbling over loose stones , down the street to his mother 's house : not a single street in this village of two hundred souls had been made ; they were all tracks , of pale dust in summer , of mud in winter before the snow came and after it melted . Even sometimes on first waking , before he stretched out a hand and touched Lucile lying warm and insensible beside him , he was in that other room , between bare walls he could touch on both sides without moving from his slip of a bed , staring at the barred window high in the wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his and the one where his mother slept , and cooked , behind a screen . Here they sat in the evenings , he bent over his lessons under the petrol lamp , she upright , hands folded , eyes fixed , not in a glance , however distant , but in a total absence , as if she had separated herself , once and for all , from every object and creature round her . Next door to this almost hovel was the house , the large dignified house where he had been born and had lived until an evening in his fifth year . That evening he came home from spending the day lower down the steep street with Madame Gabano , his foster mother , to find the great front door locked and sealed . His mother was waiting for him in the doorway of their new home . As a child does , he had accepted the change without misgiving . His father was not there . Once after this he asked for him , and she said violently , " He has gone . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . His father had been away for days , one of his habitual absences . That morning , after his mother had dispatched him to Madame Gabano , she sent to Vence for the notary and ordered him to fix seals on the house  --  her own  --  and to inform her husband that this time it would be no use his returning . It was finished . Let him stay with his other wife . . . Her husband made no attempt to come back to her ; his son did not even know whether he were alive still . The great house remained shut up , all its furniture in place . She never set foot in it again . T HE boy was not unhappy living , with his nearly silent mother , in their two rooms . He was by nature gay and confi-dent , and he had always ( like his father ) another home , his foster mother 's , Madame Gabano 's warm dark kitchen below the little cafe with its overpowering smell of red coarse wine and garlic : the window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descending pattern of hills folding one into another , down , down , to the plain and the thin distant arc of sea . Here he had a family , a real family , with outbursts of laughter , scolding , tears ; in one corner Pierre Gabano 's bed , Pierre his foster brother  --  his friend , Pierre . Four years older than Jeannot , Pierre , at nine , was not a child : broad-shouldered , with a high color in his dark cheeks , large strong hands , feet of which every toe moved as easily as a finger , and magnificent eyes , so thickly fringed by long black eyelashes that they appeared to take up even more space than they did in his wide face . He was short in body , but very strong , very gentle . Jean Biancherie followed at his heels like a young dog , waiting for the caress he was certain before long to get . Pierre at this time was his mother , it was with Pierre that he had all his experience of the tenderness of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother sealed the house , Pierre was the whole of his family . Then , with the reckless generosity for which she was known , Madame Gabano adopted the daughter of neighbors who had died suddenly . Lucile Grassi was twelve . He remembered her coming into the kitchen when he was there , in her black ugly dress , her eyes reddened , her lips thick with crying . Pierre was not at home . Madame Gabano had to go upstairs to the cafe , and he was left alone with her . She sat down on the corner of Pierre 's bed and took no notice of his shy words . After a time , because he did not know what else to do , he began to reel about the room like a clown , hoping to make her laugh . She did laugh . She laughed , then cried a little , and a minute later fell suddenly asleep , falling hack on the bed as if something in her had given way . He was afraid to budge . He stood and stared . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He saw the fingers of this hand , small , plump , slowly uncurl until it lay on the floor like the soft paw of a little animal . Holding his breath , he went down on one knee and kissed it , timidly , gently . I must , he reflected , have begun to love her in that moment , without knowing it . She returned his love . For Tier years she was childish , and they played together as if they were of an age , rolling about the floor , like puppies , under Pierre 's amused eyes . He was only a year older than Lucile , but at this time , at thirteen , he was already almost a young man . Sometimes , between the warmth of the kitchen and their exertions , the two young ones rolled into each other and fell asleep . Pierre picked them up then and dropped them on his bed . T HE car was grinding up the last mile of road . Seen from below , the village was a jagged line of walls the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill . Below them the hill dropped sheerly away a hundred feet into a gentler slope scarred by derelict terraces , from the time when eight hundred people lived here and grew olives . Now the only olive trees were his mother 's . The car stopped in the square ; the driver refused to attempt the street leading out of it . Empty in winter sunlight , the square received him and pushed him gently down the stony dust of the street , between houses , half of them abandoned , the rest all eyes behind the low windows . Is she still alive ? He pushed open the door . Madame Gabano stood up at the side of the bed , balancing from side to side her sparrow 's head , thrusting her wrinkled lips forward in a smile . " You 're here , jeannot . Good . " He bent over his mother lying in the center of the bed . " Is she asleep ? " " No , poor lady  --  unconscious . " She sighed " Now you 've come I can go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back . " " What is there to do for her ? " he asked , uneasy . " Nothing , my poor jeannot . There 's nothing . " Alone , he brought his face close to the face lying there inert , a fragment of old brown wood , the eyelids a darker brown than the rest , and sunken , as if there were nothing had been an absence an absence at last of in her kitchen . He went off , ate , drank part of the bottle of wine , and returned . " How long will this go on ? " he asked . " A day . Two days . Or a few hours . Go to bed and sleep . I 'll sit up . " " No , Mamma , " he told her . " Leave her to me . " She fussed round him for a time , and at last , quite glad to go , went . 1 T wAs act interminable night . He thought of Lucile asleep now in the wide bed in their room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledge her as a daughter-in-law , of her contempt for the young woman as a nothing , the daughter of two nothings . Double zero , she called her . What else but this contempt had driven Lucile to refuse , during more than two long years , to marry him ? The first time he asked her , when he was nineteen and she twenty-two , she had refused gently ; after that , her rejections became sharper and irritable . She suffered , he thought , from that cruel double zero . When she gave in , it came suddenly , brusquely , very much as she had dropped asleep that first day , a spring broken in her . He was already in Nice , living there during the week and coming home at the weekend . One Sunday he had been helping to pick the olives ; toward four o'clock , exhausted , he gave it up and came home . He left Pierre there , still hard at work . Almost at the village , he saw a young woman still bending over the stone trough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been washing . It was Lucile . He walked with her to Madame Gabano 's , carrying the damp bundle She forced herself to be gay , to chatter to him , but she was tired . In the kitchen she held out her hands , purple with cold , finger-ends wrinkled . Half smiling , half bitter , she said , " They 'll soon be like everyone else 's  --  pads , not hands . " He caught hold of them . " When you marry me , you 'll be Nice , with no need to ruin your wash sheets . " She laughed at him , mocking and gentle . " What could I do in Nice ? They would make fun of me . " No one would laugh at you , at my wife . Everyone without exception would look at you with respect . You 're so calm , so beautiful , you would be like a princess living there . " She turned away from him . " I 'm too old for you . I 'm three years older than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently , he made an unsteady move toward her . She was going to give in to him . He knew . " Nonsense , " he said , with difficulty . " You are only a child  --  my child . I was born older than you , much older . " She let him take her in his arms . There were tears on her eyelids , but she was smiling . He kissed the side of her neck : though she did not return his kisses , she tightened her hold of him and he felt her tremble . Neither of them heard Pierre . The first sound they heard was his indrawn breath . Lucile freed herself and wheeled round . " Jeannot and I are going to be married. - " She has agreed , " Biancherie cried . " At last . " He waited for Pierre to smile , to throw both arms round him and kiss him , and kiss Lucile . Pierre did not move . " Is it true ? " he asked Lucile . " Yes , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why ? " said Biancherie . " We 've always loved each other , I 'm of age , I have money of my own , why should n't we get married ? " " Your mother , " said Pierre . Oh , if that were all . " My mother will agree to what she ca n't prevent any longer . " " D' you think so ? That is n't my idea of Madame Biancherie . She has never in her life agreed to what vexed her . Coming from God or the devil . Still less chance when it only comes from you . " " Why are you talking like this ? " Biancherie asked . " He is surprised , " said Lucile quietly . She spoke to Pierre , looking at him . " How can I go on living here  --  with nothing  --  with hardly a pair of stockings to my name ? And nothing to look forward to except hard work , poverty , wrinkles ? Think , Pierre . " " Yes , " he answered . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to the other . He smiled . Laying an arm round Biancherie , he kissed him on both checks . " You 'll be happy . Lucile will be kind to you . " Biancherie laughed . " You have n't asked me to be kind to Lucile . " " No need , " said Pierre , " you could n't help it . You ca n't help being kind . " " Who could , " he smiled , " to Lucile ? " ? " Who could to Lucile ? " echoed Pierre . It was after then marriage that Pierre himself went off , to become a sailor . His mother , Madame Biancheric , the whole village , were stupefied . The sea , after all ! But he enjoyed his new life . The first thing he did at the end of a voyage , before going home to his mother , was to climb the eight flights of stairs to see his foster brother and Lucile , bringing them whatever had caught his eye in Valparaiso or Puerto Buenos , a piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These visits , too short , were gay , gayer than the Carnival . T HE shadows flying up and out of the night light merged into one shadow . Hanging forward in his chair , he fell asleep . He woke with a jerk of his body . His watch had stopped , but he heard passing the house a man going to work , and he knew it must be daylight . Noiselessly he opened the shutter : light came into the room . Madame Gabano arrived and sent him off to drink the coffee she had left at the side of the stove . Later , about ten , the doctor arrived . " Another twenty-four hours , " he said . " She 's strong . " " Poor lady , " said Madame Gabano . " She feels nothing , " said the doctor . " Can you be sure ? " The doctor shrugged his shoulders . He had other patients in the village , and went off . Biancherie hurried out . He telephoned to Angeli at the pharmacy , to tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know  --  at once  --  that I shall be staying up here another night . " He went back to the house . As he opened the door , his foster mother turned round from the bed slowly , and told him , " Your mother is dead . " An hour or so later , when the doctor was leaving the house for the second time , Madame Gabano said , " My poor Jeannot , you must go out for a time , and leave her with me . Put it at two hours . What will you do ? Walk ? Go home ? " By home , as he knew , she meant her own kitchen . Obeying an impulse , he asked the doctor , " If you 're going back to Nice will you run me down there ? I can see my wife for a few minutes and come straight back . " " Certainly . " He wanted the warmth of Lucile 's body against his own for a moment , a solace , a remedy against the mortal cold he had felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All would be well if , for only a moment , he could rest his cheek below her throat and feel her hand press it there closely . The complete security she gave him with this one gesture was so exquisite that each time it happened he thought the same thing : She is giving me my soul . Nothing else she did for him equaled this gift of security . So gentle , so simple , so beyond any gratitude . Always , he felt always , when he put his arms round her , or when , turning the light off , he came to lie beside her in their bed , the same sensation of warmth and safety he had felt as a child the moment he stepped into his foster mother 's kitchen and closed the door on everything that chilled and puzzled him outside . T HE doctor dropped him in the center of Nice . It was two hours before the Carnival would start , but already excited children were running about the square in any sort of cheap pinned-together disguise . He smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He let himself into the apartment without a sound . Michel , he knew , would be sleeping , or at ' least lying on his bed pretending to sleep . " No sleep , no Carnival , " his mother would have warned . There were no sounds of life but , to his surprise , he saw that three people had had lunch in the kitchen . The table was still covered with their plates and glasses . The door of the sitting room was open , and he could see across it to the balcony . Lucile was out there , with Pierre . They stood , so closely embraced , Lucile 's body as if molded into Pierre 's , his mouth closed on hers , that the only movement possible was that of Pierre 's hands , passing in a series of light touches up her body as far as the shoulders . When they reached her shoulders she pressed her head back , an expression of anguish on her face , her lips parted , showing the line of her teeth , her eyes wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had never seen anything like it on her face . But how could I ? he thought dully . She never felt like that for me . Without another thought , without making a sound , he crept back along the passage to the door , opened it noiselessly , and went away . F OR a long time he walked about the streets , with a harassed rapid step , as though in search of something . He was not thinking . When , without meaning to , he came back toward the square , it was filled with people . The monstrous grotesques of the Carnival were jigging round in the sun , under a torrent of music brayed by the loudspeakers . Suddenly , not very far from him in the crowd , he saw the three of them , Lucile , Pierre , laughing , with Michel straddling his broad shoulders . The child was wearing his mask , and now for the first time Biancherie felt hatred opening in him , like a horrible wound . No doubt Lucile had lied , it was she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh at him . For a searing moment he confounded her and the child in one spasm of hatred . Michel put his hand up , pushed the mask off his face , and instantly became his good little Michel , impulsive , warmhearted , loving . The hatred devouring Biancherie turned against his wife and Pierre ; if it had touched them they would be dead . Afraid of being seen , he turned and elbowed his way through the crowd , and went by back streets to the pharmacy . The idea of killing them persisted in him : his meager body had become a block of anger . A phrase repeated itself in his mind . " Double zero , double zero . " If he could rub out this double zero , make it the nothing it had always , except in his in-fatuated head , been , what a relief . What completely until he felt a glass placed against his lips . " Drink this up . " He drank it , and felt his senses return . " Thanks . I 'm all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Angeli . " You should go home now and let your wife put you to bed for the day . " " Perhaps . " He left , and went back to the apartment . There , the remains of lunch had been cleared away , except for a nearly full bottle of the rough wine Pierre liked . No doubt they meant to finish it at supper . He did not look inside the bedroom , his and Lucile 's . Instead , he busied himself dissolving the gardenal in the wine , then sat down to wait . As they came in at the door he would jump up , cry , " Pierre ! What luck ! When did you get here ? " And run to the cupboard for glasses . Pretending to drink he would watch , watch , until , not sure what was happening to them , half insensible , their limbs heavy , first one and then the other slid to the floor . In all this , he had forgotten Michel . When , abruptly , he thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Michel as a six-months-old baby . He had been as old as that before Pierre  --  away on a long voyage , lasting a year and a half  --  saw him . How gently he had lifted him out of his cradle ! And held him on one arm , Michel 's head fitting neatly into the hollow of his shoulder . " He 's exactly his mother , " he said . " Yes , is n't he ! " At this instant Michel opened his eyes and looked directly at the dark rosy face above his . Smiling , . Pierre traced with his finger a line round these widely-open eyes . " But he has your eyes , Jeannot , your good kind eyes . Let 's hope he has your kind heart as well . " " If he has as much goodness as Lucile , that 's all I want , " he answered . Astonishing both men , Lucile burst into a violent fit of tears . " No , no , " she stammered , " no , I 'm not good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time he had put it down to the nervous overexcitement of a young woman with her first baby . She had recovered quickly , and the evening , Michel safely asleep , had been one of delicious happiness and gaiety , with bursts of laughter when Pierre brought out the wildly unsuitable presents he had thought of for the child . When , he wondered , did it begin ? As IF it had been waiting all these years for him , a scene came back from the past . From his twelfth year He was in the kitchen with Lucile and his foster brother : it was late evening , nearly ten o'clock , and still very warm . It had been a hot heavy day . Lucile , restless and languid , moved about the room , and Pierre  --  Pierre the young man of sixteen , with the line of black feathery hairs along his upper lip  --  watched her . " Jeannot , your mother will be angry if you do n't go home , " he said . He knew it , but did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss . Suddenly Pierre stood up and walked across the room to where Lucile was leaning against the window . Stooping , he rubbed his dark face against hers , and passed his mouth over her forehead , her eyes , hair . These caresses were not different from others the boy had seen him give her , yet there was a difference . Bending lower , Pierre made the infantile gesture of pressing his nose against the breasts outlined under her cotton dress . Turning , she looked at the boy . " Go home to bed . " The roughness , the impatience , of her voice startled him out of his inertia . He went . They had begun to make love , he thought . Or that , perhaps , was the evening they began . Closing his eyes , he let rise behind them images thrown up by his jealousy and rage : Pierre taking the girl 's head between his hands , drawing it toward him , his mouth seeking her hair or her eyes , Pierre lying back , for a moment passive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , scattering these images , flinging them aside , there rose in him a jet of pure grief . It was without force or heat , yet tore him apart . She has always been so kind , he thought . And Pierre is so kind . A ridiculous memory seized him : the day when , a very little boy , he forgot himself as they say , and Pierre whipped off his knickers , washed him , washed them , dried them on the stove , and had them back on him before Madame Gabano came downstairs from the caf ? . The memory filled hint with love . His heart turned over in him . Never , he had never felt for his foster brother such a swelling wave of love and tenderness . It swept him to a point where he felt , about both of them , his wife and Pierre , that they were younger and weaker than he was . It was almost a maternal feeling , astonishing and frightening . How I spoiled things for them , he thought . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured future , I turned Lucile away from her contentment as the wife of a man who could give her none of the things I have given her , with whom she would have been poor , hard-worked , prematurely old , but  --  in a word  --  filled . He felt a sharp pity for her , pure love , pure tenderness . The sooner I take myself out of their way the better , he thought calmly . He stood up . Shaking the bottle of wine as if it were medicine , he measured out half of it into a tumbler , poured the rest down the sink , and carried the tumbler into the bedroom . He drank all the bitter wine , and lay down . T HE door was flung open by Michel . He danced into the room , wearing his silly little mask . Capering round the bed , he cried , " Look at me , I 'm you now . I 'm me and you . Do look . " Since there was no answer from the bed , he pouted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tonton Pierre that his father had come back and was asleep .
