Now any full moon is a great moon and a wonderful thing , but a strong case may be made out for this one as the best of the lot . To be out in it is good , to be comfortably warm indoors and looking through the window , also is good . It appeals to any taste  --  or at least ' to any taste which may be cultivated to the point when the February moon is given some thought .

On a clear night no other moon shines so brightly , no . other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp shadows across city streets . It invites a walk , but because of the temperature it does not invite too much of a walk . It invites a long , long glance through the window , but because of its radiance it suggests awed silence . Like a gigantic , sparkling diamond , it defeats words . It is I special , no doubt of it . Other moons have received Best more tributes . The harvest of moon , for example , is all tied All in with corn husking , pumpkins and grandma 's apple pies  --  even though grandma now gets the ingredients from cans and from packages of quick-mix .

If it is possible toWalk night , and nothing subin versive interferes , an Moonlight hour should be set aside for a walk . The ideal would be a walk through the woods , preferably of pine , not thickly grown . The trees not only will stretch up into the moonlight , but their shadows will waver and dance underfoot .
