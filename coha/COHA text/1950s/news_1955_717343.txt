txt Like many people on this side of the Iron Curtain , Russia 's Mr. Khrushchev is apparently all mixed up about the purposes of international trade . . After telling a group of United States Senators that the Soviets want much more trade with this country , he explained : " We value . trade least for economic reasons , and most for political purposes as a means of promoting better relations between our countries . " That is just the trouble . People are always trying to encourage or discourage trade for political purposes . But it is a dubious political weapon and one which is least useful when most political . Suppose the Soviets harbor some motion that by expanding their trade offices here they can subvert a lot of Americans . If that is the purpose , and the trade turns out to be more mythical than real , the effort will simply cause more resentment against the Soviets . By the same token . we may delude ourselves if we think that we can materially hurt the Soviet Union by withholding trade for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any tradein war goods . which is a pretty specialized kind of trade anyway . But there is a wide tendency to believe that refusing to sell the Soviets things like surplus farm commodities would impair their military strength . That may be doubted . More likely , it would create resentment among the Russian people against the United States . So when you try to make trade a political instrument , you can never be sure it wo n't boomerang . That is one reason why the economic considerations Mr. Khrushchev and so many others disavow are a safer guide . In this case the real question ought to be whether the Soviets can ship enough of the things we want to justify a sizable trade expansion . It is not at all certain that they have enough . But if they do , and trade increases on that basis , Mr. Khrushchev need not worry about " promoting better relations , " if he is . That will come about as a political by-product of normal economic relationship . It will not come about if the by-product is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
