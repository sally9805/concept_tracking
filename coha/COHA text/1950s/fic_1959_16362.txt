CITY AT NIGHT A hearse of Late Twenties vintage is proceeding at a dignified pace along a half-deserted wintry street . Inside the hearse , there are four somber men in black  --  and a coffin , of course , with a wreath of chrysanthemums on top . One of the men is driving , another is in the seat beside him . The other two are sitting in the rear of the hearse , flanking the coffin . All four seem fully aware of the solemnity of the occasion . Now they hear a siren , faint at first , but rapidly growing louder . The driver and the man next to him exchange a nervous glance . The other two men move tensely toward the rear door of the hearse , raise the black curtain over the glass panel , and peek out cautiously . Through the glass panel , they see a police car bearing down on them , the red light blinking , the siren screaming . The two men at the rear window gesture to the driver to step on it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly picks up speed , weaves crazily through traffic , the police car in hot pursuit . The hearse careens around a corner at eighty miles an hour , the police car right on its tail . By this time the policemen are leaning out of their car with drawn guns , firing at the hearse . The two men in the rear of the hearse , flattened against the sides , pull a couple of sawed-off shotguns out of a hidden overhead rack . Police bullets smash the glass panel and whistle through the hearse . The driver and the man next to him duck , but the hearse continues at the same breakneck speed . The two men in back shove their guns through the shattered glass , fire at the police car .  --  3  --  Despite the hail of lead , the police car  --  its windshield cobwebbed with bullet holes  --  gains on the hearse . Suddenly the car skids out of control , jumps the curb , comes to a screeching stop . Policemen leap out , fire after the hearse . In the speeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffin . Instantly three geysers of liquid spurt through the bullet holes . As the firing recedes , the two men in the back put away their guns , remove the wreath from the coffin , take the lid off . The inside is jampacked with bottles of booze , some of them shattered by the bullets . The men start to lift out the broken bottles . It is 1929 , and we are in Chicago . Traffic is light . All the shops are dark except one  --  a dimly lit establishment , from which drift the mournful strains of an organ . A circumspect sign reads : Mozarella 's Funeral Parlor 24 Hour Service In the window , a sample coffin is on display . There seem to be some rites going on inside , because a number of mourners , singly and in couples , are hurrying from the cold , windy street into Mozarella 's parlor . Meanwhile , the hearse with the damp coffin draws up to the delivery entrance at the side of the building . The driver honks the horn  --  one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and start to slide the coffin out . The side-door opens , and a dapper gent emerges . He wears a tight-fitting black suit , a black fedora , and gray spats . The spats are very important . He always wears spats . His name is Spats Colombo . He cases the street , motions the men inside . As they carry the coffin past him , he removes his fedora , holds it reverently over his heart . Then he follows the men in , his head bowed . Across the street and around the corner , three police cars draw up silently , and about fifteen uniformed policemen and plain-clothes men spill out . A captain gives whispered orders , and the men scatter and discreetly take up positions around the funeral parlor.  --  4  --  Out of one of the cars steps Mulligan , a tough Federal Agent  --  in plain clothes , of course . With him is a little weasel of a man , shivering with cold and fear . They call him Toothpick Charlie for two reasons  --  because his name is Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toothpick in his mouth . &nbsp; MULLIGAN ( indicating funeral parlor ) All right , Charlie  --  this the joint ? &nbsp; TOOTHPICK CHARLIEYes , sir . &nbsp; MULLIGANAnd who runs it ? &nbsp; TOOTHPICK CHARLIEI already told you . &nbsp; MULLIGANRefresh my memory . &nbsp; TOOTHPICK CHARLIE ( uneasily ) Spats Colombo . &nbsp; MULLIGANThat 's very refreshing . Now what 's the password ? &nbsp; TOOTHPICK CHARLIEI come to Grandma 's funeral . ( He hands him a folded piece of black crepe ) Here 's your admission card . &nbsp; MULLIGANThanks , Charlie . &nbsp; TOOTHPICK CHARLIEIf you want a ringside table , tell ' em you 're one of the pall bearers . &nbsp; MULLIGANOkay , Charlie . The police captain joins Mulligan . &nbsp; CAPTAINWe 're all set . When is the kickoff ?  --  5  --  As Mulligan consults his watch , Charlie , the toothpick working nervously in his mouth , tugs Mulligan 's sleeve . &nbsp; TOOTHPICK CHARLIELook , Chief  --  I better blow now , because if Spats Colombo sees me , it 's Good-bye Charlie . &nbsp; MULLIGANGood-bye , Charlie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MULLIGAN ( to police captain ) Give me five minutes  --  then hit ' em with everything you got . &nbsp; CAPTAINYou bet ! They synchronize their watches . Then Mulligan crosses to Mozarella 's parlor , unfolding the black crepe Charlie gave him . It is a mourning band , and he slips it over the left sleeve of his overcoat . Section Details INSIDE MOZARELLA 'S FUNERAL PARLOR It looks legitimate enough  --  with potted palms , urns and funeral statuary . A harmless gray-haired man is playing the organ with appropriate feeling . Daintily arranging a funeral spray is the proprietor himself , Mr. Mozarella . His heavy-weight build , bashed-in nose and cauliflower ears do n't quite jibe with his morning coat , striped pants , ascot and carnation . Dusting one of the marble angels is another funeral director , in the same somber uniform . Mulligan enters . &nbsp; MOZARELLA ( with grave sympathy ) Good evening , sir . &nbsp; MULLIGANI come to the old lady 's funeral . &nbsp; MOZARELLA ( looking him over ) I do n't believe I 've seen you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I 've been on the wagon .  --  6  --  &nbsp; MOZARELLAPlease ! &nbsp; MULLIGAN ( looking around ) Where are they holding the wake ? I 'm supposed to be one of the pallbearers . &nbsp; MOZARELLA ( to funeral director ) Show the gentleman to the chapel  --  pew number three . &nbsp; FUNERAL DIRECTORThis way , sir . He leads Mulligan past the organ toward the black-paneled wall , where there is no evidence of a door . The organist , without missing a note in his playing , reaches over to the end of the keyboard and pulls out a stop . One of the panels slides open , and there is a blast of music from the chapel . It 's jazz  --  and it 's " Sweet Georgia Brown . " Mulligan rears back momentarily , then follows the funeral director in . The organist pushes the stop in again , and the panel slides shut . INSIDE THE SPEAKEASY Grandma must have been quite a person , because she left a lot of condoling friends behind , and they are holding a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band is blaring . The musicians are not the slick , well-fed instrumentalists you would find in Guy Lombardo 's band  --  they have all been through the wringer , and so have their threadbare tuxedos . On the stamp-sized dance floor , six girls in abbreviated costumes are doing a frenetic Charleston . Crowded around the small tables , mourners in black arm-bands are drowning their sorrows in whatever they drink out of their coffee cups . &nbsp; MULLIGAN ( looking around ) Well , if you got ta go  --  this is the way to do it . The funeral director leads Mulligan to a table next to the bandstand . As he moves off , a waiter comes up . &nbsp; WAITERWhat 'll it be , sir ? &nbsp; MULLIGANBooze.  --  7  --  &nbsp; WAITERSorry , sir , we only serve coffee . &nbsp; MULLIGANCoffee ? &nbsp; WAITERScotch coffee , Canadian coffee , sour-mash coffee . . . &nbsp; MULLIGANMake it Scotch . A demitasse . With a little soda on the side . As the waiter starts away , Mulligan stops him . &nbsp; MULLIGANHave n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( points to a better table ) How about that one ? &nbsp; WAITERSorry , sir . That 's reserved for members of the immediate family . He winks , goes off . Mulligan scans the room . From a side door comes Spats Colombo , followed by the four hearsemen . They walk cockily toward the table " reserved for the immediate family . " A drunk , standing with a cup of booze in his hand , is in their way . Colombo pushes him aside , and the contents of the cup slop over . Colombo freezes in his tracks , glances at his feet . The other four men have also stopped , and stare in the same direction , horrified . Spats Colombo 's immaculate spats are no longer immaculate . There is a whiskey stain on one of them . Colombo throws his henchmen a sharp look . They grab the offending drunk , hustle him toward the exit . &nbsp; DRUNK ( waving empty cup ) Hey  --  I want another cup of coffee . I want another cup of coffee . Colombo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs , takes a handkerchief out of his breast pocket , and meticulously mops the moist spat . His four companions , their mission accomplished , join him at the table . Mulligan , who has been studying Colombo , consults his wristwatch .  --  8  --  The waiter comes up with his order  --  a demitasse half full of Scotch , and a split of club soda . &nbsp; MULLIGANBetter bring the check now  --  in case the joint gets raided . &nbsp; WAITERWho 's going to raid a funeral ? &nbsp; MULLIGANSome people got no respect for the dead . The waiter moves off . Mulligan sips from the cup , winces , takes a cigar out of his pocket and starts to light it . His eyes wander to the chorus girls . The girls have gone into a tap-dance . The captain of the chorus looks toward the bandstand , grins and winks at Joe , the saxophone player . He winks back . Jerry , who is thumping the bassfiddle behind him , leans forward and taps Joe on the shoulder . &nbsp; JERRYSay , Joe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; JOE ( eye on tap-dancer ) I 'll say . &nbsp; JERRYI mean , we get paid tonight , do n't we ? &nbsp; JOEYeah . Why ? He takes the mouthpiece out of his saxophone , wets the reed . &nbsp; JERRYBecause I lost a filling in my back tooth . I got ta go to the dentist tomorrow . &nbsp; JOEDentist ? We been out of work for four months  --  and you want to blow your first week 's pay on your teeth ? &nbsp; JERRYIt 's just a little inlay  --  it does n't even have to be gold  --  &nbsp; JOEHow can you be so selfish ? We owe back rent  --  we 're in for eighty-nine bucks to Moe 's Delicatessen  --  we 're being sued by three Chinese lawyers because our check bounced at the  --  9  --  laundry  --  we 've borrowed money from every girl in the line  --  &nbsp; JERRYYou 're right , Joe . &nbsp; JOEOf course I am . &nbsp; JERRYFirst thing tomorrow we 're going to pay everybody a little something on account . &nbsp; JOENo we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing tomorrow we 're going out to the dog track and put the whole bundle on Greased Lightning . &nbsp; JERRYYou 're going to bet my money on a dog ? &nbsp; JOEHe 's a shoo-in . I got the word from Max the waiter  --  his brother-in-law is the electrician who wires the rabbit  --  &nbsp; JERRYWhat are you giving me with the rabbit ? &nbsp; JOE ( pulling form sheet out of pocket ) Look at those odds  --  ten to one . If he wins , we can pay everybody . &nbsp; JERRYBut suppose he loses ? &nbsp; JOEWhat are you worried about ? This job is going to last a long time . &nbsp; JERRYBut suppose it does n't ? &nbsp; JOEJerry-boy  --  why do you have to paint everything so black ? Suppose you get hit by a truck ? Suppose the stock market crashes ?  --  10  --  Jerry , slapping the bass , is no longer listening . His eyes have strayed to Mulligan , sitting at his table , puffing on the cigar . It is n't drawing too well . Mulligan reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his vest . Using the pin of the shining badge , he pokes a hole in the wet end of the cigar . Jerry has stopped playing , and is watching Mulligan 's operation with morbid fascination . Joe , completely unaware , continues talking . &nbsp; JOESuppose Mary Pickford divorces Douglas Fairbanks ? &nbsp; JERRY ( nudging him ) Hey , Joe ! &nbsp; JOE ( paying no attention ) Suppose Lake Michigan overflows ? &nbsp; JERRYDo n't look now  --  but the whole town is under water ! He nods toward Mulligan . Joe looks off . Then , without a word , they both start packing their instruments . Mulligan pins the badge back on , checks his wrist-watch . &nbsp; MULLIGAN ( to himself ) . . . four , three , two , one . . . He glances toward the door from the funeral parlor . Right on the dot , a pair of police axes smash through the door . Instant pandemonium breaks loose in the speakeasy . Music stops , women scream , customers , chorus girls and waiters scramble toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault of the police axes . The crowd falls back , milling around frantically . Mulligan stands up , cups his hands to his mouth , and roars at the top of his voice . &nbsp; MULLIGANAll right , everybody  --  this is a raid . I 'm a federal agent , and you 're all under arrest .  --  11  --  Policemen come streaming through the splintered doors . Carried in on the tide is the drunk who was just tossed out , reeling unsteadily , and waving his empty coffee cup aloft . &nbsp; DRUNKI want another cup of coffee . The policemen start rounding up the customers and employees , and herding them toward the exits . On the bandstand , Joe and Jerry have packed their instruments , and start to fight their way through the melee , toward some stairs leading up . Mulligan , a couple of policemen in tow , comes up to Spats and his henchmen , sitting calmly at their table , with five glasses of white liquid in front of them . &nbsp; MULLIGANOkay , Spats , the services are over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MULLIGANA little country club we run for retired bootleggers . I 'm gon na put your name up for membership . &nbsp; SPATSI never join nothin ' . &nbsp; MULLIGANYou 'll like it there . I 'll have the prison tailor fit you with a pair of special spats  --  striped ! &nbsp; SPATS ( to his companions , dead-pan ) Big joke . ( to Mulligan ) What 's the rap this time ? &nbsp; MULLIGANEmbalming people with coffee  --  eighty-six proof . &nbsp; SPATSMe ? I 'm just a customer here . &nbsp; MULLIGANCome on , Spats . We know you own this joint . Mozarella is just fronting for you .  --  12  --  &nbsp; SPATSMozarella ? Never heard of him . &nbsp; MULLIGANWe got different information . &nbsp; SPATSFrom who ? Toothpick Charlie , maybe ? &nbsp; MULLIGANToothpick Charlie ? Never heard of him . He picks up Spats ' glass , sniffs it suspiciously . &nbsp; SECOND HENCHMANButtermilk ! &nbsp; MULLIGANAll right  --  on your feet . &nbsp; SPATS ( getting up slowly ) You 're wasting the taxpayers ' money . &nbsp; MULLIGANIf you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( pointing to his four hoods ) These are my lawyers  --  all Harvard men . Mulligan and the two policemen lead Spats and his Harvard men out . Policemen , under the supervision of the captain , are herding customers into a paddy-wagon outside the funeral parlor . Fighting his way out of the wagon is the drunk , waving his coffee cup in the air . &nbsp; DRUNKI want another cup of coffee . He staggers into the alley , toward the side entrance of the speakeasy . Through the smashed-up side door , policemen are ushering more customers , waiters , musicians and the dancing girls . Joe and Jerry , carrying their instruments and overcoats , have just climbed through a window on to a second floor fire escape , and are inspecting the scene below . The shot-up hearse is parked directly beneath them . Stealthily they climb down  --  13  --  the ladder , drop to the roof of the hearse . Then they scramble over the radiator , steal down the alley away from the street . They stop in the shadows to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . We do n't have to worry about who to pay first . &nbsp; JOEQuiet  --  I 'm thinking . &nbsp; JERRYOf course , the landlady is going to lock us out  --  Moe said no more knackwurst on credit , and we ca n't borrow any more from the girls , because they 're on their way to jail  --  &nbsp; JOEShut up , will you ? I wonder how much Sam the Bookie will give us for our overcoats ? &nbsp; JERRYSam the Bookie ? Nothing doing ! You 're not putting my overcoat on that dog ! &nbsp; JOEI told you  --  it 's a sure thing . &nbsp; JERRYBut we 'll freeze  --  it 's below zero  --  we 'll catch pneumonia . &nbsp; JOELook , stupid , he 's ten to one . Tomorrow , we 'll have twenty overcoats ! Section Details EXTERIOR The next day , the street is covered with snow . Joe and Jerry , without overcoats , the collars of their tuxedos turned up against the bitter cold , come down the steps of the elevated , carrying their instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he is boiling over inside . As they proceed along the sidewalk , Jerry finally ca n't hold it any more . &nbsp; JERRYGreased Lightning ! Why do I listen to you ? I ought to have my head examined ! &nbsp; JOEI thought you were n't talking to me.  --  14  --  &nbsp; JERRYLook at the bull fiddle  --  it 's dressed warmer than I am . They come up to a building in front of which are gathered several small groups of shivering musicians , also equipped with instruments . Joe and Jerry exchange frozen waves with their colleagues , start through the entrance . Joe moves down the corridor , Jerry tagging along grimly beside him . Other job-seeking musicians mill around , and a melange of musical sounds and singing voices issues from the various offices , studios and rehearsal halls . Joe and Jerry come up to a door marked : KEYNOTE MUSICAL AGENCY  --  BANDS , SOLOISTS , SINGERS . Joe opens the door , revealing a crummy office , with a secretary behind a desk . &nbsp; JOEAnything today ? &nbsp; FIRST SECRETARYNothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they shuffle along to the next agency , which is marked : JULES STEIN  --  MUSIC CORPORATION OF AMERICA .

He closes the door and starts toward the next office , but Jerry stops . &nbsp; JERRYI ca n't go on , Joe . I 'm weak from hunger and I 'm running a fever and I got a hole in my shoe  --  &nbsp; JOEIf you 'd give me a chance , we could be living like kings . &nbsp; JERRYYeah  --  how ?  --  15  --  &nbsp; JOEThere 's a dog running in the third race named Galloping Ghost  --  &nbsp; JERRYOh , no ! &nbsp; JOEHe 's fifteen to one .

He opens the door to the next agency . On the door it says : SIG POLIAKOFF  --  BANDS FOR ALL OCCASIONS . There is the usual secretary behind the usual desk , and her name is Nellie . She is a brunette , somewhat past her prime , but still attractive . &nbsp; JOEAnything today ? &nbsp; NELLIE ( looking up ) Oh , it 's you ! You got a lot of nerve  --  &nbsp; JOEThank you . He shuts the door quickly , starts to move on . &nbsp; NELLIE 'S VOICE ( from inside ) Joe  --  come back here ! Joe stops in his tracks . With a resigned shrug to Jerry , he opens the door again , and the two of them start in . Beside Nellie , there is another secretary pecking away at a typewriter . Nellie 's face is grim as Joe and Jerry come up .  --  16  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Saturday night  --  I can explain everything . &nbsp; NELLIE ( to Jerry ; pointing at Joe ) What a heel !

Sitting behind the desk , speaking urgently into the phone , is Sig Poliakoff , a gruff , likeable man in his fifties . Pacing up and down on the other side of the desk is Sweet Sue , a flashily-dressed broad , who has seen thirty summers and a few hard winters . As she paces , she nervously flips a large white pill from one hand to the other . Slouched in a chair is Bienstock , a somewhat prissy man of forty wearing thick glasses . He has a card file on his lap , is thumbing through it . &nbsp; POLIAKOFF ( into phone ) Look , Gladys , it 's three weeks in Florida  --  Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators  --  they need a couple of girls on sax and bass  --  what do you mean , who is this ?

The other four players also jump up , and pulling their guns , level them at Joe and Jerry . &nbsp; TOOTHPICK CHARLIEAll right , you two  --  drop ' em .  --  25  --  &nbsp; JERRY ( stops ; puzzled ) Drop what ? &nbsp; JOEWe came to pick up a car . &nbsp; TOOTHPICK CHARLIEOh , yeah ? He nods to one of the mechanics , who steps up to Joe and Jerry , starts to open the instrument cases . &nbsp; JOENellie Weinmeyer 's car . &nbsp; MECHANIC ( as the bass and sax are revealed ) Musicians . &nbsp; TOOTHPICK CHARLIEWise guys ! He mops his brow with the back of his sleeve , and putting his gun back in the holster , picks up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pair of aces bets . The other players resume their seats . Joe and Jerry follow the mechanic toward the parked cars . &nbsp; JOEIt 's a ' 25 Hupmobile coupe . Green . The mechanic leads them up to the car , which is parked near the gas pump . &nbsp; MECHANICNeed some gas ? &nbsp; JERRYYeah. ( takes some coins out of pocket ) Like about forty cents ' worth . The mechanic unscrews the cap of the gas tank , inserts the rubber hose from the pump . &nbsp; MECHANICPut it on Miss Weinmeyer 's bill ?  --  26  --  &nbsp; JOEWhy not ? ( signals Jerry to put coins away ) And while you 're at it  --  fill ' er up . From the street outside comes the loud squeal of tires . Jerry glances off casually toward the entrance . A black Dusenberg bursts the chain hanging across the street entrance , skids into the garage , brakes to a screeching stop some ten feet from the card players . Toothpick Charlie and his cronies leap up and reach for their guns . Too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two armed with submachine guns , the other two with sawed-off shotguns . We recognize them as Spats Colombo 's henchmen . &nbsp; FIRST HENCHMANAll right , everybody hands up and face the wall . The frightened poker players start to obey . Jerry is watching the scene , open-mouthed . Joe grabs his shoulder , pulls him down behind the Hupmobile . The Second Henchman notices the mechanic standing petrified beside the gas pump . &nbsp; SECOND HENCHMAN ( waving machine gun ) Hey  --  join us ! The mechanic raises his hands , moves reluctantly toward the six men lined up against the wall . &nbsp; SECOND HENCHMAN ( continues ) Okay , boss . A pair of men 's feet step down from the limousine . They are encased in immaculate spats . Jerry , crouching behind the Hupmobile with Joe , grabs his arm . &nbsp; JERRY ( whispering ) It 's Spats Colombo  --  Joe clamps his hand over Jerry 's mouth . Spats Colombo joins his armed henchmen , who are covering the seven men facing the wall with their hands up .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie . Long time no see . &nbsp; TOOTHPICK CHARLIE ( glancing over his shoulder nervously ) What is it , Spats ? What do you want here ? &nbsp; SPATSJust dropped in to pay my respects . &nbsp; TOOTHPICK CHARLIEYou do n't owe me no nothing . &nbsp; SPATSOh , I would n't say that . You were nice enough to recommend my mortuary to some of your friends . . . He has strolled over to the table , and picking up the deck of cards , starts to deal out another round to the abandoned poker hands . &nbsp; TOOTHPICK CHARLIE ( sweating ) I do n't know what you 're talking about . &nbsp; SPATSSo now I got all those coffins on my hands  --  and I hate to see them go to waste . &nbsp; TOOTHPICK CHARLIEHonest , Spats . I had nothing to do with it . Spats deals Toothpick Charlie 's fifth card , then turns up the hole card . &nbsp; SPATSToo bad , Charlie . You would have had three eights. ( flips cards away ) Good-bye , Charlie ! &nbsp; TOOTHPICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no , no , no  --  ( a scream ) NO ! Spats nods , and the two machine-gunners raise their weapons , start to fire methodically . Behind the Hupmobile , Jerry screws his eyes shut painfully as the steady chatter of bullets continues .  --  28  --  &nbsp; JERRYI think I 'm going to be sick . The machine guns stop firing . There is a moment 's silence . Then suddenly , the gas tank of the Hupmobile overflows , and the rubber hose from the pump whips out , gushing gasoline over the floor . Spats and his henchmen , hearing the sound , whirl around and catch sight of Joe and Jerry squatting behind the car . &nbsp; SPATSAll right  --  come on out of there . Joe and Jerry emerge quakingly from behind the Hupmobile . They try to raise their hands , but find this rather difficult to manage while holding on to their instruments . Jerry darts a horrified glance toward the foot of the wall . &nbsp; JOE ( quickly ) We did n't see anything  --  ( to Jerry ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nothing . Besides , it 's none of our business if you guys want to knock each other off  --  Joe nudges him violently with his elbow , and he breaks off . &nbsp; SPATS ( studying them ) Do n't I know you two from somewhere ? &nbsp; JOEWe 're just a couple of musicians who came to pick up a car  --  Nellie Weinmeyer 's car  --  there 's a dance tonight  --  ( starting to edge away ) Come on , Jerry . &nbsp; SPATSWait a minute . Where do you think you 're going ? &nbsp; JOETo Urbana . It 's a hundred miles . &nbsp; SPATSYou ai n't going nowhere .  --  29  --  &nbsp; JERRY ( quavering ) We 're not ? &nbsp; SPATSThe only way you 'll get to Urbana is feet first . During this , one of the bodies huddled grotesquely against the foot of the wall begins to stir . It is Toothpick Charlie . He is covered with blood , but there is still a spark of life in him , and his toothpick is still clutched between his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the floor toward a phone on a wooden shelf . Spats and his gang , facing Joe and Jerry , are not aware of Charlie 's activity . &nbsp; SPATSI do n't like no witnesses . &nbsp; JOEWe wo n't breathe a word . &nbsp; SPATSYou wo n't breathe nothin '  --  not even air . He motions lazily to the Second Henchman . The henchman slowly levels his machine gun at Joe and Jerry , who stand frozen . At that very moment , Toothpick Charlie reaches up for the phone . But he is too weak to hold on , and the receiver drops from his limp hand , clattering to the asphalt floor . Instantly , Spats and his henchmen wheel around . Spats grabs the machine gun from the Second Henchman , and perforates what is left of Charlie with a hail of lead . Toothpick Charlie crumbles in a heap . He is quite dead . Spats ' be-spatted foot disdainfully kicks the toothpick out of Charlie 's mouth . Joe and Jerry have taken advantage of this momentary diversion . Like scalded jackasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their instruments . Spats and his boys pivot , see the two running . They let go with a salvo of shots , just as Joe and Jerry scoot through the garage door and disappear down the street . A couple of henchmen start after them . There is the sound of an approaching police siren .  --  30  --  &nbsp; SPATSCome on  --  let 's blow . We 'll take care of those guys later . They all pile into the black Dusenberg . The driver shifts into reverse and the car shoots backwards out of the garage . Joe and Jerry come skidding around the corner from Clark Street , race down the snow-covered alley . In the background there is the sound of squealing tires and police sirens . &nbsp; JERRY ( as they run ) I think they got me . &nbsp; JOEThey got the bull-fiddle . &nbsp; JERRY ( feeling himself all over ) You do n't see any blood ? &nbsp; JOENot yet . But if those guys catch us , there 'll be blood all over . Type O. They start running even faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOEAs far away as possible . &nbsp; JERRYThat 's not far enough . You do n't know those guys ! But they know us . Every hood in Chicago will be looking for us  --  They reach the end of the alley . A couple of motorcycle policemen , their sirens wailing , flash by in the direction of the garage . The word must have spread , because pedestrians are also running in the same direction . Joe stops , looks around quickly , and seeing a cigar store on the corner drags Jerry inside . Joe hurries to a wall telephone near the entrance . Jerry follows breathlessly . &nbsp; JOEGot a nickel ? He sets the saxophone case down , and taking a coin from Jerry , inserts it in the slot .  --  31  --  &nbsp; JERRYYou going to call the police ? &nbsp; JOEThe police ? We 'd never live to testify . Not against Spats Colombo . ( into phone ) Wabash 1098 . &nbsp; JERRYWe got to get out of town . Maybe we ought to grow beards . &nbsp; JOEWe are going out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; JERRYShave ? At a time like this ? Those guys got machine guns  --  they 're going to blast our heads off  --  and you want to shave ? &nbsp; JOEShave our legs , stupid . Stupid is right . Jerry still does n't get it . &nbsp; JOE ( into phone ; his voice a tremulous soprano ) Hello ? Mr. Poliakoff ? I understand you 're looking for a couple of girl musicians . Now Jerry gets it . Section Details AT THE CHICAGO RAILROAD PLATFORM Two pairs of high-heeled shoes , unusually large in size , are hurrying along the platform . Gradually revealed are rather hefty legs in rolled stockings , short dresses , coats with cheap fur pieces , and rakish cloche hats . One of the pair carries a saxophone case , the other a bull-fiddle case , and each has a Gladstone bag . A train , with steam up , is loading for departure . &nbsp; ANNOUNCER 'S VOICEFlorida Limited leaving on Track Seven for Washington , Charleston , Savannah , Jacksonville and Miami . All aboard . All aboard . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not too adept at navigating in high heels . Suddenly the one with the bull-fiddle twists her ankle  --  or we should say  --  32  --  his ankle  --  because it 's Jerry . He stops and faces his girl-friend  --  Joe . &nbsp; JERRY ( rubbing his ankle ) How can they walk on these things ? How do they keep their balance ? &nbsp; JOEMust be the way their weight is distributed . Come on . As they proceed along the platform , a gust of wind sends their skirts billowing . Jerry stops again and pulls his skirt down . &nbsp; JERRYAnd it 's so drafty . They must be catching colds all the time . &nbsp; JOE ( urging him on ) Quit stalling . We 'll miss the train . &nbsp; JERRYI feel so naked . Like everybody 's looking at me . &nbsp; JOEWith those legs ? Are you crazy ? They are now approaching the Pullman car reserved for the girls ' orchestra . Girl musicians , with instruments and luggage , are boarding the car , supervised by Sweet Sue and Bienstock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no use . We 'll never get away with it , Joe . &nbsp; JOEThe name is Josephine . And it was your idea in the first place . Just then , a member of the girls ' band comes hurrying past them , carrying a valise and a ukulele case . Her name is Sugar . What can we say about Sugar , except that she is the dream girl of every red-blooded American male who ever read College Humor ? As she undulates past them , Jerry looks after her with dismay . &nbsp; JERRYWho are we kidding ? Look at that  --  look how she moves  --  it 's like jello on springs  --  they must have some sort of a built-in motor . I tell you it 's a whole different sex .  --  33  --  &nbsp; JOEWhat are you afraid of ? Nobody 's asking you to have a baby . This is just to get out of town . The minute we hit Florida , we 'll blow this set-up . &nbsp; JERRYThis time I 'm not going to let you talk me into something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peddling his papers . &nbsp; NEWSBOYExtra ! Extra ! Seven slaughtered in North Side garage ! Fear bloody aftermath ! &nbsp; JERRY ( to Joe , promptly ) You talked me into it ! Come on , Josephine ! &nbsp; JOEAtta girl , Geraldine . They hurry toward the Pullman car , imitating the jello-on-springs movement as well as they can . At the Pullman car , Sue and Bienstock are checking in the girl musicians as they are boarding . &nbsp; SUEHi , Mary Lou  --  Rosella  --  Okay , Dolores , get a move on  --  How 's your back , Olga ? &nbsp; BIENSTOCK ( checking list ) Clarinet  --  drums  --  trumpet  --  trombone  --  Joe and Jerry come mincing up . ( Note : From here on in , the two speak with girls ' voices whenever the situation calls for it . ) &nbsp; JOEWell , here we are . &nbsp; SUEYou two from the Poliakoff Agency ? &nbsp; JOEYes , we 're the new girls . &nbsp; JERRYBrand new . &nbsp; SUEThis is our manager , Mr. Bienstock . I 'm Sweet Sue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jerry smiles back brightly . &nbsp; BIENSTOCK ( checking list ) Saxophone , bass  --  Am I glad to see you girls . You saved our lives . &nbsp; JOELikewise , I 'm sure . &nbsp; SUEWhere did you girls play before ? &nbsp; JERRYOh  --  here and there  --  and around . &nbsp; JOEWe spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music . &nbsp; BIENSTOCKYou 're in berths 7 and 7A . &nbsp; JERRY ( his idea of a lady ) Thank you ever so . &nbsp; BIENSTOCKYou 're welcome . &nbsp; JERRYIt 's entirely mutual . Joe has already boarded the car . As Jerry starts up the steps , he stumbles . Bienstock helps him up , with a little pat on the behind . &nbsp; BIENSTOCKUpsy-daisy . &nbsp; JERRY ( coyly ) Fresh ! Joe jerks him up into the vestibule before this nonsense gets out of hand .  --  35  --  &nbsp; BIENSTOCK ( takes off glasses , puts them in pocket ) Looks like Poliakoff came through with a couple of real ladies . &nbsp; SUEYou better tell the other girls to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pullman . The porter picks up the yellow footstep , hops aboard , and the train starts moving . As Joe and Jerry come in from the vestibule , Joe grabs Jerry , holds him against the baggage rack . &nbsp; JOE ( an angry whisper ) DAPHNE ? &nbsp; JERRYI never did like the name Geraldine . As Sue and Bienstock appear from the vestibule , Joe lets go of Jerry , and they move down the aisle into the Pullman car proper . The girl musicians are all there , except for Sugar . They are removing their coats , settling themselves in their seats , putting away their instruments and baggage . They are all blonde , they are young , and most of them are pretty . They look like a band of angels  --  but do n't you believe it . &nbsp; JERRY ( the good neighbor ) Hello , everybody . I 'm the bass fiddle . Just call me Daphne . &nbsp; JOEI 'm Josephine . Sax . There is a slew of general hellos . &nbsp; MARY LOUWelcome to No Man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sor-ry ! &nbsp; ROSELLATake your corsets off and spread out .  --  36  --  &nbsp; JERRYOh , I never wear one . &nbsp; OLGADo n't you bulge ? &nbsp; JERRYOh , no . I have the most divine little seamstress that comes in once a month  --  and my dear , she 's so inexpensive  --  &nbsp; JOECome on , Daphne . &nbsp; DOLORESSay , kids , have you heard the one about the girl tuba player that was stranded on a desert island with a one-legged jockey ? &nbsp; JERRYNo  --  how does it go ? &nbsp; BIENSTOCK ( coming up ) Now cut that out , girls  --  none of that rough talk . ( as Joe and Jerry move off ) They went to a conservatory . There is a general horse-laugh from the girls . Joe and Jerry have now reached their seats , and are taking off their coats . &nbsp; JERRY ( in a delighted whisper ) How about that talent ? This is like falling into a tub of butter . &nbsp; JOEWatch it , Daphne ! &nbsp; JERRYWhen I was a kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locked up in this pastry shop overnight , with all kinds of goodies around . . . jelly rolls and mocha eclairs and sponge cake and Boston cream pie and cherry tarts  --  &nbsp; JOEListen , stupe  --  no butter and no pastry . We 're on a diet ! Jerry starts to hang his coat across a cord running above the window .  --  37  --  &nbsp; JOE ( grabbing him ) Not there  --  that 's the emergency brake . &nbsp; JERRY ( clutching bosom ) Now you 've done it ! &nbsp; JOEDone what ? &nbsp; JERRYTore off one of my chests . &nbsp; JOEYou better go fix it . &nbsp; JERRYYou better come help me . Jerry leads the way toward the rest rooms , which are just beyond their seat . Instinctively he heads for the one marked MEN . Joe grabs him , steers him back toward the one marked WOMEN . &nbsp; JOEThis way , Daphne . &nbsp; JERRY ( clasping his chest desperately ) Now you tore the other one . Joe opens the curtain , propels him inside . There is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the leather settee , her skirt is slightly raised , and she is about to remove a small silver flask tucked under her garter . As Jerry and Joe come in , she guiltily pulls her skirt down . &nbsp; SUGAROH ! &nbsp; JERRY ( arms folded across chest ) Terribly sorry . &nbsp; SUGAR ( relieved ) That 's all right . I was afraid it was Sweet Sue . You wo n't tell anybody , will you ?  --  38  --  &nbsp; JOETell what ? &nbsp; SUGAR ( taking the flask out and unscrewing the cap ) If they catch me once more , they 'll boot me out of the band . ( pours a drink into a paper cup ) You the replacement for the bass and the sax ? &nbsp; JERRYThat 's us . I 'm Daphne  --  and this is Josephine . &nbsp; SUGARI 'm Sugar Cane . &nbsp; JOESugar Cane ? &nbsp; SUGARI changed it . It used to be Sugar Kowalczyk . &nbsp; JERRYPolish ? &nbsp; SUGARYes . I come from a very musical family . My mother is a piano teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he conduct ? &nbsp; SUGAROn the Baltimore and Ohio . &nbsp; JOEOh . &nbsp; SUGARI play the ukulele . And I sing too . &nbsp; JERRY ( to Joe ) She sings , too . &nbsp; SUGARI do n't really have much of a voice  --  but then it 's not much of a band , either . I 'm only with ' em because I 'm running away . &nbsp; JOERunning away ? From what ?  --  39  --  &nbsp; SUGARDo n't get me started on that . ( extending flask ) Want a drink ? It 's bourbon . As Jerry reaches for it , his bosom starts to slip again , and he quickly refolds his arms . &nbsp; JERRYWe 'll take a rain check . &nbsp; SUGAR ( downs cupful of bourbon ) I do n't want you to think that I 'm a drinker . I can stop any time I want to  --  only I do n't want to . Especially when I 'm blue . &nbsp; JOEWe understand . &nbsp; SUGARAll the girls drink  --  but I 'm the one that gets caught . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the fuzzy end of the lollipop . She has screwed the cap back on the flask , and now slips it under her garter . &nbsp; SUGARAre my seams straight ? &nbsp; JERRY ( examining her legs ) I 'll say . &nbsp; SUGARSee you around , girls . She waves and exits into the Pullman car . &nbsp; JERRYBye , Sugar . ( to Joe ) We been playing with the wrong bands . &nbsp; JOEDown , Daphne ! &nbsp; JERRYHow about the shape of that liquor cabinet ? Joe spins him around , and unbuttoning the back of his dress , starts to fix the slipped brassiere.  --  40  --  &nbsp; JOEForget it . One false move , and they 'll toss us off the train  --  there 'll be the police , and the papers , and the mob in Chicago . . . &nbsp; JERRY ( not listening ) Boy , would I like to borrow a cup of that Sugar . &nbsp; JOE ( whirling him around , grabbing the front of his dress ) Look  --  no butter , no pastry , and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pathetically ) You tore it again ! A little later , at one end of the car , Sweet Sue and her Society Syncopators are beating out " Running Wild . " It is a special rehearsal to break in the two new girls , Josephine and Daphne . The other girls , including Sugar on the ukulele , are really swinging . But Joe and Jerry are playing in a dainty ultra-refined manner , so as not to give themselves away . Sue , who is conducting from the aisle , raps her baton against a seat . The girls stop playing . &nbsp; SUE ( to Joe and Jerry ) Hey , Sheboygan  --  you two  --  what was your last job  --  playing square dances ? &nbsp; JOENo  --  funerals . &nbsp; SUEWould you mind rejoining the living ? Goose it up a little . &nbsp; JERRYWe 'll try . Sue is about to give the downbeat , when her eyes fall on Jerry 's bass fiddle . There is a neat row of bullet holes across the face of the instrument . &nbsp; SUEHow did those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking down ) Oh  --  those . I do n't know . ( tentatively ) Mice ? &nbsp; JOE ( quickly ) She got it second-hand . &nbsp; SUEAll right  --  let 's take it from the top . And put a little heat under it , will you ? She brings the baton down , and the girls start playing again . This time Joe and Jerry give it both knees  --  Joe going for a wild ride on the sax , and Jerry slapping and twirling the bass like a girl possessed . Sue cocks her eyebrows , amazed by the hepness of the two conservatory cats . Now it is time for Sugar 's solo . She steps forward with the ukulele , and starts to sing a hot chorus of " Running Wild . " Holding on to the bull-fiddle , Jerry leans forward to get a better view of Sugar 's backfield in motion . As Sugar shimmies through the number , the hidden flask slips out from under her garter , and falls to the floor with a clank . She freezes . Sue raps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; SUEBIENSTOCK ! Bienstock , with his glasses on , is sitting farther back in the car reading Variety . He leaps up . &nbsp; BIENSTOCKYes , Sue ? What is it ? &nbsp; SUE ( pointing at flask ) I thought I made it clear I do n't want any drinking in this outfit . &nbsp; BIENSTOCK ( picking up flask ) All right , girls . Who does this belong to ? ( no answer )  --  42  --  Come on , LOW . Speak up . ( still no answer ; his eyes fall on Sugar , who stands there frozen ) Sugar , I warned you ! &nbsp; SUGARPlease , Mr. Bienstock  --  &nbsp; BIENSTOCKThis is the last straw . In Kansas City you were smuggling liquor in a shampoo bottle . Before that I caught you with a pint in your ukulele  --  Jerry has squeezed himself between the girls , and steps forward . &nbsp; JERRYPardon me , Mr. Bienstock  --  can I have my flask back ? &nbsp; BIENSTOCK ( automatically ) Sure . ( hands it to him , turns back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we come to  --  ( He does a take , turns to Jerry ) Your flask ? &nbsp; JERRYUh-huh . Just a little bourbon . He starts to slip it down the neck of his dress . &nbsp; BIENSTOCKGive me that ! He grabs the flask . Sugar is looking at Jerry gratefully . Joe glares at Jerry , ready to hit him with the saxophone . &nbsp; SUE ( to Joe and Jerry ; dryly ) Did n't you girls say you went to a conservatory ? &nbsp; JERRYYes . For a whole year . &nbsp; SUEI thought you said three years . &nbsp; JOE ( lightly ) We got time off for good behavior.  --  43  --  &nbsp; SUEThere are two things I will not put up with during working hours . One is liquor  --  and the other one is men . &nbsp; JERRY ( a blinking angel ) Men ? &nbsp; JOEOh , you do n't have to worry about that . &nbsp; JERRYWe would n't be caught dead with men . Those rough , hairy beasts with eight hands  --  ( looking at Bienstock ) They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BIENSTOCK ( drawing himself up ) I beg your pardon . &nbsp; SUE ( rapping baton ) All right , girls  --  from the top again . Once more the Society Syncopators wade into " Running Wild . " Sugar , strumming the ukulele , smiles warmly at Daphne , a true blue pal ; Daphne smiles back , his mouth watering a little , like a kid in a pastry shop . pp. 1-24 &nbsp; pp. 44-64 INTERIOR  --  TRAIN After the rehearsal , the berths are made up , and the girls get ready for bed . Joe , in pajamas , is standing in the aisle beside Lower 7 , draping his dress neatly on a hanger . Jerry , in a nightgown , is lying in Upper 7 with the curtains open , watching the broads go by . Girls in negligees , in pajamas , in night-gowns , are scurrying with their wash-kits in and out of the ladies ' room , climbing into lowers and uppers . &nbsp; JERRY ( the young sultan ) Good night , Mary Lou  --  Dolores dear , sleep tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an upper ) Toodle-oo . &nbsp; JERRY ( to Joe ) How about that toodle-oo ?  --  44  --  &nbsp; JOESteady , boy . Just keep telling yourself you 're a girl . &nbsp; JERRY ( to himself ) I 'm a girl . I 'm a girl . I 'm a girl  --  Rosella and Olga come bouncing past from the ladies ' room . &nbsp; JERRY ( to Joe ) Get a load of that rhythm section . ( a glare from Joe ) I 'm a girl . I 'm a girl . I 'm a girl . His eyes stray down the aisle . In Upper 2 , Sugar is getting ready for bed . All Jerry can see is her legs dangling out of the berth , as she removes her stockings . But that 's all the identification Jerry needs . &nbsp; JERRY ( calling down the aisle ) Good night , Sugar . &nbsp; SUGAR ( sticking her head out ) Good night , honey . &nbsp; JERRY ( to Joe ; enraptured ) Honey  --  she called me honey . Without a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slides it under the lower . &nbsp; JERRYWhat are you doing ? &nbsp; JOEI just want to make sure that honey stays in the hive . There 'll be no buzzing around tonight . &nbsp; JERRYBut suppose I got to go  --  like for a drink of water ? &nbsp; JOEFight it . &nbsp; JERRYBut suppose I lose ? Suppose it 's an emergency ?  --  45  --  &nbsp; JOE ( points to cord running across the back of Jerry 's berth ) Then pull the emergency brake ! Sitting on the edge of Lower 1 , ready for bed , is Sue . She is looking off intently toward Joe and Jerry , flipping a stomach pill in one hand and holding a paper cup of water in the other . She turns to Bienstock , who is across the aisle in Lower 2 , just buttoning his pajama tops . &nbsp; SUEYou know , Bienstock , there 's something funny about those two new girls . &nbsp; BIENSTOCKFunny ? In what way ? &nbsp; SUEI do n't know  --  but I can feel it right here . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it 's like a burglar alarm going off inside you . She swallows the pill , washes it down with water . &nbsp; BIENSTOCKAll right , Sue . You watch your ulcers  --  I 'll watch those two . ( rises , claps his hands ) Okay . Everybody settle down and go to bed . Good night , girls . The last few girls climb into their berths , lights are being extinguished , curtains are being closed . Joe , standing outside Berth 7 , starts to close the curtains of Jerry 's berth . &nbsp; JOEGood night , Daphne . &nbsp; JERRY ( wretchedly ) Good night , Josephine . Joe closes the curtains . Jerry , in the upper , extinguishes the light . He settles himself back on the pillow , closes his eyes .  --  46  --  &nbsp; JERRY ( muttering to himself ) I 'm a girl  --  I 'm a girl  --  I wish I were dead  --  I 'm a girl  --  I 'm a girl  --  There are just a few dim lights illuminating the aisle . Everybody seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's steady snoring in Lower 2 . After a moment , the curtains of Upper 2 open , and Sugar peeks out cautiously . She is wearing a negligee over her nightie . Seeing that all is clear , she slips quietly down the ladder , and tiptoes down the aisle . She arrives at Berth 7 , and finding no ladder there , takes one from across the aisle , leans it against Jerry 's berth , and climbs up . Jerry is asleep in Upper 7 , as the curtains part and Sugar leans in . &nbsp; SUGAR ( a whisper ) Daphne . . . She taps his shoulder . Jerry sits bolt upright , hits his head against the top of the berth . &nbsp; JERRYOh  --  Sugar ! &nbsp; SUGARI wanted to thank you for covering up for me . You 're a real pal . &nbsp; JERRYIt 's nothing . I just think us girls should stick together . &nbsp; SUGARIf it had n't been for you , they would have kicked me off the train . I 'd be out there in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be freezing outside . When I think of you  --  and your poor ukulele  --   --  47  --  &nbsp; SUGARIf there 's anything I can do for you  --  &nbsp; JERRYOh , I can think of a million things  --  Sugar , looking off , sees something in the aisle , quickly climbs into the berth beside Jerry . &nbsp; JERRYAnd that 's one of them . &nbsp; SUGAR ( finger to her lips ) Sssh . Sweet Sue . She peers through the slit in the curtains . Sue , in a wrapper , is padding sleepily down the aisle toward the ladies ' room . Back in Upper 7 , Sugar turns conspiratorially to Jerry . &nbsp; SUGARI do n't want her to know we 're in cahoots . &nbsp; JERRYWe wo n't tell anybody  --  not even Josephine . &nbsp; SUGARI 'd better stay here till she goes back to sleep . &nbsp; JERRYStay as long as you like . &nbsp; SUGAR ( putting her legs under the covers ) I 'm not crowding you , am I ? &nbsp; JERRYNo . It 's nice and cozy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold nights like this , I used to crawl into bed with my sister . We 'd cuddle up under the covers , and pretend we were lost in a dark cave , and were trying to find our way out . &nbsp; JERRY ( mopping his brow ) Interesting .  --  48  --  &nbsp; SUGARAnything wrong ? &nbsp; JERRYNo , no . &nbsp; SUGAR ( putting a hand on his shoulder ) Why you poor thing  --  you 're trembling all over . &nbsp; JERRYThat 's ridiculous . &nbsp; SUGARAnd your head is hot . &nbsp; JERRYThat 's ridiculous . &nbsp; SUGAR ( her feet touching his under the cover ) And you 've got cold feet . &nbsp; JERRY ( a wan smile ) Is n't that ridiculous ? &nbsp; SUGARLet me warm them a little . ( rubbing her feet against his ) There  --  is n't that better ? Jerry has turned his head away , and is now mumbling to himself . &nbsp; JERRYI 'm a girl , I 'm a girl , I 'm a girl  --  &nbsp; SUGARWhat did you say ? &nbsp; JERRYI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up ) Maybe I 'd better go before I catch something . &nbsp; JERRY ( holding her by the arm ) I 'm not that sick .  --  49  --  &nbsp; SUGARI have a very low resistance . &nbsp; JERRYLook , Sugar , if you feel you 're coming down with something , the best thing is a shot of whiskey . &nbsp; SUGARYou got some ? &nbsp; JERRYI know where to get some . ( sitting up ) Do n't move . He climbs across her , and opening the curtains , leans all the way over the edge of the upper berth and down towards the berth below . In Lower 7 , Joe is asleep , facing the window . The curtains part , and Jerry , dangling upside down , reaches toward the suitcase at the foot of the berth . He raises the lid of the suitcase , rummages around till he finds a bottle of bourbon . As he takes it out , Joe stirs . Jerry freezes , raises the bottle up , ready to conk Joe if he wakes up . Joe turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body through the curtains . Jerry , the bottle clutched in his hand , is hanging upside down , while Sugar in the upper berth holds on to his legs . As Jerry tries to raise himself back up , he slips out of Sugar 's grasp , and sprawls in the aisle . He lies absolutely still , afraid that Joe may have heard him . &nbsp; SUGAR ( a solicitous whisper ) You all right ? &nbsp; JERRY ( getting up ) I 'm fine . &nbsp; SUGARHow 's the bottle ? &nbsp; JERRYHalf-full . As he hands it up to her , the curtains of Upper 4 part , and Dolores , who has been awakened by the fall , peeks out .  --  50  --  &nbsp; SUGAR ( to Jerry ) You better get some cups . Jerry pads over to the water fountain beside the rest rooms . He punches out a couple of paper cups from a dispenser , flits back to Berth 7 , and scurries up the ladder . Dolores watches all this with great interest . Back in Upper 7 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handing her the paper cups ) I tell you  --  this is the only way to travel . &nbsp; SUGAR ( pouring ) You better put on the lights . I ca n't see what I 'm doing . &nbsp; JERRYNo  --  no lights . We do n't want anyone to know we 're having a party . &nbsp; SUGARI may spill something . &nbsp; JERRY ( shifting into high ) So spill it . Spills , thrills , laughs , games  --  this may even turn out to be a surprise party . &nbsp; SUGARWhat 's the surprise ? &nbsp; JERRY ( coyly ) Uh-uh . Not yet . &nbsp; SUGARWhen ? &nbsp; JERRYWe better have a drink first . &nbsp; SUGAR ( handing him cup ) Here . This 'll put hair on your chest .  --  51  --  &nbsp; JERRYNo fair guessing . They drink . The curtains open and Dolores , standing on the ladder outside , sticks her head in . &nbsp; DOLORESThis a private clambake , or can anybody join ? &nbsp; JERRY ( turns , startled ) It 's private . Go away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vermouth ? &nbsp; DOLORESSure . &nbsp; JERRYWho needs vermouth ? &nbsp; SUGAR ( to Dolores ) We have some bourbon  --  let 's make Manhattans . &nbsp; DOLORESOkay. ( starts down the ladder ) &nbsp; JERRYManhattans ? This time of night ? &nbsp; SUGAR ( calling after Dolores ) And bring the cocktail shaker . &nbsp; JERRY ( disgustedly ) Oh , Sugar . You 're going to spoil my surprise . Dolores has crossed the aisle , and getting a foot up on Lower 4 , reaches up into her berth for the vermouth . The curtains of Lower 4 open , and Mary Lou sticks her head out . &nbsp; MARY LOUWhat 's up ? &nbsp; DOLORESParty in Upper 7.  --  52  --  &nbsp; MARY LOUI got some cheese and crackers . &nbsp; DOLORESAnd get a corkscrew . Mary Lou gets out of her berth , steps across to Lower 3 , wakes up Rosella . &nbsp; MARY LOUParty in Upper 7 . Got a corkscrew ? &nbsp; ROSELLA ( wide awake ) No . But Stella has . &nbsp; MARY LOUGet some cups . Rosella hurries toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corkscrew out of bed . Rapidly , the whole Pullman car springs into action . As silent as mice , the girls slip out of their berths , armed with various provisions . Their nighties billowing , they scuttle down the aisle and up the ladder into Upper 7 . In Upper 7 , the party is building rapidly , as the mice pile in with their contributions . &nbsp; GIRLSHere 's the vermouth . I brought some crackers and cheese . Will ten cups be enough ? Can you use a bottle of Southern Comfort ? Jerry is trying vainly to stem the invasion of gate-crashers . &nbsp; JERRYPlease , girls , this is a private party  --  a party for two . Go away , no more room  --  Please , no crackers in bed  --  Go someplace else , form your own party  --  Be careful with that corkscrew ! Sugar  --  where are you , Sugar ? Sugar is greeting Olga , who has climbed into the berth clutching a hot water bottle . &nbsp; OLGAHere 's the cocktail shaker . Sugar starts measuring bourbon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vermouth . If we only had some ice  --  Pass the peanut butter . Anybody for salami ? &nbsp; JERRY ( desperately ) Thirteen girls in a berth  --  that 's bad luck ! Twelve of you will have to get out ! Please , girls , no more food ! I 'll have ants in the morning ! In Lower 7 , Joe is stirring restlessly , while subdued noises float down from the party upstairs . The curtains part and Emily sticks her head in and shakes Joe . &nbsp; EMILYHey  --  you got any maraschino cherries on you ? &nbsp; JOE ( half-asleep ) Huh ? &nbsp; EMILYNever mind . She disappears . Joe starts to close his eyes , then sits up with a jolt . &nbsp; JOEMaraschino cherries ? Slowly he becomes aware of the sounds of revelry up above . His eyes widen as he sees a girl 's bare leg through the curtains . The girl steps on the edge of his berth , hoists herself into the upper . Joe throws open the curtains , sees several other pairs of girls ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs climbing up the ladder . Frantically , Joe jumps out of his berth . He is confronted by a sight which knocks into a cocked hat the principle that two bodies can not occupy the same space at the same time . In a triumph of engineering , fourteen girls have squeezed themselves into Upper 7  --  or to be exact , thirteen girls and Daphne  --  not to mention the bourbon , the vermouth , the Southern Comfort , the paper cups , the corkscrew , the hot water bottle , the crackers and cheese , and the salami . There is a seething tangle of arms and legs and blonde heads  --  like a snake pit at feeding time .  --  54  --  &nbsp; JOEWhat 's going on here ? ( trying to find a needle in the haystack ) Daphne  --  Daphne  --  &nbsp; JERRY ( sticking his head out ) It 's not my fault . I did n't invite them . &nbsp; JOE ( pleading ) Break it up , girls ! Daphne ! Come on , help me ! He starts to tug at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the berth . &nbsp; JERRYAll right , girls . You heard Josephine . Everybody out . Sugar starts to back out of the berth . &nbsp; JERRYNot you , Sugar . &nbsp; SUGARI 'm just going to get some ice . Joe has slipped on his robe as Sugar comes backing out of the berth and down the ladder . &nbsp; JOEOut , out ! That 's right , Sugar . Now the rest of you . As Sugar heads for the water fountain , Joe starts to pull the other girls out . &nbsp; GIRLSAw , do n't be a flat tire . Have a Manhattan . Come on in . There 's lots of room in the back . &nbsp; JOESsh , Pipe down . We 'll all be fired . Jerry sticks his head out , looks after Sugar . &nbsp; JERRY ( plaintively ) Sugar  --  do n't leave me here alone , Sugar . Sugar has pried open the panel under the water fountain , and reaching inside , drags out a huge cake of ice . Not quite  --  55  --  knowing what to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and turns quickly to the pile of instruments stashed between some empty seats . &nbsp; JOE ( unaware of the cake of ice in his hands ) Come on , kids . Give up , will you ? The party 's over . Everybody go home . ( suddenly notices the ice ) What 's this ? By this time , Sugar has unscrewed a cymbal from the drum , and is holding the drummer 's metal brush . &nbsp; SUGAR ( beckoning to Joe ) Josephine , over here . Before it melts . She heads for the women 's lounge . Joe looks at her , looks at the ice , and not knowing what else to do with it , follows her through the curtains . &nbsp; SUGAR ( pointing to sunken washbowl ) Put it here . &nbsp; JOE ( dropping the ice in the bowl ) Sugar , you 're going to get yourself into a lot of trouble . &nbsp; SUGARBetter keep a lookout . Joe crosses to the curtain , peers out . Sugar , using the handle of the metal brush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JOEIf Bienstock catches you again  --  What 's the matter with you , anyway ? &nbsp; SUGARI 'm not very bright , I guess . &nbsp; JOEI would n't say that . Careless , maybe . &nbsp; SUGARNo  --  just dumb . If I had any brains , I would n't be on this crummy train with this crummy girls ' band . &nbsp; JOEThen why did you take this job ?  --  56  --  &nbsp; SUGARI used to sing with male bands . But I ca n't afford it any more . &nbsp; JOEAfford it ? &nbsp; SUGARHave you ever been with a male band ? &nbsp; JOEMe ? &nbsp; SUGARThat 's what I 'm running away from . I worked with six different ones in the last two years . Oh , brother ! &nbsp; JOERough ? &nbsp; SUGARI 'll say . &nbsp; JOEYou ca n't trust those guys . &nbsp; SUGARI ca n't trust myself . The moment I 'd start with a new band  --  bingo ! &nbsp; JOEBingo ? &nbsp; SUGARYou see , I have this thing about saxophone players . &nbsp; JOE ( abandoning his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what it is , but they just curdle me . All they have to do is play eight bars of " Come to Me My Melancholy Baby "  --  and my spine turns to custard , and I get goose-pimply all over  --  and I come to them . &nbsp; JOEThat so ? &nbsp; SUGAR ( hitting her head ) Every time !  --  57  --  &nbsp; JOE ( nonchalantly ) You know  - -  I play tenor sax . &nbsp; SUGARBut you 're a girl , thank goodness . &nbsp; JOE ( his throat drying up ) Yeah . &nbsp; SUGARThat 's why I joined this band . Safety first . Anything to get away from those bums . &nbsp; JOE ( drier yet ) Yeah . &nbsp; SUGAR ( hacking the ice viciously ) You do n't know what they 're like . You fall for them and you love ' em  --  you think it 's going to be the biggest thing since the Graf Zeppelin  --  and the next thing you know they 're borrowing money from you and spending it on other dames and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; SUGARThen one morning you wake up and the saxophone is gone and the guy is gone , and all that 's left behind is a pair of old socks and a tube of toothpaste , all squeezed out . &nbsp; JOEMen ! &nbsp; SUGARSo you pull yourself together and you go on to the next job , and the next saxophone player , and it 's the same thing all over again . See what I mean ? Not very bright . &nbsp; JOE ( looking her over ) Brains are n't everything . &nbsp; SUGARI can tell you one thing  --  it 's not going to happen to me again . Ever . I 'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop . Olga bursts in through the curtains .  --  58  --  &nbsp; OLGAIce ! What 's keeping the ice ? The natives are getting restless . Joe hands her the cymbal piled with ice . &nbsp; JOEHow about a couple of drinks for us ? &nbsp; OLGASure . She scoots out . Joe and Sugar are alone again . &nbsp; SUGARYou know I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; SUGARThat 's a quarter of a century . Makes a girl think . &nbsp; JOEAbout what ? &nbsp; SUGARAbout the future . You know  --  like a husband ? That 's why I 'm glad we 're going to Florida . &nbsp; JOEWhat 's in Florida ? &nbsp; SUGARMillionaires . Flocks of them . They all go south for the winter . Like birds . &nbsp; JOEGoing to catch yourself a rich bird ? &nbsp; SUGAROh , I do n't care how rich he is  --  as long as he has a yacht and his own private railroad car and his own toothpaste . &nbsp; JOEYou 're entitled . &nbsp; SUGARMaybe you 'll meet one too , Josephine . &nbsp; JOEYeah . With money like Rockefeller , and shoulders like Johnny Weismuller  --  &nbsp; SUGARI want mine to wear glasses .  --  59  --  &nbsp; JOEGlasses ? &nbsp; SUGARMen who wear glasses are so much more gentle and sweet and helpless . Have n't you ever noticed ? &nbsp; JOEWell , now that you 've mentioned it  --  &nbsp; SUGARThey get those weak eyes from reading  --  you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street Journal . Olga is back again , carrying two Manhattans in paper cups on the cymbal . She hands them the drinks , starts to refill the cymbal with ice . &nbsp; OLGAThat bass fiddle  --  wow ! She sure knows how to throw a party ! She dashes out . Joe looks after her , worriedly . &nbsp; SUGAR ( raising cup ) Happy days . &nbsp; JOE ( lifting his cup ) I hope this time you wind up with the sweet end of the lollipop . They drink . Joe studies her like a cat studying a canary . . . Olga is climbing up the ladder to Upper 7 with the new supply of ice in the cymbal . The party is now really winging . Amidst the hushed hilarity , the hot water bottle is being passed around , paper cups and crackers are flying , some of the girls are smoking . Despite the absence of Sugar , Jerry is enjoying himself hugely . Dolores has the floor  --  finishing the joke that Bienstock interrupted earlier . &nbsp; DOLORES.  --  so the one-legged jockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; JERRY ( eagerly ) What did he say ?  --  60  --  &nbsp; DOLORESThe one-legged jockey said , " Do n't worry about me , baby . I ride side-saddle . " To Jerry , this is excruciatingly comical . He puts his hand over his mouth , trying to smother his wild laughter , starts to hiccup . &nbsp; JERRY ( Lady Daphne again ) I beg your pardon . Another hiccup . And another . &nbsp; ROSELLAPut some ice on her neck ! She takes a hunk of ice out of the cymbal , rubs it against the back of Jerry 's neck . Jerry leaps up with a squeal , and the ice slides down into his nightgown . He squirms and wiggles , crying and laughing and hiccuping . &nbsp; JERRYOooh ! Aaah ! It 's cold ! Owwww ! The girls try to fish the ice from inside his nightie , and suddenly Jerry gets a new shock , worse than the ice . His hiccups stop , his eyes widen in panic . His bosoms have torn loose from their moorings again . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ward off exposure . &nbsp; JERRY ( continuing ) Cut it out , girls . Stop it . Joe  --  Josephine  --  help ! &nbsp; DOLORESHey , she 's ticklish ! With that , all the girls pounce on Jerry , start to tickle him . Jerry flops around like a fish , screaming and laughing and crying . In despair , his eyes fall on the emergency cord . He makes a grab for the cord , pulls it . The abrupt stop sends everybody in Upper 7 tumbling out into the aisle . In the lounge , Sugar is thrown off balance , and grabs on to Joe . &nbsp; SUGARWhat happened ?  --  61  --  &nbsp; JOESearch me. ( quickly ) I mean  --  I 'll see . He sticks his head out through the curtains . The girls heaped in the aisle are extricating themselves and scurrying back as fast as they can into their berths . Jerry scrambles up the ladder into Upper 7 , pulls the curtains , just as the curtains of Lower 1 are flung open and Sue emerges . She glances up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; SUE ( angrily ) What 's going on around here ? ( shouting ) BIENSTOCK ! Bienstock staggers sleepily out of Lower 2 . &nbsp; BIENSTOCKAre we in Florida ? At the entrance to the women 's lounge , Sugar has joined Joe and the two are peering through the curtains . The door of the car opens , and the conductor runs in angrily . The two withdraw back into the lounge . The conductor joins Sue and Bienstock . &nbsp; CONDUCTORAll right . Who pulled the emergency brake ? Who was it ? &nbsp; BIENSTOCK ( bellowing at the closed curtains ) Come on , girls . Who was it ? Through the curtains of Upper 7 , Jerry 's head appears timidly . &nbsp; JERRYI was it . &nbsp; SUEWhat 's the big idea ? &nbsp; JERRYI 'm sorry . I was having a nightmare . ( He hiccups )  --  62  --  Something I ate . I 'm not at all well . ( holds out cocktail shaker ) See ? Hot water bottle . &nbsp; CONDUCTOR ( disgustedly ) Musicians ! The last time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drunken brawl  --  twelve of them in one berth ! Jerry clucks his tongue disapprovingly . The conductor jerks the emergency cord a couple of times , signaling the engineer to start the train again . Joe appears from the women 's lounge , signals to Sugar , who is behind him . &nbsp; JOEOkay , Sugar  --  all clear . You better go back to bed . &nbsp; SUGARI might as well stay in there . I wo n't be able to sleep anyway . &nbsp; JOEWhy not ? &nbsp; SUGARBienstock . He snores to beat the band . We cut cards to see who sleeps over him , and I always lose . Would n't you know ? &nbsp; JOEWant to switch berths with me ? &nbsp; SUGARWould you mind terribly ? &nbsp; JOENot at all . He leads her to Lower 7 . The curtains of Upper 7 are closed . &nbsp; JOEI can fall asleep anywhere , any time , over anybody . He takes his suitcase out , stashes it under the berth . &nbsp; SUGARThanks , honey .  --  63  --  &nbsp; JOE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 , Jerry is lying on his back with his eyes wide open , listening intently . &nbsp; SUGAR 'S VOICEGood night , Josephine . Jerry props himself up on one elbow , a smug grin of anticipation on his face . Sugar gets into Lower 7 , closing the curtains . Joe proceeds down the aisle , mounts the ladder to Upper 2 . In Upper 2 , Joe closes the curtains , settles down to sleep . In the berth below , Bienstock is snoring away . Unable to take it , Joe clamps the spare pillow over his head . In Upper 7 , Jerry takes a long swig out of the hot water bottle to get his courage up . Then he parts the curtains cautiously , drops to the aisle . He leans toward the closed curtains of Lower 7 . &nbsp; JERRY ( very softly ) Joe  --  you asleep , Joe ? In Lower 7 , Sugar , her eyes closed , is drifting off to sleep . Jerry , satisfied that Joe is asleep , pussyfoots down the aisle to Berth 2 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the ladder to Upper 2 . In Upper 2 , Joe lies facing the window . The curtains part gingerly , and Jerry sticks his head in . &nbsp; JERRY ( a honeyed whisper ) Sugar  --  Sugar baby  --  Joe opens his eyes wide , and is about to turn around , but Jerry puts a restraining hand on his shoulder . &nbsp; JERRY ( continuing ) Sssh . Do n't move . It 's me  --  Daphne . We do n't want to wake up Bienstock . He slips into the berth , and the curtains close behind him . It 's pretty dark now . Jerry stretches out on top of the covers ,  --  64  --  addresses the back of Joe 's head . Joe , a grim expression on his face , is waiting to see how far Jerry will go . &nbsp; JERRY ( continuing ; the big moment ) You know what I promised you before ? That surprise ? Well , I better break it to you gently . In the first place , I 'm not a natural blonde  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things about me that are not natural . . . . You see , my friend and I  --  the reason we 're on the train with you girls  --  well , you know those holes in the bull-fiddle  --  that was n't mice  --  what I 'm trying to say is  --  my name is n't really Daphne  --  it 's Geraldine  --  I mean , Jerry  --  and you know why it 's Jerry ? Because I 'm a boy ! He sweeps his blonde wig off . Joe , who 's had enough , makes a move to sit up , but Jerry pushes him back gently . &nbsp; JERRY ( continuing ) Do n't scream , please . Do n't spoil it  --  it 's too beautiful . Just think of it , you and I  --  same berth , opposite sexes  --  male and female  --  he and she  --  the moth and the flame  --  ( takes Joe 's hand , puts it on his heart ) Feel my heart  --  like a crazy drum . ( starts kissing Joe 's hand ) I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are we going to do about it ? Joe has had it . Wheeling around , he grabs Jerry by the front of his nightgown , starts to shake him like a terrier shaking a rat . &nbsp; JERRY ( continuing , nonplussed ) Sugar , what are you doing ? Do n't get sore , baby  --  Beginning to realize something may be wrong , Jerry reaches up and switches on the light . There is something wrong . &nbsp; JOE ( holding Jerry with one hand , cocking the other ) Male and female  --  the moth and the flame  --  I ought to slug you ! &nbsp; JERRY ( slapping wig back on his head ) You would n't hit a girl , would you ? pp. 25-43 &nbsp; pp. 65-85 OUTSIDE THE SEMINOLE-RITZ HOTEL , THE NEXT MORNING The sprawling gingerbread structure basks in the warm Florida sun , fanned by towering palm trees , and lulled by waves breaking lazily on the exclusive beach frontage . Wintertime and the livin ' is easy , fish are jumpin ' and the market is high . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance , hauling the Society Syncopators from the station . The rear of the bus is loaded with luggage and instruments . On the hotel veranda , creaking in their rocking chairs , are a dozen elderly gentlemen . They are all in resort clothes  --  white flannels , striped flannels , knickers , Panama hats , white linen caps  --  and they are all reading the Wall Street Journal . Their combined age must be about a thousand years , and their combined bank balance just about as many millions . As they hear the bus drawing up , they stop rocking , and slowly lower their Wall Street Journals . They are all wearing sunglasses , and leaning forward , they peer through them at the new arrivals . In the driveway , the girls are climbing out of the bus , luggage and instruments are being unloaded . Jerry helps Sugar down , while Joe gets their instruments out of the pile . He hands the bull-fiddle case to Jerry , the ukulele case to Sugar . &nbsp; JERRY ( taking the ukulele from Sugar ) I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; JOE ( handing Jerry the saxophone case ) Thank you , Daphne . ( to Sugar ) Is n't she a sweetheart ? He leads her toward the entrance . Jerry , loaded down with bass fiddle , ukulele and sax , glares after them angrily , then follows them , balancing precariously on his high heels . On the veranda , the twelve rich dodos remove their sunglasses to get a better look at the girls . The one nearest to the steps is Osgood Fielding III .  --  66  --  He is a bit younger than the others , but that still puts him in his late fifties . He wears white plus-fours , argyle socks , two-toned shoes , and a gleam in his eye . He tips his Panama hat rakishly as the girl musicians mount the steps . Joe and Sugar come up the steps . Joe nudges her , directing her attention to the old crocks . &nbsp; JOEWell , there they are  --  more millionaires than you can shake a stick at . &nbsp; SUGARI 'll bet there is n't one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a century . Makes a girl think . &nbsp; SUGARYeah , I hope they brought their grandsons along . As they pass Osgood Fielding III and start into the lobby , he tips his Panama jauntily . Then he turns to inspect the next girl . The next girl is Jerry , struggling up the steps , loaded with bass fiddle , saxophone and ukulele . He trips on the top step , loses one of his shoes . Osgood jumps up gallantly . &nbsp; OSGOODJust a moment , Miss  --  ( picks up shoe ) May I ? &nbsp; JERRY ( extending his foot regally ) Help yourself . &nbsp; OSGOOD ( slipping shoe on ) I am Osgood Fielding the Third . &nbsp; JERRYI am Cinderella the Second . He starts to pull away , but Osgood holds on to his ankle . &nbsp; OSGOODIf there 's one thing I admire , it 's a girl with a shapely ankle . &nbsp; JERRYMe too . Bye now .  --  67  --  &nbsp; OSGOODLet me carry one of the instruments . &nbsp; JERRYThank you . ( loading him up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He starts into the lobby , Osgood struggling after him with the instruments . The lobby is very resort-y  --  potted palms , overhead fans , and a heavy undergrowth of wicker furniture . Osgood , balancing the instruments , follows Jerry in . &nbsp; OSGOODIt certainly is delightful to have some young blood around here . &nbsp; JERRYPersonally , I 'm Type O. &nbsp; OSGOODYou know , I 've always been fascinated by show business . &nbsp; JERRYYou do n't say . &nbsp; OSGOODYes , indeed . It 's cost my family quite a bit of money . &nbsp; JERRYYou invest in shows ? &nbsp; OSGOODNo  --  in showgirls . I 've been married seven or eight times  --  &nbsp; JERRYYou 're not sure ? &nbsp; OSGOODMama is keeping score . Frankly , she 's getting rather annoyed with me . &nbsp; JERRYI 'm not surprised . &nbsp; OSGOODSo this year , when George White 's Scandals opened , she packed me off to Florida . Right now she thinks I 'm out there on my yacht  --  deep-sea fishing .  --  68  --  &nbsp; JERRYWell , pull in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong fish . They come up to the elevator . The doors are just closing on a load of girl musicians going up . &nbsp; OSGOODIf I promise not to be a naughty boy . How about dinner tonight ? &nbsp; JERRYSorry . I 'll be on the bandstand . &nbsp; OSGOODOh , of course . Which of these instruments do you play ? &nbsp; JERRYBull fiddle . &nbsp; OSGOODFascinating . Do you use a bow or do you just pluck it ? &nbsp; JERRYMost of the time I slap it . &nbsp; OSGOODYou must be quite a girl . &nbsp; JERRYWanna bet ? &nbsp; OSGOODMy last wife was an acrobatic dancer  --  you know , sort of a contortionist . She could smoke a cigarette while holding it between her toes . Zowie ! But Mama broke it up . &nbsp; JERRYWhy ? &nbsp; OSGOODShe does n't approve of girls who smoke . The elevator has come down again , and the doors open . &nbsp; JERRY ( reaching for the instruments ) Good-bye , Mr. Fielding . &nbsp; OSGOODGood-bye ?  --  69  --  &nbsp; JERRYThis is where I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't get off that easy . He eases her into the elevator , follows with the instruments . &nbsp; OSGOOD ( continuing ; to elevator operator ) All right , driver . Once around the park . Slowly . And keep your eyes on the road . The door closes . The elevator moves smoothly past the second floor , then stops abruptly , jiggles violently , starts down again . The door opens . &nbsp; JERRY ( outraged womanhood ) What kind of girl do you think I am , Mr. Fielding ! He slaps Osgood 's face , takes the instruments from him . &nbsp; OSGOODPlease . It wo n't happen again . &nbsp; JERRYNo , thank you . I 'll walk . He stalks out of the elevator with the instruments , starts indignantly up the stairs . Osgood stands holding his cheek , looking after him enraptured . &nbsp; OSGOODZowie ! Section Details THE FOURTH FLOOR CORRIDOR This is the floor on which the girls are billeted . Sugar , Joe and the other Society Syncopators are gathered around Bienstock and Sue , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding up a list ) All right , girls , here are your room assignments .

As he continues to search , Sue takes the list from him , starts to read it off .  --  70  --  &nbsp; SUEOlga and Mary Lou in 412  --  and Mary Lou , keep your kimono buttoned when you ring for room service . Josephine and Daphne in 413 , Dolores and Sugar in 414  --  &nbsp; DOLORESMe and Sugar ? &nbsp; SUEWhat did you expect  --  a one-legged jockey ? Joe and Sugar are moving on toward their rooms . &nbsp; SUGARI wish they 'd put us in the same room . &nbsp; JOESo do I. But do n't worry  --  we 'll be seeing a lot of each other . They reach the door of 414 , and Sugar opens it . &nbsp; SUGAR ( ruefully ) 414  --  that 's the same room number I had in Cincinnati  --  my last time around with a male band . What a heel he was . &nbsp; JOESaxophone player ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Two in the morning , he sent me down for knackwurst and potato salad . They were out of potato salad , so I brought coleslaw  --  so he threw it right in my face . &nbsp; JOEForget it , Sugar , will you ? Forget saxophone players . You 're going to meet a millionaire  --  a young one . &nbsp; SUGARWhat makes you so sure ? &nbsp; JOEJust my feminine intuition . She smiles gratefully at him as she enters 414 . Joe crosses to the open door of 413 , goes in . It 's a small room , twin beds , more wicker , adjoining bathroom . Outside the French windows is a balcony , facing the ocean .  --  71  --  As Joe comes in , a bellhop is just setting down some suitcases .

After all , you work here  --  I work here  --  and believe you me , it 's nice to have you with the organization . &nbsp; JOEBye . &nbsp; BELLHOP ( the young Clark Gable ) Listen , doll  --  what time do you get off tonight ? &nbsp; JOEWhy ? &nbsp; BELLHOPBecause I 'm working the night shift  --  and I got a bottle of gin stashed away  --  and as soon as there 's a lull  --  &nbsp; JOEAre n't you a little too young for that , Sonny ? &nbsp; BELLHOPWanna see my driver 's license ? &nbsp; JOEGet lost , will you ? &nbsp; BELLHOPThat 's the way I like ' em  --  big and sassy .

Joe looks after him  --  72  --  grimly , then his eyes fall on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly under the bed . The door opens again , and Joe whirls around . Jerry comes staggering in breathlessly with the instruments , kicks the door shut with his foot . &nbsp; JERRYWhy , that dirty old man ! He throws the instruments disgustedly on one of the beds . &nbsp; JOEWhat happened ? &nbsp; JERRYI got pinched in the elevator . &nbsp; JOEWell , now you know how the other half lives . &nbsp; JERRY ( looking in the mirror ) And I 'm not even pretty . &nbsp; JOEThey do n't care  --  just as long as you wear skirts . It 's like waving a red flag in front of a bull . &nbsp; JERRYI 'm tired of being a flag . I want to be a bull again . Let 's get out of here , Joe . Let 's blow . &nbsp; JOEBlow where ? &nbsp; JERRYYou promised  --  the minute we hit Florida , we were going to beat it . &nbsp; JOEHow can we ? We 're broke . &nbsp; JERRYWe can get a job with another band . A male band . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chums are looking for us in every male band in the country . &nbsp; JERRYBut this is so humiliating .  --  73  --  &nbsp; JOESo you got pinched in the elevator . So what ? Would you rather be picking lead out of your navel ? &nbsp; JERRYAll right , all right ! ( rips off his hat and wig , tosses them on the bed ) But how long can we keep this up ? &nbsp; JOEWhat 's the beef ? We 're sitting pretty . We get room and board  --  we get paid every week  --  there 's the palm trees and the flying fish  --  &nbsp; JERRYWhat are you giving me with the flying fish ? I know why you want to stick around  --  you 're after Sugar . &nbsp; JOE ( holier-than-thou ) Me ? After Sugar ? &nbsp; JERRYI watched you two on the bus  --  lovey-dovey  --  whispering and giggling and borrowing each other 's lipstick  --  &nbsp; JOEWhat are you talking about ? Sugar and me , we 're just like sisters . &nbsp; JERRYYeah ? Well , I 'm your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . There is a knock on the door . &nbsp; BIENSTOCK 'S VOICEAre you decent ? Joe pulls Jerry 's wig out of the hat , jams it down on his head . &nbsp; JOECome in . Bienstock comes in . &nbsp; BIENSTOCKYou girls seen a brown bag with a white stripe and my initials ? &nbsp; JERRYA what ?  --  74  --  &nbsp; BIENSTOCKMy suitcase  --  with all my resort clothes . &nbsp; JOE ( glancing down ) No , we have n't . &nbsp; BIENSTOCKCa n't understand it . First my glasses disappear  --  then one of my suitcases  --  Sugar appears in the doorway behind him . &nbsp; SUGARWhere 's my ukulele ? &nbsp; BIENSTOCK --  now a ukulele . There must be a sneak thief around here . He goes out , shaking his head in puzzlement . &nbsp; JERRY ( handing her the ukulele ) Here you are , Sugar . &nbsp; SUGARA bunch of us girls are going for a swim . What to come along ? &nbsp; JERRYYou betcha . &nbsp; JOEWait a minute , Daphne . You have n't got a bathing suit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have one either . &nbsp; JERRY ( to Joe ) See ? She does n't have one either  --  ( to Sugar ) You do n't ? &nbsp; SUGARWe 'll rent some at the bathhouse . How about you , Josephine ? &nbsp; JOENo , thanks . I 'd rather stay in and soak in a hot tub . He steps into the bathroom , turns on the faucet.  --  75  --  &nbsp; JERRYYeah  --  let her soak . Come on . &nbsp; JOEDo n't get burned , Daphne . &nbsp; SUGAROh , I have some suntan lotion . &nbsp; JERRYShe 'll rub it on me  --  and I 'll rub it on her  --  and we 'll rub it on each other . . . . Bye . He ushers Sugar out in high spirits . Joe looks after them , then quickly locks the hall door , and stepping into the bathroom , turns off the water . He hurries over to the bed , slides out Bienstock 's suitcase , opens it . It 's crammed full of resort clothes . Joe takes out a blazer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perches on his head . Then he lifts his skirt above his knee , pulls out Bienstock 's glasses from under his garter . He puts them on , peers around myopically . His enlarged eyes are grotesque  --  but then again , so is his scheme . Section Details AT THE BEACH To the accompaniment of " By the Beautiful Sea , " several girls from the band , in bathing suits and caps , are running into the surf . The other girls are already in the water , splashing around and frolicking like a school of playful porpoises . There is no sign of Jerry . Sugar , standing up to her waist in water , suddenly lets out a startled squeal , slaps the surface of the water behind her . &nbsp; SUGARDaphne ! Cut that out ! Jerry comes diving up , spouting water like a dolphin . He is wearing a girl 's knitted bathing suit with a short skirt , and a rubber cap . &nbsp; SUGAR ( continuing ) What do you think you 're doing ? &nbsp; JERRYJust a little trick I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling in.  --  76  --  &nbsp; JERRY ( continuing ) Oooh . Here comes a big one . He grabs Sugar , holding on to her tightly . The wave breaks over them , sweeps them off their feet . Strolling casually along the beach is Joe . He is wearing Bienstock 's blazer ( crest and eight gold buttons ) , flannel slacks ( bell-bottom ) , a silk scarf , a yachting cap , and the glasses ( which blur his vision considerably ) . In his hand he carries a rolled-up copy of the Wall Street Journal . He looks off toward the ocean . The girls are scampering out of the water , and some of them start to toss a beach ball around . Sugar and Jerry come running up to the beach hand in hand . They take their caps off , and Sugar puts on a short terry-cloth jacket . Jerry jumps around on one foot , his head tilted , shaking the water out of his ear , then starts to rub himself off with a towel . &nbsp; SUGAR ( studying him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were such a big girl . &nbsp; JERRYYou should have seen me before I went on a diet . &nbsp; SUGARI mean , your shoulders  --  and your arms  --  &nbsp; JERRYThat 's from carrying around the bull fiddle . &nbsp; SUGARBut there 's one thing I envy you for . &nbsp; JERRYWhat 's that ? &nbsp; SUGARYou 're so flat-chested . Clothes hang so much better on you than they do on me . &nbsp; DOLORES ' VOICE ( from off ) Look out , Daphne ! A beach ball comes sailing by and Jerry catches it .  --  77  --  &nbsp; JERRYCome on , Sugar  --  let 's play . He takes Sugar 's hand , skips off with her to join the other girls . Joe , meanwhile , has come up to a basket chair near by . Sitting in front of it , sorting sea shells out of a small pail , is a boy of five . A few feet away stands his mother , calling him . &nbsp; MOTHERLet 's go , Junior . Time for your nap . &nbsp; JOENah . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner of his mouth ) You heard your mudder , Junior . Scram . The boy looks up at him , fearfully . &nbsp; JOE ( continuing ) This beach ai n't big enough for both of us . The boy scrambles to his feet , and screaming " Mommy , " runs off , leaving the pailful of shells behind . Joe settles himself in the chair , peers over his shoulder toward the girls playing ball . The girls , Sugar and Jerry among them , are standing in a wide circle , tossing the beach ball around and chanting rhythmically : " I love coffee , I love tea , how many boys are struck on me ? One , two , three , four , five  --  " There is a wild throw over Sugar 's head , in the direction of Joe 's chair . Sugar turns and runs after the ball to retrieve it . This is exactly what Joe has been waiting for . As the ball comes rolling past , he unfolds the Wall Street Journal , pretends to be reading it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of inches  --  enough to trip her and send her sprawling to the sand . &nbsp; JOE ( lowering paper ; Cary Grant by now ) Oh , I 'm terribly sorry . &nbsp; SUGARMy fault .  --  78  --  &nbsp; JOE ( helping her up ) You 're not hurt , are you ? &nbsp; SUGARI do n't think so . &nbsp; JOEI wish you 'd make sure . &nbsp; SUGARWhy ? &nbsp; JOEBecause usually , when people find out who I am , they get themselves a wheel chair and a shyster lawyer , and sue me for a quarter of a million dollars . &nbsp; SUGARWell , do n't worry . I wo n't sue you  --  no matter who you are . &nbsp; JOE ( returning to chair ) Thank you . &nbsp; SUGARWho are you ? &nbsp; JOENow , really  --  Jerry and the other girls are looking off toward Sugar , waiting for the ball . &nbsp; JERRYHey , Sugar  --  come on . Sugar picks up the ball . &nbsp; JOE ( blas ) So long . He buries himself behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then throws the ball back to the girls . She steps closer to Joe , peers around the paper , studying him . &nbsp; SUGARHave n't I seen you somewhere before ? &nbsp; JOE ( without looking up ) Not very likely .  --  79  --  &nbsp; SUGARAre you staying at the hotel ? &nbsp; JOENot at all . &nbsp; SUGARYour face is familiar . &nbsp; JOEPossible you saw it in a newspaper  --  or magazine  - -  Vanity Fair  --  &nbsp; SUGARThat must be it . &nbsp; JOE ( waving her aside ) Would you mind moving just a little ? You 're blocking my view . &nbsp; SUGARYour view of what ? &nbsp; JOEThey run up a red-and-white flag on the yacht when it 's time for cocktails . &nbsp; SUGAR ( snapping at the bait ) You have a yacht ? She turns and looks seaward at half a dozen yachts of different sizes bobbing in the distance . &nbsp; SUGAR ( continuing ) Which one is yours ? The big one ? &nbsp; JOECertainly not . With all that unrest in the world , I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; SUGARI quite agree . Tell me , who runs up that flag  --  your wife ? &nbsp; JOENo , my flag steward . &nbsp; SUGARAnd who mixes the cocktails  --  your wife ?  --  80  --  &nbsp; JOENo , my cocktail steward . Look , if you 're interested in whether I 'm married or not  --  &nbsp; SUGARI 'm not interested at all . &nbsp; JOEWell , I 'm not . &nbsp; SUGARThat 's very interesting . Joe resumes reading the paper . Sugar sits on the sand beside his chair . &nbsp; SUGAR ( continuing ) How 's the stock market ? &nbsp; JOE ( lackadaisically ) Up , up , up . &nbsp; SUGARI 'll bet just while we were talking , you made like a hundred thousand dollars . &nbsp; JOECould be . Do you play the market ? &nbsp; SUGARNo  --  the ukulele . And I sing . &nbsp; JOEFor your own amusement ? &nbsp; SUGARWell  --  a group of us are appearing at the hotel . Sweet Sue and Her Society Syncopators . &nbsp; JOEYou 're society girls ? &nbsp; SUGAROh , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  we 're only doing this for a lark . &nbsp; JOESyncopators  --  does that mean you play that fast music  --  jazz ?  --  81  --  &nbsp; SUGARYeah . Real hot . &nbsp; JOEOh . Well , I guess some like it hot . But personally , I prefer classical music . &nbsp; SUGARSo do I. As a matter of fact , I spent three years at the Sheboygan Conservatory of Music . &nbsp; JOEGood school ! And your family does n't object to your career ? &nbsp; SUGARThey do indeed . Daddy threatened to cut me off without a cent , but I do n't care . It was such a bore . Coming-out parties , cotillions  --  &nbsp; JOEInauguration balls  --  &nbsp; SUGAROpening of the Opera  --  &nbsp; JOERiding to hounds  --  &nbsp; SUGARAnd always the same Four Hundred . &nbsp; JOEYou know , it 's amazing we never ran into each other before . I 'm sure I would have remembered anybody as attractive as you . &nbsp; SUGARYou 're very kind . I 'll bet you 're also very gentle  --  and helpless  --  &nbsp; JOEI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this theory about men with glasses . &nbsp; JOEWhat theory ? &nbsp; SUGARMaybe I 'll tell you when I know you a little better . What are you doing tonight ?  --  82  --  &nbsp; JOETonight ? &nbsp; SUGARI thought you might like to come to the hotel and hear us play . &nbsp; JOEI 'd like to  --  but it may be rather difficult . &nbsp; SUGARWhy ? &nbsp; JOE ( his eyes on the pail with the shells ) I only come ashore twice a day  --  when the tide goes out . &nbsp; SUGAROh ? &nbsp; JOEIt 's on account of the shells . That 's my hobby . &nbsp; SUGARYou collect shells ? &nbsp; JOE ( taking a handful of shells from the pail ) Yes . So did my father and my grandfather . We 've all had this passion for shells  --  that 's why we named the oil company after it . &nbsp; SUGAR ( wide-eyed ) Shell Oil ? &nbsp; JOEPlease  --  no names . Just call me Junior . By this time , the ball game is breaking up , and Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  time to change for dinner . &nbsp; SUGARRun along , Daphne  --  I 'll catch up with you . &nbsp; JERRY ( a casual glance at Joe ) Okay . He takes a couple of steps away from them , freezes , comes back and stares at Joe open-mouthed.  --  83  --  &nbsp; JOEWhat is it , young lady ? What are you staring at ? &nbsp; JERRY ( points ; speechless ) You  --  you  --  &nbsp; JOE ( to Sugar ) This happens to me all the time in public . &nbsp; SUGAR ( to Jerry ) I recognized him too  --  his picture was in Vanity Fair . &nbsp; JERRYVanity Fair ? &nbsp; JOE ( waving him aside ) Would you mind moving along , please ? &nbsp; SUGARYes , you 're in the way . He 's waiting for a signal from his yacht . &nbsp; JERRYHis yacht ? &nbsp; SUGARIt sleeps twelve . ( to Joe ) This is my friend Daphne . She 's a Vassar girl . &nbsp; JERRYI 'm a what ? &nbsp; SUGAROr was it Bryn Mawr ? &nbsp; JOE ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl who went to Bryn Mawr . She squealed on her roommate , and they found her strangled with her own brassiere . &nbsp; JERRY ( grimly ) Yes  --  you have to be very careful about picking a roommate .  --  84  --  &nbsp; SUGARWell , I guess I 'd better go  --  &nbsp; JOEIt 's been delightful meeting you both . &nbsp; SUGARAnd you will come to hear us tonight ? &nbsp; JOEIf it 's at all possible  --  &nbsp; JERRYOh , please do come . Do n't disappoint us . It 'll be such fun . And bring your yacht . &nbsp; SUGARCome on , Daphne . She leads Jerry away . Joe throws them a casual salute . As Jerry and Sugar move off , Jerry looks over his shoulder . &nbsp; JERRYWell , I 'll be ! How about that guy ? &nbsp; SUGARNow look , Daphne , hands off . I saw him first . &nbsp; JERRYSugar , dear  --  let me give you some advice . If I were a girl  --  and I am  --  I 'd watch my step . &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have met him . Wait till I tell Josephine . &nbsp; JERRYYeah  --  Josephine . &nbsp; SUGARWill she be surprised . I just ca n't wait to see her face  --  &nbsp; JERRYNeither can I. Come on , let 's go up to her room and tell her  - -  right now . He grabs her hand , starts to run toward the hotel . &nbsp; SUGARWe do n't have to run .  --  85  --  &nbsp; JERRYOh yes , we do ! pp. 44-64 &nbsp; pp. 86-107 THE FOURTH FLOOR Jerry , holding Sugar by the hand , comes running down the corridor from the elevator . He flings open the door of 413 , pulls Sugar inside . Jerry and Sugar stop breathlessly , look around . The room is empty . &nbsp; JERRYJosephine ? &nbsp; SUGARI guess she 's not here . &nbsp; JERRYThat 's funny . Josie  --  ( sees Josephine 's dress on a hanger ; smugly ) I ca n't imagine where she can be . &nbsp; SUGARWell , I 'll come back later . &nbsp; JERRYNo , no , Sugar  --  wait . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; SUGAR ( sitting down ) Believe it or not  --  Josephine predicted the whole thing . &nbsp; JERRYYeah . This is one for Ripley . &nbsp; SUGARDo you suppose she went out shopping ? &nbsp; JERRYThat 's it . Something tells me she 's going to walk through that door in a whole new outfit . He opens the door , peers out into the corridor expecting Joe to show up in the yachting outfit . At the same time , through the partly open door of the bathroom , comes Josephine 's voice , singing " Running Wild . " Jerry does a double-take . Sugar starts toward the bathroom door and opens it . Jerry follows her , incredulously .  --  86  --  In the bathroom , with his wig on , Joe is lying languidly in the tub taking a bubble-bath , up to his neck in white foam . &nbsp; SUGARJosephine . &nbsp; JOEOh , I did n't hear you come in . Jerry looks back toward the windows , trying to figure out how Joe got in . &nbsp; SUGARThe most wonderful thing happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prohibition ? &nbsp; JERRYOh , come on  --  you can do better than that . &nbsp; SUGARI met one of them . &nbsp; JOEOne of whom ? &nbsp; SUGARShell Oil , Junior . He 's got millions  --  he 's got glasses  --  and he 's got a yacht . &nbsp; JOE ( beaming ) You do n't say ! &nbsp; JERRYHe 's not only got a yacht , he 's got a bicycle . &nbsp; JOE ( warningly ) Daphne  --  ( to Sugar ) Go on  --  tell me all about him . &nbsp; SUGARWell , he 's young and handsome and a bachelor . And he 's a real gentleman  --  not one of these grabbers.  --  87  --  &nbsp; JOEMaybe you 'd better go after him  --  if you do n't want to lose him . &nbsp; SUGAROh , I 'm not going to let this one get away . He 's so cute  --  collects shells . &nbsp; JOEShells ? Whatever for ? &nbsp; JERRYYou know  --  the old shell game . &nbsp; JOEDaphne , you 're bothering us . &nbsp; SUGARAnyway , you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUGARBecause he said he 's coming to hear us play  --  maybe . &nbsp; JERRYWhat do you mean , maybe ? I saw the way he looked at you . He 'll be there for sure . &nbsp; SUGARI hope so . &nbsp; JERRYWhat do you think , Josephine ? What does it say in your crystal ball ? Joe glares at him . Meanwhile , Dolores has come into the room in her wet bathing suit and carrying a dripping rubber horse . She sticks her head into the bathroom . &nbsp; DOLORESHey , Sugar , you got the key ? I 'm locked out and I 'm making a puddle in the hall . &nbsp; SUGAR ( to Joe and Jerry ) See you on the bandstand , girls . She follows Dolores out , closing the door . Joe and Jerry are alone now . The atmosphere is tense . They look at each other steely-eyed.  --  88  --  &nbsp; JOE ( finally ) Wise guy , huh ? Trying to louse me up  --  &nbsp; JERRYAnd what are you trying to do to poor Sugar ? Putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( a la Cary Grant ) Nobody talks like that ! I 've seen you pull some low tricks on dames  --  but this is the trickiest and the lowest and the meanest  --  His words trail off as he sees Joe rise slowly out of the tub . The mystery of his quick change is now solved  --  he did n't change at all . He is fully dressed in Bienstock 's outfit , and is clutching the yachting cap . As he emerges from the bathtub , covered with suds , he looks like some diabolical monster . He advances on Jerry menacingly . &nbsp; JERRY ( continuing ) I 'm not scared of you  --  ( retreating ) I may be small , but I 'm wiry  --  ( retreating some more ) When I 'm aroused , I 'm a tiger ! By this time he is up against the wall . Joe is closing in on him . &nbsp; JERRY ( continuing ; conciliatory ) Do n't look at me like that , Joe  --  I did n't mean any harm  --  it was just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suit myself . The phone rings . &nbsp; JERRY ( continuing ) Telephone  --  Joe closes in relentlessly . &nbsp; JERRY ( continuing ) You better answer the phone  --  Joe slams the sopping cap on Jerry 's head . As Jerry coughs and splutters , Joe picks up the ringing phone .  --  89  --  &nbsp; JOEHello. ( remembering he is a girl , pitches voice higher ) Hello . Yes , this is 413  --  ship-to-shore ? All right , I 'll take it . The yacht Caledonia is a chic vessel indeed  --  and so is Osgood Fielding III , lounging in a deck chair , speaking into a radio-telephone . &nbsp; OSGOOD ( that gleam in his eye ) Hello , Daphne ? It 's that naughty boy again  --  you know , Osgood  --  in the elevator  --  you slapped my face ? Who is this ? Joe is on the phone . Through the open door of the bathroom we see Jerry wiping his face . &nbsp; JOEThis is her roommate . Daphne ca n't talk right now . Is it anything urgent ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give her a message ? I 'd like her to have a little supper with me on my yacht after the show tonight . &nbsp; JOEGot it . Supper  --  yacht  --  after the show  --  I 'll tell her .

This is going to be a quiet little midnight snack  --  just the two of us . &nbsp; JOEJust the two of you ? What about the crew ? &nbsp; OSGOODOh , that 's all taken care of . I 'm giving them shore leave . We 'll have a little cold pheasant and champagne . And I checked with the Coast Guard  --  there 'll be a full moon tonight . Oh , and tell her I got a new batch of Rudy Vallee records .  --  90  --  &nbsp; JOE ( into phone ) That 's good thinking . Daphne 's a push-over for him . Jerry comes up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whom ? What is it ? Who 's on the phone ? &nbsp; JOE ( shushing him ; into phone ) Yes , Mr. Fielding . You 'll pick her up after the show in your motorboat . Good-bye  --  what 's that you said ? Oh  --  zowie ! I 'll give her the message . ( He hangs up ) &nbsp; JERRYWhat message ? What motorboat ? &nbsp; JOEYou got it made , kid . Fielding wants you to have a little cold pheasant with him on his yacht  --  &nbsp; JERRYOh , he does ! &nbsp; JOEJust the three of you on that great big boat  --  you and him and Rudy Vallee . &nbsp; JERRYFat chance ! You call him right back and tell him I 'm not going . &nbsp; JOEOf course , you 're not . I 'm going . &nbsp; JERRYYou 're going to be on the boat with that dirty old man ? &nbsp; JOENo . I 'm going to be on the boat with Sugar . &nbsp; JERRYAnd where 's he going to be ? &nbsp; JOEHe 's going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right .  --  91  --  &nbsp; JERRYOh , no ! Not tonight , Josephine ! Section Details THE HOTEL BALLROOM It 's a good-sized nightclub of the period , with about two hundred guests in formal dress at the tables and on the dance floor . A revolving globe , with a mirrored surface , throws patterns of light and shadow on the dancers . On the bandstand , Sugar , backed by the rest of the orchestra , is singing . The girls in the band , Joe and Jerry among them , wear uniform evening gowns and long earrings . Sugar and Sue wear distinctive gowns . Sugar 's song is " I Want To Be Loved by You , " which she belts across in the style of the twenties , complete with poop-poop-pa-doop trimmings . As she sings , she scans the room for her bespectacled Prince Charming , but there is no sign of him  --  naturally , since he is playing the saxophone behind her . In back of Joe is Jerry , thumping the bass grimly . He looks off , sees Osgood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone at a table . Catching Jerry 's eye , Osgood waves exuberantly , his face beaming with amorous anticipation . On the bandstand , Jerry looks away haughtily . &nbsp; JOE ( over his shoulder ) Daphne  --  your boy friend is waving at you . &nbsp; JERRYYou can both go take a flying jump . &nbsp; JOERemember  --  he 's your date for tonight . So smile . Jerry smiles feebly . &nbsp; JOE ( continuing ) Come on , you can do better than that . Give him the teeth  --  the whole personality . &nbsp; JERRY ( a frozen smile on his face ) Why do I let you talk me into these things ? Why ?  --  92  --  &nbsp; JOEBecause we 're pals  --  buddies  --  the two musketeers . &nbsp; JERRYDo n't give me the musketeers ! How 'm I going to keep the guy ashore ? &nbsp; JOETell him you get seasick on a yacht . Play miniature golf with him . &nbsp; JERRYOh , no .

( He breaks off one flower , hands it to Joe ) This is from me to you , doll . &nbsp; JOEBeat it , Buster . &nbsp; BELLHOP ( confidentially ) Never mind leaving your door open . I got a passkey . He winks and moves off . Joe looks after him contemptuously , then turns to Jerry , picks up the basket of flowers . &nbsp; JERRYWhat are you doing with my flowers ? &nbsp; JOEI 'm just borrowing them . You 'll get them back tomorrow . He hands Jerry the single flower , then looks around , fishes a small envelope out of his decolletage , slips it into the basket .  --  93  --  Sugar finishes her number , returns to her seat next to Joe . Sue leads the orchestra into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( to Joe ) I guess he 's not going to show up . It 's five minutes to one .

( she opens the note ) It 's Shell Oil . &nbsp; JERRY ( sarcastically ) No ! &nbsp; SUGARYes . He wants me to have supper with him  --  on his yacht . He 's going to pick me up at the pier . &nbsp; JERRYNo ! &nbsp; SUGARYes . &nbsp; JOE ( to Jerry ) You heard her yes . &nbsp; SUGAR ( bubbling over ) Oh , Josephine  --  just imagine  --  me , Sugar Kowalczyk , from Sandusky , Ohio , on a millionaire 's yacht . If my mother could only see me now . . . &nbsp; JERRY ( looking off toward Osgood ) I hope my mother never finds out . At his table Osgood , catching Jerry 's look , blows kisses to him . On the bandstand , Sue turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 94  --  &nbsp; SUEThat 's it for tonight , folks . This is Sweet Sue , saying good night , and reminding all you daddies out there , that every girl in my band is a virtuoso  --  and I intend to keep it that way ! Behind her , Sugar picks up her ukulele and the basket of flowers , tiptoes off the stand . Joe waves after her , wishing her luck . Sugar hurries toward the staircase , passing Bienstock , who is planted near the reservation desk . Joe frantically packs up his saxophone . Then he leaps off the bandstand , and dashing past the bewildered Bienstock , starts up the stairs two at a time . Section Details Interior Joe barges into his room , drops the saxophone case , locks the door . Then he darts into the bathroom , wriggling out of his dress . The dress and shoes come flying out . They are immediately followed by Joe , now partially dressed as a man . He slips into Bienstock 's coat , puts on the yachting cap . Even to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing  --  in his haste , he has neglected to take off his earrings . He opens a window , steps out onto the balcony . Joe moves along the balcony , climbs over the railing , starts to shinny down a post . While Joe is climbing down , Sugar , a fur boa over the evening gown she wore on the bandstand , comes tripping down the steps , hurries eagerly toward the beach . To one side of the main entrance , a dozen bicycles are parked in a rack . Joe drops down into the scene , sees the bicycles , pulls one out , mounts it , and pedals off . Standing under a tree in front of the hotel are Osgood and Jerry . Jerry is in his evening gown and is holding the flower in his hand . &nbsp; OSGOODBut it 's such a waste  --  a full moon  --  an empty yacht  --  &nbsp; JERRYI 'll throw up ! &nbsp; OSGOODWell , then , why do n't we go dancing ?

Why do n't we go there  --  blindfold the orchestra  --  and tango till dawn ? &nbsp; JERRYYou know something , Mr. Fielding ? You 're dynamite ! &nbsp; OSGOODYou 're a pretty hot little firecracker yourself . He links his arm through Jerry 's , leads him down the path . Sugar is now almost running toward the pier , a look of great expectation on her face . This is the big night of her life . Joe is pedaling desperately to get to the pier before her , oblivious of the earrings dangling incongruously from his ear lobes . About a dozen motorboats are tied up to the pier . Sugar hurries across the planking and up the stairs to the deserted pier , stops and looks around for her date . Behind her , Joe comes skimming along the planking on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks that she has been stood up . Joe dismounts from the bike , ducks underneath the pier , and hops into the motorboat marked Caledonia . Straightening up , he waves to Sugar on the pier above him . &nbsp; JOEAhoy there ! Sugar turns , her face lighting up .  --  96  --  &nbsp; SUGARAhoy ! She hurries down the steps toward him . Joe suddenly remembers his glasses . He takes them out of his pocket , puts them on . As he does so , he feels the earrings . He pulls them off , shoves them in his pocket  --  and not a second too soon , for Sugar has just about reached him . &nbsp; SUGAR ( continuing ) Been waiting long ? &nbsp; JOE ( Cary Grant again ) It 's not how long you wait  --  it 's who you 're waiting for . He helps her down into the motorboat . &nbsp; SUGARThank you . And thank you for the flowers . &nbsp; JOEI wanted them to fly down some orchids from our greenhouse but all of Long Island is fogged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settles herself back on the cushioned seat . Joe starts fiddling around with the mysterious knobs on the instrument panel . He pushes , pulls , twists the knob . Finally the motor turns over , but does not catch . &nbsp; JOEI seem to be out of gas . &nbsp; SUGARIt 's sort of funny , you being out of gas . I mean , Shell Oil and everything  --  Joe , working the knobs desperately , does something right , and the motor starts with a roar . &nbsp; JOEHere we go . He presses every lever he can find , manages to shift into gear . The boat backs out erratically . Joe shifts into neutral , but no matter how hard he tries to find the forward gear , he keeps winding up in reverse .  --  97  --  &nbsp; JOE ( apologetically ) I just got this motorboat  --  it 's an experimental model . &nbsp; SUGARLooks like they 're on the wrong track . &nbsp; JOEDo you mind riding backwards ? It may take a little longer . . . &nbsp; SUGARIt 's not how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The motorboat glides off backwards , and as though it were the most natural thing in the world , skims out toward the open water , where the yachts are anchored . The Caledonia is bobbing gently on a calm , moonlit sea . The motorboat with Joe and Sugar comes in stern-backwards . Joe , looking over his shoulder , maneuvers the motorboat to a stop under the landing ladder . Joe helps Sugar aboard . She gazes around , starry-eyed . &nbsp; SUGARIt looked so small from the beach  --  but when you 're on it , it 's more like a cruiser  --  or a destroyer . &nbsp; JOEJust regulation size . We have three like this . &nbsp; SUGARThree ? &nbsp; JOEMother keeps hers in Southampton  --  and Dad took his to Venezuela  --  the company is laying a new pipe line . &nbsp; SUGARMy dad is more interested in railroads . Baltimore and Ohio . Which is the port and which is the starboard ? &nbsp; JOE ( the old mariner ) Well , that depends  --  on whether you 're coming or going . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the stern  --  and that 's the bridge  --  so you can get from one side of the boat to the other . . . How about a glass of champagne ?  --  98  --  &nbsp; SUGARLove it . Which way ? &nbsp; JOEYes  --  now let 's see  --  where do you suppose the steward set it up ? He looks around , confused by the unfamiliar geography , then tentatively opens the nearest door , revealing a flight of stairs leading below deck . &nbsp; SUGAROh , you have an upstairs and a downstairs . &nbsp; JOEYes  --  that 's our hurricane cellar . He closes the door , opens another one  --  it 's a storage bin , containing mops , pails , coils of rope , etc . &nbsp; JOE ( continues ) And another nice thing about this yacht  --  lots of closet space . Sugar , meanwhile , has stepped up to a lighted porthole , looks inside . &nbsp; SUGAROh  --  in here . &nbsp; JOEOf course . On Thursdays , they always serve me in the small salon . He opens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very elegant layout  --  mahogany paneling , shelves of trophies , a stuffed marlin on the wall , a luxurious couch with a table for two set up beside it . On the table are lit candles , cold pheasant under glass , and champagne in a silver ice bucket . Joe and Sugar come in , and as Joe takes his cap off , Sugar looks around , dazzled . &nbsp; SUGARIt 's exquisite  --  like a floating mansion . &nbsp; JOEIt 's all right for a bachelor.  --  99  --  &nbsp; SUGAR ( stopping by the stuffed marlin ) What a beautiful fish . &nbsp; JOECaught him off Cape Hatteras . &nbsp; SUGARWhat is it ? &nbsp; JOEOh  --  a member of the herring family . &nbsp; SUGARA herring ? Is n't it amazing how they get those big fish into those little glass jars ? &nbsp; JOEThey shrink when they 're marinated . During this , he has opened the champagne , filled a couple of glasses . &nbsp; JOE ( continues ) Champagne ? &nbsp; SUGARI do n't mind if I do . &nbsp; JOE ( toasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . &nbsp; SUGARBon voyage . As she sips the drink , she glances at the shelves of trophies . &nbsp; SUGARLook at all that silverware . &nbsp; JOETrophies . You know  --  skeet-shooting , dog-breeding , water polo . . . &nbsp; SUGARWater polo  --  is n't that terribly dangerous ? &nbsp; JOEI 'll say . I had two ponies drowned under me.  --  100  --  &nbsp; SUGARWhere 's your shell collection ? &nbsp; JOEYes , of course . Now where could they have put it ? ( looking under the couch ) On Thursdays , I 'm sort of lost around here . &nbsp; SUGARWhat 's on Thursdays ? &nbsp; JOEIt 's the crew 's night off . &nbsp; SUGARYou mean we 're alone on the boat ? &nbsp; JOECompletely . &nbsp; SUGARYou know , I 've never been completely alone with a man before  --  in the middle of the night  --  in the middle of the ocean . &nbsp; JOEOh , it 's perfectly safe . We 're well-anchored  --  the ship is in shipshape shape  --  and the Coast Guard promised to call me if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icebergs . But there are certain men who would try to take advantage of a situation like this . &nbsp; JOEYou 're flattering me . &nbsp; SUGARWell , of course , I 'm sure you 're a gentleman . &nbsp; JOEOh , it 's not that . It 's just that I 'm  --  harmless . &nbsp; SUGARHarmless ? How ? &nbsp; JOEWell , I do n't know how to put it . But I have this thing about girls . &nbsp; SUGARWhat thing ?  --  101  --  &nbsp; JOEThey just sort of leave me cold . &nbsp; SUGARYou mean  --  like frigid ? &nbsp; JOEIt 's more like a mental block . When I 'm with a girl , it does nothing to me . &nbsp; SUGARHave you tried ? &nbsp; JOEHave I ? I 'm trying all the time . He casually puts his arms around her , kisses her on the lips , lets go of her again . &nbsp; JOESee ? Nothing . &nbsp; SUGARNothing at all ? &nbsp; JOEComplete washout . &nbsp; SUGARThat makes me feel just awful . &nbsp; JOEOh , it 's not your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother Nature throws somebody a dirty curve . Something goes wrong inside . &nbsp; SUGARYou mean you ca n't fall in love ? &nbsp; JOENot any more . I was in love once , but I 'd rather not talk about it . ( takes the glass bell off the cold cuts ) How about a little cold pheasant ? &nbsp; SUGARWhat happened ? &nbsp; JOEI do n't want to bore you . &nbsp; SUGAROh , you could n't possibly .  --  102  --  &nbsp; JOEWell , it was in my freshman year at Princeton . There was this girl , her name was Nellie , her father was vice-president of Hupmobile . She wore glasses , too . That summer we spent our vacation at the Grand Canyon . We were standing on the highest ledge , watching the sunset . Suddenly we had an impulse to kiss . I took off my glasses  --  she took off her glasses  --  I took a step toward her  --  she took a step toward me  --  &nbsp; SUGAR ( hand flying to mouth ) Oh , no ! &nbsp; JOEYes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I gave her three transfusions ( we had the same blood type  --  type O  --  ) it was too late . &nbsp; SUGARTalk about sad . &nbsp; JOEEver since then  --  ( indicating heart ) numb  --  no feelings . Like my heart was shot full of novocain . &nbsp; SUGARYou poor , poor boy . &nbsp; JOEYes  --  all the money in the world  --  but what good is it ? ( holding out serving plate ) Mint sauce or cranberries ? &nbsp; SUGARHow can you think about food at a time like this ? &nbsp; JOEWhat else is there for me ? ( tears off leg of pheasant ) &nbsp; SUGARIs it that hopeless ? &nbsp; JOE ( eating ) My family did everything they could . Hired the most beautiful French upstairs maids . Got a special tutor to read me  --  103  --  all the books that were banned in Boston . Imported a whole troupe of Balinese dancers with bells on their ankles and those long fingernails . . . What a waste of money ! &nbsp; SUGARHave you ever tried American girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but nothing spectacular . &nbsp; SUGARIs that anything ? &nbsp; JOE ( shaking his head ) Thanks just the same . He resumes nibbling on the pheasant leg , sits on the couch . &nbsp; SUGARMaybe if you saw a good doctor . . . &nbsp; JOEI have . Spent six months in Vienna with Professor Freud  --  flat on my back  --  ( stretches out on the couch , still eating ) then there were the Mayo brothers , and injections and hypnosis and mineral baths . If I were n't such a coward , I 'd kill myself . &nbsp; SUGARDo n't talk like that . I 'm sure there must be some girl some place that could  --  &nbsp; JOEIf I ever found a girl that could  --  I 'd marry her like that . He snaps his fingers . The word " marriage " makes something snap inside Sugar , too . &nbsp; SUGARWould you do me a favor ? &nbsp; JOEWhat is it ? &nbsp; SUGARI may not be Dr. Freud or a Mayo brother or one of those French upstairs girls . But could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; JOE ( blas ) All right  --  if you insist . She bends over him , gives him a kiss of slightly higher voltage . &nbsp; SUGARAnything this time ? &nbsp; JOEI 'm afraid not . Terribly sorry . &nbsp; SUGAR ( undaunted ) Would you like a little more champagne ? ( proceeds to refill glasses ) And maybe if we had some music  --  ( indicating lights ) how do you dim these lights ? &nbsp; JOELook , it 's terribly sweet of you to want to help out  --  but it 's no use . ( pointing ) I think the light switch is over there  --  ( Sugar dims lights ) and that 's the radio . ( Sugar switches it on ) It 's like taking somebody to a concert when he 's tone deaf . By this time there is only candlelight in the salon , and from the radio comes soft music , " Stairway to the Stars . " Sugar crosses to the couch with two champagne glasses , hands one to Joe , sits beside him . Joe drinks down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He drains that , too . &nbsp; SUGARYou 're not giving yourself a chance . Do n't fight it . Relax . ( She kisses him again ) &nbsp; JOE ( shaking his head ) It 's like smoking without inhaling . &nbsp; SUGARSo inhale ! This kiss is the real McCoy . They stay locked in each other 's arms . . .  --  105  --  AT A ROADHOUSE It is small , dark , and practically deserted . The Cuban band is playing " La Cumparsita . " Among the dancers on the floor are Osgood and Jerry , easily the most stylish couple in the joint . Jerry has the flower tucked in his cleavage . As they tango . . . &nbsp; OSGOODDaphne . . . &nbsp; JERRYYes , Osgood ? &nbsp; OSGOODYou 're leading again . &nbsp; JERRYSorry . They tango on . On the yacht , Joe and Sugar are still in the same embrace . The radio music continues . Finally they break . &nbsp; SUGAR ( waiting for the verdict ) Well  --  ? &nbsp; JOEI 'm not quite sure . Try it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at him  --  the suspense is unbearable . &nbsp; JOE ( trying to diagnose it ) I got a funny sensation in my toes  --  like somebody was barbecuing them over a slow flame . &nbsp; SUGARLet 's throw another log on the fire . Another kiss . &nbsp; JOEI think you 're on the right track . &nbsp; SUGARI must be  --  because your glasses are beginning to steam up . She kisses him again . Joe removes his glasses , which are now completely fogged up .  --  106  --  &nbsp; JOEI never knew it could be like this . &nbsp; SUGARThank you . &nbsp; JOEThey told me I was kaput  --  finished  --  washed up  --  and now you 're making a chump out of all those experts . &nbsp; SUGARMineral baths  --  now really ! &nbsp; JOEWhere did you learn to kiss like that ? &nbsp; SUGAROh , you know  --  Junior League  --  charity bazaars  --  I used to sell kisses for the Milk Fund . They kiss again . &nbsp; JOE ( going , going , gone ) Tomorrow , remind me to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fund . She does n't have to kiss him any more  --  he takes over now . Some time later  --  dawn in fact  --  Sugar and Joe are in the motorboat , gliding away from the Caledonia toward the pier  --  backwards , naturally . It is quite romantic , with the sun about to rise , and incidental music augmenting the mood . Joe and Sugar land at the pier , and with his arm over her shoulder , walk dreamily toward the hotel . From the other direction comes Osgood , twirling the flower in his hand , and humming " La Cumparsita . " As he passes Sugar and Joe , he waves to them jauntily , then continues toward the same motorboat which just deposited them . He gets in , starts the motor , takes off . Joe leads Sugar up to the steps of the hotel , then stops and faces her . &nbsp; JOEGood night .  --  107  --  &nbsp; SUGARGood morning . &nbsp; JOEHow much do I owe the Milk Fund so far ? &nbsp; SUGAREight hundred and fifty thousand dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives her a final kiss . Sugar turns , starts up the steps , then stops and comes back to him . &nbsp; SUGARI forgot to give you your receipt . She kisses him , then floats through the entrance of the hotel . Joe watches her till she is out of sight , then takes off his glasses . He hurries up the steps , climbs up one of the posts of the veranda , and enters Room 413. pp. 65-85 &nbsp; pp. 108-125 INTERIOR  --  JOE AND JERRY 'S HOTEL ROOM Jerry , still in his evening gown , is stretched out on his bed , gaily singing " La Cumparsita " and accompanying himself with a pair of maracas . &nbsp; JOE ( exuberant ) Hi , Jerry .

Section Details INTERIOR  --  HOTEL Later that morning , Spats Colombo enters the hotel lobby , surrounded by his four henchmen and followed by bellhops carrying their luggage . The henchmen are all dolled up for Florida  --  knickers , Panamas , two-toned shoes  --  and one of them is carrying a golf bag . Spats is somewhat more conservatively dressed , in a light gray business suit and white linen spats . They stop and look around .  --  112  --  Draped across the rear wall is an impressive banner reading : Welcome Delegates 10th Annual Convention Friends of Italian Opera &nbsp; SECOND HENCHMAN ( reading banner ) Friends of Eye-talian Opera  --  hey , that 's us ! A convention official , wearing a badge and ribbon identifying him as a committee member , comes up to Spats . &nbsp; FIRST OFFICIALRegister over there . Spats nods to his boys , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of delegates . You would hate to meet any of these mugs in a dark alley , but what makes it heart-warming is that they all have a cauliflower ear for good music . Sitting on a settee is a gentleman reading the Police Gazette . As he lowers the paper , we see it 's our friend Mulligan , the Federal agent . He looks at Spats and his boys with a wry smile . At the desk , Spats and his group are identifying themselves to the registrar . Leaning against a column , supervising the proceedings , is a dark , menacing young hoodlum , Johnny Paradise . He is insolently flipping a half dollar in the air . &nbsp; SPATS ( to registrar ) Spats Colombo  --  delegate from Chicago  --  South Side chapter . The registrar pins an identification tag on his lapel . &nbsp; PARADISEHi , Spats . We was laying eight to one you would n't show . &nbsp; SPATSWhy would n't I ? &nbsp; PARADISEWe thought you was all broken up about Toothpick Charlie . &nbsp; SPATSWell , we all got to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who 's going to be next .

Spats has now been joined by the four henchmen , who have also received their identification tags , and Paradise motions them behind the screen . Behind the screen , a couple of officials are waiting . &nbsp; SECOND OFFICIALPut ' em up , Spats . &nbsp; SPATSWhat 's the idea ? &nbsp; SECOND OFFICIALLittle Bonaparte do n't want no hardware around . Spats reluctantly complies and the official frisks him . &nbsp; SECOND OFFICIAL ( continues ) Okay  --  you 're clean . &nbsp; SPATS ( tapping official 's pocket ) You 're not . He pulls an automatic out of the official 's shoulder holster , tosses it into a wire basket which already holds a large collection of hardware . The official glares at him , then turns and runs his hands down the First Henchman . He feels something at the bottom of one of his knickers , pulls the elastic cuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loaded . The official pulls the elastic of the other knicker , and several dozen bullets drop to the floor . The official kicks them away , faces the henchman with the golf bag . &nbsp; SECOND OFFICIALWhat 's in here ?  --  114  --  &nbsp; SECOND HENCHMANMy golf clubs . Putter , niblick , number three iron  --  The official pulls a submachine gun out of the bag . &nbsp; SECOND OFFICIALWhat 's this ? &nbsp; SECOND HENCHMANMy mashie . Spats emerges from behind the screen . &nbsp; PARADISE ( still tossing coin ) See you at the banquet , Spats . Spats looks at the young punk contemptuously , snatches the coin out of the air . &nbsp; SPATSWhere did you pick up that cheap trick ? ( drops the coin in the kid 's breast pocket ) Come on , boys . He and his henchmen start across the lobby toward the reception counter . As they pass Mulligan , he rises . &nbsp; MULLIGANWell , Spats Colombo  --  if I ever saw one . &nbsp; SPATSHello , copper . What brings you down to Florida ? &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I thought I better be around in case anybody decides to sing . &nbsp; SPATSBig joke ! &nbsp; MULLIGANSay , Maestro  --  where were you at three o'clock on St. Valentine 's Day ? &nbsp; SPATSMe ?

He leads his boys away from Mulligan toward the reception desk .  --  116  --  The elevator door opens , and among the passengers stepping out are Joe and Jerry , in their summer dresses . Joe is carrying their room key . &nbsp; JERRY ( indicating diamond bracelet on wrist ) I feel like such a tramp  --  taking jewelry from a man under false pretenses . &nbsp; JOEGet it while you 're young . And you better fix your lips . You want to look nice for Osgood , do n't you ? Jerry stops , takes a mirror and a lipstick out of his handbag , starts to touch up his lips . &nbsp; JERRYIt 's just going to break his heart when he finds out I ca n't marry him . &nbsp; JOESo ?

What Jerry sees in the mirror is Spats Colombo and the four henchmen . &nbsp; JERRYSomething tells me the omelette is about to hit the fan . He nods in the direction of the reception desk . Joe looks , sees what Jerry has seen , then  --  &nbsp; JOECome on , Daphne . With as much grace as they can muster , they hurry back toward the elevator . The doors are just opening , and the bellhop  --  117  --  comes backing out , trundling an old man in a wheel chair .

Joe and Jerry , hemmed in by the gangsters , are slowly dying . Noticing them , Spats removes his hat , and his henchmen belatedly do likewise . The first henchman stares at Joe and Jerry , who are trying to keep their faces averted . &nbsp; FIRST HENCHMANI do n't mean to be forward  --  but ai n't I had the pleasure of meeting you two broads before ? &nbsp; JOEOh , no ! &nbsp; JERRYYou must be thinking of two other broads . &nbsp; SECOND HENCHMANYou ever been in Chicago ? &nbsp; JERRYUs ?

He follows the others out . &nbsp; JERRY ( coyly ) Do n't call us  --  we 'll call you . As the elevator doors start to close , Spats glances over his shoulder toward the boys , frowning thoughtfully . In the elevator , Joe and Jerry look at each other , swallow hard . Section Details INTERIOR  --  JOE AND JERRY 'S HOTEL ROOM When they get to their room , Joe and Jerry frantically dump their clothes into two open suitcases on the bed . &nbsp; JERRYI tell you , Joe , they 're on to us .

( looking around ) Did we forget anything ? &nbsp; JOE ( still studying cap ) There 's our shaving stuff  --  and there 's Sugar . &nbsp; JERRYSugar ? &nbsp; JOE ( picking up phone ) Get me Room 414 . &nbsp; JERRYWhat do you think you 're doing ? &nbsp; JOEMaking a telephone call . &nbsp; JERRYTelephone call ? Who 's got time for that ? &nbsp; JOEWe ca n't just walk out on her without saying good-bye . &nbsp; JERRYSince when ? Usually you leave ' em with nothing but a kick in the teeth . &nbsp; JOEThat 's when I was a saxophone player . Now I 'm a millionaire .  --  120  --  &nbsp; JERRYDrop her a postcard . Any minute now those gorillas may be up here . . . &nbsp; JOE ( into phone , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the ship-to-shore operator . I have a call for Miss Sugar Cane . Dolores , in a robe and hair-curlers , is at the phone . Sugar , in a negligee , is stretched out on her bed , dreamily reading a copy of Vanity Fair . &nbsp; DOLORESHey , Sugar , it 's for you  --  from the yacht . Sugar jumps up , grabs the phone eagerly . &nbsp; SUGARHello ? &nbsp; JOE ( Cary Grant once more ) Hello , my dearest darling . So good to hear your voice again . &nbsp; JERRYI may throw up . He disappears into the bathroom . &nbsp; JOE ( into phone ) No , I did n't , darling  --  to tell the truth , I never closed an eye . &nbsp; SUGARThat 's funny  --  I never slept better . And I had the most wonderful dream . I was still on the yacht , and the anchor broke loose  --  and we drifted for days and days  --  you were the captain and I was the crew . I kept a lookout for icebergs , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped the steam off your glasses  --  and when I woke up , I felt like swimming right back to you . &nbsp; JOEYes . Now about our date for tonight . . . &nbsp; SUGARI 'll meet you on the pier again  --  right after the show . &nbsp; JOEI 'm afraid not . I ca n't make it tonight .  --  121  --  &nbsp; SUGARTomorrow night ? &nbsp; JOENot tomorrow , either . You see , I have to leave  --  something unexpected came up  --  I 'm sailing right away . &nbsp; SUGARWhere to ? South America ? Oh . That is unexpected . &nbsp; JOEYou see , we have those oil interests in Venezuela  --  and I just got a cable from Dad . The board of directors decided on a merger . &nbsp; SUGARA merger ? How long will you be gone ? &nbsp; JOEQuite a while . As a matter of fact , I 'm not coming back at all . &nbsp; SUGARYou 're not ? &nbsp; JOEIt 's all rather complicated . What we call high finance . But it so happens that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  &nbsp; SUGAROh  - -  that kind of a merger . Is she young ? Pretty ? &nbsp; JOEAccording to our tax advisers , she 's only so-so . But  --  that 's the way the oil gushes . A man in my position has a certain responsibility to the stockholders  --  all those little people who invest their life savings  --  &nbsp; SUGAROh , of course . I understand . At least , I think I do . &nbsp; JOEI knew you would . He picks up the jewel case with the diamond bracelet from the desk , studies it thoughtfully . &nbsp; JOEI only wish there were something I could do for you .  --  122  --  &nbsp; SUGARBut you have . You 've given me all that inside information  --  first thing tomorrow I 'm going to call my broker and have him buy fifty thousand shares of Venezuelan oil . &nbsp; JOE ( into phone ) Smart move . ( reaches into waste basket , extracts corsage box ) Oh , by the way , did you get my flowers ? You know , those orchids from my greenhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they flew them down this morning . As he talks he opens the corsage box , puts the bracelet in with the orchids , closes it again . &nbsp; JOE ( continues ) That 's strange  --  I sent them to your room . They should have been delivered by now  --  Holding the phone in one hand and the corsage box in the other , he moves toward the hall door . Sugar covers the mouthpiece of her phone , turns to Dolores . &nbsp; SUGARHey , Dolores  --  will you see if there are any flowers outside ? Dolores starts toward the hall door . Joe , having come as far as the length of the telephone cord will permit , sets the corsage box down , kicks it across the hall to the door of 414 . As he closes his door , the door of 414 opens . Dolores reaches out , picks up the corsage box , brings it to Sugar . &nbsp; SUGAR ( into phone ) Yes , they 're here . ( opening box ) Oh  --  white orchids . Would you believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a debutante. ( finding bracelet ) What 's this ? &nbsp; JOEWhat 's that ? Oh , that . Just a little going away present .  --  123  --  &nbsp; SUGARReal diamonds . They must be worth their weight in gold . Are you always this generous ? &nbsp; JOENot always . But I want you to know I 'm very grateful for what you did for me . &nbsp; SUGARI did n't do anything . It just happened . Jerry emerges from bathroom , carrying their toilet articles and an armful of towels embroidered with SEMINOLE-RITZ HOTEL . &nbsp; JOE ( into phone ) Oh . The navigator just came in . We 're ready to cast off . &nbsp; SUGARWell , anchors aweigh , and have a bon voyage . And if you need an orchestra to play at your wedding , we 'll be through here in a couple of weeks . &nbsp; JOEGood-bye , my darling . He hangs up , stares moodily at the phone . Jerry shuts his suitcase . &nbsp; JERRYI do n't know about the captain  --  but the navigator is getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of his trance ) Yeah  --  let 's shove off . They start to gather up their instruments and luggage . &nbsp; JERRYWait a minute  --  my bracelet . ( picks up jewel case , shuts it , then realizes it 's empty ) What happened to my bracelet ? &nbsp; JOEWhat do you mean , your bracelet ? It 's our bracelet . &nbsp; JERRYAll right . What happened to our bracelet ? &nbsp; JOEDo n't worry . We did the right thing with it .  --  124  --  &nbsp; JERRYWhat did we do ? Joe , you 're not pulling one of your old tricks . &nbsp; JOENo tricks , no mirrors , nothing up my sleeve . It 's on the level this time . The door opens and Sugar comes in . The boys whirl around . &nbsp; SUGARWhere 's that bourbon ? She heads straight for the bureau , starts to open various drawers . Joe steps in front of the suitcases to conceal them from her . &nbsp; JOEWhat 's the matter , Sugar ? &nbsp; SUGARI do n't know . All of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle out of the open suitcase behind him , hands it to Sugar . As she reaches for it , Jerry notices the diamond bracelet on her wrist . &nbsp; JERRY ( pointing ) How did you get that bracelet ? &nbsp; SUGARYou like it ? &nbsp; JERRYI always did . &nbsp; SUGARJunior gave it to me . It must have at least thirty stones  --  &nbsp; JERRY ( promptly ) Thirty-four . &nbsp; SUGARHe 's going to South America to marry some other girl . That 's what they call high finance . &nbsp; JERRYThat 's what I call a louse ! If I were you , Sugar , I 'd throw that bracelet right back in his face .  --  125  --  &nbsp; JOE ( admonishingly ) Daphne  --  &nbsp; SUGARHe was the first nice guy I ever met in my life  --  and the only one who ever gave me anything . &nbsp; JOEYou 'll forget him , Sugar . &nbsp; SUGARHow can I ? No matter where I go , there 'll always be a Shell station on the corner . ( indicating hot-water bottle ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exits . Jerry turns on Joe furiously . &nbsp; JERRYYou crazy or something ? The place is crawling with mobsters , and you 're making like Diamond Jim Brady ! How are we going to get out of here ? How are we going to eat ? &nbsp; JOEWe 'll walk . And if we have to , we 'll starve . &nbsp; JERRYThere you go with that we again . He picks up his suitcase , starts toward the door . Joe grabs him and pulls him back . &nbsp; JOENot that way . ( heading for window ) We do n't want to run into Spats and his chums . He steps through the open French window onto the balcony . Jerry starts to hand out the instruments and luggage to him . pp. 86-107 &nbsp; pp. 126-139 INTERIOR  --  HOTEL In the suite directly underneath , the four henchmen , in dinner clothes , are playing cards in the lavishly appointed living room when Spats emerges from the bedroom . He is just slipping into his tuxedo coat , and his spats are unbuttoned . &nbsp; SPATS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( The henchman extends his hands palms up , then turns them over ) Okay . Button my spats . He drops into a chair , and the second henchman kneels , starts to button the spats . &nbsp; FIRST HENCHMANSay , boss . I been talking to some of the other delegates  --  and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie . Him and Charlie , they used to be choir boys together . &nbsp; SPATSStop , or I 'll bust out crying . &nbsp; FIRST HENCHMANHe even got Charlie 's last toothpick  --  the one from the garage  --  and had it gold-plated . &nbsp; SPATSLike I was telling you  --  Little Bonaparte is getting soft . ( taps his chest ) He does n't have it here any more . Used to be like a rock . ( shaking his head ) Too bad . I think it 's time for him to retire . &nbsp; SECOND HENCHMANSecond the motion . &nbsp; FIRST HENCHMANHow are we going to retire him ? &nbsp; SPATSWe 'll think of something cute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be singing in the same choir again . He points up . Outside the window , Joe appears , climbing down a post from the floor above . He lands on the balcony , reaches up for the instruments and suitcases which the unseen Jerry is passing down to him . &nbsp; SPATSAnd this time , we 'll make sure there are no witnesses . The first henchman glances out the window , sees Jerry climbing down the post to join Joe . &nbsp; FIRST HENCHMANLook  --  it 's those two broads from the elevator .  --  127  --  Spats turns and looks . The Second Henchman , beaming , crosses to the open window , calls out . &nbsp; SECOND HENCHMANHey  --  join us ! Joe and Jerry , panic-stricken , peer through the Venetian blinds at Spats and his mob . Then they scramble for their lives over the railing of the balcony and down , their hats and wigs knocked askew . &nbsp; SECOND HENCHMANWhat 's the matter with those dames ? &nbsp; SPATSMaybe those dames ai n't dames ! He yanks up the Venetian blinds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railing . Then he picks up the bull fiddle , drags it through the window into the room . &nbsp; SPATSSame faces  --  same instruments  --  ( pointing at bullet holes ) and here 's your Valentine 's card . &nbsp; FIRST HENCHMAN ( catching on ) Those two musicians from the garage ! &nbsp; SPATSThey would n't be caught dead in Chicago  --  so we 'll finish the job here . Come on . Led by Spats , they all dash out of the room . After a moment , Joe 's and Jerry 's heads appear cautiously over the balcony railing . Seeing that the room is empty , they climb up , rush in through the open window . &nbsp; JERRYAll right  --  so what do we do now ? &nbsp; JOEFirst thing we got to do is get out of these clothes . He opens the door to the corridor and they peer out . There is no sign of Spats and his boys . The elevator door is just opening , and the bellhop emerges , pushing the old man in the wheel chair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man into one of the rooms . They look at each other , as the  --  128  --  same idea occurs to them both , nod their heads in agreement . Slipping out of Spats ' room , they cross the corridor to the old man 's room . The elevator doors open at the lobby floor , and a bellhop backs out with a man in a wheel chair . When they turn , we discover that the bellhop is Jerry  --  the uniform fitting him much too snugly  --  and the blanket-covered figure in the wheel chair is Joe , dressed in the old man 's suit , Panama hat , and dark glasses . As Jerry and Joe proceed with dignity toward the front door , we see Spats and his henchmen deployed in strategic positions around the lobby . Jerry wheels Joe past Spats . Spats glances at them casually , then becomes aware of a strange clacking sound . He looks down . There is something decidedly odd about the bellhop  --  because his trouser-legs terminate in high-heeled shoes . Spats , grinning smugly , signals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They start to close in on Joe and Jerry . Jerry abruptly spins the wheel chair around , trundles it toward the rear of the lobby . The other two henchmen take up the chase . Jerry and Joe disappear into a corridor leading toward the rear of the hotel . As the pursuing henchmen start to turn into the corridor , the empty wheel chair comes whizzing toward them . The henchmen stumble over it , become momentarily entangled . Joe and Jerry , sprinting down the corridor , reach an open pantry door , dart inside . The henchmen come racing up , and passing the door , round a bend in the corridor . In the center of the pantry stands a huge cake , and two convention officials are decorating it under the watchful eye of Johnny Paradise , who leans against the wall monotonously tossing a coin into the air . One of the officials , wielding a confectioner 's cone , has almost finished lettering the inscription HAPPY BIRTHDAY , SPATS . Joe and Jerry burst in , and the three hoods look up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scooted across the room and out another door leading to the banquet room .  --  129  --  Joe and Jerry stop to get their bearings . Dominating the room is a U-shaped table , covered with flowers and about thirty place-settings , with a half grapefruit on each plate . On the wall behind the head of the table is a banner welcoming the Friends of Italian Opera . The boys glance around the empty room , make a beeline for the main entrance . As they reach the door , it starts to open , and voices are heard from the corridor . They turn desperately toward a second door , but that too is opening . Trapped , they duck under the banquet table , disappearing behind the long white tablecloth just as the banqueteers start to troop in . They are the same mugs we saw in the lobby , but they are now dressed in tuxedos or white dinner jackets . Chatting amiably , they move to their places at the table . Under the table , Joe and Jerry huddle together as the delegates start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tablecloth directly in front of them  --  and the boys recoil when they see that the owner 's shoes are encased in spats . Spats Colombo is settling himself at the table , while his four henchmen take the seats on either side of him . &nbsp; SPATSWhat happened ? &nbsp; FIRST HENCHMANMe and Tiny , we had them cornered  --  but we lost ' em in the shuffle . &nbsp; SPATS ( turning to other two henchmen ) Where were you guys ? &nbsp; SECOND HENCHMANUs ? We was with you at Rigoletto 's . &nbsp; SPATSWhy , you stupid  --  He picks up the half-grapefruit in front of him , and is about to ram it in the henchman 's face . &nbsp; FIRST HENCHMANIt 's all right , boss  --  we 'll get ' em after the banquet . They ca n't be too far away . Under the table , Joe and Jerry exchange a panicky look . There is a burst of applause from the delegates as through the door strides Little Bonaparte , accompanied by half a dozen  --  130  --  convention officials . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wears a hearing aid . As he proceeds toward the head of the table , his pose is Napoleonic  --  head bowed , hands clasped behind his back . Spats and his henchmen pointedly abstain from applauding . Little Bonaparte remains standing at the place of honor while his associates seat themselves . &nbsp; BONAPARTEThank you , fellow opera-lovers . It 's been ten years since I elected myself president of this organization  --  and if I say so myself , you made the right choice . Let 's look at the record . We have fought off the crackpots who want to repeal Prohibition and destroy the American home  --  by bringing back the corner saloon . We have stamped out the fly-by-night operators who endangered public health by brewing gin in their own bathtubs , which is very unsanitary . We have made a real contribution to national prosperity : we are helping the automobile industry by buying all those trucks , the glass industry by using all those bottles , and the steel industry  --  you know , all those corkscrews . And what 's good for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , our income was a hundred and twelve million dollars before taxes  --  only we ai n't paying no taxes . The delegates applaud . &nbsp; BONAPARTEOf course , like in every business , we 've had our little misunderstandings . Let us now rise and observe one minute of silence in memory of seven of our members from Chicago  --  North Side chapter  --  who are unable to be with us tonight on account of being rubbed out . All the delegates rise and bow their heads  --  except Spats and his henchmen . &nbsp; BONAPARTE ( continues ; sharply ) You too , Spats . Up ! Spats and his boys get up reluctantly , join the others in silent tribute . Back in the pantry , the inscribed top of the cake has been lifted off to reveal a hollow interior . Johnny Paradise is climbing inside . &nbsp; SECOND OFFICIALEasy now . You know when you come out ?  --  131  --  &nbsp; PARADISEYeah . The second time they sing  --  ( singing ) For he 's a jolly good fel-low Which nobody can deny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And do n't mess up the cake . I promised to bring back a piece to my kids . Johnny Paradise squats down inside the cake . The officials set the lid back in place . In the banquet room , the minute of silence is over , and the delegates are seating themselves . Little Bonaparte remains on his feet . &nbsp; BONAPARTENow , fellow delegates , there comes a time in the life of every business executive when he starts to think about retirement . There are cries of " No ! No ! " from the delegates . Little Bonaparte holds up his hand . &nbsp; BONAPARTEIn looking around for somebody to fill my shoes , I 've been considering several candidates . For instance , there is a certain party from Chicago  --  South Side chapter . He glances in the direction of Spats . Spats ' henchmen turn and look at their boss . &nbsp; BONAPARTENow some people say he 's gotten a little too big for his spats  --  but I say he 's a man who 'll go far . Some people say he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't keep a good man down . Of course , he still has a lot to learn . That big noise he made on St. Valentine 's Day  --  that was n't very good for public relations . And letting those two witnesses get away  --  that sure was careless . Under the table , Joe and Jerry try to make themselves as small as possible . &nbsp; SPATSDo n't worry about those two guys  --  they 're as good as dead . I almost caught up with them today .  --  132  --  &nbsp; BONAPARTE ( turning on hearing aid ) You mean you let them get away twice ? Some people would say that was real sloppy  --  but I say to err is human , to forgive divine . And just to show what I think of you , Spats  --  the boys told me you was having a birthday  --  so we baked you a little cake . &nbsp; SPATSMy birthday ? It ai n't for another four months . &nbsp; BONAPARTESo we 're a little early . So what 's a few months between friends ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  now all together  --  ( singing ) For he 's a jolly good fellow . . . . The other delegates , including Spats ' henchmen , join in the song . The lights are extinguished , and from the pantry come the two officials , pushing a cart on which stands the cake , with candles blazing . They wheel the cake up directly in front of Spats , who eyes it uneasily . Little Bonaparte , meanwhile , is conducting the song with relish . As the singers reach the climactic line , the top of the cake tears open and out pops Johnny Paradise . Aiming his machine gun at Spats and his henchmen , he starts blazing away . Under the table , Joe and Jerry cringe . Little Bonaparte winces , turns down the volume of his hearing aid . He ca n't stand loud noises . Spats ' four henchmen have slumped across the table . Spats is clutching his chest . &nbsp; SPATSBig joke ! His eyes close , and he starts to slip out of his chair . Under the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward them , feet first . &nbsp; JOELet 's get out of here . He grabs Jerry , pulls him out from under the table .  --  133  --  The delegates , who are watching Johnny Paradise scramble out of the cake , are momentarily off guard as Joe and Jerry streak across the darkened banquet room toward the pantry door . &nbsp; BONAPARTEGet those two guys ! Four of the officials rush into the pantry after Joe and Jerry . At the same time , the main door opens , and Mulligan strides in . Standing in the corridor behind him are several frightened waiters . Mulligan switches on the lights , looks down at the five corpses . &nbsp; MULLIGANWhat happened here ? &nbsp; BONAPARTE ( blandly ) There was something in that cake that did n't agree with them . Mulligan crosses to the cake , glances inside , then turns to Little Bonaparte . &nbsp; MULLIGANMy compliments to the chef . And nobody 's leaving this room till I get the recipe ! &nbsp; BONAPARTEYou want to make a Federal case out of it ? &nbsp; MULLIGAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Joe and Jerry have bolted out of the rear corridor and pounded up the stairs , followed by two of the officials . A minute after they disappear from sight , the elevator doors open , and out step Joe and Jerry , wearing their wigs and girls ' coats . As the boys mince daintily toward the front door , they see the other two officials coming toward them . They change their course abruptly . The first two officials come hurrying down the stairs . &nbsp; FIRST OFFICIALThey slipped right through our hands .  --  134  --  &nbsp; SECOND OFFICIALDo n't worry . We got our guys watching the railroad station , the roads , and the airport  --  they ca n't get away . &nbsp; JERRY ( to Joe , in a hoarse whisper ) Did you hear that ? &nbsp; JOEYeah , but they 're not watching yachts . Come on  --  you 're going to call Osgood . He steers Jerry toward a row of telephone booths near the entrance to the ballroom . There is an easel sign outside announcing that Sweet Sue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; JERRYWhat 'll I tell him ? &nbsp; JOETell him you 're going to elope with him . &nbsp; JERRYElope ? But there are laws  --  conventions  --  &nbsp; JOE ( jerking his thumb over his shoulder ) There 's a convention , all right . There 's also the ladies ' morque . He shoves Jerry toward a phone booth . Jerry reaches under his coat for a coin , revealing the rolled-up trousers of the bellhop 's uniform underneath . Section Details PHONE BOOTH As Jerry steps into the phone booth , Joe becomes aware of the sound of Sugar 's voice drifting up from the ballroom . She is singing " I 'm Through with Love . " Almost despite himself , Joe appears in the vestibule at the top of the stairs , looks down . From his point of view , we see Sugar perched on top of the piano , bathed in a spotlight . She is a little drunk , and more than a little blue , and she is singing the lyrics with heart-breaking conviction . Joe , watching her from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the steps .  --  135  --  On the bandstand , Sugar is winding up the torchy ballad , when suddenly Joe steps into the spotlight . Without a word , he takes her in his arms , kisses her . &nbsp; SUGAR ( shocked ) Josephine ! ! Nearby , Sweet Sue is watching open-mouthed . &nbsp; SUE ( screaming ) BIENSTOCK ! Bienstock , who is standing near the reservation desk , turns and peers myopically toward the bandstand . At the same time , two of the convention officials come up behind him . &nbsp; SECOND OFFICIAL ( pointing ) Hey  --  that 's no dame ! He and his companion rush toward the bandstand . On the bandstand , Joe is brushing a tear away from Sugar 's cheek . &nbsp; JOE ( in a male voice ) None of that , Sugar  --  no guy is worth it . He catches sight of the two officials bearing down on him , and leaping from the bandstand , shoulders his way through the couples on the dance floor . With the two officials on his heels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all is confusion , as the girls stop playing and stand up . Sugar is staring after Joe in complete bewilderment . &nbsp; SUGARJosephine ? ? ? Suddenly it dawns on her  --  that kiss ! Her eyes widen , her hand flies to her mouth , and she looks with growing comprehension at the bracelet on her wrist . Jerry is just stepping out of the phone booth when Joe bursts out of the ballroom entrance .  --  136  --  &nbsp; JERRYIt 's all fixed ! Osgood is meeting us on the pier  --  &nbsp; JOEWe 're not on the pier yet  --  He grabs Jerry , and they take off across the lobby , as their pursuers appear behind them . The boys head for the front door , but finding their way blocked by the other two officials , they reverse their field and hotfoot it toward the rear corridor . The four officials converge on their trail . Joe and Jerry charge down the rear corridor , go skidding around the corner . As the officials come tooling after them , two ambulance attendants round the turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slab is a body , covered with a sheet that hangs down the sides , and sticking out from the end of the sheet are a pair of spat-covered shoes . The four officials make way for this grisly cargo , then resume the chase . As the ambulance attendants wheel the stretcher toward the lobby , the trailing sheet lifts up , and Joe and Jerry , who have been clinging to the under-carriage , hop out . They tear across the lobby and scoot out the front door . Section Details EXTERIOR  --  PIER On the pier , Osgood is waiting impatiently . He hears something , looks off toward the beach . Jerry and Joe , still wearing their wigs and girls ' coats , come scrambling down the steps , race across the planking toward the pier . On the pier , Osgood 's face lights up . Jerry comes puffing up the stairs , followed by Joe . &nbsp; JERRYThis is my friend Josephine  --  she 's going to be a bridesmaid . &nbsp; OSGOODPleased to meet you . &nbsp; JERRY ( grabbing him ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the stairs leading to the motorboat . &nbsp; OSGOOD ( over his shoulder , to Joe ) She 's so eager ! Swooping down from the beach on a bicycle comes Sugar , pumping like mad . The bicycle bounces down the steps , and Sugar pedals across the planking , sounding her horn . Osgood and Jerry have settled themselves in the front seat of the motorboat , and Joe is getting into the rear seat when he hears the sound of the bicycle horn . He looks back . Osgood starts the motor . Sugar comes racing up the stairs to the pier , leans over the railing . &nbsp; SUGAR ( calling down ) Wait for Sugar ! She hurries toward the other staircase . In the motorboat , Osgood turns to Jerry . &nbsp; OSGOODAnother bridesmaid ? &nbsp; JERRYFlower girl . Sugar comes charging down the stairs , starts to get into the rear seat beside Joe . &nbsp; JOESugar ! What do you think you 're doing ? &nbsp; SUGARI told you  --  I 'm not very bright . &nbsp; JERRY ( clapping Osgood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with a roar . In the back seat , Joe is removing his wig and coat . &nbsp; JOEYou do n't want me , Sugar  --  I 'm a liar and a phony . A saxophone player  --  one of those no-goodnicks you 've been running away from  --   --  138  --  &nbsp; SUGARI know . ( hitting her head ) Every time ! &nbsp; JOEDo yourself a favor . Go back where the millionaires are  --  the sweet end of the lollipop  --  not the cole slaw in the face and the old socks and the squeezed-out tube of toothpaste  --  &nbsp; SUGARThat 's right  --  pour it on . ( twines her arms around his neck ) Talk me out of it . She kisses him resoundingly , bending him over backwards till they are both practically out of sight . Up front , Osgood is blithely steering the boat , keeping his eyes straight ahead . Jerry is looking over his shoulder at the activities in the back seat . &nbsp; OSGOODI called Mama  --  she was so happy she cried  --  she wants you to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JERRY ( steeling himself ) Osgood  --  I ca n't get married in your mother 's dress . She and I  --  we 're not built the same way . &nbsp; OSGOODWe can have it altered . &nbsp; JERRY ( firmly ) Oh , no you do n't ! Look , Osgood  --  I 'm going to level with you . We ca n't get married at all . &nbsp; OSGOODWhy not ? &nbsp; JERRYWell , to begin with , I 'm not a natural blonde . &nbsp; OSGOOD ( tolerantly ) It does n't matter .  --  139  --  &nbsp; JERRYAnd I smoke . I smoke all the time . &nbsp; OSGOODI do n't care . &nbsp; JERRYAnd I have a terrible past . For three years now , I 've been living with a saxophone player . &nbsp; OSGOODI forgive you . &nbsp; JERRY ( with growing desperation ) And I can never have children . &nbsp; OSGOODWe 'll adopt some . &nbsp; JERRYBut you do n't understand ! ( he rips off his wig ; in a male voice ) I 'm a MAN ! &nbsp; OSGOOD ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Osgood , who is grinning from ear to ear , claps his hand to his forehead . How is he going to get himself out of this ? But that 's another story  --  and we 're not quite sure the public is ready for it . pp. 108-125 &nbsp;
