Offstage He Is More Like Himself <P> In the fading light of a hot summer day last week , Adlai Stevenson and a few friends left the Chicago Yacht Club , got into a taxi , and headed back to his living quarters at the Sheraton-Blackstone Hotel . Three days before , Harry Truman had struck . Stevenson was still crowding his hours with visits and visitors , handshakes , receptions , whisperings , conferences . Yet the crucial matters of the moment now seemed strangely suspended , like a mural of some bygone battle posted on a restaurant wall . It was a lovely yacht club , Stevenson mused ; the new terrace was a perfect place for outdoor entertaining . Had anybody noticed the large number of yachts moored near by ? How did the Chicago Cubs make out ( Cubs 0 , Redlegs 2 ) ? When the taxi stopped at his hotel , an aide turned Stevenson 's attention to a car flying a " Stevenson for President " banner . Stevenson gave a perfunctory look , blinked , appeared to do a double-take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfurled admiration . " Hello ! " he shouted . " Thanks-thanks a lot ! " <P> The curious self-detachment of Adlai Ewing Stevenson , 5-mortared with solid ribs of shyness , intellectualism , and an abiding sense of correctness - is the base of his perplexing personality , and still puzzle of the politicos . <P> " Observe , Persist , Learn . " The personality was nourished by a quiet , perceptive , Quaker-bred mother , an outgiving father , Lewis Green Stevenson ( business manager for 45 Midwestern farms , Illinois Secretary of State , 1914-1916 ) , and a wealth of family pride . Great-grandfather Jesse Fell was a close friend of Lincoln 's , suggested the Lincoln- Douglas debates , worked for Lincoln 's presidential campaign . Adlai 's Democratic paternal grandfather and namesake was Vice President in Grover Cleveland 's second Administration , and the old campaign posters still decorate Adlai 's den in Libertyville . Adlai 's birth naturally prompted his Grandfather William O. Davis ( a Republican ) to pronounce himself delighted at the " launching of this little presidential craft . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ill . Adlai absorbed the family sense of duty , his mother 's intense intellectual curiosity . She read him the classics ( Dickens , Scott ) , pumped him with such copybook admonitions as " Observe , persist , learn . " " Keep pacid and cheerful , knowing all things come to those who love the Lord and do His works . " After prep school ( Choate ) came Princeton . To the list of heroes that included Lincoln . Great-grandfather Fell and Grandfather Stevenson Adlai added a new one : Princetonian Woodrow Wilson , whom he had met in 1912 . Of all the figures in the Democratic pantheon , Idealist Woodrow Wilson is still Stevenson 's personal favorite .
