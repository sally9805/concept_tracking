SCENE : It 's near the end of the fifth century B.C. in Athens , and we are in the house of Socrates indicated by props , not sets . XANTIPPE , Socrates ' wife , is setting some breakfast before their three sons , meanwhile talking to Socrates in the next room and to the boys also . The eldest , Lamprocles , is eighteen or more , the second son , Lysis , is eleven or twelve , the third , little Phoenix , is a youngster . XANTIPPE You may as well eat . We have no truck with etiquette in this house . He 'll come to breakfast when he 's thought it all over . LAMPROCLES He 's thinking of shaving . Somebody made him a present of a bronze razor . XANTIPPE Shaving ! LYSIS You think he will ? LAMPROCLES Well , why not ? LYSIS I hope he does . XANTIPPE Why ? LYSIS I just hope he does . XANTIPPE I hope he does n't . Socrates ? SOCRATES Off stageYes , Xantippe ? XANTIPPE Are you shaving ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm trying the edge on a few stray hairs . XANTIPPE Leave it the way it is . At least part of your face is covered . LYSIS At the field they  --  ah  --  XANTIPPE Yes ? LYSIS For a long while they did n't know he was my father . They made fun of his bare feet and his funny whiskers  --  and I did n't say anything . But now they know and SOCRATES entersAre n't you going to shave , father ? SOCRATES I decided against it . Fear of the unknown , I suppose . Who knows what 's underneath ? It might be worse . He sits XANTIPPE That 's optimism . But it certainly would n't do any harm for you to trim your beard , and to wear sandals and proper clothes . Still , it 's no good talking . You 'll do as you 've always done . She touches his shoulderYour robe 's unpinned . SOCRATES Rising to adjust itBy the dog , if this civilization of ours is ever dug up , or leaves any pictures of itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at this fantastic rig we wear  --  look at this chiton or himation or whatever it is  --  p. 4 XANTIPPE It 's been both in its time , and it 's neither now . SOCRATES Well , look at it  --  it does n't keep you warm in winter , it does n't keep you cool in summer , it does n't shed rain , it does n't turn wind ; it hobbles you when you walk , it trips you up when you run , and it ties you in knots when you fall down ! XANTIPPE A new one would be simpler to fasten , but you 'd manage to look comical in anything you wore , I 've learned that . SOCRATES Is there money for a new one ? XANTIPPE Not unless you brought money home with you last night . SOCRATES That 's what I forgot ! Simmias owes me ten drachmas on an old debt , but we stood so long talking about the war that I forgot to ask for it . XANTIPPE Ten drachmas ! That 's a fortune ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our thinking , my dear . What 's your definition of a fortune ? XANTIPPE Any amount that takes a load off your mind ! Any amount in excess of two obols , which is what we have in the house at present ! I was about to send Lamprocles to the market to buy a fish with one obol . The other  --  I suppose we could just throw it around . p. 5 LAMPROCLES RisingFather ? SOCRATES Yes , Lamprocles . LAMPROCLES If you have that much money there 's a contingent of heavy-armed foot soldiers leaving for the south tomorrow . I 'm all trained and ready , and if I had three drachmas to buy a sword and shield I could go with them . SOCRATES Could you buy a sword and shield for three drachmas ? LAMPROCLES They 've been used , but they 're in good shape . XANTIPPE They 're in better shape than the soldier who used them , I 'm certain of that . SOCRATES The truth is , Simmias sails with supplies for the fleet this morning , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go the ten drachmas . XANTIPPE Well , for once I thank Zeus for our poverty ! Why would you want to go with the army ? LAMPROCLES To fight for Athens . XANTIPPE You 're not old enough ! LAMPROCLES I 'm exactly the age they 're asking for . XANTIPPE If you had any brains you 'd stay out of it . p. 6 LAMPROCLES My father fought for Athens . XANTIPPE I know  --  the famous barefoot campaign  --  barefoot he fought , barefoot he won  --  the others were freezing all about him , but he marched sturdily on over ice and snow in his one ragged garment , filling his comrades with courage and the enemy with despair . And what did we get out of it ? The war 's still going on . It 's been going on twenty-six years and we 're twenty-six times worse off now than we were when it started  --  LAMPROCLES But we ca n't stop ! XANTIPPE You 've been stopped by your father 's improvidence , and a lucky thing , too . It 's best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to choose from . She finds a copper in her leather purse and hands it to him LAMPROCLES Very well . SOCRATES I 'm sorry , son . LAMPROCLES It does n't matter . I 'll find the money sooner or later . He goes out . SOCRATES takes a bite XANTIPPE Would you let him go into the war ? SOCRATES Strangely enough , I find that I do n't want him to go . Yet I allowed myself to go , and other young men are going . It 's a problem . p. 7 XANTIPPE This is our son , our son , Socrates ! Will you quit thinking of everything as a problem and come to some conclusion ? SOCRATES Sometimes I think the earth is not well equipped with conclusions . XANTIPPE In the name of Pallas Athena , what does that mean ? SOCRATES What it says  --  that nothing is decided , nothing ever concluded , nothing comes to an end . XANTIPPE Men come to an end in battle ! SOCRATES Yes , that 's the nearest there is to an end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If there 's anything more infuriating than words it 's more words ! SOCRATES Let 's be silent . They eat LYSIS Father ? SOCRATES Yes ? LYSIS You know those sandals that Alcibiades gave you for a joke one time ? SOCRATES I know them very well . They still hang on my wall . LYSIS Do they fit you ? SOCRATES They look as if they would . LYSIS Would you put them on once a day just for me ? p. 8 SOCRATES What is this you ask  --  once a day ? LYSIS Father when you walk down to the city in the morning you pass the athletic field where I am with the other boys of my age . And they laugh at you , because you do n't wear shoes or sandals . Could n't you put them on  --  and wear them when you pass the field  --  and then take them off ? SOCRATES Lysis , my poor Lysis . He puts an arm around Lysis LYSIS Will you wear them ? SOCRATES They 'd laugh at me with or without sandals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lysis , are the boys happy when they laugh or unhappy ? LYSIS Oh , they 're happy , but I 'm not . SOCRATES Then I cause great happiness by not wearing sandals ! LYSIS Leaping from the table I tell you I ca n't go there any more if you 're to pass by like that every morning and be laughed at ! I tell you they laugh till they fall on the ground and roll ! I ca n't stand it , and I ca n't go there , and I hate them and I hate you if you 're going to be a laughing stock ! You could put on the sandals just to go by and then take them off ! You could  --  He breaks off and weeps p. 9 SOCRATES The truth is , I could n't put them on . LYSIS Yes you could ! You just wo n't ! It 's some kind of silly pride ! SOCRATES I thought perhaps it was pride , and I examined that  --  LYSIS Oh , you examined and you discussed  --  I know  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're my most stubborn antagonist , son  --  next to your mother . But there is a way round this difficulty . I 'll take the upper path when I walk down to the market , and they wo n't see me at all . LYSIS You will ? SOCRATES Of course I will . I like a change of habits . LYSIS Will you go that way this morning ? SOCRATES Indeed I will . They sha n't see any trace of me  --  nose , belly , or feet . LYSIS That 's  --  that 's wonderful ! It 's late ! I 'll go now ! He runs out PHOENIX I want to play at the spring . XANTIPPE Do n't stray beyond the plane tree . PHOENIX No , mother . He goes out . She looks out after him , then returns to Socrates p. 10 XANTIPPE We 're at rock bottom , Socrates . We have one obol in the house and no prospect of more . Socrates , when I married you I was madly in love with you . SOCRATES Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some affection left . XANTIPPE At any rate , I was madly in love and I brought you a little money . Not much , but I collect a little silver every quarter , and it used to be enough so that we could live , even when you brought nothing home . But the war goes on and on and money buys less and less , till now it 's not enough . It 's not half enough , and you must earn a little or we 'll starve . SOCRATES Those ten drachmas are due me for work done on the pillars of Simmias ' house thirty years ago , when I was still a stonecutter . I could work at that again . XANTIPPE No , you could n't . You could no more do that than you could wear sandals ; but there 's one thing you could do , you could take money for the lessons you give . SOCRATES I give no lessons . XANTIPPE You have a large following , and you are held in greater esteem than any other teacher in Athens . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it ! He lifts his handBe quiet ! Let me finish : I know of at least six other teachers in Athens  --  Hippias , Prodicus , Gorgias , Polus , and Callicles  --  and every one of them is well paid , well dressed , well fed and solvent . And you could be ! p. 11 SOCRATES If I took money for what I say I 'd be cheating my listeners , for I truly know nothing . All I have is a kind of skill in argument  --  XANTIPPE And that 's what they go to you for ! That 's what they use you for ! Alcibiades did it , and Critias , and dozens of others ! These young men spend a few years with you , and suddenly they 're great orators and powers in the state , while here you sit just as before , in the same old shirt and probably the same old dirt , because you 've never been quite sure that bathing was good for people ! SOCRATES When you are searching for truth , my dear , money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taking it and you 'll steer toward where the money is , not toward the truth . XANTIPPE I know your intentions are good  --  Hades , as we know , is paved with good intentions  --  SOCRATES I 'm happy to hear that it 's paved at all . I 'll probably spend a good deal of time there . XANTIPPE You will not charge money for lessons ? SOCRATES No , I will not . XANTIPPE How are we to live ? SOCRATES I 'll sell those sandals Alcibiades gave me . The workmanship is fabulous . p. 12 XANTIPPE And after that ? SOCRATES Who knows ? XANTIPPE It 's not only the money , Socrates . It 's that you 're not liked . You 're hated by many people . Hated because you refuse to fit in . SOCRATES Perhaps because they have no hold over me . XANTIPPE You see  --  I 'm afraid for you . If you 'd set up as a teacher and were paid you 'd be one of them  --  they 'd accept you . But as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horsefly of Athens , and you sting the most respectable people on their least respectable parts . You ca n't expect to be popular . SOCRATES No , a horsefly is never popular among horses . XANTIPPE Turning awayIt 's no use . I 'm thinking of you and how to help you , and you think I 'm thinking of myself . SOCRATES I was in love with you when we married , Xantippe . I 'm an old codger now , but I 'm still in love with you as much as an ancient party can be  --  XANTIPPE Yes , I know about that . You explained at one of those bachelor revels you attend that you wanted to achieve self-control  --  and a debater who could keep his temper in the same house with Xantippe was equal to anything . So you married me. p. 13 SOCRATES Who told you that ? XANTIPPE Oh , a lot of people came running to me with that . SOCRATES A man says a lot of things to amuse the company , but I never said quite that . XANTIPPE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come right after Athens  --  next to the city of Athens I love you best . XANTIPPE Yes , after the entire city of Athens  --  SOCRATES No , after the beauty of the city of Athens , and after its art and wisdom and knowledge , I love you best and I 've always loved you best . He goes to her and puts his arms about herI 'm a horrible old satyr , and enough to frighten any woman , but if you can overlook that I 'm as much yours as you 're mine . It 's not much of a life for you  --  XANTIPPE Who cares about that and who cares about a man 's looks ? I 'm no beauty . I was homely to begin with and I have n't improved . I was lucky to get you . I 'd have been lucky to get anybody , but that does n't mean I 'm willing to share you with somebody else ! I 've never believed this story of yours that it 's Athens you 're in love with . There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than once . p. 14 SOCRATES Let 's not be ridiculous ! Perfume ! He moves away from her XANTIPPE There are women at these feasts of reason you attend . SOCRATES Flute-players and dancers and entertainers , yes , sometimes . XANTIPPE One particular woman with one particular perfume ! SOCRATES Years ago then , so long that I 've forgotten it . XANTIPPE So it was n't Athens , after all ! SOCRATES If you 're thinking of the thing that makes a man wake in the morning happy to be alive , happy there 's a new day to live , yes , it was Athens . I wish I could tell you what I feel for this city , Xantippe ! This Athens , a gathering of slaves and free men , of artists and unprincipled traitors , of staggering genius and sure-footed dolts , of soaring altars to the gods built with stolen money , of levelheaded madmen who speak like their own goddess of wisdom and then filch the gold fringe from that goddess 's image , a pack of poets who are generals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of men who are paragons of virtue and evil , who have done everything a man should do , and also everything he should not ! A hive of inspired and brainy and reckless idiots , who love the arts more than money , and fame more than the arts , and politics more than all three ! How they have done it I do n't know , and they do n't , but they 've built such a city here as the gods must have been thinking of when they first made men  --  a city drowned in sunlight and dancing and music and wisdom and deviltry , and crowned with the mystic marbles of the Parthenon ! p. 15 XANTIPPE There was a woman too . SOCRATES Very well , there was a woman , a long time ago  --  but Athens has been the great love of my life , and after Athens , you . This is a golden place and we have lived through a golden age . XANTIPPE I 've lived mostly in the kitchen . In the age of iron pots . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much you love Athens it does n't love you . It loves beauty and glamour and success and it resents you for going about asking embarrassing questions . SOCRATES I have many friends . XANTIPPE You have a following , but if you want Athens to like you you do everything wrong . I know you want to do everything right , and that 's why you eat little and wear old clothes and take no money and try to get at the truth . But Athens still wants beauty and glamour and success  --  not an old man in bare feet pointing out that the human race does n't know its ass from its elbow . SOCRATES But it does ! That 's one of the few things it does know ! LAMPROCLES Calling from outsideFather ! Father ! He runs inFather , there 's an indictment of you hung up in the government building ! p. 16 SOCRATES An indictment of me ? LAMPROCLES Yes , of you ! XANTIPPE Oh , God ! CRITO and his son CRITOBULUS enter , followed by PHAEDO . Crito and Phaedo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well to do , a fact which is reflected only in the quality of their dress , for the costume is unvarying LAMPROCLES Crito took it down . XANTIPPE Oh , God help us ! LAMPROCLES Mother , you forget ! You should go to the women 's quarters . XANTIPPE Oh , should I ? In a house when there 's only one woman and she mistress , wife , mother , and slave , I see little sense in women 's quarters ! SOCRATES There 's sense in that , Lamprocles . And Xantippe knows Crito , Critobulus , and Phaedo as well as we do . Come in , all three . Xantippe must hear this . CRITO It must have been hung up early this morning . I happened to notice it on my way to the jury room . It 's very short : " We three citizens of Athens , Meletos , Anytas , and Lycon , bring this charge against Socrates  --  that he is guilty of crime , first because he does not worship the gods of our city , but introduces new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thinking of our young men . We make this charge and demand an immediate trial . The penalty due is death . " p. 17 XANTIPPE I knew this would happen ! SOCRATES I did n't . It 's better than I could have hoped for . They 've delivered themselves into my hands . They are fools in an argument , all of them . XANTIPPE But they 'll have you killed ! SOCRATES Perhaps you should go into the women 's quarters , Xantippe . XANTIPPE To LamproclesGive me the fish , then . Somebody must cook , whatever happens . Give me the fish . LAMPROCLES What fish ? XANTIPPE You were sent for a fish . LAMPROCLES I did n't go to the market . I met Crito . XANTIPPE Then where 's the obol ? LAMPROCLES What is the matter with you , mother ? Will you be quiet and go ? XANTIPPE You were given an obol to buy fish ! LAMPROCLES Giving her the coinHere ! Who wants an obol now ? XANTIPPE I do . We have only two , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen . I take my smaller brain to another apartment . She goes out p. 18 LAMPROCLES What is the meaning of this ? Why should they suddenly demand my father 's death ? PHAEDO It 's no sudden thing . It 's been coming for a long time . SOCRATES It 's a heaven-sent opportunity to defend my way of life in open court . And Athens will laugh them into exile . In any other city there 'd be doubt of the outcome . Here , among the clear heads of the merry Greeks it 's unalloyed good fortune . I 'll win and they 'll pay and never hear the end of it . CRITO And yet , if you could avoid this trial , I 'd hope for that . SOCRATES I would n't . The lesser divinity that gets so exercised when I 'm about to do something wrong has said not a word of protest . If he were concerned he 'd have me out of town before nightfall . Not a peep from him . He 's happy . A pretty woman of thirty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her firstTheodote ! Why have you come here ? THEODOTE Forgive me . Forgive me for the news I bring . I bring the most terrible news that could come to Athens . CRITO We know about the indictment . THEODOTE Forget the indictment . Forget all your lives up to this time . We have lost the war . Athens has been beaten at Aegospotami . We have lost our fleet . Our city , which has ruled so long , is at the mercy of Sparta . I come to tell this to the one great man left out of the great age of Athens . Pericles is dead , Herodotus is dead . Sophocles , too , and Euripides  --  and Alcibiades . I bring the message to Socrates . XANTIPPE re-enters and listens p. 19 SOCRATES Where did you hear it ? THEODOTE Three runners came from Piraeus . The Spartans won by sheer trickery  --  from us who have always won by trickery  --  who have outtricked the world . Four mornings in a row our fleet approached their harbor and offered battle . Each morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after our fleet had returned to its base and anchored and dismissed the men to baths and breakfast , the Spartan fleet appeared round the point , took our men and admirals off guard , captured every ship , every man  --  butchered many , saved a few of the wealthy to be ransomed . King Pausanias of Sparta is at Piraeus now . He offers no terms , demands abject surrender . LAMPROCLES Never ! XANTIPPE What will you fight with ? With that secondhand sword and shield you were planning to buy ? SOCRATES Has the Assembly been called ? THEODOTE It 's meeting at midday , at the government building . SOCRATES It 's near midday now . We 'll all be needed there . Come , gentlemen . The men go out , leaving the two women . THEODOTE starts to go XANTIPPE Then there 's to be no trial ? p. 20 THEODOTE There 's no time for such things now . XANTIPPE Thank God for that much . Who are you ? THEODOTE Theodote . You are Xantippe ? XANTIPPE I am . THEODOTE I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt . THEODOTE I 've heard of your talent for invective . XANTIPPE From whom ? THEODOTE That 's a professional secret . XANTIPPE Yes , of course . You 're a strumpet . THEODOTE Oh , why put it so mildly ? An alien whore from Ionia , a foreign bitch with all the advantages and accomplishments denied the native born . XANTIPPE An excellent debater 's trick . Always describe your vices as virtues . You learned that from Socrates ? THEODOTE Anybody who has studied under a Sophist has learned that trick . XANTIPPE You have studied under Sophists ? THEODOTE I was never sure whether I was learning or teaching . XANTIPPE If you were doing what I think , you were teaching , dear child , you were teaching . May I look at the hem of your himation ? p. 21 THEODOTE Backing awayThere 's nothing unusual about it . XANTIPPE Stand still , Ionian , I wo n't hurt you . She smells the garmentYes , it was your perfume he brought home . THEODOTE That water-drinking old Silenus of yours ? Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now I know . PHOENIX comes in PHOENIX Mother , there are many soldiers in the street , and they march and wo n't look at me ! THEODOTE The Spartans ! XANTIPPE Yes , go to your work and double your prices . Find yourself an officer . Take him to bed . THEODOTE Keep to your kitchen , wife . Save what food you have . She goes PHOENIX I want to see the soldiers . XANTIPPE No , stay with me . It 's not safe outside . They go out END OF SCENE p. 22 Act 1 , Scene 2 Act OneSCENE 2 SCENE : Several months later . Socrates , Phaedo , Crito , Anytas , Lycon Crassos , Meletos , and Critobulus are working with crowbars to overturn a section ( or fragment ) of the city wall . SOCRATES Another bar or two under this side , friends , and we 'll have it down to the required level . CRITO I can never get used to tearing down the walls of my own city . SOCRATES It 's better not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tear down our walls  --  and the Spartans will be on our necks here till it 's done . We 'd better appear to be working . Satyros is approaching . SATYROS , a gigantic thug carrying a whip and followed by two other thugs , likewise armed , comes in and watches or a moment SATYROS Turn this way ! The workers turn to face SatyrosThere has been loitering here ! I saw it ! Let me remind you of the decree ! The treaty between Sparta and Athens provides that the walls of Athens be razed to the ground by her own citizens ! The work is nearly done , but now a few fools say they will do no more ! Critias and King Pausanias are inspecting the work at this moment , and no excuses will be accepted ! Those who loiter will be whipped ! Those who refuse  --  will be killed ! Put your weight behind those tools ! The group resumes its work . CRITIAS and KING PAUSANIAS enter . Critias is an elegant and intelligent Athenian ; Pausanias is unpolished , slow moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of noise with their toolsDo n't disturb the king and the general , you there ! Take yourselves a bit further off ! SOCRATES and the men with him move off stage , but can still be heard chunking and prying . SATYROS follows them p. 23 CRITIAS The work has gone slowly , King Pausanias , but , as you can see , it 's nearly finished . PAUSANIAS Lord love you , do n't call me King Pausanias . The name 's long enough without the handle . CRITIAS I shall feel insolent if I give you no title , O King  --  PAUSANIAS Your name 's Critias , is n't it ? You 're the brilliant Critias . CRITIAS I am Critias , yes . PAUSANIAS All right , I 'll call you Brilliant and you call me Stupid , the way they do in Sparta  --  CRITIAS Stupid  --  ? PAUSANIAS Bless you , yes  --  Stupid . In Sparta all the kings are called Stupid , and they are stupid . That 's really the only qualification of the royal house down there . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second cousin has learned to read during the last three centuries . CRITIAS But you read , of course ? PAUSANIAS Read ? I ca n't write my name ! A monarch who could read would be booted out of Laconia . And rightly , too . Stupid I was born , stupid I live , stupid I shall die , and the better king for it ! CRITIAS I suspect that you are not quite forthright  --  p. 24 PAUSANIAS No , no ! I tell the simple stupid truth about everything . That 's the advantage of having a fool for a king . A fool can afford to be sincere . Everybody trusts him . So trust me , come on . Be my friend , call me Stupid . CRITIAS I ca n't . PAUSANIAS Satyros , come here ! SATYROS re-entersI order you to call me Stupid . CRITIAS In an agony of indecisionYes  --  Stupid . PAUSANIAS Good . Now we can be friends , Brilliant . That 's all , Satyros . SATYROS goes outYou were about to tell me something when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report . PAUSANIAS Put it in words of one syllable , please . CRITIAS Surely . It was easy to destroy democracy here in Athens , but it 's not so easy to make the Athenians like the oligarchy which we have set up in its place . As the head of the thirty oligarchs I am extremely unpopular . PAUSANIAS How do you know ? CRITIAS Remarks are made about me , even to my face , which leave no doubt . p. 25 PAUSANIAS You could strangle those who make remarks , Brilliant . CRITIAS Yes , we could , St  --  O King  --  but my method has been to entrust them with authority . PAUSANIAS The leaders who oppose you  --  you give them authority ? CRITIAS Yes . PAUSANIAS Why do n't they continue to oppose you when in office ? CRITIAS Well , they do n't . They 're on our side , you see . They 've taken money from our treasury . They 're involved in what we 're doing . PAUSANIAS I see . CRITIAS After that their hands are n't any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuts them up . PAUSANIAS Blackmail . CRITIAS That 's not the word we use . PAUSANIAS It 's a word I know . Two syllables , but familiar . CRITIAS Well , we find these men , talk to them , and bring them over to our side . At the moment the most outspoken and venomous of our opponents is this man Socrates whom you saw working here just now  --  PAUSANIAS Socrates ? CRITIAS You know the name ? p. 26 PAUSANIAS Everybody knows about him . He 's the one that goes barefoot and talks but never writes anything down . I should like to see him . CRITIAS He 's in that labor gang . PAUSANIAS I should like to hear him talk , too . CRITIAS Nothing easier to arrange . He callsSatyros ! To the kingHe 'll talk you blind . SATYROS entersBring that group here . SATROS goes out , can be heard calling SATYROS This way , dogs ! This way , Athenians ! Bring your tools . SOCRATES and the others enter CRITIAS The king of Sparta has expressed a wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear him say , O King ? SATYROS re-enters PAUSANIAS I want to hear him talk the way he talks . One of those question and answer things people are always telling about . CRITIAS You hear , Socrates ? SOCRATES With whom shall I speak , my dear Critias ? CRITIAS With anybody . p. 27 SOCRATES Very well . King Pausanias  --  PAUSANIAS No , no , I do n't want to be tied up in knots ! Choose a social equal . SOCRATES Surely . Anytas , we began a conversation a moment ago  --  CRITIAS Good . Complete it  --  for the king . SOCRATES I believe the last thing you said was that you were my enemy ? ANYTAS It was ! You 've spent your whole life pulling Athens down , stone by stone , and this is a fitting climax to your work ! The defeat of Athens , the thousands dead of famine and pestilence , the pestilential government that rules us now under Sparta 's orders , these are all the result of Socrates ' teachings ! SOCRATES Please answer my question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you my enemy ? ANYTAS I am ! SOCRATES Anytas , is a man 's enemy one who does evil to him ? ANYTAS He is . SOCRATES And is a man 's friend one who does good to him ? ANYTAS He is . SOCRATES Now , Anytas , my friends tell me that I am a wise teacher and a philosopher of parts . Is that true ? p. 28 ANYTAS It is not . It 's a lie . SOCRATES Then my friends flatter me and lie to me ? ANYTAS They do . SOCRATES Is that good for me ? Anytas hesitatesIs that good for me ? ANYTAS No . SOCRATES My enemies , on the other hand , tell me bluntly to my face that I am a fool and a windbag . Is that good for me ? ANYTAS It 's the truth ! SOCRATES But is it good for me ? ANYTAS How do I know ? SOCRATES Are you afraid to answer ? PAUSANIAS By God , if he answers he 'll contradict himself ! CRITIAS That 's true . That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be told that I am a fool and windbag ? ANYTAS Yes , damn you , yes ! Because you are ! SOCRATES But you began by saying that a friend was one who did good to a man and an enemy was one who did evil  --  and you end by saying that the friend does evil to him and the enemy does good . p. 29 PAUSANIAS Wonderful ! Now that I understand ! Philosophy without one two-syllable word ! CRITIAS Do not be misled by him , O King ; he is your mortal enemy and mine , and no matter how much his tricks may amuse us the state we have set up here will not be safe while men like him go about questioning the wisdom of the gods and the accuracy of common definitions . SOCRATES Perhaps you should n't blame me if your state is unsafe , Critias . No state is safe , no definition is quite accurate . CRITIAS Do n't hide behind that ! You attack us daily . You attack the present government and defend democracy ! SOCRATES Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down the streets questioning and doubting . PAUSANIAS I 'd like to ask this man a stupid question . CRITIAS You 'll get a stupid answer , but ask it . PAUSANIAS When Athens and Sparta were enemies did Athens do good to Sparta ? SOCRATES Much good , O King . PAUSANIAS Will you make that clear to me ? SOCRATES Is a victory good or evil ? PAUSANIAS Good . p. 30 SOCRATES Is a victory possible without an enemy ? PAUSANIAS No . SOCRATES Was not the victory of Sparta made possible by her enemy Athens ? PAUSANIAS Yes , by the loins of Helen , yes ! And did Sparta do good to Athens ? SOCRATES Yes . When you took our freedom from us , then for the first time we realized what a precious thing freedom is ! LYCON Oh , stay with him ! Go right on asking him questions ! He 'll teach you that up is down and east is west and left is right and young is old and a father is no wiser than his son and the gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not ! He 'll ask you if you 're sure that left is always left and right is always right , and then he 'll show you that it depends on the point of view , and then he 'll point out that because a man 's in authority does n't always mean he 's right , and even parents know less about their children 's diseases than a doctor knows and  --  ! LYCON And what a string of rubbish that is ! SOCRATES There 's truth in what your father says , Crassos . Too much zeal has made you incoherent . And yet every point you tried to make could have been made , and convincingly , if you had taken your time and found the right words . p. 31 CRASSOS I 'm sorry SOCRATES But nobody is born with poise . Even kings have to learn that . PAUSANIAS Is this what you call democracy ? CRITIAS This is democracy . Have you had enough of it ? May I change the subject now ? PAUSANIAS Yes . But democracy is as stupid as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , O King . But free ! CRITIAS To SatyrosTake them out . All but this man . He points to Socrates . SATYROS and his thugs march the labor gang out , leaving Socrates , Critias , and PausaniasYou were my first teacher , Socrates . You are still my master , even though I am by accident master of Athens for this moment . I learned everything I know about the art of government from you . We have differed lately over methods and over what 's expedient , but we both want the same thing : the best government that can be had for our great and beloved city . SOCRATES What do you want of me , Critias ? CRITIAS Nothing , Socrates . Only your good will . SOCRATES If you wanted nothing you would not spray me with this expert nonsense . XANTIPPE enters , carrying a stone jug and food wrapped in what looks like a cabbage leaf p. 32 CRITIAS What is your errand ? XANTIPPE I 'm bringing food for Socrates . CRITIAS Leave it . Or come back later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one lightly sends away . XANTIPPE I 'll come back . She goes out the way she came CRITIAS You are aware , Socrates , as well as I , that a man who governs a nation sits in a lonely place with great decisions in his hands , knowing that he is not worthy to make them and yet that they must be made .  --  SOCRATES What do you want of me , Critias ? CRITIAS Now unfortunately the government which we have here at present is not the democracy you love , yet it is the government of Athens , and if Athens is to endure through these dark days of defeat her government must be made effective . PAUSANIAS yawns  --  rises to look out SOCRATES What do you want me to do , Critias ? CRITIAS Very well . There is , on the island of Salamis , a rich and unscrupulous man named Leon who openly defies Athens and has sworn that he will contribute nothing to the treasury while the Thirty are in power . The Thirty wishes you to sit in judgment at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as a judge . He has been indicted under the laws ? CRITIAS His crimes are so open and flagrant that there seems no need for formal indictment . XANTIPPE returns and listens , unseen by Critias or Socrates SOCRATES But how can a judge act if there is no indictment ? CRITIAS You have said that you will act . SOCRATES As a judge , according to the laws . CRITIAS We have been obliged to abrogate the usual laws and set up special panels for trying these cases . You would sit as a member of such a panel . SOCRATES There would be other judges on this case ? CRITIAS There will be five altogether . SOCRATES I should be one among five . My voice would hardly count . CRITIAS Your presence would count for a great deal . SOCRATES It is likely that Leon would be found guilty ? CRITIAS It is very likely . SOCRATES Not certain ? CRITIAS Perhaps certain . p. 34 SOCRATES And what is the probable penalty ? CRITIAS Death , I should think , for such a crime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disobedience to the Thirty ? CRITIAS Yes . SOCRATES turns his head as if listening SOCRATES No , Critias , I shall not sit on such a court . CRITIAS Before you say no finally , Socrates , let me warn you that I am not alone in the government , and that I am not always able to control it . If you sit with this court you will be part of the government and fairly safe . If you do not accept the position on the panel it may be that you yourself will be brought before just such a judge as I ask you to become . Why are you silent ? SOCRATES I am listening . CRITIAS To whom ? SOCRATES There is a little fellow , invisible and nameless , who sits on my ear at such moments and whispers to me . He is saying something now . CRITIAS Listen , then . I shall give you  --  while that eagle crosses the sky . THEODOTE enters opposite Xantippe . She carries an elegant flask , a basket of food , and a bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stageWhat is your errand here , sweetheart ? THEODOTE I 'm bringing food for Anytas , darling . PAUSANIAS That reminds me , I 'm famishing . THEODOTE This is not for you . PAUSANIAS Do you think Anytas would mind ? THEODOTE He paid for it , lover . PAUSANIAS But I 'm devilish hungry ! THEODOTE Does that make a difference ? PAUSANIAS It had better . Sit down , dearest . Let 's see what we have here . THEODOTE Let it alone ! PAUSANIAS Taking her by the armBe more courteous to outlanders . THEODOTE Striking him with her free handIt 's not for Spartans . PAUSANIAS Forcing her to sitA little service , please . He takes the food THEODOTE You 're horrible . PAUSANIAS I know . He sitsStupid , too , do n't you think ? p. 36 THEODOTE Yes , stupid . PAUSANIAS That 's what they all say . But I am the king of Sparta . THEODOTE The king of Sparta ! And I said you were stupid ! Oh , forgive me ! XANTIPPE crouches , listening SOCRATES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat talking with me through the whole of a summer night , about twenty-five years ago . Their names were Alcibiades , Charmides , and Critias , for you were one of the three . We talked of Athens and of the arts and of government and of the chances of this world . And we concluded  --  I think it was you , Critias , who summed up for us , and we were happy in what you said  --  we concluded that the most valuable thing a man or a state could have was freedom . We concluded that if a man or a state was to retain freedom three things were needed : power and incorruptibility and frugality  --  the art of wanting little for yourself . And the more frugal and honest you are the less power you need . CRITIAS Must we go back so far ? SOCRATES I had great hope for you three , and for Athens because of you . A democracy must have leaders and perhaps another Pericles might come from among you . You were very gay , and witty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support democracy whatever might come . We made up such an oath , and swore it , all four of us . The oath was to this effect : " I will kill with my own hand , if I am able , any man who subverts the democracy of Athens , or who shall hold any office in the city after the democracy has been destroyed , or shall rise in arms to make himself a despot , or shall help a despot to establish himself . And if anyone else slay such an enemy of our democracy I will account the slayer holy before the gods and give him friendship and love . " Do you remember this ? p. 37 CRITIAS I remember . Men do silly things when a little drunk . SOCRATES And when drunk with power  --  or the thirst for power . That was twenty-five years ago . Charmides is dead . He was among the first to plot the destruction of democracy , and he is dead . Alcibiades  --  you know his history . He set out to gain power at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most extravagant displays of games and horse racing and costly celebration in our city 's history . He took money , in vast quantity , from the king of Persia , promising Athens to him . He was banished , and set out to destroy the city that banished him . He was a brilliant statesman and general , and he betrayed every talent and every trust till he was universally hated  --  and at last his enemies caught up with him and he was killed . The history of Athens reeks with such men , brilliant and unscrupulous , committed to success at any price , serving on three sides of every cause  --  and they have not ended well . Themistocles , our greatest general , saved Athens from Persia , and then sold out to Persia  --  and died dishonored . In all our history there has never been a time when brilliant men have been lacking to betray our city and change coats for money  --  and die young . You are still young , Critias , and you , like the others , have sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie . I have not sold out . p. 38 SOCRATES Leon is guilty of no crime . You wish to kill him to consolidate your power and to confiscate his fortune . You have killed many because they were rich and fat and tempting prizes . You will die young . CRITIAS It is too late for you to die young , Socrates . SOCRATES Much too late . And I have no fortune . CRITIAS Satyros has plans for you . I have seen him look at your throat . SOCRATES The gods have plans for all of us . CRITIAS Satyros could be placated . SOCRATES But not the gods . CRITIAS You believe in the gods ? SOCRATES Yes , in all of them . And especially in the one that tells me not to sit on your court . CRITIAS takes a step toward Socrates to deliver some sort of ultimatum but is interrupted by the entrance of the rest of the labor gang . PHAEDO , CRITO , and CRASSOS come in with food in their hands ; ANYTAS sees Theodote and goes to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters with his thugs ANYTAS You brought food for me ? THEODOTE Yes , I did , Anytas , but our friend , the king of Sparta , was very hungry , and I knew you 'd want him to have it . p. 39 PAUSANIAS I 'm sorry , friend , but I was ravenous and a pretty girl came along with some good-looking fruits and vegetables  --  He goes on eatingand I have n't got the heart to give them back . ANYTAS You intend to finish the lot ? PAUSANIAS I do . ANYTAS To TheodoteHere 's a drachma ; bring me something . THEODOTE rises PAUSANIAS I 'm sorry , friend . She stays with me . ANYTAS I 'll get something for myself . He starts out . THEODOTE sits again SATYROS Be back before the sun crosses the wall . ANYTAS goes out without speaking . The newcomers settle themselves to eat CRITIAS Before the sun touches the west pillars of the Acropolis you will be at the Senate chamber , ready to join the other four judges . SOCRATES In the old days the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riddled with treachery and rivalry , and yet , compared with any other city a city of light  --  because it allowed men 's minds to be free . It is now a despotism , and you govern it , but you have it in your power to give us back our city of light . Remember the days of your youth , Critias , and give it back . Forget these murders that make you rich and this corruption of free men that keeps you in power  --  p. 40 CRITIAS Flashing outWhatever I believe you taught me ! What I do you taught me to do ! SOCRATES Indeed ? CRITIAS Did you not teach us to question our gods , our laws , our customs , and the very meaning of the words we used ? SOCRATES It was our way to question everything . CRITIAS And did we find anything sure ? SOCRATES Nothing sure , worse luck . CRITIAS Then why not murder , why not rob , why not take what you want where you find it ? There are no rules ! SOCRATES QuietlyBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not also question the value of murder , the value of blood money , the value of high office in the state illegally attained , before we destroy all we have to possess them ? CRITIAS To SatyrosStay with him . If he goes to the Senate do not touch him . If he goes to his home , or elsewhere , follow him and do the needful . SATYROS Yes , master . CRITIAS goes out SOCRATES To SatyrosWhy , it seems that we are to be well acquainted ; you are to be my constant companion . p. 41 SATYROS To the death , Socrates ! SOCRATES You hear that ? He has a sense of humor ! XANTIPPE goes to Socrates XANTIPPE What are you going to do ? SOCRATES I believe you have something to eat there in your hand . I shall begin with that . She gives him the packet and the jug XANTIPPE You could eat on the way . You must be at the Senate chamber before the sun reaches the west wall . SOCRATES I 'm thinking of writing a hymn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pun , and I love the sun so much , and a man should write down a little something before he dies , even if it 's bad . XANTIPPE You can write a hymn while you sit on his court . SOCRATES I 'm not going to the Senate . I shall go home . SATYROS I knew it would come ! I knew it ! XANTIPPE But this monster is waiting here to kill you ! SOCRATES Let him wait . A man must have his lunch . He eats PAUSANIAS Better do as you 're told , friend . p. 42 THEODOTE Yes , you must ! XANTIPPE Give me that food ! Go ! Go ! To the Senate ! She takes the food SOCRATES All my life I 've been saying it is better for a man to die than to do what his soul believes to be wrong . Shall I now do wrong to save my life ? PAUSANIAS He will have Leon killed anyway . XANTIPPE With you or without you he will do this murder ! You ca n't stop him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me my food . Xantippe . I 've been working since dawn . XANTIPPE gives him the food again , and sits with bowed head END OF SCENE p. 43 Act 1 , Scene 3 Act OneSCENE 3 SCENE : Socrates ' house about half an hour later . Lysis and Phoenix are seated at the table , the bread and the jug before them . PHOENIX Why ca n't I have any more ? LYSIS Because that 's what she said to give you ; just that much and not another crust . PHOENIX Where is she ? LYSIS She went to take food to father . There 's somebody coming now . The children get up and slip into a corner . SOCRATES comes in with XANTIPPE and followed by SATYROS and his thugs . PHOENIX runs to Xantippe XANTIPPE Are you all right ? PHOENIX Lysis wo n't give me any more . XANTIPPE I told him how much to give you . The rest 's for supper . SATYROS looks at the family scene and moves to a place where he can wait SOCRATES You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be happy to moisten my throat with a little wine and water  --  if the needful is to be postponed at all . SATYROS Have your drink . Pausanias wishes to watch this affair . p. 44 SOCRATES Maybe you 'll have a sup with me then ? SATYROS You would n't drink with me . I 'm a slave . And an executioner . SOCRATES You have scruples about drinking with me ? SATYROS No citizen drinks with a slave . SOCRATES Nonsense . Pour for both of us , Xantippe . And for yourself . XANTIPPE does soSit down . SATYROS It 's not right . SOCRATES You 'll get used to it . SATYROS Pausanias will find me at the table . SOCRATES He has no principles . Sit . SATYROS I 'll drink standing . SOCRATES You 're frightened . Well , you make many enemies . Perhaps you should be wary . XANTIPPE serves Socrates first , then Satyros SATYROS I 've never before drunk wine with a free citizen . SOCRATES How does it taste ? SATYROS Excellent . XANTIPPE Where 's Lamprocles ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went to Piraeus. p. 45 XANTIPPE Piraeus . LYSIS You see , there 's a rebellion starting against Critias at Piraeus . Meletos is leading it . Critobulus went  --  and Anytas , too . SOCRATES Anytas ? We just saw him . LYSIS Well , he went with the rebels . And he was mad . And a lot of them went . They were singing and swishing around with their swords and making a lot of noise . SOCRATES I should be there . XANTIPPE You ! At your age ! SOCRATES At any age . And so we 're to be honored by a visit from King Pausanias ? SATYROS I do n't know whether it 's an honor , but he 's coming here . He wants to see how a philosopher takes it . XANTIPPE Socrates ! SOCRATES Yes . XANTIPPE Kiss the children and I 'll take them away . SOCRATES Let 's not worry the children , Xantippe . They 'll have troubles soon enough . XANTIPPE But  --  look at them ! She points to Satyros and his men SOCRATES Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CRITIAS and PAUSANIAS enterAh , the whole power of the state is with us ! THEODOTE entersAnd it becomes a social occasion ! Sit , gentlemen , if you can find places . We 're not equipped for much company . p. 46 PAUSANIAS If I may make a suggestion ? SOCRATES Yes ? PAUSANIAS There is such a place as the women 's quarters , I 'm told , in Athenian houses . SOCRATES Yes , there is . PAUSANIAS If the women and children would enter those quarters  --  THEODOTE Oh , not I ! I 'm not supposed to enter the women 's apartment . I 'm only supposed to mix with men ! PAUSANIAS Stay here , then , but let the wife and children retire . XANTIPPE looks at Socrates , who smiles back calmly , then she grimly takes the children and goes CRITIAS I have many things to do , you know ! It 's unnecessary and irregular that I should be here . THEODOTE sits quietly in a corner PAUSANIAS You will remain till it 's over , my dear Critias . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a question I wished to ask this Socrates . You will answer ? SOCRATES As well as I can . PAUSANIAS You said something about some small divinity that clings to your ear and gives you advice . p. 47 SOCRATES Yes . PAUSANIAS Now , this is very interesting to me , because I 've got something like that , too . SOCRATES You have ? Well that 's very interesting to me . PAUSANIAS It 's like this . You have the kind of brain that cuts corners and goes in and out of ratholes like nothing . You 're quick and you can figure things out  --  only every once in a while this little demon of yours leans over and says to you , " Wait a minute . Not so fast . " SOCRATES He says something like that , yes . PAUSANIAS Now I 'm just the opposite . I 'm dull . You go in and out of that rathole in front of my eyes and I ca n't even see where you went . I ca n't figure anything out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to make decisions because people come screaming at me . And what do I do ? I wait . SOCRATES And somebody whispers in your ear ? PAUSANIAS No . Nobody whispers in my ear . No such luck . I just wait and let them scream . And if I wait long enough , and sleep on it , and maybe sleep on it two or three times , why I wake up some morning and there it is , plain as morning , what to do . SOCRATES Why , that 's wonderful ! p. 48 PAUSANIAS And I 'm stupid ! Dumb ! SOCRATES Just beyond words wonderful ! PAUSANIAS Is n't it ? CRITIAS Could we abbreviate these felicitations ? PAUSANIAS Is n't it wonderful ? SOCRATES Beyond description ! Enchanting ! PAUSANIAS Now take a case like this : Critias says Socrates is the worst enemy of the state and we must be rid of him at once . At once , mind you . Now that 's what I do n't like . Maybe we should get rid of you , but why all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surely . Why not ? PAUSANIAS If need be , why not sleep  --  well two or three nights on it ? SOCRATES Of course I 'm not a young man . If you wait too long I might die . PAUSANIAS Now you 're going round corners . Now you 're too fast for me . SOCRATES I wonder . PAUSANIAS Tell me , what is your little angel-demon whispering to you this afternoon ? SOCRATES Let me see . Something very strange . For the first time since I have known him he 's whispering a warning about somebody else  --  not about me at all . p. 49 PAUSANIAS A warning ? SOCRATES Just a warning that somebody is in danger . PAUSANIAS Not you ? SOCRATES Not me . PAUSANIAS Me ? SOCRATES Not you . PAUSANIAS Looking roundTheodote ? SOCRATES No . PAUSANIAS Your wife ? Your children ? SOCRATES No . PAUSANIAS Leon of Salamis ? SOCRATES No . PAUSANIAS I can tell you something about Leon of Salamis . He 's dead . Critias had him killed before he asked you to act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CRITIAS I am not here to be questioned . PAUSANIAS It 's true . SOCRATES This is most strange and disturbing . Critias , the warning I receive concerns you , and it 's so definite and immediate that I feel like urging you to run  --  run until you can surround yourself with heavy-armed troops and ward off what seems to be coming . p. 50 CRITIAS Thank you , I shall not run , and I am not especially entertained . We are here , or at least I came here , for a certain purpose , and my time is limited . You may have time to waste . Philosophers and kings are taken care of by other people , but every moment of my day is carefully planned , and this visit was not even listed . The king wished me to be present and I am present , but the business must be dispatched or I must leave . SOCRATES I am more and more puzzled by this , Critias , but truly you appear to be in danger here , and should leave quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners , Socrates , but you will not slip out of this one . Come . PAUSANIAS I 'd prefer a little more time  --  CRITIAS I know . You 'd prefer to wait till he dies of old age , as he suggests . But patient though I am I 'm not that patient . Come . He stands at the door , inviting them out PAUSANIAS You are ready ? SOCRATES As ready as I 'm likely to be . PAUSANIAS Let 's go then . SOCRATES Shall I precede you ? PAUSANIAS If you will . SOCRATES , PAUSANIAS , and then CRITIAS go out . SATYROS and his men follow as usual . THEODOTE rises and runs to the door , looking after them , then walks about the room ; finally gets up courage to go to the inner door p. 51 THEODOTE Xantippe ! Xantippe ! XANTIPPE At the doorwayWhat is it ? THEODOTE May I come in with you ? XANTIPPE Why ? THEODOTE They 've all gone out together . I do n't want to be alone . XANTIPPE Where have they gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside door , looks out , then comes backWhat are they doing ? XANTIPPE They 're walking away  --  the three of them  --  and Satyros is following with the executioners . THEODOTE May I come in with you ? XANTIPPE Yes , come in . She puts her arm around Theodote and the two women go together into the women 's quarters , Theodote sobbing . The stage is empty and silent for a moment , then a man 's cry is heard , quickly smothered . XANTIPPE returns , followed by THEODOTE . They stand near the inner door , looking at the outer one but not approaching it THEODOTE What can we do now ? XANTIPPE Nothing . There 's never anything a woman can do . p. 52 THEODOTE Will they bring him back ? XANTIPPE I do n't know . There 's nothing a woman can do . You or I or any of us now . I do n't care what he did . There was nobody like him . I do n't care if he did have his arms round you . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . There was nobody like him . THEODOTE Nobody . XANTIPPE He 's probably lying in the open street . They leave them that way sometimes , the brutes . Will you help me carry him in ? THEODOTE Yes , Xantippe . You were his wife . He loved you . XANTIPPE I do n't know who he loved , but let 's carry him in . THEODOTE throws her arms round Xintippe , who remains stolidCome , Theodote ; we can cry afterward . THEODOTE Still cryingI 'm such a fool ! XANTIPPE Well , who is n't ? We 're all fools . THEODOTE He he was n't . XANTIPPE I thought not at first . But he was . You were n't married to him . THEODOTE No . You 'd know . She controls herself p. 53 XANTIPPE Can we go now ? THEODOTE Yes . They turn toward the outer door , their minds made up . At this moment . PAUSANIAS comes in slowly and the women pause , looking at him . SOCRATES enters , looking back out the door . Xantippe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What has happened ? SOCRATES BewilderedI do n't know , my dear . The usual governmental inefficiency . They killed the wrong man . XANTIPPE They killed  --  what man ? SOCRATES Critias . They killed Critias . XANTIPPE Critias dead ? And you 're  --  not in danger ? SOCRATES No , Stupid here is my friend  --  so far , anyway . XANTIPPE We were about to go out and carry you in , I and this scented doxy of yours ! She moves violently away from TheodoteThat wo n't be necessary now ! SOCRATES No , I can walk . You do n't seem glad to see me . XANTIPPE I 'm just so used to tricks I do n't know what to think . SOCRATES Well , this was no trick . I 'm somewhat shaken . Critias did not make a handsome corpse . He did n't expect to die  --  and did n't intend to . He struggled . p. 54 PAUSANIAS May I sit down ? SOCRATES Oh , forgive me ! Please sit down . King Pausanias of Sparta ; my wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , I think . But if he knows any good of me that 's more than I can say for him . PAUSANIAS Thank you , lady . I 'll sit here . The truth is I had no intention of having him killed today but he forced my hand . SOCRATES His death was not a mistake ? PAUSANIAS No , no , quite regular . A little hurried . In fact he was pretty green for plucking , and could have gathered in several large and luscious plutocrats in the next few days . THEODOTE You did this to to save the plutocrats ? PAUSANIAS No . No , sweetheart . SOCRATES " Green for plucking , " you said . PAUSANIAS Yes . Not ripe . Not fully ripe . Not half as rich as he would have been a week from now . SOCRATES You intend to  --  profit by this assassination ? PAUSANIAS The kings of Sparta have sunk pretty low . The ephors are everything now . My family needs a fortune , preferably in gold . The old Spartan iron money is falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was counting on Critias to re-establish the family fortunes . He 'll still bring me quite a chunk . Leon of Salamis alone was worth near half a million . p. 55 SOCRATES Which you will receive ? PAUSANIAS Who else ? SOCRATES The families of the deceased men , I should think . PAUSANIAS Critias ' family ? SOCRATES No , the families of the men Critias killed and robbed . PAUSANIAS I shall never understand democracy . Critias stole the money . I stole it from Critias and have it . Shall I try to give it back to the men Critias stole it from ? How do I know who they stole it from ? Or who they stole from ? It 's an endless chain . Much simpler to keep it . SOCRATES Do you think that all money is stolen ? PAUSANIAS How else would anybody get it ? But before we go into that let me explain that the occupation is over and I am leaving Athens . Naturally I had to dispose of Critias before I went . SOCRATES Ah  --  you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupation is over . SOCRATES Now , we shall miss you , but this is not entirely bad news , you realize . We had been wondering if Sparta intended to police us indefinitely . PAUSANIAS My career is in Sparta , after all , and things are not going well for me down there in my absence . I have to get back quickly and begin to patch the holes in my political socks . The money will help a lot . I 'll put somebody in my place here and pull out . Do you have any suggestions ? p. 56 SOCRATES I do . Give us back our democracy . PAUSANIAS Your democracy ? Well , hardly ! Choose a man who can be trusted and I 'll set him up in power before I leave . SOCRATES No man can be trusted . PAUSANIAS Well , you have to trust somebody ! SOCRATES Nobody can be trusted with power . PAUSANIAS What do you trust ? SOCRATES The citizens  --  the voters . PAUSANIAS Look  --  democracy is an ugly and disorderly form of government . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they do what they please and say what they like and they actually charge a profit for supplying each other with the necessities of life ! SOCRATES Do you know a better kind of government ? PAUSANIAS The one we have in Sparta . SOCRATES I 've never traveled . What is it like ? PAUSANIAS Ah , there all men get the same wages and eat the same rations and  --  well , it 's like a great army , every man in it working for the common good . SOCRATES That sounds perfect ! p. 57 PAUSANIAS It is perfect . All property is in common , you see , and no man attempts to get ahead of the others , because he ca n't  --  and there 's no unseemly scramble for wealth and honors such as you have here . SOCRATES Then you 've invented paradise . PAUSANIAS I think we have . SOCRATES Who governs this paradise ? PAUSANIAS The ephors and the kings and the generals . SOCRATES These men are not elected , not chosen by the people ? PAUSANIAS No , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men take the whole burden of the government on themselves , so that the average citizen never has to worry about it at all . SOCRATES Why , this gets better and better . The governing class does the worrying for everybody ? PAUSANIAS Yes , all of it . SOCRATES But then it does all the burdensome thinking in every field ? PAUSANIAS Yes , true . SOCRATES And the ordinary man 's thoughts are rationed out to him just like his clothes and food ? PAUSANIAS Even so . p. 58 SOCRATES And the ephors and kings and generals are so conscientious and self-sacrificing that they live on the same plain rations that are given to the workmen and soldiers ? PAUSANIAS They usually have some property . SOCRATES Oh , they do not live on the same plain scale as the workmen ? PAUSANIAS No . They deserve more and naturally they receive more than the commoners . SOCRATES And how do they keep their places ? Is there sometimes violence among them , a murder now and then when property or power is concentrated unfairly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen . SOCRATES It happens rather often ? PAUSANIAS Rather often . SOCRATES Then what you have is a governing class of freebooters and murderers , holding the population down by terror and strict controls ? PAUSANIAS We do n't starve a man 's children because he has no money ! That 's brutal ! SOCRATES Murder is more merciful ? PAUSANIAS Far more ! It 's quick , neat , and practically painless . It 's the ideal death . Starvation , that 's slow torture ! Inhuman ! p. 59 SOCRATES Let us worry about that . Give us back our democracy ! PAUSANIAS If I had n't worried about you a little you 'd be lying out there in a ditch and Critias would still be walking around . SOCRATES Was that why you plucked him green ? PAUSANIAS It was . SOCRATES You lost money by murdering him too soon ? PAUSANIAS A pot of it . SOCRATES You 're not consistent , O King ! Why should you lose money to save my worthless neck ? PAUSANIAS That 's my weakness . I like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Going to PausaniasYou 're only pretending you 're a fool ! PAUSANIAS Woman , do you want to ruin me ? XANTIPPE Anyway , I do know something good about you . PAUSANIAS Well , that 's possible . SATYROS looks in at the doorGod , what an ugly mug ! What have you done with Critias ? SATYROS Laid him in his house . PAUSANIAS And where 's the money ? p. 60 SATYROS Abroad your trireme . PAUSANIAS How much ? SATYROS We thought it was safer not to count it . It 's loaded in the hold  --  in the original bags . A hundred and four of them , each marked " one talent . " PAUSANIAS Not what I hoped for , but it will do . And where are the occupation forces ? SATYROS They 've left the Acropolis . They 're marching toward the ships . PAUSANIAS You may go . SATYROS leavesOne thing further I must tell you , Socrates . I make it my business to know what people are thinking . I have to . If Athens goes back to being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be tried on that same old charge they nailed up against you once before . And if it comes to a vote you could be found guilty . So choose some honest , stupid man , with no more brain than I have , and in he shall go as despot here . And choose a friend of yours . You may need protection . SOCRATES I rather like you , Stupid . You have the endearing qualities of the frankly criminal class  --  but the courts are my protection . PAUSANIAS I 'm quite serious about it . Let me put a friend of yours in here , and let him do a little quiet looting for you , for if any trouble comes up the first thing a man needs is money . p. 61 SOCRATES I 've never needed money . PAUSANIAS Then you 've never been in trouble . XANTIPPE We 've always needed money . SOCRATES Not stolen money . XANTIPPE I would n't mind how we got it ! SOCRATES Stupid 's notion of quiet looting is to send some quiet experts to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from behind without outcry and take over their money and property . PAUSANIAS I do n't mind what you think about me , you know . I 'm just a stupid king , and it does n't matter what happens to me . But I 'm concerned about you . Look , who was the greatest statesman you ever had in Athens ? SOCRATES Pericles , probably . PAUSANIAS And who was his teacher ? SOCRATES Did he have a teacher , O Monarch ? PAUSANIAS You know , the one he studied philosophy and rhetoric and physics under . SOCRATES Anaxagoras ? PAUSANIAS That 's it , Annex  --  what's-his-name . Now this Annex was a famous teacher and he charged for his lessons and he had the protection of the head of the state but he made one mistake . He said in public that the sun was not a god but a ball of fire  --  and what happened to him ? p. 62 XANTIPPE He was exiled . Banished . By popular vote . PAUSANIAS Right . He had a choice between drinking hemlock and getting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another  --  agoras , not Annex  --  you must have known him . SOCRATES Protagoras . Yes , I knew him . PAUSANIAS What happened to him ? THEODOTE He wrote a treatise on the gods , saying he did n't know whether they existed or not , and he was exiled , and he should have been ! PAUSANIAS By popular vote ? XANTIPPE He was tried before a jury of five hundred and found guilty of irreligion . PAUSANIAS You seem to think I 'm pretty rough on the rich . Maybe I am , but Athens has been pretty rough on philosophers . I understand that you too have said a few things about the gods . SOCRATES And this worries you ! PAUSANIAS It worries me . SOCRATES You choose the strangest things to worry about . I 've spent my life talking . It 's possible that I 've said a few things on nearly every subject . PAUSANIAS What you said about the gods is remembered . It 's been repeated to me. p. 63 SOCRATES I make my sacrifices in the temple daily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows where he came from or what he should do while here or where he is going , and that he should search without rest for the answers to these questions  --  in books and at the altars of the gods and in his own mind . PAUSANIAS It wo n't do . They 'll have you up for it . SOCRATES I hope they do have me up for it . Nothing could be healthier than to bring the whole thing into the open , right out in the good sunlight before every man in Athens , with every possible charge leveled against me and full discussion of politics , gods , and men . PAUSANIAS They 'll get you , like they got those two agorasses  --  SOCRATES Not Athens , not my city of Athens ! PAUSANIAS Well , I have to go . I 'll have one of those bags of silver sent to your house . I wo n't miss it , and it 'll make you rich the rest of your life  --  SOCRATES Do n't send it . I do n't want it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it to the poor . p. 64 XANTIPPE Where will you find anybody poorer than we are ? PAUSANIAS We 're always on the same side , are n't we , Xantippe ? Well , farewell . THEODOTE takes his arm and they turn toward the door . CRITOBULUS rushes in not seeing Pausanias CRITO Socrates ! Critias has been killed ! SOCRATES We thought you had gone to Piraeus . CRITO Yes  --  we were all going to join the rebellion against Critias , but the news caught up with us and they 're all coming to Athens ! Critias is dead and the Spartans are retreating to their ships and there 's nobody between us and freedom except King Pausanias ! He 's hiding somewhere and we 're going to find him and kill him ! CRITO , LAMPROCLES , ANYTAS , CRASSOS , LYCON , and MELETOS enter behind Critobulus LAMPROCLES Father ! We 've won ! The revolution has won ! We 're going to search every house till we find Pausanias and kill him ! Come in , come in ! Groups of our army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! SOCRATES Why , yes , come in , all of you , and greetings  --  but I think it wo n't be necessary to kill King Pausanias . LYCON There 's the king ! He 's here ! He whips out his dagger and leaps at Pausanias , who has drawn his sword . SOCRATES stops Lycon p. 65 SOCRATES Gently , Lycon . LYCON Do you defend him ? Then this is for you ! He draws back his arm to strike but CRASSOS catches it CRASSOS Father  --  would you kill Socrates ? LYCON Yes , I would kill Socrates ! SOCRATES Taking the dagger from Lycon 's handThat also may be unnecessary , my dear Lycon . In fact , this entire revolution might be concluded without killing anybody . If we put our case to King Pausanias he could probably be persuaded to sheath his sword and re-establish Athenian democracy and go home . PAUSANIAS Do you still wish democracy re-established in Athens ? SOCRATES Of course I do ! PAUSANIAS The old charge will be brought up against you . You will go on trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in open court , Pausanias . It 's our way of achieving justice under our peculiar system . PAUSANIAS In my opinion you are unlikely to receive justice . SOCRATES I shall accept whatever verdict the jury reaches . p. 66 PAUSANIAS Very well ! Do n't say I did n't warn you ! He turns to the crowdSo you think you have a revolution here ? You 're welcome to it ! You 're welcome to this pesthole and your methods of running it . Put up your blades and I 'll cover mine . One , two , three . Nobody movesListen , I 'll count three again , and this time if you do n't put away those knives some people are going to die here  --  and I wo n't be the first . One , two , three . Swords and daggers are sheathed simultaneouslyIt 's a pleasure . Never fight unless you have to . SOCRATES Now I suggest that we form a guard of honor and conduct the king to the Senate , where he will formally surrender possession of the city into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He 's our prisoner . MELETOS He 's our prisoner and he 's under guard ! SOCRATES It 's hard to tell the difference between a police guard and guard of honor . But let 's escort him . Otherwise some hothead might murder him before he goes through the ceremony . CRITO That 's very true . We 'll form an escort . Lead the way , Meletos . The men go out , escorting the king . XANTIPPE looks at Theodote p. 67 XANTIPPE Are you going south with the king ? THEODOTE He 's forgotten about me . She sits XANTIPPE We 're both forgotten . THEODOTE You 're a wife . Yours will come back . XANTIPPE Out of habit , perhaps . She sits THEODOTE It 's better than trying to be seductive every day . I do n't feel seductive every day . XANTIPPE Theodote ? THEODOTE Yes , Xantippe . XANTIPPE Sometimes when I 'm near you I smell one perfume , sometimes another , and sometimes a mingling of perfumes . Why is that ? THEODOTE I use more than one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it ? THEODOTE They 're mad about perfumes . They go sniffing and snuffing and hunting and getting more and more excited till She pauses XANTIPPE What kinds do you use ? You do n't mind telling me ? THEODOTE Of course not . Palm oil on the face and breast , marjoram on the eyebrows and hair , oil of thyme on the ears and knees , mint on the arms , myrrh on the legs and feet . And on the thighs  --  p. 68 XANTIPPE Yes ? THEODOTE I have my own preparation for the thighs . I could lend you some . XANTIPPE What was there between you and Socrates ? THEODOTE Not much . Something . Long ago . But it was Alcibiades I loved . And he 's dead . Sometimes I like to see Socrates because he was Alcibiades ' friend . Do you mind ? XANTIPPE No . Marjoram on the hair , thyme on the throat and knees ? THEODOTE Yes . XANTIPPE Am I a fool to be in love when I 'm old ? THEODOTE What better is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looks out the door@@ SCENE : The house of Socrates a few days or weeks later . Socrates , Xantippe , Lamprocles , and Phoenix are seated at the breakfast table . LYSIS runs in to join them . LYSIS I 'm sorry I 'm late ! We were running races and  --  oh ! He leaps up , combing his fingers through his hair XANTIPPE What is it now ? LYSIS I came through the bushes and I must have got some kind of bug in my hair . There it is  --  on the table . LAMPROCLES It looks like a tick . Shall I kill it ? XANTIPPE Not on the table , please ! LAMPROCLES Well , do n't let it get away . It does look like a tick . LYSIS I 'm watching it . It ca n't get away . The boys follow its progress across the table , fascinated LAMPROCLES It 's got a small head . He touches itAnd a hard shell . LYSIS It could be just a plain harmless little beetle . PHOENIX Shall I crunch him ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't we give him a fair trial ? If he 's a tick , kill him . If he 's a plain harmless little beetle let him off . That 's the Athenian way . XANTIPPE I wish you would n't joke about trials . SOCRATES Why not , Xantippe ? A fair trial for the accused is the heart of our political system . A man is n't guilty till he 's found guilty . And neither is a bug . XANTIPPE But why must they try you now ? There 's plenty to do just to re-establish the democracy and clean up after the way things were under the Thirty ! Why do n't they just do that ? SOCRATES I do n't know , Xantippe , but I do know that history does n't come at us the way it should . It comes at us any old way , higgledy-piggledy , and every day when you look at it it looks like a mess . The next day a new mess is poured on top of the old mess , and nothing is ever cleaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so underneath it 's a petrified mess and on top it 's a fresh mess and it goes on that way forever . LAMPROCLES I maintain that this is not a six-legged fellow at all , but an eight-legger ! Ticks have eight legs and no wings ! It 's a tick ! LYSIS I maintain that he 's a warmhearted and gentle little beetle , with six legs and nothing to bite with ! p. 71 PHOENIX It 's a six-legger ! I counted them ! LYSIS Innocent ! Not a tick ! LAMPROCLES All right , I do n't accuse it of being a tick ! I accuse it of being a female Athenian under thirty and guilty of violating the sumptuary law governing the rules of dress ! It is not wearing its chiton in such fashion as to expose one leg as far as the thigh . The boys lean over to examine the bug closely XANTIPPE Is there truly such a law ? SOCRATES There is . There have been too many unmarried girls and too many bachelors since the war ended . Maybe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So three days ago this statute became effective , and every girl on the street slips along with one leg twinkling . LYSIS Oh , oh . It 's gone . They look for the bug unsuccessfully PHOENIX It was n't guilty anyway . It was showing all six legs . Up to its bottom . XANTIPPE Is there no law against showing too much ? LAMPROCLES Yes , there is , but that 's an old law . Nobody bothers about that . It 's this new law that 's causing all the excitement . p. 72 SOCRATES What kind of excitement ? LAMPROCLES Oh , soldiers whistling and calling out after girls , and girls pulling at their clothes and blushing and hurrying by . SOCRATES Here 's somebody who can tell us about it . Come in , Theodote . What 's the mood of the streets ? THEODOTE enters THEODOTE Greetings ! Greetings to the table and the house ! You should see the streets ! Perhaps the girls were a little bashful at first , but today you should see them ! Every vendable maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , her best leg foremost . Those with good legs show a good deal , those with so-so legs show a misleading trace , those with bad legs have found ways of draping the material so that a man might think if she brings a little money these legs are not so bad . XANTIPPE And the men ? THEODOTE Oh , the men walk up and down and gape as if such wonders had never been seen ! Girls are going like hot cakes . There have never been so many troths plighted in a morning since legs were first invented . XANTIPPE This has destroyed your business , no doubt ? . THEODOTE Oh , no  --  licit and illicit business have improved together ! p. 73 XANTIPPE Theodote ! THEODOTE Yes , my dear Xantippe . XANTIPPE You too are wearing this open dress prescribed by law . THEODOTE Of course . She exhibits her drapery XANTIPPE But the law applies to maids under thirty ! THEODOTE Every single woman is a maiden , naturally . And what woman is over thirty ? XANTIPPE I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I 'm not here to talk about this . King Pausanias is coming to Athens . XANTIPPE For the trial ? THEODOTE No , he 's coming to see me . LAMPROCLES The king of Sparta ? THEODOTE I know it 's incredible , but listen . This morning a messenger arrived at my house and asked for Theodote . I said that I was Theodote . He said that he brought a message for me from the king of Sparta . I asked to see it and he said that the king of Sparta did not write . He then delivered himself thus : " The king sends greetings to Theodote and wishes her to know that the rations of Sparta are tasteless after the viands of Athens . The king will see Theodote soon and she will prepare herself for a journey . " End quote . p. 74 XANTIPPE You 're to return to Sparta with him ! THEODOTE It can mean nothing else . LAMPROCLES Does this happen to kings , too ? SOCRATES Oh , when the bright stroke falls it can blind kings like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend at court . THEODOTE While I 'm there . I do n't expect it to last forever . He has a wife for official purposes . I 'm a half-breed and strictly unofficial . LYSIS Will you live in a palace ? THEODOTE Some part of a palace , I suppose . Or maybe one wing of a palace . LYSIS And will you have servants ? THEODOTE Countless servants . All Lacedemon will rush to help me into my chariot . There will be great bronze mirrors and barrels of oil and hogsheads of beauty creams . XANTIPPE You 're to be the companion of a king and have everything . She looks round her roomI hate you . THEODOTE You shall have your old Silenus all to yourself . XANTIPPE I 've never had anything . I hate you . SOCRATES Why , Xantippe , do you envy Theodote ? p. 75 XANTIPPE Yes , I do ! SOCRATES But what have we ever needed that we have n't had ? XANTIPPE Riches ! Great riches ! SOCRATES My dear wife , you 're speaking out in quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riches ? XANTIPPE All right , I 'll speak out in a new way , and for once I 'll say what I think ! Everybody goes around praising temperance and moderation and poverty and all that nonsense ! You go around praising them  --  you most of all ! And nobody wants them  --  nobody ! What people want is luxuries , and loads of money , and loads of everything , and people waiting on them  --  and that 's what I want ! You 're always looking for the honest truth and there it is ! People do n't want to be poor . They want to have everything , and so do I ! SOCRATES Of course , not everybody can have everything . XANTIPPE Of course not ! Let them do without . I 've done without long enough ! Let other people try it . How many do you know that are n't trying to get rich or stay rich or climb out of the hole they 're in ? I only know one , and that 's you ! One man in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens to be my priceless luck to be married to that one man . SOCRATES You say it well , Xantippe . I have never heard such a clear and passionate statement of the position . The only trouble is that you do n't mean it p. 76 XANTIPPE Do n't mean it ? SOCRATES If you had Theodote 's chance you would n't take it . XANTIPPE When offered servants and a palace ? SOCRATES You would think the matter over for a few days and in the end you would decide to remain here and eke out an existence on the same three obols a day  --  XANTIPPE That 's what you would do ! SOCRATES Think how we 'd waste those three obols if you were n't here . XANTIPPE A bit shakenThe spending of the money I 'd turn over to Lysis . He has some sense  --  THEODOTE And so far you have n't received any offers . XANTIPPE True . And I wo n't . LAMPROCLES We have visitors . He goes to usher in Phaedo and Crito SOCRATES Crito ! Phaedo ! Come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . XANTIPPE Poverty wins , of course . CRITO We looked for you at the banker 's tables , but you were n't there , so  --  PHAEDO We wanted to talk over some preparations for the trial  --  nothing difficult  --  just things that have to be done . p. 77 CRITO And since it 's not far off  --  the trial , I mean  --  they should be seen to while there 's time . XANTIPPE Boys , we 're in the way . CRITO No , you 're not , Xantippe . It 's usual in trials that involve the death penalty that the wife and children of the defendant appear with him and ask for clemency . We must arrange where you will stand and when you will approach the judges ' seats . THEODOTE I 'm not needed here , I think . PHAEDO No , only the family . THEODOTE I 'll join the parade of calves and men . She goes out PHOENIX Are we to go to the trial ? LYSIS It looks that way . CRITO Since there are no places reserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take Xantippe and the boys with us . And there 'd be some prearranged signal for them to come forward . Would this suit you , Xantippe ? XANTIPPE Whatever you say . PHAEDO The trial 's to begin in the morning and it may last some time , so we 'll bring something to eat and drink . XANTIPPE I 'll get the boys ready early . We 'll have to wear what we have on . There 's nothing else . p. 78 PHAEDO All the better . It 's well to give the impression that you are not well to do . XANTIPPE We can give that impression . CRITO It 's usual , even , to borrow tattered cloaks for the whole family and rehearse a scene of weeping which you will play out at the trial  --  before the magistrates and the jurors . SOCRATES This we ca n't do , Crito . CRITO Have you ever attended a serious trial where it was not done ? SOCRATES No . CRITO When you come into a court you have to do what is customary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not paying them due respect , and they resent it . SOCRATES If it were customary to bribe the jurors would you expect me to do that , too ? CRITO Socrates , if bribery were customary you would have to do that , too . Luckily you 're spared that . PHAEDO There 's one other matter that has to be attended to , and that 's the preparation of the defense . There 's a rhetorician , Zephyros , who has conducted thirty-four cases before the great court in the past two years and has not lost one case . Now , we do n't want anything to go wrong , Socrates . It 's so easy to make a legal slip and deliver yourself over to your enemies . Let us bring Zephyros into this , at least for consultation . He 'd be willing to do that for you . p. 79 SOCRATES If we need the children we 'll call you , Xantippe . XANTIPPE Yes . XANTIPPE and the three boys go out SOCRATES Phaedo , Crito , we have attended many trials together where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but written by a rhetorician  --  and we have watched the weeping of families , too , rehearsed and staged to move the hearts of the jurors . In most cases the men were acquitted when these things were well carried out . But unless I 'm mistaken there 's always some sly perversion of the truth in a professional defense , even if it were not a slight misrepresentation , though accepted , that one man should write words for another . And when it comes to the public grieving of the accused man 's family , that 's really an attempt to corrupt the court . For the jurors should judge him according to the evidence and with no thought of his family . CRITO But the vote may go against you if you fail to make these traditional gestures . SOCRATES Would you think better of me or worse of me if I allowed Xantippe and my sons to wail for me on a public platform ? CRITO It 's the jury I 'm worried about , not me . SOCRATES But it 's you I 'm worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of my friends  --  and myself . Would my friends and I think better of me or worse for these tricks ? Answer truthfully. p. 80 CRITO Not better . And still I think you should use them . SOCRATES Not better  --  worse . And that answers you . PHAEDO But this trial is serious , Socrates . SOCRATES What could be more serious than how well my friends think of me ? Nothing , I should say . CRITO When you speak in public you probe into things  --  and that 's exactly what Anytas and the others accuse you of  --  and you 're very likely to give a demonstration that will convince the jury of your guilt . XANTIPPE comes to the inner door and listens SOCRATES You see , Crito , I am accused of being the kind of man who corrupts and falsifies and distorts and destroys . Now if I am that kind of man I should be put out of the way . But how can the jury tell what kind of man I am if I go before them speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and children ? Do you think they are likely to think me guilty if they see me as I am ? CRITO Not likely to think you guilty , but likely to find you guilty . And I myself , Socrates , am not sure why you refuse to take advantage of these devices all men use . You 're involved here in a matter of life and death . Is n't it a little pretentious of you to say : " I 'll do it my own way and they 'll have to take me as I am " ? p. 81 SOCRATES Pretentious ? Now what does it pretend to ? There are some customs in our courts which make me uncomfortable when other men use them . If I tried to use them they 'd make me so uncomfortable that I could n't go on . I just do n't want to be uncomfortable . PHAEDO There are things even less comfortable . SOCRATES Are there ? Maybe we 're not being quite honest on either side . You 're concerned about me , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from my own bullheadedness  --  but it ca n't be done . It ca n't be done because I look forward to this trial as an athlete looks forward to the race he has longed for , as a wrestler looks forward to the bout for which all his life has been a training . All my life I 've been accused of things and I 've never been able to answer back . Day after tomorrow is my day ! Let another man write the words I 'm to say ? Never ! It 's my day ! And I go toward it with a very light heart , Crito . I do n't know why Anytas and Meletos insist on pressing that old indictment against me , but whatever their motives they could n't have pleased me more . CRITO You will speak extempore , as you always speak ? SOCRATES Offhand , as always . CRITO And you expect to succeed ? SOCRATES Mind you , I know , at my age , how dusty success is . And yet there 's a kind of dew on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dew over it  --  and I shall walk through it and revel in it . Do n't be angry with me. p. 82 CRITO No , but I must go . PHAEDO And I must . CRITO And I see that you must do it your own way . SOCRATES No question . But I do thank you . Remain my friends . PHAEDO No question of that . CRITO None . And we 'll see you ? SOCRATES I 'd go with you only there was something I wanted to do at home first . He looks round him I 'll remember it in a moment . CRITO At the market , then . SOCRATES At the market . CRITO and PHAEDO go out . SOCRATES follows them to the door , then turns and looks about , trying to remember . His eye falls on XantippeYes , of course . That 's what it was . XANTIPPE I wanted to tell you  --  I think you 're wrong  --  I think one might just as well give up and have things like the rest of the world . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do . Every once in a while I go a little mad on the subject of wanting things  --  because I 've never had them , and I 've always worked , and SOCRATES In all history there 's never been a husband so trying to the nerves of a wife . p. 83 XANTIPPE In all history there 's never been a wife so violent and disagreeable . Of course , I 've had good reason most of the time . SOCRATES I think you have . XANTIPPE But  --  SOCRATES Yes ? XANTIPPE Do n't hate me . SOCRATES Whatever gave you that idea ? XANTIPPE Do you know that it 's  --  it 's a long time since you 've put your arms round me ? SOCRATES Is it ? XANTIPPE Yes . SOCRATES I remember that when I was young I worked something out in my mind about people in love . It seemed to me that people making love were always getting into ridiculous positions  --  and yet they did get into them , and they did n't mind it  --  and the reason was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you also have the excuse that the whole ridiculous business is necessary because without it there 'd be no children . But when you get old your passions  --  you have them but they 're not so violent  --  and you do n't have that excuse of possible children . Maybe this gets in my way a little . XANTIPPE It gets in my way , too . p. 84 SOCRATES So  --  what do we do ? XANTIPPE When I go to the trial I want to watch you and remember that you love me a little . SOCRATES You can do that easily , Xantippe . Our sons will sit with you . XANTIPPE Would you , before the trial , lie with your head in my lap the way you did long ago  --  and I 'll sit and look into the distance and think of what it was all like then ? SOCRATES Yes . Of course it 's morning . XANTIPPE Tonight will do as well . SOCRATES But why not in the morning ? Sometimes it 's good to break precedents XANTIPPE I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but sit and let 's try how it is . She sits . He lies with his head in her lap . She looks into the distance and strokes his hairBy the dog , I almost feel young ! When did you take to wearing perfumes ? XANTIPPE Only lately . Do you like it ? SOCRATES Yes , I rather like it . Do you know what I have a mind to do ? XANTIPPE No . SOCRATES I have a mind to say a prayer . p. 85 XANTIPPE You used to say a prayer to the god Pan when you lay thus long ago . SOCRATES Will the children come back ? XANTIPPE No , I saw to that . SOCRATES Beloved Pan , and all you other gods who haunt this city , give me beauty in the inward soul , for outward beauty I 'm not likely to have . May I reckon the wise to be the wealthy and those who need least to be most like the gods . XANTIPPE It 's the same old prayer . SOCRATES ContinuingMake me content with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I get , love more than I hate , and think more of living than of having lived . Anything more ? This prayer , I think , is enough for me . She continues to stroke his hair , looking into the distance END OF SCENE p. 86 Act 2 , Scene 2 Act TwoSCENE 2 SCENE : We are in the middle of the trial . The audience in the theater is now the jury of five hundred and Anytas is concluding his speech to them . On the stage a magistrate sits listening , ready to make rulings . Socrates sits near him , and , on the other side , Meletos . Xantippe and the three sons are near the judge but not among the speakers . Theodote and King Pausanias are seen , but not part of the trial itself . Crito and Phaedo are somewhere visible . ANYTAS We have accused Socrates on three counts . First , he teaches a new religion , with gods of his own devising , and casts out the old gods of Greece from his atheistic temple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , and has no belief , and is not even sure that the earth is here and men are walking on it . Second , he corrupts the young men of our city by cynically questioning all the precepts and patterns of conduct by which we have lived since the time of Solon . Third , by some fatality which can not be chance , all the greatest enemies of Athens , those who have done her the most damage by means of treason , ill counsel , and demagoguery , have been his pupils and friends . He has taken no part in our politics but they have . We are a beggar city now , disarmed , punished by the gods for disbelief , disbelief that had its origin in , and spread out from , the brain of one man . We ask for the death of this man . As you know , he has the right to question us on all these points during the trial , and no doubt he will , for questioning is what he likes best . Of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuasive . Beware of him . Do n't let him trick you or make the worse appear the better cause , for that is his vocation and he has done it all too well . He does it so well , and has done it so well for forty years , that he has dragged our city down with him into the compost heap of his own thought . We leave the verdict to you . He sits p. 87 MAGISTRATE Socrates will now speak in his own defense . SOCRATES Rising , taking his placeMen of Athens , if Anytas wished to be believed he should never have said that I 'm an orator , for you 'll soon discover that I 'm not . I 'm afraid you 'll hear from me only the first plain words that come to hand . I 'm not used to speaking from a platform and I 've never before been in a lawsuit . I 'm a stranger to the language of this place . I shall have to speak as I have always spoken in the streets . Now I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask that I be put to death . They may be right , but let me tell you how I became the kind of fellow I am . My father was a sculptor  --  no , he was a stonecutter , and I took the same trade and I was a stonecutter . There are some marbles in the sanctuary of the Parthenon that I remember working on . But I had what was known as a shrewd wit  --  a workman 's wit  --  and it was my habit to talk while I chiseled the stone . I talked and cracked about politics and public affairs and statesmen and kept the whole workroom in good humor . After a while people began to drift into the factory to listen to me , and the crowds around my bench were large enough to become a nuisance . The day arrived when I had to stop talking or quit work , and so I moved my conversations into the street . By this time I was nearly forty years of age , and married , and my wife brought me a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day  --  and talking to the men in the streets became my work . And what did I talk about ? Well , I 'm afraid I was just a joker at first , because it amused people , but I sometimes joked about important men and questions , as we all do  --  and it happened after a while that I met some of these important men . Now I was only an irresponsible ignoramus , but I began to find that I knew as much about many things as the important people did . And I began to question them and stick needles in them  --  and sometimes I showed them up as ignoramuses  --  and they were angry . And I invented a sort of question-and-answer game for getting people into corners , and my following grew larger , because there 's nothing people like better than seeing public men confused and unable to answer . I was just as unable to answer as they were , but I was asking the questions , not answering them , and so I acquired a reputation for wisdom which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next thing that happened , though , seemed to me very serious . A friend of mine , now dead , a man well known to many of you , named Chairephon , went to Delphi and had the audacity to ask the oracle if there were any wiser man than Socrates . And the priestess answered no . This was heard by many citizens and when the news came to me I was stunned , for I had never pretended to wisdom and still do n't . Yet I could n't help taking the matter seriously and I asked myself , " What can the god mean ? " For a long while I was at a loss , but then I decided to continue my question-and-answer game , testing every man I met till I found somebody wiser than myself . And that search has gone on from that day to this , making me many enemies , no doubt , among those who were stumped by my questions , and getting me just about nowhere . I have not found one man who knows what holiness is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I still do n't know . I have put in a lifetime of Herculean labor to prove the god wrong , and I have not proved him either wrong or right . p. 88 MELETOS Do you deny that you questioned the existence of the gods ? MAGISTRATE Let us be orderly , Meletos ! SOCRATES To the judgeThis I can answer now , sir . Meletos , I am nearly seventy years old . In the course of the last thirty or forty years I have asked questions on nearly every subject . By the dog , I have not spared anything or anybody , myself included , and if matters of religion ever came up for discussion I pursued my usual course . It has been my fixed principle that the uncovering of truth could do no harm . I have believed that questioning could injure only what is false among workmen , businessmen , Sophists , statesmen or gods . The air of a democracy is only healthy when inquiry bites constantly at the heels of every proposal and every project , even at the foundations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and you have destroyed them ! SOCRATES May I ask you a question , Meletos ? MELETOS No . SOCRATES Will the magistrate instruct Meletos to answer ? MAGISTRATE You must answer him , Meletos . MELETOS Very well . SOCRATES Do you believe the truth can do harm ? p. 89 MELETOS No . SOCRATES Do you believe free discussion can do harm ? MELETOS No . SOCRATES Then you would oppose censorship ? MELETOS I would . SOCRATES But I am a citizen of Athens . Would you impose censorship on me ? MELETOS I would . On you alone . SOCRATES But if there were another man like me you would apply it to him ? MELETOS Yes , I would ! SOCRATES And if there were twenty like us you would apply it to all twenty ? MELETOS Yes , I would ! SOCRATES And if I had pupils who spoke like me you would apply it to them ? MELETOS Yes ! SOCRATES Do you put any limit on the number you would censor if they agreed with me ? MELETOS No ! SOCRATES But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now you say you would enforce it ! MELETOS I would enforce censorship on people like you ! p. 90 SOCRATES What kind of people would that be , Meletos ? MELETOS People who do n't believe in the gods ! You do n't believe in them . You 've sometimes been heard praying or sacrificing to demigods or to the god Pan or to your own private demon , but the central gods of Athens you never mention ! SOCRATES But I do believe in demigods ? MELETOS You 've been heard praying to them ! SOCRATES Meletos , it is known that mules are the offspring of horses and asses . Could a man believe in mules without believing that horses and asses exist ? MELETOS Hardly . SOCRATES It is also known that demigods are the offspring of gods and mortals . Could a man believe in demigods without believing that the gods exist ? ANYTAS There ! You hear it ! You all hear it ! He compares the mating of gods and mortals to the mating of horses and donkeys . And he compares demigods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anytas ? ANYTAS I see an impious man before me , and that 's what we came to prove . SOCRATES Tell me , Anytas , do the words in our language have definite meanings , or do the meanings shift about ? p. 91 ANYTAS They have definite meanings , you will find ! SOCRATES Do you know the meanings of our words ? ANYTAS I do ! SOCRATES Of all our words ? ANYTAS I think so . SOCRATES What a fortunate man ! Here I have been trying all these years to find the meaning of three or four , and they constantly elude me . But then you know the meaning of the words in the indictment you have signed against me ? ANYTAS I do , indeed . SOCRATES What is the meaning of the word impious ? ANYTAS To the judgeMust we go through this rigmarole ? MAGISTRATE You must answer . It is the law . ANYTAS Impious means not serving the gods , not believing in them . SOCRATES And what does pious mean  --  pious , I believe , being the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believing in them . SOCRATES Does it mean both these things ? ANYTAS It means both these things ! He turns away in disgust p. 92 SOCRATES Please follow me closely , Anytas , and do n't despise these questions , for they truly have a reason . If to be pious is both to believe in the gods and to serve them , is it possible for one man to believe in the gods but not serve them and for another man to serve them without believing in them ? ANYTAS This is an asinine question ! SOCRATES But is it possible ? ANYTAS It is possible , yes . SOCRATES Now if one man served the gods without knowing much about them , while another man knew them very well but failed to serve them , which would deserve punishment ? ANYTAS Must I answer this silliness , too ? MAGISTRATE Yes . SOCRATES Is not he who serves the gods the more righteous man ? ANYTAS Perhaps . SOCRATES Not perhaps , Anytas . What is your honest opinion ? One believes in the gods but does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Which should be punished . A pause MELETOS He who believes in the gods but does not serve them is the guilty man ! p. 93 SOCRATES Thank you , Meletos . And he is the more guilty , is he not , because he has great faith in them and still does not do their bidding ? MELETOS He is . SOCRATES But now a difficulty arises . Has anyone among us been told face to face by the gods what they wish him to do ? MELETOS No . SOCRATES And the rules for living laid down by the gods are rather general , are they not , so that a man must consider them carefully and weigh them well before he can be sure that his actions are such as the gods would approve ? Meletos is silent You do n't agree ? MELETOS No . SOCRATES But you considered carefully before you brought this action against me ? MELETOS Yes . SOCRATES Did you consult an oracle or receive any sign from the gods ? Any of you three . MELETOS No . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Athens , I am a man of doubt , as my accusers have said . All my wisdom is in knowing how little I know . None of my questions has been answered , none of the definitions I sought has been found . We live our lives , it seems to me , in such mystery and darkness that I was quick to take the one hint I thought might have come my way from a god , the answer made by the Delphic Apollo to a question about myself . Since that answer I have continued to seek , sometimes gaily , sometimes ironically , but always seriously , for somebody wiser than I am . Perhaps I was wrong , but this is the closest I have ever come to hearing a mandate from any god , and I wished to do as the god directed . You see before you then , a man who is not sure of his faith but has tried hard to serve Apollo , and in his accusers you see men of complete faith who have not heard even a hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . By Meletos ' own admission these men are more guilty than I. p. 94 ANYTAS But not by my admission ! MELETOS And not by mine ! ANYTAS Yes , you did admit it , you addlehead , and I warned you to be quiet  --  MELETOS Oh , you warned me ! MAGISTRATE Gentlemen , you will address the jury and not each other . SOCRATES Yes , gentlemen . I would not wish you to lose this case unfairly , and if you squabble among yourselves  --  ANYTAS Then answer this one fair question . Do you believe in the gods ? SOCRATES Of course I do , Anytas . ANYTAS In all of them , or only some ? SOCRATES In all of them , and many more than you do . ANYTAS Gods of your own , no doubt ? SOCRATES No , no , gods of your own , Anytas . I believe in every god you have in mind , and in the gods as they seem in the mind of Meletos , and in the gods as Homer imagined them  --  ANYTAS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind exactly like the mind of Meletos ? ANYTAS No , thank Zeus , it is not ! p. 95 SOCRATES Then the gods he conceives will be everywhere a little different from the gods of your thinking  --  ANYTAS I am not asking about the gods that are in anybody 's mind . I am asking about the gods as they are on Mount Olympos ! SOCRATES From whom did you learn about the gods on Olympos ? ANYTAS From Homer , atheist ! SOCRATES And from whom did Homer learn about them ? ANYTAS From whom  --  Men of Athens , you hear him ! He asks where Homer learned about the gods ! SOCRATES But that 's a very natural question , friend Anytas . Homer was a poet , and he wrote gloriously , as only a great poet can write . But were not the gods he wrote about the gods as he imagined them ? And when he heard about them from others were they not somewhat different ? Does not a great poet transmute what comes to him as bare fact and shadowy legend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe the gods of Olympos to be sure and solid and real ? SOCRATES As sure and solid and real as anything in this world ! Anytas pauses . MELETOS leaps up , speaks to Anytas p. 96 MELETOS And that stops you , I think ! To SocratesOnly how sure and real is this world ? SOCRATES Yes , how sure is it , Meletos ? How sure are you that you are there questioning me ? How sure are you that I am here replying ? I have often wondered . I think the gods are just as real as we are , Meletos . Is n't that real enough ? MELETOS Answer me ! I ask it again . How real is this world ? SOCRATES Of different degrees of reality , Meletos . Sometimes it seems to me that the gods in the pages of Homer are vividly alive , and that by comparison they are shadowy and indistinct on Mount Olympos . Sometimes it seems to me that your figure and mine , speaking here , are shadowy and indistinct , and will be quickly forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written down , say by young Plato there , who is always writing things down , may come vividly alive and remain so for a long time . Which then would be the more real , Meletos , the vivid scene written down or the shadowy one that actually takes place and then drifts away from men 's minds and is lost ? Socrates pauses . Meletos pauses ANYTAS To MeletosAnd now I hope you 're satisfied , now that he 's sunk us all together in this bog of reality and unreality  --  p. 97 MELETOS You did n't do so well with him , either ! ANYTAS Why must you leap in and interrupt ? SOCRATES It 's the business of the young to interrupt their elders , Anytas . You and I are not so young any more , and we must expect to be interrupted from now on . ANYTAS and MELETOS start to walk away in opposite directions . LYCON Comes forward MAGISTRATE Who will continue with the prosecution ? ANYTAS I will , if Meletos will be quiet ! MELETOS I will , if Anytas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say nothing than for you to talk ! MELETOS Then we say nothing ! MAGISTRATE Lycon , will you continue ? LYCON I had hoped to remain in the background , sir , but now I have no choice . Citizens of Athens , you see what happens when you deal with this jester on his own terms . I shall not fall into that error . I have one plain point to make . Since the beginning of the Peloponnesian War our city has been led by the pupils of Socrates . Alcibiades was the evil spirit of Athens for twenty years , guiding us from one calamity to another . Socrates was his teacher ! Charmides led the rebellion that overthrew our democracy and set up the unscrupulous Thirty . Socrates was his teacher ! Critias completed the wreck of Athens which the other two had begun . Socrates was his teacher ! Socrates taught all three a devilish ingenuity in logic which worked on men like a magic and led them to destroy themselves . These three were his chief followers , but there has been a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a volcano of corrupting fire and ash and lava , destroying our lives , our state , and our beliefs . And here he stands still  --  this monster who has let loose all these evils on us ! Here he stands , in his hypocritical poverty , playing with words , pretending that he meant only good . He has brought death to so many of our young warriors that the cemeteries of our city have doubled in size in his lifetime . And he meant well ! Oh , my brothers ! Oh , the dead children of the long war  --  this man meant well ! p. 98 SOCRATES Does it escape you , Lycon , that you have not shown a connection between my words and these disasters ? LYCON Yet there is a connection , Socrates ! There is a connection , citizens . To SocratesThis little question-and-answer game which you play at the bidding of Apollo , this game is not so harmless as you pretend . It 's a murderous weapon , this little game ! You point it at patriotism and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he begins to wonder why he should fight for his country . You turn it on morals and the robber begins to look like the honest man . You turn it on the gods and suddenly the gods are puppets that some fool imagined and set up long since on a barren mountain . Your little game shakes all belief , makes the young men question everything there is , and there are some matters a nation must not question if it is to continue . It must not question its virtues , its standards , its religion ! If any city questions these things it will wither away  --  its statesmen will sell out , its warriors will break and run , its poets will cease to sing , its women will turn toward the men of another nation who still have faith in themselves ! This is why your followers have betrayed us because you taught them corruption ! SOCRATES Is it corruption to examine into the conditions of life ? p. 99 LYCON If you examine the beliefs by which men live you kill those beliefs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not stand examination ? LYCON No ! No belief will bear examination ! Life will not bear it . A tree can not live if you look at its roots . SOCRATES This would be a very convenient rule for a tyrant or a dictator who did not wish to be examined , of course . LYCON But it 's true  --  and you know it 's true ! You taught your followers to believe in nothing , and you taught them the sleight of hand by which they could lead others astray  --  and you did this without fee  --  did it for sheer love of deviltry and evil . SOCRATES Oh , come now , Lycon  --  LYCON I say you did ! For pure love of evil , of destruction , of tearing down ! Out of hatred for Athens and its people and ways . SOCRATES Angry for the first timeYou lie ! I love Athens  --  and have always loved Athens  --  LYCON Then why do you injure her ? SOCRATES To the magistrateForgive me , sir ! One should not grow angry in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when I hear it said that I have not loved Athens I can not answer calmly ! To LyconAnd the thing I have loved most about my city is its freedom , its willingness to look at all the evidence there is and live in the same world with it . p. 100 LYCON Even if the evidence destroys it ? SOCRATES The evidence will not destroy a free city , Lycon . Far from destroying it , the truth will make and keep it free . A despotism dies of the truth , a democracy lives by it ! And now I thank you for making me angry , for I realize something which had never been clear to me before . Athens has always seemed to me a sort of mad miracle of a city , flashing out in all directions , a great city for no discoverable reason . But now I see that Athens is driven and made miraculous by the same urge that has sent me searching your streets ! It is the Athenian search for truth , the Athenian hunger for facts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athens unlike any other city . This is a city drenched with light  --  the light of frank and restless inquiry  --  and this light has flooded every corner of our lives : our courts , our theaters , our athletic games , our markets  --  even the open architecture of the temples of our gods ! This has been our genius  --  a genius for light , for open hearings , for the uncovering of secret things ; yes , for nakedness , for nakedness of the human body in the sun and for naked truth in the human mind ! Shut out the light and close our minds and we shall be like a million cities of the past that came up out of mud , and worshiped darkness a little while , and went back , forgotten , into darkness ! He turns to Lycon p. 101 LYCON Somewhat subduedI shall ask one more question  --  one that you have so far evaded . SOCRATES Yes , Lycon . LYCON Was Alcibiades your friend ? SOCRATES He was . LYCON Did he betray Athens ? SOCRATES Not while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice to me , Lycon , you must remember that when he betrayed Athens he betrayed me , and betrayed my teachings . For he turned away from us to serve a foreign tyrant . Perhaps freedom offers temptations that some minds are not able to resist . When a man is free he is free to choose wrong or right . In a free city no man chooses for another . I did not choose for Alcibiacies or Charmides or Critias . I have chosen only for myself . For myself I chose to fight for Athens at Potidaea and to walk the streets of Athens seeking the truth . LYCON If you had to choose between Athens and the search for truth , to which of these would you give your allegiance ? SOCRATES They are one and the same , fortunately . Yet if you wish me to say which I would choose if they were not the same  --  and I see that you do wish it , Lycon  --  I must say that the search for truth is more sacred than any god , more desirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more lovely than any city , even our own ! To the juryIf you have not seen this you will vote against me , and you should . But you are men of Athens , and you have seen it or Athens would not be here , would not from the beginning have been possible ! The unexamined life is not worth living ! The unexamined life is built on lies , and a free world can not live by lies . Only a world of slaves can live by lies ! p. 102 LYCON And so his allegiance is not to our city , but to the truth , the phantom truth that he has never found . I think that is enough . I leave the verdict to the men of Athens . ( He walks off the stage . SOCRATES turns to the magistrate MAGISTRATE If there is no further argument we can now put the case to a vote . The jurors will mark their ballots , and if they will then keep their seats while the ballots are counted the outcome of the trial will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHAEDO and CRITO climb up on it , hurry to Socrates and throw their arms round him . PAUSANIAS also climbs up and approaches Socrates with outstretched hand PAUSANIAS I shall never understand democracy . If they want to kill you why do they let you talk till you talk yourself clear out of it ? SOCRATES Taking his handAt least I 'm left in possession of the field ! PAUSANIAS You had them out of their depth and you had me out of my depth and maybe the same was true of the judge and the jury . MAGISTRATE If you will send up your ballots as rapidly as possible , members of the jury ! It will take only a few moments ! The lights dim down and go out for a little , to indicate a lapse of time . When they come up they show the magistrate in the center of the stage , a piece of paper in his hand . He studies the paper slowlyThe outcome of the trial  --  if you will be quiet for a moment  --  the total vote stands at  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands at  --  let me make sure of this  --  at 279 for conviction and 221 for acquittal . A light comes up on the edge of the stage and XANTIPPE is seen to rise , crying a single choked word . LAMPROCLES rises and puts his arm round her p. 103 XANTIPPE No ! LAMPROCLES Mother ! XANTIPPE sits and is quiet . The light comes up on Socrates who has heard the figures and comes to the center of the steps SOCRATES I think you said  --  279 for conviction ? MAGISTRATE I did , Socrates . SOCRATES Then I 'm found guilty . MAGISTRATE It seems so . SOCRATES Why , the jury which has been silent throughout has been thinking in its silence . And the outcome depends on the silent jury , not on us who were talking . I thought it would go the other way . MAGISTRATE I thought so , too . SOCRATES I thought it had gone the other way . He looks slowly round at the crowdI have not known my city then . More than half of these faces that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said , " No more for Socrates . " I 've lived too long , perhaps , and you grow tired of me . Well , it 's your right to grow weary of any man . ANYTAS and MELETOS come running back ANYTAS He 's guilty ? MELETOS Guilty ? Yes ? p. 104 MAGISTRATE He 's guilty . Satyros will take him into custody . ANYTAS But he 's about to speak again ! SATYROS climbs up and approaches Socrates MAGISTRATE Yes . To SocratesIt is now your privilege to propose an alternate punishment . The indictment asks for the death penalty . SOCRATES Thank you , sir . I shall speak to that presently . But , first , let me tell the citizens of something that just begins to dawn on me . My accusers think , no doubt , that my death would be a great victory for them and a calamity for Socrates . This is not the case . My death would be of enormous benefit to me , but a disaster to my accusers and to Athens . Look at what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have laid hands on an ancient , flea-bitten , philosophic scamp , getting toward the end of his days , and made him into a great man . I have been called Socrates the Wise in mockery sometimes . But if this judgment is carried out I shall be called Socrates the Wise in earnest . I shall be famous , and my accusers will be infamous for all time ! Look at this present you make me ! I am old , seventy years old ; I have lived a full life , I have done my work and said my say ; and if you were to let me die quietly in bed I should be quietly forgotten . But a martyr 's death sends a man off in a blaze of excitement and a blare of argument ! Has a man of seventy ever before been offered martyrdom and the glory that goes with it ? What could happen to me if I were to live out my life except the failure of powers which comes to brain and body in old age ? And so for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not welcome it because in just so much as it brightens my name it blackens the name of Athens . And quite simply and honestly , citizens , I love Athens more than myself . Though this sentence means only good fortune to me it means evil fortune to my city , and I plead with you : Do not do this : Reverse your judgment : Let me die the unknown death I deserve ! The alternate punishment I propose is that you fine me one mina  --  or thirty minae , or some such nominal sum  --  and maintain me henceforth at the public charge as a man serviceable to the state . That way I shall pass unnoticed into oblivion , and Athens will keep her good name . p. 105 ANYTAS A fine ! Oh , now we have him ! Now we have him ! MAGISTRATE This light sentence will never be accepted , Socrates . I must put it to the vote if you insist , but you will lose adherents and not gain them . SOCRATES Nevertheless , this is truly what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dishonest about it . LYCON You insult your accusers ! SOCRATES No , Lycon , but I try to keep the issue clear . Those who wish me to live believe in the life of thought ; those who wish me to die believe that men should do as they are told , without thinking . Those who wish me to live believe that every man should judge his own actions and those of his leaders ; those who wish me to die believe that only the leaders should judge  --  and that even the leaders should think only what their fathers thought . And so I ask that the alternate sentence be a light fine . But please remember , citizens , when you vote , that it is my good luck to be tried in a democracy , where injustice , when it happens , is public and infrequent and therefore a cause for protest and astonishment . Under Critias there were thousands of political executions . If I had died under Critias nobody would have heard of me . In a despotism injustice is the usual thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But here in Athens my death would be first a nine-days ' wonder , then a matter for controversy and recrimination  --  and then , in the end , if I am lucky in my friends and my times , my name and thoughts will last as long as our city 's history ! Truly , I do not wish my city dishonored to do me honor . And now  --  He turns to the magistrate p. 106 MAGISTRATE I must say again , Socrates , that if you give the jury no other choice the vote will go against you as before , or even more heavily against you . SOCRATES Why , in that case , sir , who at seventy , He turns to Satyroswho at seventy ever looked on a more beautiful visage than the face of this sad and ugly slave who brings men death ? The lights dim END OF SCENE p. 107 Act 2 , Scene 3 Act TwoSCENE 3 SCENE : The scene is Socrates ' cell before dawn some weeks later . Socrates lies asleep on a pallet on the floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waiting for him to wake . Phoenix leans against her knee . Lamprocles and Lysis stand waiting in the background . PHOENIX WhisperingWhy is he to die today ? XANTIPPE Hush ! Do n't wake him ! She turns to the older boysHe smiled in his sleep . He must be having good dreams . LYSIS I wonder if he ever had bad ones LAMPROCLES I doubt it . SOCRATES turns and opens his eyes SOCRATES What a strange dream ! He sits upI thought a woman came to me , tall and fair and smiling , and she called , " Socrates ! Socrates ! In three days ' time you will come to the fertile land of Phthia ! " She was some kind of messenger , and she was pleased to bring the message and I was pleased to receive it . XANTIPPE We watched you smiling in your sleep . SOCRATES Have you just come , Xantippe ? p. 108 XANTIPPE No , we 've been here some little time . We did n't like to wake you . SOCRATES Is it dark outside ? XANTIPPE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SOCRATES Still , you should have waked me . Why did you come early ? Was there a reason ? XANTIPPE Yes . SOCRATES The ship has come from Delos ? XANTIPPE Yes . At least it had reached Sunium last night , and word of it came overland . SOCRATES It should cast anchor today then . PHOENIX Why does the ship matter ? SOCRATES It 's a sacred ship , Phoenix , dedicated to Apollo . Every year at this time it makes a voyage to the shrine of the god , and while it goes and returns no criminal can be executed in Athens . It happened to set out during my trial and I 've had a long stay of execution . He rubs his legs above the chainsHow did you manage to get into the prison so early ? XANTIPPE Oh , Satyros knows us now . More than that , I think he 's inclined to grant us any little favors we want . SOCRATES We 'll have a few moments ' time together , at least , before this last day begins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a last day ? It 's not a time for banter , I suppose , and yet I do n't want to get off the usual stupid apothegms about loving your mother and being good citizens . Lamprocles , you 're going to be the head of the family  --  what shall we discuss ? p. 109 LAMPROCLES I 'm not going to admit for a moment that this is your last day . SOCRATES Then we can joke if we like . You still intend to be a soldier , Lamprocles ? LAMPROCLES Yes , sir . SOCRATES I 'm not sure you 're enough of a rascal to succeed at that . LAMPROCLES I 'm working on rascality . I listened to the trial very carefully . SOCRATES Yes , there were some lessons there . You do n't mean there was rascality on my side ? LAMPROCLES You use it for your own purposes . SOCRATES As a matter of fact , I do . Yes , you might make a soldier . Lysis , are you still studying ticks ? LYSIS No . That was a beetle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the greatest thing in the world . You can measure anything by geometry ! SOCRATES Can you measure the earth ? LYSIS They say there 's even a way to measure the earth now , by marking how the sun 's rays fall , first in one city and then in another . SOCRATES By the time you grow up perhaps it wo n't be atheistic to say such things . But watch it for a few years . p. 110 LYSIS I will . SOCRATES Phoenix , when you grow up and get married do n't keep your wife penned up in the women 's quarters . Let her out for a run once in a while . PHOENIX There wo n't be any women 's quarters in my house . My wife will walk all over my house , anywhere she pleases . SOCRATES Good . There speaks the new generation . Of course occasionally you may be sorry . You may wish that there were at least men 's quarters which she could n't enter  --  but I 'll let you settle that . PHOENIX Anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you ? PHOENIX Pausanias . SOCRATES Is Pausanias still here ? XANTIPPE He came back . He came back , he says , to get you out of prison . SOCRATES Good old Stupid ! XANTIPPE It was he who let us in early . He has influence with the guards . SOCRATES Influence is of many kinds , of course . XANTIPPE He has them all . One of the thugs enters SOCRATES Satyros is up early , too . He has sent a harbinger. p. 111 XANTIPPE It was he who let us in . Another thug enters , followed by SATYROS and PAUSANIAS . Theodote lingers discreetly in the background SOCRATES Why , this is hardly a prison at all ! Satyros , these shackles are somewhat numbing to the legs and feet . Welcome , Pausanias . PAUSANIAS You wo n't wear them much longer , Socrates . Greetings . He starts toward Socrates , but is stopped by the thugsWhat 's this ? SATYROS We do a cash business here . PAUSANIAS The money ? I think my credit should be good . SATYROS Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king of Sparta , you horrible clown . SATYROS There are no kings here , Stupid . PAUSANIAS I 'm not called Stupid by everybody , Satyros . SATYROS In Athens you are . In Athens anybody can call anybody anything . PAUSANIAS More democracy . Well , how do I know you 'll let him out ? SATYROS How do I know I 'll be paid ? PAUSANIAS Producing a sackTake it . Three hundred silver owls . SATYROS takes the sack and starts outWhere are you going ? p. 112 SATYROS To count it . PAUSANIAS Take off the leg irons first . SATYROS To his thugsTake them off . The thugs unlock the shackles and remove themThe children should not be here . SATYROS goes out THEODOTE I 'll take them out . Lysis , Phoenix . She takes the two younger boys by the hand and goes out with them . LAMPROCLES follows SOCRATES Forgive me for not rising . My legs do n't serve me at the moment . What are you buying from Satyros ? PAUSANIAS Socrates , when I went back to Sparta I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spartan king are hunting , making war , and dispensing justice in the courts . I went out as usual and killed some animals ; I made an expedition and reduced a small city  --  very profitable this was  --  and I sat as judge for a while . Nothing was satisfactory . I moped about the palace . I had the sensation of homesickness , of having lost what made life worth living . And when I went over it in my stupid brain it came down to this  --  I missed my Socrates and I missed my Theodote . I came back to get them . THEODOTE returns p. 113 SOCRATES And Theodote is complaisant ? THEODOTE I will go . SOCRATES And Satyros will sell me ? PAUSANIAS Glad to do it . He likes you . SOCRATES And Xantippe and the boys ? PAUSANIAS It 's all arranged , and there 's room for as many as you take with you . Xantippe wants a palace . Well , she shall have it . It 's cold , and it looks more like a barn , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yours . SOCRATES What a wonderful offer ! XANTIPPE And he offers you an income , Socrates . SOCRATES I 'm to be a man of means ! He rubs his legsWhat a singular relation pleasure has to pain ! The shackles were painful on my legs , and now the pain is gone and I feel great pleasure in its place . PAUSANIAS Also you 've been poor all your life and now you 're to be a rich man . It ought to work the same way . XANTIPPE It does . SOCRATES Xantippe , when a woman buys a fish in the market does she look at it before she pays ? XANTIPPE Now he 's going to say we must examine into this offer . p. 114 SOCRATES Should n't we ? XANTIPPE You 're being offered life in place of death ! SOCRATES Well , a life is more important than a fish , Xantippe . And it 's not only I who should examine what I am to receive . The king should examine me before he buys me from Satyros , for it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PAUSANIAS I know what I 'm getting . I 'm getting Socrates . SOCRATES But now remember what Socrates is . He is an obnoxious old fellow without sandals , badly dressed , walking up and down the streets putting annoying questions to the inhabitants . PAUSANIAS You wo n't have to go outside to talk , Socrates . You will sit in my palace with me and talk to me and my friends . None of this wandering about the streets . SOCRATES But suppose I grew tired of talking with important people and wanted to have a chat with shoemakers or weavers or the athletes in the palaestra ? PAUSANIAS Hm . SOCRATES What do you say ? PAUSANIAS Well , you know , this had n't occurred to me , but it is a difficulty . Nobody goes about asking questions in Sparta . And if you asked them nobody would answer you . p. 115 SOCRATES Why not , O King ? PAUSANIAS They  --  they would n't be interested . SOCRATES I might at length , after a while rouse some interest . PAUSANIAS It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staying in the palace and talking there . You see , Sparta is not a democracy . We do n't do things that way . SOCRATES In other words I would n't be allowed to talk ? PAUSANIAS Not in the streets , no . But mind you , you might have a great deal of influence on me . SOCRATES Do you mind if I call you Stupid ? PAUSANIAS From now on call me Stupid , nothing else . SOCRATES This is how it stands , Stupid . If the judge and the jury had told me they 'd let me off if I 'd stay at home and quit my question-and-answer game , I 'd have said " Proceed , gentlemen ; I 'll live as I 've always lived , and if that 's incompatible with the laws why put me out of the way . " In Sparta , as in Athens , I must wrangle and make inquiries in my accustomed fashion . Otherwise I prefer the hemlock . I 'm old and set in my ways . XANTIPPE Socrates , we have three children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility to bring them up and train them ? p. 116 SOCRATES Yes . I do n't like to leave you . XANTIPPE Surely there 's a city somewhere on the Mediterranean where a man can speak his mind . In Ionia , or Sicily , or farther west . SOCRATES Is there such a one , Stupid ? PAUSANIAS I 'm trying to think . No , Athens is the only democracy . The others are despotisms  --  of one or of many . It 's a pretty realistic world in the main . Several cities have tried democracy off and on , but it did n't work , it never does , and they got sick of it , and some enlightened strong man always took over . SOCRATES You mean that east and west , north and south , all round the Mediterranean , Athens is the one democracy ? PAUSANIAS As far as I know . Men need discipline , Socrates , and they like it , too . And they come back to it . SOCRATES Would I be subject to discipline if I went with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What kind of discipline would I use on you ? SOCRATES Suppose you took a dislike to me ? Suppose I were found out in the road , colloquing with villagers ? PAUSANIAS Look , you dizzy old goat , you 'd get your neck twisted , that 's all . p. 117 XANTIPPE AnguishedSocrates  --  I see a little streak of gray in the sky ! In a few moments they will all be here and Satyros wo n't be able to let you through . You 're all we have ! You 're all we 'll ever have ! The king would never hurt you . He just says these things when you corner him . It 's now or not at all , Socrates ! Maybe it does n't matter so much to you , maybe you can bear it , but think of us ! SOCRATES If I die here , Pausanias , will you take care of Xantippe ? PAUSANIAS Whether you come or stay she shall have her palace . SOCRATES gets up and puts his arm round Xantippe SOCRATES I have lived such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . We have known the greatest men who ever lived on this earth ; we knew Pericles and Aspasia and the masters of arts and words who built the Parthenon and filled the theater with music at the foot of the hill where it stands . We have lived as we pleased , thought what we pleased , said what we pleased . Shall I dwindle now into a king 's buffoon , hanging to the ragged end of life by saying the right things and keeping Stupid amused ? XANTIPPE But you 'd be alive ! SOCRATES Is that so important ? p. 118 XANTIPPE Then I 'll go ! Stay and die if you insist . The children shall have their chance . I 'll go ! SOCRATES Go if you must . If you think it 's good for them . But I think they 're better off in Athens . XANTIPPE Athens is killing you ! SOCRATES They seek for justice here . They do n't always find it but they seek it . They gave me a trial . Are there such trials in Sparta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide who 's guilty before the court sits . We have that much sense . SATYROS enters with the sack SATYROS There are three hundred drachmas here , Stupid , but fortyseven of them are Corinthian or worse . I want that fortyseven in Athenian owls . PAUSANIAS Later , then . SATYROS No , not later . Now . PAUSANIAS How am I going to find you forty-seven of the right kind now ? SATYROS You 'll find them  --  or he does n't live . PAUSANIAS You know what happens to slaves who speak to me that way ? They die ! SATYROS Pinion him ! The two thugs swiftly twist the king 's arms behind himAnd do n't talk about killing . You 're breaking the law here . You offered me money to release a prisoner . p. 119 PAUSANIAS And you took it ! SATYROS Prove that . He tosses the sack of money to the floor THEODOTE Coming forwardI have fifty Athenian drachmas here , Satyros . Take them , add them to what you have and let us go . She gives Satyros her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course you 'd lie . Why not ? But I 'll take them . And now go . All of you . XANTIPPE There 's light in the sky . SATYROS It 's not too late . There 's a back way . But be quick about it . To the thugsLet him go . The thugs release Pausanias . SATYROS picks up the sack SOCRATES You 'd better give the money back , Satyros . I 'm not leaving . SATYROS What trick is this ? SOCRATES No trick . I 'm not escaping . SATYROS We made our bargain , and the money 's changed hands . It 's too late to make new terms . SOCRATES You do n't take my meaning , Satyros . I 'm remaining in the prison . p. 120 SATYROS Why ? SOCRATES I prefer it to Sparta . SATYROS The hemlock is prepared and ready . You 're to drink it this morning . I have my orders . SOCRATES So we are to be together at the end , after all ! SATYROS The woman shall have her money back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have his . SOCRATES Good . SATYROS Returning the money to Theodote and PausaniasAnd now go . You 're free . It 's a gift from Satyros to Socrates ! Go ! SOCRATES You 've been a slave all your life , Satyros , and perhaps you wo n't understand this , but it 's better to die than to live not free . SATYROS I do n't understand it . I do n't want to give you the hemlock . SOCRATES You wo n't need to give it to me . Just bring it and I 'll drink it . PAUSANIAS Shall we remain while you drink it ? SOCRATES I think you should go . THEODOTE Crito and Phaedo are here . CRITO and PHAEDO enter at the rear p. 121 SOCRATES I 'll converse with them over the cup . XANTIPPE Oh , Socrates ! SOCRATES Yes  --  XANTIPPE If you drink it  --  this is the last time  --  for your friends , and for you and for me ! SOCRATES Maybe there 's no good way , Xantippe , but I think this comes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go now with Pausanias . You and Theodote . XANTIPPE Do you have no last word for me ? SOCRATES Do you think we can better now what we have given each other over all these years ? PAUSANIAS To XantippeCome . XANTIPPE Then I have a last word for you . I shall not go to Sparta . I shall live in our old house on the three obols a day . SOCRATES You do this for the children ? XANTIPPE No , for you . I can remember you there . It 's the only way I can keep you . Any of you . Will you be with me there sometimes ? SOCRATES Perhaps I shall not be there or anywhere , Xantippe . Nowhere at all . XANTIPPE But in spirit  --  if I could have your spirit with me  --  p. 122 SOCRATES My spirit you can certainly have , and anyone can have it who remembers it and wants it . XANTIPPE Yes . You escape me now as before . SOCRATES We all escape when we die , Xantippe . From everybody . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obols ? XANTIPPE Yes . SOCRATES Then  --  He goes close to herWill you sometimes say my prayer for me ? XANTIPPE If I remember it . SOCRATES Putting his arm round herSay it now , and I 'll prompt you if you forget , and then you 'll have it all . XANTIPPE Now ? SOCRATES Yes , now . XANTIPPE " Beloved Pan , and all you other gods who haunt this city "  --  oh , no , no , no ! I ca n't lose you ! I ca n't live ! SOCRATES Go on , Xantippe . " Give me beauty in the inward soul "  --  XANTIPPE " Give me beauty in the inward soul "  --  SOCRATES " For outward beauty I 'm not likely to have "  --  XANTIPPE " For outward beauty I 'm not likely to have "  --  The lights begin to dim down and during the next speeches go out entirely p. 123 SOCRATES " May I reckon the wise to be the wealthy "  --  XANTIPPE I know the rest . " May I reckon the wise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most like the gods . " The lights are out
