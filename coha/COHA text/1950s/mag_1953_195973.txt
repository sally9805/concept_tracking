As Democratic leaders bustled about last week planning a big dinner , acute indigestion set in . <P> National Chairman Stephen Mitchell had wanted a banker to be general chairman of the Sept. 14 $100-a-plate feast in Chicago , because the chairmanship was essentially a money-raising job . But the banker he asked suggested that he appoint a lawyer , one John James Kelly . Mitchell checked with Chicago 's Mayor Martin H. Kennelly , who said that was just fine . Kelly and the mayor are old friends , live in the same apartment building . But after Mitchell appointed Kelly , he learned that his chairman was not an old friend of very many Cook County Democratic organization men . The reaction in the wards : " Let Kelly sell the tickets . " <P> Then Mitchell selected his toastmaster : Iowa 's Senator Guy M. Gillette , whose campaign for re-election next year would be helped by all the publicity . This was most displeasing to General Chairman Kelly , who wanted to be his own toastmaster and introduce the guest of honor , Adlai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good opening for Iowa 's State Chairman Jake More . Knowing exactly who the good guys and the bad guys are in the minds of many Iowa voters , More roared that " city slickers " had tried to keep lowan Gillette off the program . <P> While all this was going on , Southern Democrats began throwing you alls into Mr. Mitchell 's chowder . Florida 's Senator Spessard Holland said he had declined an invitation to attend the dinner because he thinks the South will gain nothing there . Virginia 's Senator Harry Byrd said he had not been invited . South Carolina 's Governor James F. Byrnes said he would not go if he were invited . <P> All of this internal rumbling before dinner caused some pundits to diagnose a new case of discord in the Democratic Party . But observers with good memories settled back to watch the Democrats being just Democrats in a normal , non-election-year performance .
