Into the heavens over the Atlantic Ocean one night last week thundered a 100-ton symbol of U.S. scientific skill and diligence : the Air Force 's Atlas intercontinental ballistic missile . Fully powered with close to 370,000 lbs . of thrust , the 80-ft. beast leaped from its Cape Canaveral pad , rocketed off the Florida coast into the starry night and arched serenely over the moon . The Cape 's missile watchers held their breath as , in shucking its booster motors , the ICBM blazed like a meteor 200 miles from earth ; then it faded and seemed to hang for a long time , suspended , like a star-colored point , just below Orion . <P> Tracking Far . Electronic tracking told the rest of the story : Atlas coursed over an ocean at 16,000 m.p.h .. past the equator , past Ascension island , to a point near St. Helena , where the exiled and imprisoned Napoleon died , until , only 1,200 miles from the African coast and only 30 minutes after launching , its nose cone shot down into the South Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , equal to the span between Denver and Peking , or between an Alaskan launching site and any major target in the Northern Hemisphere . Thus , after only 17 months of flight-testing , Atlas in one epochal shot was well on its way to being the No. 1 weapon of the U.S. 's strategic arsenal . <P> The months were counted in bitter challenges met . Of the 13 short-range Atlas tests , five exploded during flight . In the first attempt on Sept. 18 to go full distance , the missile blew up 80 seconds after launching . But last week 's countdown was delayed only 27 minutes for a minor technical difficulty . Running the test and pressing the big button was a man appropriately named for the job : Engineer Bob Shotwell , 47 . With great restraint , Shotwell and his 40-man launch team quietly waited in their bunker a full seven minutes after the lift-off before they dared shout . Then , says Shotwell , " everybody started congratulating everybody . We knew we had done it . It was going like a bullet ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlas contractor , Convair , launched a bubbly champagne party at the nearby Starlite Motel , and the jubilant missilemen hoisted Operations Manager B. G. ( for Byron Gordon ) MacNabb ( TIME , Dec. 30 ) on their shoulders and carried him around the room . <P> Coming Fast . The rejoicing meant as much to the nation as to Atlas ' dogged crews . Despite the Sputnik furor and the panicky cries that the U.S. was lagging behind the Russians in missilery , Convair and the Air Force stuck stubbornly to a schedule that was programed for maximum effort long before Sputnik . Atlas will need many more tests-and particularly refinement of its guidance system-before it is a real operational weapon . But if , as they claim , the Russians have already fired an ICBM ( 3,500 miles , according to U.S. intelligence guesses ) , the successful full-range Atlas flight makes it clear that Russia has no monopoly . It also makes clear that the U.S. missile program , already equipped with the first operational intermediate-range missiles , is coming and coming fast .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
