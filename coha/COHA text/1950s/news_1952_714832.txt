txt On his return from Europe early this Week Bernard M. Baruch told newsmen he was shocked by the revived possibilities of inflation in this country and by the defeatist attitude shown toward it by stabilization officials . It was n't clear whether Mr. Baruch had in mind Price Administrator Ellis Arnall or Economic Stabilizer Roger Putnam , or both . Mr. Arnall has gone to great pains to convince the public that he has consistently opposed the price increase granted the steel companies , though we do n't recall any similar expression of resentment when the Wage Stabilization Board lifted the roof bodily off wages , the action from which the price rise flowed . Last week , after the price rise had been granted , Mr. Arnall vouchsafed the observation in a radio address that it would " add at least 100 to the average family 's budget . " Though this figure has been challenged flatly by Ernest T. Weir of the steel industry as " completely untrue " and has been questioned by numerous others , including this newspaper , Mr. Arnall has thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rested on anything more substantial than his own vivid imagination . Mr. Arnall has continued to demonstrate this week that if he does n't know how to proceed in combating inflation he most emphatically knows how to stimulate it . He told a television audience that the present drought is going to " mean disaster to your pocketbook . " Mr. Putnam , on the other hand , seems equally determined to let it be known that he is not a fatalist about the inflation implications of the steel decision . " There has been too much talk , " says he , " about what the stabilization agencies ca n't do tattier the present law and too little emphasis upon the powers we still retain . " As a disinterested comment this would be a highly commendable statement . But let us see just what form Mr. Putnam 's non-fatalism takes . " You hear , " he is quoted as saying , " that prices of passenger cars will advance $10 to $15 because higher steel prices will affect to that extent the cost of the ton and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am confident that auto prices will not advance at all on this account * ? ? . " It seems that Mr. Putnam and Mr. Arnall have been working on a plan under which " fabricators and distributors between mill and ultimate consumer each would absorb part of the price increase . " Now what Mr. Putnam is proposing , of course , is merely a scheme for concealing the effects of the inflationary steel wage decision of March . It might be described as a sort of reverse subsidy . Needless to say , however , it Would not restore the status quo ante with respect to the steel wage decision of //Larch ; neither would it serve to counteract the latter 's effect of adding hundreds of millions of dollars to the country 's purchasing power , without any offset in the form of increased production . And while it may obscure it , it does not alter the fact that raising costs all along the line from producer to consumer without a commensurate price rise means a corresponding reduction in profits  --  profits the major share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of taxes . Mri Baruch has referred to the inflation with which the nation is now threatened as " legalized inflation . " Some time back this newspaper used the term " official inflation . " Probably the generic term " political inflation " would cover both . It is no accident , therefore , that in connection with the contrivance he proposes for reducing inflation 's visibility Mr. Putnam would " safeguard the consumer 's interests " by imposing " severer punishments in violation cases . " This , as most students of history know , has been the classic formula of political inflation from time immemorial . The Government itself sets in motion the forces that must inevitably undermine the value ( purchasing power ) of the currency , whether by clipping the coinage , issuing fiat money , or bestowing largess on favored pressure groups in the state . Having done so it then proceeds to establish and maintain two standard fictions , to wit : ( 1 ) that inflation is nonexistent , and ( 2 ) that if it does exist , then someone else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one course , which , if the history of such episodes can be relied upon , we may assume with complete confidence will be avoided at all costs and under all circumstances . That is the simple , if distasteful , one of removing the cause of rising prices by reversing its inflationary policies ,
