txt Special to Tut New Yoax Totes . WASHINGTON , Feb. 6 ? That familiar guessing game of American politics  --  whether the President will run.for a second term ? has already begun . It is a bit early even for the most speculative guessers , yet the success or failure of the Republican party in this year 's Congressional elections is bound to have considerable influence on President Eisenhower 's political future . And the success of the party this year will depend substantially on President Eisenhower 's leadership and the fate of his legislative program . A couple of weeks ago General Eisenhower , still innocent of the ways of politicians and of political reporters , indicated he was looking ahead no more than three years . He was saying he could be objective in opposing the proposed Bricker amendment because the process of changing the Constitution required considerable time , and certainly could not affect what was done during the next three years . This seeming limit on his tenure was enough to start the guessing game : A reporter wanted to know if General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President was prepared , however . He said his political friends had advised him never to talk about second-term possibilities and maybe he had better delete the remark Governor Thomas E. Dewey of New York said this week he certainly expected and hoped that the President would run for a sece and term in 1956 . He predicted without hesitation that Mr. Eisenhower would win again . Presidential Ambitions The question of self-succession has ever been an intriguing one in American politics . A President who serves out part of a term after the death of his predecessor is usually anxious to get elected in his own right . The most recent instance was Harry S. Truman in 1948 . A President who does only a middling job in his first term yearns to try again and do better . If he does a fine job in the first term he is just as likely to want to continue the good work . In fact , his political associates , naturally desirous of perpetuating themselves in office , will affirm that it is his solemn , patriotic duty to run again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now restricted to two fouryear terms by the Twenty-second Constitutional Amendment of 1951 , runs strong in any occupant of the highest office . Some of the emotions and motives which influence a President ' during his first term have been expressed by Jefferson . He re- ' peatedly revealed his fears be-I cause the Constitution originally failed to provide against the per petual re-eligibility of the President . He decided to run for a second term only after the Federalist opposition stirred him up . To Elbridge Gerry he wrote : " I sincerely regret that the unbounded calumnies of the Federal party have obliged me to throw myself on the verdict of my country for trial , my great desire having been to retire , at the end of the present term , to a life of tranquility ; and it was my decided purpose when I entered into office . They force my continuance . If we can keep the vessel of state as steadily in her course for another four years , my earthly purposes will be accomplished , and I shall be free to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books . " Second-Term Presidents Although the Republican party governed for fifty-eight years between 1856 , the year of its founding , and 1952 , only Ulysses S. Grant of that party served two full four-year terms . Tragedy prevented Lincoln and from serving out their second terms . During the same period the Democrats governed only forty years , and they won ten elections while the Republicans won fifteen . But the Democrats , with their longer tenures , had only five different men in office during their forty years while the Republicans had thirteen in fiftyeight years . It would be futile to speculate about President Eisenhower 's attitude three years hence and even more futile to expect him to ' make a commitment one way or another in the near future . It is not untimely to note , however , that a man like President Eisenhower , with his highly developed sense of duty , seems likely to want to serve for two terms whether time , politics and events have served him well or ill . He has said the Presidency is not a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed it rather as a call to higher service . He is quite aware that the job is tough , although he would be the last man to complain about it . He works intensively , at a much more rapid tempo than his ' predecessor , and-that is a reason for the more frequent vacation breaks that he takes . Yet he works with zest and easy goodwill , and he is more relaxed now when he meets the press . Vigorous Man The President , now 63 years old , will be 66 one month before the 1956 election . Mr. Truman was 64 in 1948 when he made his grueling campaign for re-election . President Eisenhower is an extremely vigorous man . His stride alone bespeaks the vigor of a man much younger than he is . Hence infirmity is not likely ! to be one of his troubles . As might be expected from a man with these characteristics , the President has intensified the tempo around the White House . Even if he will not say so , he acts like a man who enjoys the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he apIpears to have made an easy adjustment to new tasks and routines in his first year . It is easy to imagine that he views his immense responsibility as a challenge that he can manage with confidence . Two Achievements On the international horizon he has two achievements that are most gratifying to him in any self-analysis of his role. , These are the truce in Korea and the perceptible shift from a static policy of containment of Russia . He has taken the initiative in world affairs , both psychologically and by action . So it is difficult to imagine at this stage that he would look upon a second term with repugnance . Therefore , the problem uppermost in Republican ? leaders ' minds right now is not whether President Eisenhower will run again in 1956 but whether they can sustain the winning streak by a demonstration of party solidarity , efficient government and a sound program . The loss of Congress to the Democrats by a substantial majority conceivably could induce the Republican party to look for another nominee in 1956 , but that is highly unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people 's trust , was the dominant factor of the 1952 campaign and no other Republican figure approaching his stature has yet begun to rise . President Eisenhower has begun to meet the tests of a tough political year with calm determi ? nation in the emotional debate over the proposed Bricker amendment . It is a test of his leadership not only within the ranks of his own party  --  the whole nation is watching . Many people perhaps will be interested less in his position on this issue , fundamental and vital though it is , than in the question of whether he will be able to marshal his party forces without serious casualties after the battle is over . For several more difficult issues , like the tariff question and the explosive farm policy , will have to be dealt with before election day . Back in April , 1953 , the late Senator Robert A. Taft predicted that the pressures would build up and induce President Eisenhower to run again . That may be , but one thing is certain : he does n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That will be time enough .
