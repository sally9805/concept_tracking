Headon , the thing suggested an amphibious flying saucer with rudder trouble . From the rear it looked like Old Faithful on a rampage . To the motorboat experts who got up at 6 a.m. one day last week in Seattle to see it perform , it looked like the fastest thing afloat . <P> The 4,200-lb. monster was a mahogany-oak-duraluminum racing hull , inappropriately named Slo-Mo-Shun IV . At the wheel was ruddy , grey-haired Stanley St. Clair Sayres , who started tinkering with outboard motorboats twelve years ago , switched to airplanes , and switched back to speedboats when his wife made him give up flying . With the help of a Boeing aircraft engineer , he had built his flounder-shaped hydroplane to crack the world 's speedboat record . <P> After waiting for days for the right weather , Sayres sent his craft thundering into the measured mile , trailing a 20-ft. spume 200 yards behind . A 4-in. chop on Lake Washington provided enough lift to send the two-ton craft clipping along on her two 8-in. - square planing surfaces . Offset rudders above &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south-north run , her Allison aircraft engine sent Slo-Mo-Shun screaming through the mile in 21.98 seconds . The return trip was less than a second slower . The combination gave Sayres an average speed of 160.32 m.p.h. , 18.58 m.p.h. faster than the old mark , set by Sir Malcolm Campbell 's Blue Bird II in 1939 . Already looking for a more fitting name for his new world champion ( current choice : Miss Seattle ) , Driver Sayres expects to set his next record at the Gold Cup races in Detroit later this month . Says Sayres : " The boat was not extended . "
