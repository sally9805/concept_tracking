" Will Ike come home in time ? " is the greatest cliff-hanger question since Phil Sheridan was 20 miles away . As of New Hampshire Primary Day , these pertinent facts , and these only were clear : <P> 1 ) Ike now wants to be President and will take any honorable step consistent with his military position to get the G.O.P. nomination . <P> 2 ) His closest advisers have told him in terms of increasing urgency that he must come home by May 1 at the latest , and must declare his intention to come home within the next few weeks . <P> 3 ) Nevertheless , Ike has not made a firm promise to anybody that he will be home by any date . His staff in France is proceeding on the assumption that he means to stay . Last week Robert P. Burroughs of New Hampshire made public an Ike letter of Feb. 27 in which Ike said he had not budged from his Jan. 7 statement : " Under no circumstances will I ask relief from this NATO assignment in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possible avenue of escape from this sweeping statement . Ike 's friends might possibly persuade President Truman to relieve Ike without a request from him . Or Ike might simply face the embarrassment , announce that he has changed his mind , and ask to be relieved and returned to inactive military status . <P> In case neither of these courses opens up , Eisenhower supporters can pay heed to the words last week of Malcolm S. Forbes , a New Jersey state senator just back from a chat with Ike in Paris . Said Forbes : " It is high time those of us active in the fight to gain him the nomination stop wringing our hands and screaming , ' Come home , Ike , or all is lost . ' We must . . . fight the fight on our own hook . "
