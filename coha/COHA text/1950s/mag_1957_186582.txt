I , MADAME TUSSAUD ( 370 pp. ) - Sylvia Martin-Harper ( $3.95 ) . <P> <P> No sooner had the guillotine decapitated King Louis XVI than an official seized the head by the hair and hurried it to Anne Marie Grosholtz who. after signing a receipt for it , laid it in her lap and began covering the warm features with plaster . In this way , Anne Marie ( better known by her married name of Madame Tussaud ) made death masks of many an old acquaintance and patron , including Marie Antoinette , Princess Elizabeth of France ( whose lady attendant she had been ) , Danton and Robespierre . She was an artist to her fingertips . <P> Anne Marie was born in Strasbourg in 1760 . Her uncle , Philip Curtius , was a former medical student whose flair for modeling human limbs in wax led to the creation in Paris of ' ' Dr. Curtius ' Cabinet , " a showroom filled with wax-and-wood dummies of famous men and women . Anne Marie became Philip 's adopted daughter and learned the tricks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial skulls , how to tint and warm the cold wax . When she was 19 , Uncle Philip wangled her into the bedchambers of Versailles , where she doubled as sculptress to the court and agent for the " Cabinet , " which she kept supplied with dummy heads of the great . <P> Posthumous Record . Nine years at Versailles gave Anne Marie ample opportunity to model and sketch the French nobility from life . When the Revolution came , she turned to death masks of the same nobles - and when the revolutionaries started using the guillotine on one another , Anne Marie was still right there , modeling away . <P> She did the living Danton one day , the guillotined Danton a little later ; when Charlotte Corday stabbed Marat , his body was later put back in the bath tub and the knife back into Marat , so that " Citizenness Grosholtz " could make a true posthumous record for the people of Paris . Anyone who wanted to know which faction was " in " and which " out " had only to stroll to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precisely in accordance with their living models . <P> <P> The Undefiled . This Enlightened Age highly valued art , and the great revolutionary painter , Louis David , highly valued Anne Marie . He called her " The Undefiled , " because ( as he saw it ) she was surrounded by corruption but was never smirched by it . She was middle-aged when the legend of her " pure " artistry reached England , and she traveled to London with her grisly masks and busts . One of her last waxworks-a self-portrait done at the age of 82 , seven years before she died-may still be seen in the famous institution she founded in London . <P> I , Madame Tussaud would have been a better book if U.S. Author Sylvia Martin had written a straight biography instead of a romanticized piece of fiction . Nonetheless , Author Martin does suggest-and all the more clearly for not meaning to-that Heroine Tussaud may have been a forerunner of the " undefiled " women who whiled away the Hitler war making artistic lampshades out of human skins .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
