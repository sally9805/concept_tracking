Harry Heilmann was a tall , husky man ( 6 ft. , 195 Ibs. ) , an outfielder ( mainly for Detroit ) who spent 13 years in the major leagues cowing opposing pitchers . He won the American League batting championship four times , one season hit .403 . His lifetime average was .342 , a mark bettered by only six other players. * <P> When his big-league days were over in 1932 , Heilmann made a new career as a sports announcer on Detroit radio stations . But his great ambition , election to baseball 's Hall of Fame in Cooperstown , N.Y. , always eluded him . Lesser men made it ; Heilmann 's misfortune was that he had played in the shadow of such titans as Tris Speaker , Rogers Hornsby , Babe Ruth and Harry 's own teammate , Ty Cobb . <P> Recently , hearing that Heilmann was seriously ill , Cobb wrote to several of his baseball-writer friends , urging them not to bypass Harry in this year 's selections . Last week New York Times Columnist Arthur Daley printed part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , long overdue . The appeal came too late . At last week 's All-Star game in Detroit , 50,000 fans stood and observed a moment of silence . The day before , Harry Heilmann , 56 , had died of cancer in Detroit . <P> <P> * Ty Cobb ( .367 ) , Rogers Hornsby ( .358 ) , Dan Brouthers ( .348 ) , Ed Delahanty ( .346 ) , Willie Keeler ( .345 ) , Tris Speaker ( .344 ) . Babe Ruth and Jess Burkett also hit .342.
