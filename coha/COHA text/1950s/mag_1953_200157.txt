High on a New Jersey hilltop , overlooking colonial steeples and the Delaware River , music fills the clear air six nights a week . It rises from a huge , floodlit , green and yellow tent , home of Lambertville 's Music Circus . Under the big top ( where there is room for 1,500 ) the attractions are Broadway shows ( with good second-string casts ) such as Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and Call Me Madam , and such vintage operettas as Sweethearts , New Moon and Die Fledermaus . Last week , the Music Circus put on view a frothy revival of Orpheus in the Underworld , by Jacques Offenbach . The new title : To Hell with Orpheus . <P> Excursion to Hades . Offenbach was a kind of 19th century , Parisian Cole Porter , only better . A superb musical satirist , he could also turn out sentimental waltzes and respectable grand opera , but his specialty was cancan , with its piston-like rhythm and irrepressible gaiety . Orpheus contains some of his best satire and his best cancan tunes . The libretto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with additional lyrics by Edward Eager ) tries to modernize the original . The result is stained Varsity-Show humor , but still fun . <P> The show opens in a stiff-backed summer camp at Brunswick , Me. ( in the original , the scene was Thebes ) , where a young matron named Eurydice Orpheus is shamelessly cuckolding her husband , a struggling violinist . Her lover : one John Stick , a dull poet . Enter Pluto , in the guise of a soft-drink peddler , who offers the lovers a permanent visit to Hades . Sample of his spiel : <P> If you would like a long vacation Your reservation I 'll quickly fix-You 'll simply love my old plantation Way down upon the River Styx ! <P> The scene switches to Mount Olympus , where Jupiter is having trouble with his wife Juno . She berates him for his old trick of assuming the shape of a shepherd , a bull or a swan for purposes of dalliance ( " Though the girls are squeezable , " leers Cupid , " with a swan it is n't feasible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Baritone Ralph Herbert ) takes Juno and the other gods on a junket to Hades , where they bump into Eurydice ; after a few random shots from Cupid 's bow , everything ends in a happy shambles . The " go-to-hell " joke is worked pretty hard in the dialogue , but that is offset by Offenbach 's tunes . At least two of them . An Old Love Dies and Brunswick Maine , could be hits in any century . <P> Fire-Eater . The man responsible for this Orpheus , as well as for the circus itself , is St. John Terrell , 36 , a Chicago-born showman who pronounces his given name " Sinjun , " in the English fashion-not because he is English but , as he explains , because he started off his entertainment career as a fire-eater . After kicking around show business from the age of 16 ( carnivals , U.S.O. , Broadway and summer theater ) , he decided five years ago to set up a musical tent show . He picked Lambertville ( pop . 4,477 ) because it was far enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County , Pa. ' s " genius belt " to have an interested audience . Almost from the start , the tent has drawn big crowds all summer long . Last year 's attendance : 160,000 ; this year 's estimate : 175,000.
