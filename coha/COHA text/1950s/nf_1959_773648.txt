txt // THE CONCEPTS OF FORCE AND MASS 8.1 . THE MOTIONS OF REAL BODIES In the last four chapters we have been considering motion in its own right : only in the last of the four have we based these considerations on an actual example of motion in the real world . Henceforward we shall be concerned with real motions exclusively , that is with the subject kinetics rather than with kinematics . The word kinetics implies that the concept of force is fundamental to our enquiry : force in relation to motion . The idea of force has a long history . It arose , no doubt , from the consciousness of the muscular effort required to lift heavy bodies from the earth 's surface . Such bodies are heavy ' in that they tend to fall to the ground , unless supported in some way ; moreover , it requires muscular effort to set them in motion in the reverse direction , to lift them . Also , in general experience , it requires muscular effort to move a body over the surface of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to rest . But it was not until the seventeenth century that this intuitive idea of force was given the precision of a scientific concept . It is not surprising , perhaps , that in the physics of Aristotle terrestrial motions and celestial motions were regarded as in separate categories . The heavenly bodies were not regarded as subject to the same laws as determine the motions of earthly bodies . Only the continuance of motion had to be explained in each case : the condition of rest was regarded as the natural condition of bodies everywhere . The motions of the heavenly bodies were perfect ' , these bodies were carried around by the transparent spheres , each moved by a soul ' which was of its essential nature . Near the earth 's surface heavy bodies sought the centre of the universe in the depths below , similarly following the dictates of their own natures . Other terrestrial motion was violent ' motion : it continued only so long as an operative cause persisted . This hypothetical cause had often to be sought in the medium through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the water , // as the case might be , transmitting continuing motion to the moving body . Violent ' motion was unthinkable in a vacuum ( therefore , the argument ran in part , there could be no such thing as empty space ) . Butterfield has written ( The Origins of Modern Science ) A universe constructed on the mechanics of Aristotle had the door half-way open for spirits already ... the modern theory of motion is the great factor which in the seventeenth century helped to drive the spirits out of the world and opened the way to a universe that ran like a piece of clockwork ' . But the attempt to drive these particular spirits out of the world had in fact been made much earlier than the seventeenth century , though it had not been very successful . About the middle of the fourteenth century , in Paris , first Jean Buridan ( who was born in the last decade of the thirteenth century and became Rector of the University of Paris in 1327 ) , and later Nicolas Oresme ( who became bishop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishop of Halberstadt , 1366-1390 ) , taught that persistence of violent ' motion is due to impetus ' or impetuosity ' acquired in the original process of projection , and in the fall of heavy bodies continuously acquired . In motion under terrestrial conditions , the impetus of a moving body , if not renewed , gradually weakens , so these philosophers taught , just as a poker grows cold when taken from the fire ' . This doctrine of impetus continued to be taught in Paris for nearly two hundred years , Leonardo da Vinci ( 1452-1519 ) found it spoken of in Pavia in 1490 , and its influence on the early thinking of Galileo ( 1564-1642 ) can be discerned in his writings . By that time , however , the doctrine had served its purpose ; the experiments which Galileo performed in Pisa in the years 1589 to 1591 gave a new turn to his thought , and the doctrine of impetus became the principle of inertia , at least in a limited field of application . Galileo Galilei entered the University of Pisa in 1581 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the classics , well known as a musician , and was showing promise as a painter . But his father had chosen medicine for him as a career , having had personal experience of the unremunerative character both of music and mathematics ' . This choice , however , though clearly prudent , was not for long effective ; the young Galileo abandoned medicine for mathematics , and it might appear as the swift retribution of fate that in 1585 he had to leave the university , through lack of funds , without a degree . Undeterred by this misfortune , however , I22 MASS , LENGTH AND TIME he continued to follow his own inclinations , and within three years he had made such a name for himself by his writings that , no longer a student , he found himself called to the staff of the university as lecturer in mathematics . His tenure of this appointment was brief : within a further three years he had aroused so much enmity by the sharpness of his tongue that he wisely resigned his post . But he was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of mathematics at the University of Padua , and there he remained for eighteen years . In 1610 , at the height of his fame , he retired to Florence , endowed with the emoluments of his professorship for life , and the lucrative sinecure of philosopher and mathematician extraordinary to the grand-duke of Tuscany . Then , again , the sharpness of his tongue and the pungency of his writings brought him trouble . For us it would take too long to record the history of Galileo 's conflict with the Church , a conflict which started in 1613 , came to a crisis in 1632 following the publication of his Dialogues on the Two Systems of the World , and was resolved before the Inquisition on 22 June 1633 in the church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome . The story has often been told in the histories of science , embroidered by invention or simplified by omission . As a corrective it will be sufficient to quote the more recent verdict of Whitehead ( Science and the Modern World ) : In a generation which saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Netherlands , the worst that happened to men of science was that Galileo suffered an honourable detention and a mild reproof , before dying peacefully in his bed . ' Galileo died on 8 January 1642 , in his villa at Arcetri to the south-east of Florence . He had lived there , virtually under house-arrest , since the time of his sentence , but his scientific activities had been undiminished to the end , and the recapitulation of the results of his early experiments in mechanics , and his considered views on the principles of that subject , which were published under the title Dialogues on the New Sciences in Leiden in 1638 , constitute a work of timeless importance . As has already been indicated ( p. 121 ) , it is Galileo 's early experiments in Pisa ( 1589-1591 ) which chiefly concern us here . Modern scholarship discounts the frequently repeated story of his demonstration of the equality of times of fall of light and heavy bodies by dropping a musket-ball and a cannon-ball simultaneously from the top of the Leaning Tower ( an inconclusive experiTHE // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Stevinus and de Groot at Delft in 1590 ) , but the conclusions which he drew from his experiments with inclined planes indicated that such indeed would be the result of an ideal experiment of that nature , if the retarding effect of the air could be eliminated . His conclusions , however , were more detailed than that , and basically more important . Galileo conceived of free fall and free horizontal motion ( near the surface of the earth ) as extreme cases of motion down a perfectly smooth inclined plane , the inclination in the first case being 90 ? , and in the second case zero . For him there was a difference in degree , not in character , between these two types of motion , and , in thought , a continuous gradation , as he imagined the inclination of an ideal plane decreased from 90 ? to zero . In practice he was able to convince himself that the motion of metal balls on the polished and grooved surfaces of the wooden planes which he had at his disposal was sufficiently near to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results of this study Galileo deduced three important conclusions , one of them quantitative and the other two qualitative in form of expression . The quantitative conclusion concerned the manner in which the speed of the body increases throughout its motion , in the type of motion he was considering . Here the recognition that the characteristics of free fall are to be found , modified only in scale , in motion down an inclined plane under ideal conditions , was essential for the generality of his conclusions . Galileo 's water-clocks were not sufficiently sensitive instruments for the timing of free fall under laboratory conditions , but they sufficed for the observations which he made on motion down inclined planes of small inclination . Assuming that the law of increase of velocity could be expressed in a simple mathematical formula , he considered the two simplest possibilities , that the instantaneous velocity is proportional to the distance moved from rest , and , alternatively , that it is proportional to the elapsed time . It is not surprising that he ran into difficulties in considering the first possibility ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never start from rest ) , for the calculus had not then been invented , and the notion of velocity-at-aninstant was itself a novelty . But , on the basis of the second possible law , Galileo deduced ( which we have done by a simple graphical treatment in ? 4.4 ) that the distance moved should be proportional to the square of the elapsed time . His experiments showed that I24 MASS , LENGTH AND TIME this was precisely the situation in fact : his intuition regarding mathematical simplicity had been justified , and , extrapolating to the case of free fall , his quantitative conclusion could be expressed in free fall under gravity the distance travelled from rest is proportional to the square of the time of fall ' . However , it is the mathematical insight behind the quantitative conclusion which is the essential contribution of Galileo at this point : in such motion , in particular in free fall under gravity , the velocity increases linearly with the time . Indeed , the modern concept of acceleration entered physics at this juncture , exemplified in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' near the surface of the earth . The first of Galileo 's qualitative conclusions can now be simply expressed : the accelerations of different bodies , down a fixed inclined plane , are the same under ideal conditions . Here we need not labour the description of the experiments by which this limiting result was deduced ' from actual observations under conditions which were not perfectly ideal ? obviously the intuition of the observer must come into play before such an assertion can ever be made . But in these experiments at least we find the laboratory counterpart of the experiment from the Leaning Tower , with which his first biographer , Vincenzio Viviani , credited Galileo ( as he falsely credited him with the invention of the microscope ) and which later historians were not slow to embellish with colourful detail . We merely remark that this first qualitative conclusion marks the initial acceptance of the acceleration due to gravity ' , as a geophysical constant of real significance . Galileo 's second qualitative conclusion was fundamentally more important than the first . He carried out experiments in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shallow V , and he concluded that , under ideal conditions , a ball which had rolled freely down one plane would roll up the other losing speed , as it had previously gained speed in descent , until it came to rest , momentarily , at a height above the horizontal which was equal to the height from which it had started . Under ideal conditions the slope of the second plane was immaterial , if the ball was always released from the same point on the first plane , it would travel along the second plane until its velocity became instantaneously zero when it had reached its original height above ground . From this point of view only the vertical component of the motion was // important . Moreover , in the limiting case in which the second plane was itself horizontal , under ideal conditions the ball , never able to regain its original height , would travel forwards indefinitely with undiminished velocity . This is Galileo 's novel contribution to the foundation of dynamics , deduced from experiment through the intuition of genius . The slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexhaustible , except by the action of resistive forces . On a horizontal plane , in the ideal situation , rest , and uniform motion in a straight line with any velocity , were equally natural ' conditions for a material body . The principle of inertia took shape in this statement . We have spoken of local motion near the surface of the earth ' ( p. 124 ) . The title of one of Galileo 's Dialogues was , in fact , Mechanics and Local Motion , and it is just this preoccupation with terrestrial motion which prevented him from formulating the principle of inertia in its final simplicity . On a scale larger than local ' , Galileo imagined his horizontal plane ' encircling the earth along a great circle . He assumed that rest or uniform motion with any velocity , along such a plane , was equally natural . He could not know , directly from his experiments , that if the velocity of the body along the plane were greater than a limiting value the body would leave the plane and travel off into space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earth , with any velocity , as exemplifying the new principle . In this he was mistaken , but he had , at least , disproved , to his own satisfaction , the doctrine of decaying impetus , and in the modern principle of inertia Galileo 's contribution is clearly manifest . Only , now , the last relics of his earth-centred bias have been removed , and rest or uniform motion in a straight line ? anywhere in the Euclidean universe ? is taken as the natural condition for a body wholly free of influence from outside . The generalisation which we have just described first became part of an acceptable system of dynamics with Newton , but it should be stated as a fact of history that it was earlier formulated as an element in the speculative cosmology of Descartes ( see p. 70 ) , effectively as an intuitive notion , not derived from experiment , its explicit statement appearing first in The Principles of Philosophy published in Amsterdam in 1644 . And , as we have seen ( p. 114 ) , at least independently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with whose father Descartes had // corresponded during his residence in Holland ) realised very clearly that if unaccelerated motion is the norm in the absence of external force , then uniform motion in a circle is not free motion , for it is definitely accelerated . 8.2 . NEWTON 'S LAWS OF MOTION Newton had more than the experimental results of Galileo and the speculations of Descartes to build on when in 1685 he began to set out in formal fashion the elements of his own system on Halley 's instigation ( see p. 203 ) . There had been much experimenting on the collisions of hard spherical bodies moving as pendulums or on smooth horizontal planes , by Rev. John Wallis , by Sir Christopher Wren and independently by Huygens , and these three had communicated their results to the Royal Society in London in the three consecutive months of November and December 1668 and January 1669 . Also , in 1676 , Robert Hooke had published , albeit as a Latin cryptogram , his law of the deformation of spiral springs under load . Forces other than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result of Newton 's consideration of Galileo 's principle of inertia in the light of this whole body of evidence led him to introduce into physics , as we shall now describe , a new concept mass ' , closely related to weight ' , but essentially distinct from it . As long as motion under gravity alone was in question , the disentangling of these two concepts was indeed difficult in the extreme . Galileo had recognised the weight of a body as a force accelerating its motion towards the earth . The propensity of a body to fall is equal to the least resistance which suffices to support it , ' he wrote , and he knew that the less the inclination of an inclined plane the less the resistance necessary to prevent the body sliding down the plane . Stevinus had established the mathematical relation between the slope and the necessary resistance in 1586 ( see p. 142 ) , and Galileo had derived the same result by another method ( p. 165 ) when he was at Padua . He had also found , many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less , the less steeply the plane is inclined . But , when he came to put all these matters together , at the end of his long life , he missed the point that for a given body the ratio of the measures of the acceleration down the plane and the resistance necessary to prevent sliding , under ideal conditions , is constant whatever the inclination ? equal , in fact to // the ratio of the measures of the acceleration of the body in free fall under gravity and its weight . If he had seized upon this point ? if his experimental results had been sufficiently precise for it to have been immediately obvious ? he might well have been led to the concept of mass before Newton . For Newton the situation was in some degree less perplexing . The experiments on impact had shown that when two hard spherical bodies are in direct collision the ratio of the measures of the changes of velocity which they suffer , respectively , is determined by two factors , one the inverse ratio of the measures of the volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which the bodies are made . Thus , if two identical spherical bodies are in direct collision , the changes of velocity which they suffer are equal in magnitude ; if the bodies are of the same material , but the radius of the first is n times the radius of the second , then the magnitudes of the velocity changes are in proportion as 1:n3 ; finally , if the bodies are of different materials , the proportion may be written as  |p2:n3| . In this last expression , pl and  | represent the measures of the densities ' of the two materials concerned . Density ' itself is a new concept : it refers to mass per unit volume . Having indicated very briefly , as we have just done , the additional observational material which Newton had for consideration in 1685 , without further preliminaries we shall merely state the laws of motion as he formulated them , for however much we may work over the experimental results beforehand , we can not deduce the laws by rigorous argument . There is much intuition in them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the light of subsequent experience , not to be passively accepted as established on the basis of previous knowledge ? as indeed do all the laws of physics . In the next section we shall attempt their logical appraisal . Here we give a modern rendering of the original Latin . Definition 1 . Quantity of matter , or mass , is the measure of it given by the product of the measures of density and volume . Definition 2 . Quantity of momentum of a body is the measure of it given by the product of the measures of its velocity and its mass . Law 1 . Every body perseveres in its state of rest , or of uniform motion in a straight line , except in so far as it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed on it . // Law 2 . The rate of change of momentum of a body is proportional to the moving force impressed on it , and is effective in the direction in which that force is impressed . Law 3 . An action is always opposed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two bodies are always equal and act in opposite directions . We have not given Newton 's formulation here in its entirety . There were , in all , eight definitions , and to the three laws were appended six corollaries ( see p. 76 ) . But what we have given is sufficient for our immediate considerations . 8.3 . APPRAISAL OF NEWTON 'S LAWS In the Introduction to this book we made the distinction between quantitative definitions ' and laws of nature ' , pointing out that one of the criteria which a law of nature must satisfy is that the statement it might have been otherwise ' is true of it . As we have seen , Newton also made the formal distinction between definitions and laws , and it is now pertinent to enquire whether we can accept his assignments . Let us examine each of the five statements of the last section ? the two definitions ' and the three laws ' ? in turn . Newton 's first definition ' certainly leads to a quantitative specification of density , if mass is known . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three quantities involved , p = m/V , but mass itself is defined here only as the quantity of matter in a body . This statement gives no clue to the method by which mass may be measured . It has been maintained , and it may be true , that Newton held the extreme view that all matter is made up of identical elementary sub-atomic particles , differently arranged in the atoms of different substances , so that for him the quantity of matter in any body had a definite meaning in terms of the number of such particles which it contained . But this explanation does not alter the situation in respect of measurement , which is our present concern : in that connection Newton 's first definition ' is not at the same time a valid definition of both density and mass . We shall assume that , in fact , it leaves mass undefined . Newton 's second definition ' is obviously a valid definition of momentum , if mass is known . Writing P for the measure of the momentum of a body , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as yet been satisfactorily defined . Moreover , // there is nothing in the other six definitions , which have not been quoted hitherto , to clarify the concept of mass any further . We are compelled to seek such clarification in the so-called laws . Newton 's first law ' is hardly distinguishable , except in grammatical construction , from his fourth definition , which we now quote for comparison : Definition 4 . An impressed force is an action exerted on a body , tending to change its state either of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line . We are tempted to conclude that Law 1 contains nothing of importance besides that which is contained in this definition . But this is , perhaps , too hasty a judgment . Newton 's third definition may be freely translated : Definition 3 . All matter has the quality of inertia , whereby every body , so far as depends upon itself , perseveres in its state , either of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line . We are on safer ground if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated in one or other of these definitions . We may , in fact , paraphrase the law ' as follows : Law 1 ( paraphrase ) . If at any instant the velocity of a body is changing , in magnitude or direction or both , then at that instant the body is acted upon by a force having its origin outside the body . The phrase , having its origin ' is admittedly vague , but the general intention of this paraphrase is clear : Law 1 is no more than a qualitative definition of force , a specification of the circumstances in which we say there is force acting there ' . We were obviously committed to this view , once we had asserted the identity of content of Law 1 and Definitions 3 and 4 . There is nothing in any of these statements describing a characteristic of the real world which might have been otherwise , if the pattern of the universe had been different from what it is . Newton 's second law ' clearly provides the basis for a quantitative definition of force , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except that by its specification of direction it emphasises the fact that both force and momentum are vector quantities . If the unit of force is suitably chosen , the constant of proportion-I // ality in the defining equation may be made equal to unity . Then F , the measure of the mean force acting on a body in rectilinear motion , between times tl and t2 , when   and   are the respective measures of the momentum of the body , is given by figure Equation ( 47 ) , appropriately generalised for non-rectilinear motion and so as to give force-at-an-instant rather than mean force , contains the whole content of the second law ; we see that it merely carries forward the definition contained in Law 1 , giving it numerical precision . It is certainly not a law of nature as we understand that term . And we must not forget that we do not yet know how to assign a measure to momentum , for mass has not as yet been satisfactorily defined . Indeed , we have now traversed the first and second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have still to discover a true law of nature , or any further clarification of the concept of mass . The essence of Newton 's whole system of dynamics is to be found in the third law ' . Even at first sight this law appears to assert something regarding the real world , something that has been inferred from experiment , something which in its generality future experiment may confirm or deny . Here is an assertion that in general the real world has such-and-such characteristics : in fact , the world may have these characteristics , or they may be slightly different ? they could conceivably have been utterly different . We accept Law 3 as a law of nature , therefore , but to appreciate its true content we must again paraphrase . To do this we note that , according to Definition 4 , action ' is synonymous with force ' , and we translate force ' according to the definitions contained in Law 2 and Definition 2 . We note , also , that rate of change of velocity ' is acceleration ' ( ? 4.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . In an isolated system of two bodies the instantaneous accelerations of the bodies are always oppositely directed , and their magnitudes are in a constant ratio . This ratio is the inverse ratio of the masses of the bodies . We have already accepted Law 3 as a law of nature ; we now realise that , taken together with the rest of Newton 's formulation , it provides a practical definition of mass , also . Using an obvious notation , // successive steps in the argument leading to our paraphrase of the third law may be sketched thus : The ratio of the masses is the inverse ratio of the accelerations produced by equal forces . It will be noted that the third law deals specifically with the behaviour of two bodies considered in isolation from the rest of the world . Newton speaks of the mutual actions of two bodies ' , and in our paraphrase , to give added point to this limitation , we refer to an isolated system of two bodies ' . Now , in practice , there is no such thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number . And Newton gives no hint how , amidst the welter of interactions between the many bodies in the world , he is able to disentangle the mutual actions of any pair of them . These remarks merely serve to emphasise the depth of his intuition , and the magnitude of the claim which , by implication , the third law makes concerning the order of the world . In effect , the claim is as follows . If the instantaneous accelerations of all the bodies in the world ? say N of them , an astronomically large number ? could be determined at any time , there would be one way , and one way only , in which these accelerations could be resolved , each into ( N ? 1 ) components , so that the N ( N ? 1 ) component accelerations would constitute 2N ( N ? 1 ) pairs , oppositely directed along the lines joining the N bodies each to every other , the magnitudes of these paired components being such that N mass-constants , ml , m2 , . . . mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sense that ras , the measure of the component acceleration of body r towards body s , and sat. , that // of the component acceleration of s towards r , would satisfy ras/ ar=ms/mr , and similarly for all possible pairs . When the statement is truly made that Newton 's laws were in fact found adequate for the description of motions in the real world with entire fidelity over a period of more than two hundred years , it is tacitly implied that this far-reaching claim was essentially well founded . In the present chapter we have accepted the ideas of space and time , which we have discussed in some detail already , and , following Newton , we have been led to the ideas of mass and force from a consideration of the motions of bodies in the real world . We have just stated that Newton 's laws , in which these latter ideas were first expressed , proved uniformly successful as tested by experimental results over more than two hundred years , and we have pointed out that this in great measure justifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as valid concepts in relation to reality . But it should also be clear that the success of the Newtonian formulation indicates that our basic ideas of space and time are justified in like measure . We have raised doubts on this point , pointing out some of the difficulties , at various stages in our earlier discussion ( ? ? 3.1 , 3.2 , 3.5 ) . We shall not refer to these again in detail here : it will be enough to mention one of them ( p. 38 ) of which Newton himself was well aware . This is the doubt concerning the notion of absolute rest ' . It is true that Galileo , first , and Newton more systematically , later , disposed of the idea that the condition of a body absolutely ' at rest is in any way different , kinetically , from that of a body in uniform rectilinear motion . But this did not settle the philosophical difficulty , which arises from the suspicion that any statement regarding motion implies knowledge of a reference point at rest . If Newton 's laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely ' true , then there must inevitably be a standard of absolute rest in the universe . On this point Lamb has written , By " motion " we mean of necessity motion relative to some frame of reference which is conventionally spoken of as " fixed " . . . . As a first step we adopt a system of rectangular axes whose origin is fixed in the earth , but whose directions are fixed by relation to the stars ; in the planetary theory the origin is transferred to the sun , and afterwards to the mass-centre of the solar system ; and so on . At each step there is a gain in accuracy and comprehensiveness ; and the conviction is cherished that some system of rectangular axes exists with respect // to which the Newtonian scheme holds with all imaginable accuracy ' ( Encyclopaedia Britannica , 11th edition , 1911 ) . Lamb 's remarks are characteristic of the general scientific attitude at the end of the period of more than two hundred years ' to which we have already referred ? the period during which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical situation as known at the time . For the purposes of the present volume Newton 's laws remain entirely adequate today , but we have to record the fact that for the less familiar phenomena which involve very high velocities ? velocities comparable with the velocity of light ? modifications are now known to be necessary . These are the modifications introduced in the theory of relativity of Einstein . It is characteristic of this theory that a new attitude towards absolute rest is taken : effectively it is held that the notion is meaningless for the physicist ? he should rid himself of his cherished conviction ' that there is any system of axes with respect to which the Newtonian laws are absolutely ' true . At the best they are an approximation , albeit a most useful one . Having registered this caveat , we shall proceed throughout the rest of this book to accept the Newtonian laws as valid : the approximation which they represent is entirely satisfactory for our purposes . 8.4 . CONSERVATION OF MASS It is a fundamental attitude of the physicist that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until a recipe has been formulated on the basis of which a measure may be assigned to the magnitude of the corresponding physical quantity . In the last section we have concluded that Newton 's third law of motion provides that recipe in relation to the concept mass ' . The assertion of that law , as we have paraphrased it and explained its implications , is that , measured in terms of an invariable unit , the mass of any body which retains its identity throughout time remains constant . If , therefore , the physical universe consists entirely of identifiable bodies , then the total mass of the universe remains constant indefinitely . This is a statement about the universe , and , in so far as it is true , it is a law of nature . It is the first of the conservation laws , and for our purposes we accept its validity . Newton also spoke of mass as the quantity of matter in a body , and there is the suggestion ( p. 128 ) that he thought of this as expressible , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // identical sub-atomic particles making up the substance of the body . From this point of view , the law of conservation of mass implies the permanence of these sub-atomic particles through all vicissitudes , and the indestructibility of matter in general . Here we impinge on the province of the chemist . For the chemist , however , the universe does not consist of isolated bodies which are permanently identifiable : substances may be made to react so that macroscopic identity is lost ? red mercuric oxide powder has none of the obvious characteristics of the silver-grey liquid mercury and the colourless gaseous oxygen out of which it is formed . It is not surprising , therefore , that in spite of the overwhelming success of Newtonian physics , nearly two hundred years after the death of Newton chemists should still be submitting the hypothesis of the indestructibility of matter to the stringent test of precise experiment . Throughout the first hundred years of this period the dominance of earlier views was such , and the lack of accurate gravimetric analyses so nearly complete , that little progress was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1805 ? and another century had to pass before the work of Landolt showed that under favourable conditions it is possible to account for all the matter entering into a chemical reaction to within one part in ten million , the ultimate refinement of the experimental method . Though it is never possible to establish exact equality by direct observation , at this stage at least it appeared that there was no reason to doubt the mass-conservation law in respect of either physical or chemical changes . Landolt 's experimental results were published in 1908 . Three years earlier Einstein 's theory of relativity had been advanced in order to explain certain puzzling experimental results in pure physics , and to resolve a number of philosophical difficulties to which reference has already been made ( p. 133 ) . It is an interesting coincidence that during the same few years in which the chemists were finally convincing themselves that mass is indeed conserved within the accuracy of their means of estimation , experimental and theoretical physicists were demonstrating that it is not basically invariable , as Newton had supposed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every chemical reaction involves a small change of mass . We are not going to be concerned with these refinements in this book : we can safely disregard them , for the velocity-dependence of mass is appreciable only at velocities // comparable with the velocity of light , and there are not many chemical reactions in which the mass-change is as great as one part in ten thousand million ( compared with the one part in ten million of Landolt ) . 8.5 . CONSERVATION OF LINEAR MOMENTUM Newton 's third law of motion involves a second conservation law , the law of conservation of linear momentum . We may formulate this law as follows : For any isolated system of particles , the resultant compounded of the instantaneous ( linear ) momenta of the individual particles remains unchanged ( in magnitude and direction ) with the passage of time . Or alternatively : For any isolated system of particles , the instantaneous vector sum of the ( linear ) momenta of the individual particles remains constant . Linear momentum , a vector quantity , the measure of which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the product of the measures of the scalar quantity , mass , and the vector quantity , linear velocity , is such that for any particle its rate of change is the measure of the resultant force acting on the particle ( Law 2 ) . Let us begin , then , with the isolated system of two particles postulated in our paraphrase of Law 3 ( p. 130 ) . Instantaneously , the only forces that there can be constitute an equal and oppositely directed pair . These forces may change with time but at each instant they are equal and oppositely directed . In each elementary duration , therefore , the rate of increase of the linear momentum of the one particle is equal and opposite to the rate of increase of the linear momentum of the other . Over any finite time , in consequence , the change of linear momentum of the one particle exactly counterbalances the change of linear momentum of the other . For these two particles , then , linear momentum is conserved . It is a simple matter to extend this argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say N of them . In such a system the components of force consist of 2N ( N ? 1 ) equal and opposite pairs ( p. 131 ) . In any finite time the net momentum generated by any // one of these pairs of force components is zero , thus the resultant momentum of the whole system remains unchanged . And the same result is true for an isolated system of bodies , for each body may be regarded as constituted of a large number of individual particles to which Newton 's third law applies ( see , also , ? 9.6.3 ) . 8.6 . COMPARISON OF MASSES : THE BALLISTIC BALANCE Galileo 's ideal , a perfectly smooth plane surface , was one on which , when it was horizontal , and in the absence of air resistance , a body would travel freely , without change of velocity . In this case the force between the surface and the body is normal to the surface , supporting the body in opposition to its weight ( p. 126 ) . A perfectly smooth surface is incapable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any force parallel to its plane . Imagine , then , a perfectly smooth concave surface in the form of a portion of a circular cylinder of radius R , as shown in vertical section in fig. 27 , and let the cylindrical axis , passing through 0 , be horizontal and perpendicular to the diagram . Let a small body be placed on the surface at P. According to Galileo 's observations with inclined planes of various inclinations ( the present situation is novel only in that the inclination of the cylindrical surface varies continuously ) , in the ideal case the body would oscillate backwards and forwards between P and P ' ( PP ' being horizontal ) , and the speed of the body as it passed through A , the lowest point in its path , would be the same as it would have acquired in free fall from N to A. If g is the measure of the acceleration of free fall ( acceleration due to gravity ) , and v that of the velocity of the body at A , if NA = h , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure A smooth surface with complete fidelity . On the other hand , by a different arrangement , we can in fact approximate very closely indeed to the type of motion which we have just described . Suppose that our small body , instead of being constrained to move along the circular arc PAP ' by virtue of its being supported on the concave surface previously specified , is attached to a fixed support at 0 by an inextensible weightless string of length R , the concave surface being removed . Then the body must move in a circular arc as before , and the force normal to the surface in the first arrangement is replaced by a force along the string in the second . For corresponding positions of the body these forces are in the same direction in the two cases . Indeed , the motion of the body is precisely the same in the two arrangements : the same geometrical constraint is achieved throughout , thus the forces must be the same , though they are differently produced . For small vertical displacements , equation ( 49 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body at the lowest point of its motion , is proportional to x , the distance through which it is withdrawn sideways before being released , or through which it will afterwards move before coming momentarily to rest . In relation to the ideal of unresisted motion , surface resistance has been eliminated and only air resistance remains , however a new feature of complication has been introduced in the form of the string . No string , in fact , can be perfectly inextensible and I // perfectly weightless . It can only be repeated that on balance the gain is greater than the loss : the pendulum arrangement is both more convenient and intrinsically more nearly perfect than the Galilean arrangement of the concave cylindrical surface . It has been mentioned already ( p. 126 ) that many experiments on collisions were made by the two-pendulum method , notably by Sir Christopher Wren , in the period which elapsed between the publications of Galileo 's Dialogue , in 1638 , and Newton 's Principia , in 1687 . Hicks 's ballistic balance represents a refinement of the twopendulum arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initially without reference to that refinement , as follows . Let two small spherical bodies , X and Y , of masses m1 and m2 respectively , be supported with their centres in the same horizontal plane from rigid supports separated by a horizontal distance AB ( see fig. 28 ) equal to the sum of the radii of the spheres . Let the vertical distance from AB to the line of centres of the spheres be R. Let the body X be drawn aside through a horizontal distance xi ( to the left in the figure ) , let it be released , and , after collision with the stationary Y , let it move forward ( to the right in the figure ) through a horizontal distance xi ' before itself coming momentarily to rest . Similarly , let Y move through a horizontal distance x2 ' ( of necessity x2 ' x1 ' ) before it in turn comes momentarily to rest after the collision . Then , if v1 is the measure of the velocity of X before the collision , and v1 ' and v2 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the collision , respectively , and if the direction of the original motion of X is regarded as positive throughout , we have , from ( 49 ) , certainly as long as x1 , x1 ' and x2 ' are all small compared with R , figure // In the special case in which the bodies stick together on collision , obviously xi ' = x2 ' , and in this case , therefore , where x ' = x1 ' = x2 . Equation ( 51 ) , or equation ( 50 ) , provides a basis for the comparison of the masses of two spherical bodies in terms of an experiment in which the only measured quantities are the magnitudes of the sideways displacements involved . Clearly the validity of either equation is not restricted to the case of two spheres , and Hicks 's ballistic balance provides the physical conditions in which the experiment can be carried out for bodies of arbitrary shape . The ballistic balance consists of two exactly similar wooden platforms , so suspended by multifilar suspensions that they remain essentially horizontal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their opposing faces ensuring that they stick together on collision , also with means of securing on their upper surfaces the experimental bodies of which the masses are to be compared . Pointers attached to the platforms move over horizontal scales , so enabling the initial and final displacements to be easily observed . Obviously , two sets of observations are required in order that the ( equal ) masses of the platforms may be eliminated from the calculations . Thus , if , u , be the mass of either platform , an experiment in which one platform is loaded with the first body , whilst the other platform is unloaded , will enable the ratio ml/ , u. to be determined , and a similar experiment using the second body only will yield the ratio m2/ ? . The required ratio m , /m2 may then be obtained by division . Alternatively , if a graded series of reference masses is available ( ' box of weights ' ) , the two experiments might consist in the loading of one platform with , each of the experimental bodies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a selection of reference masses so chosen that x ' = 2x , , as nearly as may be arranged . Then , according to equation ( 51 ) , in each case the colliding bodies must be of effectively equal mass , that is , in each case the mass of the experimental body on the one platform must equal the total of reference masses on the other . If we imagine the reference masses to be exactly similar units of any convenient size , clearly the ratio of the masses of the two experimental bodies is given in terms of // the numbers of reference-mass units required for balance ' in each experiment . The accuracy of this comparison is determined by the patience of the observer , and by size of the reference-mass unit at his disposal . Obviously , the smaller this unit is , in relation to the mass of either experimental body , the more accurate is the best comparison that can be made with a given apparatus ? at least until the limit fixed by the accuracy in the measurement of displacement is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bodies are not generally compared by use of a ballistic balance . The method of weighing , to be discussed in the next section , is in fact susceptible of enormously greater accuracy than the method we have just described , but the concept mass ' was introduced into physics through Newton 's third law , and the ballistic balance has at least the merit that it operates primarily and essentially within the field of this law . It is true that in practice use is made of the fact that the acceleration due to gravity is the same for all bodies in a given locality ( compare equations ( 49 ) and ( 50 ) ) , but this assumption is not basic for the operation of the ballistic balance as it will be found to be for the operation of weighing using a beam balance of conventional type . 8.7 . WEIGHT Galileo recognised that , for all bodies in the same locality , the acceleration of ideally free fall is the same . He also recognised the property of heaviness , or weight , as measured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . A body supported against the action of its weight is in equilibrium under equal and opposite forces : when the supporting force is withdrawn , the weight , that is the natural force due to gravity , produces the acceleration . Accepting the quantitative definition of force provided by Newton 's second law , we have , if m is the mass of a body and W is its weight in a locality where the common acceleration due to gravity is g , W = mg ( 52 ) Equation ( 52 ) shows that we can compare the masses of two bodies by comparing their weights , or the forces necessary to support them against the pull of gravitational attraction , in the same locality on the earth 's surface . The beam balance , the operation of which we shall be considering in greater detail in a later section ( ? 9.10 ) , // provides a method of matching two bodies , or two sets of bodies , so that the forces necessary to support them are equal . We balance each experimental body in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ) , effectively in the same manner as we considered in the last section in relation to the second method of using a ballistic balance ? though by a much less tiresome and more accurate procedure . For our present purposes it need only be stated that the beam balance consists fundamentally of two exactly similar scale pans freely supported one from each end of a beam which is itself supported symmetrically so that it is free to turn about a horizontal axis at right angles to its length . The forces necessary to support the scale pans and their contents act vertically upwards through the points of attachment of the pans to the beam . Through these same points equal and opposite forces act downwards on the beam . If the beam is in equilibrium in a horizontal position when the pans are empty , one may conclude from the symmetry of the arrangement that the beam will also be in equilibrium in the same position when the pans are loaded with bodies whose weights ( and , therefore , whose masses ) are the same . The criterion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minor complication arising from the buoyancy of the air ? is , therefore , that the beam shall be in equilibrium when it is horizontal , or that in this position it shall show no tendency to tilt either to the right or the left . The experiments of Landolt to which reference was made in ? 8.4 were made with a beam balance . It was there stated that an accuracy of one part in ten million was attained in favourable circumstances . This was a particular example : it may be asserted more generally , with equal truth , that the process of weighing is intrinsically one of the most accurate of the processes of measurement in physics . In practice , therefore , whenever this is possible the masses of bodies are compared by weighing them in turn on a beam balance . In the last section we defined a perfectly smooth plane surface as incapable of generating , through contact of another body with it , any force parallel to its plane . If , therefore , a body is placed on a perfectly smooth inclined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be applied to prevent the body sliding downwards . It has been stated , in ? 8.2 , that Stevinus solved the problem of relating this force to the weight of the body in 1586. // Recognising the fact that force is a vector quantity , we should , nowadays , simply resolve the weight of the body into components , W cos 0 normal to the surface and W sin 0 parallel to the direction of steepest slope of the surface , W being the weight and 0 the inclination of the surface to the horizontal ( see ? ? 9.2 , 9.5 for full justification of this statement ) . We should note that the normal reaction on the body must be W cos 0 , since it can have no acceleration at right angles to the surface , whatever its motion parallel to it may be . And we should note that the body would have an acceleration parallel to the surface unless the weight component W sin 0 were opposed by an equal and oppositely directed external force . This situation is represented diagrammatically in fig. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for convenience only . In Stevinus 's time the procedure of resolution of vectors had not been devised , thus it is instructive to follow the argument which led him to the result which we have just derived . Stevinus considered a uniform heavy flexible band supported on a triangular prism having one face horizontal . Figure 30 represents the arrangement in principal section . Suppose that the inclined faces of the prism , represented by AC , BC in the figure , are perfectly smooth and that their inclinations are 01 and 02 as indicated . Then it is contrary to experience and to reason , Stevinus held , that , in such an ideal arrangement , the band should start to move , if it were initially at rest . Moreover , the portion of the band below the prism must hang symmetrically , so that lack of movement ( acceleration ) can not be ascribed to the balancing of forces resulting from the asymmetrical configuration of the upper part of the band ( the part lying on the inclined faces of the prism ) by forces arising from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no such asymmetry . Therefore , that part of the band actually in contact // with the prism is itself in equilibrium ; that is , the force necessary to prevent the portion in contact with CB moving down the plane , as it would do if it were unsupported , is equal to the force necessary to prevent the portion in contact with CA moving down CA , each of these forces being provided by the tension in the band at the point where it passes over the ridge of the prism . This tension can not have different values at a single point . Because the band is supposed uniform , if W1 , W2 are the weights of the portions in contact with CA and CB , respectively , of necessity , from the geometry of the triangle , figure Clearly , the force necessary to prevent motion of either portion of the band will be proportional to its weight , and will depend upon the inclination of the plane on which it rests . Further , we have just concluded that , in the arrangement considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the band resting on CA and CB , respectively . Equation ( 53 ) shows that of necessity the product figure is the same for the two portions of the band in question . This product fulfils the condition that it is proportional to the weight and dependent upon the inclination ; moreover , for a vertical plane , sin 0=1 , and in that case the product is simply the weight , as we 144 . MASS , LENGTH AND TIME know the external force necessary to prevent motion must be when the plane provides no support at all . Thus we conclude that the minimum external force necessary to prevent motion , for any body of weight W placed on a perfectly smooth inclined plane of inclination 0 , is W sin 0 , if it acts in the direction of steepest slope of the plane . At a later stage , when we come to consider the law of moments ( ? 9.4 ) , we shall show how Galileo deduced this simple but fundamental result by an entirely different argument , some few years after Stevinus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have just attempted to reproduce . It was the case in the sixteenth century , and it is even more obviously the case in the twentieth , that new results in physical science appear frequently at about the same time in different places , as the inevitable products of a ferment of ideas at work in many schools over relatively long periods of apparent inactivity . 8.8 . STANDARDS OF MASS In the last two sections we have discussed in some detail two methods of comparing the masses of bodies . On the basis of either method we have a workable procedure ; if , in addition , we specify a unit of mass , we have a complete system of mass-measurement , fully defined . In the British system , the unit of mass , the avoirdupois pound , is realised in a cylindrical standard made of platinum in 1844 and designated the Imperial Standard Pound in terms of the Weights and Measures Act , 1856 . As with the yard , the unit was given more precise definition by the Act of 1878 of the same title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its diameter somewhat less than this , and it has a shallow groove round its cylindrical surface , near to one end , for ease of manipulation , for which purpose an ivory lifting-fork is used . The edges of the standard are rounded as a precaution against damage . There are five parliamentary ' copies , as with the standard yard . In the metric system the unit of mass is the kilogramme . Following the failure of an earlier attempt to relate this unit to a volume of pure water ( p. 34 ) , the kilogramme was defined , in 1889 , as the mass of a cylindrical standard of platinum-iridium alloy , designated the International Prototype Kilogramme . The diameter of the standard is equal to its height ( just less than 4 cm. ) , and the // edges are sharp . A determination made at the National Physical Laboratory in 1933 gave the result 1 lb. = 0.453592338 kg. , a figure which we quote here chiefly as indicating a precision in weighing , in the very favourable case of the comparison of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landolt in his classical experiments on the conservation of mass in chemical reactions . With these definitions we have now completed our specification of the units of length ( ? ? 2.8 , 2.10 ) , time ( ? 3.2 ) and mass , as currently used as the basis of accurate measurement in physics . In respect of the units of length and time , we have already discussed in some detail the difficulties in the way of the satisfactory definition of the units , and their realisation in invariable standards . It might appear that , fundamentally , such difficulties are less acute in relation to the units and standards of mass . To some extent this is true : the great accuracy of which the procedure of weighing is susceptible makes possible a check on the constancy of the masses of bodies , under ordinary conditions of use , to a very high order . In so far as the Newtonian idea of mass , as the quantity of matter in a body , is valid , it is necessary only to insure that our standard of mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in order that its mass should remain constant in perpetuity . It must be protected against mechanical actions such as abrasion which would decrease , or the adherence of dust or dirt which would increase , its mass ; it must be proof against the oxidation of its surface layers which would add matter to its bulk . These requirements are obvious enough ; they explain the choice of a heavy metal capable of receiving a high polish , highly resistant to all ordinary chemical reagents , for the fabrication of the standard . And they explain why the primary standard is brought into use so infrequently ; say once in ten years for comparison with its copies . For all practical purposes the precautions and cross-checks which have been instituted are highly effective . But , as illustrating the dictum that nothing is as simple as it seems , it is worth remarking that there is one agency with which the standard-makers of the nineteenth century did not reckon , for it has been recognised only in the twentieth . Their precautions did not include shielding against the cosmic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical , point , but we now know that in any material exposed to the cosmic radiation ? and all bodies on or near the surface of the earth are so exposed , to greater or lesser K // degree ? processes occur from time to time in which atomic nuclei are transformed . To this minute ? altogether negligible ? extent the matter constituting our standards of mass does not remain for ever the same , even though they remain sealed , in vacuum , as objects of veneration rather than of use . And , as the matter of the standard is thus transformed , now one atom , now another , so , as strict purists , at least , we must believe that its mass changes . As practical scientists , however , we dismiss any doubt from our minds . Accepting 1 part in 109 as the ultimate precision of mass-comparison , we estimate that the present rate of change due to cosmicray bombardment would have to continue for more than 1010 years before its effects became manifest . These last are modern considerations ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mass , as we have referred to the history of the material standards of length , in order to make our treatment of the subject complete . For this purpose it is convenient to adopt the old sub-unit , the grain , still legally defined as 01T0 of the pound avoirdupois , as the basis of comparison . The kilogramme is about 15432.4 grains . Also , it is necessary to note that before Newton there could , strictly , be no standards of mass , though there were standard weights ' in plenty , two thousand years previously . From very early times the beam balance , in primitive form , was employed for the comparison of these weights , and for the weighing of small articles of trade , objects of gold and silver , precious stones and incense . For many centuries the assumption that by this procedure the intrinsic quantities of material were compared was intuitive rather than explicit . Moreover , with the introduction of coinage in the countries bordering on the eastern Mediterranean , in about the eighth century BC , the distinction between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become indefinite and blurred . Even today occasions for confusion still remain : in Britain the troy ounce of 480 grains ( relic of the 12-ounce troy pound of 5760 grains ) is the legal unit for the sale of the noble metals and precious stones . In Saxon times the moneyers ' pound was of approximately 5400 grains , and the troy pound , already in use for more than a century previously , succeeded this unit in 1527 . Meanwhile , in 1270 , a separate merchants ' pound of about 6750 grains was legalised , and in 1303 the avoirdupois pound was introduced for all the normal purposes of commerce . By the time of Elizabeth I the legal standard had very // closely its present value ( 7002 grains ) . In France the kilogramme replaced a pound of about 7555 grains in 1801 . The names of our units , ounce and pound , derive directly from those of the units of imperial Rome , where pounds of twelve and sixteen ounces were variously used . We shall not , however , attempt to trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will suffice to maintain that , over a period of three thousand years or more , units of about the magnitude of the pound and the kilogramme have been in common use in one dominant civilisation or another . From Egypt of the sixth century BC , Athens adopted the mina of about 6700 grains , of which the hundredth part was the drachma , and , some hundreds of years earlier , the greater maneh of the Assyrians , the equivalent of 60 greater shekels , averaged 15,500 grains on the evidence of the weights of haematite and bronze which ancient sites have yielded to the archaeologist 's spade . So little do the basic needs and inclinations of man change with the centuries . 8.9 . IMPULSE , WORK , ENERGY , POWER The fundamental concepts peculiar to the subject of kinetics are force and mass . These we have discussed in full in the previous sections of this chapter , elaborating the Newtonian scheme by which magnitudes may be assigned to the physical quantities concerned . In the course of that discussion we have also introduced momentum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal briefly with four other quantities which it is convenient to define as we develop the subject . Impulse is defined as a change of momentum . On the basis of this definition , a constant force F , acting for a time t , generates an impulse I=Ft , along its line of action ( see equation ( 47 ) ) . Obviously , it would hardly be profitable to have a separate name for this quantity , if it were not characteristic of certain situations of common occurrence . This is in fact the case : in a collision between two bodies the time over which the force acts on either body is very short , and its magnitude varies from zero at the instant of first contact , through a maximum , and back to zero again at the instant of final separation . Only the overall change of momentum is easily measured , and the magnitude of this change is the same for each body . In such a case the magnitude of the impulse generated in the collision is evidently a significant magnitude . To be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collision experience oppositely directed impulses of the same magnitude . Knowing the common magnitude of the impulse , if we can estimate the duration of the collision , we can deduce a mean value of the force developed . Because of its importance for the discussion of collision processes , the quantity impulse is frequently , though rather loosely , defined as a change of momentum produced by a large force acting for a short time . Just as the quantities momentum and impulse are measured in the same units , so the quantities work and energy are essentially of the same character . Consider the kinematic equation ( see ? 4.4 ) as it refers to the uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion of a particle of which the mass is m . Let us multiply each term of this equation by m/2 , re-arrange the terms , and attempt to interpret the equation so obtained as an equation in kinetics . The product ma , on the right-hand side of the equation , is the measure of the constant force F which must act on the particle to maintain the acceleration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 54 ) clearly represents the change in a physical quantity specified by half the product of the measure of the mass of the particle and the square of the measure of its velocity . We define this quantity as the kinetic energy of the particle , and we interpret equation ( 54 ) as indicating , in terms of this definition , that the effect of an unopposed force F , acting on a particle over a distance s , is to increase the kinetic energy of the particle by an amount of which the product Fs is the measure . Furthermore , recognising that the force F must have its origin in some physical system unspecified in our description of the situation hitherto , we say that , in the process considered , the unspecified system , through the force F , does work of which the product Fs is equally the measure . And we find it convenient to generalise this definition , and say that , when a body moves in any way under the action of any number of external forces , each force does work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measure of the distance in the direction of its line of action through which its point of application moves . // In a situation in which more than one force is involved , clearly the motion of the point of application will sometimes have a positive , sometimes a negative , component along the forwards direction of the force considered . We distinguish , therefore , between work done by a force , in the former case , and work done against a force , in the latter . When only one force is involved , equation ( 54 ) exhibits this distinction in its simplest form . When F and s have the same sign , v #@# v0 , work is done by the force , and this work appears associated with the particle as additional energy of motion . When F and s have opposite signs , v @#@ vo , the kinetic energy of the particle diminishes , and work is done against the force in amount equal to the decrease in energy . Power is defined as the rate of doing work . As we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force ' is the conventional abbreviation for the more precise expression work done through the agency of the force by the physical system in which the force originates ' . The quantity power , on the other hand , is generally regarded as an attribute of a physical system , explicitly : we speak of the power of an engine when the forces which its operation brings into play do work at a specified rate . In ? 8.3 we concluded that momentum and force are vector quantities : equally clearly , mass is a scalar quantity . The question now arises , what is the status of the quantities impulse , work , energy and power ? Obviously , impulse is a vector quantity , for it is defined as an increment of momentum . As regards work and energy , which are of the same nature , kinetic energy is given by half the product of mass and the square of a velocity . Now , mass is a scalar quantity , as we have just decided , and , in one-dimensional motion , the square of a velocity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one-dimensional motion , therefore , the direction of the velocity is immaterial when the corresponding kinetic energy is in . question , it can not be that , in three-dimensional motion , direction in space is any more involved in the specification of that energy . There is nothing , then , in the expression 2mv2 to which to attach the idea of direction , and kinetic energy is a scalar quantity . If kinetic energy is a scalar quantity , so is work , but the expression Fs represents the product of the measures of two vector quantities , force and displacement . We conclude , then , that the product of two vector quantities , in this instance , is itself a scalar quantity . As a later discussion will show , // this is not always the case when the product of the measures of two vector quantities enters as a term in an equation of physics . However , it is always the case when the physical situation is such that , for their product to be significant , the two vectors must have the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , the displacement s is measured in the direction of action of the force F : the product , giving the measure of the work done , is then spoken of as the scalar product of the vectors concerned . Work , then , is a scalar quantity , and power , which is rate of doing work , is a scalar quantity , also . Finally , to summarise the position in relation to the kinetic quantities which we have now defined , we give in tabular form the dimensions of the various quantities , and the units in which they are measured in the British and metric systems , respectively . For the metric system we give two sets of units for sake of completeness . The metric system , by past scientific usage , has generally been referred to as the centimetre-gramme-second ( c.g.s. ) system , but , as we have seen , the primary standards of length and mass are the metre and the kilogramme ? the centimetre and the gramme are strictly sub-units ? and the more directly defined metre-kilogramme-second ( M.K.S. ) system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure In the table we give the names of units only when these are individual to the quantity concerned . When no name is given it implies that the unit is specified , according to the appropriate dimensional formula , in terms of the individually named units involved . On this basis the unit of power in the British system is 1 foot poundal per second ( conventionally the foot , rather than the yard , is taken as the basic unit of length ) , and the unit of momentum on the c.g.s. metric system is 1 dyne second ( or 1 gramme centimetre per second ) . // MOMENTS OF FORCE AND MOMENTS OF INERTIA 9.1 . INDEPENDENCE OF MOTIONS OF TRANSLATION AND ROTATION In our development of Newtonian kinetics hitherto , and in particular in our discussion of the law of conservation of linear momentum ( ? 8.5 ) , we have concentrated attention on the kinetics of particles . We have stressed the generality of the Newtonian laws , and we have indicated how the motions of rigid bodies of finite extension can be treated by regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we have not as yet made effective use of this idea ; in confining our discussion to the motions of particles we have been able to avoid the problem of rotation . Ideally , the only motion of which a point-mass is capable is motion of translation . We must now deal with the motions of extended bodies , and specifically with their motions of rotation . To do this in full we must obviously consider the behaviour of rigid bodies in three dimensions , but much can be learned from considerations of twodimensional motions , and for this purpose we introduce the idea of the lamina ' , a uniform plate of arbitrary shape , of negligible thickness but finite mass , an ideal two-dimensional rigid body . In order to fix the position of a lamina in two-dimensional space , we need only specify the positions in space of two points in the lamina . Any displacement of the lamina may therefore be described in terms of the displacements of the two points concerned . As we shall see , it may also be described as compounded of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other of pure rotation . By pure translation we mean motion in which every point in the lamina moves through the same distance in the same direction ; by pure rotation the only type of motion which is possible in two-dimensional space when one point in the lamina is fixed . Let A , B ( fig. 31 ) represent the initial , A ' , B ' the final , positions in space of the two chosen reference points in a particular displacement . Let Aa , bB be drawn parallel to A'B ' , and A'a ' , b'B ' parallel to MASS , LENGTH AND TIME AB . Then , clearly , the displacement of the lamina may be described either as the purely translational displacement of AB to A'a ' followed by the clockwise rotation of A'a ' to A'B ' , or as the translational displacement of AB to b'B ' followed by the clockwise rotation of B'b ' to B'A ' . Alternatively , the order of the translational and rotational components of displacement may be reversed in the description , the translation Aa to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the translation bB to A'B ' following the clockwise rotation BA to Bb . Whichever of these equivalent descriptions is employed , the magnitude of the rotational component of displacement is the same : as a result of our construction of parallels , the four angles , LABb , LBAa , La'A'B ' , Lb'B'A ' , are obviously equal . Indeed , we may go further , we may say that this particular displacement of the lamina may be described as a pure rotation , about an identifiable point in space , of this same magnitude . In order to establish this twofold assertion let AB , A'B ' ( fig. 32 ) represent the initial and final positions of the lines joining the reference points of the lamina , as before . Join AA ' , BB ' , and let CE , DE , the perpendicular bisectors of AA ' , BB ' , meet in E. Then for // CE being the perpendicular bisector of AA ' , and BE = B'E , similarly . Thus , the displacement of AB to A'B ' may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the triangle ABE into coincidence with its congruent , AA'B'E . The first part of our assertion is thereby established : the point E has been identified , a pure rotation about which describes the displacement AB to A'B ' . In order to establish the second part of our assertion , we have to show that , if BA and B'A ' produced meet in F , so that LAFA ' ( fig. 32 ) = La'A'B ' ( fig. 31 ) , then LBEB ' =LAFA ' . We have figure // We conclude , therefore , that , for any finite displacement of a lamina in two-dimensional space , there is in general a perfectly definite finite component of rotation , of the same magnitude about whatever point in the lamina we choose to reckon it , and that there is one point , fixed with respect to the lamina , of which the initial and final positions in space are the same . If , instead of a finite displacement , we consider a displacement which is infinitesimally small , it should be clear that , whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique instantaneous velocity of translation of a moving lamina , it provides a direct and obvious basis for the definition of a unique instantaneous angular velocity of rotation of the lamina . Furthermore , it leads directly to the concept of an instantaneous centre of rotation ? the point with reference to which the infinitesimal displacement of the lamina appears as purely rotational . Following the motion of the lamina throughout a finite time , we shall in general find that the position in space of the instantaneous centre of rotation changes continuously , whilst its position in the lamina ? that is , the position in the lamina of the point which is instantaneously at rest in space ? also changes in a continuous manner . The locus in space of the instantaneous centre of rotation is generally referred to as the space centrode ' of the motion ; the corresponding locus in the lamina as the body centrode ' . At a later stage ( ? 9.5 ) we shall return to the question whether any conventional significance can be given to the concept of an instantaneous velocity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , meanwhile , having recognised the uniqueness of the rotational component in two-dimensional motion , we shall deal with motions of pure rotation . We shall consider these motions in two dimensions only , noting that there is no significant loss of generality in so doing : a solid body rotating about an axis may clearly be regarded as made up of a large number of laminae rotating with a common angular velocity . As a preliminary to this general consideration , in the next section we clarify certain aspects of the problem of the equilibrium of rigid bodies acted upon by external forces . 9.2 . SOME PROBLEMS OF EQUILIBRIUM In specifying the conditions of application of an external force to a rigid body we need to know only the magnitude of the force and MOMENTS OF FORCE AND M its line of action . It is superfluous to enquire what its point of application is . We may justify this assertion by reference to fig. 33 . Let P , Q be two points , in the rigid body represented in the figure , lying in the straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single force F acting along AB at P is obviously the same as that of three forces each of magnitude F , one acting along AB at P and the other two acting at Q , one along AB and the other along BA ( this system is indicated in the figure ) . For , in the second case , the two forces acting at Q cancel directly . But , since the body is a rigid body , so that no application of external forces can alter its shape or size , we can equally consider the force F acting at P as cancelling the oppositely directed force of the same magnitude acting at Q. In that event we are effectively left with a single force F acting along AB at Q. Our previous statement of equivalence then becomes , the effect on the body of a single force F acting along AB at P is the same as that of a single force F acting along AB at Q ( P and Q lying in AB ) ' . Thus the line of action of the external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Consider now two forces acting on a rigid body along lines which intersect . Since the points of application are immaterial , the forces may be considered as applied at the point of intersection of their lines of action . In that case the parallelogram construction may // be employed to determine their resultant . This statement remains true , in the limit , when the lines of action are parallel . We shall derive the construction for the resultant of two parallel forces by following its implications . In fig. 34 , let ABDC be the parallelogram representing the composition of two forces , Fl and F2 , of which the lines of action are represented by AB and AC , respectively . Then AD represents the line of action of the resultant , and its magnitude F is given by F2 = F12+F22+2F1F2 cos 0 ( 55 ) where /CAB= 0 , as indicated in the figure . Let / CAD = 02 , L DAB = 01 , and from P , any point in AD , let PM , PN be drawn perpendicular to AB , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 01i thus ' or F1 . PM = F2 . PN ( 56 ) In the limit , when the forces are parallel , equation ( 55 ) reduces to F = Fl the perpendiculars from P on the lines of action of the forces become collinear , and equation ( 56 ) specifies the position of the line of action of the resultant according to the new construction . Fig. 35 illustrates this construction , which we may describe in words as follows . Let parallel lines of lengths Fl and F2 be drawn representing the two forces to be compounded . Let M , N be two points , one in each of these lines , such that MN is perpendicular // to their common direction . If P is the point in MN for which F1 . PM = F2 . PN , then a line of length F1 + F2 drawn through P , and at right angles to MN , represents the resultant force as to line of action and in magnitude . In the foregoing analysis we have considered only parallel forces acting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely obvious modifications , for the case in which the forces act in opposite directions . If , in that case , F1 #@# F2 , the magnitude of the resultant is F1 ? F2 and its line of action is given by the construction illustrated in fig. 36 . Again , F1 . PM = F2 . PN . Let us review the position which we have now reached . In relation to co-planar forces acting on a rigid body we have shown that equation ( 56 ) , when appropriately interpreted , is true whether the co-planar forces are parallel or not . In order to understand this equation it is only necessary to note that , in each case considered , // P is any point on the line of action of the resultant of the forces Fl and F2 , and PM , PN are the perpendicular distances of P from the lines of action of these two forces , respectively . Moreover , reference to figs , 34 , 35 and 36 will show that , if the forces Fl and F2 are considered in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more precisely , about an axis through P perpendicular to the plane of the forces ) , the rotation-producing actions of the forces are oppositely directed . Suppose , now , that the axis through P perpendicular to the plane of the forces is fixed in space , so that the only motion of which the body is capable is rotation about this axis . Since P is a point on the line of action of the resultant of the forces Fl and F2 , the resultant passes through the axis of rotation , and the forces Fl and F2 as applied to the body can not have any rotational effect about the axis in question . Equation ( 56 ) , in fact expresses the condition of equilibrium , in respect of rotation , of a rigid body acted on by two forces in a plane at right angles to a fixed axis ? when appropriately interpreted . In this connection the most obvious interpretation is that the equation expresses the equality of the turning efforts of the forces , these efforts being oppositely directed , as we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning effort of a force F , applied to a rigid body in a plane at right angles to a fixed axis , is measured by the product Fd , where d is the measure of the perpendicular distance of the line of action of the force from the axis about which its effect is required . This product is referred to as the measure of the moment of the force ' about the axis , or simply as the torque ' . Accepting this definition , we may re-state equation ( 56 ) in words as follows : the algebraic sum of the moments of two coplanar forces about an axis at right angles to their plane is zero if that axis intersects the line of action of their resultant determined according to the parallelogram law . Now , the moment of this resultant about such an axis is obviously zero , thus the sum of the moments of the two forces is equal to the moment of their resultant , in this special case . We shall proceed to show that this statement of equality is equally true when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axis at right angles to the plane of the forces . Let AB , AC ( fig. 37 ) represent as to magnitude and line of action two forces , Fl , F2 , applied to a rigid body . Let D complete the parallelogram ABDC . Then AD represents the resultant of the forces concerned . We have AB:AC:AD=F1:F2:F , where F is the // magnitude of the resultant . Let P be any point in the plane of the figure . Join PA , PB , PC , PD . Then for the bases of all three triangles are of the same length , and the sum of the heights of the first two is equal to the height of the third . Therefore Now suppose that d1 , d2 , d represent the perpendicular distances of P from AB , AC , AD , respectively . Then this result may be re-written the common multiplier 2 having been omitted throughout . It may equally be written because the forces are represented to scale in the diagram . Obviously , on the scale of the diagram , also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we set out to prove : the sum of the moments of the co-planar forces F1 , F2 about an axis at right angles to their plane , through any point P in that plane , is equal to the moment about the same axis of the resultant of the forces as determined by the parallelogram law . This demonstration completes 16o MASS , LENGTH AND TIME the proof that our introduction of this new concept , the moment of a force , in no way violates previously established principles : the new concept is , in fact , entirely consonant with our earlier notions regarding the composition of forces . Our physical interpretation of equation ( 56 ) has to this extent been justified . 9.3 . COUPLES There is one aspect of the problem of parallel forces which we have so far avoided and must now consider . When the forces are oppositely directed and equal in magnitude , the construction of fig. 36 fails , in that it does not give a finite resultant in terms of which the joint turning effort of the forces can be estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting at infinity . We have , therefore , to estimate the turning effort of the forces directly . In fig. 38 we represent two equal forces acting in opposite directions along parallel lines separated by a distance d . Let P be any point in the plane of the forces , at distances d1 and d2 from their lines of action ( d2 #@# d1 ) . If F is the magnitude of either force , G , the sum of the clockwise moments of the forces about an axis through P at right angles to their plane , is given by G = F ( d2 ? d , ) = Fd . Thus the magnitude of G is independent of the position of P. Because of this unique result , which does not hold for parallel forces which are unequal , the system of two equal and parallel F2 // forces acting in opposite directions is given a distinctive name . Such a system is called a couple ' ( L. Poinsot , 1803 ) , and the quantity G is referred to as the moment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the direction ( not the position ) of the axis about which it acts . If this statement is taken literally , as it is intended to be , it implies that it is not necessary to specify the magnitudes of the two forces constituting a couple , or their lines of action ; only the plane parallel to which the forces act , and the product Fd ( = G ) , need be known . Consideration of fig. 39 will clarify this assertion . A represents the section of a rigid body by a plane in which forces F1 act as shown , along parallel lines separated by a distance d1 , constituting a couple of moment Fidi . Let P be a point in the line of action of one of these forces . Obviously the situation is not changed by the introduction of equal and opposite forces F2 acting at P in this line of action . Let us now group the four forces under consideration as follows : ( i ) a force F2 acting at P , downwards ' according to the diagram , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line through P , ( iii ) a parallel force F1 acting downwards ' at a distance d1 from this last force . Now combine forces ( ii ) and ( iii ) . According to the construction of fig. 36 , the resultant is a force F2 acting upwards ' along a line through Q , d2 , the perpendicular distance of P from this line , being given by We are left with two equal forces F2 , acting in opposite directions along parallel lines separated by a distance d2 , that is with a couple differently constituted from that with which we started . But equation ( 58 ) shows that the moment of the new couple is the same as that of the old , and it is obvious from the figure that its turning effect is in the same direction as that of the couple with which we started . The assertion that only the magnitude of a couple and the direction of its axis of application are significant for its full specification is to this extent justified . If , now , we assume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( through Q and at right angles to the diagram ) fixed in space , then the argument which we have just given shows that a couple of moment G about the axis of rotation of the body , by whatever external forces it is in fact applied , may be considered as arising from the action of a single force F parallel to the plane of the couple , the line of action of F being at a perpendicular distance G/F from the axis of rotation . 9.4 . HISTORY OF THE LAW OF MOMENTS By the law of moments we mean the statement that a rigid body , having one axis fixed in space , is in equilibrium under the action of external forces , if , and only if , the sum of the moments of the forces about that axis is zero . This result was well known in essence long before the concept of force was clarified in its kinetic aspects by Newton , and it is instructive to refer briefly to its history . Consideration of the problem of rotational equilibrium arose first out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this primitive , but very useful , machine ' itself , man 's conscious adoption of it developed gradually , no doubt , through his intuitive reaction to the challenge of his surroundings , through his taking what lay to hand as tools ' for his immediate tasks . Archimedes considered the theory of the lever , effectively in respect of parallel forces , in the third century BC . He realised that the turning effort of a load is proportional to the magnitude of the load and that it increases with the distance of the load from the fulcrum . He finally convinced himself that the turning effort is directly proportional to this distance ( as the modern law of moments assumes ) , but the theoretical argument by which he reached that conclusion must be carefully framed if it is not to be held fallacious , as we shall show . Let AB ( fig. 40 ) represent a perfectly rigid , weightless beam pivoted at its mid-point , P , on a fulcrum . Let equal loads W be applied to the beam , originally horizontal , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the symmetry of the arrangement , there is no sufficient reason why the beam should tilt one way or the other ( we have used this argument already in relation to the balance ? see p. 140 ) , and it may be assumed that it remains at rest . Now , said Archimedes , let the right-hand load be divided W into two equal portions Z , and let these move from their original point of application , the one towards the fulcrum and the other away from it , at equal rates . At each stage in the process these halfloads are symmetrically placed with respect to their original posiMOMENTS // FIGURE 40 tion : in this case , Archimedes maintained , they may still be thought of as acting there together , and the equilibrium is unaffected . Finally , let the process be arrested when the inwards-moving halfload is over the fulcrum . In this position it can have no effect on the equilibrium of the beam . The left-hand load W must then be exactly balanced by the right-hand half-load W at twice the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The argument may be continued : 2 may be halved again , and so on , indefinitely . Thus a load W at distance d is balanced by W at 2d , or by W at 4d , or 8 at 2 4 8d , or in general by 2 at distance 2nd . It is a short step to the conclusion that loads WI and W2 balance when their distances dl and d2 satisfy the relation Wldi= W2d2 ? and this is the expression for the law of moments for parallel forces . Archimedes 's argument is obviously highly suspect as it stands . Indeed we may refute it directly by a simple demonstration . In order to derive the law of moments Archimedes assumed that equilibrium is undisturbed by the division and separation of the two halves of one load in the way which we have described . But this is the case only if the law of moments is valid , for if d is the original distance of the undivided load , and if the turning effort is proportional to the rth power of the distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d ? x and d+ x from the fulcrum , respectively , is W and this is equal to Wdr only when r=1 . The validity of the law has been assumed in the course of its derivation , and the proof therefore fails . // There is , however , more intuitive wisdom in Archimedes 's argument than at first sight appears : suitably developed it has all the possibilities of the argument which we have given at length in an earlier section ( ? 9.2 ) . Once it has been established that the point of actual application of an external force to a rigid body is of no unique importance , any point in the line of action of the force serving equally well as a point of virtual application ( p. 155 ) , it is entirely reasonable to assume that the parallelogram law may validly be employed to obtain the resultant of two non-parallel co-planar forces applied to such a body . We could not use the law lightly in this way without some such justification , for , in relation to forces , the parallelogram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resultant acceleration of a particle in terms of its component accelerations ? and ultimately from the parallelogram of displacements of a geometrical point ( p. 74 ) . But once the scope of the law has been extended to include the case of co-planar forces acting on a rigid body ? and this is the crux of the matter ? the rest of the argument follows . By proceeding to the limit , we obtain the construction for the resultant of parallel forces so acting ( p. 156 ) , and in respect of Archimedes 's argument we have a valid reason for his assertion that the symmetrical separation of the half-loads leaves the magnitude and the line of action of their resultant unchanged . Admittedly , the truth of the law of moments is already implicit at this stage in the argument , indeed equation ( 56 ) shows that it is implicit in the parallelogram law as applied to rigid bodies itself : it is only peculiar that in Archimedes 's presentation it is not made explicit until the end . Archimedes did not , in fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lever , but there was much intuitive wisdom in his thoughts on the problem which has remained for a later age to assimilate and apply . In the treatment of ? 9.2 , briefly recapitulated in the last paragraph , the particular case of parallel forces was approached through the more general case of forces which are co-planar but inclined . Historically , the reverse sequence obtained . Archimedes considered parallel loads ; not until near the end of the fifteenth century have we any clear statement extending the law of the lever to the case in which its axis of rotation is horizontal but the lever itself is not . It was Leonardo da Vinci who enunciated the principle that in that case the turning effort of any gravitational load , or of any force applied to the lever in a plane at right angles to the axis , is given by the product of the force and the perpendicular distance of its line of action from the axis concerned . Once again , this was a generalisation based on the intuition of genius ? and a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their relation to the arts of peace and war , than was possessed by any other thinker of his age . Almost exactly a century after Leonardo enunciated the law of moments for inclined forces , Galileo applied the generalised law to the problem of equilibrium on an inclined plane . We have already referred to this application ( p. 126 ) , described here for its historical interest ? and as providing another example of the use of the principle that it is the actual constraints imposed upon a system , not the mode of their imposition , which is dynamically important ( see p. 137 ) . Let ABC ( fig. 41 ) represent , in principal section , a triangular prism having one horizontal and one vertical face , and providing in the face AB a perfectly smooth plane surface of inclination 0 , as shown . Let a body of weight W rest on this surface , being attached by a perfectly flexible weightless string to a counterpoise of weight W1 hanging vertically , parallel to the face BC . It is required to find T , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in equilibrium . Galileo imagined the triangular prism to be removed ( except for the support provided for the string at B ) and , instead , a perfectly rigid weightless rod to be introduced , attached to the body of weight W , at one end , and to a pivot at O. He assumed the // rod to be at right angles to the original position of the plane surface AB , and to be capable of rotating about a horizontal axis through O perpendicular to its length . More nearly , as 1 , the length of the rod , is increased , are the geometrical constraints imposed by the new arrangement the same as those imposed by the old . For the consideration of equilibrium conditions , infinitesimal motions only are in question , and any value of 1 is acceptable . Taking moments about the axis through 0 , we have This result , in the form W1= W sin 0 , is seen to be precisely equivalent to that of equation ( 53 ) , obtained by Stevinus in 1586 . It was in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CENTRE OF GRAVITY Each particle of a rigid body situated near the surface of the earth is subject to a gravitational force , the weight of the particle , directed vertically downwards and proportional to its mass . The weight of the whole body is the resultant of these forces : it is obviously equal to the sum of the weights of the innumerable particles constituting the body , and the procedure of ? 9.2 allows us to determine its line of action in any circumstances . In this section we shall show that , however the body is orientated in space , there is one point , fixed with respect to the body , which always lies in the line of action of its total weight . This point is referred to as the centre of gravity of the body : in all circumstances of local terrestrial motion the weight of a body may be considered as acting vertically downwards through its centre of gravity . We shall consider the matter first in relation to a lamina of arbitrary shape . Let L ( fig. 42 ) represent the lamina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of particles the relative positions of which remain fixed . Let the lamina be free to rotate about a horizontal axis through A , at right angles to the plane of the lamina and fixed in space . Take rectangular axes OX , OY , fixed in the plane of the lamina , and let the co-ordinates of A with respect to these axes be xo , yo . When the lamina is in equilibrium under gravity , let OX be inclined at 0 to the vertical as shown . In this position the algebraic sum of the moments of the weights // FIGURE 42 of the constituent particles of the lamina , about the axis through A perpendicular to its plane , is zero . Thus , if we consider the case of a typical particle , of mass m , situated at P ( x , y ) , we have , resolving its weight , mg , into components mg cos 0 parallel to OX and mg sin 0 parallel to OY , for this particle , clockwise moment of weight of particle about axis of suspension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mg sin 0 . ( x ? xo ) . For the whole lamina , therefore , dividing through by g , the common acceleration due to gravity , we obtain cos 0 . Em ( y ? yo ) ? sin 0 . Em ( x ? xo ) = 0 ( 59 ) Equation ( 59 ) , in which sin 0 , cos 0 appear in front of the signs of summation , since 0 is constant for the lamina as a whole , has two solutions . // It will be noted that the second solution is independent of 0 : we discuss it before turning to the other . Evidently , equations ( 61 ) specify uniquely the co-ordinates of a point in the lamina , in terms of the masses and positions of the constituent particles , such that the lamina is in equilibrium under gravity about a fixed horizontal axis passing through that point at right angles to the plane of the lamina , whatever the orientation of the lamina about this axis . In other words , the equations specify the co-ordinates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts whatever its orientation ( in a vertical plane ) . Equations ( 61 ) , in fact , give the co-ordinates of the centre of gravity of the lamina . It is conventional to write these co-ordinates as 9 . Turning now to equation ( 60 ) , we see that it specifies two orientations of the lamina , 180 ? apart in the complete rotation of 360 ? about an axis of suspension through an arbitrary point A ( not the centre of gravity ) , in which the lamina is in equilibrium . For , if we substitute Emx = xEm , Emy =9-Ern , in this equation , dividing through by Em , we have figure In this case , if G is the position of the centre of gravity ( fig. 43 ) , and if AN , NG are parallel to OX , OY , respectively , equation ( 62 ) implies either The first solution imposes the condition that G shall be vertically below A , the second the alternative condition that G shall be vertically above A , if the lamina is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of our analysis . We have located the centre of gravity in the case of a two-dimensional rigid body , and we have obtained the general result that such a body will be in equilibrium about a fixed horizontal axis at right angles to its plane if the centre of gravity of the body lies anywhere in a vertical line intersecting that axis . Equation ( 6o ) represents the two cases in which the centre of gravity is ( a ) below , ( b ) above , the axis ; equations ( 61 ) the case in which the centre of gravity lies in the axis . These are , respectively , configurations of stable , unstable and neutral equilibrium . In order to locate the position of the centre of gravity of a threedimensional rigid body analytically , we proceed exactly as we have just done , concentrating attention on the orientation-independent solutions of three equations , of the form of equation ( 59 ) , having reference to equilibrium about three mutually perpendicular axes through an arbitrary point in the body , and we obtain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We obtain this result , in fact , from any two of the three equations of equilibrium . ) Although we have been led to equations ( 63 ) from a realisation that there is a single point in a body through which its weight always acts , so that the term centre of gravity ' provides an appropriate designation for this unique point , yet it will be observed that only masses and distances enter into the equations in question . This leads us to suppose that the centre of gravity of a body ? or indeed of a system of discrete particles , if equations ( 63 ) can be applied to such a system ? has further properties of a more general nature which merit investigation . We shall find that this is , in fact , the case . In relation to these more general properties the term centre of mass ' is to be preferred to centre of gravity ' for reasons that will be obvious . Consider a single external force F applied to a rigid body of mass // // M along a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We may reverse our previous argument and say that the force F may be resolved into an innumerable number of components , all parallel to its direction of application , so that each particle of which the rigid body is constituted is acted on by a component of F proportional to its mass . In that case it is clear that the effect of the applied force is to produce , for each particle of the body , a common acceleration of magnitude F/M , and so for the body as a whole . Any external force of constant magnitude and direction applied to a rigid body , initially at rest , along a line passing through the centre of mass of the body produces , therefore , uniformly accelerated rectilinear motion , without rotation , just as the force of gravity does near the surface of the earth . Suppose , now , that an external force F is applied to a rigid body , initially at rest , along a line which does not pass through the centre of mass . Fig. 44 represents the situation in the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre of mass , G. The situation is unaltered by the introduction of equal forces F acting through G in opposite directions along the line parallel to the line of action of the external force actually applied to the body . One of these forces , taken together with the external force , constitutes a couple , the other , of the same magnitude and direction as the external force , acts through the centre of mass . We have ' decomposed ' the externally applied force into an equal and parallel force acting through the centre of mass of the body , and a couple acting in the plane containing the line of action of the applied force and the centre of mass . Imagine , now , the applied force to act for a very short time . The body will suffer an infinitesimal displacement parallel to the plane just specified ( the plane represented in fig. 44 ) . We have already concluded ( p. 154 ) that , from the point of view of kinematics , such a displacement has a unique component of pure rotation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have specified the position in the body of the axis about which the component of rotation is reckoned . As a result of our present discussion , on the other hand , we have just seen that , from the point of view of kinetics , there is in this case a unique component of pure translational displacement , also . It is the pure translation resulting from the action through the centre of mass , for the short time in question , of a force equal and parallel to the external force applied . That force may be decomposed in any number of ways into a single force and a couple , but if we are to associate the single force with a component displacement of pure translation , and the couple with a component displacement of pure rotation , as we should naturally wish to do in the present case , only one of these decompositions is relevant ? it is the one in which the single force acts through the centre of mass , and which we have already described . It is important to note that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clearly , if the moment of the couple resulting from the relevant decomposition of the applied force were other than unique , its association with a uniquely specified component displacement of pure rotation would be wholly incongruous . We have just referred to the association ' of a single force acting through the centre of mass of a rigid body with a pure translational displacement , and of a couple with a pure rotation . We already know the character of the association in the first instance ? a force F acting through the centre of mass of a body of mass M for a short time t produces a pure translational displacement of magnitude 2(F/M)t2 ? in the next section we shall have to discuss the character of the association in the second instance , also . Meanwhile we may state the general conclusion : so far as the translational motion of a rigid body is concerned , whatever external forces act on it may be considered as acting through the centre of mass , whereby they may be replaced by a single resultant force determining the translational motion completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pure rotation . We have decided already ( p. 149 ) that kinetic energy is a scalar quantity . The total kinetic I74 MASS , LENGTH AND TIME axis about which the acceleration is effective , and of length proportional to its magnitude . Angular acceleration is therefore a vector quantity ? to be precise , an axial vector ? and torque is therefore a quantity of the same character . In relation to our present problem , in particular , the torques of the resultant forces , acting on the individual particles of the rigid body concerned , all have the same axis , and the same direction along that axis , and may therefore be added arithmetically . We then have figure where I is the moment of inertia of the body about the fixed axis through A. At this stage in our argument the quantities F and F ' have been . specified only in terms of Newton 's second law . It is now necessary to relate them to the external forces applied to the body in any actual situation . In general , the solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our present purposes , however , a very simple result emerges without detailed calculation . To the resultant force on any particle of the body there must contribute ( a ) internal forces arising from the mutual actions of the individual particles of the body , ( b ) components of the external forces applied to the body . According to Newton 's third law , the forces under ( a ) may be grouped into equal and oppositely acting pairs , when the whole body is concerned . Therefore these forces contribute nothing to the quantity EFr . Concerning the forces under ( b ) , they have been described as the components of the externally applied forces . Now it is axiomatic ( p. 158 ) that the sum of the moments of component forces about any axis should equal the moment of their resultant about the same axis . Thus the quantity EFr in equation ( 64 ) reduces to the sum of the moments of the externally applied forces about the fixed axis ' ? and the equation shows that this quantity , which we shall denote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple , p. 160 ) , determines the angular acceleration of the body about that axis , in terms of the associated moment of inertia , in a manner exactly analogous to that in which a force determines the linear acceleration of a particle in terms of its mass . In this connection we compare the equation G = la with the earlier equation F = ma. // The comparison gives added weight to our previous remarks ( p. 172 ) concerning moment of inertia as the rotational analogue of mass . Equation ( 64 ) has been deduced in respect of the motion of a rigid body having an axis fixed in space . In ? 9.5 we considered the initial displacement of a rigid body free to move under the action of an arbitrarily applied force . We decomposed that force into an equal and parallel force acting through the centre of mass and a couple acting in the plane containing the line of action of the applied force and the centre of mass . We gave an expression for the component displacement of pure translation arising from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are now in a position to complete the solution of the problem , using equation ( 64 ) to calculate the angular acceleration of the body about the axis through the centre of mass and at right angles to the plane of the couple , and equation ( z2 ) to deduce from this acceleration the component displacement of pure rotation about this axis . For convenience of reference we give the full solution below , repeating the expression for the translational displacement quoted earlier . As before , we denote the measure of the applied force by F , the mass of the body by M , and the short time by t . I is the measure of the moment of inertia of the body about the axis through the centre of mass at right angles to the plane containing the line of action of the applied force and the centre of mass , and d the measure of the perpendicular distance of the centre of mass from this line . Then component displacement of pure translation = I(F/M)t2 , component displacement of pure rotation = 2(Fd/I)t2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction of the applied force , the second is in the appropriate direction about the axis specified . 9.6.3 . Conservation of angular momentum . When a rigid body is completely isolated , so that no external forces act on it , clearly any velocity of translation , which the centre of mass may have initially , is maintained indefinitely . This result is consonant with the principle of conservation of linear momentum which we have already discussed ( ? 8.5 ) . Also , the sum of the moments of the I76 MASS , LENGTH AND TIME external forces about any axis through the centre of mass of the body is obviously zero . In that case the angular acceleration of the body about such an axis is zero and , therefore , the corresponding angular velocity is constant . If the body is initially rotating with angular velocity w about an axis through the centre of mass , and if I is the moment of inertia of the body about this axis , in the conditions specified the product Iw remains constant with the passage of time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quantity of which Iw is the measure is referred to as the angular momentum of the body about the axis in question . Denoting this measure by II , we have , in the previous notation , H = 2Jmr2w = Em(rw)r = Zmvr , v being the instantaneous component of velocity of the particle of mass m situated at a distance r from the axis of rotation , due solely to the rotation of the body about the given axis . If we consider a system of particles , rather than a rigid body , we may still usefully define the total angular momentum of the system about an axis fixed in space . In this case we adopt the notation H = L'mv'p ( 65 ) in order to emphasise the fact that the velocities of individual particles are no longer tangential to circles centred in the axis concerned and at right angles to it . Instead , these velocities are arbitrarily directed , and for each particle , therefore , we first resolve its velocity into components v " parallel to the axis and v ' at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perpendicular distance from the axis to the direction of the latter component . The total angular momentum of the system about the fixed axis is then given in terms of the masses of the particles , and the measures of v ' and p for each , according to the equation . Suppose , now , that the system of particles is isolated , so that no external forces act on it . The internal forces occur as equal and oppositely directed pairs acting between pairs of particles . Consider one such pair of forces . The line along which the forces act ( in opposite directions ) is arbitrarily located with respect to the axis of reference . If the forces are resolved in directions parallel and at right angles to this axis , the latter components will themselves be equal and will act in opposite directions along parallel lines in a plane parallel to the axis of // reference . The components of momentum at right angles to the axis which the forces generate in any short interval of time in the particles concerned will therefore be equal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply to them , namely the distance of the axis from the plane parallel to it which we have just identified . In the short interval of time considered , the action of this pair of forces will in consequence add nothing to the value of H specified in terms of equation ( 65 ) . And similarly , for all pairs of internal forces : these mutual actions leave unchanged the total angular momentum of the system about any axis fixed in space . This is the principle of conservation of angular momentum in its full generality . For particles whose initial positions and velocities are co-planar there is clearly no need to distinguish between v and v ' : in that case , if H is the total angular momentum of the system about any axis at right angles to the plane of motion , we have ) S being the measure of the instantaneous areal velocity ( see ? 4.6 ) of the particle of mass m about the axis in question . 9.6.4 . Vector products . In ? 8.9 we concluded that work is a scalar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity . Now , the measure of each of these quantities is given by the product of the measures of a force and a distance . The amount of work performed by any force is determined by the distance which the point of application of the force moves in the direction of the force ; the moment of a force about an axis ( torque ) by the distance perpendicular to the direction of the force between its line of action and this axis . Force and distance are , both of them , vector quantities ; the difference in the two situations is in the relative directions of the vectors the product of the measures of which determines the measure of the physical quantity which arises from their association . When two vectors are collinear the product of their measures , if it is physically significant , is the measure of a scalar quantity ; if the directions of two vectors are mutually perpendicular , subject to the same proviso , the product of their measures is the measure of a vector quantity the direction of which is at right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane of these vectors . The physical quantities torque and areal velocity belong to this latter class , and , on the basis of equation ( 66 ) , so does angular momentum . Angular velocity and angular acceleration , though they do not arise explicitly as vector products , have the same vectorial character . In order to emphasise the difference in vectorial character between work and torque it is preferable to use different designations for the units in which they are measured . Thus , in the c.g.s. metric system , the unit of work is the erg , the unit of torque the dyne centimetre . On the other hand , the dimensions of the two quantities are clearly the same , namely , ML2T ? 2 : this is an obvious case in which the principle of dimensional homogeneity ( ? 4.4 ) is not sufficient criterion of the admissibility of a mathematical equation as physically significant . It would not , in any situation , be significant physically to add together the measures of a quantity of work and a torque . 9.6.5 . Moments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practical purposes the idea of a structureless solid body is more useful than that of a rigid body constituted of individual particles on which we have so far based our discussions . We give here , therefore , expressions for the moments of inertia of certain symmetrical and homogeneous solid bodies about their axes of symmetry . The results which we quote may be derived by straightforward application of the calculus ; as quoted , rather than derived , they constitute Routh 's rule ( E. J. Routh , Rigid Dynamics , 1860 ) . Three representative solid bodies are in question : they are the rectangular parallelepiped , the elliptical lamina and the ellipsoid . We are concerned with the moments of inertia about axes through the centre of gravity in each case . In the case of the rectangular parallelepiped there are three axes of symmetry , parallel , respectively , to the three sets of mutually perpendicular edges of the figure . If these edges have lengths 2a , 2b , 2c , the moments of inertia about the corresponding principal ' axes are ( equation ) being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the elliptical lamina we consider first the axis through its centre at right angles to its plane . If 2a , 2b are the lengths of the major and minor axes of the ellipse , the moment of // inertia about the perpendicular axis of symmetry is , if the mass of the lamina is M. The moment of inertia about the major axis of the ellipse is Mb2/4 , and that about the minor axis Ma2/4 . For the ellipsoid , the axes of symmetry are the longest and shortest diameters and the diameter at right angles to these two . If 2a , 2b , 2c are the lengths of these diameters , the moments of inertia about them are , respectively , M being the mass of the ellipsoid . Routh 's rule provides the special cases ' referred to at the head of this sub-section . The general theorems ' with which we shall be concerned are two in number , and , although they , also , are most frequently applied in respect of structureless solid bodies , they do not depend for their validity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider them accordingly . The two theorems in question are usually referred to as the lamina theorem ' and the theorem of parallel axes ' . The lamina theorem states that , if , through any point in a lamina , rectangular axes OX , OY are taken in the plane of the lamina , and if OZ is perpendicular to this plane through the same point , then Ix , Iy , IZ , the moments of inertia of the lamina about the three axes concerned , satisfy the equation This result is obvious once the quantities Ix , II are expressed , in terms of the masses of the individual particles and their twodimensional co-ordinates , according to the definition of ? 9.6.1 . We have , in this way , thus r being the distance of any particle from 0 , and in consequence its perpendicular distance from OZ . The theorem of parallel axes is a little less obvious , as formally expressed . It states that if I is the moment of inertia of a rigid body about any axis , and if the moment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre of mass is IG , then M being the total mass of the body and d the separation of the two axes concerned . Igo MASS , LENGTH AND TIME Let G ( fig. 46 ) represent the centre of mass of the rigid body and OZ , GZ ' the parallel axes about which the moments of inertia of the body are I and IG , respectively . Let OX , OY be rectangular axes perpendicular to OZ , and GX ' , GY ' be parallel to these axes . Let the co-ordinates of a typical particle of the body be ( x , y , z ) referred to the axes OX , OY , OZ , and ( x ' , y ' , z ' ) referred to the axes GX ' , GY ' , GZ ' . Then , if the co-ordinates of G referred to the former axes are ( x , 9 , z ) , we have figure Also figure thus , substituting for x and y , Now , the co-ordinates of the centre of mass referred to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 0 , 0 , 0 ) , thus Zmx ' = 0 , Emy ' = 0 , and we have in the former notation , establishing the required result . 9.7 . TORSIONAL OSCILLATIONS It is an experimental fact , which we shall consider in greater detail in Chapter 16 , that the torque necessary to twist a cylindrical rod or filament about its cylindrical axis is , in very many cases , directly proportional to the angle of twist over a considerable range . If a cylindrical metal wire , firmly held at its upper end in a rigid // support , hangs vertically , carrying at its lower end a cylindrical drum or pulley , coaxial with the wire , to which a couple may be applied in the form of equal and oppositely directed horizontal forces , it will generally be found that the system reaches equilibrium when the angle turned through by the lower end of the wire is directly proportional to the moment of the couple applied . In such a situation the wire itself is in equilibrium under the joint action of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end and an equal and oppositely directed couple brought into play in the material of the support , and the drum or pulley is in equilibrium under the joint action of the applied couple and an equal and oppositely directed restoring ' couple generated in the wire due to its deformation . We conclude that , in such a case , whenever the wire is deformed in this particular way , that is , twisted about its cylindrical axis , a restoring couple is brought into play which is directly proportional to the total angle of twist over a considerable range . Let us assume , therefore , that a metal wire , supported as just described , and having the properties indicated , carries at its lower end a rigid body , firmly attached to the wire , the position of the centre of gravity of the body being such that the wire hangs vertically . Let us consider the free motion of rotation of the body about the axis of the wire . Let B be the measure of the instantaneous angular displacement of the body about this axis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple , G , is zero . If I is the moment of inertia of the body about the axis of rotation and a is the instantaneous angular acceleration , we have ( see equation ( 64 ) ) G = ? B = ? la , ? being the constant relating the twist to the restoring couple for the wire in question . The minus sign implies that the direction of the restoring couple is that of decreasing displacement . Thus a = ? ( p-/I ) O ( 69 ) Equation ( 69 ) , specifying an angular acceleration directed towards a position of equilibrium and directly proportional to the angular displacement , is characteristic of simple harmonic motion in angle ( compare equation ( 38 ) ) with periodic time T given by // This , then , is the motion which the suspended body would execute , in the case considered , if it were initially displaced through an arbitrary angle about the axis of the wire , and subsequently released . For obvious reasons , such motion is referred to as torsional oscillation ' . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment of inertia , about an axis through the centre of gravity , of a body of arbitrary shape . For , if Tl is the period of torsional oscillation of such a body , when rigidly attached to the end of a vertical torsion wire ' so that the axis in question is also the axis of the wire , and T2 is the period of oscillation of a rectangular inertia bar ' of mass M about a principal axis , when similarly attached to the same torsion wire , we have , in terms of equation ( 70 ) and Routh 's rule , figure I being the required moment of inertia of the experimental body , and a and b the half-lengths of the other two principal axes of the bar ( see p. 178 ) . Clearly , the moment of inertia of the body about any axis whatsoever can be deduced by use of equation ( 68 ) , if the moment of inertia about a parallel axis through the centre of gravity has first been determined by the method of torsional oscillation as just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is capable of free motion under gravity about a fixed horizontal axis , is referred to as a pendulum ' . An ideal simple pendulum ' is constituted of a massive bob ' of infinitesimally small size attached by a massless , inextensible , string ' to a perfectly rigid support . Physical systems which may be realised in practice in some cases approximate fairly closely to this ideal , but , quite obviously , the precise specifications here given can never be fully satisfied . It is preferable , therefore , to consider first a pendulum of arbitrary shape , and later to derive the properties of a practical simple pendulum from the more general results valid for all rigid bodies in pendulum motion . A ( fig. 47 ) represents a plane section of a rigid body , capable of free rotation about a horizontal axis through 0 , the plane of section being at // right angles to this axis and passing through G , the centre of gravity of the body . In the position shown , OG makes an angle 0 with the vertical OZ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its weight Mg acts vertically downwards through G , and this is the only force producing torque about the axis . In terms of equation ( 64 ) , therefore , I being the moment of inertia of the body about the axis of suspension , a the angular acceleration about this axis , and h the measure of the distance 0G . For sufficiently small values of 0 , sin e e does not differ significantly from unity , thus , for small values of 0 , to a good approximation , and we conclude , as in ? 9.7 , that the pendulum motion of the system is simple harmonic in angle , provided the angular amplitude is small . In that case , the periodic time , T , is given by If the angular amplitude is in fact 0 , more detailed treatment of the problem , first carried out by D. Bernoulli in 1747 , shows // that the periodic time is longer than is given by equation ( 71 ) in 02 the ratio ( 1 + 16+ ? ? . ) : 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , equation ( 71 ) underestimates the periodic time by 1 part in 1600 . This is , for most purposes , a negligible error : it is completely negligible in relation to the celebrated observations which the young Galileo made in the cathedral at Pisa in 1581 . Shortly after he had matriculated at the university there , at the age of seventeen , Galileo was watching a lamp swinging in the cathedral , and he noticed , with some amazement , that as the amplitude of the oscillations died down the periodic time remained constant . On that occasion he had only his own pulse against which to time the oscillations , but later he verified his conclusions in the laboratory and in so doing established empirically for the first time that there can occur in the world periodic motions of which the observed period is independent of the amplitude . We have already seen ( ? 6.2 ) that this independence is an essential characteristic of simple harmonic motion in general : it is an interesting reflection to note that it was first recognised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly simple harmonic . We need make only one further comment on the general situation . Galileo 's pendulum motion died down because of air resistance . In our treatment of the problem we have paid no attention to the effect of the surrounding air . The expression for the angular acceleration on which our conclusions are based describes motion which once started goes on for ever : it exemplifies the physicist 's habitual procedure of idealising his problems . In practice the motion of a pendulum oscillating in air is determined by factors other than those we have described . The weight of the pendulum is opposed by the buoyancy of the surrounding air , the motion of the pendulum is resisted because of the viscosity of the air ( see Chapter 13 ) ? and it is characteristic of such action that the air in the immediate neighbourhood of the pendulum participates in greater or less degree in the motion of the pendulum . All these effects are capable of detailed study and their nature is now well known . A theory which takes account of all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two main reasons . First , the reason at which we have already hinted ? the desire to elicit the fundamentals of a physical situation through the process of idealising it ; secondly , because in practice the neglect of these // effects is justified by the smallness of the error which it occasions . We may approach the truth more closely if we say that our concern throughout this section is with pendulum oscillations in vacuum . Then , at least , effects due to the surrounding air are eliminated by definition ' . Let us consider now a practical simple pendulum , of which our only remaining idealisation is the assumption that the string ' is entirely massless , rigid and inextensible . If the bob is spherical , and of radius r , and if 1 is the distance from the point of support to the centre of the bob , we have , in terms FIGURE 48 of equation ( 71 ) , equation ( 68 ) , and Routh 's rule , I= 5Mr2+Ml2 , h=l , therefore . For an ideal simple pendulum , r/l- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equation ( 72 ) is valid for oscillations of the smallest angular amplitude only , as is equation ( 71 ) , and the form of the correction term is the same in the two cases . There is this difference , however , that with a simple pendulum , having a flexible string , compensation can be made automatic so that ultimately no correction is necessary . A little consideration of equation ( 72 ) will show that the increase of period with amplitude could be counteracted if the effective length of the pendulum could be made to decrease as its angular displacement increased . Figure 48 indicates in principle , how this result may be achieved . It is supposed that the plane of the figure represents the plane of oscillation of the simple pendulum OG , and that symmetrically shaped jaws ' , A , A ' , are rigidly fixed , one on each side of 0 , so that , as the pendulum swings , the string wraps itself first on to one curved jaw and then on to the other . At any stage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the free length of string ( measured , of course , to the centre of the spherical bob ) . This certainly decreases as the displacement increases , thus the remaining problem is ( 72 ) // merely to calculate the geometrical form of the jaws . We shall not attempt the calculation here : the result is that the form is cycloidal , the portion AOA ' being that part of a cycloid , the generating circle of which has radius 1/4 , lying on either side of a cusp . A simple pendulum oscillating between compensating jaws of this specification is referred to as a cycloidal pendulum : not only are the the jaws cycloidal , but the centre of the bob describes an arc of an equal cycloid as the pendulum swings . The prescription which we have just given for the compensating jaws was originally given by Huygens . It is one of the many great achievements described for the first time in Horologium oscillatorium in 1673 ( see also pp. 114 , 188 ) . For an ordinary clock pendulum , constituted of a rigid metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , approximate compensation can be achieved by suspending the pendulum by a short piece of flat watch spring as indicated in fig. 49 . Flexure of the spring , as the pendulum swings , has the same general effect of reducing the length , to an extent which increases with increasing displacement . We return now to the further consideration of a pendulum of arbitrary shape . If IG is the moment of inertia of such a pendulum about an axis through the centre of gravity parallel to the axis of suspension , and if IG=MkG2 , equation ( 71 ) may be written Also , if we define a quantity 1 , the length of the ideal simple pendulum having the same periodic time T , by the equation Considering ho as given , that is , restricting our consideration to oscillations of a particular pendulum about all possible axes which are parallel to a specified axis through the centre of gravity , equation ( 73 ) can be interpreted from two points of view . In the first place , taking h as the independent variable , and 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 73 ) shows how the periodic time // varies with the distance of the axis from the centre of gravity . Figure 50 indicates the general nature of this variation . For values of h very small compared with kG , to a first approximation l= kG2/h , thus l  --  oo as h-*0 ; for values of h very large compared with kG ( such values may not , of course , correspond to possible positions of the axis of suspension ) , l- ? h . From the second general viewpoint , Z may be regarded as the independent variable in equation ( 73 ) , and h as the dependent variable . Then the equation shows , and fig. 50 demonstrates the same result graphically , that , for any value of 1 ? that is , for any specified periodic time ? there are in general two possible values of h , the distance of the axis of suspension from the centre of gravity of the pendulum . If we denote these two values by h1 , h2 , we have When kG is given , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ + h2 can not be less than 2kG ( when h1= h2 = kG ) , so that the periodic time of pendulum oscillation can not be less than 21/2k0/g in this case . 9.9 . KATER 'S PENDULUM We have just shown that , for a compound ' pendulum ( this is the name generally given to a rigid body of arbitrary shape capable of pendulum oscillations ) of which the period of oscillation about // a particular axis is T , it is generally possible to find other axes parallel to the first , but at a different distance from the centre of gravity of the pendulum , about which the period of oscillation is also T. Moreover , equation ( 74 ) shows that in general one of these axes will be so located that its distance from the first axis is equal to 1 , the length of the ideal simple pendulum of which the period is likewise T. In that case the distance between the first and second axes is related to the common periodic time T in terms of equation ( 72 ) . Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this simple relation may become applicable . As in fig. 47 , A represents a plane section of a compound pendulum through G , its centre of gravity , and we are concerned with axes of suspension at right angles to this plane of section . In respect of such axes , that is , in relation to the corresponding value of ka , C1 and C2 are the portions , within the plane section A , of circles of radii hl , h2i calculated on the basis of equation ( 73 ) with 1= T2g/477-2 . This construction ensures that the period of oscillation of the pendulum , about any axis through C1 or C2 and perpendicular to the plane of section , has the same value , T. Let one such axis cut the section in 01 . We identify this with the first ' axis of our former statement . The other ' axes parallel to this , and at a different distance from G , about which the period is also T , are those which cut the section in points lying in C2 . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 02 , is distant 1 from the first axis . In relation to fig. 51 the obvious final condition is that 02 lies in O1G produced . The prior condition , O1G O2G , has already been imposed in terms of the definition of C1 and C2 . The property of the compound pendulum which we have just discussed was originally described by Huygens in 1673 . It was first put to practical use by Captain Henry Kater ( 1777-1835 ) in 1818 , in a classical determination of the acceleration due to gravity in London . Using a bar pendulum with fixed knife-edges , Kater adjusted the position of the centre of gravity of the pendulum by altering the distribution of mass along its length , until the periods of oscillation about the two knife edges were the same to about 1 part in 105 . An accurate measurement of the separation of the knife edges and of the common periodic time allowed the acceleration to be calculated from equation ( 7z ) , correction being made for the effects of the buoyancy of the air and of the finite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kater 's pendulum was examined in great detail by the German astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel ( 1784-1846 ) in 1826 , and as a result two suggestions were made which were later adopted in practice with considerable advantage . In the first place , Bessel pointed out that it was unnecessary to follow through the extremely tedious procedure of equalisation of periods to the length which Kater had done . He showed that , if the periods of oscillation about the two knife edges were adjusted to near equality , a sufficiently accurate value of the acceleration could be calculated , provided the position of the centre of gravity of the pendulum could be determined , as a subsidiary datum , with only moderate precision . This could obviously be done by balancing the pendulum on a fixed horizontal fulcrum , and measuring the distance of each of the knife edges from this fulcrum when the directions of all three were parallel . We may justify this modification of procedure as follows . Let T1 , T2 be the nearly equal periods of oscillation about the knife edges , the distances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are h1 , h2 . Then we have or // Comparison of equation ( 76 ) with the simple-pendulum equation which Kater employed , namely , shows the very small change in actual experimental procedure which is involved . Because Ti and T2 are nearly equal , the second term on the left-hand side of equation ( 76 ) is a correcting term only ; h1+h2 on the right-hand side of this equation represents the same physical measurement ? the distance between the knife edges ? as does 1 in equation ( 77 ) ; even more obviously , the same procedure of accurately timing the oscillations about each knife edge in turn is required for the determination of ( T12+ T22 ) /2 in the one case as for the determination of T2 in the other . The one difference is in respect of the correcting term itself . In this connection suppose that the periods are adjusted to equality to within 1 part in 103 , rather than 1 part in 105 as Kater laboriously achieved , and that h1 , . - 2h2 . Then a little consideration will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part in 102 will ensure that the overall uncertainty , which adoption of the less rigorous procedure has introduced into the final value of g , is less than 2 parts in 105 , the accuracy of the basic measurements of time and of distance between the knife edges being assumed unaffected by the change . In order to attain an accuracy of 1 part in 102 in h2 , in the circumstances which we have postulated , it is necessary to know the position of the centre of gravity of the pendulum to 1 part in 300 of the distance between the knife edges . This is evidently a very modest requirement for a pendulum of normal length , for which h1 + h2 - 100 cm . We see , therefore , that the modified procedure
