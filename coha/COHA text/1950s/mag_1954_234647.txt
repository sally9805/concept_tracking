Neutral Switzerland has played host to many of history 's most serious international wrangles , but none of them was as chockful of noisy discord as the international meeting which drew to a roaring close last week in Bern 's Wankdorf Stadium . Before 55,000 wildly yelling fans , teams from 16 different countries wound up the international competition for the Jules Rimet Cup , the world 's highest soccer prize . <P> Contested every four years , the Rimet Cup in prewar years used to travel between Latin America and Italy . In 1950 Brazil got into the finals but lost out to Uruguay . Brazil promptly went into a week of mourning . This year the Brazilians were out to cop the cup . The team they had to beat : the lithe and husky Hungarians , 1952 Olympic champions and the hottest team out of Budapest since the Gabor sisters . <P> Party Line . Hungary , once a limp wrist in international competition , climbed to prowess because the Sports Ministry in Budapest 's postwar Communist regime has stuck sternly to the party line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the politicians ride herd on the sportsmen to whip them into smooth teamwork . State doctors from the Institute for Sport Hygiene check up on training , state coaches work overtime to turn out well-drilled scoring machines . The fine eleven beat Britain 's best in Budapest last May , soon after breezed into Bern and swept easily into the quarter finals for the Rimet Cup . Last week the Hungarians came up against the supercharged Brazilians . <P> On a rain-drenched field , the purple-shirted Hungarians got off to a fast two-goal start . Then the game warmed up . A flying block by Hungary 's Mihaly Lantos turned the game into a brawling , freestyle wrestling match . Toward the end of the game , Hungary 's Joseph Bozsik ( an M.P . in his spare time ) started trading punches with Brazil 's Newton Santos . Stubbornly impartial , English Referee Arthur Ellis threw both men out of the game . After that the two teams spent as much energy booting each other about the field as they spent on the ball . In the last few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the nets for a field goal . It did not add to the score , heartwarming as the effort was , and Hungary won , 4-2 . <P> Consolation Prize . The hot-tempered Latins did not take kindly to the defeat or the roughness . While Referee Ellis was rushing out of the stadium with a bodyguard of 20 Swiss police , a Brazilian player , as the Hungarians later told it , came forward to shake a friendly Hungarian hand . The two were still clasping hands when the Brazilian added a neat left to the chops . The Hungarian fell . The Brazilians insisted that it really began minutes before , when Hungarian Captain Ferenc Puskas hit Brazil 's Joao Pinheiro in the face with a pop bottle . However it started , the fight swirled through the locker rooms , and players , spectators and officials got in licks with bottles , furniture , glass from shattered partitions and the toe-ends of good solid soccer boots . Swiss gendarmes surrounded the locker room , but for a while all they could do was keep out reinforcements . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two casualties to six .
