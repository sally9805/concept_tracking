THE most startling news in the paper on February 13th was the weather forecast . It was " Rainy and dismal . " When we read the word " dismal " in the Times , we knew that the era of pure science was drawing to a close and the day of philosophical sci  --  ence was at hand . ( Probably in the nick of time . ) Consider what had happened ! A meteorologist , whose job was simply to examine the instruments in his ob  --  servatory , had done a quick switch and had examined the entrails of birds . In his fumbling way he had attempted to predict the impact of the elements on the human spirit . His was a poor attempt , as it turned out , but it was an attempt . There are , of course , no evil days in nature , no dies mali , and the forecast plainly showed that the weatherman had been spending his time indoors . To the intimates of rain , no day is dismal , and a dull sky is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the connection had been reestablished between nature and scientific man . Now all we need is a meteorologist who has once been soaked to the skin without ill effect . No one can write knowing  --  ly of weather who walks bent over on wet days . FEBRUARY 13T1-1 , although a dark Monday with snow in the air , was in fact a day of excellent portent and splendid natural tone . The heavenly triplets , Esopus , Schoharie , and Croton , received their first substantial bath in quite a while ; the long drought was eased ; snow , sifting into the woods up  --  state , held in escrow next summer 's cool drink of clear water . So it appears that the man of science needs more vision than is commonly applied to his work . To detect rain and thunder , a weather forecaster need look only twenty-four hours into the future , but to detect a whole man he must look ahead at least to next summer . This is what the atomic scientists have been learning about them ? selves and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they perceive that they have found something to confound and possibly destroy their enemies , but they 're not quite sure it will leave any solid ground under their friends . They are trying to gaze ahead to next summer . AGOOD part of man 's distrust of rain is connected with his concern about his trousers . A horse stands undis mayed in a shower because , for one thing , it is not wearing pants that are losing their crease . Women 's hats have given an entirely false meaning to or  --  dinary precipitation and have estranged millions of females from the source of all life . Despite her alarums , woman is as waterproof ( essentially ) as a horse . We have never seen a woman look bedraggled because of a wet hat or a collapsed umbrella  --  only because of a collapsed mind . ALTHOUGH nothing in nature partakes of evil , it is of course absurd to suggest that one set of weather conditions is not more buoyant than an  --  other . The most buoyant conditions we have encountered lately were those we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work , we went downtown and boarded the tug Barbara Moran , Capt . George Mason . ( It is sometimes advis  --  able to set off in a perverse direction right after breakfast . ) The morning itself was all that a low-spirited weather prophet could have asked for  --  clear skies , wind northwest , tide flooding . Our friends , by and large , were in bed , in itself a buoy ant thought . We soon found ourself pushing hard on the starboard bow of the Nieuw Amsterdam . The work of docking a liner has a purposeful quality that is infectious and health-giving and makes the river seem the only decent place to be . Barbara quivered in diesel-electric responsiveness . She wore ice on her rail . Captain Mason did not quiver , and wore a single-breasted blue suit , a pullover sweater , and dark glasses to cut the glare of the world 's extreme felicity . It amused us to note that the mechanics of getting a large ship into a narrow berth are just about what they were many , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its nose at progress . The best way to work a ship into a dock is for tugs to swarm out and lean against her . A simple-minded idea , but a perfect one . Even the signals from the docking pilot are as simple as ever : peeps on a mouth whistle for the bow tugs , blasts on the ship 's horn for the tugs at the stern . IT 'S twenty-five years this week since The New Yorker set up in business , and things have changed either greatly or not at all . An invitation we received this week sounded exactly like the in  --  vitations we were getting in the spring of 1925 . This one was to a " sugaring-off " party in a publisher 's office , to cele  --  brate a hook on maple sugar . Like the drip in a saphucket , the literary life goes by fits and starts , by freeze and thaw , but there is no appreciable change in the bizarre relationship between a live author and his newly published work . And when the sap starts rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll soon be sugaring-off time , and that you will be invited . Roving Curator THROUGH the courtesy of Dr. Bassett Maguire , a curator of the New York Botanical Garden , we 've enjoyed a leisurely inspection , in the Garden 's basement , of some of the most impressive blowguns in the world . Each FEDRIJA.RY 2 5 , 19 5 0 consists of a single joint of a rare species of bamboo , is ten to twelve feet long , has a bore a bit larger than a lead pen  --  cil , and is encased in the stem of a palm . The guns are made by the Maquiri  --  tare Indians , a tribe indigenous to the Guiana highlands of southern Vene  --  zuela , and are used to propel a dart two and a half feet long . The tip of the dart , nicked so it will break off and re  --  main embedded in its victim 's flesh , is generally coated with curare , a poison made by boiling the shredded hark of a plant of the Strychnat genus . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a mild-mannered , red  --  dish-haired man in his middle forties . " It will kill small animals in a few minutes and a man in less than an hour . The blowgun 's range is from fifty to seventy-five feet . I 've seen Indian kids shooting hummingbirds with them . " Dr. Maguire is sorting out a rather vast number of objects he brought back from a recent six-month expedition to Venezuela . These include samples and seeds of the aforementioned bamboo plant , which he gathered because the great height to which it grows and its long joints make it a hell of a botanical curiosity . Prior to his trip , the last white man to see it was Sir Robert Schomburgk , the famous Prussian-born botanist , who came across the plant in 1837 . It is named after him  --  afrundi  --  narie Schomburgleii . Dr. Maguire , who has n't yet made much progress in go  --  ing over his Venezuelan take  --  in all , he brought back about fifteen thousand dried plant specimens and two or three thousand living plants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Garden 's propagating greenhouse , but he 's not sure this is going to work . " I made my collections of it at the base of a cliff in a wet forest , full of clouds , at an altitude of five thousand feet , " he said . " It 's hard to reproduce those con  --  ditions in a greenhouse . " He told us that the reeds grow up to fifty feet high , in clumps , and arch out gracefully , mak  --  ing a wonderful sight . He then handed us a poisoned dart and stated that the curare it was treated with is the most powerful of some fifty varieties and the plant from which it was derived is also a prodigious rarity . Until Dr. Maguire came along this year , the last white man to see it in the Alto Orinoco was Baron von Humboldt , the German naturalist , who discovered it over a century ago . Dr. Maguire was accompanied through the blowgun terrain by his son , a Cornell undergraduate , who went along for the ride and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cooks , and packers . The last lap of the trip involved a hundred-mile paddle up the Cunticuntima River , a tributary of the Orinoco , and an eighty-mile walk , crawl , and climb through forests and tip mountains . The country is the oldest exposed land mass in northern South America and is covered with an ancient sandstone shield . " Plateaus eight thou  --  sand feet high , " Dr. M. said , " some of them isolated so long that the plants on them have developed in  --  dividual species . The most remarkable laboratory in ex  --  istence for the study of evolu  --  tion ! " His final push inland was terrific . " No trails , " he said . " We stripped down to absolute necessities and lived off the country for twenty days . " Dr. M. approached the Maquiritares with sign-language gestures and a large supply of beads , knives , scissors , thread , and Army-and-Navy-store pants , for trading purposes . " They generally wear loincloths , " he said , " hut the in  --  sects are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He showed us some objects he had obtained in barter : a hammock of native cotton , six feet wide ; heavy , spade-shaped paddles ; colorful head  --  gear made from the feathers of parrots and cocks of the rock ; baskets , rope , spears , and an ancient English muzzle-loading fowling piece . Dr. M. 's recent Venezuelan expedi  --  tion was his fifth , and he hopes to go on three more during the next three years . " I 'll be too old for such rugged trips after that , " he said . "   settle down and examine my material . " He figures this will take him and two assistants ten or twelve years .

' " The Ninth Street Day Nursery and Orphan Home is at 393 East Eighth Street . Problem WHEN , some weeks ago , a group V V of baseball writers voted Casey Stengel the Baseball Manager of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  tended to become a dentist and had quit dental school because he was left-handed and was afraid that nobody would trust a left-handed dentist . Base  --  ball is one business  --  perhaps the only one  --  in which left-handedness is re  --  garded as an asset . Stengel 's revelation reminded us that we 'd long been mean  --  ing to look into the matter of left-handed dentists , and , with the help of dental-supply houses and a couple of un  --  usual practitioners , we think we 've got the thing taped . The major difficulty is , of course , the makeup and location of the dental unit , that involved contrap  --  tion to which are affixed the drill , rins  --  ing basin , hot- and cold-air blowers , instrument tray , lights , and so on , and in whose main shaft , known as the pedestal , is concealed the motor that runs the drill . In a normal , or right-handed , setup , the pedestal stands on the patient 's Ieft and the dentist stands on his right . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right of the chair , with the result that its important parts have to be installed in reverse , and that some of them have to be made specially . The demand for left-handed outfits is so small that these parts are n't carried in stock . Through the considera  --  tion of the manufacturers , a left-handed unit does n't cost any more than a right-handed one , but there is one tool that costs considerably more in reverse  --  a pair of forceps with a hook along one handle to give the holder a better grip . Some southpaw practitioners regard the amount charged for this an imposition and stubbornly put up with right-hand  --  ed forceps , wincing now and then as the hook cuts into their palms . The most significant fact we discov  --  ered about left-handed dentists is that there are very few of them . Dental societies do n't keep track of sinistrality among their members , but , on the basis of dental-unit sales , one can assume that only about one per cent of the nearly ten thousand dentists in this area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole left-handers are supposed to constitute six or eight per cent . Unques  --  tinnably , the main reason for this dis  --  parity between dentists and other human beings is that few dental schools have any left-handed training units , and the majority of left-handed neophytes either give up or learn dentistry right-handed . Those who doggedly stick to their left-handedness go through their training standing on the wrong side of the chair , dodging the rinsing basin and other pro  --  jections as they work . A left-hander we got on the track of through a manufac  --  turer said that he entered dental school never dreaming that his left-handed  --  ness would turn out to be his principal problem . He soon found that during lec tures on dental procedures he had to listen especially hard , then do just the opposite of what the instructor had said . This turned out in the long run to be a helpful discipline , he figures . He told is without going massis c .

He 's at our head office , in Wall Street , but he regards this branch as so important that he has a private office here , too . " A junior officer greeted Mr. Sperry , who said , " Hello . How are you today ? .. That 's good . " Mr. Sperry next led us to two large murals by Francis Scott Bradford  --  one of Wall Street in 1812 , the year the City Bank of New York , predecessor of the National City Bank , was found  --  ed , and the other of the Elgin Bo  --  tanical Gardens , which occupied the site of the Fifth Avenue Branch in the early eighteen-hundreds  --  and then paused before a desk , which he bade us peek under . " Alarm under every desk , " he said , crouching at our side and pointing TO a trip lever attached to the underside of the desk top . " Sounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the numerals of that bronze clock , showing just where the trouble is . Ob  --  serve how open and restful the room is  --  no partitions , except where the tell  --  ers are , and no typewriters .

" He led us to the tellers ' section , at the west end of the room , where a guard in blue uniform and white gloves unlocked a door and let us in . " Hello . How are you today ! ' . That 's good , " said Mr. Sperry to one of the tellers . The latter showed us how , in an emer  --  gency , a roll-top cover can be quickly lowered over his cash drawers .

" How are you today ? ... That 's good . " Mr. Gilbert , who appeared to be in charge of the vaults , ushered us past a twenty-ton steel door set on rails and let us peer at four thousand safe-deposit boxes , ranging in size from two by five and a quarter by twenty-two inches to for  --  ty-four by forty-six by twenty - two inches , and in yearly rental from five FEBRUARY 2 , 5 t 19 5 0 to five hundred dollars .

" Lesser refine  --  ments beckoned , but our feet hurt and we gave up . " We offer every service here that our headquarters does down  --  town , " Mr. Sperry said . " It may mark a trend . One of our powder rooms shows scenes from Paris  --  Notre Dame , the Arc de Triomphe , the Madeleine . We like to think it 's cheerful . " A stenogra  --  pher passed us and greeted Mr. Sperry respectfully . " Hello , " he said . " How are you today : ... That 's good . " Improvement THE parents of a thirteen-year-old boy whose school marks have been something to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he told them at dinner that his class had had an examination that day and that his marks had taken a noteworthy turn for the better . " I was the highest of all those who failed , " he said . Feeling Lost CHARLIE CHAPLIN has been spend  --  ing a few days at the Plaza , and we found him in his suite there , hand  --  ing soiled laundry to a maid . The first words we heard him speak were " Here 's a very dirty shirt . " He looked in fine shape  --  pink-checked , with pure-white hair , bristling white eyebrows , and freckled hands . The problem of the laundry left him slightly distraught , and as soon as the maid departed , he turned around once or twice , in a sort of dance , then motioned us to a chair and lighted on the edge of a couch . Mrs Chaplin came in from the next room to say that she was going shopping , and Chaplin asked her to pick up a couple of hundred dollars for him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lobby , " he told us , after Mrs. Chaplin left . " At the same time , I hate to slash into a place with no money at all . It makes me feel lost . " He gazed thoughtfully at a toy on a nearby table . " There 's something I got for the kids , " THE NEW YORKER 25 he said " I have three from the age of four down , besides the two grown boys , Charles , Jr. , and Sydney . They 're both actors . Sydney is a good comedian , whimsical , with an excellent lilt , and he has size and stature . For one thing , he 's over six feet . But I 'm not sending him the toy . You put in a penny ...

There was a toy for chocolates , too , but I was n't sure about giving the children choco  --  late . " Chaplin told us he has been walking around town a lot , to take the place of tennis , which is how he gets his exercise at home . " The other day , I walked all up and down Tenth Avenue , and I loved it , " he said . " But , oh , the dirt and the ash cans ! " He sat silent a moment , and then suggested that we go down  --  stairs and have lunch . The two of us adjourned to the restaurant , where , walking just like Charlie Chaplin , Chaplin led the way to a table by a window . He sat down and looked out at Central Park . It was snowing . " What beautiful snow ! " Chaplin said . " T remember sitting here in this room , just like this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I registered as Charles Spencer  --  Spencer 's my middle name  --  and I stayed here because I did n't know any other place where you could dine . The police had sent me word on the train that I was n't to go in to Grand Central , be  --  cause of the crowds wait  --  ing to see me there , so I had to get off at 125th Street  --  and all I was coming here for was to look for a job . " Chaplin said that he hoped in the course of his current visit to find a leading lady for a movie he 's planning to make , but that he did n't know how to go about finding her . " I see shows and in  --  terview a certain number of people , out of a sense of duty , but all the peo  --  ple I 've found I 've al  --  ways found by luck , " he said . " This new role is a very difficult one .

' ? really quite humorlessly . I 'm going to see the poor dear after lunch . " Chaplin said , over lunch , that it had taken him two years to prepare the script of his new movie , that he had composed the music for it , and that he will , as usual , direct it , produce it , and act the leading role . He 's anxious to get it under way as quickly as possible . " I ca n't afford to wait too long on it , be  --  cause I use my own money , " he said . " I do n't want to say much about it , but I 've poured my guts into the script and I mean it to be the best thing I 've ever done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he played in his early films and from his role in " Monsieur Verdoux , " which he considers his best work . " I lost money on that one , " he said . " The people who came to see me came to see the funny man . They were shocked . They could n't adjust . They wanted to know where the big shoes were . " Though " Monsieur Verdoux " was a failure in this country , it won several prizes elsewhere , including the Danish equivalent of an Oscar . Chaplin recalled that when he en  --  tered the movies , in 1913 , his con  --  tract called for three pictures a week . They used to make a picture in half a day then . Chaplin told us that he acts without any conscious intellectual activ  --  ity . " All you feel while you 're acting is ebullience , " he said . " You intel  --  lectualize when you go into the pro  --  jection room and say , ' Now , why is n't that funny ?

I 'm emotional about most things but objective about my work . I do n't get satisfaction out of it , I get relief . " Chaplin said he does n't have time for much of anything besides his work and his family . " I live in my very secure house of cards , " he said . " I 'm a self-educated man and do n't get everything I 'd like to out of reading . Oh , maybe I browse through my Burton 's ' Anatomy of Melancholy , ' but I leave most of the reading to my wife . Besides , I 've an odd quirk in my sight . I see only the first word and the last in a line on a page . Must be something psycho  --  logical in that , do n't you think ?
