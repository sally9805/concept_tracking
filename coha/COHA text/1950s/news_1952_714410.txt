txt The Metropolitan Opera has obtained pledges of $900,000 toward the purchase price of $1,200,000 for a Columbus Circle site for a new opera house . It was learned yesterday that the prospects for raising the remaining $300,000 were good . The site was proposed to the Metropolitan last May . by Robert Moses , as head of the city 's slum clearance committee , as part of a plan for redevelopment of the area between Fifty-eighth and Sixtieth Streets from the Circle to Ninth and Columbus Avenues . The plan also calls for a municipal convention hall and garage and an apartment house . Today is the deadline for the Metropolitan to let Mr. Moses know whether it is ready to join in the venture , but it is believed almost certain that an extension of time will be granted . When Mr. Moses made his suggestion last May , he proposed that the new opera house should be part of a city musical center , with perhaps the New Yorlf Philharmanic-Symphony entering the picture . The Moses offer involved the al/otment of 80,000 square feet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west of the Circle . This land would be purchased by condemnation procedures until Title I of the Federal Housing Act , which provides a 66% per cent Federal land subsidy for slum clearance . The land would be available to the Metropolitan at $15 a square foot , which comes to $1,200,000 for the site for the opera house . Mr. Moses has ' made it clear to the , members of the Metropolitan board , however , that it must ' have the full purchase sum when the time comes to start condemnation proceedings . However , he is said to have been so keen to have the Metropolitan in the new area . that he is willing to give it a little more time . The $900,000 has been raised by a hard-working group of Metropolitan Opera board members . The largest pledge is for $500,000 , and there is another for $100,1300 . Nearly all the money has been promised by private individuals interested in the Metropolitan . When the Metropolitan has reached the $1,200,000 figure , its problems will only begin . It is estimated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $15,000,000 . If other musical organizations join in the new center , the building plans may have- to be much more ambitions and may come to $20,000,000 or $25,000,000 . Plans Talks With Philharmonic Once it has the money for the site , it is the Metropolitan board plan to institute serious conversations with the New York Philharmonic-Symphony , which owns no home of its own but which has been playing for many years in Carnegie Hall . There may also be negotiations with a leading ballet troupe to invite it to join the development . There is a possibility that the Metropolitan , which has ? established its own ballet corps , might be able to expand it so that it could carry out a season of its own by the time a new opera house is ready . The Metropolitan has not gone so far ahead as to think of architectural plans . But several years ago it engaged an outside company to make a survey as to which alternative would be more manageable : a new opera house or rebuilding of the old one on Thirtyninth Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were drawnup for construction of a tower on the Seventh Avenue side of the building and for extensi.4 alterations . The question of how large a new opera house should bp has also been canvassed in the past , and it has been agreed that more seats at low prices are needed than there are in the old 3,465-seat theatre . Related questions such as whether the opera auditorium in a new structure would be used for large symphony concerts remain to be examined . But there is common consent that if the new project is turned into a genuine music center , it must also have a small concert hall . The problem of raising the money for the new opera house will be one for the Metropolitan to solve . While a program remains to be organized , it is the conviction of members of the Metropolitan board that private individuals can not be expected to contribute the bulk *of the needed money . They point out that high taxes have made this all but impossible . Plea to Business Weighed But they believe that the money can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a - corporation can give up to 5 per cent of its income for charitable or civic purposes , and that such gifts are . tax-deductible . They add that there are many rich corporations in the city ? many whose business has a direct connection with the city 's life and others that make their headquarters here . Tentative plans call for an approach to such groups as the utilities , the big stores , the hotel industry , the clothing and fur industries . It was suggested that - if the corporations were to pledge a fixed sum for each of five years , a good deal . of the - money . for the new Opera house could be raised in this way . A new musical center on such a promising site as Columbus Circle , it was said , would be not only a cultural addition to New York but might even be good business . It is assumed that once condemnation procedures on the site are started , it will take six or eight months before the land is ready with a transferable title . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allowed for the raising of funds to build the new opera house . Under the terms of Mr , Moses ' offer , the Metropolitan , if it can not build a new house , must resell the land at the price it paid and only to a purchaser approved by the city . The Metropolitan 's present site might bring $5,000,000 . But there are $1,100,000 in mortgages on the property , and it would be the company 's hope that the money left over could be established as an endowment fund to ensure proper operation of a new theatre . In years gone by there have been several efforts to arrange for a new home for the Metropolitan . In the Twenties Otto H. Kahn , then president of the company , pur , chased a site on West Fifty-second Street , but the board did not vote for . a new house there , and apartment houses were built on it . In the late Twenties when Rockefeller Center was taking shape , a new opera house was in its plans , but the idea fell through @
