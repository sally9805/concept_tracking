The long-faced , lanky figure of John Foster Dulles was familiar . So was that of worldlywise , world-weary little Georges Bidault . The new face at the diplomatic table in Washington this week would be that of a lean Englishman who is pinch-hitting for Anthony Eden . He is the Tory Party 's hidden siege gun in foreign affairs . <P> His friends nickname him " Bobbety " with cause . His full name is Robert Arthur James Gascoyne-Cecil ( pronounced Sessil ) , and he is fifth Marquess of Salisbury , eleventh Baron Cecil of Essendon . By birth and marriage , Lord Salisbury , 59 , is a blueblood of bluebloods , related to half the noble families in the British Isles . It is said that " a Cecil never smiles except when another Cecil enters the room . " <P> With his bony , inbred face and mild Edwardian lisp , Salisbury at first meeting may look like a slightly astringent edition of a P. G. Wodehouse hero . But behind the prim manner and pained eyebrows lurks a will as strong as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has the same political acumen as Laborite Herbert Morrison , but with this difference : the marquess has been at the game 450 years longer . <P> Little Beagle . Fifteenth century records list the Cecils as " municipal worthies " in the Lincolnshire city of Stamford . They were ancient and loyal vassals of the Tudor kings , and when Henry VIII confiscated the lands of the Roman Church , the Cecils got their share . <P> William Cecil , first Baron Burghley , served Elizabeth I as chief adviser and Lord High Treasurer . It was he who sent Mary , Queen of Scots , to the block . His son , Robert , brought the Stuart dynasty to England in 1603 , lived to hear King James I dub him his " little beagle . " <P> Century after century the Cecils served king and country , and earned a rich reward . In Victoria 's day , Robert , the third Marquess , was three times Tory Prime Minister . It was he , Bobbety 's grandfather , who drove Winston Churchill 's father out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willow &; Oak . Historian Thomas Macaulay penned a hard judgment on the founder of the Cecil family : " Of the willow and not of the oak . " Bobbety is of the willow , pliable when he needs be to fill the job of Tory leader of the House of Lords , but he is also of the oak when principle is involved . Principle No. 1 is that Britain is not to be pushed around ( his speech on the " scuttle " of Abadan was the most violent of all ) ; principle No. 2 is that Britain 's international conduct should be moral . Salisbury , the aristocrat , is aloofly superior to any cynical bargain , be it with Moscow or Peking , even when Churchill , the politician , may not be . <P> Polo in the Streets . At 17 , Bobbety was a trainbearer at George V 's coronation ; thence , he trod a well-worn road : Eton , Oxford ( where he and the Prince of Serbia were fined for playing bicycle-polo in the streets ) , and the Grenadier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salisbury was known while his father was alive , got a medical discharge and married Betty Cavendish , niece of the Duke of Devonshire .
