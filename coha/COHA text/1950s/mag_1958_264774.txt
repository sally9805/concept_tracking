In other congressional action last week : <P> The Senate passed 88 to I ( Nevada 's George Malone ) the Kennedy-Ives labor bill ( TIME , June 23 ) , after voting to require employers as well as union officers to swear that they are not Communists to qualify for National Labor Relations Board services . The Senate earlier rejected a Kennedy-Ives proposal to strike the requirement from the law as " ineffective . " Aiming at correcting labor abuses by requiring 1 ) periodic secret-ballot union elections , 2 ) regular union reporting to the U.S. Labor Department on financial and other dealings , the bill now goes to the House , where its fate , in an election year , is doubtful . <P> The House passed , 345 to 12 , and sent to the Senate the long-awaited Administration bill to soften the McMahon Act 's atomic secrecy provisions . Under the bill the Administration would have discretion to tell any NATO ally the latest facts of the size and destructiveness of nuclear weapons , could also pass along , subject to congressional veto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. in the event of war . Any ally that had made " substantial progress " in its own atomic weapons program ( i.e. , Britain ) , subject to the same veto , could receive actual weapons designs , nuclear materials . <P> The Senate , illustrating the swiftness with which hot political issues sizzle up and then subside in Washington , passed a bill creating a new space agency by voice vote with only a third of its members present . Under its terms , space research and space projects programing would be planned by a seven-man board consisting of a new space director , the Secretaries of State and Defense , the chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission and representatives of three other agencies interested in astronautics ( not more than one of them in the Defense Department ) . The measure now goes to conference to iron out differences with a House bill passed early this month , which would create a single space boss , taking advice from a looser 17 &shy; man committee but not bound to follow it .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
