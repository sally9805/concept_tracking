" There 's no question of innovation , but only of clarification , " protested black-haired Jesuit Father Antonio Messineo in Rome last week . Those who regarded his article in the Jesuit fortnightly Civilt Cattolica as something new in Roman Catholic thought , he said , were wrong . Father Messineo 's conclusion had been that " tolerance is a duty of both individuals and states towards those who have accepted error and profess error . " This tolerance , reasoned Messineo , rises out of the respect due to the human person and to his God-given right of exercising his reason and working out his own destiny . " It logically follows , " he wrote , " that there is a right to tolerance , and that such a right is vested in the human person . This expression may cause some surprise , but . . . the only method to lead a person towards truth and away from error is the method of persuasion . " <P> But tolerance must always be directed to individuals and not to their errors , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on the side of truth . . . but there are three theological reasons why tolerance . . . is a duty . " In the field of practical politics , wrote Messineo , politics may be dictated by prudence ; in personal relations it is dictated by charity , and is required in recognition of each individual 's right to move freely in search of truth . <P> In an informal elaboration of his views , Father Messineo added : " Today tolerance is taking a larger place than ever in Catholic concept , because this is a democratic age and democracy stresses the rights of individuals . . . You 'll see that when the Dutch Catholics become a majority , * Holland will be a tolerant country-not because Dutch Catholics are indifferent to truth , not because they 'll deem it prudent to be tolerant , nor again out of charity , but because they are aware of the individual rights of non-Catholics to tolerance . " <P> <P> * Roman Catholics in The Netherlands now number 3,703,000 , Protestants 4,250,000.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
