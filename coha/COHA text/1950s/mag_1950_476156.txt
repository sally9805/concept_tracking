THE end of the first world war found H. L. Mencken climbing over a personal para-pet , throwing up a batch of signal flares , and advancing with fixed bayonet into the wacky no man 's land which was public life in the nineteen-twenties . The image may not be altogether apt ? Mencken detested physical exercise , and a month before the Armistice he had written a friend , with some bitterness , that the draft would probably snare him " despite my asthma , piles , tongue trouble , hay fever , alcoholic liver , weak heels , dandruff , etc. " ? but it is certainly true that the coming of the new era brought him extraordinary recognition and that he met that recognition more than half-way . The first edition of his American Language ( which he called " a heavy indigestible piece of cottage cheese " ) was a smashing success ; everywhere his name was identified with liberating influences , and from the indiscriminate came a chorus of praise and abuse ? a chorus which delighted him , though he took it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had shifted . It had swung toward Mencken . And it sent him , as his most hostile critic put it , off " at a hard gallop , spattered with mud ... high in oath . " It was during this period of unrest and change that Mencken 's individual and specific impact upon the national letters reached its height . He was still regarded , and still regarded himself , as primarily a literary critic , and the swarms of young and promising authors drew him , more and more frequently , to New York . He remained , on these visits , the hick from Baltimore , but the city was now teeming with hicks who had something to say , and the cosmopolitan tone of the literati , together with the tremendous esteem in which he was now held , served to temper his painful self-consciousness . Alfred Knopf , his publisher , drew his friends together when he was in town , and Mencken 's suite at the Algonquin was thrown open to late parties , with illegal hooch and subversive statements carrying the insurgents through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet after a bout with influenza , was as delightful as ever . Together he and Mencken redecorated the walls of their Smart Set office , tacking up a Hoover-for-President poster , a one-sheet of Louis Robie 's " Crackerjacks , " and a batch of temperance posters Edna Ferber had sent them from Paris . They sent out requests for a gilt chair which would collapse if a fat lady poet sat in it , photographs of the late Czar Nicholas , Bishop Manning , and Lillian Russell ( in tights ) , and a concrete bust of a leading reformer . When delighted friends responded , the two editors promptly announced for the Republican Presidential and Vice-Presidential candidacies , and they published in their magazine a platform including promises to take the Statue of Liberty out beyond the three-mile limit and dump it , to wear no cutaway coats or plugged hats , to abolish the Y.M.C.A. , to establish enormous arenas in which to turn clergymen loose upon one another , and to turn the Philippines over to Japan . Word of the announcement spread , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a brief , solemn flurry of interest over the " surprise candidates . " In the New York Sun , Berton Braley pretty well summed up the attitude of their contemporaries to all this in the opening lines of his satirical " Mencken , Nathan , and God " : There were three who sailed away one night Far from the maddening throng And two of the three were always right And everyone else was wrong But they took another along , these two , To bear them company , For He was the only One ever knew Why the other two should be . And so they sailed away , these threeMencken , Nathan , And God . No issue was serious to them , no figure exempt from the harlequinade . Every topic of importance , it seemed , wound up on the vaudeville stage as a sort of burlesque of itself . Nathan , who loved the theater , and Mencken , Nyho hated it , spent much time defending their respective positions , but when the difference reached the dignity of debate , it was slapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , discovered a play by Dario Niccodemi which , in sheer awfulness , surpassed anything ever seen on the New York stage . Indeed , so terrible was the performance that , fascinated , he sat through the last curtain . Back at his apartment in the Royalton Hotel he wrote Mencken , with great seriousness , that however much a man might dislike the theater , he should not miss the greatest drama since Ibsen 's debut . Mencken was doubtful , but if Nathan said so .... Up he came to New York , dressed to kill for the great occasion . Nathan tipped off John Williams , then Charles Frohman 's right-hand man , and the three took a box at the Morosco . Mencken was placed in the center . There he sat , bolt upright , looking , as Nathan told him later , like Harding , while his hosts , during the performance , murmured ecstatically to one another , " Oh , this scene ! " . . " Is n't it tremendous ? " . . . " What a speech ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drama critic , he ought to know ? but as the farce wore on , he protested over and over again , more and more loudly , " Pishposh ! " At the very end , he caught on , eyed Nathan and Williams with great severity , and lustily croaked . " Yrsiwosx1 " And the dignified debate was over . ENCREN 'S reputation , like himself , was most stimulated among other aliens in New York or among writers in other parts of the country . His New York friends , like Mencken , were strangers to Broadway ; in New York they might cavort , free from the taboos of the home town . His most enthusiastic followers lived in the provinces , and their number seemed to increase in direct proportion to the ridicule directed at rural regions . All over America the reaction against patriotism had set in , and if the local boomers fumed when a specific locale was singled out for Smart Set abuse , the local literati flourished . No more violent attack was printed in these years than the " Sahara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm among Southern poets . The South , Mencken wrote , was " that stupendous region of fat farms , shoddy cities , and paralyzed cerebrums . . . that gargantuan paradise of the fourth-rate " which stretched , " a vast plain of mediocrity , stupidity , lethargy , almost of dead silence , " between " senile " Virginia and " crass gross , vulgar , and obnoxious " Georgia . Con ? templating its letters , Mencken thought of " Asia Minor , resigned to the Armenians , Greeks , and wild swine , of Poland abandoned to the Poles . " As Mencken 's popularity zoomed , he devoted his social energies to cultivating and whooping up the young talent which had sought out the Smart Set . Characteristically , he met the new excitement with great industry and incessant grumbling . He acknowledged that " a hundred thousand second-hand Coronas rattle and jingle in ten thousand remote and lonely towns , and the mail of every magazine editor is as heavy as the mail of a getrich-quick stockbroker , " but the manuscripts pouring in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " mainly crap . " It may be that he actually thought so , but if so , his interests had suddenly and completely turned to the soliciting , reading , and purchasing of crap . Every young man who approached either Mencken or Nathan was cordially received and his talents thoroughly investigated . When a bacteriologist named Paul de Kruif sat down one afternoon in the old Hotel . Pontchartrain in Detroit and wrote Mencken , asking if he could combine science and writing , he was invited to the Smart Set for succor. 1 , Vhen a playwright named Eugene O'Neill timidly ventured to cross recognized dramatic horizons ; his plays were printed and he was urged to go still further . And when three young Princeton graduates ? John Peale Bishop , Edmund Wilson , and F. Scott Fitzgerald ? stormed the Royalton one morning after the war , they were wined , victualed , and warned by Nathan that failure to submit stories to the magazine would be taken as a personal affront . It was this same critical tutelage , given the first faltering steps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mencken 's elevation to critical sainthood by the first war generation . For almost a decade there was scarcely a major writer in the country who did not trace his career from a first acceptance by the Smart Set . ENCREN and Nathan still avoided literary parties , partly because of the people they drew , but also because they had no time for such frivolity . In the first year after the war , they were lured to but one such affair . It turned out to be the most ghastly experience of their careers to date ? and by all odds the most profitable . Tom Smith of the Century insisted they drop by " just for one drink . " Mencken complained vigorously in the cab , and as soon as the door opened he knew he had made a dreadful mistake . They were greeted by a tall , skinny redhead , obviously quite drunk , who wrapped one arm around Mencken 's neck and another around Nathan 's . Resistance was quite useless ; he had them by the esophagi , and as Nathan groaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelled into their flinching eardrums , " So you guys are critics , are you ? Well , let me tell you something . I 'm the best goddam writer in this here goddam country and if you , Georgie , and you , Hank , do n't know it , you 'll know it goddam soon . Say .. . " There was no escape , at least not for the present . While Smith shrugged and the other guests , amused , looked on , the summit of their fears held forth on his own abilities and the necessity for favorable notice in the Smart Set . At the end of a half hour the door of the flat opened and Mencken and Nathan , wild-eyed , fled down the stairs and into the first cab that passed , sympathizing with one another and vowing never again to come within shouting distance of Smith 's place . But their troubles with " the louse , " as Mencken called their persecutor for want of a name , were not over . Next morning , dropping by the office on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the proofs of a novel , together with a note from the publisher , thanking him for the praise he had allegedly bestowed on the author at Smith 's party . Disgusted , he was about to toss the sheets in the wastebasket when he suddenly remembered he had nothing to read on the train . In Jersey City he became interested . In Philadelphia he was fascinated , and hack at Hollins Street that afternoon he excitedly wrote Nathan : " Grab hold of the bar-rail , steady yourself , and prepare for a terrible shock ! I 've just read the advance sheets of the book by that lump we met at Schmidt 's and , by God , he has done the job ! It 's a genuinely excellent piece of work . I begin to believe that perhaps there is n't a God after all . There is no justice in the world . " The novel , as many will have guessed , was Main Street ; the redhead , Sinclair Lewis . His performance that first night had not been out of character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent , and once he and Nathan had extracted a promise to " keep your goddam hands off our goddam necks , " they got along famously . Between them , on Mencken 's visits to New York , they gave bar patrons as bizarre a show in the perversion of American mores as even that jaded audience had ever seen , with Mencken quoting from Prohibition pamphlets and Lewis delivering a lecture on the merits of Rotary or a sermon on the beauty of the Church of God . By January of 1922 , Lewis was looking to Mencken for critical tutelage . " You ask about the new novel ? which wo n't be out till next September , " he wrote from London : It 's curiously associated with yourself . A year ago in a criticism of Main Street you said that what ought to be taken up now is the American city ? not NY or Chi but the cities of 200,000 to 500,000 ? the Baltimores and Omahas and Buffalos and Birminghams , etc . I was startled to read it because that was precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But your piece helped me to decide on this particular one as against one or two others which , at the time , I also wanted to do . 1 think you 'll like it ? I hope ... you do . All our friends are in it ? the Rotary Club , the popular preacher , the Chamber of Commerce , the new bungalows , the bunch of business men jolliers lunching at the Athletic Club . It ought to be at least 2000% American , as well as forward-looking , right-thinking , optimistic , selling the idea of success , and go-getterish . The central character is a Solid Citizen , one George F. Babbitt , real estate man , who has a Dutch Colonial house out on Floral Heights ... . FOR some time Mencken had been anxious to get rid of the Smart Set . For one thing , the title was distasteful . To him and , he felt , to many of his readers , it meant a fashion magazine . Since the days when he and Nathan had dreamed of a periodical to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a new magazine with an American motif , and when Knopf brought up the idea on his own hook , Mencken fairly seethed with enthusiasm . There was but one obstacle . found Nathan , who was little interested in Mencken 's talk of a periodical dealing with the political ramifications of the national scene such ramifications , lukewarm . Literary and artistic interests were quite enough for him , and he viewed as alarming Mencken 's increasing absorption with things political . Knopf was acceptable ? eminently acceptable ? as a publisher , but if Knopf wanted a magazine , why could n't it be the Smart Set ? Mencken , doubtful , approached Knopf , and Knopf , after huddling with his father , business manager of the firm , returned their verdict . It was No . A new magazine or none was Knopf 's position , and Nathan , somewhat dubious , was drawn into the scheme . Nor were Nathan 's doubts his alone . Knopf had seen , as Mencken had not , the growing breach between the editorial enthusiasms of of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed , would be best edited by Mencken alone . But Mencken 's sense of loyalty balked at this . Nathan had always been with him , and , he vowed , Nathan always would be . There had to be two editors for the new project , and they had to be Mencken and Nathan . Thus it was that two of the three sponsors for the Smart Set 's heir ? Nathan and Knopf ? went into the inaugural conference with grave misgivings . The first squabble developed over a name . Mencken and Nathan liked the Blue Review , probably for sentimental reasons , but Knopf vetoed it . Then a long series of prospective titles was proposed : the Twentieth Century , the Capitol , the Defender , the Sovereign , the Regent , the Chancellor , the Portfolio , the Pendulum , the Other Man 's Monthly , the Cray Monthly , the Colonnade , the Inter-Continental Review , the Athenaeum , the Colonial Review , and the New Review . Finally , Nathan suggested the American Mercury . Mencken protested at once ; it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the London Mercury , the Mercure de France , or the Mercurio Peruano . Knopf , however , voted for the American Mercury , and the American Mercury it became . Next came the problem of the Smart Set . Before any sort of contract could be written between the publisher and his editors , Mencken and Nathan must first get rid of their Smart Set stock . Hearst was approached , but refused to buy . Mencken suspected that he was really interested , however , and an ingenious scheme was devised . The stock was sold to a friend , with the understanding that if Hearst would buy within a year , the editors should share in the proceeds . Sure enough : in a few months , Hearst was nibbling . He bought the Smart Set and turned it over to a sub-editor , who for six years turned out a sleazy product . This done , Mencken and Nathan signed with Knopf , assuming complete editorial responsibility and the ownership of one third of the magazine . Offices were to he at Knopf 's at 730 Fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conferring with Knopf over problems of typography and format and writing prospective contributors , asking for manuscripts which might fit the tone of the Mercury . The magazine , designed by Elmer Adler , was to be green-backed ; the type , Garamond ? again , over objections from Mencken , who was afraid it would look " too damned Frenchy . " Letters went out each week to such men as Upton Sinclair , Dreiser , Hergesheimer , Gerald W. Johnson , Gamaliel Bradford , Jim Tully , a newcomer to the Smart Set , and Dr. Raymond Pearl of Baltimore , whom Mencken then knew only as one of the scientific writers he was patronizing . Later , as Pearl contributed more and more frequently to the Mercury he became one of Mencken 's closest friends , but in August he was simply " Dear Dr. Pearl " : I am preparing to set up a new monthly review in New York , and turn to you in the hope that you may be interested in it . . . . I am trying to get together a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be depended upon to tell the truth as they see it . For example , Lowie in anthropology , Chafee and Pound in law , Grant La Farge in architecture , Watson in psychology , and so on ... . To Sinclair he wrote more frankly : I shall try to cut a rather wide swathe with it , covering politics , economics , the exact sciences , etc. , as well as belles-lettres and the other fine arts . . . . You know me well enough to know that there will be no quarter for the degraded cads who now run the country . I am against you and the Liberals because I believe you chase butterflies , but I am even more against your enemies . Certain features were carried over from the Smart Set : the collection of " Americana , " Mencken 's literary article , Nathan 's drama criticism , and the column of observations on the human comedy , written by Mencken and Nathan in the Smart Set under the heading " Repetition Generale , " henceforth to be known as " Clinical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time which augured well for infant publications ? the Reader 's Digest was founded in 1922 , Time in 1923 , and the New Yorker in 1925 ? and Mencken and Nathan were full of high hope as they put the finishing touches on the first issue . It was hope well justified . The opening number , for January 1924 , came out just before Christmas , and was swept off the newsstands . By December 28 they were on the presses with the second edition of the number , and Knopf excitedly sent Mencken word from New York that the circulation department was already 670 subscriptions behind . " Knopf has bought thirty new yellow neckties , " Mencken wrote a friend , " and has taken a place in Westchester County to breed Assyrian wolfhounds . " Within a month the issue had been reprinted a second time and the February number was headed for a twenty-five-thousand circulation ? this in a fifty-cent magazine which its editors had never expected to go over twenty thousand . So rapidly did the subscription lists mount that the printers , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid off at once and the Mercury , in effect , had financed itself . Nor was the end in sight . An average monthly circulation of 38,697 in 1924 soared to 77,921 in 1926 , and never dropped below sixty-five thousand until the Depression . Knopf 's business department , stunned at first , immediately plunged into advertising in the big cities , whence most of the subscribers came , and in the college towns , where circulation seemed to approximate population . Mencken was delighted . " Prayer still has its old power , " he wrote Carl Van Doren . III I ry THE Mercury office he was regarded with a mixture of awe , respect , and affection . Knopf had set aside a tiny room for the magazine , and this was divided by a partition , with Mencken , Nathan , and Edith Lustgarten , their editorial secretary , on one side , and ten advertising and circulation workers on the other . These ten worked at extremely close quarters , huddled among great piles of figures , bills , and copy layouts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Once through to the other side of the partition , they found a bare and only slightly less crowded closet furnished by three desks and the great brass spittoon Mencken had rescued from his gaudy Smart Set quarters . To this office he now came on his periodic visits to New York , which began Monday morning and extended through Wednesday afternoon . All outstanding business in the editorial offices was settled Monday . Letters were dictated , and the few authors who had to be seen were interviewed . As a general rule , he and Nathan avoided the company of writers outside the office , and lunch hours and evenings were spent with old friends . Often , just as Mencken had settled down to some particularly absorbing editorial chore at the Mercury , the phone would ring : Knopf , anxious to show off his prize dog , had a distinguished visitor in his office . Mencken would swear a bloody oath ? part of Miss Lustgarten 's necessary equipment , she had been told , was a pair of asbestos ears ? and after methodically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . To his desk each day came between fifty and sixty letters , from authors , aspiring authors , admirers , and , more often , assailants of the Mercury . " I have just read your magazine , and it certainly is nothing I would want my fourteen-year-old daughter to read " a matron would write ; or , " If you do n't like the good old IJ . S. A. , the boats are still sailing for Russia , buddy . " At first , their terrific labor brought the editors small financial return ; despite the Mercury 's soaring circulation , the initial expenses soaked up most of the income , and Mencken found himself working at a frantic pace with little difference to his bank book save the money drawn out for New York trips . " The increasing business of the American Mercury is working me to death , " he wrote Gamaliel Bradford . " I find that I am now a business man in active practice , with many of the duties that also belong to the pants business . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a New York hotel room , furiously editing Mercury articles between Baltimore Evening Sun editions , nearly broke his health , and he began to cast around for help . He found it in a wide-eyed young product of the Boston slums , fresh out of Harvard and full of desire to crash the magazine business . Charles Angoff had submitted examples of his work to a number of magazines , the Mercury among them . A correspondence with Mencken prospered , they met in New York , and ultimately he was offered the job of assistant editor . It was a bid half of young intellectual America might have snapped at , and Angoff took it without a question . Twenty-four hours later , he found himself , terrified and confused , in complete charge of the magazine : Mencken , sick of routine , had introduced him to the office staff and then blithely left for Baltimore on the next train . Angoff 's only instructions were to answer all letters the day they arrived and to return all manuscripts within twenty-four hours . There was , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angoff proved capable , however , and henceforth he handled most of the correspondence and made up each month 's issue . In matters of detail , he found , Mencken was completely irresponsible ; indeed , his irresponsibility was at times alarming . When , during his first weeks on the Mercury , Angoff received a formal request for the magazine 's circulation , and asked Mencken what it was , he was told it hovered at two hundred twenty-five thousand . The information was sent out ; then he looked it up and came back to Mencken on the run . " It 's under fifty thousand , " he gasped . " Why did you say that ? " " Well , " said Mencken , with a nonchalant flip of his Uncle Willie cigar , " It 's a good round figure . " H is Mercury work , as with the Smart Set , was done at Mencken 's Hollins Street home in Baltimore . There he solicited and received manuscripts and there his critical articles and editorials were written . He remained , as always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of editors . Rarely was a manuscript held over three days , and before it went into the magazine , the author was given the opportunity to inspect the proofs for error . His consideration for contributors was remarkable . If , reading a manuscript , he thought it might be sold to a magazine paying more money , the author was so advised , and Mencken offered to withdraw . Stories of promise which , for various reasons , did not suit the Mercury were returned with notes suggesting magazines they did suit . In return for this , Mencken asked his contributors to bear with him through several revisions of each manuscript before it saw print . " When it goes into the American Mercury , " he wrote Jim Tully after the nth rewriting of an article , " I want it to be perfect " ? by which he meant an integral part of the expression of his personality which the magazine had come to be . Twenty years before , as city editor of the Baltimore Morning Herald , he had written new leads until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no managing editor over him , he rewrote incessantly , inserting the word or phrase which gave the piece the proper salting of Menckenese . Titles were changed constantly ( " The Decline of the Negro Churches " became " Black America Begins to Doubt " ) for this same reason , and no suggestion for a projected article went out without detailed instructions for its writing . Back the manuscripts would go , again and again , with notes describing Mencken 's bouts with his editorial conscience , usually beginning , " My eyes are streaming with tears as I write , but the bald fact remains . . . , " and winding up with an embellished request for another try . In the end , authors generally got the idea : everything which came under Mencken 's pencil had to have something of him in it before it could get his stamp of approval . If it did not , the author wound up with the original story and the short note : Mr. Mencken has just entered a Trappist monastery at Gethsemane , Ky. , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am returning the enclosed for your archives . Sincerely yours , Edith Lustgarten Such editorial conduct would have been irritating had it not succeeded so enormously . What his readers were buying , after all , was Mencken , and if the contents had strayed far from his interests , they would have doubtless been as disappointed as would he . The scraps of " Americana " printed each month ? sweet tributes to Edgar A. Guest ; news items of ministers wearing black ties presented by silk manufacturers , singing " Blest Be the Tie That Binds. " and offering to eat their straw hats if the word of God were proven untrue ? were surely not representative of America . They were representative only of the editor 's absorption and of the vital , iconoclastic personality he was vending . Open a copy of the Mercury for these years ? say that for December I 924 ? and you find his stamp on virtually every page : in the essay on Bryan by Edgar Lee Masters ; in the study of the jury system ; in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report on letters to conTHE gressmen by their constituents ; in the James M. Cain attack on the blowziness of statesmen ; in the notes on the Ku Klux Klan , on Dr. Frank Crane , on journalism , on the ancient Greeks . Was it a one-man magazine ? Not quite ? not yet . Nathan still wrote his monthly theater article and the " Clinical Notes " department ; to it he still brought authors who were his special prot ? g ? s . But more and more , as Mencken threw himself into the enterprise with all of his unbelievable energy , it became a product of the peculiar maelstrom which he had created , and in which he now lived . Through its pages each month he brawled and bellowed with the gusto of a Norfolk whore , the finesse of a Spanish fencer , and the independence of a Maine farmer . " The news that the American Mercury is ' lacking in constructive points of view ' is surely not news to me , " he wrote Upton Sinclair in answer to criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it , it will only be over my mutilated and pathetic corpse . The uplift has damn nigh ruined the country . What we need is more sin . " Significantly , perhaps , Sinclair , who was one of the Mercury 's sharpest critics , was also one of its greatest benefactors . Like many an established writer who disagreed with Mencken 's basic tenets , he was moved to admiration for the tremendous energy and positiveness of his editorship , and so sent him the names of deserving young writers who crossed his horizons . It was this channeling of raw talent toward Baltimore , combined with Mencken 's sharp eye for merit in unsolicited manuscripts , which brought to the magazine so high a level of writing . As a quality magazine unafraid to make the common man respectable , the Mercury was working in a virgin field , and hence was untroubled by competition . Stories by jailbirds on penitentiaries , by prostitutes on whoredom , by vagrants on how to bum a meal ? all found an eager reader in Mencken . From Ernest Booth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " We Rob a Bank , " " I Face a jury of My Peers , " and " Ladies of the Mob " ; from Robert Tasker , another convict , came " The First Day . " Rightists , Leftists , geniuses , boobs ? if they could write , it was enough . There was room for them between the Paris-green covers of the American Mercury . yET the most distinguishing characteristic of the Mercury , which gave it its very special flavor and for which it is best remembered , was not the quality of its contributions , not even the saucily edited articles on the Klan and the Babbitts , but the pieces from Mencken 's own pen . While he tenderly cultivated budding talent and spread himself with courteous gestures before all authors , this other side of Mencken ? this curious combination of Voltaire , Frederick the Great , Thomas Jefferson , and Main Street ? thundered closer and closer , as the twenties grew older , to an absolute in philosophical nihilism never before approached in America . His stupendous gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathtaking , so awe-inspiring , so terrible in its indictment of the national culture that it wrung monthly gasps from sixty thousand readers and porcupined the hair of intellectuals , army officers , bond salesmen , and garage mechanics in St. Paul , St. Louis , St. Joseph , and St. Cloud . How could so violent a hymn of hate be sung so jubilantly ? Hear it : The normal American of the " pureblooded " majority goes to rest every night with the uneasy feeling that there is a burglar under the bed , and he gets up every morning with a sickening fear that his underwear has been stolen . Of the farmer : No more grasping , selfish , and dishonest mammal , indeed , is known to students of the anthropoidea ; he deserves all that he suffers under our economic system and more . Of the war : That combat was carried on , at least from this side of the fence , in a grossly hysterical , disingenuous , cowardly , and sordid manner . Of religion : The church itself , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more prosperous . They dream of it behind the egg-stove on winter nights , their boots off , their socks scorching , Holy Writ in their hands . They dream of it as they commune with Bos taurus , Sus scrofa , Mephitis mechitis , the Methodist pastor , the Ford agent . It floats before their eyes as they scan the Sears Roebuck catalogue for horse liniment , porous plasters , and Bordeaux mixture . .. This Utopia haunts and tortures them , they long to make it real . They have tried prayer , and it has failed ; now they turn to the secular arm . The dung-fork glitters in the sun as the host prepares to march . . And as he howled across the union , month after month , back came the answering refrain , from delighted college students , from posturing preachers , from disillusioned intellectuals , from infuriated matrons of the D.

" The Reverend John Roach Stratton , addressing four hundred students at Harvard , compared Bryan to Gladstone and opened an attack on Mencken . He was heckled to a halt by boys waving green-backed magazines . " Why are there lightning rods on church steeples ? " shouted a sophomore . " God expects people to use their heads , " stammered Stratton . H. L. Mencken ! " These literary poseurs , Harold sic L.
