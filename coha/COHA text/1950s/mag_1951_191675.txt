( See Cover ) <P> Said the President of France : <P> " They represent us as a country divided and discouraged , as a country which would not fight for its independence , as a country which has abandoned itself . All this is not true . . . We know invasion , aggression , occupation well enough not to let ourselves be seduced by sophisms or fooled by lies . We would fight and be in the front ranks . " <P> This week Jules Vincent Auriol , 66 , first President of the Fourth Republic , would arrive in the U.S. for a ceremonial visit . He hoped to persuade doubtful Americans that France would be a strong and steadfast ally against Communism . " France , " says Auriol , " will fight for the victory of common sense . " Auriol 's career and his present position exemplified some of the main arguments for both an optimistic and a pessimistic view of France 's future . On the plus side : his integrity , his Resistance record . On the minus side : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has failed to arouse France against Communism . <P> French diplomats thought that President Auriol would be just the man for Americans to listen to . A cheerful , bubbling extrovert with a good , plain-spoken word for everybody , Auriol looks and acts like the mayor of a thriving French town ( which he was for 15 years ) or like a man who would enjoy a musical evening with Harry Truman . ( Auriol plays the violin . ) On his only previous visit to Washington , as a member of the 1925 Franco-American War Debts Commission , Auriol shocked his superiors by running up and embracing the doorman at the French embassy , who turned out to be an old school chum . " If you please , Vincent , behave yourself , " reproved the commission 's president , stiff-backed Joseph Caillaux . " Hey , President , " laughed Auriol , " what would you do if you met an old pal from Mamers ? " <P> Easygoing Vincent Auriol is the sort of incumbent the French public wants ( but has seldom had ) in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who possesses enough native dignity to give his job as chief of state just a wisp of kingly bearing . <P> " Vote for the Stupidest . " Haunted by the fear of both Bonaparte and Bourbon restorations , the Frenchmen who reconstituted the Republic after the Franco-Prussian War in 1871 reduced the powers of the President to almost honorary dimensions . Thereafter , the jealous deputies usually selected as President the kind of man who would not try to broaden the scope of his job . <P> At the election in 1887 , Clemenceau summed up this view of the presidency by growling at his colleagues , " Vote for the stupidest . " His fellow deputies paid him a backhanded compliment 33 years later , when they decisively voted him down for the same office. *
