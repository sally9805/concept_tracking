Calmly and confidently , Britain 's new Prime Minister took the torch from the old Titan 's hand and prepared to carry on in his place . Sir Anthony Eden , 57 , had waited patiently for the summons that he knew must come ; the change had long been accepted as inevitable ; the transition was smooth and speedy . Yet last week , when it did come , the replacement of their great Prime Minister struck Britons with all the suddenness of the sun going down behind Ben Nevis . <P> One moment Sir Winston Churchill was there in all his glory-venerable as Queen Victoria , familiar as Big Ben . Next moment , or so it seemed , the dauntless old figure had vanished , and Britain had the feeling that John Bull himself was gone . At 4:25 p.m. , in the quiet of an April afternoon , 80-year-old Sir Winston Spencer Churchill put on his black frock coat and drove off to see the Queen . <P> Summons for Anthony . Next day Elizabeth sent for the tall , handsome greyheaded figure who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the palace . Top hat gleaming , Sir Anthony Eden drove along the Mall as the Scots Guards wheeled and stomped in the blaze of color and trumpets that is the changing of the palace guard . Approaching the iron gates , his chauffeur blinked the Humber 's lights in a recognition signal . The sentries crashed their rifles in salute . <P> Eden 's talk with the Queen lasted half an hour . At the end she clenched her fists and held them out before him , the right on top of the left , to symbolize the holding of the Sovereign 's sword . Sir Anthony knelt and kissed them , thereby accepting the office of Prime Minister and First Lord of the Treasury . <P> Passion for Politics . The House of Commons that afternoon hummed with anticipation . The benches were packed tight , but on the government front bench no one sat in the place that in times past has been filled by Walpole , Chatham and Pitt , Wellington , Peel , Palmerston , Disraeli , Gladstone and Churchill . Then , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly picked his way over the outstretched feet of his sprawling ministers and subsided into Churchill 's seat . The House cheered . <P> " We all wish the new Prime Minister health and strength , " said ex-Prime Minister Clement Attlee in the course of a tribute to Churchill . " We can not , of course , wish him a long tenure of office . . . but as a Mr. Young said to Lord Melbourne when that statesman was hesitating to accept the premiership : ' Why , damn it all . . . if it only last three months , it will be worthwhile to have been Prime Minister of England . ' ' ' <P> Eden stepped up to the dispatch box , flushed but serene . His first thought was for his old master , and he moved the House , as he rarely does , when he spoke of " my Right Honorable friend 's courage , " his magnanimity , his humor , and his " passion for the political life . " " I enjoyed very much the Melbourne reflections , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have forgotten that Melbourne , although always talking of leaving office , contrived to stay there for a very long time indeed .
