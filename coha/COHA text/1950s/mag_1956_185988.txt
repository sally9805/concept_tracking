Unfolding his breakfast newspaper one morning last week in Paris , Secretary of State John Foster Dulles received an egg-curdling shock . Addressing the NATO conference opening session one day earlier , Dulles had carefully set the tone of U.S. participation with an appeal for moral principles in international affairs , cited the British-French cease-fire in Egypt as a compliance with morality . But his newspaper bannered a point-blank refutation of Dulles ' argument by an influential American diplomat : his breakfast host , Ambassador Clarence Douglas Dillon . Returning briefly to the U.S. last fortnight , Dillon had paused in Washington to record a radio interview for CBS 's Capitol Cloakroom . One inevitable question : Why had the British and French stopped their Suez advance ? Dillon 's exact answer : " Well , I think what is generally felt to be the reason in the Middle East is probably-was probably the main reason , and that was fear of Soviet armed intervention . It was-I do n't think-they knew that we were-certainly it was not the oil pressure ; that had n't had time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this thing , but they had continued as long as they did even in the face of that opposition ; they only had to continue for a couple of days more and that job would have been done . The only new element that had come in was these Soviet threats , which were very , very strongly phrased . " " But , " insisted CBS Newsman George Herman , " you do n't think it was moral suasion that stopped them ? " Answered Dillon unequivocally : " I do n't think it is moral suasion , no . " Broadcast three days later , Dillon 's recorded remarks stirred pro-Americans in Egypt , who were afraid that apparent U.S. sponsorship of the phony Moscow-did-it line might harm U.S. prestige just when that prestige was needed to get the Suez Canal running again . In Washington the State Department quickly announced that Dillon " was expressing his personal views in answer to a question " ; privately State 's exasperated spokesmen predicted that Soviet propaganda would make much of Dillon 's blunder . <P> <P> After an uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own statement , emphasized he " had no intention of minimizing the effect of worldwide moral pressure which was exerted through the United Nations . " Hedged the ambassador : he would have listed all the causes behind the British-French action , but time ran out on him . Explaining his good intentions , Dillon explained something else as well : why , as a result of such impulses toward irresponsibility , U.S. foreign policy is sometimes criticized as confused .
