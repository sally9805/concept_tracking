Passed from one to another by his expatriate fellow countrymen , Reporter Val Chu , in the U.S. after six years as a member of TIME 'S Hong Kong news staff , conducted a month-long survey of the Communist pressures at work on Chinese students in the U.S. His report : <P> At whatever address they happen to be , dozens of Chinese refugee students will get letters from home this week , and each will bring a heaviness of heart and a torment of fear . Since last March , between 10% and 20% of the Chinese students and ex-students in the U.S. have received such letters , for they are a part of Peking 's intensive campaign to woo the refugees back . Invariably they come from the students ' families , who may not have written for years . They seldom dwell upon domestic trivialities , but upon the glories of the " New China " and the boundless opportunities to be found there . But the most frightening thing about them is not what they say ; it is the fact that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , and is pressuring relatives to bring about their return . <P> Promises &; Problems . Red China first officially launched its offensive against the minds and morale of Chinese students in the U.S. during the summer of 1954 . At the first Geneva Conference Chou En-lai accused the U.S. of " persecuting " and " detaining " Chinese students , especially 124 technicians held by the U.S. during the Korean war so that their skills would not be available to the enemy . When the U.S. lifted the ban , only half of the 124 chose to go home , but Red China decided to go after the entire Chinese student body in the U.S. Last March Peking began to register the students ' families , then launched its letters-from-home campaign . Red China not only needs the skills of these refugees ; it also wants to eliminate what could well become an effective group of well-educated counter-revolutionaries living in freedom abroad . <P> Over the months the letters have brought results . A subtle technique , as different from Russia 's brutish kidnapings as China is different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds of the students . They stir up traditional family loyalties , create doubts about each student 's place in an alien land . They offer bright promises for the future-and an end to all the frustrations and problems that beset the students . <P> The Rootless Ones . These problems provide fertile ground for exploitation . As long as the students stay in the U.S. , they live in a sort of no man 's land . Many have no legal status , are permitted to remain only on an indefinite basis . Some find it impossible to make plans or a decent living . Some are lonely ; there are about five male Chinese students to each female . " Many of them , " explains a Chinese professor now teaching in New Jersey , " have discarded Confucianism and have not acquired the Christian spirit of the Americans . The technology they have learned is not enough to substitute for the Chinese philosophy of life they threw away . "                   @ @
