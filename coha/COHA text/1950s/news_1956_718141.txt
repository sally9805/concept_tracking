txt It is nice to discover that a respectable slice of European opinions find our system of presidential nominating conventions praiseworthy , despite the noise and the confusion . For instance , the London Economist declared , back in 1952 : " The great strength of the American system , for all its turbulence , is that the long arm of the people 's choice can go deep into the barrel and pull out the best men available . . That 's fine as applied to Convention Week itself . But it 's that last hectic preconvention week that strains credulity and patience . For this is the time when rumor and gossip fly with the greatest of ease , when loud , last-minute jostlings for delegates can be heard on the stage behind the curtain which has n't gone up yet , and when the lack of big news in the press transforms each small political shift into a development of earthquakian importance . A A A Thus in the space of three days prior to the opening of the Democratic National Convention at Chicago the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefly across the entire land , wafted by a chain of newspapers , that Gov . Averell Harriman of New York had quit the presidential race , had folded his tent and retired to Albany . 2 . This was promptly denied by Governor Harriman 's astute campaign counselor , Carmine DeSapio , resplendent in white silk shirt and white silk tie , at a Chicago press conference . Mr. DeSapio labeled the rumor " either a Republican-inspired hoax or an act of desperation , conceived in the awareness that Harriman is gaining new support and new strength each hour . " 3 . Adlai E. Stevenson gave out with a civil-rights comment which was precisely in line with comments he had made before to the effect that the Democratic civil-rights plank should endorse the Supreme Court 's desegregation decision . But because he used the phrase " Supreme Court " ? allegedly " fighting words " to the South ? instead of something more marshmal- Detail from Scott Long . Minneapolis Morning Tribune lowish like " laws of the land , " a great hue and cry went up that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the southerners now would reject Mr. Stevenson . 4 . Sober , second-day appraisals indicated that the Stevenson band wagon had n't suffered much damage after all . Most southerners seemed aware that in Mr. Stevenson they had about as mild and moderate a candidate as they would get . 5 . A mellowed but still cocky Harry S. Truman , having a wonderful time and basking in Democratic glory , gave a classic political press conference in which he announced that he would state his choice of presidential nominee before Aug. 12 and smartly side-stepped all efforts to smoke him out in advance . Adding up all this , had the picture changed noticeably ? Had the Stevenson prospects been jeopardized , or the Harriman prospects altered ? It seemed not . A A A In Adlai Stevenson the Democratic Party has an able , articulate spokesman . He has not whipped up much enthusiasm in the Farm Belt , but he is the candidate most acceptable to Democrats of various shades and groupings in most parts of the country . He has learned to be a more effective campaigner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of believing personally that perhaps it would be a good thing for the Republicans to be in power for a while . Mr. Truman may or may not endorse Mr. Stevenson . But time passes and situations change . Mr. Stevenson has other strengths besides Mr. Truman . There is the quiet willingness of the strong southern coalition to " go along . " There is the backing of Democratic liberals such as Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota . Adlai Stevenson looms as a man the party can unite on . Traditionally , the Democrats like a fight and a scrimmage at their national convention . But in this period when the Republicans , despite Harold E. Stassen. seem to have their candidates picked , their platform already nailed together , and their campaign ready to launch , a divisive last-minute fight does n't loom as entirely attractive to a good many Democratic strategists . The Democratic need for unity ? suggests that the final ticket may be Stevenson and Humphrey , or Stevenson and some other liberal Democrat .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
