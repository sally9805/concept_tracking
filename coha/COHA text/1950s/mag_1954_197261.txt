All done up in Gandhi cap and grey cotton waistcoat , his legs wrapped spider-like in white churidhars , India 's Jawaharlal Nehru expounded his foreign policy last week before the Upper House of Parliament . " If coexistence is not possible , " said he , " then the only alternative is co-destruction . " The U.S. proposal for a Southeast Asia Treaty ( SEATO ) was " likely to change the whole trend towards peace that the Geneva Conference has created . . . Probably in America the crisis of our time is supposed to be Communism v. antiCommunism . The crisis in Asia is colonialism v. anti-colonialism . . . Was the tragic history of 7 years of war in Indo-China not due to an attempt to prolong the colonial era ? " It was the old familiar Nehru line ; his supporters had heard it before , and the public galleries were almost empty . <P> Then up rose a heavy-jawed , aging ( 61 ) and ailing man to answer the voice of India . Speaking badly but bluntly , " weaving no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ambedkar , nominal leader of India 's 60 million Untouchables , challenged the man he once served as Minister of Law . " Nobody wants war , " said Ambedkar , " but peace is being purchased at the price of partitioning countries . By this kind of peace , you are feeding the giant every time he opens his jaw . This giant may one day turn to us and say , T have now consumed everything . . . You are the only person who remains and now I want to consume you . ' <P> " By allowing the Chinese to take possession of Lhasa the capital of Tibet , the Prime Minister has practically helped them bring their border down to the Indian border . . . Aggression might well be committed by people who are always in the habit of committing aggression . <P> " The Prime Minister always says , ' Asia for the Asiatics , ' but more than half of Asia is Communist . . . There can be no unity . Therefore it is better for us to align ourselves with what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> He accused Nehru of having a " certain hostility " to the U.S. and a " repugnance " to U.S. proposals . <P> Next day Nehru spoke a little more moderately : " I have no desire . . . to moralize to anybody . I am deeply conscious of our own failings . " But the Nehru line , restated by his alter ego in foreign affairs , Krishna Menon , was unchanged . SEATO is " the modern version of a protectorate , " said Menon , dreamed up by imperialistic " outsiders " who were trying to dictate to the peoples of Asia .
