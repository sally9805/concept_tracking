Said Albert Clifford Ashforth , president of the Toronto-Dominion Bank : " Canadians never had it so good . In 1955 , they produced more , imported more , exported more , earned more , spent more , consumed more , borrowed more , saved more and invested more than in any previous year . " <P> If Ashforth sounded a little more like a barker making a midway spiel than a banker making a year-end report , he had good reason . Any Canadian taking stock of the nation 's economy at the close of 1955 was bound to be buoyant . The year had begun with some 500,000 unemployed , and with spreading fears that Canada 's postwar boom might be collapsing . Not only did such fears turn out to be unfounded , but 1955 turned out to be the best year Canada ever had . In Ottawa last week , the chief watchman of the country 's economy , Trade and Commerce Minister C.D. Howe , cited these indicators : <P> Canada 's gross national product is now running 11% above the record set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the output does not meet the demand . There are shortages of steel and cement for domestic use , and of newsprint , chemicals and metals for eager foreign customers . <P> Personal income went up 8% , and corporation profits before taxes 22% . With the cost-of-living index holding steady , every extra dollar of dividends or take-home pay bought a full dollar 's worth of goods . <P> Exports increased 12% , even though wheat , a major export in past years , was hard to sell in 1955 . Such new export items as uranium , iron ore and oil more than made up for the grain decline . <P> Imports rose 15% during the year , with nearly all of the increase in U.S. manufactured goods to satisfy the rapidly improving Canadian standard of living . <P> Unfilled Orders . In almost every part of the country , there was tangible evidence of industrial and business activity to back up Howe 's statistics . In the Quebec wilderness , 325 miles north of Montreal , Canadian National Railways is building a $35 million line to Chibougamau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the big Steel Co. of Canada , which has spent $100 million on new mills since 1950 , reported with rueful pride that it was a full year behind on some orders - and promptly laid on an additional $70 million expansion program . Western oil production increased nearly one-third during the year , and great new developments for Canada 's petroleum industry lay right ahead : a $350 million pipeline eastward and a $120 million line southward to carry natural gas to Eastern Canada and the Pacific Northwest . In British Columbia , the Aluminum Co. of Canada decided that the new $300 million Kitimat plant was already outgrown and launched a $200 million expansion . <P> As could be expected , such capital growth called for heavy investment . Canada 's busiest stock market , the Toronto Exchange , doubled its turnover of shares and share values during the year . About 85% of all the new investment was made by Canadians themselves , but foreign capital continued to flow into the country at a healthy rate , with full encouragement from the government . Said Minister Howe : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dollar bill . "
