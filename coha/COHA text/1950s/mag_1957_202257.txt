Acquitted last week by a Portland ( Ore. ) jury : Portland 's Democratic Mayor Terry Schrunk , an indignant witness before the McClellan committee ( TIME , March 18 ) , who had been charged with perjury in denying to a county grand jury that he had taken a gambler 's bribe while sheriff . Still ahead : trials on subornation of perjury and wiretap charges .
