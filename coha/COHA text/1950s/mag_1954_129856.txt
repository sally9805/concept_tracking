NEW ORLEANS The Southern Yacht Club on Lake Pontchartrain has been famous since 1849 for its hospitality and interest in yacht racing . Last week the club had the atmosphere of Mardi Gras , with a banquet , cocktail party , dance or crab broil going on every night . For 24 sailors , 8 skippers and their 16 crew members , however , it was also a deadly serious time . They were there to sail in the North American Yacht Racing Union 's third annual North American Sailing Championship for the Clifford D. Mallory Trophy . The winner is recognized as the top sailor of the United States and Canada . // FEW WERE CHOSEN // The eight skippers were the survivors of countless elimination races throughout the nation . Thousands of sailors , many of them with national reputations and including Cornelius ( " Corny " ) Shields , 1952 North American Sailing Champion , had been defeated along the way . // Of the eight skippers who sailed in the 1953 finals only one had been able to survive the eliminations this year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orleans , who had startled the yachting world last year by winning the Mallory Trophy at the age of 18 . He had done it the hard way , too , in the foreign waters of Long Island Sound and in keel boats , with which he was unfamiliar . Racing now on his own Lake Pontchartrain and in the Lightning Class boats which he has sailed for years , Gene Walet obviously was the man  --  or boy  --  to beat . // A good look at the talent arrayed against him might well have discouraged even a veteran champion . Best known of the contenders were Karl Smither of Buffalo and Henry ( Hank ) J. Cawthra of Detroit , both of whom have Lightning Class International Championships to their credit . Another big threat was William S. Cox of Darien , Conn. , 1930 National Junior Sailing Champion and four-time winner of the International One Design Class Championship on Long Island Sound . None of the other four was more of a dark horse than Walet had been the previous year . // When the series started on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure of crewing along with Walter Crump Jr. , got off to a flying start by taking the first race , passing Walet in the last hundred yards . By the halfway mark of the eight races , however , it was evident that young Gene was in a fair way to run away with the series . In light and variable conditions he showed shrewd judgment and amazing consistency by adding two firsts and a second to his opening second spot . This gave him a lead over Cox of 8 ? points and over Cawthra of 11. // Then Cawthra tightened matters . He won the next two races to come within 7 points of the leader and move 3 ? ahead of Cox . With only two races to go , however , Gene Walet would have had to blow sky high to have lost . And that 's something he has n't been known to do . Sailing conservatively , staying out of trouble and keeping a weather eye on his two chief rivals , he placed fifth and sixth  --  good enough to hold a 5-point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a fifth to nose out Cawthra by one point for the runner-up position . // In accepting the handsome Mallory Trophy , Gene paid tribute to his crew , Gilbert ( Gibby ) Friedrichs Jr . and Allen ( Pudgy ) McClure Jr . The three of them have sailed together for years , and a smoother working team has seldom been seen . // " As all sailors know , " Gene said , " I could n't have made it without a top crew and Gibby and Pudgy are the best there are . " // THE BEST MAN // A bit of the credit also belongs to Gene 's father , Eugene H. Walet Jr. , who used to crew for his son and who advised him on strategy in the last two races . After Gene 's victory the elder Walet remarked : " It took a lot of will power . Gene did n't sail his usual race . He took no chances of blowing it . And he won . " // There 's such a thing , though , as spreading the credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they had lost to the best skipper they ever had matched wits and tiller hands against . The Mallory Trophy , once the property of Admiral Lord Nelson , bears the Nelson motto which , freely translated from the Latin , reads : " Let the best man win . " For two years running he has done just that .
