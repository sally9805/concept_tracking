When the Texas legislature 's " little Kefauver committee " began snuffling about in search of scofflaws , it turned almost automatically on the Gulf Coast 's island city of Galveston ( pop . 65,000 ) - always one of the widest-open towns in the U.S. But Galveston 's politicos and gamblers betrayed neither the sheepish guilt , the sullen defiance nor the outraged innocence commonly shown by victims . <P> When questioned last week , they pitched on a bland , evangelistic tone , something like devotees of yoga telling a police judge why they had assumed the Lotus Position on a public street . Maceo &; Co. , Galveston 's biggest gamblers , voluntarily shut the town down . And 15 of its 16 partners ( some of whom belong to the chamber of commerce ) refused to talk for fear of selfincrimination .
