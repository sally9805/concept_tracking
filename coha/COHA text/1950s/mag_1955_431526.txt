 |p487  IN 1629 the Dutch ship Batavia , carrying immigrants to the Molucca Islands , was blown far from course and smashed onto , utman Rocks off western Australia . While the vessel 's master , Francis Pelsart , was away seeking help , a band of cutthroats ong the crew murdered many of their felw castaways , stole the ship 's chests of silver in , and plotted to seize the relief vessel for a career of piracy . Forewarned , Captain Pelsart on his return managed to outwit the mutineers . He summarily hanged all but two , who were abandoned on the mainland of Australia . White Man Meets His First Kangaroo The story of Captain Pelsart 's grim experience might well be forgotten today were it not t , , r the description in his journal of a strange animal he encountered in abundance on the rocky islets where he suffered shipwreck .

' he wrote . Today 's naturalists find this report singularly interesting , for it is the first authentic account of any member of the kangaroo family . Indeed , so accurate was the Dutch seaman 's description that his animal could be identified three centuries later as the Tammar wallaby , a small member of the kangaroo clan . Oddly enough , the wallabies were the first of the kangaroos that I met when I , too , went to Australia .

Kangaroos are vigorous modern members of the ancient order of animals known as marsupials , which take their name from a Latin word meaning " pouch . " The ones we know today carry their babies in pouches on their bellies . Long ago , during the later days of the dinosaurs , the marsupials were common mammals . Eventually , in most places , they were superseded by the more advanced animals that dominate the earth today ? the placental mammals that bear their young so well developed that they do not need pouches for protection . But in Australia , cut off from other continents ages ago , advanced types of mammals were excluded , and the marsupials continued to prosper . As a result , the continent remained a kind of natural zoo of primitive mammals , including not only the marsupials , but such oddities as the egg-laying platypus.t Kangaroos Come in Many Sizes Kangaroos lacked competition from hoofed animals such as deer , antelope , and bison , and had few enemies : thus they developed into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment : some climb trees ( page 495 ) some bound gracefully among rocks and cliffs with the sure-footedness of a chamois ; some prefer swamps ; some take kindly to the desert .

Kangaroos spend long periods washing catfashion , licking their forepaws and running them through their fur . They are timid creatures . One moment they may be wallowing peacefully in " nests " of sand or grass , or perching on their mulish haunches in the shade , twitching rabbitlike noses . The next moment they may be scattering in every direction , panicked by the alarm thump of a nervous doe who has caught sight of a wedge-tailed eagle circling high above .

To some observers it seems that they observe periods of rest between rounds , almost as if they were in the prize ring . But Marquis of Queensberry rules hold no place in a serious fight , when the old ' roo brings his hind legs into murderous play . Bracing on his massive tail , he unexpectedly lashes out with both legs . A long clawlike nail on the middle toe of each hind foot rips fur and flesh , and the savagery of the kicks quickly discourages all but the hardiest foes ( page 497 ) .

When Captain Pelsart examined his first wallabies more than three centuries ago , he quite understandably assumed that the young was born within the pouch . He believed that it developed from the mother 's nipple , to which he found it so firmly attached . Even today some people of the Australian outback accept this explanation of marsupial birth . The true story is almost as remarkable as Captain Pelsart 's fancy . A kangaroo 's joey is born in essentially the same fashion as other mammals , but at an extremely early stage of development . Even in the largest variety of kangaroo he is a mite of a creature ? less than an inch long , blind , hairless , and so pink as ' to seem half transparent . At this stage other mammalian infants are still being fed in the womb by means of the placenta , a marvelous structure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that of the baby . But the joey 's mother has no true placenta . Thus when the infant has absorbed all the nourishment in the yolk sac that surrounds his small body , he must go in search of his mother 's milk . Young Joey Makes a Hazardous Trip Once ushered into the outer world , the joey does not tarry long . Keen instinct urges him forward on his first and most critical journey in search of food and shelter . The momentary waif uses his strong and already clawed forelimbs , much better developed at this stage than the hind limbs and tail , to Though outweighed by the great gray , the red is the tallest kangaroo .

Safely inside , the joey clamps his mouth over one of the nipples , which swells to form an almost unbreakable bond ( page 490 ) . To prevent the milk from straying into the lungs and choking him , the infant possesses an exceptional tubular arrangement leading from the nose passages directly to the windpipe and lungs . Thus he can continue to breathe normally while avidly drinking down his milk . Now the joey develops fur , and his hind limbs and tail ? insignificant structures when he entered the pouch ? grow faster than the rest of the body , becoming the powerful organs of locomotion that are the trademark of his clan . After about three months the young kangaroo may venture into the outer world to try his legs and sample tender young grasses and leaves . But at the slightest sign of danger he dives back into the pouch , tumbling in head-first with legs and tail projecting from his mother 's elastic crib like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 489 ) . Hunters who bring down a female kangaroo after a long chase seldom find a large joey in the pouch . The doe has usually lightened herself for flight by tossing the joey into a thicket . She thus improves her chances of escaping and returning , and if she is killed the youngster may still have a chance to live . When the joey is too large to fit comfortably into the pouch , mamma decides that she has had enough . She ejects the burdensome offspring for good , cuffing him soundly as he tries to climb back in till he realizes he is no longer wanted . Sounds in the Night Kangaroos are not the easiest animals to observe , as I soon found out when the Arnhem Land Expedition reached Darwin , on Australia 's northern coast . We took quarters in a tourist camp at Night Cliff , outside Darwin , waiting for cooler winds from the southeast to extinguish the torrential rains and usher in the long dry season of bright days and starry nights . Between showers I got my first look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grass four feet higher than a man 's head , and twisting coastline of mangrove swamps , rocky headlands , and white sand beaches . In the darkness of the first night a series of quick thuds told of some creature running through the tangle of dripping scrub outside my cabin . I went out with my flashlight. hoping to glimpse the noisy phantom , but in vain . Next morning I found many sets of wallaby tracks in the muddy jungle paths . on the wet sand of the beach , and in the mud under the salt-water mangroves , proving that several dozen of the creatures lived within half a mile of our cabins . But on my first attempts to glimpse them , my only reward was to see a sudden writhing of the dank grass or a vaguely defined flash of brown hurtling into a thicket . @# Speed , Agility Mark Sandy Wallaby Gradually my perception sharpened .

This was the sandy wallaby , an elegantly trim little creature with a snowy-white chest and a narrow white crescent over each hip . To me he will always typify the great and varied family of kangaroos , even more than the majestic great gray . Speed and agility are the sandy 's outstanding attributes ; in recognition of this his species bears the Latin name agilis . He can hide behind a tuft of grass , then take off with the thudding scurry , burst of speed , and nimble dodging that have saved his kind from many a white man 's bullet and black man 's spear . These tactics protect him also from more ancient enemies still on hand to persecute him ? the dingoes , or wild dogs , the wedge-tailed eagles , and the big green rock python .

As " hopping mutton " he appears regularly on many a more formal table at missions , cattle  |p496  stations , and mining camps . Loin and tail ( for soup ) are specially prized ; other parts are generally coarse and gamy . One evening we camped west of Melville Bay by a stream the natives called Kwaiturumuru . A wallaby had been killed by one of the natives for the evening meal , and as usual I intended to save its skin and skull as scientific specimens . Since it was a female . I looked into the pouch : sure enough , there was the limp body of a joey about eight inches long . It would make a fine addition to my collection of pouch young , I thought . Suddenly a small black hand darted into the pouch and seized the joey . I found myself engaged in a struggle for possession of the prized specimen .

" Piston Legs Carry a Red Across Sun-baked Plains at 30 Miles an Hour In Australia 's outback , where forage is sparse and water holes far apart , the kangaroo must roam vast distances . He does so in soaring broad jumps , forepaws tucked in , and head and tail in balance . To make this sequence , the photographer paced the kangaroo in an automobile .  |p497  Later , over the campfire , our guide explained that I had unknowingly run up against tribal custom . According to complex rules that govern the division of food after a successful hunt , joeys from the pouch always go to the children .

The quavering voice of the storyteller of the moment rose and fell , accompanied by the rhythmic " clack-clack , clack-clack " of beaten sticks , as he gave his version of the hunt and added his hit to the evening 's entertainment . An occasional burst of shrill laughter from the appreciative audience revealed that the natives ' sharp eyes had missed nothing of the white man 's awkward ways in their homeland . Near Yirrkala , our and base camp , there bigger game in the kangaroo line . Back from the coast a mile or so . where the flat interior plateau falls off in a series of ironstone bluffs and narrow ravines , live the great red wallaroos . Unlike the plains-dwelling red kangaroos and the grays of the open woodlands , the wallaroos prefer rock-studded slopes . In keeping with this habitat , they have comparatively short legs , thick necks , and sturdy bodies , and their movements have an air of stolid deliberation . It is an impressive sight when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a creek bottom water hole , clumps off upslope to lose himself among tumbled rimrock boulders where pursuit is impossible . With a full schedule of other field work to attend to , I found that wallaroo hunting took time out of all proportion to its rewards . So I turned over the job of getting specimens to a native named Marguri , to his great pleasure . Marguri knew the measurements I wanted , but was baffled by the millimeter measuring tape . At first , therefore , I insisted that he bring each wallaroo into camp , where I could measure it in the flesh . This , of course , made hard work for the hunter , for some of the Boxers Aim for the Solar Plexus .

Playful young kangaroos love to box ( page 491 ) .  |p499  animals weighed more than 100 pounds , and often they were killed miles from camp . Eventually I devised a system by which Marguri brought each neatly rolled skin with a slender pole cut to the exact length of the wallaroo and notched to show the other measurements . I suspected that Marguri was pleased with this system for more than one reason : he no longer had to divide the meat in the presence of his wife 's numerous relatives , nor did he have to give a generous share to the expedition 's cook . At Oenpelli , where rocky Inyalark Hill loomed close to the expedition 's green tents , I made the acquaintance of the rock wallaby , a confirmed cliff dweller . Our anthropologists , sketching aboriginal rock paintings , found these wallabies skipping like little ghosts through the labyrinth of galleries and fissures formed by tumbled rock slabs . I spent many a delightful hour watching the sprites of Inyalark Hill at their play . Imagine an animal not much larger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gray luster of chinchilla , its powerful hind legs equipped with nonskid treads , its long tail seeming not to taper at all . This acrobat has absolutely no fear of heights . It creeps weasellike through narrow fissures in rocks and makes flying leaps across impossible chasms . To traverse a floorless hallway of its home or to ascend a narrow chimney , it may ricochet like a bullet from wall to wall , finding momentary support for its glancing weight on ledges no broader than a man 's finger . Except for the rock python , few enemies threaten this wallaby . Even the resourceful aborigines balk at hunting him . A thrown spear that misses its mark is likely to be splintered on a rock or lost in a deep crevice . After we finished our work at Oenpelli , I bade the other expedition members goodbye Hopei walker , National Geographic Staff Chasm Island Cliffs on Grasshopper Legs and set off to visit the arid center of Australia .

Swift Runner of the Plains The red kangaroo is the fleet-footed runner of the undulating , rusty-colored barren heart of Australia . In this land of sparse forage and widely separated water holes , he must cover vast distances in order to survive , just as do the Old World gazelles and the American pronghorn antelopes in their own , equally dry , habitats .

As we puffed out of the desert station , a big red kangaroo rose from his rest in the sparse shade of an isolated tree and loped alongside the train . Slender neck and tail straight out . legs working in unison , he kept easy pace with us in long , effortless bounds . With true Australian hospitality the big red was escorting the departing guest on the first mile of his homeward journey .
