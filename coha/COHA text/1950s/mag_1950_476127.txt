THE bar of the Caribe-Hilton in San Juan was full of army men , homeward bound from the biggest combined maneuver ever held by American armed forces . At one table a naval officer said to his companions : " Drink up and let 's go . I do n't think we 're very welcome around here . " A captain with the blue-and-white patch of the 3rd Division on his shoulder addressed his daiquiri morosely : " Why the hell do we have to go to the Marines to learn how to make landings ? The only people who looked any good were the Puerto Ricans . " In the wardroom of a carrier , an Air Force officer laid down his fork . " If you navy files think you have technical troubles , " he said , " you you ought to go out to Fort Knox and talk to the Armored Force boys . The Russians are ten years ahead of them . " In those three remarks , and the annotations to them , can be summed up the results of Portrex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our national defenses ; actually , it was supposed to be a good deal more ? a demonstration that last year 's revolution of the admirals has been forgotten and a combination training exercise , field experiment with new weapons , and Greatest Show on Earth . Over six hundred guests , including thirteen women correspondents , were invited to see it . They will probably never see anything like it again . For what Portrex did demonstrate is that , although there is excellent co-operation among the services in the operational commands , there are still basic differences at the high levels ; that the technique of war has changed as much since 1945 as it did between 1920 and 1940 ; that we need outside help in defending America , and can probably get it if we ask for it ? and finally , that publicity stunts seldom pay . The last point was demonstrated by an occurrence which gave Portrex the only poor press it deserved and , as it was an isolated case , had better be taken up at once . Part of the D-day program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vieques , the island at the eastern end of Puerto Rico . The parachutists themselves wanted to come down in the hill country well behind the beachhead , where , in a tactical sense , they could mess up the defenders ' communications without running into prepared defenses and , in a practical sense , they would have good ground to land on . But someone nixed this because the jump would then be out of sight from the bleachers where the guests were installed . So the parachutists came down close behind the beaches , on stony ground and in the midst of a complex of blockhouses that in a real war would have wiped them out . Some 10 per cent of them ( the Puerto Rican papers put the figure a't. " over sixty-five " ) suffered injuries ranging from sprained ankles to broken legs and backs . This looks pretty bad but , without excusing it , a certain number of physical casualties are inseparable from a maneuver where a reasonable attempt is made to simulate the realities of war . A couple of them also occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and the men had to jump over the side ; all the carriers had more or less serious deck crashes while operating planes in the high gales and heavy seas which marked the first week of the operation . As a matter of fact , the parachutists were fairly lucky . The Puerto Rican soldiers of the 65th Infantry , who were the major defenders of Vieques , took realism so seriously that in the area where the parachutists had wanted to land , palm trees had been cut down at about waist height and the stumps sharpened . The 65th also took matters seriously in other respects . Ordered to set up beach defenses , they built concrete and coconut-log bunkers so well sited , so thoroughly dug in , that the umpires ( who had seen a lot of this sort of thing in the Pacific war ) perceived that the landing forces would be cut to pieces . They ruled about half the blockhouses blown up , supposedly as the result of " naval gunfire . " Now it is very doubtful whether naval gunfire would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the umpires had to ascribe damage to something or call off the war , and as there were no heavy bombers present they chose the guns . This does not alter the lesson that the Japanese type of defensive engineering , which made such memorable names of Tarawa and Iwo Jima , has been developed far beyond what it was in Japanese hands . II T HE absence of heavy bombers takes us to the planning of the Portrex operation and to some carefully smoothed-over differences of opinion in the Pentagon . Without allowing themselves to be quoted , army men have made it clear that they considered the whole thing unreal , a preparation only for the special conditions that existed in the Pacific during the war . There was ( they say ) little room for maneuver and none at all for the surprise that can be gained by strikingat an unexpected point ; and future operations will stand little chance of success unless they can be based on movement and surprise . Still , they did want to challenge the Marines ' monopoly as beachhead soldiers and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tropical country , about intelligence and counter-intelligence of the types a potential enemy might use . This comes down to saying that for the Army , Portrex was more a training exercise than a maneuver ; the enlisted and company officers were supposed to pick up a good deal , but officers in the higher ranks were not expecting to change many of their doctrines as the result of anything that happened . The participation of the Air Force was even more tentative . A small , solidly defended and vital area , as Vieques was supposed to be , would offer a natural target for atom-bomb attack , and it appears that a simulated atombomb drop was discussed during the planning phase ? and then abandoned . So were heavy bombers of any kind , and the Air Force was represented only by some tactical support planes and two squadrons of jet fighters . ( Incidentally , the Marine aviators who were with the defense forced down some of these jets , kept the pilots as prisoners , plastered the planes with Marine recruiting posters , and sent them back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-operation but took little opporqmity of trying to learn anything either from experiment or training . The Navy also wanted training , but in addition it was conducting major experi , ments . The postwar years have provided the sea service with far more unsolved problems than either Army or Air Force . It wanted to know whether troop convoys could be rammed home in the face of the new submarines , using tactics only partially developed at the end of the war ; whether the new submarines could co-ordinate their activities with those of the planes ; how much of a menace were planes carrying the new guided missiles ; and how effective were the postwar anti-submarine devices . Tests on some of these points had already been held in the November maneuvers , but they were held off Labrador , under sub-Arctic conditions , and it seemed probable that the results would not hold good for more genial waters . T nus Portrex was to a large extent the Navy 's show , and this background was responsible for many of its arrangements and artificialities . The script was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " hasreached the Western hemisphere and has powerfully fortified Vieques Island , which is theoretically the projection of a far larger land mass . There is also an Aggressor air base at Bermuda . The American mission is to take Vieques . For this purpose , there would sail from Norfolk an " attack force , " consisting of the battleship Missouri , three cruisers , and some destroyers , to soften up the landing area by bombardment ; a slow convoy , carrying supplies and protected ' by a light carrier ; a fast convoy , carrying troops and covered by another light carrier ; a fast carrier task force , consisting of three big carriers , one of them the giant Franklin D. Roosevelt . Two hunterkiller anti-submarine groups , each composed of an escort carrier and seven speciallyequipped destroyers , would hunt Aggressor submarines , being assisted by blimp patrols from the Carolinas and seaplanes from Norfolk . I was with one of the hunter-killer groups , aboard U.S.S. Mindoro , CVE , and thanks to a mess-officer who had a proper taste in groceries , ate filet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the enthusiastic Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry , with some supporting units ; eleven submarines , most of them of the snorkel type ; two seaplane tenders with their broods of patrol planes ; six squadrons of land-based patrol planes capable of carrying guided missiles or torpedoes ; and some Marine air units , mainly fighters . Aboard every ship and in every air operation were the umpires , who decided how much damage had been inflicted according to formulas , and who had a whole band of radio circuits available only to them for rapid communication . Great pains were taken to give the maneuver realism . The Aggressors had their own uniforms , insignia , and markings for their planes . They even conducted propaganda operations on behalf of their own philosophy ; as the 3rd Division hit the beaches , the attackers were greeted by loudspeakers saying ; " How would you like a nice , cool beer ? Drop your gun and step this way . " And they found every available flat surface plastered with posters proclaiming " Bic BROTHER Is WATCHING You , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and battlefield sound devices were used without convincing anybody much , but the physical contacts at sea were close to the real thing . When a submarine intended to torpedo a ship , she fired a shot from a water-filled torpedo tube with a green flare that would come up close aboard the victim ; when a plane or destroyer went after a submarine , it dropped a noise-making device decidedly audible to those inside the iron box , and the umpire aboard required the submarine to surface and identify herself . The rules were that when any ship , plane , or man was declared out of action ? sunk , destroyed , or killed ? he ( it ) could no longer send nor receive messages , nor substantially alter position for four hours . At this time a convenient resurrection allowed the show to go on . Neither side knew the other 's initial plans in any but the most general terms and when the intelligence operation got under way toward the end of January , each was allowed to use any of the devices of war to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field they were never to lose by sending a WAC of their own forces into Norfolk . She got a job as a waitress and pumped officers for enough information to have brought any expedition to grief . III T HE war began at noon on February 22 , at which time the fleet was just outside Norfolk , heading southeastward . That first night there was an incident which had in it something both of the reality of war and the artificiality of maneuvers . Two unidentified planes were reported close in on the carrier , and five minutes later one of the umpires walked into the wardroom to announce cheerfully , " The Mindoro is sunk ; hit by two major guided missiles . " When you attack a vigorous and reasonably alert enemy , you expect some losses and hope from your techniques only to keep them as low as possible . But this was surprise against a force that was itself taking the offensive ? a baby Pearl Harbor in reverse though no one was physically hurt ? and it led to some fairly sharp questionings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible . At the opening of operations , the big fast carriers ran south and east to strike at the Bermuda airfields and to interpose a moving screen of force between the Aggressor planes and our slower formation , which was coasting down the Carolinas . This was a reasonable and logical strategy , which no doubt would have worked in a shooting war . But the tourist season was on in Bermuda , and the hotel-keepers did n't want their customers annoyed by the midnight roar of airplane engines , so that although theoretically based on that vacation island the Aggressor planes actually flew out from North Carolina . They thus struck us instead of the moving screen of force they were looking for . One of the pilots reported he had made a hit on the major carrier Philippine Sea . But after you are dead , it does n't help much to learn that they killed the wrong man . Why did n't we have any planes up to keep those guided-missile-carriers at a distance ? Because , as was noted by the walrus and the carpenter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the small type of escort carrier had over twenty planes , half of them fighters . The major changes of the postwar years have brought it about that today a big escort carrier ? and Mindoro is one of the biggest , built on a tanker hull ? can carry and operate no more than sixteen planes , none of them fighters . We had eighteen aircraft aboard , including the helicopter that ran errands and picked up aviators who made errors of judgment on takeoff and landing . This seems like very few planes for a ship as big as a heavy cruiser , with a crew of over a thousand men , but it is only one instance of the prodigious mechanization , the reliance on an ever-increasing number of gadgets , that has come over the whole art of war in the past five years . Mindoro carries anti-submarine planes , which are no longer the relatively simple wartime types with a pilot , a radioman , and a bomb-bay full of depth charges . This anti-submarine plane has to carry two or three kinds of radios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and destroyers of the unit , since the submarine has become so tough that it can be dealt with only by cooperative enterprise . The plane must carry a big radar and counter-radar , including the device which enables it to home on an unseen submarine which is using its own radar ? so much radar that there is a big egg-shaped bulge below the fuselage of the plane and a third member of the crew to do nothing but operate the equipment ? so much radar that the plane can carry neither offensive nor defensive weapons , and the task of hunting submarines has to be split between two planes , working together . One of them has nothing but radar and radio ; the other , nothing but depth charges , rockets , and a very deadly device known as " the pickle , " whose precise nature is still a secret . All this load has made the planes so big and so heavy that there just is n't room for more than sixteen of them on an escort carrier . Well , why not replace a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up at this point . These planes are filled with complex and delicate machinery ; they are required to make landings on the decks of carriers which are always moving in at least one direction , often very violently . The effect on the internal machinery of the planes can be approximated by throwing your radio across the room twice a day . Electrical connections break , tubes blow , and things get out of order generally . The repair gang on the hangar deck was the largest single group of men aboard the ship , but even so , there were rarely more than eight planes wholly fit foraction , four of them currently in the air , and four getting ready to fly as soon as the others were taken aboard . Mindoro could carry fighters to protect herself against air attack only at the price of abdicating part of her mission to protect other ships against submarines . Maybe one of the big carriers could do both jobs , but using such a ship on anti-submarine work would be enormously expensive . ( In fact , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enormous cost of mechanized war . The planes aboard , with their equipment , cost more than enough to have bought the whole ship and everything in her in 1941 , whether the purchasing unit were figured in dollars or man-hours of labor . ) UT a carrier does have guns for self-protection and the destroyers of her screen have a good many more . Using modern fire controls and shells with proximity fuses , they would be no inconsiderable defenses against planes hampered by the weight of guided missiles and forced by the necessity of launching them to fly at consistent altitudes , speeds , and directions . Later in the maneuver , several such planes were ruled shot down when umpires aboard the ships heard the order promptly given to open fire . Why was no such order given aboard Mindoro as soon as the planes appeared on the radar screen ? The answer to this one is not merely a matter of one occurrence aboard one ship , but a fundamental of the national defense setup today . It was already too late to do anything when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screen . This should not have been so . Mindoro is equipped with a longrange air search radar , not indeed of the latest model , but good enough to have given warning of the approach of those planes fifteen or twenty minutes before they reached position for the release of their missiles . Why was there no warning ? Not because of any man 's failure , but because the radar itself was not working at full capacity . This was known , but there was no one aboard with the necessary technical skill to persuade that instrument to operate at its peak efficiency . We had numerous radar technicians on the ship , and those who handled other types of radar , like the kind that searches the surface of the sea , were extremely good ; Mindoro 's surface search radar got the best results of any ship in the fleet . But there is as much difference between this type and the long-range air job as there is between a Jeep and a Packard . The procedures that work beautifully for one will have no application to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either robot is quite literally a matter of years . The Navy complains that by the time it has trained men to such jobs , their enlistments expire ; they slip out of the service into civilian employments at fancy salaries , and they do n't come back . Maybe so ; it would be comforting to believe that there is a reserve of trained technicians in the country who could be dug out in an emergency . But there is no indication that this is true ; the scientists are turning out new robots faster than the men can be trained to keep them working . Moreover , many of the skills needed are of little value to a civilian . The Army would like to train bright young men in the handling of 3.5-inch military rockets , a highly technical calling , but it has few inducements to offer them unless they intend to make a career in the service . The scientists have provided us with frightening new weapons , but they have n't told us how to find people to take care of them . IV T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services seems con- vinced that our only superiority over the Russians is technical . The common attitude is a kind of grim expectancy , so different . from the 1940 nonchalance with which the prospect of a Japanese war was regarded that it may go too far in the opposite direction . In the wardrooms of the ships , in the tents on the beaches , no question was more frequently asked of guests than , " When do you think Uncle Joe is going to jump ? " One night an order came over the umpires ' radio circuit that the war would be off for three hours , while all submarines came to the surface and identified themselves . It turned out that one of them had been in underwater collision with something that might have been another submarine and proved to be a fish ; but the reaction to the original order was , " Found one too many submarines operating in thearea , did they ? " or " Oh-oh , here goes N.Vorld War III . " The general set-up of the Portrex problem , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with planes and numerous submarines , had an obvious slant . So did the conclusion most often drawn from the results ? that such an operation would be a very rough and dangerous business , attended by heavy losses . It was pointed out that snooping planes have solved the main difficulty the Germans ran into , that of finding convoys for the submarines to attack , and that the new submarines are harder to find , harder to dig out once they are found . Any suggestion that Soviet submariners might not be quite as efficient as our own is met with , " No one can afford to be over-confident . " This is no doubt a healthy attitude for the services to take , but it seemed to what I hope was not a prejudiced observer that the antisubmarine forces had the edge . The U-boats could make nothing whatever of the fast carrier task force ; and , though they received credit for knocking off several ships in the convoys , most of the submarines had been " sunk " at least once by the time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and search teams from the hunter-killer groups did most of the work , in spite of the fact that over half the flyers were the young aviators the Navy now calls " midshipmen , " who had never made night landings on carrier decks before . Night landings are an eerie business , incidentally , and illustrate the point that mechanization has increased rather than diminished the need for human skill . There are no moon and no stars ; sea and sky are black ; the ship is dark , except for a single red masthead light and the feebly illuminated wands of the landing officer on his little platform at the stern ; a destroyer shows another red masthead light off tlI. starboard quarter . The plane takes its bearing on the two lights and comes tearing in with an angry roar , hoping that Mama 's deck will be there when he sets down . About twice out of three times one of the planes would have to take a wave-off and circle round again , but there was only one accident and nobody hurt . Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ilk'sHARPER 'S MAGAZINE trated by the day of the Big Kill . Six submarines surfaced during the night to hear the news from their shore headquarters and to make arrangements for a wolf-pack attack on the fast convoy the next day . The flagship received its instructions in code , but then passed orders to the rest of the gang by shortrange voice radio . Unknown to any of them , a destroyer of our force was within eavesdropping distance in the dark . The consequence was that the fast convoy changed course , and in the place where the submarines expected to find it , the hunterkiller groups found them . The wind was blowing a gale , with seas so high that the escort carriers could not operate planes nor the blimps come out to join them . But with destroyers alone the hunter-killer groups accounted for five of the six submarines in a twelve-hour stretch . As this imposed four hours of immobility on the submarines , they never came up with the convoy until it was unloading troops . At this point they redeemed somewhat by getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a supply ship , and the unfortunate Missouri . Just how they made the penetration is enough of a mystery to indicate that there has been improvement its submarine as well as anti-submarine technique , for the transport area was surrounded by a patrolled sonar-buoy barrape. 0 A sonar buoy is a floating object about three-and-a-half feet long and about eight inches through . It has mechanical ears below the surface , arranged to pick up the sound of a submarine 's propellers. and a tiny radio in the . upper part which broadcasts this sound on a. given frequency , different for each buoy . Patrolling planes pick up the sound . ( The listening equipment is still another item an anti-submarine plane must carry . ) The submarine has no means of locating the sonar buoy and does n't even know it 's being heard . In laying a barrage , a line of eight or nine sonar buoys is dropped . forming a net which the submarine can not penetrate without revealing its presence . A plane flies along overhead , tuning from one frequency to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he whistles in the nearest destroyer . During the war these buoys were used extensively with great success , and in last year 's maneuvers the submarines never succeeded in penetrating a buoy barrage . But now they seem to have learned how to get through , and we shall have to think of something new . Thus the Navy , which put the most into the maneuver , got the most out of it . The criticisms were mainly that a new doctrine needed to be developed somewhere , or a new device , or some kind of technical training . In contrast , the army troops showed the need of basic drill in blocking and tackling . The 3rd Division came ashore all right , but afterward they bunched up in a manner that would have cost them heavily had the guns been real . A Marine officer among the observers ( who had been at Saipan and Iwo Jima ) remarked that the artillery came in far too early and that the beachhead would have been the most awful mess in Christ 's kingdom unless they had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that the attack forces treated the operation more as a run around the infield than as a practice game . r inE Puerto Ricans of the defense forces , who began by building beach installa- . tions that were really impregnable , went on behaving as though they were in the business of blood , sweat , and tears . Their camouflage was excellent , their fields of fire were properly arranged , and they did not mind staying up all night . At one point they drove in a flank 50 neatly that the umpires had to call an armistice so that the invasion could proceed on schedule . They also put on an intelligence offensive rather alarmingly like what we should have to expect in World War III . A soldier dressed in a captured uniform and carrying a package turned up with a plausible story about delivering it to General Clarkson , commanding the ground forces of the invasion . He talked his way past four sentries to make the delivery , and when the general opened up the package a lot of smoke came out ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , along with his entire staff , the supreme invasion commander , and the admiral commanding the naval support forces . In the journalistic sense , the hottest story of Portrex is thus about spies , saboteurs , intelligence , and counter-intelligence . But I am not sure that it is the most important story . At the close of the proceedings , the services announced that Mr. Johnson 's economies had made it necessary for them to withdraw everything but housekeepers from the Caribbean area . Now people down that chain of islands have the liveliest memory of what happened the last time there were no American defense forces to speak of in the area . The date was 1942 , the German submarines came in on them , and they nearly starved , for in spite of the bounty of the tropics the bulk of their food is imported . Moreover , the Latin Americans have not missed the implications of World War H as to the fate of small nations in the face of big aggressors . They are all citizens of small nations ; they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any posters to remind them that Big Brother Is Watching . It is not only the Puerto Ricans whn take defense seriously . Around officers ' clubs one hears remarks like , " I 've never seen any cleaner ships than the Chileans keep , " " Those Peruvians have turned into pretty good little submarine men , " and " The Brazilian Air Force pilots are pretty hot . " The problem of the small nations is that they know very well they lack the industrial and scientific background to put up any kind of fight in a mechanized war . They have to have help ? radar , rockets , tanks , submarines , and maintenance men . But it seems to me the performance of the 65th Infantry demonstrates that being given that help , the Latin Americans have not only the willingness , but also the capacity , to take care of their own defense and some of ours , too ; and that we shall greatly gain by taking them into the firm as partners , instead of trying to play Big Brother ourselves .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
