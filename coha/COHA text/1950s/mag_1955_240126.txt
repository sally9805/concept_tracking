Spare the Freud and save the child , says Dr. Douglas McGlashan Kelley , professor of criminology at the University of California , who was chief psychiatrist at the Nrnberg trials . Misunderstanding and misapplication of Freudian theory , Dr. Kelley told a summer session at Fresno State College last week , have made parents neurotically fearful of turning their children into neurotics . As a result , he said , the U.S. today may be producing a smaller proportion of neurotics , but it is harvesting a bumper crop of psychopaths , which is worse . <P> It is the nature of every infant , said Dr. Kelley , to believe that the world revolves around him and especially his digestive tract ; as a growing child , he can not distinguish between fantasy and reality , he lacks emotional control , and , being inexperienced in the world 's ways , he can not make sound critical judgments . <P> With reasonable parental instruction and discipline , nearly everybody outgrows or learns to control these traits . But if children carry them over uncontrolled into adult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * An active , severe defect , said Dr. Kelley , may lead directly to crime-a simple example of " sees what he wants and takes it . " <P> Besides love and security , says Dr. Kelley , a youngster needs simple corporal punishment . This should change after age seven or so to adult types of punishment - fines and loss of privileges , always with reasoned explanations . If the child is not secure , Dr. Kelley conceded , the controls may make him neurotic . But that fear , first sown by Freud , has run wild through U.S. education and childrearing . The result : " A generation of children who have not been taught the discipline required for getting along with the world . " <P> " At present , " said Dr. Kelley , " our general approach is opposed to the totalitarian pattern and emphasizes freedom of speech , lack of obsessive rituals and minimal demands on behavior .

The ideal solution would be neither too much nor too little training suppression . Since nobody knows how much is too much , if we err , let it be on the side of potential neuroses . Perhaps thus we can make our world a better place in which to live ... If we do not choose some risk of creating neuroses , we ... increase our delinquency and criminal rates . " <P> *Serious character defects mark what used to be called the " constitutional psychopathic inferior , " more recently known simply as the psychopath ( and some experts want to change it again to " sociopath " ) Commonest feature : utter selfishness , in which the victim knows the difference between right and wrong but does not care .
