This is the story of the second Yankee invasion of Staunton , Virginia , a pretty red-brick-andwhite-frame Shenandoah Valley town . It came about when the American Safety Razor Corporation , of Brooklyn , New York , caught in the squeeze between mounting costs and competitive prices , moved South and invited its 1423 employees to move with it . More than a hundred accepted , and Staunton has n't seen so much excitement since Sheridan 's cavalry prowled the Valley in 1864 . It had been obvious for years to American Safety Razor , which manufactures razors and brushes as well as blades , that something wouldhave to be done to keep advancing costs from overtaking the prices being set by competitors . The solution was obviously a more efficient and economical manufacturing setup , and this eventually led A.S.R. to Staunton and the blending of two diverse cultures . Thousands of similar moves have marked industry 's postwar growth , but the very nature of these two protagonists make their union outstanding . Brooklyn and Virginia are both such dedicated chauvinists that relatives on each side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasted two years and might turn into one of the great love affairs of our time . This took a lot of doing , for Staunton is not an industrial town and does n't particularly care to be one . It wants a smattering of industry to balance its economy , but it has flourished since 1732 on orchards , livestock , agriculture and light manufacturing and as an educational center . " What it boiled down to , " as Sidney Wed , A.S.R. 's president expressed it , " was that Staunton did n't actually need the money , and we were glad of it . We want to be accepted as people , not tolerated as a payroll , so we muted our statistics and flaunted our charms . " It was an enlightened approach for a firm which had been wallowing in so many facts and figures during the preceding years that there were suggestions  --  not entirely facetious  --  that an abacus should be emblazoned on the corporate seal . The ancestral fact was that the company 's eight-story Brooklyn plant would have to be abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by industrial engineers , was that multiple stories , like butlers , were a by-gone luxury . The second reason , which made the first academic , was that New York City was preparing to condemn the factory as part of a Civic Center project for the burgeoning Borough of Brooklyn . Development of this huge municipal project  --  restricted to public buildings , educational institutions , parks , plazas , possibly an occasional statue of Pee Wee Reese  --  had been delayed by the war , but by 1953 the bulldozers were at the gates and A.S.R. knew for certain that it was living on borrowed time . It was move or else . The first step in making an industrial move is precisely the same as the first step in making hasenpfeffer  --  get your rabbit  --  so the company authorized a firm of industrial engineers to analyze its financial and production situation and submit an advisory report on a new plant . The report was submitted early in 1954 and coincided with the first of two lucky breaks that mitigated , to some extent , the rigors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old plant , with a three-year lease-back provision , to the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn , a legitimate tenant of the Civic Center development . The lease-back arrangement gave the company three invaluable years to find a new home . Beyond this happy juxtaposition , however , the report gave little cause for rejoicing . Starting with the absolutely minimal requirements of 300,000 square feet on one floor , a railway siding and room to expand , the engineers had laid out an ideal production facility with only one serious defect  --  it would cost between five and six million dollars . " Building it , " says George Bran , Jr. , assistant to the president and in general charge of relocation , " would have meant jumping from the frying pan into the fire  --  from a wasteful factory to an extravagant debt . So I got on the train . " The first train he hoarded was the subway . A.S.R. wanted to stay in Brooklyn , its home for over half a century , and Mr. Bratt felt that somewhere in that sprawling borough  --  certainly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would meet the company 's requirements . There was n't . Mr. Hyatt took to the Pullmans when A.S.R. openly entered the market for a factory . Prior to that it had dealt sorb roes or through intermediaries . Once the secret was out , it got sales pitches from all over the country . " We had written real-estate men , railroads , banks , utility companies , even our own dealers , " Mr. Bratt recalls with a shudder , " and traveled so much my family got the impression I 'd been made sales manager . We were oscillating between Florence , Alabama , and Vincennes , Indiana , when we got the news that changed the whole picture . " The eventful news was that the Celanese Corporation of America had lowered the asking price on a factory it owned in Staunton . Built in 1947 as a pilot plant to devise new uses for Celanese yarns and fibers in the textile industry , it had been relinquished when the job was done . A.S.R. had refused it , reluctantly , at $2,600,000 , but at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargain . " So we offered an even million , " says Mr. Bran , " just to start the conversation , and darned if we did n't get it fora million one hundred and fifty thousand . I put my suitcase in the attic and thought our troubles were over . " Actually they were just starting , for in transferring its operations A.S.R. ran into labor troubles . A new contract was drawn that provided for a gradual transfer to Staunton and uninterrupted production during the remainder of the stay in Brooklyn . Contingent upon the signing of this contract was a company proposal for easing the transfer . It had three basic provisions . The first guaranteed a comparable job in Staunton to any employee who followed the company ; paid all moving expenses , including cost of a preliminary trip to Staunton by the employee and his family to inspect the town ; offered help in finding suitable rental housing in Staunton or financial help in building or buying ; and protected employees against loss in the forced sale or relinquishment of their metropolitan homes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one half weeks ' wages for each year of service to those wishing to remain , plus professional help in finding other employment ; and the third gave life pensions to all over sixty-five who stayed in Brooklyn . 46 union was unfortunate in its leadership , for despite the unanimous approval of the contract and our proposal by the rank and tile , their officers flatly refused to sign , Instead they instigated a series of slowdowns which culminated in a sit-in strike by eighty workers that closed the factory and dissipated  --  through interrupted production and a hurried and wasteful move  --  the money that should have gone to our people in pensions and severance pay . " The union , on the contrary , claims that the company at the last minute refused to sign the contract . The majority of A.S.R. 's employees , for personal , professional or amatory reasons , elected to stay in Brooklyn ( population 2,731,000 ; National League ) but 146 of the indispensable supervisory personnel went to Staunton ( 19,927 : Shenandoah Valley League ) as a skilled cadre for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongings and the factory itself was the personal headache of David M. Nason , then assistant director of purchasing , whose previous experience consisted of transferring his family from one house to another . " I felt like Moses , " says Mr. Nason , " without the beard , naturally , and without his flair for mass migrations . but George Bratt told me I was in the wrong book . He said if I wanted vicariousexperience I should skip Exodus and read Mattheir.7 : 7.1 do n't knowwhere he got his Biblical hep  --  from some quiz program no doubt  --  but it was a sound lead . Saint Matthew says , Ask and it shall be given you , so I wrote every firm I could think of that had ever moved and asked how they did it . Every one of them took the trouble to reply , and h gave us a comprehensive blueprint that we followed to the letter . " Letters from the prime movers consulted had agreed on three points . These were that continuing A.S.R. employees , not riggers , oversee removal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its installation in Staunton ; that all equipment leaving Brooklyn be clearly marked with its exact location in the Staunton plant : and that one A.S.R. executive , and only one , be in complete charge during the move and vested with absolute authority over everything and everybody . " I was that omnipotent man , " says Mr. Nason , " and after stifling a wild impulse to send the chairman of the board out for sandwiches , I said a few short prayers and got down to business . We were moving six months sooner than we 'd planned , twice as fast , and doing it under police protection through a picket line in the dead of winter . " The picket line , maintained to the bitter end by a die-hard core of the ousted sit-in strikers , was ineffective , but it had a greater nuisance value than even its leaders realized . " In retrospect , " says Mr. Nason , who was made director of engineering following his able handling of the move , " practically everything that happened seems funny , although I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarms , for example , were damaged during the sit-in and would go off if a mouse cleared his throat . A public-address system was the only communication we had because the intercom system was dismantled and the switchboard operators would n't cross the picket line . It sounded like a Gargantuan bingo game , for the pickets could hear it from outside and we were using numbers rather than names so they would n't know who was working . " Riggers and truckers would cross the picket line to move us only if production stayed at an absolute standstill . Putting finished razors in cartons was considered production , as was removing half-finished blades from the honing machines . We could n't even trot produce . There was a contraption in the basement that mangled rejects to prevent their sale , but if we 'd destroyed a single shaving brush every rigger and trucker would have gone home . They were touchy as boils , but they knew the business better than I did and delivered every piece of equipment at the Staunton plant , about four hundred miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve tractors to make six hundred trips . My worst job had been deciding what not to take . Some machinery was sold because it would n't At into the new production setup , but what about shelving , partitions , hoists , cables , pipes ? What about pencil sharpeners ? Floor mops ? Mouse traps ? The only mice we 've got down here are field mice , and the girls wo n't let us trap them because they 're cute , but that 's when having one man with the authority to say yes or no pays off . Even if he only tosses a coin . As it happened , we did n't leave a thing in Brooklyn we 've needed down here , and I consider it a moving victory for husbands everywhere . My . wife left most of our linen at the laundry and a fellow out in Blade Cartoning tells me his wife forgot the baby carriage . The child was n't in it , of course , but it goes to show . " While Mr. Nason , in Brooklyn , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Staunton telescoping months of work into weeks . " Blades are the tail that wags the dog in the razor business , " says Leo Wise , director of purchasing , " so if your dealers are out of blades you 're practically out of business . It was our job to get the Staunton plant operating while we still had some blades to sell . It was a tough assignment , but I do n't think we lost a single customer , because the first thing we did was borrow a cup of sugar . That 's the way Mr. Weil expressed it . He said the best way to get acquainted in a strange town was to go next door and borrow a cup of sugar . It 's the perfect ice breaker because it gives your neighbor a chance to help you . And we needed help . So we hired Bill Morrison . He was our liaison , our adviser , our expediter , our sponsor , our entree . He was our cup of sugar . " William L. ( Bill ) Morrison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relations , needed all this versatility because the company was in a rush that became more frantic every time someone shaved with an A.S.R. blade . The Staunton factory , basically ideal , had to be greatly enlarged and altered for its new tenants . While this was going on , the machines froM Brooklyn had to be overhauled and painted , a labor force recruited , temporary office and storagespace rented , and housing found for some 300 strangers in a town where scarcely fifty rental properties were on the market . " Actually , " says Mr. Morrison , " it was n't so bad as it sounds , for we 've got excellent hotels here , and motels , and the company had already made arrangements for its people to acquire their own homes . All we had to do was expedite these plans without going off half cocked , and the most tempting way to go off half cocked was rejected by Mr. Weil the minute it was suggested . This was to buy several hundred acres near the plant and build an A.S.R. community . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want an A.S.R. community . We wanted them in this community , right up to their ears . " Nir . Morrison deplores intimations that he had to act as intermediary , even referee , in this fusion . " All I did , " he claims , " was tell our people they were n't moving from Brooklyn , New York , to Staunton , Virginia . They were moving from a large city toa small town  --  it could have been Rome , Georgia , or Fargo , North Dakota  --  and they 'd have to accept different customs and different ways . A few would n't , and another few simply could n't . They wanted to be friendly , but they suffered from a complete breakdown in communication . They did n't realize , for instance , that in a small town the old inhabitant makes one call on a new neighbor and then waits for it to be returned . A second call , without any response to the first , would be pushing , ' but some of our people did n't observe this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooed . When they were n't , they complained that after one ' snooping visit ' the neighbors dropped them as though they had leprosy , Or a new friend would invite them to Come over and see us sometime . ' In New York this means absolutely nothing  --  like ' Let 's have lunch together someday , ' without setting a definite day  --  but down here it means exactly what it says . It means Come over and see us sometime . Anytime . Bring the children . ' Our people did n't understand this , either , so they stayed home twiddling their thumbs.Then they 'd get lonely and gravitate into an A.S.R. clique , and that was the end . That 's happened with five or six families , but the rest have become more Virginian than the governor  --  and of forty-one who came down intending to stay , and then went back to New ' York , the vast majority left here with regret on both sides . Some returned for family reasons and some could n't stand the quiet . But some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant have stayed on , and Tommy Sheehan ' , vent back to Brooklyn on a visit and found he did n't like it any more . " Mr. Sheehan , who is manufacturing administrator , denies he disliked Brooklyn on second sight , but admits he prefers Staunton . " It took me quite a while to find out , " he says , " and my wife longer , but from now on we 're strictly Confederate . Brooklyn died hard with me because it 's full of my relatives . That and the cold . I drove down here with two other fellows in a December snowstorm and all the way down we kept figuring that it would suddenly , somehow , turn warm and nice as soon as we crossed the Mason and Dixon line . Instead it snowed harder , and when Bill Smith stepped out of the car in Staunton , he fell on the ice and broke three ribs . On the ice , mind you , in the sunny South . And I was lonely . I 'd left my family in Brooklyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got under control at the plant and I went home on a visit and  --  bang ! ? the bloom went off Brooklyn . Suddenly the whole place seemed like the New Lots Avenue express . Everybody was pushing and shoving to get nowhere faster , and when they asked how you were , they did n't give a damn . Down here they really want to know . I came right back and rented a house . " Mrs. Sheehan did n't like Staunton at first . No friends . No crowds . She loves crowds , and you could pack all of Staunton into Ebbets Field and still have room for Ladies ' Day . Then she decided Virginians were just like the Irish , and she 's been happy as a lark ever since . What decided her was the landlord refusing to redecorate while his regular painter was in jail , because he 'd need the work when he got out . Six months . D. and D. Now she 's more native than Pocahontas and feeds me fried apples for breakfast . Next it 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like hominy grits because it looks like cereal , but they 're nuts about hominy because it looks like popcorn . The little girl is also nuts about military academies . There are two of them in this section and she spends most of her time looking at cadets . Drooling . She 's ten . After renting for a year , we built our own house . Mrs. Sheehan wanted a split level like they have on Long Island , but the contractor talked her out of it . Said his wife did n't like them . His wife , mind you , not mine . So they compromised . He built a ranch-type house ( Continued front Page 46 ) and my wife made him drop the living room . Now everybody 's happy , but some of our people were arguing with their contractors right down to the wire . " The " wire " was the December 31 , 1956 , time limit set by the company on its offer to finance new homes . The offer guaranteed financing up to two and one half times the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up to one quarter of a year 's salary , for household appliances and automobiles . Cars are necessary to reach the plant , three miles from Staunton , so this last part has had a bigger play than the first , but sixty-six of the 108 remaining families have built or purchased homes and the great majority were financed entirely by the company . Prices , sometimes higher than in Brooklyn , have been almost the sole area of discord . " New Yorkers are discount happy , " one merchant complains sadly , " spoiled by the ' 1 can get it for you wholesale ' school of merchandising and by the discount houses . But discount houses require big-city volume and they do n't give service or credit . " Staunton merchants extend credit to practically anyone wearing shoes , and with an airy disregard for time that astounds some of the newcomers and shocks others . " In New York , " says Richard Good-now , credit manager for A.S.R. , " the doctor would n't even put me on the operating table until I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plead with my doctor to send me one . Same way with furniture . I walked in the store a total stranger , and the owner put everything on the cuff . I did n't ask him to , he just did it , and I almost had to subpoena him to get a bill . Janet Parkinson , one of our voucher girls , ran into the same thing with the vet . He treated her beagle for distemper , and when it died anyway , he would n't send a bill until he 'd found her another . Now she 's got a pair of them and he still has n't sent it . Probably waiting until she can start a pack , but how 's Janet going to keep her books ? " Mr , Morrison , whose ownership of a grocery store and a stock farm makes him an authority on Valley cuffing practices , has a simple explanation for this fiscal laissez faire . " Staunton merchants and professional men are n't patsies , " he says . " They go on friendship and personal integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning is a tribute to our Brooklyn people and the company 's spadework . Mr. Goodnow was n't a stranger when he walked into Wall 's Colonial House to buy furniture , and Mrs. Parkinson was n't a stranger to her vet  --  they were both old friends with established credit . A.S.R. introduced them in absentia . " The company 's spadework was done before , during , and after the move . Employees in Brooklyn , in addition to free trips to Staunton , were provided with illustrated brochures that described the town in detail  --  its schools , churches , hospitals , stores , government , industries , people , history , habits , customs and crotchets . This information was supplemented by specially prepared documentary films of Staunton and the Shenandoah Valley and by personal conferences with company officials . In Staunton these same officials spoke to service clubs , educators , ministers , businessmen and passers-by , explaining the firm 's plans , prospects , policies and personnel . They scuttled rumors  --  one , that A.S.R. was importing 400 Puerto Ricans , probably in chains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and they allayed fears that all Brooklynites carried knives , supported themselves by mugging , and kept a marijuana cigarette dangling from one side of their mouths while they mangled the king 's English from the other . The move , completed in early January of 1955 , has had important dollar benefits for Staunton and Augusta County . From a projection of figures compiled by the Norfolk and Western Railroad , which conies right into the plant via its Chesapeake Western subsidiary , the company and its 900 employees bring over $3,000,000 a year to Augusta County in additional retail sales , over 54,000,000 in bank deposits , and over 56,000,000 in capital investment . Such an influx of goods , people and money could not fail to have an impact on a county whose population is less than 40,000 , but it is still those immigrants from Brooklyn who have made the deepest impression . " Before those people came here , " says an elderly lady who prefers to remain anonymous , " my only interest in razors was that a lot of Republicans would cut their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but I will not eat salami . " Such regional dietary foibles , along with the proper pronunciation of Staunton ( the " 17 ' is silent ) , were among the early sources of discord that have all but disappeared . Roe herring , Sally Lunns , hominy grits , okra , turnip greens and corn bread , once thought lethal , now grace the Brooklyn boards . Small Fry have taken to addressing their startled elders as " sir " and " ma'am . " These same elders . alter preliminary wails that " You ca n't buy a drink ; you have to buy a drunk , " have become inured to the absence of bars and have discovered that buying liquor by the bottle at state package stores has a pleasant effect on the domestic economy . The Virginia poll tax has found few champions , but the state 's pay-as-you-go policy and practically nonexistent public debt have endeared it to employees almost as much as to the company . " The only unfavorable comparison I could possibly make between Staunton and New York , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that Staunton is smaller , and I had to rack my brains to think of that . It lacks a lot of the things that make New York New York  --  and so do Paris and Chicago  --  but name me an industrial-relations man in New York who can play golf during his lunch hour , or shoot a bear , or even go home . That 's the best part . Down here our people are at work ten minutes after they leave home and they 're fresh as cucumbers . They have n't spent an hour on the subway , and they do n't spend the day dreading the trip back . " Mr. Wigfield has n't shot any bears yet , but some of his colleagues have , and one of them , to his wife 's continuing terror , bagged a wildcat . Most of the others content themselves with the less fearsome game abounding in the nearby Blue Ridge and Allegheny Mountains or have taken to exploring the mammoth caves that are almost as plentiful . " We 've already got a lot of speleoiogists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of research and development , " and the place is crawling with amateur historians who follow Stonewall Jackson up and down the valley like sutlers . One fellow put over twenty thousand miles on his car without even crossing the mountains , studying places he 'd read about in school . In moving to Virginia , A.S.R. was actually coming home , for it was incorporated there in its present form in 1919 , but few of its employees had ever seen the old homestead . ' ' We organized here because Virginia corporate law was hospitable , " says Mr. Wise , " and I 'm glad we 've finally joined up with our charter . Living in a small town has enriched all of us . I only hope we 've done something to enrich the town . " The general consensus among natives is that they have . Brooklyn employees have entered into civic , religious , educational and social affairs almost to a man , and their contribution to the public welfare has been out of all proportion to their number . The Jewish and Roman Catholic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestant churches  --  have both been immeasurably strengthened and the B.P.O.E. , long dying of malnutrition , has been completely revived . 1 t is as an Elk that Calvin Depew , manager of operations , takes over a Staunton boy 's paper route one morning each year , and as a member of Trinity Episcopal Church that he loses his pants to the rummage sales . " We 've joined everything that will take us in , " he says , " and that means practically everything except the United Daughters of the Confederacy . They 'd probably take us in , too , if it were n't for their bylaws . Friendliest people I ever saw . " Once they discovered it was n't curiosity , this small-town friendliness captured most of the Brooklyn employees  --  especially John Rogers , chief inspector of quality control . " It 's been fantastic , " says Mr. Rogers , a transplanted former British naval officer , " the friendship and the fun we 've found . Our smallest boy , going on four , was hit by a taxi soon after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During that time he received a hundred and twenty-three presents front total strangers . And a lot of other total strangers , including the taxi driver , would spend their afternoons reading to him , The visiting hours made it hard for Mrs , Rogers to see to dinner , but every night when we returned from the hospital , it would he on the table waiting for us . Sometimes two or three dinners . Neighbors , We 'll never forget it . " Others have had less memorable introductions to small-town kindness , but all attribute it to some peculiar alchemy of Virginia and the South . Mr. Morrison has attempted to combat this pleasing canard with statements that geography is immaterial and people the same everywhere , but so far with a gratifying lack of success . His most satisfying failure occurred with Mrs. Gloria Raymond , a Canadian secretary he was helping prepare for her citizenship examination . For weeks her reading of American history had seemed more dutiful than enthralled , and Mr , Morrison was beginning to fear she 'd revert to the Queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapt attention . " The Civil War , " she explained almost breathlessly . " It 's fascinating . " " Alt , yes , " said Mr. Morrison . " The War Between the States . A deplorable tragedy that " Mrs. Raymond stopped him in mid-sentence . " Do n't you dare tell me how it turns out , " she said , " because if the South loses , I 'm going to sit right down and cry , "
