For amateur atom fans , a group of scientists at Brookhaven National Laboratory offered last week a " continuous cloud chamber . " Based on a ten-year-old but neglected idea , it is simple enough , say the Brookhaven men , to be built and operated by the teacher of a high-school science class . <P> The standard Wilson cloud chamber for making atomic particles visible is a rather complicated apparatus . It contains moist air and a movable diaphragm or piston to rarefy it suddenly . This action cools the air by expansion and makes it " supersaturated " with water vapor which will condense into water droplets if given proper nuclei to condense upon . Fast-moving atomic particles provide the nuclei by ionizing ( electrifying ) the normally neutral atoms of the air . So particles ( e.g. , cosmic rays from outer space ) that pass through the cloud chamber become visible as thin white trails of water droplets . <P> The trouble with such complicated chambers is that they operate only for a brief period after the air has been rarefied . Brookhaven 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plate standing on a layer of dry ice and covered with black velvet for better visibility . On top of the plate sits an open-ended glass cylinder anywhere from 5 to 17 inches in diameter . A second metal plate with a layer of felt cemented to its under side is placed on the cylinder . On top of the whole apparatus is a tray of water at room temperature . <P> To put the chamber in operation , the felt under its cover is saturated with methyl ( wood ) alcohol . The alcohol vapor diffuses downward , becoming colder as it approaches the dry ice at the bottom . At some point in its downward motion it makes the air supersaturated . In this sensitive layer , cosmic rays or other fast-moving atomic particles leave trails that show up in a flashlight beam as brilliant white streaks .
