INDIRECTION The best way to keep a secret is to publish it in a quite unbelievable form  --  and insist that it is the truth . BY EVERETT B. COLE Illustrated by Freas Elwar Forell leaned back in his chair , looking about the small dining salon . The usual couples were there , he noticed . Of course , the faces were different from those of last evening , but the poses were similar . And the people were there for the same reasons . They were enjoying the food and drinks , just as many others had enjoyed them before . But like all those others , their greater enjoyment was in the company of one another . Forell glanced at the vacant chair across the table from him and sighed . It would be nice , he thought , if  --  But any arrangement involving a permanent companion would be hardly practical under his circumstances . After all , prudence dictated limits . He picked up his cup and drained it , then leaned back and beckoned the waiter over . " The reckoning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter on the table before him , then folded it and put it in his pocket . It was well , he thought . His latest book of fairy tales and fantasy had enjoyed good acceptance . And the check in the letter had been of satisfactory size . He smiled to himself . There were compensations in this job of his . It seemed to be profitable to have a purpose other than the obvious and usual one . He paid his bill and left the restaurant , to walk slowly along the street , enjoying the mild , spring air . As he passed a sidewalk cafe , a man beckoned from one of the tables . " Oh , Forell , " he called . " I was hoping I 'd see you this evening . " He held up a book . " Just finished your ' Tales of the Sorcerers , ' " he added . " Some of those yarns of yours seem almost real . " Elwar Forell nodded . They should , he thought . Factual material , however disguised , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexhaustible source of material , drawn from many sources . He twisted his face into a gratified smile . " That 's my objective , " he said aloud . " I do all in my power to place the reader inside the story . " Charo Andorra nodded . " It 's the secret of good fiction , I know , " he admitted , " and every storyteller tries to do it . But I seem to see more than that in your stuff . There 's an almost believable pattern . " He hesitated . " You know , while I 'm reading it , I can almost see beings of superior powers walking the earth . And sometimes , I visualize us working with them . " He laughed shortly . " Of course , I may be more credulous and imaginative than most . Probably why I 'm a critic . And I really should know better . " He looked down at the book in his hands . " But that stuff of yours can be mighty convincing . " He tilted his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the old legends  --  and some of the things that have happened in more recent years , too . Ca n't help but wonder if we actually are babes of the cosmos , and if we have n't been visited and watched by some form of extra-planetary life at one time or another . " Forell looked closely at his friend . Andorra , he knew , was a clear thinker in his own right . And he just might start a serious analysis  --  and publish it . He grimaced . It was n't time for that , he knew . Many years must pass before it would be time . He placed a hand on the back of Andorra 's chair , remembering the words of one of the teachers . " Remember , Elwar , " he had been told , " your objective is clear , but your methods must be most indirect  --  even unclear . Some things you must obscure in a mass of obviously imaginative detail , while you bring others to the fore . You must hint . You must suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must never be guilty of definite , direct falsehood . " There may come a time when you will be directly questioned  --  when discovery of your real background and purpose seems imminent , and you will have to take positive action . For such an eventuality , I can not outline any steps , or even any definite plan of action , since I neither fully understand many of the factors involved , nor have any way of knowing the circumstances which may arise . You 'll have to prepare yourself for almost anything , always keeping in mind the peculiarities and capabilities of your own people . " It looked as though the time might have come . If Andorra , a clever , influential critic , should guess at the real background and the sources of the Forell tales , and if he should misunderstand the motives behind those tales , he would probably publish his thoughts . And those thoughts would be widely read . Many would smile as they read and regard the thing as a hoax . But others might start their own analyses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusions and cause undesirable , even disastrous , reactions . It would be many generations before clear explanations could be made and definite principles outlined without causing misunderstanding and serious damage . The Forell tales were evasive and preparatory as well as vaguely instructive . Illustration He recovered his self-discipline and waved his hand negligently . " You know , Charo , " he said laughingly , " I 've been thinking along similar lines for a long while . Of course , you know I must have built up some sort of fantasy world to base my yarns on ? " Andorra nodded . " That 's obvious . I 've been wondering about some of your basic theory . Like to see your notes some time . " Forell spread his hands . " You 're quite welcome to look them over , " he said . " Come on up to my rooms now . " He smiled . " As a matter of fact , I 've been doing a little extension on my dream world . Built up a little sketch a while ago , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " * * * * * As they entered the study , Forell walked across to his desk . He fumbled for a few seconds under the desk , then opened a drawer . For a moment , he paused , looking inside , then pulled out a thin folder . Again , he hesitated . At last , he picked a small , metallic object from the drawer and held it in his left hand . " Might need this , " he told himself . " If I 'm wrong , it 'll take a sector patrolman to straighten out the mess . And I could be wrong  --  two ways . " Casually , he placed his left hand in his pocket , then he turned toward Andorra , holding out the folder . " Here , " he said . " See what you think of this one . " Andorra opened the folder , taking out a few sheets of paper . He read for a moment , then looked up quizzically . " A little different from your usual style , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm trying something new , " he said . " Go ahead and read it , then tell me what you think . " He busied himself with a bottle and glasses . * * * * * INFORMAL MEMO 130-263 From : Explorations Officer , Sector Nine To : Ecological Officer Subject : Incident Report Enclosed is the file on that recent occurrence on Planet 3-G3-9/4871 , consisting of the certificates and statements of the various officers and guardsmen concerned , together with a digest of the interrogation of Elwar Forell , a young planetary native , who appears to have been the instigator . It seems to me that something is seriously wrong with our system of operation , at least on the subject planet . After all , our operations have the purpose of research and observation , with a view to protection and development . Certainly , we can not create chaos . And knowledge of our existence by very young cultures would certainly cause just that . We 've got to clear this up in a hurry . The Elder Galactics are most certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like to make them unhappy . Obviously , there was a chain of errors , and some of our people concerned will have to be reassigned for further training , but that 's just the beginning . I 've recalled all the observers from this planet , pending reorganization , and we 've got to come up with an answer that 'll prevent further occurrences of this nature , as well as covering this affair on the planet concerned . I realize that the situation has some of the elements of comedy , and I presume that it will eventually be regarded with considerable amusement , but right at the moment , my sense of humor is working very poorly . I have a few ideas of my own , but would like to have your recommendations and those of other section officers before I make any final decision or report . I am calling a conference on this incident at 280.1000 , so make a full investigation on this , and give me some practical recommendation as soon as possible . CIJORN 6 enclosures STATEMENT I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exploratory Section , Sector Nine . At 261.0196 , I was on duty in the emergency communications room at Increment Four . A call came in from Resident Station number fourteen , Planet 3-G3-9/4871 , requesting emergency condensation over the immediate station area . Co-ordinates were not given and I checked the planetary co-ordinates with the call sign and the Communications List . I added these to the message and forwarded the request to the Patrol Duty Officer for his action . There was no visual on the call , but the voice sounded urgent . I relayed the request without requiring special authentication , since the station was precisely on the correct settings , no inimical culture is known to be operating in this sector , and the coded call was correct . At the time , I had no way of suspecting that this was not a genuine emergency call . Florand Anremdor Comm. 1/c CERTIFICATE I , Captain Binkar Morancos , am assigned to the 334th Vector , which is presently under the orders of the Commander , Sector Nine . I was assigned as Sector Patrol Duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Increment Four , requesting emergency condensation on a planet in that increment . I checked the co-ordinates and data furnished , consulted the situation chart , and instructed Cruiser P-4730 , Captain Klorantel commanding , to carry out the mission . Since the message came through normal channels , I had no doubt as to its authenticity , and treated it as routine . I felt that the cruiser commander could deal with the matter at his discretion . Binkar Morancos Capt . StG(C) CERTIFICATE I , Captain Corrondao Klorantel , am in command of the Stellar Guard Cruiser Myloren , number P-4730 . I am assigned to duty with the 334th Vector , which is operating in Sector Nine . The Myloren was on routine patrol in the Fourth Increment at 261.0203 , when a message was received from Sector Headquarters , giving co-ordinates on Planet 3-G3-9/4871 , with a request for emergency condensation . I proceeded to the subject planet and took position outside the atmosphere . Visual checks failed to show any emergency condition on the surface , though a burned-out area was noted in the forest a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A call was made to the resident station , requesting clarification of the request , and the answer proved to be unsatisfactory . There was no visual transmission , and the voice was strongly accented . The message gave insufficient data for action , contained no identification , and was in improper form for station-to-ship contact . I decided to make contact by other means , and shifted my secondary communicator to the guardsman 's personal settings , requesting further information , suitable identification , and confirmation of the request . Guardsman Jaeger immediately informed me that the call was spurious , stating that he was away from his station , and that he would return immediately . During the conversation , I noted that full condensation was taking place to atmospheric limits . I called Auxiliary , and Technician Melran stated that his control circuits were inoperative and that he was tracing the difficulty . He cleared the trouble , but condensation had already been established and precipitation had commenced . I ordered re-absorption , which was started as soon as repairs had been accomplished . At the request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if necessary , maintaining contact with his station . At 0572 , Jaeger requested immediate evacuation for himself and for one other person . I entered atmosphere , made planetfall with nullified visibility , and took off the guardsman and a young native . During the evacuation , I noted a number of natives armed with various implements , who were attempting to break their way into the station . Guardsman Jaeger fired his demolitions as he left , firing the screen generator with his last flare . For a few minutes , the natives fell back before the flames , but they were entering the station by the time we cleared the planet . It is believed that the installation was completely destroyed .

At 261.0204 , I was on duty in Auxiliary Equipment when Captain Klorantel called , informing me that a request had come in for emergency condensation . He told me to set up and await execution order . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a three kilometer radius at surface . I then put the controls on automatic trigger , notified the captain , and went on with my normal duties . At 0221 , we came out of trans-light , and I adjusted my equipment for slow-drive operation . At 0223 , my indicators showed activity on the forward radiators . I checked and discovered that full power was being applied . Attempts to override the automatics were unsuccessful , and while I was attempting to clear the trouble , the captain called again , saying that the request was false , and asking why I had turned the radiators on . I told him that the controls were jammed , and he instructed me to make repairs and set up re-absorption . I discovered a short between the automatic trigger and the ship 's secondary communication antenna . After clearing this , I found trouble in the control section of the condensation driver . The automatic trigger had become fused , and the control paths were shorted to full-drive throughout . The sub-assemblies were replaced and trouble cleared by 0300 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eq Tech 3/c STATEMENT I , Franz Jaeger , am Resident Guardsman at Station Fourteen , Planet 3-G3-9/4871 . I have been assigned to my station for eight planetary years for survey and observation duty . During the past five years , I have employed Elwar Forell , the son of a local peasant , to keep the living quarters clean and to do general work about the station . I have never discussed the possibilities of extra-planetary civilization with him , and I have been careful to exclude him from knowledge of my technical equipment , which I have kept in a secure room in accordance with regulations . I have presented myself to him , as well as to all the villagers in my area , as a scholar , tired of city life , and desirous of a quiet existence . There has been a drought in part of my area for the entire season . We have suffered from one forest fire and there is a strong possibility of others . Crops are doing very badly , and the peasants have been complaining bitterly . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discomfort and worry , since there is a very definite threat of famine . There have been numerous attempts to obtain rain by occult means , and I have been personally approached on the matter . For some time , the villagers in the immediate area of the station have regarded me as a sorcerer , and I have been asked to cast a spell to cause rain . I had considered a request for light condensation , but had hesitated to make such a request , since I felt that rain closely following the villagers ' petition to me would confirm their supernatural beliefs , which I have attempted to discourage . At 261.0223 , I was on a routine tour of my area . I received a call from the cruiser Myloren , Captain Klorantel commanding , asking for further information on a request for emergency condensation . I informed him that I had made no such request , adding that a light rain would be desirable if he were in position and prepared to radiate . During the conversation with Captain Klorantel , I noted that the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I felt the signs of imminent , heavy rain . I promptly started back to my station . Upon my arrival , I discovered that Elwar had managed to open the communications room and had been using the equipment . He was extremely frightened , and made incoherent remarks about talking to a demon . When I attempted to question him as to how he had opened the room , and where he had learned the operation of the communications equipment , he became hysterical and I could find out precisely nothing . By this time , it was raining violently . There was a high wind . Several trees had been blown down and lightning was frequent . A flood was starting down the mountainside toward the village , threatening severe damage . It was quite apparent that crops , such as they were , would be almost completely destroyed . At the time , I could do little to remedy the situation . I re-established contact with the cruiser , informed Captain Klorantel of the situation , and requested that he stand by . I then turned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications room . Since Elwar had been in the room on several previous occasions , I saw no reason for excluding him . On the contrary , I thought it would be advisable to keep him with me , since I felt that he would be seriously injured if he were turned loose in the village . I do not believe he would have survived the fury of the villagers , who had taken shelter , and were watching the destruction of their crops . The flood had become a torrent , which overflowed the banks of the village brook , tore at the bridge , and swept through the lanes . In the fields , grain was beaten into the ground and it was clear that the villagers would have little or no harvest to celebrate during the approaching festival . The wind grew in force , lashing at the tall festival pole , which bent , crashed down in the village square , and partially demolished the front of the inn . During this period , there was no human activity , since everyone had taken what shelter he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind died down , and people started gathering in the square . For a time , they milled about , wading through the ebbing flood . They examined the damage , then they gathered in groups , talking earnestly . The dry wind came up at 0510 , and by 0550 , the entire village was on the march toward my station . Their intentions were quite easy to determine . They were armed with pitchforks , scythes , axes , and other tools which could be converted to offensive use . I established a protective screen , but realized that to set up a permanent defense would be impractical and even harmful . I therefore called the cruiser , requesting evacuation for myself and for young Forell . Prior to evacuation , I demolished all my fixed equipment , so that the only things left for the villagers to find when they entered the station were damaged remains of those things normal for a recluse scholar of their era . Franz Jaeger Observer 2/c INFORMAL MEMO 130-265 From : Evaluations Officer To : Explorations Officer Subject : Interrogation Enclosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forell , who was evacuated from forty-eight seventy-one , in company with Guardsman Jaeger . This boy was abjectly terrified and had to be calmed several times during questioning . He was pitiably hysterical when recalling his conversation with Captain Klorantel , who , you will remember , is a capriform humanoid . The subject appears to be an intelligent specimen of his race , and when he had conquered his hysteria , was extremely co-operative , showing active interest in his surroundings . I believe he would be able to assimilate training , and would make a valuable addition to the Stellar Guard . I recommend his retention and training . If Elwar is a typical " son of a simple peasant , " and if the planet from which he comes has any considerable number of " simple peasants " with sons like him , I can foresee some strangely interesting problems in connection with further dealings on that planet . FONZEC 1 enclosure DIGEST Interrogation of Elwar Forell , native of Planet 3-G3-9/4871 . " My Masters , I did mean no harm , but only good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power denied to most men . When I was apprenticed to him five years ago , I thought I would one day learn some of the dark secrets of the hidden worlds , but never did my master mention aught of those secrets he so surely knew . He taught me only of those things known to the scholars . He told me of reading , of writing , and of ciphering , and taught me many facts of our world which are known to the learned . I wished to know of many other things , but of these he was silent . Even so , I am grateful for his teachings , for how else could the son of a simple peasant gain the knowledge of the scholars ? " I saw that my master often repaired to a room which I was never allowed to enter . This room he cleaned himself . And he always entered in the greatest of secrecy , being quite cross with me when I once betrayed curiosity . I remained curious , however , and fell at last to watching him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside a secret panel , then turned a wheel this way and that , finally pushing a handle . I watched , at last learning to what numbers he did turn the wheel , and how he pushed the handle . During his absences , I went sometimes to that room of magic , and I read the books of power , though there was much I could not read , since much of the writing was in strange tongues and I dared not ask my master the meanings of the strange words . But for his own convenience , my master had written many instructions plainly . And these , I read . " I did learn that there were powers beyond those of men . I learned that these strange instruments on the table did have strange ability to call forth demons and spirits , but never until that day did I dare touch other than the books and papers . And those I took great care to restore to their original condition . " For three months past , my father 's land and the fields of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been no rain , nor hint of rain , and the peasants have cried out for relief . They have appealed even to my master , who has told them that he has no strange powers  --  that he can do naught to call up rain . But they did not believe him , nor did I , Elwar , who knew better than this . I had seen the books of power , and I knew the demons could cause the skies to deliver water if rightly asked . So , I visited the room of magic upon the occasions of my master 's absence . And I tried to decipher his writings that I might find the means to ask for the skies to open . Always , when I felt my master 's presence approaching , I left the room , taking care to properly lock the door and to hide all evidence of my entry . " On that day of direful events , I found a paper in my master 's hand . It mentioned fire in the forests . It mentioned rain . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time , I practiced the strange syllables . Many times did I speak them aloud , then I pressed the bosses on the table , as shown by one of the books . There was a light . Then , the great ball glowed with color , to show me the first demon . " He spoke . And I conquered my fear , to repeat the syllables I had labored to learn . Once again , he spoke , and I could not understand him . I could think of nothing but to say again those words which I hoped would bring the rain we so badly needed . I took my hands from the bosses and stood , wondering what would happen . The ball became dark . " I stood , waiting . And nothing happened . Finally , thinking nothing was to occur , I turned and started to leave the room . Then , a great voice spoke . Again , the wall was alight . Within it was a fearsome demon who glared at me ferociously and demanded something in that tongue of power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearfully . And he spoke again . Then did I repeat again the words I had learned , and ran from the room . " It became dark . The lightnings flashed , and the rain fell , and my master came , but not as I had ever seen him before . He did not walk from the forest as was his wont , but appeared before me from the air . I started back in fright , for now I was certain beyond doubt that he was a man of great wizardry . I thought he would beat me , or possibly cast me under a spell . " Never has he beaten me , always saying that it was wrong to beat an apprentice , and that those who so did were lacking in their senses . And this is but another proof of his sorcery , for who , other than a sorcerer , could handle his servants without beating them ? " I dared do nothing other than to tell him of my misdoing , and he rushed to the room , taking me with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not known of , and the demon appeared again and talked with him . Then , my master made strange passes about the instruments and the village was shown in the ball . " At last the rain stopped . A wind blew  --  hot and dry , as from the pit  --  and the people came and did try by violence to enter . But they could not . At last , the great machine came , and though we could not at first see it , we entered and were carried away through the sky . " The people watched the house burn , then entered , to scatter the ashes . " And I am here , and afraid . " * * * Doer Kweiros flipped off the playback and gazed at the unresponsive wall . He rubbed the back of his head , looked at the viewsphere , then checked the playback index and tapped the rewind . " Oh , me , " he complained sorrowfully , " how do we get into these things ? " He looked toward the communicator controls unhappily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere lit and an alert face looked at him inquiringly . " How is that Forell boy ? " " Soaking up information like a sponge , sir . " Kweiros nodded . " Gathered he might , " he remarked . " Send him up here , will you ? And have Jaeger come with him . " " Yes , sir . " Kweiros snapped the communicator off , sat back to drum idly on his desk , then got up and walked over to his master file control board . He glanced at the index , then punched out a sequence on the buttons . There was a subdued hum and a door opened . Kweiros reached into the compartment , to take out several tape reels . He glanced at them , nodded , and went back to the desk , where he spread them out and looked from one to another . Finally , he selected one of the smaller reels and started to thread it into the playback . There was a light tap on the door and he looked up . " So soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered and stood at attention . Beside him was a boy , who looked curiously and a little fearfully at the officer , who waved to chairs . " Sit down , both of you . I 'm not going to claw you . Just want to go over a few things . I 've some ideas , but I want to be sure of a couple of points . " The captain glanced at the reels before him . " One thing puzzles me , Jaeger . Why did you have notes in the planetary language in your communications room ? " Jaeger stirred uneasily . " I started doing that some time ago , sir , " he explained . " You see , their language is quite dissimilar to either my own or to Galactica , and I have yet to learn to think in it . I wanted to avoid any possibility of lapsing away from it , so I translated my instructions and notes , hoping to keep myself constantly reminded to refrain from using Galactica at any time . " He spread his hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I presume , " he admitted . " Anyway , that 's done , and we ca n't do much about it now . Now for another thing . " He glanced at the tape reels . " I noticed that the villagers in your area regarded you as a sorcerer . What cause did they have to form such an opinion ? " " None , sir , that I know of . " Jaeger shook his head . Kweiros looked at the boy . " Elwar ? " " Why , all the village knew it , Master . " The boy shook his head . " One had but to be near Master Jaeger for a time , and he could feel the power , just as I can feel it now . " He shook his head again . " But it is very strong , Master . You must be one of the ones of truly great power . " Kweiros looked speculatively at Jaeger . " I understood they were nontelepaths . All the reports agree on that . " " Definitely , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trace of radiation , even when they 're close . And they do n't receive . You can try it now , sir . It 's just like punching into space itself . No resistance , no reflection , just nothing . " " Shield ? " " No , sir . Just no indication . Makes me feel as though I were in free space with a dead drive . " * * * Kweiros looked for a moment at Jaeger , then sent out a probing thought , searching for some indication of mental activity from the boy . But there was nothing . It was n't anything like a shield , he thought . It seemed more like an infinite baffle . But there was some reaction . The boy shrank back in terror . " Please , Master , " he begged . " Do not place me under enchantment . " He held up his hands in a peculiar gesture . " What made you do that ? " Kweiros raised a hand slowly , palm out . " I have no intention of harming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to cast me under a spell . " " You ... felt me ? " " To be sure , Master , just as I have felt the same power from my master , Jaeger . But this was far stronger . It hurt . And it seemed as though you wanted me to do something . " Kweiros nodded . " I think I 'm getting an idea , " he remarked . " And it scares me a little . They 're not really nontelepathic , any more than the Kierawelans , for example , are nonvocal . I think we 've got something here that 's almost unique in the galaxy . " He rubbed his neck . " Excuse me a few minutes . I want to check something in one of these tapes . " Jaeger nodded and leaned back in his chair , looking curiously at the boy beside him , then back at his superior , who had selected a tape reel . He threaded it into the playing heads , put on a headband , and snapped a switch . Jaeger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face became vacant , then twisted , seeming to reflect painful mental effort . Slowly , he leaned forward again , touching another switch . Then , he sank back , to concentrate on his thoughts . Jaeger looked again at the boy , who was sitting tensely , his hands gripping the arms of his chair , his eyes fastened fearfully on the officer before him . As Jaeger watched , Elwar half rose from his chair , then sank back , his face appearing to mirror Kweiros ' efforts . Illustration At last , Kweiros sat up . Shakily , he removed his headband and snapped the playback off . " Long time since I checked that tape , " he said . " Pretty rugged stuff , and highly speculative . Always gives me a headache . " He shook his head as he looked at Elwar . " And this makes it even worse . It was bad enough as pure speculation , but we 've got something real here . Something rough . For one thing , we have got a planet where no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another we  --  " He cupped his chin in his hands and examined Elwar closely . " Do you really want to learn the secrets you looked for in the books , youngster ? Do you still want the secrets you first thought you might learn ? " The boy seemed to withdraw a little . " I have a great fear , " he admitted tremulously . " You have n't been injured or mistreated , have you ? " " No , Master , but  --  " Elwar looked toward the door . " And you wo n't be , " he was told reassuringly . " Now you just go ahead on back to your quarters . " * * * As the door closed , Kweiros turned to Jaeger . " Think we 'll put you on special assignment . For the next few cycles , you 'll act as a private tutor . Then you can go back to Main Base with Elwar while they give him his training . " Jaeger raised his eyebrows . " Yes , sir , " he said doubtfully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . " I 'm quite sure of it , " he said . " And he 's got a big job ahead of him . He may be instrumental in preventing a major disaster . " He waved at the tape reels . " I got that little tape out just on an off chance , " he added . " Did n't really expect to find anything , but  --  " He flipped his hands out . " Anyway , I pulled it . " He leaned forward , looking at Jaeger . " We may have run into a second , or even third growth culture , " he said slowly . " Once , before some ancient war of destruction , the people of this planet might have been normally telepathic . " He closed his eyes for an instant . " Possibly they were unable to use their telepathic power . And equally possibly , they could have had a highly developed mechanical civilization . Something went wrong . " He waved at the tape reel . " In this reconstruction , there 's an hypothesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaches high development and wrecks itself  --  leaving no trace of its accomplishments . Growth starts over from the most meager of beginnings . Survival becomes a matter of the most bitter conflict , with everyone becoming a hunter and being hunted in his turn . In this situation , detection of an enemy becomes vital . " He grinned wryly . " Can you imagine what would happen to someone who radiated his thoughts ? " Jaeger ran a finger over his lips . " He 'd be easy to locate , " he mused . " And he 'd have a hard time evading an enemy . " " Precisely . " Kweiros nodded . " And he 'd never be able to approach his prey . In short , he 'd fail to survive . Complete telepathic blankness would have a high survival value . But an ability to detect mental radiation would still be a big help . " He waved a hand . " So , a race like this one could evolve . And the author of this tape extrapolated from there . A normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A completely black body , however , will neither radiate nor feed back . It merely absorbs energy and , unless it 's super-imposed on a reflective background , it leaves no trace . Since nothing in nature other than a telepathic mind can reflect telepathy , no background would survive for long . " He frowned a little . " Of course , no mind we are familiar with could act as a telepathically black body , but this author hypothesized a race that could do just that  --  plus . There 's a further hypothesis of an ability to detect and localize radiations as such , without bothering to resolve them . " " Sounds like just what we have here , " Jaeger admitted . " It does , does n't it ? " Kweiros nodded . " And there 's a further extrapolation . Some of the members or the elder races have speculated on a sort of second-order telepathy , undetectable to the normal telepath , but capable of noting normal radiation . And some of the speculations seem to make sense  --  though they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specific sense , it 's difficult to visualize it , or even to speculate on its presence . " He drew a deep breath . " That leads us into a real problem . Our people roamed around this planet for several cycles this time . And there may have been others before us , who did n't record their visits , other than in the minds and legends of the natives . And there may be other legends from that other , older culture . " He shrugged . " We picked up what we could on the culture , but we did n't get the full story on them . And we 've probably left a thousand legends behind us , including that beautiful mess at your station . " He grinned . " Right now , their folklore is loaded with sorcerers , warlocks , wizards , and what not . After all , whatever their past is , they 're primitive now . So those stories are going to grow and continue . Eventually , long before they really develop a stabilized ethic , someone 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what he 'll come up with ? " " Us ? " " Us , yes . Us , in a distorted form . " Kweiros nodded emphatically . " They will come to a full realization that there are advanced entities running around the cosmos , entities that have all kinds of mysterious powers . And they 'll invent still more powers and characteristics  --  mostly bad . " He spread his hands , then laid them on the desk in front of him . * * * " That way , they could develop a hopeless , planet-wide trauma  --  a sort of super inferiority complex  --  and they could contract on themselves , devote their time to an intensive study of demonology , and very possibly come apart at the seams . " Or , they could do something else . I was watching Elwar while I was checking that tape . Did you notice anything peculiar ? " " He seemed disturbed . " " As though he were sensing my thoughts ? " " Something like that . But  --  " Kweiros nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no trace of mental action . Right ? " " Yes , sir . " " That 's what I thought . " Kweiros shook his head and looked closely at Jaeger . " Can you imagine , " he added , " a primitive race with the power to detect a galactic by his thoughts ? And can you imagine that power developing until that detection is possible at interstellar ranges , with members of that race being able to pick up faint impressions from received thoughts  --  distorted impressions ? And can you imagine that same race , ignorant of the humanic equations , devoid of a stable ethic , superstitious , distrustful and fearful of advanced entities ? They would be undetectable by normal telepathic means , you know . And suppose they were disposed to destroy what they could not understand . " He frowned . Jaeger looked back at him , his eyes becoming wide . Suddenly , his gaze defocused and he looked aside , to stare unseeingly at the floor . " Something 's got to be done , sir , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done , " he agreed . " Of course , there 's another side to the picture . If this race develops and learns , they 'll be just as valuable to the galaxy as they would otherwise be dangerous . " He looked toward the door . " And our boy out there is one of the few who can help in this situation . He 's going to have to work out counter stories  --  amusing stories  --  about all those magical creatures his people tell about . He 's going to have to hint at the possibilities of close co-ordination and co-operation between members of his own species . And he 's going to have to suggest the possibility of friendly co-operation between his species and others . " He drew a deep breath . " And he 's going to have to do all this without taking any risk of exposing the existence of other , more advanced species in the galaxy . " He brushed a hand across his head , then pressed the back of his neck , kneading the skin . " These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'll have to get them circulated all over his planet , if he can . Possibly we can give him some indirect help , but he 's going to have to carry a good share of the load . " He knows his own people as we could never hope to . And he 'll have to be thoroughly educated , so he can say what he wants to . And he 'll have to be fully aware of the humanic equations and all their connotations . If he 's to have any direct help , he 'll have to choose his helpers from among his own people , and he 'll have to choose carefully . " Kweiros thrust at his temple with the heel of a hand , then shook his head violently . " Somehow , he 's going to have to accentuate any legends he may be able to find which present a favorable light on co-ordination and co-operation , and he 'll have to invent more . And all those other legends  --  the ones which treat of superstition and destructive force  --  will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submerged under a layer of amused condemnation , and kept there . All these things , that youngster is going to have to do . " It 's your job to help teach him . " * * * * * Forell watched his friend closely as the critic laid aside the last page . Andorra sat for a moment , his head cocked in thought . Then , he picked up the last page and looked at it again . Finally , he laid the sheet aside . He looked at his friend with a wry smile , then picked up his wineglass , looking at it quizzically . " Do you always give your own name to one of your characters ? " Forell 's grip tightened on the small object in his hand . " Oh , sure , " he said . " Gives me a better identification . If I can get into the story , it 's easier to draw the reader in . " He forced a casual smile . " I 'll change that name later , of course . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . " You know , " he added , " a couple of hours ago , I was almost ready to get excited about the idea of a cosmos full of super beings . And I even might have dreamed up something like this myself  --  and more than half believed it . " He shook his head . " But when a fantasist like yourself comes up with it , and makes it look so nicely possible , the idea almost looks foolish . After all , Elwar , if you actually were the guy in that little sketch of yours , you 'd hardly be asking me to read it , now would you ? " He looked down at the papers , then raised his head again , frowning . " ' He 'll have to choose his helpers from among his own people , ' " he quoted . " ' All these things , that youngster is going to have to do . ' " He sipped again from his glass , keeping a searching gaze on his friend . " And on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just might be asking me to read it , for one reason or another . " He raised his glass , examining the bright liquid within it . Elwar tensed , his hand coming part way out of his pocket . Suddenly , Andorra set the glass down and leaned forward , hands gripping his knees . " Tell me , Elwar , " he begged , " this is n't a hoax , is it ? Surely , no one could be so warped as to present a friend with something like this and then to laugh it off ? " Forell drew a deep breath and examined his companion closely . At last , his left hand relaxed a little . " It 's no hoax , " he admitted . Andorra sighed and leaned back . " And you can use help ? You 're asking me ? " He paused , waiting as Forell nodded , then spread his hands . " You know , " he said , " it should n't take me too long to fix it so I would not be missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the wall . " It must be quite a training course . " THE END
