In the aftermath of war , when allies are no longer in arms against the common peril , there arises the unpleasant problem of which ally must pay the other for services rendered . After World War I. the canard spread that France had even collected rent for the use of trenches on its soil . Last week South Korea 's President Syngman Rhee went just as far , if not much farther , in a bill for $684,600,000 that he sent to the U.N . Command , i.e. , to the U.S .. which foots almost all the bills . <P> The U.S. spent $22 billion and took 140,000 casualties in the Korean war . Since war 's end . the U.S. has contributed another $2 billion to rehabilitate South Korea and bolster its army . This was not enough for Syngman Rhee , whose mismanaged economy is in trouble and in need of money . His bill , submitted in infinite , frequently faulty detail , asks $471.7 million for U.N . use of land during the Korean war . <P> Next biggest item is building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.N.-built building space ( some 20 million sq . ft. of it ) than the U.N . Command is being asked to pay for . Rhee asks $60.8 million for transportation , although the U.N . has supplied his rickety rail system with 45 locomotives , 1,696 pieces of rolling stock , enough rails , switches and crossties for 1,811 miles of track . The U.N . has also built 2,138 miles of Korean highway , 525 bridges . Though Rhee asks $38.6 million for electricity , U.N . generating barges at Pusan and Inchon pump unmetered quantities of electricity into Korean homes and factories , at least double the army 's consumption . <P> If Syngman Rhee persists in pressing his exorbitant claims , he will be slapped right back with a bill for utilities supplied by the U.S.
