FEW minutes after he heard his son leave the house at 6:45 A.M. to go to work , Robert H. Niemeyer got up and dressed and ate breakfast alone . His wife had fixed breakfast , then gone back to bed : she 'd been up rather late the night before , having entertained the Homemakers Club , and she had a cold . The dining-room table was new . So was the television set Niemeyer had just tiled the kitchen walls and built new cabinets . The Niemeyers were " just getting to the point where we could afford to fix up the house a little . " Niemeyer left the house at 8:15 to go to work , as he had every workday for years . He was forty-seven years old , a man of average height , weight and appearance . He combed his black hair straight back . He wore ordinary inexpensive business suits and rather drab neckties . He had worked for the same company twenty-five years . He was a wholesale milk salesman . Except that for the last two years he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburb , Niemeyer had led an uneventful life . Even his antigambling activities had not been spectacular ; he had just been performing , rather quietly , what he considered his duty as a citizen . The morning was warm and beautiful , unseasonably warm . It was October 3 , 1951 . Niemeyer backed his small company car out of the garage and drove down the street away from his small white house , passing other houses much like his own . At - North Avenue , a divided-lane superhighway , he edged into the eastbound lane and settled down for an hour 's drive to his office near the center of Chicago . This morning he did not reach it . A Black Sedan and a Blue-Steel Pistol ITE had driven about four miles and he was pass -- 1 ling through a desolate stretch of swamp and prairie when a black sedan pulled alongside his car and crowded him off the road , and a man in the back seat aimed a blue-steel pistol at him . Niemeyer stopped . The man with the gun jumped out and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a dark , round-faced man ; short and very heavy , so thick-bodied he was almost round . Niemeyer never had seen him before . He got into Niemeyer 's car and so did another of the men  --  there were either three or four , probably four  --  and , jamming Niemeyer 's hat down over his eyes and shoving his head down between his knees almost under the dashboard , they drove on east , the sedan following . Soon they turned south on a narrow gravel road and stopped . The round man  --  he was the only one who spoke ? told Niemeyer to get out . He did . The round man said , " We 'll teach you to rape a twelve-year-old girl . " Niemeyer said , " I would n't do a thing like that . " And then , " You must have the wrong man . " The round man said , " What 's your name ? " " Robert Niemeyer . " " Who do you work for ? " " Bowman Dairy . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chief . Get in , " and they put him on the floor of the back seat of their sedan and drove off . He found he was lying on two baseball bats . In a desolate area ringed by distant factories , the car stopped . The round man said , " Get out of the car , " and Niemeyer said , " Yes , sir , " and , as ordered , walked a few steps off the narrow , cindered road . " Lay down , " the round man said , adding , " On your stomach . " They were in a weed-grown field , scrubby trees close by . Niemeyer lay down full length , face down , in his business suit in the weeds . The others began to beat him . They started by beating him on the heels , then on the tendons of his ankles , then his knees . They were using the baseball bats . They worked their way up , clubbing calves , thighs , hips , back and shoulders , then working down his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back , pushed his hat over his face , and did the same thing . Niemeyer felt the bones in his legs break . He did not lose consciousness . He remembers every blow . All the while the men did not say a word . And when they had finished they departed . Niemeyer could not move . Finally a car came along and Niemeyer sent the driver for help . An ambulance took him to the police station and a squad car brought his wife there . She got into the ambulance beside him , and as it started the long journey to the hospital she asked him what had happened . He said , " They got me on North Avenue . " She began to weep . She had been afraid of this for a long time  --  ever since , really , he had begun trying to stop organized gambling in their town . Many Americans deplore organized gambling . Few do anything about it . Niemeyer tried to . Was that why he was beaten almost to death ? Let us examine his background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling . We shall not learn who slugged him  --  two months after the crime , investigators had not solved it ? but we may learn something about the make-up and methods of a reformer , the nature and methods of reform 's shadowy enemy , the Syndicate , and the condition of a suburb the Syndicate invades . Robert Henry Niemeyer was born in Chicago , the son of a carpenter . He was of German descent . He was reared in an old German neighborhood on the northwest side of Chicago . Instead of attending high school , he went to work . When %e was twenty-three he married a neighborhood girl and they moved to the South Side . His wife is small , pert , red-haired , nervous and Irish . Their only child , Robert E. , was born two years after they were married . The Niemeyers occupied a series of flats on the South Side . They never were really happy with city living . They used to take rides out to the suburbs on Sunday afternoon , house hunting . Early in 1940 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bought a lot out in a new subdivision called Northlake and the Niemeyers went out and looked it over andbought one too . " We did n't have enough for the down payment , even , " Mrs. Niemeyer remembers , laughing . " We took a loan on our insurance policy to buy the lot . Then we got a loan on the lot to get money to build the house . " The lot cost $450 . ' They built the house themselves . They could n't afford to hire the work done . Mrs. Niemeyer has recalled , " I 've put up plasterboard , painted , insulated  --  done everything . " They built five rooms on the first floor and finished one room upstairs , all small . They planted three peach trees and two cherry trees in the back yard . " Pioneers " With Pride in Their Homes ALL around them was empty prairie . Running water , sewers and gas had not yet reached their street . Niemeyer used to haul their water in ten-gallon milk cans from a community water faucet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Niemeyer says . Before the war , this area was just wasteland . The Midland Development Company , of Chicago , developed Northlake ? laid out streets , sold lots and built houses , built a waterworks . Today about 5500 people live in Northlake . These are working people . A minister said recently , " These people took their life savings out of the bank and came out here with the kids . They 're buying things piece by piece ; just keeping their heads above water . " People eat supper in the kitchen in this town . They buy their " suites " of furniture on the installment plan ; their rooftops boast television aerials . They are intensely interested in their homes . Robert Niemeyer fitted into this community pattern perfectly . He never earned over $5000 a year . What extra money he had he put into improvements on his house . His son had to quit night school and go to work in a factory . Niemeyer was active is a homeowners ' group . He was a past master of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Community Methodist Church . His wife belonged to the church Women 's Cirele , to a canasta club and to the Homemakers Club . The Niemeyers used to supervise parties for neighborhood children in the community house . On Northlake Day , when the town had a carnival , Niemeyer worked in one of the booths , selling sandwiches , and his wife worked in another . Her friend , Mrs. McCool , has said , " If somebody in town was sick , the Niemeyers were the first to help . You know , take up a collection if someone dies , bring food in the day before the funeral . They were the best people . " On April 23 , 1949 , the citizens of Northlake voted to incorporate their town as a city . This meant electing city officers . Two local political parties arose . The Northlake Citizens Party chose as its candidate for mayor Eldon H. Hayes . The United Citizens Party invited Niemeyer to be its candidate . He declined because he had a deal pending to buy a business . The United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through and he ran as an independent candidate for mayor . Interest in the election was great  --  about 80 per cent of the registered voters voted . Niemeyer ran last . Hayes was elected . Now , Mayor Eldon H. Hayes is a pleasant , disarming man with a natural talent for personal politics . A stocky , dark-complexioned man of thirty-nine , he was raised on a farm . In Chicago he became a construction consultant to architects and contractors . He moved out to what a fool I 'd been ... 108 TFIE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 19 , 19 : , - without an O.K. " Such students of organized gambling as Sen. Estes Kefauver take it as axiomatic that , in general , organized gambling can not exist without the connivance , or at least the tolerance , of public officials . Mayor Hayes , when Niemeyer and others asked him about gambling , always said officially he knew of none . But one man recalls that Mayor Hayes told him privately and rather uneasily , " The Hamburger Palace is something I ca n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backing . This was no local cigar-store poker game that had come to Northlake . This was the Chicago Syndicate . Today the Syndicate big shots own suburban estates , they visit the most expensive night clubs and their wives wear diamonds . Somehow people forget that their estates and diamonds are bought with dirty money , that their power rests at bottom upon round-bodied sluggers with baseball bats . The Syndicate recently has been moving to the suburbs because the population in general has shifted there , policing there is harder , and Mayor Martin Kennelly has stopped wide-open horse betting in Chicago itself . Just so , twenty-five years ago it took over other suburbs , some of which became notorious for their wide-open gambling and prostitution . By early 1949 , when Northlake was born , the Syndicate had virtually forged a ring around Chicago . The Syndicate does not go where it is not wanted . In most places it met little or no opposition from the citizenry . But in Northlake it ran into Robert Niemeyer . Now this may be putting the matter a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forthwith cry warning . Let us see what he did do . One spring evening in 1949 while Niemeyer was running for mayor , he stopped in a tavern in town and a man he knew asked for his views on gambling . Niemeyer replied that if elected he would not allow gambling . The man asked , " What about the new place down at Wolf and Lake ? " ? that is , the Hamburger Palace . " It 's practically outside the town . Most people would n't object . And those fellows can do quite a bit for the city . They can give you four or five thousand dollars to pave the city 's streets  --  or for anything else you want to use it for . " " I told him , " Niemeyer recalls , " that I had seen the same thing happen in other suburbs and that once you accept a proposition from people like that , they own your town . I said no , absolutely not . " Niemeyer took this to be a bona-fide offer of a bribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , a stranger repeated the offer to Niemeyer 's son . These incidents convinced Niemeyer that organized gamblers were trying to move into Northlake and that they intended to purchase immunity , thereby corrupting Northlake 's public officials . He determined to stop them . Niemeyer was no bluenose . He played pinochle and penny-ante poker ; he often had a few drinks with friends . His motive was civic . His wife has said , " He wanted a decent place to live . " Niemeyer was proud of his home and proud of the town . Whenever someone asked Niemeyer to'perform a civic task , he felt bound to do so . Once , in 1999 , at the behest of the local newspaper publisher , Selby Maxwell , Niemeyer went with a delegation of citizens to the state 's attorney to complain about Louis Gauger 's tavern , a place which Niemeyer had forbidden his son to visit , and the tavern was raided . For a year Niemeyer did nothing  --  he felt Mayor Hayes " should be given a chance " to suppress gambling himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May , 1950 , Niemeyer went to see Mayor Hayes . With him went Maxwell , who in his newspaper already had begun to criticize Mayor Hayes ; the Reverend Milan Swasko , of the Northlake Lutheran Church ; and several other citizens . They found awaiting them not only Mayor Hayes but also businessmen who had supported Hayes politically , and most of the city officials . Niemeyer says , " I come right out and told Mayor Hayes that I did n't see how it was possible for this Hamburger Palace to operate without some ; body getting something out of it . The mayor replied that he knew of no gambling in Northlake . " The meeting broke up , " Niemeyer recalls , " without much being accomplished . " And so , alone , he went to the state 's attorney . State 's Attorney John S. Boyle had been trying to put pressure on the sherif and local officials to suppress garabling . To this end , one of his investigators , Anthony Gherscovich , had been obtaining evidence against handbooks . When Niemeyer told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gherscovich replied that he knew about them and would see what could be done about persuading Northlake officials to take some action . Back in Northlake , Niemeyer recalls , " I talked to anybody that 'd listen W me about gambling . But nobody was too much interested . " There was ne great public outcry against the Hamburger Palace . So Niemeyer subsided temporarily . Maxwell , however , in his newspaper sniped continually at the Hamburger Palace , Mayor Hayes and certain businessmen and tavernkeepers who supported the mayor . The wife of Ray Cochran , a thin , sharp-tongued metallurgist who had managed Hayes ' political campaign , started an opposition newspaper . Businessmen moved their advertising from Maxwell 's paper to the Cochran paper . City-council meetings became acrimonious . Mayor Hayes has recalled , " When I was elected , the council was split evenly . Well , for the first year I did n't have to cast the deciding vote a single time . We usta all sit down together and thresh out these things . " This era of good feeling now bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attorney raided the Hamburger Palace . Niemeyer had nothing to do with this directly , but he was elated . Niemeyer campaigned that spring of 1951 for the election of United Citizens aldermen in opposition toMayor Hayes men . Niemeyer hoped , by getting control of the city council , to force the appointment of a police chief who would shut down gambling . Gambling , however , was not an issue in this election . The big issue was the waterworks . The Midland Development Company owns the town waterworks . Mayor Hayes ' administration had proposed to buy the waterworks . Maxwell hinted at graft , which Mayor Hayes has denied . Mayor Hayes ' party lost the election . This gave the United Citizens a 4-2 majority in the city council . And at the first council meeting a United Citizens alderman moved to instruct the mayor to fire his police chief and city attorney . The mayor said  --  probably correctly ? that this was a usurpation of his power . " This provoked a lot of arguing and heckling , " Mayor Hayes recalls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Heck , had been unable to see the gambling in Northlake . The mayor replied the chief had investigated and found no gambling . The citizen said he knew better . The mayor invited him to sign a complaint . The citizen refused . The meeting got noisy . Niemeyer spoke . " I said that if action was not begun soon against gambling , I intended to go to the state 's attorney 's office and ask that a charge of malfeasance in office be brought against Mayor Hayes and several other persons . " Today Mayor Hayes is inclined to view that council meeting of May 8 , 1951 , rather lightly ? " just one political party trying to throw out the other one . " But Niemeyer feels that it was a major turning point : " After this meeting many people came to me and told me they were behind me a hundred per cent . Even people that had n't been interested before . " Robert Niemeyer had suddenly be'come the visible symbol of opposition to organized gambling in Northlake . Mrs. Niemeyer tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told him he could n't do nothing about it , " she recalls . " No one man could . " She was afraid . She even considered selling their house and went so far as to look for another . Her husband would n't hear of it . ( Recently in the hospital he told her , " Gee , I wish you 'd insisted on us moving . " ) They talked about his crusade many times , at supper , on Sunday drives . It got to be almost a family joke . Once their son said , " Daddy , you know what 's going to happen to you ? Someday they 're going to break both your arms and legs . " This , of course , was exactly what did happen to him . Niemeyer replied , " They do n't do that any more , that rough stuff . That was in the ' Twenties . " ? In August , Niemeyer told the state 's attorney that Mayor Hayes had not closed the Northlake handbooks . The state 's attorney raided them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the sheriff , a Republican , had been feuding desultorily about gambling ; now , in August , their skirmishing increased . In August , too , Mayor Hayes went to work for the Northlake Cement Company , a contracting firm that does a lot of work for the Midland Development Company . Maxwell criticized the mayor , recalling that Midland is the company which someday may sell its waterworks to Northlake . At about this same time , Niemeyer became head of the United Citizens Party . Everybody assumed he would run for mayor in 1953 , though he himself now says he did n't intend to . On September eighth , the Northlake police raided the Hamburger Palace . Mayor Hayes has said , " We 'd been building up our police force , spotting the place , and when we got ready , our police chief signed a warrant and knocked ' em over , that 's all . " Niemeyer recalls , " I met Chief Heck on the street one day and he told me about the raid , how they 'd got their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He told me they were going to raid the place from time to time , going to close them up . I really felt good . I felt that my going to the state 's attorney 's office had prompted the raid . I had told several people I 'd gone . My wife always said I should n't , but I 've always been open and aboveboard . " Less than a month later he was beaten almost to death . At first it was doubted that he would live . The baseball bats had fractured both ankles , his lower right leg in three places and his lower left leg in one , his right kneecap , pelvis , upper right arm , collarbone and several ribs . Public outcry was great . The Chicago Tribune said , " Gangsters rule this community . " The Sun-Times posted a $10,000 reward . In North-lake , rumors of a vigilante movement circulated . Led by the Rev. Mr. Swasko , citizens formed a crime commission . Maxwell demanded the resignation of Mayor Hayes and called a mass meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule . At a counter mass meeting , Cochran and other speakers defended Mayor Hayes , condemned Maxwell and decried the " bad publicity " Northlake was receiving . State 's Attorney Boyle declared , " No citizen is going to be intimidated just because he plans to give information to my office . " He sent out all his investigators , led by Chief Thomas Mclnerney , to raid every gambling joint in the county . And in Cicero , a town whose name has become a vaudeville synonym for hoodlumism , a strange thing happened : as the raiders herded gamblers out of the handbooks to the paddy wagons , citizens standing nearby cheered . " They were actually glad to see us bringing ' em in , " one of the raiders remembers somewhat wonderingly . " In Cicero . So it must not be the townsfolk . " That first day they brought in more than 300 persons . The sluggers were not among them . They questioned and cleared Louis Gauger , whose tavern had been raided upon Niemeyer 's complaint . They began looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hayes for palpable omission of duty in that he failed to suppress gambling  --  substantially the same charge Niemeyer had threatened to bring against the mayor . Mayor Hayes pleaded not guilty . Was Niemeyer slugged by the Syndicate ? Niemeyer himself is sure he was . Hoodlums say he was . Assistant State 's Attorney Peter Kuh says there 's no evidence of any other motive . On the other hand , Niemeyer divulged nothing the state 's attorney did n't already know . The Syndicate rarely risks public wrath by molesting a respectable citizen . Lately , however , the state 's attorney had been raiding Syndicate books and ordering Western Union to shut off their wire service . Maybe , by beating Niemeyer , the hoodlums intended to warn the state 's attorney to lay off . And to warn ordinary citizens in general not to meddle . On this theory , Niemeyer was selected as the victim almost at random . It is a chilling thought . The case involved much more than the beating of a man . Virgil Peterson , of the Chicago Crime Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete breakdown in democratic government . The gamblers think  --  and they are right to some extent  --  that they run the government . They look on decent citizens as interlopers . Public officials always use the excuse that the people want gambling . Well , maybe some people do  --  but Niemeyer did n't . And he was n't alone . No wonder decent people are afraid to exercise the prerogative of good citizenship in matters affecting organized crime . " Northlake represents many pleasant communities invaded by the mob . And Niemeyer represents many decent citizens . He was one of the few who felt he ought to do something beyond voting . No doubt he started out merely to get a handbook closed . But quickly he was caught up in much larger conflicts  --  conflicts , in all probability , he but poorly understood . There was the maneuvering for power of the politicians of Northlake . There was the complex warfare between the Republican sheriff and the Democratic state 's attorney of Cook County . There was the ancient invisible struggle of the underworld to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger crusade  --  the crusade of the American conscience against organized crime and corruption . No doubt Mayor Hayes , too , whatever his involvement  --  and it has not been proved  --  did not foresee the end . But once these powerful forces were set in motion , Niemeyer was trapped , and so , in another sense , was Hayes . The crime tore Northlake to pieces . The future of the town , for which all hands labored , is in doubt . Neighbors have become enemies . The political rivalry has become almost unbearably bitter . How does Mayor Hayes feel about the whole thing ? Sitting in his office at the Midland company , he said recently , " I 've worked very hard in this town . I used to spend less than an evening a week with my family , trying to get the city organized . It hurts very deeply to get a slap like this . I do n't mean to get emotional about it , but it hurts , and hurts badly . " He looked out the window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , my conscience is clear , and thank God for that . " What were his plans ? " Move away ? Why , no " ? as though surprised . " I love this town , I love my home . " And what about the Niemeyers ? Only their son was still at their home in Northlake , living under police guard , and he said if the squad car left he 'd leave too . Mrs. Niemeyer is afraid to stay there . She moves constantly , staying in Chicago with various friends , in hotels , different places . A policeman stands guard at her husband 's hospital room . " Some way to live , " Mrs. Niemeyer said recently . She was sitting in the hospital lobby . She intends to sell their house in Northlake . " I do n't know where we 'll go , " she says . " How can I know ? I 'm afraid they 'll follow us all the rest of our lives . " Upstairs in his room , Niemeyer was sitting in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinks " they " will let him and his family alone now , " if I behave  --  keep my mouth shut . " His hospital bills are going to be very large . Insurance will help some . He has no savings . His wife said , " And all he wanted to do was try to do good . How can one man do anything ? How can you , when your government and everybody else is in with ' em ? " Niemeyer looked at her sadly . Most of the time he is rather cheerful ? the doctors think he 'll be able to walk again someday , and he 's grateful that the sluggers left him one forearm he can use  --  but when he thinks about his wife , he reproaches himself . Was he going to continue his crusade ? He said slowly , " I feel that I 've brought an awful lot of suffering upon my wife . Out of respect to her , I 'll never again partake in any drive against gambling . Besides , I 've had enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
