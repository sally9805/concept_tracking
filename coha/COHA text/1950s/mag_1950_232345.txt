" It 's twenty-five years . . . since The New Yorker set up in business , " said a small passage in The New . Yorker 's Talk of the Town last week , " and things have changed either greatly or not at all . . . " Thus , with the elaborate casualness that is as much its trademark as the elegant Eustace Tilley who annually adorns its cover , did The New Yorkernote its 25th birthday . <P> Old New Yorker readers who scanned the anniversary issue might get a deceptive sense that things have changed not at all : with a sentimentality that he would loudly scorn , Editor Harold Ross had rounded up contributions from such time-honored New Yorker favorites as E. B. White , James Thurber , Ogden Nash , John McNulty , Peter Arno , Gluyas Williams and the late Helen Hokinson . Readers with a long memory could even pick up the fourth part of a " profile " * of the late Playwright Wilson Mizner where Alva Johnston left off eight years ago . <P> In its first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , humorous , satirical , but to be more than a jester . . . " It also announced firmly that it was not intended " for the old lady in Dubuque . " More than a jester , today 's New Yorker eyes far wider horizons than Manhattan 's skylines . It travels with its " farflung correspondents " all the way from Third Avenue 's saloons to Hiroshima , considers life and letters , as well as laughter , its province . Two-thirds of its 325,000 circulation is outside New York ; it has 69 subscribers in Dubuque . Harold Ross , founder , editor and principal curmudgeon , is still head man in what is far from a one-man show . Like the literate , civilized , incisive and frequently funny magazine he edits , Ross himself has changed greatly in some ways , in essence not at all . <P> Charmingly Churlish . At 32 , Colorado-born Harold Ross was an ex-itinerant newspaperman and ex-editor of the A.E.F. 's Stars and Stripes , a rumpled , rawboned man with electric hair . ( Dorothy Parker cracked that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) At 57 , Ross can afford a good tailor ( " I 'm a well-dressed man ! " he indignantly insists ) and curbs his hair , but he has somehow managed to retain the air of permanent dishevelment . Once ex-New Yorker Writer Margaret Case Harriman called Ross " that lovable old volcano , " and the late Alexander Woollcott described him as " Dodsworth , with an overlay of violence . " Ross is still personally noisy and professionally restrained , still charmingly churlish and intelligently ignorant , but his reputation for irascibility exceeds his performance . <P> Ross has denned editing as " quarreling with writers-same thing exactly . " His cardinal literary virtue is clarity ; he has a better eye for meaning and sense than an ear for sound . Confronted with the avantgarde , the experimental and the merely obscure , Ross remarks that if he does n't understand something , he wo n't print it . To help the writer " say what he is trying to say , " Ross reads almost every word that goes into The New Yorker ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot-long footnotes .
