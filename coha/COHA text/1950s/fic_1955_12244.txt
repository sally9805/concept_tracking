Place : The pastor 's office in Greenwood Church , at the left a door leads to the Sanctuary ; at the right , a door leads to a bedroom . Time : Present day . Place : Princeton , Michigan , U. S. A. ( The scene opens with Pastor Wylie seated at his desk looking over his calendar . Enter Dwight Granison looking around the office as though it looks new to him . ) PASTOR WYLIE Hello , Dwight . I did n't know you were in the building . DR . GRANISON Yes , Uncle Felton , I have been through the building and into the new annex . I see you people have put in a convalescent home and clinic since I left . PASTOR WYLIE It wo n't be long before we 'll have a real hospital connected with our church . DR . GRANISON I guess I finished my internship just in time to come in and give some service . Where did you get all that medical equipment ? PASTOR WYLIE You remember old Doctor George Ransom ? DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he dead ? PASTOR WYLIE No , no ! He retired last November on his 50th anniversary as a practicing physician and he donated his equipment to our convalescent home . p. 3 DR . GRANISON Wonderful ! That 's the best thing any retired physician can do . PASTOR WYLIE ( while dialing the telephone ) Did you notice the Sanctuary ? DR . GRANISON No ! Do n't tell me something new has been added there , too . PASTOR WYLIE You should certainly see that . We have a grand piano in there . DR . GRANISON ( happily ) Really ? PASTOR WYLIE Yes . Go try your hand on it . DR . GRANISON ( leaving the room ) Sure ! PASTOR WYLIE Hello , let me speak with Brother Jeremy , please . Hello Brother Jeremy . . . . Yes , I 'm returning the call . Yes . . . yes . . . well . . . You better see me before the meeting starts . . . . What time ? Suppose you come over now . . . . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter to talk over the phone . ( The piano is heard in the distance ) . . . Can you come over within thirty minutes ? Good . . . oh , I did n't tell you that Dwight Granison is back in town , did I ? . . . Well he 's here and he thinks he 'll set up his office here in Princeton . If he does , we can use him in our convalescent home . . . . I think I could get him to conduct a free clinic at least once a week for the benefit of our parishioners . He 's looking more like me they say . You would think that he was my son rather than my sister 's boy . . . oh , yes , I 'll remember . But I think ( enter Dr. Granison ) you should n't be so hard on these people . They had very good reasons for joining our church . . . Judith is a very brilliant girl and she should be given a chance to work in the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a daughter and you would not like anyone to mistreat Luellen . Yes , yes . . . yes . . . well , come over before they get here . The meeting will open at 8 o'clock . If you come now ( looking at his watch ) , you 'll have about thirty minutes to talk it over . I 'll see you then . ( Hangs up receiver ) p. 4 DR . GRANISON ( disgustedly ) Was that Brother Jeremy ? PASTOR WYLIE ( frowning and glancing down at his desk ) Yes . DR . GRANISON Is he still as contentious as ever about everything ? PASTOR WYLIE You know Hayman Jeremy , do n't you ? DR . GRANISON I think I do . PASTOR WYLIE Well , he has n't changed ! He does n't want the Delfords in our church . DR . GRANISON Who are the Delfords ? PASTOR WYLIE A family who quit Holy Star and joined our church . DR . GRANISON ( surprisingly ) What ? PASTOR WYLIE Yes , Holy Star ! DR . GRANISON ( surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WYLIE Yes , he 's been in hot water over there for some time . His board members asked for his resignation ; when they did that , Judith Delford joined here and soon brought her brother Frank , her sister Florence and her Aunt Betsy . DR . GRANISON ( questioningly ) Judith  --  not the little lady of drama ( smiles with pleasant remembrances ) p. 5 PASTOR WYLIE Yes , Judith ! DR . GRANISON What happened over at Holy Star ? Why did they ask Elder Cohart to resign ? PASTOR WYLIE ( his eyes are roaming as though he were concealing the facts ) Elder Cohart has been taking in members of the common class ; but his parishioners thought that such people would reflect upon the dignity of their historic church and its traditions . ( Dr. Granison frowns ) You see , Elder Cohart invites everybody  --  rich or poor , white  --  red or brown . He is a liberalist . He preached a sermon once on " De-segregation of Churches . " Immediately after , a great controversy arose . The board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismiss a certain family who had just joined there and he would n't do it . He was threatened and he ignored the threat . Finally he was forced to resign . ( He shrugs his shoulders in finality ) DR . GRANISON ( puzzled ) That 's a shame ! PASTOR WYLIE Judith is a very serious minded person . She practices her religion very devoutly . She had conferences with me from time to time ; and she 's revealed that her aim in joining our church is to show , not only to Holy Star and the people of Princeton , but to the entire populace the way she feels Christianity should work throughout the whole world . p. 6 DR . GRANISON Quite an unusual young woman , is n't she ? PASTOR WYLIE Yes , and her brother Frank is a fine person . DR . GRANISON What does he do ? PASTOR WYLIE I think he 's a radio technician , but he 's not employed now . He 's been in the army , in the Battle of Iwo Jima . He said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War , he said is so horrible that he decided to love his neighbor , live long in peace , rather than hate and meet with an untimely death , or die unsaved . DR . GRANISON He 's a wise guy . You mentioned an aunt . Who is she . . . ? PASTOR WYLIE ( interrupting ) Oh , she 's a fine old lady . I suppose Aunt Betsy , as they call her , must be about 85 years old . . . rather feeble . . . her mind is not always so clear , but she 's very witty at times . Under pressure , she has some kind of spells which Judith says have been persistent for about five years . DR . GRANISON ( sadly ) That 's too bad . PASTOR WYLIE But our people have received the Delfords well . Hayman Jeremy 's family , with the exception of Luellen , is contentious at times , but the Delfords are not aware of it . Brother Jeremy . . . well , you know him . p. 7 DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh yes . She 's now a teacher in the public schools here . In fact , she just won First State Award for being the best teacher of gymnastics . DR . GRANISON I do n't wonder that she got it , Uncle Felton . As beautiful as she is  --  anybody would give her an award . PASTOR WYLIE ( smiling at the younger man ) And she 's a girl of beautiful character , as well . DR . GRANISON I ca n't say as much for her father , though . How does she react to the Delfords ? PASTOR WYLIE She and Judith are very good friends . But Brother Jeremy . . . he does n't want the Delfords in our church at all . He 's trying to find every reason why they should not have been admitted to our membership . ( sound of footsteps ) DR . GRANISON ( softly ) Here he comes . ( enter Brother Jeremy ) PASTOR WYLIE ( shaking hands ) It did n't take you long to get here . BROTHER JEREMY ( turning to Dwight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 8 DR . GRANISON Fine , fine . . . it 's good to see you again . BROTHER JEREMY And it 's great to have you home again . You came at the right time . We need you . DR . GRANISON I hope I can be of some benefit . PASTOR WYLIE Just do n't give us a dose of strychnine for a dose of penicillin . ( They all laugh . ) DR . GRANISON Where is that beautiful daughter of yours ? BROTHER JEREMY She 's home , but she 'll be at the meeting tonight . DR . GRANISON I ca n't make it tonight . I have an engagement . ( putting on his overcoat and gloves ) I do hope you people will have a good meeting . Good night . ( Exits ) PASTOR WYLIE Good night , Dwight . BROTHER JEREMY ( hesitantly ) What I wanted to know is this . . . are you giving the Delfords any active parts in the church 's program for this year ? PASTOR WYLIE Yes , I have a definite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEREMY Are they eligible for appointments to head auxiliaries ? p. 9 PASTOR WYLIE Sure , why not ? BROTHER JEREMY ( flatly ) I do n't feel that they should take leadership in anything . They think they 're supposed to lead in everything . PASTOR WYLIE Brother Jeremy , they came to our church because they resented this same kind of an attitude which existed in the hearts and minds of the very people they left behind . Are we going to do the same thing to them ? BROTHER JEREMY I 'm looking out for the interest of the church . If you appoint either one of those Delfords to a leading role in the program , you 'll tear up the church . PASTOR WYLIE ( a significant pause ) And that is what you think ? BROTHER JEREMY ( confidently ) Yes ! PASTOR WYLIE I ca n't agree with you . BROTHER JEREMY ( sharply ) I 'll be frank and admit that I am among those who do not want them here . PASTOR WYLIE I have n't heard complaints from anyone . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we now have the convalescent home , the new chapel , and the Mobile Church . The church needs as much talent as it can get . Judith is an artist , a singer and a play-wright . She is the very person to head our special day events , and I do n't think the congregation would object to that . p. 10 BROTHER JEREMY Just try it and see what happens . ( voices and footsteps outside ) PASTOR WYLIE I think the Delfords are coming . ( enter Judith and Frank ) PASTOR WYLIE AND BROTHER JEREMY ( almost simultaneously ) Good evening . ( shaking hands ) Good evening . JUDITH DELFORD Well , have you people worked as hard today as I have ? FRANK DELFORD ( happily ) Do n't mind her . She does n't work hard  --  lets it all out on her brother . PASTOR WYLIE She has a fine brother . BROTHER JEREMY I think they both are fine . JUDITH DELFORD I called Luellen and she is on the way . ( Luellen enters ) Oh , there she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUELLEN Worked ! Who wants to work ! ( They all laugh . Enter Brother Daniel and Nurse Sarah Kirkwood . ) BROTHER DANIEL AND SARAH KIRKWOOD Good evening , everybody . p. 11 PASTOR WYLIE ( looking at his watch ) Now , I believe we 're all here . Let us stand . ( All stand . ) Brother Jeremy , lead us in prayer . BROTHER JEREMY God , our Father , we thank Thee for this opportunity to praise Thy name , and for those who have cast their lots with us . We ask Thee to bless them in Thine own way and for the good of Thy church and Thy people . We ask Thee to guide us in our thoughts and in our judgment . Amen . PASTOR WYLIE Ladies and gentlemen , I have called you together to discuss with you the special events of our church calendar for this year . As you know , we now have a convalescent home , and a Mobile Church . In connection with these two additions to our program , we need a special day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church ? PASTOR WYLIE It is the church 's own bus operating as a Sunday School and church on the side of the streets on Sunday mornings in blighted areas . It operates where children do not go to any Sunday School . The bus is equipped with an amplifier for playing records of sacred music in order to attract children from the streets . If and when they come in , they are taught the Sunday School lesson as the children are in any other Sunday School . p. 12 FRANK DELFORD Good idea ! Then what ? PASTOR WYLIE Those on the bus serve as social workers as well as Sunday School teachers . They observe the material needs of the children and report it to the church . When the church supplies the needs of the children , the bus brings them to the regular church Sunday School where they become members of the regular church school . JUDITH DELFORD Oh , how interesting ! BROTHER DANIEL Yes , a new phase of evangelism . PASTOR WYLIE These things require much work and much money . Since most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must create some interests which will bring in some money . LUELLEN ( quickly ) Let us present Miss Delford in a concert . BROTHER DANIEL ( enthusiastically ) Yes , yes . PASTOR WYLIE I am appointing Miss Delford to be Chairman of all special events of the year , which will include annual artist night , annual Biblical drama night , ( Jeremy and Sarah Kirkwood look a bit flushed ) Easter egg hunt for the children and one annual church outing day . Does that meet the approval of all ? p. 13 ALL ( in unison ) Good ! Good ! BROTHER JEREMY What about Sarah Kirkwood as a co-chairman ? PASTOR WYLIE I would prefer Sarah Kirkwood to be the head nurse of our convalescent home . FRANK DELFORD Oh , and she is a nurse ? SARAH KIRKWOOD Five years experience . . . I 'm a pianist , too . JUDITH DELFORD ( she smiles faintly ) Fine ! I can use you . PASTOR WYLIE Now , the first event will take place on the night of March twelfth , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have annual Biblical drama night . I am appointing you , Miss Jeremy , to assist Miss Delford in her work . She will be able to use you in the outdoor work because you are so good in gymnastics and drama . LUELLEN I 'm with you . ( Brother Jeremy looks at her with disgust ) Just say the word . JUDITH DELFORD Oh , I know you are , Luellen. ( the telephone rings ) We 're all going to enjoy working together . PASTOR WYLIE ( at the telephone ) Hello ; yes , this is Pastor Wylie . Oh , I 'm so sorry , I 'll be right over . ( to the group ) That was Mrs. Conway . Her mother has taken a turn for the worse and she wants me to come to the hospital immediately and pray with her . So I 'll have to go . But , Brother Jeremy will finish explaining to you the ways and means for making the program work . I had about finished anyway . ( Putting on his coat , but leaving his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope Mrs. Conway gets better . She 's such a fine lady . PASTOR WYLIE I let Dr. Granison use my car tonight since his is under repair . So I 'll have to ask Brother Daniel to take me to the hospital . BROTHER DANIEL ( getting on his top coat ) Of course . I 'll be glad to . LUELLEN Pastor , are you going by way of the arena ? BROTHER DANIEL Yes , we 'll drive directly by it . LUELLEN May I come along ? I have a gym class meeting there at 9:15 . PASTOR WYLIE Now , young Miss , I did n't dismiss the meeting . LUELLEN ( begging sweetly ) Please , Pastor , may I ? PASTOR WYLIE This time . . . . LUELLEN Judith does n't mind , do you , dear ? JUDITH DELFORD No , no . I 'll call you tomorrow . FRANK DELFORD Judith is not the only one being left here . Is she ? LUELLEN ( smiles ) Men are always glad to see the women go , are n't they ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's go , children . ( they all exit . ) BROTHER JEREMY ( takes the pastor 's chair ) First , I want to commend you , Miss Delford , for the part which you and your family are playing in making democracy and Christianity work in the church . We are very glad to have you people in our church and as the clerk of the church , I take this opportunity to welcome you again . JUDITH DELFORD Thank you . FRANK DELFORD We like it here . BROTHER JEREMY ( shyly ) Now , of course , this is a church like other churches . Things do not always go smoothly . SARAH KIRKWOOD No , not all the time . FRANK DELFORD Oh , well , that is to be expected . JUDITH DELFORD Of course ! BROTHER JEREMY But feel free to call on me at any time . I am with you ! And my daughter , Luellen , is very fond of you . FRANK DELFORD She 's a beautiful girl . BROTHER JEREMY But do n't tell her . ( All laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . BROTHER JEREMY ( winking at Sarah Kirkwood ; this is not noticed by Judith and Frank . ) There is a young physician here whom I fear will soon win her . I would n't like to see her get married right now . SARAH KIRKWOOD Well , she seems very serious at times . BROTHER JEREMY Let 's not talk about it . ( they all laugh ) Suppose we get down to business ( to Judith ) Now , the treasurer of the church will furnish you with the necessary funds with which to promote your special events . You tell him how much you need and he will notify me and I will write the check . If you have any trouble , just let me know and I shall come to your rescue . JUDITH DELFORD ( pleased ) Thank you . FRANK DELFORD You have n't heard her sing yet , Brother Jeremy . Most of her concerts given at our former church have been sellouts ; and I know that many of the people from that church will come to hear her again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to all this . JUDITH DELFORD Sarah , wo n't you come by tomorrow and let us have a little rehearsal ? p. 17 SARAH KIRKWOOD Yes , I 'll be glad to come . BROTHER JEREMY Sarah is some pianist . I know that concert artists use their own accompanists , but if you ever run into difficulties in getting your own accompanist , try Sarah . FRANK DELFORD It sounds like a good idea . BROTHER JEREMY Well , that 's all for now . Please dismiss us , Mr. Delford . FRANK DELFORD " Let the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in Thy sight , ( Jeremy and Kirkwood look under their foreheads at each other ) O , Lord , my strength and my Redeemer . " ( Jeremy and Kirkwood lift their heads too soon . ) Dismiss us , O Lord , but not from Thy holy presence . Amen . ( Judith and Frank put on their coats while Kirkwood and Jeremy hesitate and then slowly get their coats . ) JUDITH DELFORD I 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what time ? JUDITH DELFORD How about 5 P.M. ? SARAH KIRKWOOD O.K. JUDITH AND FRANK Good night . p. 18 SARAH AND BROTHER JEREMY Good night . ( as they disappear , Brother Jeremy and Sarah Kirkwood look hypocritically at each other and smile . ) BROTHER JEREMY ( gathering up books and papers from the top of the desk and placing them in the desk drawers ) Sarah , did you hear what I told him ? SARAH KIRKWOOD I certainly did . BROTHER JEREMY I wanted to make him feel that there is no chance for him . I do n't want any foolishness out of him when it comes to Luellen . SARAH KIRKWOOD I do n't blame you . BROTHER JEREMY Let his love be to his own . ( both laugh ) Our pastor is acting very strangely . I do n't see why he took them in here . This church is going from bad to worse . . . and listen , Sarah , if she should ask you to play for her concert , accept graciously and work with her until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour before time and tell her that you have become ill very suddenly . SARAH KIRKWOOD That 's a good trick to pull on her . I will . . . . ( Brother Daniel enters ) BROTHER DANIEL Pastor Wylie left his gloves . p. 19 SARAH KIRKWOOD Did n't he get to the hospital yet ? BROTHER DANIEL Oh yes , I 've taken him home already . He sent me up here for his gloves . . . . BROTHER JEREMY ( pointing ) There they are . BROTHER DANIEL I thought you had left . BROTHER JEREMY Not yet , Sarah and I were just talking about the delicate thing the pastor has just done . BROTHER DANIEL ( disgusted ) Brother Jeremy , I wish you would come to yourself . Pastor Wylie 's leadership has been very commendable all along . Why question his judgment on this program ? BROTHER JEREMY Commendable ? SARAH KIRKWOOD How so . . . ? BROTHER DANIEL ( in a severe tone ) When he purchased the bus for the street Sunday School , you did n't want that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want that either . BROTHER JEREMY ( angrily ) Who said so ? BROTHER DANIEL You know how you argued in the board meeting about it . Now the whole city is praising the program . p. 20 SARAH KIRKWOOD Greenwood Church always had an outstanding program long before we ever knew that a Felton Wylie existed . BROTHER DANIEL But you do n't want white people in our church . That 's un-Christian . BROTHER JEREMY ( hotly ) They would n't have Negroes in their church ! BROTHER DANIEL They ? What they ? That 's the reason why the Delfords are here . They resented that attitude in the parishioners of Holy Star . Frank told me that when that family of Negroes joined their church , the board met and threatened to put Elder Cohart out if he did not dismiss them immediately . SARAH KIRKWOOD ( hotly ) So , let us do unto them ! BROTHER DANIEL ( continuing ) There are many other members of that congregation like the Delfords . Perhaps Elder Cohart had too many on his board like you two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . BROTHER JEREMY ( staring at Brother Daniel ) Why do n't you stop being silly and wake up ? There are other girls here that are just as intelligent as Judith . BROTHER DANIEL ( angrily ) Brother Jeremy , this is no reflection at all on the intelligent youth of Greenwood . p. 21 SARAH KIRKWOOD ( loudly ) This is not the time to appoint her . She has n't been here long enough . BROTHER DANIEL ( gently ) How long does one have to wait in heaven before he gets his crown ? ( There is silence . ) The Church can not afford to work slowly in an atomic age . It has already lagged too far behind . . . waiting for legislations , Supreme Courts to say Thou shalt not segregate . . . " Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy mind and thy neighbor as thyself . " BROTHER JEREMY ( very clearly disgusted with this ) Quit preaching ! BROTHER DANIEL You need a sermon ! Pastor Wylie has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white woman member , nor as the best , prepared from a standpoint of intellect , but as one of us . . . as a Christian . That 's all there is to it ! BROTHER JEREMY You 're talking utter nonsense ! BROTHER DANIEL ( angrily ) No ! The church needs my voice ! And Mrs. Kirkwood . . . I 'm surprised at you . . . saying she has n't been here long enough . Twelve months is long enough time to destroy the world ; and mark this , it 's going to take the power of God through His church to save the world from atomic destruction . Ask Frank Delford and he 'll tell you he does n't want any more of it . p. 22 BROTHER JEREMY ( interrupting angrily ) Do n't say Delford 's name again . You stoogie ! BROTHER DANIEL ( retorting hotly ) I 'm not a stoogie ! How dare you say such a thing ? BROTHER JEREMY Because that 's what you are ! Nothing else ! BROTHER DANIEL If I am , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a fool for the devil . BROTHER JEREMY Are you calling me a fool ? BROTHER DANIEL ( staring him in the eye ) Thou sayest . BROTHER JEREMY ( putting his right hand in his pocket ) I dare you to say it again ! BROTHER DANIEL ( smoothly and looking him in the eye ) I said I had rather be a stoogie for God 's man than to be a fool for the devil . . . . ( They stare at each other , Brother Jeremy clenches his fists , and turns aside as Brother Daniel holds his position . ) CURTAIN p. 23 Act 1 , Scene 2 Place : Home of the Delfords , living room , with chairs , table , magazine rack with magazines . Time : March 12 , 8 A.M. ( Judith enters with the newspapers and calls to Florence who enters with a pan and a dish towel . ) JUDITH DELFORD Florence , here 's a notice about the concert tonight . . . " Judith Delford , recently employed as a television artist , will appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Streets , tonight at 8:15 . Judith is a member of the Greenwood church , which is a Negro congregation . " FLORENCE DELFORD ( interrupting angrily ) Why do they always have to say a Negro congregation ? I wish . . . ( biting her lips , throws a pan on the floor angrily . ) ( Enter Aunt Betsy ) AUNT BETSY Florence . . . ! What 've I told you about that temper of yours ? FLORENCE DELFORD ( shyly ) Aunt Betsy , whenever a Negro is involved in anything , they always , always say Negro . They 're just trying to humiliate Judith . AUNT BETSY Judith does n't mind ! Be sure it 's not you who is humiliated ! JUDITH DELFORD ( continuing to read ) " The young singer will be supported at the piano by Jack Russell , organist of Holy Star , the church to which Judith was once connected . " ( to Florence ) They ca n't humiliate me . I wo n't let them . p. 24 FLORENCE DELFORD You 're too soft ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JUDITH DELFORD ( firmly , but in a low voice ) Florence , God is my refuge and my strength . A very present helper in trouble . FLORENCE DELFORD But you must learn how to help yourself . JUDITH DELFORD ( calmly ) Florence , are you ashamed to be a member of Greenwood church ? FLORENCE DELFORD ( a pause , silence ) Ask me no questions , I 'll . . . AUNT BETSY Florence ! Go to your room ! FLORENCE DELFORD ( exits looking back at Judith ) You think you 're " it " just because you 've got a job on television . JUDITH DELFORD ( stares . . . tearful ) What . . . next ? ( walks to the window sobbing ) AUNT BETSY ( walking behind Judith ) Judith , dear . ( Pauses . There is a tenseness in the living room . ) JUDITH DELFORD My sister . . . my only sister . p. 25 AUNT BETSY Florence does n't feel well this morning . . . do n't let it upset you . Take hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concert for tonight , you must be ready for it . Come , sit down . ( Judith sits hesitantly , ponders as Aunt Betsy walks the floor , her pace increases until it becomes noticeable to Judith . ) JUDITH DELFORD ( excitedly ) Aunt Betsy ! ( rushes to Aunt Betsy who is now making weird noises with her lips and through her nose ) Aunt Betsy , Aunt Betsy . Oh . . . my Aunt Betsy ! ( shaking her and rubbing her throat . ) Oh , God , please , please ! FLORENCE DELFORD ( rushing in ) Judith , what 's the matter ? ( very alarmed ) JUDITH DELFORD I do n't know . You 're the cause of this , Florence . Bring a pan of ice water and some towels . ( Aunt Betsy begins shaking as she lies prostrate on the floor ) Hurry , Florence ! FLORENCE DELFORD ( returning with the water and a wet cloth ) Oh God , forgive me . Do n't let Aunt Betsy die . JUDITH DELFORD Get the electric pad and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? JUDITH DELFORD Look in the cabinet in the bathroom . ( Florence returns with the pad and plugs it in the wall . A few moments of strained quiet . ) AUNT BETSY ( opening her eyes ) Where am I ? ( very weakly ) JUDITH DELFORD You 're home , with Florence and Judith . FLORENCE DELFORD I 'm here , Aunt Betsy . AUNT BETSY ( slowly ) Are you behaving , Florence ? FLORENCE DELFORD ( tearfully ) I 'm so sorry , Aunt Betsy . Please forgive me. ( hugging Aunt Betsy ) I would n't harm you for anything . I . . . did n't . . . know . ( Aunt Betsy rises , Florence turns to Judith , kissing her ) Judith . . . please forgive me. ( door bell rings , Florence goes to the door ) It 's Brother Jeremy and Luellen . ( Aunt Betsy lies down on the couch ) Hello , come in , wo n't you ? JUDITH DELFORD ( showing signs of strain ) Oh Brother Jeremy , Luellen , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luellen gives a covered pie plate to Judith and a box of rolls ) p. 27 BROTHER JEREMY She brought you a pie and some rolls . LUELLEN We did n't want you and Florence to do so much of the cooking on the day of your concert . ( passing the box to Judith ) JUDITH DELFORD Thank you . It 's so very thoughtful . FLORENCE DELFORD How kind you people are . BROTHER JEREMY ( laughing ) Luellen makes good rolls . We want to share them with you . LUELLEN And the pie , I hope you like it . FLORENCE DELFORD Ummmmmm . . . blueberry pie ! ( door bell rings , Judith goes to the door ) LUELLEN ( to Florence ) Aunt Betsy does n't feel well ? FLORENCE DELFORD ( slowly ) No , she . . . JUDITH DELFORD ( with a suitbox in her hands ) Oh , look , everybody , I want you to see the dress I rented for the change of costume tonight . LUELLEN Good idea . Let 's see how you look ! FLORENCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets ready to sing " The Queen of Beersheba. " p. 28 JUDITH DELFORD By the way , Brother Jeremy , did you prepare the pastor 's study so that I can use it for a dressing room ? BROTHER JEREMY Of course I did ! You know I would n't disappoint you . JUDITH DELFORD ( unfolding the dress ) You are always so kind , Brother Jeremy ! LUELLEN How gorgeous ! ( taking hold of the dress ) Oh , I can already see you in that , Judith . BROTHER JEREMY It 's quite beautiful . I suppose that would cost a lot of money , would n't it ? JUDITH DELFORD Oh yes . . . If I had bought it , it would be about three hundred dollars . LUELLEN ( gasps ) Wow ! FLORENCE DELFORD That 's right . That 's why Judith rented it . She could n't afford to buy one like it at this time . ( Aunt Betsy rises ) LUELLEN Hello , Aunt Betsy. ( embracing her ) Are n't you feeling well ? AUNT BETSY I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know what you always tell us . You 'll have to take your own medicine . p. 29 JUDITH DELFORD ( placing the dress in the box ) That 's right . Day in and day out , she 's saying either to me or Florence , " Hold on to your faith , let nothing move you . " LUELLEN And what you do n't know , God can tell you , and what you do n't see , God can show you . BROTHER JEREMY AND FLORENCE ( together ) And what you do n't have , God can give you ! ( all laugh ) BROTHER JEREMY She says it in a comical way but there 's so much truth in it . ( all chuckle ) Luellen , we must be going . ( a pause ) . . . But first , shall we pray with Aunt Betsy and for the success of the program tonight ? ( with his hand on Aunt Betsy 's head ) Dear Heavenly Father , we thank Thee for these Thy servants whom Thou hast given unto us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this soul who is a mother to these children . Heal her body , if it be Thy will . ( turning to Judith and taking her right hand ) Forget not , O Lord , this young woman who is a pioneer for Thy church of the world , the program in which she is to appear tonight . Let it be flawless and without blemish . Amen . JUDITH DELFORD ( seriously ) Thank you , Brother Jeremy . And may the blessings of God be upon you . . . You are always so kind and thoughtful . p. 30 FLORENCE DELFORD We 're always glad to have someone pray for Aunt Betsy . She had . . . one of those spells this morning . . . not too long ago . JUDITH DELFORD Yes , and they always leave her so weak . BROTHER JEREMY How long has she been having these spells ? JUDITH DELFORD About five years now . They seem to be growing worse . LUELLEN Does n't anything help ? JUDITH DELFORD Physicians do n't seem to have much success in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luellen . JUDITH DELFORD Thanks again , Luellen . LUELLEN You 're always welcome , you know . AUNT BETSY Tell Mrs. Kirkwood to call me tonight since neither of us can go to the concert . LUELLEN Yes , Aunt Betsy , I shall . ( Florence goes to the rear of the room and looks at a magazine as Aunt Betsy goes to a window and looks out ) FLORENCE DELFORD ( keeping an eye on Aunt Betsy ) See you tonight , Judith . BROTHER JEREMY ( holding up his hand ) I 'm keeping my fingers crossed . p. 31 JUDITH DELFORD ( closing the door ) I 'll be seeing you . ( goes to the door hurriedly and calls ) Brother Jeremy . BROTHER JEREMY ( coming back to the door as Luellen tarries ) Yes , Miss Delford ? JUDITH DELFORD I think we should make one last check on the spelling of names of the composers .

( both laugh ) There 's one thing very humiliating to an artist and that is to have the name of a composer misspelled on her program . BROTHER JEREMY ( writing and spelling at the same time ) Strauss , Bach , Haydn , Chopin . JUDITH DELFORD Right . Now , when will you have them off the press ? BROTHER JEREMY I 'll have them off and delivered to the church by 4 o'clock . My printers are very fast and do good work . p. 32 JUDITH DELFORD Splendid . Then I 'll see you tonight . ( Florence sits on settee ) BROTHER JEREMY Until then . . . . ( exits . ) AUNT BETSY ( walks slowly to chair and sits with her eyes still on Florence , Florence looks very embarrassed . ) Judith , sit there on the settee with Florence . ( Judith sits ) Now , Florence , that mad fit which you had is not at all commendable . You 're not fooling anyone ! You 're ashamed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the color of the people and the pastor . FLORENCE DELFORD ( embarrassed ) I only said that . . . AUNT BETSY ( interrupting ) Florence , I 've taught you the Bible from early childhood . You seem to be the stony ground on which my seeds have fallen . You remember I read to you the parable of the Sower in which it said , " A Sower went forth to sow and some seeds fell by the wayside and some on the stony ground . ( Judith listens with interest ) He that received the seeds into stony places , the same is he that heareth the word of God with joy and has no root in himself , but just for a little while , but when tribulation arises because he is trying to do the word , he is immediately offended . " Remember , Florence , we have to reap what we sow . Now , it was Judith 's idea that we join Greenwood Church . It was a good thought because it makes the church . . . not a Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church as Christ would have it if he were here today . Now , if trouble arises because of it ( in a preaching manner ) , hold on to your Faith . Let nothing move you ! What you do n't know , God can tell you ; what you do n't see , God can show you , and what you do n't have , God can give you . If you have the right thought to do the right thing , put the thought to good use . If you bury that thought , you will be like the man who buried his talent . He was cast into outer darkness , where there were weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth . p. 33 JUDITH DELFORD Oh Aunt Betsy , what a beautiful thought ! I think I shall present those two parables for my annual Biblical drama . ( with her eyes lifted as if in oratory ) A Sower went forth to sow , and reaping where you did not sow . I can see just how it should be acted . AUNT BETSY Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Judith smiles , a pause ) Judith ? Love your sister ? JUDITH DELFORD I do . AUNT BETSY Florence , love your sister and fight for her . Aunt Betsy will not be with you always . FLORENCE DELFORD I will , Aunt Betsy . AUNT BETSY Lie down Judith . . . rest for the program tonight . Florence , hang up the dress so that it will not be wrinkled . ( Florence gets a hanger for the dress ) Will anybody stay in the dressing room tonight while you are performing , Judith ? JUDITH DELFORD I . . . I . . . guess so . AUNT BETSY ( emphatically ) There should be someone there . That dress costs a lot of money . . . and  --  oh yes , did you tell Brother Jeremy to check the program ? JUDITH DELFORD Sure , Aunt Betsy . You were standing right here . ( Florence slowly exits while Aunt Betsy gazes pathetically at her ) p. 34 AUNT BETSY Oh , what did you say , Judith ? JUDITH DELFORD ( walking slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Betsy . AUNT BETSY ( persuasively ) Go and lie down . . . Judith , darling . Go lie down so that you can be beautiful tonight . ( Judith kneels briefly at the settee as Aunt Betsy looks on tenderly , then crawls upon it and lies down . ) CURTAIN@@ Place : Greenwood Church Sanctuary ; at the right , a door which leads to the pastor 's study , the door is labeled Pastor 's Study , up stage is another door . Time : 5 P.M. ( almost dark ) ( Brother Jeremy enters with hands and face disguised as a white man , wearing mismatched trousers and coat and a sport shirt with open collar and carrying a piece of iron . Cautiously he approaches the altar where flowers have been placed in vases on either side . He tears up the flowers and scatters them over the floor . Cautiously he listens , then approaches the piano and rips the keys off with the iron . He notices a microphone , he follows the wire , then cuts it . He hears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flees through the up-stage door . Pastor Wylie is seen entering the door of the pastor 's study . ) PASTOR WYLIE ( listens as though he has heard something . He walks suspiciously into the sanctuary , notices the flowers on the floor ; looks bewildered , looks toward the piano , he gasps . . . rushes toward the up-stage door and searches the place . Then rushes to the telephone in his study and dials . ) Brother Jeremy  --  please ! When do you expect him ? As soon as he comes in , please have him call Pastor Wylie . I am at the church in the study ; tell him it 's very important . Thank you ! p. 36 BROTHER DANIEL ( enters the sanctuary from down-stage just as Pastor Wylie hangs up the receiver . ) Hello , Pastor ! PASTOR WYLIE ( distressed ) God sent you here , Brother Daniel . Come , I need you . BROTHER DANIEL ( surprised ) What 's happened ? PASTOR WYLIE I do n't know . I came into the side door of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to investigate and this is what I found . BROTHER DANIEL I saw a man dart into the alley there at the corner just as I came up . He was wearing a sport shirt , dark trousers and a gray coat . PASTOR WYLIE Was he . . . ? BROTHER DANIEL Oh , he was a white man . We 'd better call the police . PASTOR WYLIE No time to call the police . We must find a piano now or it will be terribly embarrassing tonight . What will the Delfords think ? BROTHER DANIEL ( getting a broom and dust pan ) How can we ever explain ? PASTOR WYLIE ( going to the telephone ) Clean up as quickly as possible . I would n't want any of the Delfords to walk in and see this for anything . p. 37 BROTHER DANIEL ( looking at his watch ) It 's 5:15 . All the stores are closing now . PASTOR WYLIE ( dialing ; surprised ) Five-fifteen ? But I must have a piano from somewhere . Hello , Mr. Boswell , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big program here tonight , and there 's been a case of vandalism . Our piano has been torn to pieces . Can you send us one . . . Oh , right now . . . No . . . . BROTHER DANIEL Closed ! PASTOR WYLIE Yes . . . now , let 's see . Brother Daniel , get your car and go to the Larensky School of Music . Take my card ( giving him a card ) . . . Tell Professor Larensky that we 've had a case of vandalism here and I need a piano tonight . BROTHER DANIEL Of course . I pray that we get it . ( he exits ) ( Pastor Wylie walks the floor near the altar in a prayerful manner . . . Kneels at the altar with his back to the front entrance . Brother Jeremy enters from down-stage carrying a package of papers which are the programs for the concert . . . He sees Pastor Wylie kneeling . . . He walks silently toward the piano . . . then to the table where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notices Brother Jeremy at the table ) Oh , Brother Jeremy , I sent for you . Did you get my message ? p. 38 BROTHER JEREMY ( unconcernedly ) Yes , I did , but I had to go to the shop to get these programs because my delivery boys were all too busy . PASTOR WYLIE ( going to the piano ) Look . Look what we have on our hands . BROTHER JEREMY What happened ? ( very astonished ) PASTOR WYLIE I do n't know , why did it happen at this time ? When I came in my study about an hour ago , I found that the flowers on the altar had been strewn across the floor and the keys on the piano ripped off . BROTHER JEREMY About what time ? PASTOR WYLIE About five-fifteen . BROTHER JEREMY Did you call the police ? PASTOR WYLIE No . . . I do n't want the Delfords to find out . It 's a disgrace upon our parish ! I hope I can get a piano before they find out about it . BROTHER JEREMY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano at this hour ? PASTOR WYLIE I do n't know . . . but I believe . . . I believe God will send us one . BROTHER JEREMY It 's too late . . . everything is closed . p. 39 PASTOR WYLIE Brother Daniel has been here and I 've sent him out to find one . BROTHER JEREMY ( looking at the piano ) Quite a brutal job . . . I wonder who did it . PASTOR WYLIE Brother Daniel said that as he came in , he saw a white man run into the alley there at the corner of the church . BROTHER JEREMY A white man . . . eh ? ( examining the piano and then turning to Pastor Wylie ) Now . . . you have it . . . I believe it was some of those folk from Holy Star . . . perhaps it was done in order to humiliate the Delfords for casting their lot with us . PASTOR WYLIE Perhaps not . BROTHER JEREMY Who knows but that Jack Russell had it done in order to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order of things . PASTOR WYLIE Oh well , Elder Cohart told me that he received all kinds of threats when the Negro family joined his church . He said he never dreamed that Holy Star could be so shaken because of an addition of colored members , and certain members of his official board caused it all . BROTHER JEREMY It 's sabotage . . . that 's what it is . . . she should have had Sarah to play for her anyway . p. 40 PASTOR WYLIE ( defendingly ) Oh , that does n't matter . Judith had a right to select her own pianist . BROTHER JEREMY ( sharply ) She ignored Sarah ! ( looking at the piano ) A thousand dollar piano destroyed because of the Delfords . ( Pastor Wylie looks at him with interest ) The next thing we know , the church building will be bombed ! PASTOR WYLIE ( firmly ) Let it be ! Then the people who are asleep to Christianity will wake up . . . . Push the piano back and make way for the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin pulling the piano back ) CURTAIN p. 41 Act 2 , Scene 2 Place . Home of the Delfords , living room JUDITH DELFORD ( on settee asleep . Aunt Betsy is seen in another room knitting . Judith screams . ) Run ! Run , Aunt Betsy . . . the house . ( Aunt Betsy jumps up dropping her knitting , shakes herself and hoists her skirt . ) The house ! Run ! AUNT BETSY What is it , Judith ? Where ? Where ? JUDITH DELFORD ( sitting up on settee . ) There they go ! Look . . . look ! Go to the basement . . . lie down ! Keep your face to the ground . Be sure to hide your face . AUNT BETSY ( amazed , quietly ) She 's dreaming . . . Judith . . . Judith . JUDITH DELFORD ( excited . . . and leaping off the settee ) Oh . . . Aunt Betsy . . . I was dreaming . It was a horrid dream ! AUNT BETSY Yes , at first I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I was getting out of the way . JUDITH DELFORD ( seriously ) I thought I stood on the roof of Greenwood Church and there on the top of the house next door appeared a man in a long white robe , wearing a gray beard and long white hair . I thought he was John the Revelator . As he approached me , he raised his arms and said : ( raising her arms and speaking in an oratorical manner ) " I have come to show you the things which must shortly come to pass . Blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy for the time is at hand . " When he dropped his arms , the chimes on the clock rang out 5:15 , and the cities of every country in the world were filled with some kind of tangible evil , and this evil began to permeate the churches and grew until it became a mass of heat energy and in the east stood a four-footed beast holding a ball of this heat , and in the west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that four-footed beast threw his ball at the man in the west and the ball which the man held exploded . Then , I thought Atomic Circles of heat went twirling through the air . They traveled at such a rapid rate of speed that they took on a metal-like brilliancy which the man called flanderays . These flanderays became so numerous that they lost their individual identity and could no longer be seen , but could be felt as . . . as . . . heat waves . And people were suffering in the intense heat . . . The atmosphere got hotter and hotter . . . It became so hot that the earth lost its four seasons of the year and had only one  --  just summer . . . . Then the flanderays moved upward toward the sky and they reached the magnetic field of the sun . . . and . . . there appeared a spot on the sun ! ( shudders ) And . . . oh . . . explosions ! The explosions on other planets could be heard and felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosions set up more atomic fission and the earth became so hot that the sea , the oceans , and the rivers were dehydrated . . . Water was nowhere to be found . . . . p. 42 AUNT BETSY ( consolingly ) That was some dream , Judith . JUDITH DELFORD But that is n't all , Aunt Betsy. ( brushing back her hair ) The earth became filled with a thick haze which looked like red , purple , and yellow vapor . . . and black smoke ! . . . And . . . SCREAMS . . . screams of man could be heard as he ran to and fro seeking a place to hide himself ! . . . The moon was completely melted ! . . . Then , suddenly , the haze disappeared . . . but civilization had also disappeared and Greenwood Church , Holy Star and all buildings around were just dust . . . . Then , a cave was shown unto me and in this cave lived the remnants of all men of the earth . Men of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . There was one world , one people and one church and that church was being conducted in a cave . . . . Then this man raised his arms again and stepped gracefully out in space and said , " Greenwood Church is responsible for this calamity . Will the church permit hate to take mankind back to the cave ? . . . " ( pause ) Is n't that strange ? AUNT BETSY That was truly a vision , Judith . . . a vision . JUDITH DELFORD ( looking at her watch ) Oh , it 's six o'clock . By the time I eat and get dressed , it will be time for the concert . p. 43 AUNT BETSY ( emphatically ) Yes , and be sure you 're careful about the dress . JUDITH DELFORD What dress ? AUNT BETSY That dress you rented ! JUDITH DELFORD Oh . . . yes . . . of course . CURTAIN p. 44 Act 2 , Scene 3 Place : Home of the Jeremys , living room . ( Sarah Kirkwood is getting dressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . ) BROTHER JEREMY ( unlocks the front door and walks in , taking off his hat and coat . ) Hi , Sarah . SARAH KIRKWOOD Hello . . . well . . . is that concert over ? BROTHER JEREMY Ha ! . . . yes , it 's history now . SARAH KIRKWOOD What was it like ? BROTHER JEREMY ( flopping himself down in an armchair ) Ha ! ha ! ha ! SARAH KIRKWOOD What happened ? BROTHER JEREMY Somebody stole that three hundred dollar dress . SARAH KIRKWOOD ( pleasantly surprised ) What ? What did Judith do ? BROTHER JEREMY ( shrugging his shoulders ) Well . . . she went on without it ; but it took some of the enthusiasm out of her . The place was packed , though . I 've got to admit that ! SARAH KIRKWOOD Was Jack Russell her accompanist ? p. 45 BROTHER JEREMY Yes . . . but she might as well have used you . He could do no better . . . . But , listen , somebody intended to give her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? BROTHER JEREMY ( scornfully ) Ha ! ha ! . . . somebody entered the church about five o'clock and destroyed the flowers on the altar and tore up that thousand dollar piano . SARAH KIRKWOOD ( surprised ) No ! How horrible ! BROTHER JEREMY Maybe this will teach Pastor Wylie a lesson . . . and not only that , when Judith sang her first group of selections it was discovered that the sound system was not working . Her voice did n't carry . SARAH KIRKWOOD How did she correct that ? BROTHER JEREMY She called for Frank . He 's a radio technician . He found that the microphone had had a blow and the wire leading to the amplifier had been cut ! Frank repaired it and it did n't take that guy but just a minute ! Nobody even knew she was having trouble with the sound system . SARAH KIRKWOOD ( cautiously ) Oh , by the way , where is Luellen ? BROTHER JEREMY She went to the reception with them . ( slowly ) I do n't . . . know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them and I ca n't afford to say one thing against those people in her presence . She does n't know just yet how I feel about ' em . p. 46 SARAH KIRKWOOD ( quietly ) I really believe Frank is in love with Luellen . BROTHER JEREMY Do n't say such things , Sarah . I . . . believe it and yet . . . I do n't want to believe it . . . ( taking a cigarette ) I 'd rather see her dead than married to a white man . SARAH KIRKWOOD Jeremy ! After all , she is your only child . . . worse things have happened . BROTHER JEREMY Yes , but I 'd rather see anything happen to her than to see her become a Mrs. Delford . If her mother were living , I believe she would feel the same as I do about it . SARAH KIRKWOOD But . . . getting back to the concert . What were some of her selections ? BROTHER JEREMY ( laughs scornfully ) Ha , ha . . . ha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . . . ha , ha . SARAH KIRKWOOD ( smiles bewilderedly , as she looks on ) What 's so funny ? BROTHER JEREMY ( goes to his topcoat and pulls out a program ) Look ! ( Sarah draws near and looks on. ) p. 47 SARAH KIRKWOOD ( loudly ) Chopin ! Spelling Show-pan . . . ha , ha , ha , ha ! Did n't she know any better ? BROTHER JEREMY Of course she did , but I printed the program . I was at a distance when she picked up the program and looked on . She did n't know I was watching . SARAH KIRKWOOD What did she do ? BROTHER JEREMY ( jovially ) She turned as pale as the moon ! Then she stared with her little gray eyes . Ha , ha , ha ! . . . Then she turned as red as an apple . SARAH KIRKWOOD Then . . . nothing could be done about that . . . umph ? BROTHER JEREMY Well . . . Brother Daniel . . . what a fool ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no fault of the artist , that it was simply an error made by the printer . . . . SARAH KIRKWOOD Well . . . are n't you on the spot ? BROTHER JEREMY ( quickly ) I wonder if they 're home . Let 's see . . . Call and find out . SARAH KIRKWOOD ( dials the telephone ) Hello , Judith . . . Brother Jeremy was just telling me that your concert was swell ! . . . I 'm so glad for you . . . Oh , Luellen is over there ? ( Sarah and Jeremy look at each other ) Well . . . Brother Jeremy would like to speak with you . p. 48 BROTHER JEREMY Hello , Little Queen . . . you were grand tonight . Many congratulations ! I want to apologize for that error which appeared on the program . I know who handled your work at the shop and that person is going to get fired . . . Miss Delford , that could n't have been an error ! It 's too obvious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have some people there just like some of those at Holy Star . I know it wo n't help the situation now , but it 's my business to see that it does n't happen again . . . I shall ! . . . yes . . . sleep well tonight . Oh . . . send my daughter home . . . . ( he laughs ) Good night . ( hangs up ) SARAH KIRKWOOD How did she feel about it ? BROTHER JEREMY Oh , she 's all right now . She does n't believe it 's my fault . ( they laugh ) Oh , yes . . . Sarah . . . After the concert Pastor Wylie came to me and said that next Sunday he wants an offering taken to pay for that dress that was stolen . SARAH KIRKWOOD He did ! BROTHER JEREMY The people should not be taxed to pay for her carelessness . SARAH KIRKWOOD ( angrily ) Certainly not ! I 'm not going to give anything to the collection . They claim she 's giving all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling what kind of deal she and Pastor Wylie are trying to work over . p. 49 BROTHER JEREMY That 's true . . . I counted the money myself tonight and it 's been turned over to the church 's treasurer . SARAH KIRKWOOD How much ? BROTHER JEREMY **26;158;TOOLONG , ninety-four dollars and seventy-five cents . SARAH KIRKWOOD ( disappointed ) Well . . . it was a success . But losing the dress was her fault , so let her pay for it . . . . And just why is Pastor Wylie so interested in paying for that dress ? BROTHER JEREMY Ha ! ha ! ha ! . . . that 's what I want to know ! . . . I 'm the one who does the counting of the money and if he takes a collection , I 'll see to it that she does n't get all of it . . . I 'll put it in the church 's treasury and let it stay there . . . pay the church 's bills with it . ( they laugh scornfully ) SARAH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cap ) I have to go now . I am due at the home at 12:30 tonight . By the way , see that the church gets an X-ray instrument for the home . It 's needed . . . Dr. Granison wants one there real bad ! ( closing the door as she goes out ) BROTHER JEREMY All right , Sarah . ( a pause , Luellen enters excitedly ) p. 50 LUELLEN Oh , dad . Aunty Betsy is terribly sick . We thought she was asleep and Frank spoke of the dress having been stolen and she heard it , so she had one of those spells . BROTHER JEREMY Did they send for the doctor ? LUELLEN Oh , yes ! Dr. Granison ! BROTHER JEREMY ( slowly ) What did he say ? LUELLEN He . . . thinks that . . . she 's serious this time . . . . In fact , he asked that she be taken to the home where he can see her often and where Sarah can help look after her . BROTHER JEREMY ( slowly ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . . . oh . . . I 'm so sorry for Judith . . . . All of this trouble . BROTHER JEREMY ( slowly ) Most unfortunate . How did you get home , Luellen ? LUELLEN Frank brought me ! He 's so much disturbed , too . . . . They all love Aunt Betsy so . . . . ( Jeremy looks uneasy ) And Frank . . . I think he 's just swell ! BROTHER JEREMY Why tell that to me ? ( Luellen looks surprised . Jeremy walks into another room and slams the door behind him . Luellen stands speechless . ) CURTAIN p. 51 Act 2 , Scene 4 ( A bedroom and pastor 's study with a transparent screen wall to show that the two are connected . On the left is the pastor 's study with a door labeled PASTOR 'S STUDY in the screen wall . At the right of the bedroom of the convalescent home , where Aunt Betsy lies ill , is another door , in front of which is a folding screen which obscures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up-stage right is a window overlooking the street ; the door on the same side is an entrance from the street . There is also a folding screen at the entrance to the pastor 's study . ) SARAH KIRKWOOD ( in her uniform , looking out of the window ; she sees someone coming and goes to the door , in front of which the folding screen stands , and opens it . ) How are you , Brother Daniel ? Come in . BROTHER DANIEL ( steps just inside and pauses at the door ) I 'm fine . How 's the nurse , and Aunt Betsy ? SARAH KIRKWOOD Well , she 's quite ill . BROTHER DANIEL Too bad she heard that conversation about that stolen dress . SARAH KIRKWOOD Yes , Judith should n't have been so careless . Brother Jeremy tells me that Pastor Wylie plans to take an offering to pay for the dress , but I 'll not give anything . p. 52 BROTHER DANIEL Well now , Sister Kirkwood  --  Pastor Wylie wants to do what is right . Think of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a three hundred dollar dress . Do n't you think that the church should pay for that dress ? After all , she was good enough to donate all of the proceeds to Greenwood when she should 've been getting at least half of it ! Shall we be so narrow as not to want to pay for the dress ? SARAH KIRKWOOD That 's her responsibility ! Nobody asked her to give it all to the church ! She did it on her own volition ! BROTHER DANIEL ( frowning ) Sarah Kirkwood ! . . . Miss Delford should have the refund and more besides ! Just imagine what those people would say about this famous Greenwood Church . They 'd think that we 're either narrow , cheap exploiters or . . . that we are a people who can not appreciate art , culture nor sincere Christian leadership ! They 'd be laughing at our ignorance ! SARAH KIRKWOOD She does n't need it ! She 's getting money as a television artist ! BROTHER DANIEL ( firmly and deliberately ) That is not the point ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of appreciation for her service , even if the dress had not been lost ! Do we pay people because they need , or because they worked ? Which ? ( there is silence ) You hate Miss Delford for two reasons . . . ( Sarah rolls her eyes ) First , because she 's white , and second because she has ability ! p. 53 SARAH KIRKWOOD ( angrily ) Give her your money ! She wo n't get mine ! If it were Luellen , I would n't mind . . . but they just got here ! ( Brother Daniel looks under his forehead at her ) Brother Jeremy says he is going to see to it that she does n't get any . . . . And the Reverend Felton Wylie . . . well , he 's going to find himself out if he keeps on ! ( a pause ) And furthermore , I do n't only hate Judith , I hate you ! BROTHER DANIEL ( laughing heartily ) Ha , ha , ha , ha . . . ha , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have much to reap ! ( shaking his finger at Sarah and leaving . ) I said , Much to reap . I 'll be back later to see Aunt Betsy . ( Sarah stares at him and whirls around and takes a seat in Aunt Betsy 's room . Aunt Betsy is in bed . Pastor Wylie walks in from his study and stands behind the screen where he can look on . Nurse Kirkwood is in the room with Aunt Betsy reading a paper . ) AUNT BETSY ( in a strained voice ) I want water . . . water . . . please . . . water . ( Sarah does not even look toward her ) I 'm too hot . . . water , please !

Dr. Granison looks on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( tenderly ) Do you want something , Aunt Betsy ? AUNT BETSY Water . . . water . . . ( Sarah brings a glass of water and Aunt Betsy tries to swallow it . ) DR . GRANISON ( going back to Pastor Wylie ) I want to see you , Sarah , when you finish . Put a hot pad on her feet and an ice cap on her head . SARAH KIRKWOOD Yes , Dr. Granison . DR . GRANISON ( to Pastor Wylie ) That is the second time today that she 's ignored Aunt Betsy 's call . PASTOR WYLIE ( bewilderedly ) I sometimes wonder if the Gospel is doing some of these folk any good at all . DR . GRANISON ( with a snort ) Not Sarah . . . This morning one of the members of the parish came in here to see Aunt Betsy . . . . PASTOR WYLIE Who ? DR . GRANISON Sister Cannon . Sarah talked to her about Aunt Betsy . . . and she came to my office and told me to watch Sarah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't need any white patients in this home , that there is not enough room . here for our own folk . p. 55 PASTOR WYLIE Who are our own folk ? DR . GRANISON That 's what I want to know . I knew you would n't like such an attitude and I felt that you should know it . PASTOR WYLIE Did Aunt Betsy hear it ? DR . GRANISON It seems she said it for Aunt Betsy to hear , according to Sister Cannon . PASTOR WYLIE Have you spoken to Nurse Kirkwood about it ? DR . GRANISON Not yet , I 'll get her now in a few minutes . PASTOR WYLIE Well , I 'll wait . . . . Do it in my presence . ( Pastor Wylie walks a few steps to his study as Dr. Granison calls to Nurse Kirkwood ) DR . GRANISON Nurse Kirkwood . SARAH KIRKWOOD Yes , Dr. Granison . DR . GRANISON I 'd like to see you in the pastor 's office . SARAH KIRKWOOD ( irritably ) Yes , as soon as I finish here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice cap to her head ) Put your arms down ! ( Dr. Granison goes to Pastor Wylie 's study ) p. 56 DR . GRANISON Pastor Wylie , she is filled with evil ! As Chairman of the Executive Committee on the maintenance of this Convalescent Home , I recommend that she be dismissed . PASTOR WYLIE All in good time . Oh , what do you think about Aunt Betsy ? Will she recover ? DR . GRANISON ( slowly ) I can tell you as her pastor . I would not give this information to anyone else other than the family . . . No , I do n't think she 'll make it this time . . . unless there is a miracle . . . She had a better chance this morning but Sarah was negligent and her best opportunity slipped by . ( Pastor Wylie drops his head . Sarah approaches ) DR . GRANISON ( sternly ) Miss Kirkwood , Pastor Wylie and I stood by and watched your action towards Aunt Betsy when she asked you for water . Why did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KIRKWOOD Oh . . . I . . . did n't hear her ask for water . PASTOR WYLIE Sister Kirkwood , I stood there by the door and saw you reading the newspaper while she asked for water . DR . GRANISON Why would you not want to make Aunt Betsy comfortable ? Would you want anyone to treat you like that ? p. 57 SARAH KIRKWOOD ( indignantly ) I have n't done anything ! PASTOR WYLIE Sister Kirkwood , remember you are in the church . God is not pleased at what you said . SARAH KIRKWOOD ( indignantly ) Why do n't you take her to some other place ? We need that space ! PASTOR WYLIE That 's up to the church . DR . GRANISON ( interrupting angrily ) Sarah ! You do n't want her here because of her color . That 's all . Tell me this , what color is pain ? SARAH KIRKWOOD Pain ? DR . GRANISON Yes . . . Pain . . . pain . . . P-A-I-N ! Pain . . . What color is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What color is trouble ? SARAH KIRKWOOD Trouble has no color . DR . GRANISON ( slumping in his chair and putting his foot on the top of the desk ) Um . . . hum . . . ! PASTOR WYLIE But , apparently you thought so according to your attitude toward Aunt Betsy. p. 58 SARAH KIRKWOOD ( angrily ) I said that I have n't done anything to Aunt Betsy . DR . GRANISON Nurse Kirkwood , did you know that this home is owned and operated by church folk . . . and that we accept graciously any patient in here irrespective of color . . . that this being a Christian institution , we can not tolerate any racial prejudice in here ? SARAH KIRKWOOD ( firmly ) I have not mistreated Aunt Betsy . PASTOR WYLIE ( firmly ) But . . . you did . . . . I saw some of it myself . . . . DR . GRANISON And Sarah , I want you to know that I am the Chairman of the Executive Committee here and as such have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . SARAH KIRKWOOD ( boldly ) Let all of the Delfords go back where they came from . The quicker they go , the better I 'll like it . I was here before they came and before you came , Dr. Granison . PASTOR WYLIE Sister Kirkwood , I am surprised . DR . GRANISON You are ill , desperately ill . SARAH KIRKWOOD I 'm not ill , there 's not a thing wrong with me. p. 59 DR . GRANISON ( rising and leaving the office ) You are suffering from a case of hatetritis and it has set up spiritual thrombosis . ( in a low , but firm voice ) Get your hat and go ! PASTOR WYLIE ( quietly ) I endorse Dr. Granison 's action . You are no longer a nurse in this home .

GRANISON ( hurriedly ) Come quickly , Pastor Wylie. . . . ( a pause ) ( Sarah suddenly twirls herself around and hurriedly gets her cape and walks out as Pastor Wylie hurries to Dr. Granison . Dr. Granison and Pastor Wylie both rush to Aunt Betsy 's bedside . ) DR . GRANISON ( feeling her pulse and examining her heart beat ) You 'd better call her family . . . .

AUNT BETSY ( looking from one side of the bed to the other . Enter Pastor Wylie ; the atmosphere is tense . Aunt Betsy reaches under her pillow for a little Bible . ) Judith . . . I 'm going away . . . keep this Bible . . . You are sowing good seeds . . . but remember this . . . It is not always what you are sowing that makes you wring your hands and cry . Your seeds may be good seeds , but there could be sharp rocks on the ground and they might cut your feet as you sow . Rocks do not only choke the seeds , they choke you .

FLORENCE DELFORD It has been five months now since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but . . . let 's not talk about it . ( a pause ) I think when I finish my special events for the year , I 'll ask Pastor Wylie to send me to some foreign land as a missionary . FLORENCE DELFORD Can you do a greater work there ? JUDITH DELFORD Well , I would reach more people . FLORENCE DELFORD ( thinking ) Oh , what is the next feature for the special events of the year ? JUDITH DELFORD The Biblical drama is the next on the program , and I think it will be interesting . By the way , I did n't tell you that I have already begun writing the play . FLORENCE DELFORD What is the title ? p. 63 JUDITH DELFORD Reaping Where You Did Not Sow . FLORENCE DELFORD ( thinking ) How can one reap where he did not sow ? JUDITH DELFORD ( moving about the room like a professor ) There 're many ways of reaping where you did not sow . Sometimes we reap what our parents sowed , our grandparents , great-grandpar-@@ents , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand ) If they have sown misery , not only do they sometimes reap misery , but so do their children , their children 's children and so on . If you sow peace , you 'll reap peace . . . but if you do not sow at all while neighbors around you are sowing different kinds of seeds , you might have to reap some of those seeds that your neighbors sowed . In other words , the church is not supposed to be neutral . It is supposed to take a stand for that which is right and sow good seeds . . . Why . . . if all the neighbors around you sowed tares and you did n't sow any wheat , you might have to help to reap the tares which your neighbors sowed . Hence , you 'd be reaping where you did not sow . . . reaping because you did n't sow . FLORENCE DELFORD ( looking in space ) Yes . . . I . . . see .

I 've almost forgotten . ( curtains to hide Judith and Florence ) JUDITH DELFORD ( is not seen , only her voice is heard , neither is Florence seen ) You remember Christ said " A certain nobleman went into a far country . He called his own servants and delivered unto them his goods . Unto one he gave five talents ; to another , two ; and to another , one . " The play will show this parable . CURTAIN p. 65 Act 3 , Scene 2 ( Curtains open to show the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Daniel and Sarah in action . ) THE PLAY : " REAPING WHERE YOU DID NOT SOW " ( All players are in oriental costumes with Jeremy wearing the garb of a nobleman or king ) BROTHER JEREMY ( on a throne ) Come hither , all of you my servants .

FRANK DELFORD Five . SARAH KIRKWOOD He gave me two . BROTHER DANIEL ( angrily ) He gave me only one !

" He buries it and walks away looking back at the spot as he exits and while Judith speaks ) p. 68 JUDITH DELFORD ( voice only ) The servant to whom he gave the one talent buried it while the others bought and sold , planted and reaped a harvest . ( Frank has a sickle and is reaping while Sarah comes in behind him gleaning . While Frank and Sarah are in action , the voice of Judith is heard again . ) JUDITH DELFORD When they were sowing , all of their seeds did not fall into good ground . Some fell by the wayside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on stony ground where they had no depth and when the sun was up , they were scorched ; and some fell among thorns and the thorns choked them ; but others fell into good ground and brought forth a hundredfold .

Thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not , and gathered where I have not sown , thou oughtest , therefore , to have put my money in the bank and then at my coming , I should have received mine own interest !

JUDITH DELFORD Frank really seems to be in love with Luellen ! p. 72 FLORENCE DELFORD Judith . . . do . . . you think that you 'd like to have a Negro girl for a sister-in-law ?

( Sarah does not answer ) BROTHER JEREMY You 're a little early . ( Sarah takes Brother Daniel 's hat ) BROTHER DANIEL ( looks at his watch ) Yes . . . I did n't know I was so early .

BROTHER DANIEL Pastor Wylie has n't arrived yet ? BROTHER JEREMY No , you 're somewhat early ; he 'll be in after a little while . Preachers are always late . BROTHER DANIEL Well , we make ' em late . Every time they meet one of us , they have to stop . . . . They dare not rush away from us or we will accuse them of not wanting to speak to us. p. 74 BROTHER JEREMY You certainly find excuses for them , do n't you ? BROTHER DANIEL ( laughs ) Has he told you anything pertaining to the nature of this meeting tonight ? BROTHER JEREMY Yes , he wants to discuss this problem of the thief around the church and to see what can be done to stop this tampering with the Delfords around there . BROTHER DANIEL Too bad about Frank 's coat . BROTHER JEREMY Yes , someone really slit it up while he was on the stage . BROTHER DANIEL When did he first discover that his coat had been cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the stage . BROTHER DANIEL We both were backstage at that time , were n't we ? BROTHER JEREMY I went to get a drink of water , my throat was so dry and knowing that I had to do much talking in the next scene . . . I just stepped out into the hall to the fountain and was back in a minute . BROTHER DANIEL I was helping Miss Delford with stage property . ( a pause ) It seems to me that . . . someone passed through there at that time . p. 75 BROTHER JEREMY I suppose Pastor Wylie has the subject on the agenda for tonight . ( enter Luellen dressed in an after-five dress . Frank is with her . . . stopping first inside of the door ) LUELLEN Gentlemen ! . . . How has the day been ?

Luellen pretends to be unaware of her father 's attitude ) Brother Daniel , do you believe in healing ? ( Jeremy continues to stare ) p. 76 BROTHER DANIEL Healing ? LUELLEN Yes , divine healing ? BROTHER DANIEL ( slowly ) Well . . . I believe  --  it is possible . LUELLEN I was talking with Mrs. Conway today . You remember that she was very ill about three months ago . BROTHER JEREMY Yes . LUELLEN She told me that she was healed after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised ) Does she think Pastor Wylie did it ? LUELLEN She says she is certain it was Pastor Wylie who healed her . ( Brother Jeremy laughs ) BROTHER DANIEL It 's not the first time I 've heard that of him . . . . Of course , he never says anything about himself . LUELLEN That 's it ! He is the most humble person I ever met . . . so deeply consecrated . ( again Jeremy 's eyes are set on her ) BROTHER DANIEL I know a lady who had a goitre . He prayed with her . . . just put his hands on her head and prayed . . . and she said that after a day or two it began to diminish and within about four months , it had gone away completely . p. 77 LUELLEN But , Pastor Wylie never says a word about these things !

PASTOR WYLIE ( to Luellen ) Are you carrying on my meeting ? LUELLEN ( smiling ) Oh , no , but we were discussing something which I would like you to explain to me before you start the meeting . PASTOR WYLIE And what is that , my child ? LUELLEN Do you believe in healing ? PASTOR WYLIE ( slowly , seriously ) Yes . . . I . . . I believe that the same kind of miracles can take place today as in the days of Jesus . LUELLEN Why are n't they done today ? PASTOR WYLIE My child , there are four factors which must control a healing process . If any one of these four is left out , healing can not take place . p. 78 BROTHER DANIEL And what are they ? PASTOR WYLIE First , one must believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is able and willing to forgive sin ; secondly , have faith enough in Him to give yourself wholly to Him ; third , be willing to abide in Him and let his word abide in you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LUELLEN Then , why is it the modern Christian Church does not practice healing as did the primitive Christian Church ? PASTOR WYLIE The members of the early church did not know so much about the science of medicine . Consequently , they had to rely completely upon the power of God , as was manifested through the apostles who had seen Christ in person . . . . But today , we think first of a doctor and medicine . . . . But a doctor can only prescribe medicine . . . . God still does the healing . . . . And even today , we find sick people whose hope is not in the doctor , but in Jesus Christ , being miraculously healed ! BROTHER JEREMY Will the time come when there will be much healing again in the church ? PASTOR WYLIE Well . . . there might come a day when science will destroy the world and there might not be many hospitals or physicians . If so , Jesus Christ will have another chance to show more vividly his healing miracles . LUELLEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PASTOR WYLIE Well , Brethren , we must get started with our meeting . LUELLEN ( leaving the room ) I 'd like to hear more about this later . PASTOR WYLIE ( as Brother Jeremy gets his record books in readiness for the meeting ) Certainly , Miss Jeremy . . . . Be glad to . ( a pause ) Now , Brethren , you know what happened last Thursday night at the play . . . a very embarrassing thing . . . Frank Delford 's coat was slit in the dressing room while he acted on the stage . I suppose as God would have it , one of the girls discovered it before Frank did and came immediately to me and upon examining it , I found this note which someone had scribbled and put in his pocket . ( Brother Daniel reaches for the note ) It proves that some of our people are trying to drive them away . . . . ( with a sigh ) This is heavy on my heart ! BROTHER DANIEL ( reading ) " You are not wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you do n't , you 'll wish that you had . " ( a pause , they look at each other . Sarah shows herself in the next room as though she were listening to the reading of the note ) p. 80 PASTOR WYLIE ( taking another note from his pocket and passing it to Brother Daniel ) This one was sent to me through the mail . BROTHER DANIEL ( reading the note ) " Do n't think you 're at Greenwood Church to stay . You are not the only preacher . Put these folk out ; and as for you . . . you have ten days to get out of town . " ( looking for the signature as Sarah walks in boldly ) No name on it . SARAH KIRKWOOD ( to Pastor Wylie ) It serves you right . . . remember , you put me out of the convalescent home ! BROTHER DANIEL ( reprimanding ) Sister Kirkwood ! You are talking to your pastor and my pastor ! SARAH KIRKWOOD ( angrily ) You 're reaping what you did to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! SARAH KIRKWOOD ( continues ) So in love with the Delfords . . . BROTHER DANIEL ( rising to his feet as Pastor Wylie eyes Sarah ) Go back to your room , Sarah . You have no business out here interrupting this meeting . p. 81 BROTHER JEREMY ( sharply to Brother Daniel ) This is my house . Sarah is a roomer in my house . Nobody tells anybody here what to do but me ! SARAH KIRKWOOD Let the chips fall where they will ! ( to Brother Daniel ) You 've always been a stooge ! BROTHER DANIEL ( sternly ) I resent that . ( rising and reaching for his hat as Brother Jeremy rises also ) PASTOR WYLIE ( leaps to his feet pleading ) Brethren ! Brethren , God forbid . . . ! BROTHER DANIEL ( sarcastically ) Sister Sarah , if that 's the way you feel about it , there is a question in my mind as to who did write . . . ( holding up the notes ) these notes . ( Sarah snatches for the notes but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daniel . Pastor Wylie throws his right hand to his forehead and then slowly slumps to the floor . Brother Daniel slips the notes in his shoe as attention is focused on the fallen Pastor Wylie ) Bring a pan of cold water , Sarah ! ( Sarah laughs as she stands over Pastor Wylie and looks on . Brother Jeremy appears disinterested as Brother Daniel works hard to revive Pastor Wylie who looks as though he were dead ) Bring the water ! Brother Jeremy , call Dr. Granison ! p. 82 SARAH KIRKWOOD Let the healer heal himself ! ( she laughs while Jeremy walks slowly toward the telephone . Brother Daniel notices Jeremy 's attitude ) BROTHER DANIEL Where 's the telephone ? . . . I 'll call the doctor . SARAH KIRKWOOD ( laughing , but going for the water ) It serves him right ! BROTHER DANIEL ( dialing the phone ) Not as right as you may think ! Beware . . . what you sow , you shall reap ! Hello , Dr. Granison ? Come to Brother Jeremy 's home at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has happened to Pastor Wylie . He fell down and has n't revived as yet . I do n't know what to do for him . Come quickly ! BROTHER JEREMY I guess it 's best not to touch him until the doctor comes . BROTHER DANIEL ( bathing the pastor 's face with a wet cloth which Sarah has brought ) But what shall we do until he arrives ? SARAH KIRKWOOD He 's reaping what he sowed to me . BROTHER DANIEL You remember what Aunt Betsy used to say ? . . . SARAH KIRKWOOD Do n't mention Aunt Betsy to me. p. 83 BROTHER DANIEL Well , this fits in here . . . ' t is not always what a man sows that makes such things happen . . . sometimes it is the thing that he meets as he sows . His seeds may be good seeds but he might get stung on the hand by a bumble bee or he might get bitten by a rattlesnake as he sows his seeds .

GRANISON ( looks at Jeremy with piercing eyes ) No , he just fainted . I think his heart 's good . He 'll be all right . ( Pastor Wylie begins to move his hands ) How do you feel , Uncle Felton ? PASTOR WYLIE ( muttering ) All right ! DR . GRANISON ( to Brother Daniel and Brother Jeremy ) Let 's take him up and lay him on the davenport . ( Jeremy is slow taking hold . Brother Daniel and Dr. Granison take hold of him but he begins raising himself up ) PASTOR WYLIE Take me to the Convalescent Home . DR . GRANISON Sure . . . you may go to the Convalescent Home . We 'll let you stay there a while , and then we 'll send you away . . . out of town for a good rest .

( they laugh ) BROTHER JEREMY That Daniel is so silly ! SARAH KIRKWOOD Too bad Frank did n't get that note . BROTHER JEREMY I wonder what the Rev. Mr. Wylie will do now that he 's asked to get out of town . SARAH KIRKWOOD Nothing . . . . He has n't sense enough to know danger when he sees it . ( Luellen enters stretching and rubbing her eyes ) SARAH KIRKWOOD Did you get a good nap ? LUELLEN Oh yes , what time is it ? ( Jeremy is eying her ) I have a date . BROTHER JEREMY Nine o'clock . . . . A date with whom ? LUELLEN Oh , daddy . You must n't ask those kinds of questions ! BROTHER JEREMY ( firmly ) Do you have a date with Frank Delford ?

BROTHER JEREMY They 're not your kind . LUELLEN What do you mean , not my kind ? BROTHER JEREMY Not your type . LUELLEN The Delfords are all highly intelligent . . . and . . . BROTHER JEREMY ( interrupting ) But they 're not your color . I just could n't stand seeing my daughter married to a man of another color . LUELLEN ( almost tearful , draws near to Jeremy ) Daddy . . . beware . . . lest you hate . BROTHER JEREMY Hate ? . . . you do n't know what you 're talking about . . . .

SARAH KIRKWOOD ( calmly ) Luellen . . . you 'd better listen to your father . LUELLEN ( firmly ) Sarah , to me the human heart is an earth , and love is a colorless seed . Once the seed is planted , it sprouts and grows naturally . ( Jeremy and Sarah look at each other ) SARAH KIRKWOOD Luellen , you 'd better get dressed if you 're going out . . . it 's 9:30 now .

SARAH KIRKWOOD What do you mean ? BROTHER JEREMY Whatever it takes . . . I can not see her going that way . The Rev. Mr. Wylie is to blame even for this . If he had not permitted them the membership she would never have had a chance to meet Frank . p. 87 SARAH KIRKWOOD I wonder if sister Cannon knows about his falling out here tonight . BROTHER JEREMY I do n't think so . Not unless Brother Daniel called her . Call her and tell her he 's gone nuts . ( they giggle ) SARAH KIRKWOOD I believe I will call her . She 's always been so crazy about him . ( she dials the telephone ) Hello , Rachael , have you heard the news ? . . . Your pastor collapsed here tonight and he 's at the convalescent home . . . .

No , Dr. Granison is going to send him away . . . he , yes . . . he took his shoes off and began hammering on the floor with the heels of his shoes . We had to hold him ! Well , we told you . . . now I suppose we can get another pastor . I . . .

( He proceeds to throw her property on the floor , she weeps bitterly while gathering them and placing them into suitcase and walks out . . . . ) LUELLEN ( pausing at the door ) Good-by , daddy . . . . I 'm going to Frank . BROTHER JEREMY Then you may never put your foot across this threshold again . ( he slams the door ) CURTAIN@@ ( Home of the Delfords ; living room with bedroom connected  --  a baby 's crib is seen in the bedroom . Luellen is standing over the crib . ) LUELLEN ( with a faint smile ) You are a little piece of heaven with two little stars for eyes . Stars . . . that beam and beam until they find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the future have met each other in you . ( solemnly with sighs ) A little love . . . a little sorrow , a little forgiving . . . but , oh . . . how hard it is to forget . . . . ( a faint audible laugh ) simply because there was a little hate , too . I hope that you 'll never be driven from home by your daddy just because you love someone , and have to go two years without even a phone call from your daddy . ( smiles ) Oh well . . . if only Aunt Betsy could have seen you . . . I know what she would say . . . . She would say : " What you do n't know , God can tell you ; what you do n't see , God can show you ; and what you do n't have , God can give you . " ( the door bell rings ) FLORENCE DELFORD ( in the distance ) I 'll get it , Luellen . LUELLEN All right , Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wylie . ( Florence goes to the door ) p. 91 LUELLEN ( fixing the blanket in the crib ) Sleep , my little darling , Daddy will be home soon . ( rushes to the door with Florence ) FLORENCE DELFORD ( to pastor Wylie ) Welcome , Pastor , welcome ! LUELLEN How glad we are to see you . PASTOR WYLIE ( enters the living room ) It 's good to be here . FLORENCE DELFORD ( smiling broadly and pointing to the crib ) And look what we have since you last visited ! LUELLEN It 's a boy ! PASTOR WYLIE And the name ? FLORENCE DELFORD It 's Junior , of course ! LUELLEN Frank Delford , Jr . FLORENCE DELFORD And his daddy is as proud as a peacock . ( all taking a seat in the living room ) PASTOR WYLIE When have you heard from Judith ? LUELLEN About a week ago , was n't it , Florence ? FLORENCE DELFORD Yes , I think so . . . and she did n't seem to be too happy . The Cold War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she is afraid she wo n't get back before a hot war breaks out . FLORENCE DELFORD But who would have thought that Judith would have been a missionary ? PASTOR WYLIE I did ! FLORENCE DELFORD You did ? PASTOR WYLIE Yes . . . . FLORENCE DELFORD I suppose you can see farther than we can , Pastor . PASTOR WYLIE She had told me several times of her ambition , but she feared that Aunt Betsy would not have wanted to see her go so far away . So after Aunt Betsy died ( looking at Luellen ) and I joined these children into wedlock , she seemed to feel free to go to Africa . . . . LUELLEN It 's been a year since she arrived there and the international situation is so serious that she might have to come back home . PASTOR WYLIE And it 's no short distance to Darkland . At least seven thousand miles . I have received letters from her since the church sent her away and all of her communications have sounded an ominous note . She stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about God . They do not want to be told about God by a person of her color . p. 93 LUELLEN ( shaking her head ) Oh , how sad ! PASTOR WYLIE She said that in many places she sees signs reading " Guna ter awana , " meaning " No white people allowed . " LUELLEN ( rising ) Please excuse me . . . . I must see about the baby ; and . . . I have a few little clothes to hang up , too . PASTOR WYLIE Go right on , my child . ( a pause ) FLORENCE DELFORD ( in a low voice ) She does n't like to hear anyone talk about the way colored peoples feel about white people since her father drove her away because she was in love with Frank . We do everything we can to make her happy , but she wants her father to accept Frank as a son-in-law and he just wo n't do it . PASTOR WYLIE He 'll get over it . FLORENCE DELFORD I do n't understand . . . he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would cause his loyalty to us to be in question until she and Frank married . Her father is really a good man ! He just does n't believe in mixed marriages . PASTOR WYLIE A lot of people do n't . And whoever would practice it should use much discretion and seek spiritual guidance , letting love be the basic principle involved in creating the union , just as Luellen and Frank have done . p. 94 FLORENCE DELFORD ( drawing her chair nearer and in a low voice ) And . . . he seems to blame you , too . . . . ( quickly ) You remember the night you became ill at his home ? PASTOR WYLIE ( a smile ) Yes . . . very well ! FLORENCE DELFORD Well . . . you remember it was about three months after that you went away for a rest ? PASTOR WYLIE Yes . FLORENCE DELFORD Well . . . He put out a rumor that you had cancer of the medula oblongata . That Dr. Granison was trying to get you into an out-of-town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that nobody would know . . . and Sarah helped to keep the rumor going ! ( Pastor Wylie is startled ) He had the whole church greatly disturbed ! And when you went away for a rest , ( showing signs of anger ) . . . ah ! . . . he just strutted around like a turkey . . . attempting to take all of the church 's business in his hands and telling the people that you would never be able to come back to them , because , because . . . you . . . you could n't . PASTOR WYLIE But I was communicating with him each week ! Not a single week passed in which I did not exercise my pastoral duties through the mails. p. 95 FLORENCE DELFORD You see , he did n't want the public to know that ; he wanted to kill your influence . Because you had done some such special things for our church , giving . . . large sums of your own money and the like . . . depleting your purse for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the Circle of Truth , wanted to send you a donation when you were ill ; but Brother Jeremy had us all confused and disturbed ! PASTOR WYLIE In what way were you confused ? FLORENCE DELFORD He told us that it is against the program of the church to send donations to the pastor or anyone . . . and that is the pastor 's own program . ( Pastor Wylie looks surprised ) Especially if such things are done by auxiliaries . . . . He said that the board takes care of those things and the pastor would n't like it if we sent him a donation ; in fact , he said that it would embarrass the pastor and his family to give them money . ( with a teenager 's giggle ) Money does n't embarrass me unless I ca n't get it ! PASTOR WYLIE ( with a faint smile ) Where did your sister go ? FLORENCE DELFORD To hang up the baby 's clothes . . . . ( drawing her chair nearer ) Pastor , I have something I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice and keeping a watchful eye for Luellen ) If she just does n't come in before I can finish . It is about a conversation which I overheard between her father ( nodding her head toward the door through which Luellen went ) and some man as we rode on the bus the other morning . . . . I found out that he does n't like us ! ( showing signs of anger ) He does n't want us in Greenwood . p. 96 PASTOR WYLIE ( disappointedly ) Oh . . . Maybe you think that he does n't ! FLORENCE DELFORD No , no ! He does not ! PASTOR WYLIE What makes you think so ? FLORENCE DELFORD ( drawing a little nearer and speaking in a gossipy , mimicry voice whenever quoting characters ) Because , when he got on the bus he sat right in front of me , beside a man whom he called Brother Beeman . PASTOR WYLIE Oh . . . I know Brother Beeman ! He used to live here . He moved to Summit Rock , Wyoming about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is an officer in the Church of the Holy Creation there and . . . PASTOR WYLIE ( interrupting ) Yes . I know about that church , too . It has about four thousand members , or maybe more . FLORENCE DELFORD ( tossing her head angrily ) Mr. Beeman said to Brother Jeremy " We have a white pastor , now . . . sent to us by the General Cherubin Board of Directors . . . We 've had him about two years now . Started his salary at two hundred dollars per month . " Then Brother Jeremy asked , " Is he a good preacher ? " Mr. Beeman answered , " Ah , yes ! Some pulpiteer ! Well prepared . . . a string of degrees . . . but we 're going to work him as cheap as we can . " And , then , he said , " Some of our silly members are already advocating a raise in his salary ; but we board members are going to keep that well under control . . . . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gets " ( Pastor Wylie nervously pulls at his collar ) Then , they both laughed . Finally , Brother Jeremy blabbed out , " We 've had a white family join our church . . . the Delfords . . . and we board members are making it hot for them , too . " p. 97 PASTOR WYLIE Did Brother Jeremy say that ? FLORENCE DELFORD Yes he did ! But he did n't tell him that Luellen had married Frank ! And let him tell it , you have never introduced a new idea at Greenwood . They had planned to have a mobile church before the Wright Brothers invented the airplane , and a convalescent home before New York had a skyscraper ! PASTOR WYLIE ( looking under his forehead at Florence ) Are you sure that was Brother Jeremy ? FLORENCE DELFORD Sure ! I could 've touched him . I felt like knocking his hat off his head ! ( There is silence as Pastor Wylie flashes his eyes across the room ) And furthermore , this Mr. Beeman said , with a grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board , we veteran board members take him out and school him ; when we finish with him he 's scared to be the pastor 's yes-man. We keep the people hoodwinked ; and those who persist in doing extra good deeds for him we call monkeys and flunkies . That limits his friends . " Then , he said , " We keep that white preacher under our fingers by selecting the most intelligent women of the church . . . . women whom we know to be anti-white preacher , ( Pastor Wylie frowns ) women who can use tact and strategy ; and whenever the pro-pastor members start any kind of courtesy movements in his interest , these women block the progress by diverting the attention to some needy parishioner. " p. 98 PASTOR WYLIE ( seriously ) We must remember the poor , you know ; pastors want that done . FLORENCE DELFORD I know , but why wait to do it when someone wants to remember the pastor ? Do pastors ever need friends ? Are they human beings ? Because Mr. Beeman 's pastor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his members or anywhere else he can find them . PASTOR WYLIE ( smiling ) That Mr. Beeman is a tough board member , is n't he ? FLORENCE DELFORD And yet not any tougher than your Brother Jeremy . . . Just wait a minute . ( Pastor Wylie rises to his feet and gives a little cough ) He is n't what you think he is . He 's not your friend ! PASTOR WYLIE ( looking at his watch ) Perhaps you do n't understand him . FLORENCE DELFORD You do n't understand him . . . . ( drawing nearer to Pastor Wylie ) Why , he said to Mr. Beeman , " They do n't have to be white for Greenwood 's board to do that ; we 've been using that strategy on Pastor Wylie all the time . . . . ( Pastor Wylie 's face is flushed ; he moves toward his hat on the table ; Florence follows closely touching him on the arm at intervals ) work him and give him as little as possible . . . and keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . . . . Ha , ha , ha . . . . It works ! " ( Pastor Wylie stares and is speechless ) Are all board members like that , Pastor ? p. 99 PASTOR WYLIE Would you think they were like that ? FLORENCE DELFORD They were n't at Holy Star . . . . ( thinking ) . . . Maybe one that I heard Aunt Betsy talk about . . . well , probably another . . . ( quickly ) But we people at Holy Star knew the difference between envy of good , intelligent leadership and interest in the poorship ! The way they do it they are n't interested in the poor . PASTOR WYLIE ( smiling and rubbing his hands together ) Aunt Betsy ! . . . All pastors have trouble some time with board members standing between them and the people who really support God 's program . FLORENCE DELFORD That Mr. Beeman said , " Our pastor is trying to teach the members to tithe ; pretending that he wants to build a recreation center for young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop that , too . " Pastor , that 's what we young people want ; and Brother Jeremy knows that we do and yet , he said to Mr. Beeman , " We 're blocking it at Greenwood , too . If we let ' em get too much done they 'll feel themselves too important . . . and will expect a raise . " PASTOR WYLIE ( sarcastically ) That 's a good way to stop juvenile delinquency , is n't it ? p. 100 FLORENCE DELFORD ( disgustedly ) Yes . . . . Stop the Pastor ! . . . But you know what I 'd do if I were a pastor ? PASTOR WYLIE ( with a twinkle in his eye ) What would you do ? FLORENCE DELFORD I 'd quit putting men on the board and put a board on the men ! But the quicker the people learn to think for themselves , the better . I believe all churches have trouble with a few envious people ; but we at Holy Star never let one or two block the whole order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for being a good leader . If it belongs to him let him have it . PASTOR WYLIE ( smiling broadly ) Remember , Elder Cohart was forced to resign . . . . I 'd better put you on the board anyway . FLORENCE DELFORD You need some women on the board . That Brother Jeremy is a snake . I would n't have told you these things , Pastor ; but you need to know that man ! I can see why Judith had so much trouble . . . a sap head , a squeaky ! PASTOR WYLIE Oh no ! Do n't feel that way ! ( Luellen 's footsteps are heard ) FLORENCE DELFORD ( softly ) Here comes Luellen. p. 101 LUELLEN Pastor , I was just thinking of you before you came . PASTOR WYLIE What were you thinking ? FLORENCE DELFORD ( interrupting ) Sit down , Pastor . Do n't hurry ! LUELLEN I was thinking about how you befriended daddy when he first began his business . Remember ? PASTOR WYLIE ( smiling faintly ) Of course , I do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have finished my education . . . . It was an extra deed of kindness which you did n't have to do . FLORENCE DELFORD I imagine that the membership is filled with people whom you 've helped in various ways , is n't it , Pastor Wylie ? PASTOR WYLIE Yes ; but your pastor is not the only one who does such deeds . There is a heavy financial pull from the public upon all pastors , regardless of denomination , creed or color . ( looking at his watch ) I must be going now . Tell Brother Delford I 'm thinking of putting him on the Trustee Board this year ; I need him there . ( a pause ) Oh , yes , we must say a prayer before going . ( a pause ) p. 102 FLORENCE DELFORD Pastor Wylie , there is much talk around town of your being a healer . PASTOR WYLIE ( does not look up . . . slowly ) Really ? FLORENCE DELFORD Pastor , you never say anything about yourself . . . we want you to pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course I will . ( a pause ) LUELLEN Pastor , do you believe that there is going to be a war ? PASTOR WYLIE ( slowly ) Well . . . LUELLEN I hope not . . . . I hope Frank does n't have to experience another one . PASTOR WYLIE ( slowly ) The Christian Church in a Christian country must make itself felt in state affairs . The Christian Church must lead rather than follow in Christian principles . . . . A Christian country must practice brotherhood or be swallowed up by any kind of isms and strange doctrines . Unless the church takes the lead in this practice , then one might expect anything . I must be going now . . . . May we pray ? ( They all stand in silence as Pastor Wylie walks to the crib and puts his right hand therein . ) Amen . ( shaking hands ) May God bless you both . p. 103 FLORENCE DELFORD We 'll see you at church on Sunday . LUELLEN ( with a smile ) If Frank keeps the baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Luellen turn from the door . A pause , the telephone rings ) FLORENCE DELFORD Hello . . . yes . . . yes . . . this is Florence Delford. ( to Luellen ) This is long distance . LUELLEN Who ? . . . I wonder  --  FLORENCE DELFORD Hello . . . ( Surprised ) Hello ! Judith . . . where are you ? San Francisco ? When did you get into the states ? ( to Luellen ) She has just arrived . . . . ( Frank entering , looks amazed then he and Luellen caress each other at the telephone ) When will you arrive ? Thursday ? ( A roaring noise is heard as of the sound of planes . Frank rushes out to see what it is ) LUELLEN ( taking the receiver ) Oh , Judith , hurry home ! Yes ! Yes , ( a siren is heard ) I want you to see what a great nephew you . . . have . . . he . . . there 's something happening around here ! p. 104 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! . . . for shelter . . . go to the basement ! LUELLEN ( dropping the receiver , excitedly ) What is it , Frank ? FLORENCE DELFORD Attack ? Is it ? Is it ? FRANK DELFORD Go to the basement ! I 'll take the baby ! LUELLEN Attack ! Oh , God ! Help us ! FRANK DELFORD Run ! Run , Florence ! ( explosions ) FLORENCE DELFORD ( screaming as the stage darkens ) Oh . . . the baby ! LUELLEN My baby ! ( Luellen sobs and groans ) FRANK DELFORD Keep your face down , Luellen ! ( The roaring continues as the curtain closes. ) p. 105 Act 4 , Scene 2 ( The stage is lighted again ; the house is demolished except for one wall left standing . A canvas extends from the top of that one wall . They are in tattered clothing . Florence is cooking in battered pots on a wood fire on the ground . Brother Jeremy is sitting near by .

BROTHER JEREMY ( begins to sob and limps toward Luellen ) Here is your daddy . Your daddy does n't have a home now . ( he weeps . . . tremor is in his voice ) I had a house . . . . ( Luellen weeps , Frank appears filled with sorrow ) I thought it was mine forever ! ( Luellen feels for his hands ) p. 106 LUELLEN Take my hand , daddy ! BROTHER JEREMY Your father has no hands . The war took them away . LUELLEN Frank ? FRANK DELFORD Yes , dear . LUELLEN Is my daddy teasing me ? FRANK DELFORD No . . . he has no hands . LUELLEN ( tearfully ) And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobs ) and no baby . ( Judith is seen by Florence in the distance ) FLORENCE DELFORD ( excitedly ) Oh , here comes Judith ! ( Florence runs to meet Judith ) LUELLEN Judith ? . . . Who is Judith ? FRANK DELFORD Oh , my dear , you know Judith . LUELLEN ( trying to remember ) Judith . . . Judith . . . Judith . . . Judith . BROTHER JEREMY ( tearful ) Yes . . . Yes . . . Judith . . . ( he breaks down and sobs ) JUDITH DELFORD ( solemnly looks on ) Luellen ! ( kissing her cheeks ) p. 107 LUELLEN Oh , I know Judith . . . . That 's the girl who killed my baby ! ( in a rage ) Get out ! Get out ! Do n't come here ! You 're a foreigner . You ca n't have Frank . BROTHER JEREMY ( weeping ) Oh , my baby . . . . Lord , have mercy upon her ! ( he weeps bitterly ) JUDITH DELFORD ( in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? FLORENCE DELFORD The day that you called , Princeton was raided and something struck her on the head . It blinded her ! She 's a little unbalanced , too . . . . BROTHER JEREMY If God would only have mercy on us . JUDITH DELFORD ( taking hold of the nub arm of Jeremy ) I 'm praying for you ! ( he looks up at her as if he wanted to say something . Florence brings a crust of bread and a pan of food to each one ) JUDITH DELFORD ( feeding Brother Jeremy ) I thought of you so often while I was away . BROTHER JEREMY I do n't want any more food , I can not eat , my heart is heavy ! p. 108 JUDITH DELFORD I know ! FRANK DELFORD No doctors and no nurses . . . . It 's such a bare world ! FLORENCE DELFORD Oh . . . Judith , Greenwood Church was completely demolished ! JUDITH DELFORD Nowhere to worship , now ? FRANK DELFORD ( feeding Luellen ) Yes . . . a cave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all come together into one congregation and we have dug out a tunnel-like opening on the same spot where Greenwood Church was . We 're having services there tonight . ( Judith is thinking ) JUDITH DELFORD That reminds me , I 'll go to worship there tonight . Why not take more food , Brother Jeremy ? . . . ( Brother Jeremy looks uneasy , he is restless , he breaks down and sobs ) BROTHER JEREMY Judith . . . I 'm sorry ! JUDITH DELFORD Sorry about what ? ( Florence and Frank look with interest . Florence draws nearer ) BROTHER JEREMY For what I did to you ! LUELLEN It was n't you , daddy , it was Sarah ! BROTHER JEREMY It was I , but you did n't know it . ( to Judith in a trembling voice ) You remember the night of the concert ? p. 109 JUDITH DELFORD Yes . BROTHER JEREMY Someone stole your dress ? JUDITH DELFORD Yes . BROTHER JEREMY I did n't do it . . . but . . . I had it done ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Judith appears solemn ) LUELLEN No ! no , daddy ! BROTHER JEREMY You remember that the piano keys were ripped off . JUDITH DELFORD You did n't do that , did you ? BROTHER JEREMY Yes , I wore a false face and false hands to make myself look like a white man . . . . I scattered the flowers on the altar . ( Florence 's anger is rising ) I damaged the microphone . ( Florence rushes up to him and slaps his face . Frank grabs her . Luellen screams ) FRANK DELFORD Never strike a helpless man ! I saw enough of that at Iwo Jima ! BROTHER JEREMY I deserve it . This is what I sowed , but please have mercy on me . FLORENCE DELFORD ( struggling to release herself from Frank ) Who slit up Frank 's coat ? p. 110 BROTHER JEREMY I did n't do that . FLORENCE DELFORD ( angrily ) Who knows that you did n't ? You hoodlum ! You snake , you murderer ! ( Luellen weeps bitterly ; Frank releases Florence to comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeremy again , but Judith catches her just in time to keep her from striking him on the head ) JUDITH DELFORD Florence ! Be ashamed ! ( a pause ) FRANK DELFORD We 'll all go to church tonight . There will be a healing service and maybe God will bless your eyes , Luellen . JUDITH DELFORD And we 'll pray for you too , Florence , that your ill temper will be healed . Remember what Aunt Betsy used to tell you about that temper . FLORENCE DELFORD ( calming down ) I 'm sorry . . . so sorry . CURTAIN p. 111 Act 4 , Scene 3 ( The semi-dark cave has a sign over the arch-shaped entrance which reads " Greenwood Church . " Jeremy and Judith are seen walking side by side into the cave . Then Frank and Florence and Luellen . . . Brother Daniel , Pastor Wylie and Sarah . Sarah is paralyzed on one side . Her mouth is twisted and the lip pulled up as though she were burned . A crudely built altar is seen as they enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother Daniel and the Delfords and Sarah shake hands with Pastor Wylie . During the process of hand-shaking inside the cave , the sound of a plane is heard . All listen ; but instead of an air raid as they might have expected , they hear music in the air coming from a plane . It is a choir singing " The Ten Commandments . " 1 The Ten Commandments by the author of this play . After discovering that it is the Ten Commandments , they all rush back toward the entrance to listen . As they come to the entrance , they meet Dr. Granison . ) DR . GRANISON It 's a choir in a plane . . . . ( they all gaze into the air . A pause ) That is not an American plane . BROTHER DANIEL I wonder where they are from . ( they all push a little farther out into the open at which time a shower of leaflets come down ) p. 112 FRANK DELFORD ( seizing a leaflet and reading ) " The earth is the Lord 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leaflet ) " Be still and know that I am God . . . .

Whatsoever a man soweth , that shall . . . ( Pastor Wylie seizes a leaflet but does not read aloud ) he also reap . " ( The reading of the leaflets should have been timed so that the beginning of the climax of the song page nine of the score will be reached by the choir at the time Pastor Wylie seizes the leaflet which he holds in his hands until the song ends . In the distance , the humming of the climax dies away as Pastor Wylie reads the final leaflet ) PASTOR WYLIE ( reading and then leading the group back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind , and thy neighbor as thyself. . . .

PASTOR WYLIE Let everyone who has the love of God in his heart and feels that his heart is right with his fellow brother come forward and take a piece of this holy bread and break it with his brother while Brother Daniel leads us in a song . BROTHER DANIEL ( Rises singing as the group joins in . He goes to the altar first and breaks the bread in Pastor Wylie 's hand and then begins moving around breaking bread with the other members of the cast moving a little nearer to Brother Jeremy ) BROTHER JEREMY ( leaping up and hopping out from his seat interrupting the service ) Brother Pastor , I have something to say before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not break bread . ( breaking down in tears ) I have no hands . ( pointing his nub arm to Luellen ) There is my only child . . . blind . . . . ( there is a tenseness ) If I could but call back the day when Sister Judith had her concert in Greenwood Church . I would be loyal . There would be no stolen dresses . . . there would be no damaged pianos , there would be no coats cut up and no threatening notes . That , that I did n't do , I had it done . . . I thought that I was right . ( Sarah looks uneasy , Jeremy is weeping ) Pastor Wylie , I 've committed many sins against you . I persecuted you with tales that were not true . I put every obstacle that I could into your pathway . ( Pastor Wylie is weeping ) When you were in the hospital , the parishioners wanted to give you gifts of special offering , but I " muzzled the ox that treaded out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard that you are a healer . . . I laughed . . . but please , if such can be , will you have mercy on me and touch her . . . if you can only help her . . . . ( he weeps bitterly . Frank and Luellen are weeping ) The Lord have mercy on us ! p. 114 PASTOR WYLIE Come nearer , Brother Jeremy . SARAH KIRKWOOD ( rising ; her body is twisted and paralyzed ) I am guilty , too . I permitted myself to be used by Brother Jeremy . It was I who wrote the threatening note to you , Pastor Wylie . ( Sarah is weeping and speaking in a thick tongue which characterizes a paralytic ) It was I who suggested the pie on the eve of the concert , because I thought that it would hide our aim . Such people as we are unfit to be in God 's house . . . . So he suffered us to have to worship in a cave . We had beautiful homes and a beautiful church in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use them righteously .

GRANISON ( rushing up to her and looking ) Too bad we have nothing to work with now . We 'll have to depend upon the power of God to heal her . There are no places in which to purchase medicines . p. 115 PASTOR WYLIE Let us sing a song . ( Brother Daniel leads in singing . Pastor Wylie gazes upward as he kneels over her ; with one hand on her head he calls her ) Sarah ! SARAH KIRKWOOD Pastor . . . .

" p. 118 Act 4 , Scene 4 ( Before the curtain rises , the sound of a church bell is heard . A choir stands in readiness , robed , but in the open air . In the background is an unfinished wooden church . As the curtain rises , Luellen , who stands in the center of the group , steps forward as she takes the solo of the anthem : Alleluia , The Prince of Peace Shall Reign , by the author of this play . All members of the cast sing without music except Luellen , who sings from what appears to be a music manuscript copy. )                  @ @ @
