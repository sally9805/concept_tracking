This year 's Nobel Prize in physics ( worth $42,606 ) went last week to two professors of the University of California at Berkeley , Emilio Segre , 54 , and Owen Chamberlain , 39 . In 1955 they headed a team that found the long-sought antiprotons , key particles of the stranger-than-fiction world of antimatter ( TIME , Oct. 31 , 1955 et seq . ) . Antiprotons , which the Segre-Chamberlain team identified in a beam of subatomic debris created by Berkeley 's 6.2-billion-volt bevatron , have the mass of ordinary protons but carry negative electric charges instead of positive charges . When a proton hits an antiproton , they annihilate each other , both turning into a powerful flash of gamma-ray energy . <P> Dr. Chamberlain was born in San Francisco , is on leave this school season to lecture at Harvard . Dr. Segre , an associate of the great Enrico Fermi , was born in Tivoli , Italy . Like Fermi , he came to the U.S. before World War II because of disgust with Italian Fascism . Both he and Dr. Chamberlain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chamberlain helped explode the first test bomb at Alamogordo in 1945 . <P> Nobel Prize for chemistry went to Professor Jaroslav Heyrovsky , 68 , of Charles University , Prague , the first Czechoslovak to win a Nobel Prize . The award came as much-belated recognition for his discovery of polarography , a delicate electrical method of chemical analysis . It works by measuring the properties of ions , and can detect slight traces of metals in a drop or two of a complex solution . Discovered in 1925 , polarography is still used all over the world by analytical chemists .
