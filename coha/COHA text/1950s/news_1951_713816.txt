TWOMBLY.RUTH ... pg . 30 Comments on The following are representative of the many expressions of opinion voiced by writers of letters to THE TIMES : Policy of Fear Charged To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I cull from your editorial of May 6 upholding the Administration 's conduct of the war in Korea your reason for not supporting General 's proposals . You say that " it has not been made convincingly clear that extended air operations and a naval blockade of Communist China would materially shorten the war or reduce to any appreciable extent our grievous casualties . " Your insistence , in effect , that no measure proposed for ending the war should be adopted unless its success is assured in advance impresses me as symptomatic of a state of mind all too prevalent in our country and in the world at large . On this exigent issue of ending an ambiguous war we can not rationalize ; we can only feel . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of losing Hong Kong , so their Government tries to placate Red China by supplying her with munitions of war , which she in turn uses against the United Nations ' forces in Korea . The French are afraid that any decisive success by the United Nations in the Far East may bring Red Russia against them in Europe . Our Administration is afraid to end the Korean war , as it may readily do by stifling the industrial potential of China through a bloodless blockade , because to do so again might provoke Soviet Russia to war  --  possibly an atomic war . From these fears emerge our present formula of neither winning nor losing the war , and that most pernicious of all forms of appeasement  --  appeasement on the battlefield , The Administration 's " policy " is not calculated to end but to prolong the war and thereby " extend our grievous casualties . " In General Marshall 's complacent phrase , we must suffer " ten years of tension . " Thus fear blinds vision and paralyzes thought . We hope to dissuade Russia from aggression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence in ourselves , we dare venture on no new strategies , not realizing that we are risking everything we fight for by our present half-effort in Korea . There must be an end to all this . The American people will not long suffer the counsels of despair which their leaders have offered them . Actually our strength  --  military , industrial and moral ? is great . We have only to use these strengths to measure up to the challenge of the times . As a great President once said , in a great though different crisis , " All that we have to four in four itself . " Louis B. LEDUC . Camden , N. J. , May 7 , 1951 . Limitation of War Supported To THE EDITOR OF TILE NEW YORK TIMES : THE TIMES is rendering an urgently needed public service in its fair accounts and sane editorials on the controversy over General . I hope that they are being widely republished and thoughtfully pondered . It is fitting that there should be grateful recognition of General 's distinguished military career and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is deplorable that personal feeling and partisan politics are obscuring the real question  --  whether the war in Korea should be extended to China with the risk of Russian intervention and without the support of our allies who are more concerned for Western Europe than for China . It is misleading to discuss General 's replacement as if it were an issue between him and President Truman . I did not vote for Truman and have no predisposition to defend him . But it is only decent as well as patriotic to recognize that he is the lawful President of the United States . In replacing General he acted not only on his own judgment and constitutional authority , but on the judgment of his military advisers Generals Marshall and Bradley , his adviser in the United Nations , the Republican Warren Austin , his special adviser in Far Eastern Affairs , the Republican John Foster Dulles , the United Nations , and the Allied Governments in the North Atlantic Pact , of which the United States is a member by and with the advice and consent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflagration in Korea will not be spread to other lands by any act of ours ; that our course will continue to be charted in accordance with our Constitution and treaty commitments ; that the American people will not be deluded by the notion that the way to prevent another world war is to start one ; and that the killing of our young men in Korea can be stopped by killing them in China Rev. Dr. ARTHUR J. BROWN . New York , May 8 , 1951 . Qualifications to Judge Risks To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In your editorial of May 6 you say : " General makes it quite clear that he believes that a limited expansion of operations in Koreal will bring an early end * * * based on the willingness to accept the risk of formal Soviet intervention and the conviction that such intervention is less likely than many persons fear . " The above is not my understanding of the General 's position . He has stated that there is a risk in either case ? one , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for victory will incite the Russians to greater and more s immediate efforts ; the other , that a planned objective for early and complete victory ? also a risk  --  would he more likely to deter the Reds and bring peace negotiations . On the merits of these two views , General 's judgment is the traditional American way  --  once you get into a war , hit with all you have until victory is won . Also , based on the record of successful achievement , General is better qualified to judge what the Rum . scans might or might not do than anyone else in the policy-making brackets of our present Government  --  or in any other Government in the world today . In the unprecedented island-hopping campaigns that followed Bataan he demonstrated that he could outguess a savage and resourceful enemy and win ? he always won . I suspect also that General MaoArthur believes that Soviet truculence and their zeal in contaminating our citizens to steal our industrial secrets are evidence of their own weakeness and their fear of the intelligence and might of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New York , May 6 , 1951 , Press Blamed for Emotionalism TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I was very much interested in an article published in your paper , " Publisher Says Some Newspapers Stir Up Emotionalism . " The opinion of John Cowles of The Minneapolis Star and Tribune is shared by thousands of people , as was shown in the Presidential election of 1948 , when at least 75 per cent of the American press was against President Truman and did not concede him even a small chance of election , I am 81 and have voted in every Presidential election since 1892 . We had real newspapers then , and such men as Charles Dana , the Pulitzers , etc . What have we now ? Where is our so-called free press ? However , I feel depressed about what is now taking place , especially as regards the lack of freedom of the press . I love my country , and the spectacle in Washington is enough to make all our citizens feel low , excepting , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All he need do is listen to tile proceedings in our capital . All this has been brought about by our own newspapers and some disgruntled politicians , who love their party more than they love their country . Their baleful and vindictive statements are carried in glaring headlines all over the front pages , while denials and rebuttals are evidenced by small news articles hurled away on an inside page , where they will never be seen . Is it any wonder that Mr. Cowles states that if the newspaper men fail to realize the extent and nature of the changes in the world he foresees a hard nod-Inn min rnnc1 nhona Cm. thorn ? LEO WOHL . Brooklyn , N. Y. , May 5 , 1951 . Stens to End War Urged To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I am amazed that TILE NM YORK TIMES has adopted such a negative attitude regarding the Korean War . In your lead editorial of May 5 you go to great lengths to explain why it is impossible for the United States to take the necessary steps to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan or even a suggestion as to how we are to bring this war to an end . The only alternative is to keep sending our boys to Korea as targets for Communist guns , while the United Nations talks interminably and arrives at no conclusion . Our State Department , seemingly without a mind of its own , waits and waits for the United Nations to do something , but the latter , bogged down in protocol and procedures , just keeps on talking . How long are you willing to advocate the depletion of our young manhood by this Korean War ? It can go on indefinitely with its slow but steady loss of life Unless somebody , somewhere does something to put an end to the slaughter . There are three decisions open to us ( 1 ) to continue the war as at present indefinitely , with its slow but steady loss of tile youth of our nation , ( 2 ) j run the risk of a full scale war but doing only what is necessary to bring it to a successful conclusion or ( 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , May 5 , 1951 , Speech in Retrospect To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMER : The speech General gave was one of the most eloquent I have ever heard . The choice of language , the delivery and the audience response were superb . Now , however , I find myself dissatisfied with the perfect performance and asking questions of myself . Why did General spend his great opportunity before the American peop:a in defending ? He knew fr't the receptions he received that he rr.laded no defending . Why did not Mac : . ! rthur accept the challenge given to him to unite the country and be the leader we so badly need ? Why should we be the aggressors and attack Red China if , as General pointed out so clearly to us , the Orient is through with the old Imperialistic way of force by the white man ? One more disturbing thought the general left with us ? Red China is far more advanced and much stronger than anybody knows . All the more reason for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and all the more reason for us to be sure we are ready to take on a war of such proportions . RUTH S. TUKEY .
