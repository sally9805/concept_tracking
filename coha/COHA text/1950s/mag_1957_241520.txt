In the third-floor composing room of the Chicago Sun-Times last week , a forklift truck nosed up to a clattering Linotype and tweaked it away from under the operator 's fingers . Backing out , the tractor trundled the two-ton Linotype to a special elevator hoist that whisked it into a waiting truck on Franklin Street . Twenty minutes later the Linotype , its lead still molten , clattered back into action at the new $20 million Sun-Times building on the north side of the Chicago River , six blocks away . <P> No detail of the newspaper 's massive move had been left to chance . The date had been picked in consultation with a meteorological firm which assured the paper that the Windy City would remain calm for the operation . In case of traffic tie-ups at the drawbridges , two big speedboats were standing by to haul light equipment across the river . The move went as smoothly as an enchainement in a Royal Ballet Swan Lake . By the time all 44 Linotypes ( cost : up to $20,000 each ) had been uprooted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the titanic transfer had not delayed its press runs a single minute . <P> While staffers downed farewell toasts of ouzo , a high-octane Athenian absinthe dispensed by the saloon next door to the old building , Sun-Times management rolled up its sleeves for a long-awaited scrap . Restricted to 96-page press runs by inadequate mechanical facilities in the old building , ailing Marshall Field Jr . ' s fast-rising Sun-Times had to turn away advertisers 14 days last year , once had to forgo 17 pages of ads . The new presses , capable of turning out 128-page papers , will also allow the Sun-Times to go all out for the added circulation it could not handle in its old building . Now the ninth biggest U.S. newspaper , the Sun-Times ( circ. 588,181 ) boasts that it has overtaken John S. Knight 's Chicago News ( 614,098 ) in ad volume , and is steadily edging up to the Chicago Tribune ( 943,741 ) . " Now , " vowed a Sun-Times executive , " we will go to the mat with the Trib.
