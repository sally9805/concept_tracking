 | The art of matchmaking is as old as the human race ? particularly the female half of the human race . If Eve had had a sister , the chances are that as soon as Adam and Eve had settled down . Eve would have begun to heckle him to bring home some eligible bachelors . There is a special glint in a woman 's eye when she estimates the possibility of marrying off two single people of her acquaintance , preferably to each other . There 's Helen . she ponders ? such a sweet girl , obviously designed for wifehood . And there 's Bill ? doing so well at his job but living that awful bachelor 's life . with who knows what kind of meals . He needs stability , even if he does n't know it , and she needs a man to take care of her . So why not , muses the matchmaker , invite Bill and Helen to dinner and then , well , see ? What a nice , warm , generous idea ! Theoretically you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapturously . It 's love from the first meeting . There 's a whirlwind courtship and a church wedding , with you as matron of honor . Stretching into the years ahead is a vista of wonderful happiness for two fine people who would never have known each other except for you . Now that 's done . you can look around for some other lives to arrange . What 's wrong with all this ? Nothing , provided it happens that way . The trouble is that too often somebody changes the script . Helen and Bill do not fall in love at first sight . They may not be an ideal pair at all . But once you have embarked on your crusade , you perhaps continue to connive and propagandize . The least that happens then is that Helen and Bill are mutually embarrassed . to the point where your friendship with each of them is jeopardized . At worst your campaign succeeds ? but superficially . It gives false impetus to a forced-draft romance . What started off as a gay matchmaking game ends in heartbreak or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman of your acquaintance you 'd like to see married , and are you casting about for a likely man for her ? Do you know a bachelor you consider much too marriageable to be still at large . and have you found the very girl for him ? Do n't . At least not until you 've very soberly considered the possible consequences , and , above all , until you 've searched your soul for the reason why you 'd like to see these two people mated . Are you really interested only in doing a good deed for two good friends ? Or , perhaps without realizing are you playing games with other folks ' lives primarily to satisfy some hidden drive of your own ? Before you sputter , " How ridiculous ! " think . Let 's say the girl in the case is your own younger sister . Betsey , and you have been moving heaven and earth to get her squared away with ' that nice Pete from your husband 's office . Is it possible that any good would accrue to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from a very fine family ( a jot above yours in the social scale . as a matter of fact ) and that , although you have n't given it a thought consciously , there 's a hidden part of you that would enjoy saying casually . " Yes , the Van Blue Bloods ? he 's m brother-in-law , you know " ? Or maybe you 're really terribly attached to Betsey. both as your closest feminine confidante and as a younger-sister admirer who loyally thinks you can do no wrong . So you just ca n't bear to lose her ! And it would be so perfect if she were to marry Pete and live around the corner forever . You see how it works ? Once you begin to peek below the surface , you can almost always spy out additional motivations for matchmaking . There 's the subconscious wish for intellectual prestige . for instance ( He has three degrees ! ) or money advantage ( The connection would strengthen your husband 's position at the plant ) or possibly even beauty prestige , if your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy in his class , or She could have married anybody . she 's that breath-taking ! ) . Perfectly human . understandable motives , all of them .  | but really quite irrelevant to the happiness of the pair under fire . Now is there any real danger in motives such as these ? Surely no two adults will get married solely on your recommendation . Anything you do or say could hardly " make " two people take so serious a step as marriage , could it ? Why be so concerned ? That 's just where you could be wrong . Your influence may be far stronger than you know , and you might easily be a major factor in causing two people to marry , especially if you put on a real campaign . True , an intensely strong love will endure either with or without your help , but there 's many a lukewarm affection that can survive only in the most favorable surroundings . Take Betsey and Pete again . Since these youngsters are inexperienced , they 're bound to be uncertain . And since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And that 's where the danger lies . Betsey and Pete do not really know themselves yet , and they have n't had time to sort out their personal values . So they might easily accept yours if sufficiently exposed to them . If you and your husband invite these young people to a party , followed by a country weekend , and then consistently pair them off , they may quite quickly find themselves swept along in a stream of events not really of their own choosing . Particularly when you begin to link their names together in one breath ? Pete-andBetsey ? so that everyone else begins to pronounce it like one name too . And when significant little glances flash between you as you pointedly leave them alone  | together , Betsey and Pete may begin to feel , Everyone expects it , so it must be love . Except maybe it is n't . As they could tragically find out five years and two children later . Why do so many of us find ourselves automatically campaigning every time we see people whom we think would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the institution of marriage , as such . We believe in marriage , and because we have found it good for ourselves , we simply assume it will be good for everybody else . So we just ca n't resist trying to make converts . We should remember that the very factors that make us find marriage so gratifying may be lacking in Jane and Joe . The same circumstances that make Joe look eligible ? he 's thirty-five , never been married , and successful ? could be a clue that psychologically Joe is really incapable of sharing his life . And the fact that Mary is twenty-nine and lonely , far from making her the ideal candidate , could indicate that she has an emotional block that would seriously cripple her chances as a happy wife . The truth is that marriage does not necessarily solve unhappy people 's problems , rosy as our visions of such a solution might be . Does all this mean that you should deliberately avoid introducing two single people ? Of course not ! Sharing your friends is one of the pleasures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that a man or woman who does n't know many people has a chance to meet some new ones . But there 's a vast difference in saying to a girl , " Why do n't you drop over for breakfast Sunday morning ? our friend Sam Clark will be here , " and saying , " Now , look . There 's going to be a man I think would be just perfect for you . Have your hair done and wear your new pink dress . Frankly , dear , you 'd better put your best foot forward ; there are n't many men left , you know ! " It 's the deliberate machinations that do the mischief , the forthright or subtle pressures , the involved little plots . Above all it 's the canny appeal to fear or loneliness that makes matchmaking the dangerous meddling it can be . So mix your single friends as freely as you like , but do n't take over their lives for them . And do n't attempt to strike a match ? if you do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
