Missionary William Eugene Rively had been at sea three days in his outrigger canoe with its crew of five Caroline Islanders . They were a bare 13 miles from their destination , at 5 p.m. of a beautiful day , when the typhoon struck . <P> It broke upon the frail 25-ft. craft with howling wind , pelting rain , and huge , smashing waves . Missionary Rively ( rhymes with lively ) and his men hung on and bailed and prayed . For three days they ran before the storm , half the time without food . By the time they reached Truk , they had spent twelve days at sea . <P> Father Vincent Kennally , S.J. , superior of the Caroline and Marshall Islands Mission , was distressed . He had long taken a dim view of the outrigger jaunts of Jesuit Rively-the only one of the priests in his mission who did not make his inter-island calls by powerboat . A few months later , after Father Rively had undergone an operation for appendicitis , his superior sent him back to the U.S. to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent ship , " he ordered . <P> This week , Father Bill Rively , 33 , will sail happily out through San Francisco 's Golden Gate on a 45-ft. schooner named Romance . He had found his ship , and he was sailing her back to Truk and his life 's work . <P> Baseball &; Catechism . Bill Rively , whose father ran the china section of an Altoona ( Pa. ) department store , decided in the eighth grade that he was going to be a missionary . He was a student at the Jesuit university in Manila when the Japanese took over the Philippines in 1942 . After three years of internment ( and down from 180 to 130 Ibs . ) , Rively went back to his seminary studies . Ordination came a year later , then three more years of study . At last his mission assignment came-to Truk . " I had to look it up on a map , " he says . <P> Father Rively 's parish consists of 105,000 square miles of island-speckled ocean . He has special charge of 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5,000-about 4,000 of them Christian . His flock , says Father Rively , are " wonderfully carefree people . They fish , gather breadfruit and sing constantly . " At 4:30 each morning the patere , as they call him , begins the day with Mass. then spends the morning in classes for the children . They sit on the warm sand while the priest , who can speak all three dialects of his parish , stands at a blackboard expounding arithmetic , geography and the Roman Catholic faith . <P> In the afternoon there is usually a baseball game . Father Rively pitches or plays shortstop , then , clad in white cassock and sneakers , gives instruction in the catechism and a brief doctrinal sermon . In his first two years there , he estimates , he converted some 500 natives . <P> Crying for the Carolines . As his crew on the Romance , Missionary Rively has taken a 70-year-old captain , a cook and three other hands . They will all be flown back to the U.S. on arrival at Truk , and the Romance will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , " Missionary Rively explained as he worked busily in blue jeans and turtlenecked sweater to get his craft ready . " I feel I 'm wasting my time in the States . I 'll never be homesick because , quite frankly , I like it better in the Carolines. "
