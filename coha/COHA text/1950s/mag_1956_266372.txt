When the younger jazzmen did away with Dixieland and big-band swing and dove into the cool depths of bop and progressive jazz , they also left behind the sweet , lucid sound of the clarinet . Once known as an ill woodwind that nobody blows good , this relatively new instrument suddenly struck the U.S. mass ear in the 1920s in the hands of Ted Lewis , who made it wail , and reached peak popularity in the pre-World War II days of Benny Goodman and Artie Shaw , who made it swing . It is still a must in every Dixieland and New Orleans jazz group , but is rare as a hot lick in modern combos . What happened ? <P> Says Goodman , resting in his Stamford , Conn , home between weekend dance dates with his big band : " The clarinet has a quality that 's kind of oldfashioned . I think it sort of irks the moderns ; it sort of throws them . They 've found ways to disguise the sound of other instruments , especially the trumpet . They make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But any good clarinetist makes it sound like a clarinet . They got ta . " <P> Artie Shaw agrees . " The clarinet is a clear , positive instrument . Cool music has a tendency toward fuzziness . It depends on hints or suggestions rather than definite , clear-cut statements . Most so-called cool jazz seems to have evolved from music played in low ranges-trombones , tenor and baritone saxophones . " Clarinetist Shaw is currently living in Spain , building himself a huge stone mansion on the Costa Brava , and talking about retiring to live in it . <P> A few clarinetists have managed to make their instruments speak in a style that falls somewhere between the solid fundamentals of swing and the freest flights of progressive jazz . Their methods are similar : play a basic melody in the old style and elaborate it with floods of notes in rhythmically diverse patterns . Explains Manhattan 's Tony Scott : " I want the simple cry of jazz that a gospel singer might put in five notes-only I may use 15 . " The effect is a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholly palatable . <P> Clarinet-playing Bandleader Woody Herman , who has managed to go modern after starting out as a swingster , refuses to admit that the clarinet has lost caste . " Brother , the clarinet still sounds as sweet and ridey as ever , " he says . " The big fault lies in the lack of new men . Guys like Goodman , Shaw and myself should lend a hand , but Goodman is too busy sorting his jewelry , Shaw is still having trouble keeping track of his girls , and me , well , I have the problem of trying to keep up with Uncle Whiskers on my tax bill . Sure , we 've lost ground , but when you listen to guys like Tony Scott , Buddy De Franco and Jimmy Giuffre , you suddenly discover there 's still something new in music expressed by the clarinet .
