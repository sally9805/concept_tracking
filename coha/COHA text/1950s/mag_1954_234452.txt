In the literary world of the ' 203 and ' 303 , the most comical character on the U.S. scene was the hale &; hearty joiner who slapped his fellow businessmen on the back at service-club luncheons and addressed total strangers as " Tom , " " Dick " or " Harry . " Sinclair Lewis called him " Babbitt , " H. L. Mencken called him " boob , " and many another writer dismissed him simply as " a Rotarian . " <P> Last week , as nearly 9,000 Rotarians gathered in Seattle for the 45th annual convention of the world 's largest service club , a back or two was certainly slapped . Total strangers called each other by their first names without let or hindrance . But the names were called in accents that ranged from the flat twang of the Western plains through Teutonic gutterals and mellifluous Urdu to the cool precision of Oxford English . And they were n't all Tom and Harry . There were Karls and Kims and Bongs and Phyas and Mohammed Alis and Yoshinoris and Joaquins and Chaunceys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as " Funeral Director , Waxahachie , Texas " and " Medicine , Wagga Wagga , Australia . " A Good Proposition . Rotary International , like the other U.S. service clubs ( Lions , Kiwanis , Exchange , etc. ) , was founded with the simple idea of giving plain but often circumscribed businessmen a chance to meet and make friends . <P> It embodied no high-flown phrases . One of the four founding fathers , a tailor , admitted frankly that " the idea of my making a lot of new friends-who presumably would be working overtime to get people to come and have their clothes made at my place-struck me as a pretty good proposition . " As the club has expanded to include some 390,000 members in 89 countries , the underlying principle is still the same one of friendship and understanding . <P> Last week no less a diplomat than Secretary of State John Foster Dulles traveled to Seattle to acknowledge Ro-tary 's influence . " You are here , " he said , " because you share ideals in common . " Tall , short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Rotarians seemed to care a fig for political hairsplitting . There were no thundering denunciations from the speaker 's platform , no thinly veiled polit ical polemics , no sweeping resolutions . " We do not believe , " said Rotary International Secretary George Means , " in resoluting about anything unless we can do something about it . " <P> Pretty Much the Same . From all over the world came reports that Rotary was doing things . Often , what it did seemed so puny as to be almost insignificant in the vast sweep of world affairs . It had , for instance , brought 57 young students from 18 nations to study together in Sweden . It organized a blood-bank program in war-torn Korea . It sent a young Pakistani to make friends in Washington 's Yakima Valley . It is sponsoring an international network of radio hams . Its magazines had kept Rotarians in Kenya , Viet Nam and Trieste posted on the activities of their fellows in Ceylon , Wichita and Sioux City .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
