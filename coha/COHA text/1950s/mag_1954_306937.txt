Suspense novels are meant to transport a man from his drab daily anxieties into a euphoric state of really high-class terror . Most authors in the suspense business used to accomplish this by piling up murder and mayhem , sin and skulduggery with all the subtlety of a meat-ax killer . That style is still widely practiced , but in recent years the suspense formula has become as elastic as a private eye 's suspenders . It has often been stretched to include such weighty matters as character , group psychology , politics and sometimes even good writing . Thus a new category was created-well below the occasional Henry Jamesian thrillers turned out by such serious writers as Marghanita Laski ( see below , but several steps above the Mickey Spillane gutter . A batch of new novels demonstrates the current suspense range from simple , old-fashioned sex fiends to complex , introverted drawing-room villains . <P> The Flaw in the Crystal by Godfrey Smith ( Putnam ; $3.50 ) is a brightly written , sprightly little tour de force that is all the more remarkable from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Englishmen involved in London high jinks and international low life .

If there is no flaw in Several 's loyalty , he is to be sent abroad on a vital secret mission . Meredith 's search leads through the brilliant , overlapping aristocratic , political , literary and journalistic worlds of London to the discovery of a magnetic and completely seductive personality . It also leads to an ingenious surprise ending and the disclosure that the flaw of a many-faceted crystal sometimes lies in its hard perfection . <P> The Time of the Fire by Marc Brandel ( Random House ; $3 ) is a workmanlike portrait of a small American town and its mass hysteria under the terror of a homicidal maniac . The terror and hysteria rise to a high boil when the remains of local women are found neatly decapitated and expertly carved . Before the killer gets his comeuppance , the frigid daughter of one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and townsmen are brought to naked life with considerable psychological insight . <P> Terror on Broadway by David Alexander ( Random House ; $2.75 ) is written in a language that bears a deceptive resemblance to English but is actually Broadwayese . In Novelist Alexander 's hands , it is a blunt instrument that he uses to hammer out the unhappy saga of Waldo . Waldo is a psychopathic killer who gets a boyish kick out of playing ticktacktoe with a knife on the bodies of the ladies he dispatches . It is perfectly clear at the very beginning that Waldo is going to be caught by Hero Bart Hardin , editor of the Broadway Times , a journal devoted to horses and hoofers . On page eleven it is disclosed that Hardin 's Broadway trademark is his collection of eleven gaudy vests , the latest being " a dove gray number with yellow tulips . " Obviously , Waldo does n't have a chance .
