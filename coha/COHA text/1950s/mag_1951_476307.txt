This study of our Eighth Army in Korea and the battle conditions it faced has been adapted from a series of articles which first appeared in the Detroit News , then were reprinted in the Combat Forces Journal . Believing that it should interest a less localized and specialized audi-ence , we present it here with some revisions to take account of the difference in media and the passage of time . Colonel S. L. A. Marshall , chief editorial writer of the Detroit News and author of ( among a number of books ) Men Against Fire , Island Victory , and Bastogne , was Chief Historian of the European Theater and has a high reputation as a student of warfare . ON LEAVING the Far East Command , the visitor about to board a plane must first sign a paper pledging that he will not " communicate or transmit to any persons , orally , in writing , or otherwise " any information , data , or rumor relating to " military operations , units , materiel , logistics , allies , civilian components , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the universe itself except in vague terms , perhaps there are some things that might be said candidly about Korea and the war there without pulling down the pillars of the temple or drawing a year in the guardhouse . Not that I have any quarrel with the censorship . During the greater part of the police action in Korea , some correspondents reported the war with such gross carelessnessthat they jeopardized ? and quite unnecessarily ? the lives of fighting men . When that happens , the curb of censorship must be applied . Something is lost by it , but things even more vital gain increased protection . There remain as topics for fruitful discussion the land and people of Korea , the nature of our enemies , the day-to-day problems of men in battle , and the new-found character of our own fighting forces . Fundamentally these are the important things . I went to Korea in November and returned in March . My initial task was to measure Chinese tactics and firepower , and then suggest methods and techniques whereby our battle line could develop greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , published to the Eighth Army in December , were made public in January . So there is no longer any secret about the mission . My work took me down to our infantry line regiments and their supporting artillery battalions , both in the Marines and the Army . In what 1 did , I was given the unreserved backing of the staff and command . It has never been my privilege to work among a finer , more open-minded group of men than you will find in the operating sections of the force now commanded by Lieutenant General James A. Van Fleet . They were that way even in the dark hours of December , when it seemed that the skies were about to fall . Their warmth compensated for certain lacks in the Korean weather . II EITHER photography , word description , nor any map can ever convey an ade- quate sense of the Korean countryside and the extraordinary rigor it imposes on our combat forces . I saw some of it afoot , more of it from jeep-back , and the greater part of it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , I can say honestly that had I seen none of it that would have been enough . Here is the grimmest hardship of this small war . There is a bleak , unadulterated misery about this land and its people that wears at one 's fiber and chills the bloodstream . The soldier bears an added cross in this campaign , and it is a source of much painful brooding . Combat is n't too bad when some measure of relief , some touch of sweetness and light , is to he found between the spells of battle . In Korea there is no relief ? save comradeship and mail from home . Troops rotated out of line for a few days simply trade one form of environmental wretchedness for another . The weather can be endured ; the winter cold is not much worse than in Michigan , and there is less snowfall . In the fighting , the prospect of meeting sudden death is no greater ? in fact , it is calculably less ? than in wars past when our enemies had competent artillery and air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , like Spain , like Switzerland or the state of Montana . AU these other places have one thing in common . Their mountain barriers provide a contrast to some more hospitable terrain ? abroad and fertile valley , the sweep of great plains , a plateau , a forest . But not Korea . Beyond the next mountain there is only another mountain . Off the flank of the next ridge there is only another ridge . From the Strait of Tsushima to the Yalu River , this is the way of it ? an endless monotony of something to be climbed and cursed . In this respect the map is peculiarly deceptive . The valleys are narrower than shown ; small hills hem the river trenches , turning every passageway into a defile . There are fairly straight and level roads paralleling the Han River as it flows toward Kimpo and Inchon . Otherwise the great basin around Seoul , which looks on the map like a flat meadowland , is also a place of ups and downs . Nor is any other hill country quite like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Wonsan and the Yalu , the mountains are a true massif , with peaks towering into thin air , rivers flowing through deep gorges , and one-way roads carved into the mountainside . But the greater part of Korea is upended in a complex of ridges , hogbacks , sugarloaf peaks , and barren domes too low to be called mountains and too formidable to be classed as hills . It is a land half-made , neither fish nor fowl . " God got tired when He was making the world , " runs a GI saying . " Hence Korea . " . Of tree cover along the Korean heights , there is some scrub growth , occasional small pines , and a few thickets . But the slopes are for the most part barren , and the ridge-lines usually rise to a thin edge of sheer rock , leaving nothing for a hand-hold . It is along these precipitous heights that the battle surges to and fro , as our men advance single file to blast the Chinese out of an eyrie where they have sought cover against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitched the contest . Eighty per cent of the heavy fighting is done uphill . It has to be done that way , for the enemy uses the high ground to interdict with automatic fire our advance along the low ground . Such flats as exist are covered by paddies or houses , and the terraced paddies run right up into the draws and saddles of the lower ridges . In winter , the paddies freeze over and the guns can be set up on the ice . In summer , they are as forbidding to guns as a swamp , and the artillery must roam along the roads , looking for a wide intersection , a bean patch , or a cornfield ? which are hard to come by . As usual , the worst part of the burden falls on the infantry . Mountain climbing is strenuous exercise . When it is done for sport , it is considered a sufficient achievement , after reaching the top , for the climber to descend without breaking his neck . In Korea the average infantry company climbs all day to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls , there is always the next one , with another enemy band dug in along its crest . Such is the harshness of these grades that our men can move upward only two to three thousand yards a day . Then they must stand and fight or be done in They arc not weaklings . You would have to see these hills to know why these things are so . And they have gotten used to it . They are legged-up , canny about the use of shrub and rock cover . They know the enemy 's trick of concealing his best positions in the ridge saddles . They are capable of organizing together to best advantage the high ground when they win it . But Nature never permits a turning-back of the clock , and what you missed in youth you can not regain in maturity . Middle-aged Koreans who hardened themselves to their hills in early childhood can walk twice as far into them as an American soldier , and carry double the load . W I IAT about the enemy ? In combat , the Chinese Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither crafty nor bold . They succeeded for a time and in part by dint of numbers , but even while it was happening their success did not cover their lack of fire efficiency and personal resourcefulness in the ranks . Their battle doctrine is too inflexible to be suited even to the terrain of Korea , which is otherwise favorable to their design . From divisions on down to squads , units committed to battle are given one line on which they must persist ? win , lose , or draw . So they continue to bloody their heads against impossible situations until they are broken . They make war as if the judgment or common sense of anyone lower than an army group commander was not to be trusted . Most of the wild , frenzied charges we read about , in which screaming hordes of Chinese moved like a human tide straight into theface of fire , and up and over the American line , never happened at all . Like most of the bayonet charges , also feverishly reported , they are figments of the correspondents ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American soldier , who will never let a fellow down for lack of a good story . There have been some Chinese mass attacks straight into the gun line ? one such was pressed against the 23d Infantry Regiment at Chipyong ? but that is extraordinary . In the usual scene , the CCF attack comes on raggedly . They are not a well-disciplined soldiery . In the approach , they usually give themselves away by the noise they make ? something our own troops have well learned not to do . When fired upon they hit the dirt , even as you or I. When prodded and kicked forward , they sometimes go , sometimes not . When wounded , they cry for the first-aid man . The supply system of this horde is about as crude as that of any army since the day of Genghis Khan . It operates without compassion for man or beast . After troops once reach the front , they are lucky if anything at all gets up to them . When such munitions as they have carried forward are spent , they often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They pack along small bags of rice or beans or maize . After that ration has vanished down their gullets , they are expected to live on the land . where the pickings are slender indeed . Starvation has taken a heavy toll of the CCF in Korea , and more of their strength has been lost to cold and Freezing than ours by at least twenty to one . With few exceptions , their formations were thrown into Korea in the dead of winter , without overcoats . blankets , or sleeping bags . As best they could , they preserved themselves with animal heat , by herding tight together in huts and foxholes , so that one man would draw warmth from another 's body . In the midst of battle , with things coming their way , they draw off to loot a camp , such is their shortage of creature comforts . The medical service is so thin that not one-tenth of their needs are met . T HEIR tactics are about as elementary as the law of gravity or the movement of sand blown across desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese have taken over the Russian system whole and modified it according to the limits dictated by their arms supply . That is pure drip ! What they are doing is as Chinese as bird's-nest soup , with a special Japanese sauce added . ( They did learn a few tricks from the late enemy , while serving as his punching bag for ten years . ) I doubt that the CCF tactical system , however , would be even partially effective in any other terrain than Korea , and I do n't except the Chinese mainland . ( This might suggest that they have been plotting a Korean intervention for some time . ) Committed on this unhappy peninsula , the Chinese adapted themselves to the facts of its geography . Less nimble than the Koreans in scaling the mountain peaks , they dug in deeper , camouflaged better , and maneuvered around the heights more intelligently once they got there . They knew that with our heavy train we would be compelled to go forward over the main roads , and that with our weak numbers there could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough ground off our flanks . Main roads , of their nature . hold to the low ground of river valleys . The Chinese columns could move toward ours along these same lines ? for a distance ? moving only at night to avoid destruction from the air . But they could never risk head-on engagement , column against column , at a right angle to - the line on which we were moving forward . That would make things much too simple for our preponderant artillery and armor , and our unopposed air power . There was an alternative in grand tactics , never heretofore exploited on a full scale with a whole army conforming to it . By night they brought their divisions forward along the main routes , concealing them carefully by day . They simply vanished . They went off into the feeder valleys flanking the main highways . There they holed up in the Korean villages , hidden by thatched roofs . Such is their disregard for human comfort that a battalion could be stowed away in twenty huts or so . Slightly forward of these maneuver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese in the main valley , dug in along the ridge lines athwart the main road . They were a blocking force , prepared to hold their ground to the last man . When they becamefully engaged , that would be the hour for the maneuver groups to hit us . Geography ? the simple fact that the feeder valleys were at an oblique to the central valley ? determined that when they did so they would be on the flanks and moving against the rear of our main forces . It was a pat scheme and we might have reckoned on it , but if all such matters could be clearly seen beforehand war would be as simple as weaving a daisy chain . From the repetition of several arresting facts came the revelation . Why did the Chinese columns always strike obliquely against our axis ? Why were these relatively unskilled soldiers invariably finding our main rearward installations , though ( for reasons I need not reveal here ) it was clear that they blundered into them rather than knew their exact location ? The answers lay more in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying what the Chinese were attempting to do became , in Sherlock Holmes ' word , " elementary , " and it was easier to get on with the job . Why have n't more of them surrendered ? It is a good question . On their side , moral power is very uneven . One day they will put up a poor show ? fire wildly and quit good ground with no more than a token resistance . On the next , they fight like Mad Mullahs and insist on dying to the last man . In contrast , the great redeeming quality of the American GI is that he stays pretty much on an even keel , come hell or high water . Such battle ardor as the average Chinese fighter possesses seems not to be of Communist making , though it is conceivable that a general desire to see the White Man cast off the Asiatic continent may have been exploited . The majority of the prisoners talk freely and , though many are illiterate in our sense of the word , with great intelligence . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do not know its meaning . They are listless toward their government 's reasons for the Korean intervention . For yet other reasons , you get the feeling that many of these men face fire mainly to end an earthly misery beyond enduring . But getting a local surrender under the irregular conditions of the Korean war is a complex technical problem . A white flag may be raised : one group wants to quit . But by the time all defensive fires are called off so that they may safely come in , a considerable period has elapsed . Someone has gotten over to the white-flag waver and liquidated his intent . So the war wears on , according to a pattern which initially cost us a bath of blood , but in the latter stages has been the undoing of the patternmaker . III HAT about our own soldiers ? Possibly , in the search for dramatic val- ues , our newsmen in Korea have slighted the simpler , but no less significant , things in the routine of the combat soldier 's life . A number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that these men have become wise far beyond their years , and have a toughened outlook toward the job far beyond anything dreamed of in recent times . As to shelter , it 's pretty much catch-ascatch-can . A battalion commander is given a certain area on the map in which to quarter his troops . He looks the ground over . There may he a few habitable Korean homes ? drafty things with walls of rice paper on slat frames , doorways too low for a Singer 's midget , puncheon floors , and no heat . Or , by luck , he may draw a schoolhouse , built according to the same architectural principles but with more air and less dirt . These are all very good places , and it is surprising how inviting they soon become when there is nothing outside but weather . However , since the war has already shaken down the greater part of what man has built in Korea , the forward parts of the Army are perforce making a gradual return to canvas . For the first time since Grandpa went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " with some truth in it . The food situation is not like life on the farm , but the Army as a whole has never had it better during any war in a distant theater . Unfortunately this does n't apply to the companies moving forward in the attack or in contact with the enemy . Supply is abundant right up to the frontal zone , but getting it forward over that additional twelve to thirtyfive hundred yards from the assembly area in the low ground to the line where fire is striking along the hill crest remains a besetting problem . Lacking animal transport , not yet having systematized a native carrier system , and with all our own frontal forces stretched extremely thin , we still ca n't insure that the men who fight will also be regularly fed . It is not unusual for a company during engagement to go twenty-four hours without food . In a three- or four-day fight , the men of a battalion may average one meal per day ? most likely part of a cold C ration . This is so despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marches on its stomach . But far from this being a cause of persistent griping among the troops , they take it with a grin . Sometimes they boast about how long they have gone without food with no marked shrinking of the waistline . To a large extent , it 's a matter of personal choice . Faced with the hard option of going forward with enough weapons and other killing materials to be sure of holding the ground or reducing the munitions load to make room for a ration ( at the possible risk of not remaining alive to eat it ) , the typical American infantry company in Korea goes forward on a fresh-air diet . They have come so far along the road of war that they know which way is up even if they do n't care which side their bread is buttered on . The same applies to every other item of comfort and the good life . I have seen companies in the attack fifteen degrees above zero . Night was coming on and it would find them on a mountain peak battling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcoats and sleeping bags behind , knowing that they would lose a certain number of men from frostbite , but agreeing that this was better than to cut down the fire load and take the risk that the whole company might be overrun . 7 ITHIN less than artillery range of the front lines , the basic and personal supply situation straightens itself out . The A ration ? which includes perishable meats , vegetables , dairy products , and fresh fruits ? gets farther forward than ever before , and it is not unusual to see steaks , roast turkey , chicken , or a good side of fresh beef served at infantry messes when troops are in support . I had never expected to shake hands with a filet mignon while listening to a mortar barrage , but war is a succession of surprises . These Waldorf dinners are not the regular fare . They come just often enough between servings of corned beef , tinned vegetables , and jam to whet the taste buds . The routine ration is larger and on the whole more varied than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ package of bittersweet chocolate , hard biscuit , or some such thing which a soldier can carry in his pocket would be a boon to operations . The greatly publicized beer ration rarely gets up to the front-line fighter , which pleases no one except the WCT1J , but candy , chewing gum , razor blades , and such are in good supply . And the Eighth Army fairly wallows in fresh clothing . The front-line fighter may have to go three or four weeks without a bath when the pressure is on , but he is never far away from a complete change of dress if he needs it . - In fact , the supply is so good that wastage is excessive . Special Services gets movies as far forward as the support positions , where they are usually shown in a small tent with the GI audience stacked three deep . Invariably they are old movies . Thus in March the newsreels running tip front portrayed the " final smashing victory of UN forces in Korea " ? the falsealarm campaign of last October . This bit of bombast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been listening to Bob Hope . The uninitiated are likely to think of the war in these Hollywood terms or as an unceasing trial by fire for those engaged in fighting it . But , of course , it is n't like that in Korea any more than it has been in other wars of our past . In fact the nature of the struggle . made so by the irregular character of the warfare , is such that there is less active fighting per unit per day than in past operations . In Korea however , there is also less rest in a rest period than ever before . There have been great battles ? such as that of the 2d Infantry Division along the Chongchon or the 1st Marines around the Chosin Reservoir ? when practically every man from the commanding general on down found himself a rifleman . But these arc climactic events rather than examples of the day-to-day contest . The enemy builds up around a few strong-points ; none can be approached on a very broad front . When a battalion is committed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , or perhaps two , will be underheavy pressure , and then for only a day or two until a respite comes . The typical infantry company probably does not average more than one day out of five or six in firing and being fired upon at close quarters . That is bad enough . It would wear down inferior men to spend some part of every week in a shooting gallery . But some of the hard rock of the Korean country seems to have melted into the heart and spirit of the Americans who are fighting there . The Eighth is n't a wearing-down army . There is little malingering in it . Now and then when the fire flares , a man " bugs out " from the fight and looks for cooler ground . But there are no gangs of runaways in the rear area . There have never been any . " Combat fatigue " has become almost a Forgotten term among our troops , though they do have hours when they are so fatigued from combat that they would drop if they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has always been reported here . I 've read some columns , for instance , about wholesale flight and disgraceful panic within the Eighth Army during the November battle . Those who wrote these things lied in their teeth ! Nothing of that kind happened , though some units were so terribly broken in the battle that after the first three or four days they no longer had any fighting power . Good fighting men were cut raw by these slanders . They asked what kind of country it was that would permit such things to be said . Iv WILL say , without a qualifying word , that the men of the Eighth Army are the hard- est-hitting , most workmanlike soldiers I have yet seen in our uniform in the course of three wars . Day by day these formations ? Army and Marine ? are as capable of high action as any troops alive . They take their losses like men . When ordered into the line again , they grouse like men and not like overage adolescents . It is amazing to watch them slog along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third man will move with a limp ? a souvenir of the preceding day 's climb and of the shoepac , which is an insult to any fighter 's feet . But I have heard them singing as they moved along in single file on either side of the road , carrying their fighting baggage and sometimes their barracks bags , for Jack of any other transport . And I have watched them pass the bird , the boo , and the studied affront to some rival regiment as they passed . " Send up a battalion , bums , and we 'll let it relieve one of our platoons . " Shades of the past ! Who ever expected that this could happen to the American Army again ! It sounds like 1918 . And I think somebody ought to make the rounds and tell soldiers training here in the interior about it so that they will know they have something to model themselves upon . I T WOULD be a pleasure to be able to say that this strong stuff comes of belief in the United Nations ' cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight course under steady hands , and unbounded confidence in leadership all the way from the hilltops back to the Capitol Dome . But it just is n't true ! These men do n't give a tinker 's toot for all the nice literature ? including that published by the Armed Forces Information and Education Division ? which tells them of the nobility of their effort and what may come of it . They do n't like anything in Washington except the Finance Office . They respect Tokyo ? as a leave center . They have simply ceased worrying about any part of this small change . In the six black weeks of December and early January the Eighth Army scraped bottom morally . The black-out in our affairs was felt by the man in the most forward foxhole . That was black Christmas . Spirits sank so low that from then on there was no place to go but up . Near the end of the futile search for something solid to hold onto , the men of the Eighth Army at last found one another . General Matt Ridgway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said some very polite words about the United Nations and some very earnest words about why Americans must fight when that 's the one way to meet the situation . He added. : " The job is to kill Chinese . " That struck the right note to an Army which was already concluding that survival was the one unbeatableargument . There had been some sober thinking along these lines in other quarters . The worst thing ahont any new opponent in war is the air of mystery around him . Until you case him , a pygmy may throw a shadow as long as a giant . So it had been with the Chinese . They came like wraiths in the night , blowing their bugles , tooting their shepherd ' horns , and shrilling their bronze whistlis from all points of the compass as they close# upon a perimeter . Quite deliberately , they were using noise as a weapon to unstrint nerves . And it worked , but only for so long as it took to determine exactly what they were doing . Rifle companies told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hair stood on end and they were dried of speech . And the men swore , " They blew Taps ? our own call ? after they had beaten us down , and it was scary as hell . " That is how imagination soars in battle . For it was not " Taps " they had heard , but a Chinese reassembly call which ends on the same three mournful notes . So we hunted hard until we found one bugle , one shepherds ' horn , and one bronze whistle ? taken from the bodies of dead Chinese . A shop was set up to duplicate them , and then they were tooted until the nerves of our men were quite conditioned to the noise . And then they were taken into the line and the Chinese were confused by their own music . That early fear , as the Chinese attack by night , is gone now . In the attack , our men scream like Comanches , give forth with Rebel yells , and shout much that is unprintable . On defense , it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team . In recording battle experiences in World War II , I had to report that we had put into the field one of the most silent armies of our history .. There was so little talk between men in combat that at times we had deliberately to encourage it , in order to plcvent front-line communications ? and the sense of other men being there ? from breaking down . Now all that has changed . This is the real thing . The American Army is finding its vocal chords again .
