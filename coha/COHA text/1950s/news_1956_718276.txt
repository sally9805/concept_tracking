txt President Eisenhower said today he does not regard as entirely wise the constitutional amendment that bars a third presidential term . Mr. Eisenhower , making no attempt to ! apply his remarks to his own ease , said he believes thil. ** be . able to choose as President anybody they want , regardless of the number of terms . He told a ? news conference that there have been objections that this might concentrate power in one individual . But he said he has the utmost confidence in the long-range judgment of the American people . Press conference words weighed : Page 19 . By William H. Stringer Chief of the Washington News Bureau of The Christian Science Monitor Washington Vice-President Richard M. Nixon has made perhaps his most impressively alert appearance before the American people in an entirely new political " art form " : an unrehearsed nationwide press conference in which he was interrogated on television by eight newsmen in eight dif- ' ferent cities . In this " cross-country press conference , " Mr. Nixon , poised and fielding every question with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no effort , made these points in answering questions : He urged ' a nonpartisan effort to develop " in our hearts and minds " the will to make the American dream of equality of opportunity , set in motion by the Supreme Court 's desegregation decision , come true . - He said- that the Eisenhower administration had given the majority of the American people " the best ? four years of our lives , " while admitting that pockets of distress do persist , particularly in drought areas . He renewed his attack on Adlai E. Stevenson 's proposal to end the draft , with a charge that in the Korean war , thousands of American . boys were not well prepared for battle and some casualties resulted from this unpreparedness . That will " never happen " under an . Eisenhower administration , he said . ' . Experience Compared He allowed that.Mr . Stevenson is a " well-intentioned man , " but suggested that he did not have Mr. Eisenhower 's experience and judgment . He said the President understood the Communist global threat and had proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress for delay on farm relief and soil-bank payments and natural-resources development under the " partnership " approach . He said that that delay was the best argument for equipping Mr. Eisenhower with a Republican House and Senate on Nov. 6 . Mr. Nixon had just returned from a 15,000-mile campaign tour through 32 states . He had reported his assessment of Republican problems and possibilities in a 45-minute talk with Mr. Eisenhower at the White House . Reportedly , he /-14:1 been optimistic , but had also warned of serious areas of voter disaffection and had urged Mr. Eisenhower to extend his own campaigning efforts . The White House announced that the President would spend an additional day in his Northwest swing through Minnesota , Washington , and Oregon , and that he would ride in a motorcade during his Pittsburgh visit Oct. 9 . It was also hinted that he would make a campaign trip td California . New Technique The Nixon long-distance press conference was quite different from the famous Nixon television appearance of 1952 , with its full-blown sentiment . This time Mr. Nixon was not fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special fund from wealthy Cali fornia donors . This time he was the GOP 's No. 1 political trouble-shooter and No. 2 campaigner , fresh from a nationwide tour , ready to hammer home the p ? . ace-progress-prosperity theme which he has been expounding for the past three weeks . Quick on the trigger , making maximum use of each question lo explain Eisenhower policy , and thoroughly articulate , Mr. Nixon showed television viewers why ' the GOP and Mr. Eisenhower rely heavily on this relatively young man to rouse the party and to carry the campaign battle intensively across the nation . Friendly and courteous , with none of the hard-slugging or dour-innuendo which characterized some of his 1954 campaigning , Mr. Nixon undoubtedly made the most of this nationwide telecast and left a largely favorable impression on those who tuned in . As a novel kind of political stumping the news conference was fairly " good theater . " Due perhaps to careful selection of newsmen , Mr. Nixon encountered no barbed or hooked questions , . no interrogations about his 1954 campaign or his 1950 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
