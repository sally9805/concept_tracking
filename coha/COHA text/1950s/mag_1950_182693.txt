People who were in or near Dayton last April were jolted by loud , explosion-like blasts striking down out of an innocent-looking sky . Most everybody suspected the Air Force , whose nearby Wright-Patterson Field is constantly testing peculiar and violent aircraft . But the Air Force admitted nothing . <P> Last week Daytonians had another sky-side bombardment . This time they got an explanation ; the Air Force had done it on purpose . Before a distinguished audience of scientists and Air Force brass , two test pilots , Captain John C. Newman and Lieut . Harold Collins , climbed their F-86 jet fighters to 43,000 ft. and dived them vertically downward . Pushed by their jets and pulled by gravity , the fighters soon passed the speed of sound . Shock waves trailed in spreading " Vs " from the leading edges of their wings . <P> At 28,000 ft. , the planes pulled out of their dives . The shock waves , increased in force by the turning maneuver , continued straight down to the ground and were heard as explosive bangs . Colonel Franklin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Test Division , explained that a speedboat making a sharp turn does somewhat the same thing . Its normal bow wave , increased by the pressure of the turn , grows into a foaming comber . <P> The Air Force did not reveal the top speed of the diving jets , but it must have exceeded the speed of sound ( 670 m.p.h. at high altitude ) by a wide margin . Some air-wise observers privately calculated that the fighters might have been diving at 1,300 m.p.h. when they made their sudden pullouts . <P> Pilots Newman and Collins needed no instruments , they said , to tell them at what point their diving fighters had passed the speed of sound . When that time came their cockpits grew quiet ; the normal noise of flight abruptly died away . Down they dived in unearthly silence , leaving sound behind , until the slowing effect of the turns brought them back into the sound-filled world .
