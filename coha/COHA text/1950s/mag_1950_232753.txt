Soon after James David MacConnell became associate dean of Stanford University 's School of Education back in 1947 , he began to have callers from the school systems of overcrowded California towns . Most of them were superintendents who " thought they needed more schools or additions but did n't know how to go about getting them . I was struck , " says MacConnell , " by how lost some of them seemed to be . " <P> A onetime school superintendent himself ( in Beaverton , Mich . ) , Dean MacConnell thought he knew how to help his callers out . His scheme : a special School Plant Planning Department at Stanford which would not only aid small communities but would also give Stanford graduate students some first-hand experience in practical administration . <P> 18 Ceilings . By late 1949 , MacConnell had his new department , plus a headquarters " laboratory " of construction and equipment specimens , e.g. : 18 different types of ceiling , five types of flooring , and just about every shape and size of chair , table and desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate students were busy answering calls for help . <P> The first call came from the town of Campbell ( pop . 9,500 ) ; shortly there were calls from Los Altos ( 10,700 ) , Redwood City ( 25,342 ) and Soquel ( school district 4,000 ) . MacConnell &; Co. moved to each town in turn , went to work . <P> Sometimes they merely gave advice on what sort of furniture to buy , what soundproofing , chalkboards or gym floors . In overcrowded towns , they analyzed population trends , decided just how much more space each school district would need to take care of its students properly . In the town of Soquel , for instance , they found that the elementary-school population had risen more than 16% in a single year , that the school had tried to make room for 282 more pupils than it should , and that it had only half the desirable amount of playground space . In Los Altos , the Stanford group recommended a $1,185,408 building program-a recommendation complete down to the last bicycle rack and incinerator . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not stop with recommendations : in some towns they undertook to persuade citizens to vote for school bond issues . They arranged radio interviews , hired airplanes , snapped aerial pictures of likely school sites . In Campbell , they persuaded local merchants to plump for a school bond issue in special ads . <P> Last week calls for help had come in from a town in Utah and another in Montana . MacConnell was looking forward to sending his first teams outside the state . " We 're sure other universities will take up our idea if we do n't move fast , " says he . " We want to get there fustest with the mostest. "
