Of all the universities in Poland , none is held in higher esteem among true scholars-and none is in a sadder state of repair-than the Catholic University of Lublin . Its run-down main building still bears the pockmarks left by World War II shells . Its students live five to a room , and the thin stew they get for lunch could well stand more meat . But as all Poles know , there is one thing that Lublin has in abundance . " Throughout all the difficult years . " says the rector , Father Marian Rechowicz , " we survived on spirit . " <P> The only private university in the Communist world ( it is under the direct management of the Bishop of Lublin ) not only kept itself alive , it also kept alive the last vestiges of real intellectual freedom in Poland . When it reopened its doors in 1944 after the Nazis had used it for a barracks and a hospital , students flocked to it from all over the country , and many of Poland 's leading scholars joined its faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves with the fact that one partially free university was good for propaganda value in the outside world . But if they were never able to kill off Lublin entirely , they harassed it without mercy . <P> Despised Ghetto . By 1950 , hundreds of students had learned what it means to be interrogated by the secret police . Lublin graduates found it increasingly hard to find jobs , and the faculty found it almost impossible to get their research published . The government closed the law school and the department of education . It imprisoned four professors , barred three more from teaching , in 1951 sent popular Father Antony Slomkowski , then rector , to jail . " We were , " says Rector Rechowicz , " a ghetto , an isolated despised ghetto that was allowed not to live but to exist . " <P> In spite of all the pressures . Lublin never really surrendered to the Red regime . It taught Greek , Latin , French , German and English-but not a word of Russian . It was for a time the only university to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not , as one professor puts it , " all class struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat . " Though cautious , many professors found ways to get around the Communists . <P> Says one art teacher : " I did n't care anything for Socialist realism . I brought reproductions of real modern art into my classes , and I said ' this is art and I like it . ' " One historian would take trusted students on hikes , and once safe from being overheard , would deliver lectures as he had in pre-Communist days . Though there were student spies ( " I could always tell , " says one facultyman . " They took notes at the wrong times " ) , teachers and students found subtle ways of communicating . Says a historian : " If I had to refer to the ' Soviet liberation of Poland , ' for example , I would inject a tiny pause or hesitation in my voice before and after the expression . No change of tone-just these little pauses . That meant irony , and every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
