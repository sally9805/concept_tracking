81 The Nixon Children " ' Patricia and Julie Nixon of Washington , D.C. , are two little schoolgirls as American as peppermint ice cream . The fact that their father , Richard M. Nixon , happens to be Vice-President of the United States pleases them moderately but has little impact on their everyday lives . They attend public school , visit the zoo , go barefoot all summer long , and enjoy the Mouseketeers on TV . They could easily be any two children playing in your back yard ; if they lived in your neighborhood , they would be . The Nixons want it that way and intend to keep it so . This is not to say that Mr. Nixon 's position does n't touch his daughters ' lives at all . They know who he is in public life , and they also know that he is a Republican . One afternoon recently , Julie , who is nine , was leafing through a history book and found a picture of Abraham Lincoln bearing the caption , " First Republican President . " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came up with a disquieting thought . " Mother ! " she cried in some horror . " Was George Washington a Democrat ? " Mrs. Nixon explained that Washington was elected before today 's political parties existed , and that , in any case , the important thing about him is that he was the father of the country . Julie was mollified . In newspapers Patricia is called Pat . as is her mother , but her family and friends call her Tricia . At eleven she has a growing awareness of the family 's position and of the difference between public and private behavior . When the Nixons left on a campaign tour last fall , Julie began to whimper a bit as she saw her parents board the plane . Tricia immediately planted herself in front of her sister to admonish quietly , " Not now . " Because the Nixon children are rarely photographed , @#  | except at such public places as airports or at such public events as inaugurations , some people think of them as poor little rich girls , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents ' official duties . Nothing could be farther from the truth . Although their father has done an uncommon amount of traveling since his election in 1952 , he is at home at least as much as thousands of other fathers who are doctors , airline pilots , construction workers , show-business personalities , or military men . When he is at home , he is open and easy with children , not only his own but neighborhood youngsters as well , and he may be found presiding at barbecues or holding a whole lapful while they watch television . He has no set time of arrival in the evening , but whenever Tricia and Julie hear him coming up the stairs in the house , they rush out to him and fling themselves into his arms . Pat Nixon has accompanied her husband on about half of his state journeys . When that happens , Mr. Nixon 's mother , Mrs. Frank A. Nixon of Whittier , California , always comes to stay , much to the delight of Julie and Tricia . Between them and the elder Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most grandparents and grandchildren . " I expect she spoils them quite a lot , " remarks Pat Nixon with a smile . The Nixons have never had to be absent over Christmas or family holidays except once on Tricia 's birthday and once on Grandmother Nixon 's . Gifts were left on both occasions , all wrapped and ready , and a cake was baked and put in the freezer . On Tricia 's birthday , her mother phoned her long distance from Costa Rica , @#  | and when they returned , there was another , bigger cake . Their mother also brings the girls costumes from many foreign lands . As for servants , Mrs. Nixon had never had any regular household help until three months ago ? a source of some irritation to other Washington housewives , who felt her efficiency cast reflections on their abilities . She got up and prepared breakfast and got the children off to school , made draperies and slip covers and some of her daughters ' clothing , cooked dinners , and read bedtime stories . Last May , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-room one they had occupied since they had first come to Washington , they acquired one employee ? a combination cook and general housekeeper . Mrs. Nixon still drives the girls and four other children to school one day a week in a car pool ? the other ( lays they are chauffeured by other mothers ? supervises the girls ' homework , sews , weeds the garden , waters the lawn , and takes her turn at being a Brownie hostess ? a business of supplying cookies and punch for a weekly meeting . Julie is a Brownie ; Tricia , a Girl Scout . Scouting is their only outside activity at the moment , but there is talk cf possib ' -e music or dancing lessons next year . Mrs. Nixon 's current sewing projects are draperies for Julie 's room ( " With pink roses , pu-lease , Mother " ) and the basement playroom and a blue slip cover for the chair in Tricia 's room . Although she employed a decorator for the new house , Mrs. Nixon did much of the planning herself , chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of furniture from the old house . Pat Nixon does this kind of work because she likes to . " I think it 's wonderful to have your own home and take care of it , " she says ( Continued on page 131 ) @#  | simply . " It 's part of living . And I think it 's important for the girls to grow up knowing that women do these things . I do n't suppose they 'll marry rich men . Even if they should , I want them to enjoy being women . " Both girls have certain household tasks assigned to them : They make their own beds and keep their rooms in order , set the table ( not every day ) . and feed the family pets ? Checkers , the cocker spaniel who became famous as a puppy in 1952 when Nixon defended him as a non-political gift , and a variable population of cats , two of them permanent residents . Tricia once solved the recurring family problem of what to do with the kittens in an ingenious way . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KITTENS FOR GOOD HOMES and put it in front of the house . Within an hour all three kittens ? the number at that time ? had takers , each of whom was put through something akin to a congressional investigation of their ability to provide a good home . One of them , an ensign in the Navy , who was later transferred to Formosa , has written to Julie and Tricia once or twice to tell them what a fine big cat the kitten has become and to bring them up to date on the cat 's adventures . Neither of the girls is a tomboy , but Julie is full of energy , bounces around on chairs , pleads an hour before dinner , " Pu-lease , may I have something to eat ? " as if she had n't seen food for two days . Allowed a chocolate-chip cookie , she is apt to corral the entire neighborhood to partake of this treat . She loves company ; after the private inaugural ceremonies at the White House last January , she tried to swoop all the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Eisenhower promptly countered with an invitation for the Nixon girls to stay and play , and , of course , they did . All the children had their dinner on trays in Mrs. Eisenhower 's room and watched a television show . Tricia is not shy but is somewhat more reserved than Julie . Julie adores her and tries hard to keep up with her . Tricia in turn is devoted to Julie and watches out for her welfare . When the younger girl suffered a slight playground injury , Tricia discussed quite soberly with her mother whether the child had received enough family sympathy . There is just two and a half years ' difference in age between the two girls ; they are rarely cross with each other , but when they are , Mrs. Nixon warns them and then announces there will be no TV that night . " Then they are enormously polite to each other for a long time , " she says with a chuckle . Discipline , which usually consists of depriving the girls of a favorite TV program or an afternoon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . @# There are a few clearly stated house rules , so that the girls know what is expected of them and what they can do with impunity . For example , they are n't allowed to romp around the living room ? an elegant room done in beige , blues , and greens ? but they can do anything they like in the playroom , their own rooms , or the yard . One of their favorite games is to dress up in Mrs. Nixon 's cast-off clothing and costume jewelry or in the costumes their mother has brought them from other countries . Julie at the moment loves playing cards , backed with pictures of horses , dogs , boats , or flowers , which she industriously trades with other children . Both of these games make clutter . Another house rule concerns homework : No television is permitted until all homework is done . Mrs. Nixon does n't care when they do it , immediately after school or before or after dinner , but it must be done before they can watch TV . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Nixon explains . " There are just a few rules , and the girls know what they are . I do n't think there 's anything worse than a spoiled child . He 's miserable and so is everyone around him . We try to teach Tricia and Julie some sense of responsibility and some sense of law , because these are essential in a grown person . It 's not so difficult as you might think . Children want to do what is right . It 's partly a matter of setting a good example and , as I say . of a few basic rules that you stick to . That way , they know . " The Nixons do as much as possible together , as a family . They love to go on picnics , and the girls always dine with their parents at home . Julie 's passion in food is spaghetti ; Tricia prefers steak , an item they do n't have very often for the same reason other families do n't : It 's expensive . They have made just one family excursion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then saw a performance of Peter Pan , starring Mary Martin . She had heard they were coming , so she invited them backstage after the show and sprinkled " stardust " a glitter material used in the show ? on two enraptured little girls . No public gifts are accepted , and presents from the family are usually something useful ? clothes ( which they love ) or books , sometimes a game . such as a croquet set . Their playthings are very commonplace : a well-worn Teddy bear , a beloved doll with an arm missing , a set of toy dishes . They each own a bicycle , and they know how to swim and ride ' horses . though they do n't get much opportunity to do either . Julie . in fourth grade , is a voracious reader . and sixth-grade , Tricia likes arithmetic and social studies better . Both are good students ? not scholars ? and they enjoy school . Told they might bring one guest apiece to the inauguration , each unhesitatingly invited her teacher . Of course the teachers came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their homes to dinner , an invitation extended to other pupils , too . Mrs. Nixon hopes the girls will want @# 132 to go to college when the time comes , because , she says , " It is such a wonderful experience , " but that 's a decision they will have to make . Mrs. Nixon , a college graduate , was teaching high school in California when she and Mr. Nixon met . Pat Nixon is n't , after all , a career woman in the routine sense of that term . She is at home with her children fully as much as other women of uppermiddle-income level and social position . She did n't marry the Vice-President of the United States ; she married a man with little money and a beginning law practice . Like thousands of other young wives , she lived through four uncertain years of naval service with him during World War II . She combines a very real graciousness with great good sense . It is no wonder her daughters are two level-headed little citizens . Their mother summed it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apology and without prejudice , " They really are very nice little girls . " THE END @#
