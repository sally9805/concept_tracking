Chaim Weizmann of Motol . Russia , son of Osher the timber merchant and Rachel , stood before the Knesset in Jerusalem , taking the oath of office as Israel 's first President in 2,000 years . In pain , his eyes seeing dimly through cataracts , he stumbled over the biblical phraseology in his Hebrew address , interjected : " I ca n't go on . " But go on he did , to the end of the address and for almost four lonely and physically painful years afterward . One morning last week , a few days before his 78th birthday , his heart stopped , and Chaim Weizmann , the man , died . <P> Chaim Weizmann , the leader , died back in 1946 , when he lost control of the world Zionist organization to the activists led by David Ben-Gurion . He had always opposed violence as a betrayal of the Jewish ethic , but Israel , perhaps necessarily , was born with war as the midwife . Weizmann was brushed aside and became a figurehead , enshrined , for past services , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ming porcelains and modern French paintings . <P> National Home . For half a century before that , Weizmann was Zionism . His vibrant , eloquent voice , lowered for emphasis , cutting deftly through details to the essential , was one of the greatest one-man propaganda instruments in history . He turned even his genius for chemistry into a weapon for Zionism . In 1916 , when British shells began falling short of the target for want of acetone , a basic component in manufacturing gunpowder , Weizmann , working night &; day , discovered a new way of producing acetone in quantity . Gratefully , wartime Prime Minister David Lloyd George proffered personal honors ; Weizmann graciously declined and said : " There is nothing I want for myself . . . I would like you to do something for my people . " He got the Balfour Declaration , which promised the Jews a national home in Palestine-a promise that was to bedevil British consciences for a generation . <P> Like the industrial tycoon who likes to call himself a simple country boy , Weizmann would introduce himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more complex . The man from Motol , who came to England 's Manchester University as a chemistry lecturer at the age of 32 , loved England and English ways . He moved about banquet halls , diplomatic conferences and secret meetings with the aplomb of a great lord , wore an air that had in it traces of Jewish ghetto life , Slavic exoticism and British rectitude . He had none of the frugal , self-denying asceticism of some nationalists . He loved good tailoring , fine linen , good food . He was probably the only President in history with a complete change of clothes in London , Geneva , New York and Tel Aviv . <P> Yet Motol was never too far off . Though Chaim Weizmann was fluent in seven languages , it was in Yiddish that he felt most at home . His humor too was peculiarly Yiddish ; his stories the wry , comic-sad little folk tales that Jews tell to illustrate their precarious position in an oftentimes hostile world .               @ @ @ @ @ @
