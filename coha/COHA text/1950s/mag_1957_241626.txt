Designs for Living <P> SIR : <P> THANKS TO TIME NOV. 4 FOR SHOWING TO THE WORLD THAT DETROIT STYLIST WALKER DOES CARRY IN HIS PRIVATE LIFE ALL THE ARTISTIC NICETIES THAT SHOW IN THE AUTOMOBILES HE <P> DESIGNS . <P> DORIS LILLY <P> NEW YORK CITY <P> Sir : <P> After reading the nonsense surrounding Messrs . Walker , Exner and Earl 's activities , I thank providence for such small favors as the Volkswagen . <P> LEO TOCH <P> Flushing , N.Y . <P> Sir : <P> If a silk embroidered cowboy shirt and a black imported dog reflect the deep thinking of automotive stylists , we can readily understand why the results seen on the American road are as they are . <P> ALLAN H. DEAL BRUCE M. WARNER Berkeley , Calif . <P> Sir : <P> Ford 's " Cellini of chrome " might better be called the Elvis Presley of the automotive industry . His conception of what the buying public wants is insulting , especially to us women . Certainly we are conscious of style , but within the bounds of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions do not meet these requirements ; there is altogether too much emphasis on style and too little on quality and performance . We want to drive the 1958 models , not wear them . <P> DOROTHY C. PIPER <P> Brookline , Mass . <P> Bad Habits <P> Sir : <P> I read your cryptic but perceptive Oct. 28 review of Monica Baldwin 's The Called and the Chosen . I would like to express a few deep-rooted convictions on these notorious " ex-nuns " and " ex-priests " who , through some psychological guilt complex , delight in tearing to shreds the consecrated cloisters and convents they had no right to enter in the first place . As an ex-nun , I am thoroughly aware that anyone can make a mistake about his or her vocation in life . But why , in Heaven 's name , do so many feel impelled to take up a poisoned pen and spit out their venom for the curious and unbelieving to scoff at and ridicule ? I am sure that the God who gave Miss Baldwin the talent to write must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tempted to suddenly appear in human form and ask for Author Baldwin 's autograph . <P> CATHERINE C. MYERS Media , Pa . <P> The Friendly Visitors <P> Sir ' <P> My hat is off to TIME for its polished reportage on the U.S. visit of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip . The visit itself and articles such as yours help to bring a " strengthening of the British-American friendship ties " which the Queen referred to at the President 's banquet . <P> FRED GRICMAN Montreal <P> Sir : <P> I was amazed that you left out the fact that Prince Philip received the first three years of his schooling in an American school at Saint Cloud , near Paris . Here he learned about George Washington long before he knew anything about George1111 and played baseball before he ever heard of cricket . " Those days in the MacJannet Country School , " Prince Philip told me , " were the happiest of my life . " The enclosed picture see cut shows Philip at the school in the fall of 1929 . <P> DONALD R. MACJANNET <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Are you trying to cram Senator Kennedy down our throats via your Oct. 28 issue ? His Jackson , Miss , speech does n't make him President nor does his swimming ( via TV 's Navy Log ) make him a hero .
