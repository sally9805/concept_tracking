txt Charles P. Taft described opponents of the reciprocal trade program as " professional pessimists " today . In so doing he touched off the bitterest wrangle in a month of Senate Finance Committee hearings on H. R. 1 . Patience wore thin , tempers snapped and several committee members left the room in a huff . At times the three-hour dispute was reminiscent of the days when Mr. Taft 's brother , the late Senator Robert A. Taft , was a member of the committee . It served to emphasize the bitterness that is beginning to surround the trade issue as it moves toward a decision in the Senate . Mr. Taft , a Cincinnati lawyer who is president of the Committee for a National Trade Policy , fired the opening gun with a prepared statement . In it he asked that he be allowed to " bring a little sanity into the record " of hearings on H. R. 1 , the bill to extend the trade program to June 30 , 1958 . . Most of the opposition to the bill , he declared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American industries if more foreign imports were allowed to enter the country . " I can not refrain from expressing here my sense of outrage , " Mr. Taft said , " at those who have played upon this kind of natural fear and have induced innocent workmen willingly or unwillingly to flood this Congress with postcards Which carry statements that the prime circulators must know to be lies and who have procured the publication of advertisements , signed by local labor unions , but beyond doubt instigated by the companies concerned , which can only be described as outright misrepresentatiohs . " Mr. Taft declared that when opponents of the program come before the committee " they are professional pessimists and their wails of anguish are heart-rending " " When they speak to their stockholders or to the press the picture is quite different , " he said . He said that injury from im-1 port competition , " when it rarely does occur ? * is no different in kind from injury as a result of domestic competitioii , which happens every day . " He asserted his organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any industry " by a , sudden and substantial reduction I of a tariff . " H. R. , 1 , he said , " is such a moderate increase in the President 's authority that it would I cause no such serious adjustment problems . " Mr. Taft singled out the chemical and bicycle industries to supIport his assertion that some business spokesmen bad talked one way to the committee and another way to their stockholders . Bicycle makers , he said , have Iromplained for years ; that the British were gaining a larger share of the American market . " But up through 1953 , " he deIclared the American companies were making more bicycles and more money  --  over 2,000,000 bikes in 1953 , a record and a steady rise since 1949 . " The chemical industry , he asserted , although expressing fear of the effects of H. R. 1 , put $1,200,000,000 into new plant in 1954 , and now projects $1,500 , - 000,000 for such investment in 1955 . " How does that gee with their pessimism here ? " Mr. Taft demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern about imports , and in 1954 both Dow and Monsanto increased their exports by 25 per cent over the prior year . " Mr. Taft then left his prepared text and asserted that the textile - Pndustry. which testified yesterday against the bill , was actually in very good shape and not suffering from imports . This pro-1 yoked Senator Eugene D. Milli- , kin , Republican of Colorado , a long-time supporter and intimater friend of Senator Taft , to protest . He said witness after witness had come before the committee and testified to injury from Japanese competition . Mr. Taft looked skeptical . " I 'm stating the facts , " he asserted bluntly . " Wait , wait , wait , now , " Senator Millikin said . " No man is wise enough to say he knows all the facts . I 'm assuming Congress looks at the whole situation and decides injury is being done , and then Congress writes in some protection . What of that ? " " Oh , I obey the law , " Mr. Taft remarked , " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We 've had witness after witness ? " Senator Millikin began . " All I 'm saying is that they 're telling you different things than they 're telling their stockholders , " Mr. Taft interrupted . " At least , there 's an average of truth ? " Senator Millikin began again . " I can not agree , Senator , " Mr. Taft said firmly . " I 'm telling you what has been testified --  , " Senator Millikin said . " And I 'm telling you they 're not telling you all the facts , " Mr. Taft replied . " Well , Senator , " sic said Senator Millikip , his face flushing , " that 's a very easy way to dispose of the facts . " Kerr Takes Over At this point , Senator Robert S. Kerr , - Democrat of Oklahoma , took over . He was concerned ) about the effect of oil imports onl independent domestic producers . " The independents a ? e on a thoroughly sound economic basis now , " Mr. Taft said . " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or informed witness that 's come here , do you ? " Senator Kerr demanded . ? " Oh , rich , sir , " Mr. Taft assured " Well , that 's comforting . " Senator Kerr said .. , " I had a kind of ' sense of shock and outrage ' myself when read your statement . " . A. ** when Mr. Taft remarked that the kind of " readjustment " . caused by import competition " is going on every single month and every single year through normal business competition , " Senator Kerr observed tartly : " I think it 's a great blessing for this committee to have before it a human encyclopedia who has air knowledge and . all wisdom . Do you think you 've got a corner on accurate information ? Do you think the committee is capable of getting accurate information from any other source ? " " Oh , certainly . " Mr. Taft said . " But the habit of this committee has been to hear anyone who asked to - appear. and naturally they 've been self-interested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their wails of anguish are heartrending ? ' " Senator Kerr demanded angrily . " That 's a generalized statement which is generally true , but to which there may be some exceptions , " Mr. Taft replied with a smile . " It 's rather lurid language to come from the mouth of a Taft , " Senator Millikin interjected , without a smile . Finally Senator Kerr walked out , muttering something about , " Wo n't be back until he 's finished . ' " Senator Alben W. Barkley , Democrat of Kentucky , also ' left . But both returned before Mr. Taft was through . His dosing moments on the stand were spent responding to questions from Senator George W. Malone , Republican of Nevada , a bitter opponent of the trade program . After Senator Malone had insisted that the program was bad and Mr. Taft had repeated his earlier statements that the program was good , quiet descended and the committee proceeded to hear statements .                  @ @ @
