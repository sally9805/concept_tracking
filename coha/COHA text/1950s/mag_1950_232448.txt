DEBBY ( 304 pp. ) - Max Steele-Harper ( $3 ) . <P> <P> One of the juiciest plums a young writer can pluck is the $10,000 that Harper &; Bros , gives away every two years to the winner of its novel contest . For 1950 the lucky man is a 27-year-old South Carolinian , Max Steele , whose Debby was chosen by a jury of knowing hands : Short Story Writer Katherine Anne Porter , Novelist Glenway Wescott , and San Francisco Chronicle Critic Joseph Henry Jackson . A few of the Harper prizewinners ( Wescott 's The Grandmothers and Paul Horgan 's The Fault of Angels ) were widely and deservedly cheered , but the 1950 winner is not in their class . <P> Debby is the sentimental odyssey of a halfwit . After her husband is killed in the first World War , 35-year-old Debby can not understand that he is dead because there has been no sitting-up , and no funeral and there is no grave on which to put flowers . After being stuck away in an institution for delinquent women for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmhearted Merrills . <P> The Years Go . At first , poor little Debby is nearly frightened to death : she cries for a whole week and wears her big , cape-collared coat to breakfast . But gradually her bruised heart is caressed and warmed by the Merrills , and she begins to feel that at last she has a home . As the years go by , Debby completely identifies herself with the family , listens to young Britt Merrill contemplating suicide because he has failed in school , puts up with the antics of Tomboy Betty , who likes to do anything provided it is mean enough , learns how to get along with high-strung Mrs. Merrill , and gladly forgoes her wages when Mr. Merrill is hit by the Depression . The high point of Debby 's pathetic little life comes when she gets a chance to straighten Rebecca Merrill 's veil just before her wedding , and happily follows the bride all the way to the altar . <P> Together with the routine hoopla of life with Papa and Mama Merrill and their five noisy but insistently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most ingenuous mental operations ever recorded outside clinical notebooks . Theoretically , there is nothing to prevent somebody from writing a fine , compassionate novel about such a mental cripple ; the trap in such an exercise is bathos , and it yawns for Author Steele . <P> " Let Me Go . " Too often , Debby comes through as a cute curiosity instead of a character . She wonders what people do with the breath they save , worries in the morning whether she is the same Debby as the night before , frequently touches herself to be sure that her navel is still in front of her , and is always ready for a good fast game of marbles with the Merrill kids . <P> The story ends with a tear-soaked scene in which the youngest Merrill boy holds Debby in his arms while she dies with the plea , " Let me go .
