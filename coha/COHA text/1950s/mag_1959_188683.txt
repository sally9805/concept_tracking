One of the great purposes of this Administration , wrote Dwight Eisenhower on the eve of his world tour , " has been to advance the rule of law in the world through actions directly by the U.S. Government and in concert with the governments of other countries . It is open to us to further this great purpose both through optimum use of existing international institutions and through the adoption of changes and improvements in those institutions . " <P> So saying , in a letter to Minnesota 's Senator Hubert Humphrey , the President aligned himself with Humphrey 's persistent effort to remove a major roadblock in the U.S. relationship with the International Court of Justice at The Hague . The roadblock : the so-called Connally Amendment of 1946 , under which the U.S. reserves the right to bypass the World Court on any dispute that it considers " essentially domestic . " <P> " I intend , on an appropriate occasion , " the President promised Democrat Humphrey , " to restate to the Congress my support for the elimination of this reservation . Elimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdiction would place the U.S. in a better position to urge other countries to agree to wider jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice . " <P> With such a quiet " great purpose , " which is not the stuff of headlines , the U.S. could contribute to the world a clear and enduring leadership which is not the stuff of Communism .
