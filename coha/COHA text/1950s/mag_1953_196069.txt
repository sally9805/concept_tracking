One morning last week the Russian state radio canceled its regular programs , and for the next three hours droned out details of a great Moscow retreat . It was a 25,000-word document written by Russia 's new No. 2 man , Nikita Khrushchev and it told the hitherto hidden story of Soviet Communism 's failure to provide food for its subject peoples . Items : <P> Although industrial output has increased 230% in Russia since 1940 , agricultural production has risen only 10% . <P> Under Communism , the people are getting even less meat and dairy foods than under the Czar . Russia 's human population has climbed 50% in the past 37 years ( to 210 million ) , but its livestock supply has fallen 2.6% . The hard figures ( in millions ) as given by Khrushchev : <P> 1916 1953 <P> All cattle 58.4 56.6 <P> Dairy cows 28.8 24.3 <P> Pigs 23 28.5 <P> Sheep &; goats 96.3 109.9 <P> Horses 38.2 15.3 <P> Except for bread grains , the report disclosed , farm output " does not fully satisfy the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for raw materials . " <P> Almost as astounding as the blunt confession was its authorship . For the last four years Nikita Khrushchev has been the chief architect of the program whose results he now deplored . He masterminded the agrogorod scheme , designed to further collectivize the already collectivized farmers and to drive them off the land and into agricultural cities ( agrogoroda ) . But by their quiet resistance , Russia 's millions of muzhiks made the scheme a failure , drove Khrushchev into retreat . Result : the new policy grudgingly gives the peasants the right to own more livestock of their own , promises them big price increases for their requisitioned products : over 550% more for cattle and poultry , 200% more for butter , 25% to 40% more for vegetables . " Increase the material interest of the peasant , " Khrushchev ordered .
