Along one outside wall of a $535,000 fieldstone-and-redwood building in Phoenix , Ariz. , the Navajo Sun God gazes impassively from a glittering 67-by-9-ft. ceramic-tile mosaic depicting the sun 's dawn-to-dusk procession through the skies . Around it for the past month has flowed a dawn-to-dusk parade of people and automobiles , drawn by another compelling image : the 12-ft. - high statue of a bright-eyed , chubby child with a brown cowlick , and " Big Boy " emblazoned across his chest . <P> This is " Bob 's , Home of the Big Boy , " one of the newest and fanciest hamburger stands in the U.S. , decorated by Artist Millard Sheets and owned by the big boy of U.S. hamburgers , Robert C. Wian , 41 . Last week , with art and hamburgers drawing record crowds in Phoenix , Wian announced plans for two new drive-ins ( total value : $400,000 ) in California 's hamburger-hungry San Fernando Valley , embarked on a $275,000 expansion program at two other Big Boy outlets in Southern California .

In 1936 Fry-Cook Bob Wian , then three years out of high school , was operating a ten-stool clapboard lunch stand in Glendale , Calif . When a hamburger-jaded customer demanded " something different , " Wian offhandedly carved a sesame-seed bun into three horizontal slices , slapped two beef patties between them , topped with cheese , relish and lettuce . When Wian advertised his Big Boy hamburger on his stand 's menu , sales started sizzling like the brush fires that sear Glendale 's foothills each summer . <P> From two restaurants in 1940 he has built up a chain of beige stucco drive-ins worth $4,000,000 , last year sold 5 million 45 Big Boys , on which " Boyfriends " slathered 38,000 gallons of mayonnaise , 500,000 bottles of ketchup and 25,000 gallons of relish . In addition , some 20 million Big Boys were sold in 1954 by franchised chains and restaurants in nine states and the District of Columbia . <P> Wian , who believes " hamburgers and people are the success of this business , " takes no chances with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round steak ( which is always fried in its own juice ) , picks and trains his employees with equal care . Says Wian : " There are no ready dates on my lots . " <P> Fry Cook at Heart . Greying , trimly mustached Wian , who manages to look conservative in Hollywood-style drape suits , insists he is " still a fry cook at heart . " In 1948 he became California 's second-youngest mayor in a hotly contested Glendale recall election , but resigned after eleven months when his fellow officials proved cool to Big Boyish ideas on city government , e.g. , in a budget-trimming session , he proposed eliminating city library funds for magazine subscriptions , declared : " They want to read a magazine , let ' em go down to the drugstore . " A churchgoing Methodist with a taste for gambling and sport cars , Wian expects his Phoenix stand to be grossing $1,000,000 a year by next July .
