To speed expansion of defense facilities , the U.S. Government granted $30.5 billion in rapid tax write-offs in the last 5 years . <P> Under the plan , a corporation is allowed to deduct the expense of a new unit from its income at a faster-than-normal rate , thus reducing the firm 's tax payments in the early years of the new plant 's operations . Last week a House Government Operations subcommittee took a sharp look at the program to see 1 ) how it is working , and 2 ) whether it should be continued . ( Between June 30 and July 13 , shortly before the investigation began , 40 new grants were issued , covering $47,768,434 worth of new plants . ) The committee was not impressed by the way railroads have been using the write-offs ; it concluded that instead of expanding the size of their freight-car fleets , the roads have been using the write offs merely to replace old equipment . West Virginia 's Representative Robert Mollohan , subcommittee chairman , noted that from Jan. 1 , 1950 to June 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenues of at least $1,000,000 ) bought 310,853 new freight cars under fast write-offs . But they junked 342,287 cars during the same peri od , for a net loss of 31,434 cars . As a result , railroads and shippers are now being badly pinched by a freight-car shortage . <P> Treasury Secretary George Humphrey also was not impressed by the present program . Labeling the write-offs " an artificial stimulus of a dangerous type , " Humphrey asked the subcommittee for a sharp reduction in the use of special tax incentives . When the program began , said Humphrey , the excess-profits tax took up to 82% of corporate profits . But the excess-profits tax has ended , and continuation of rapid write-offs could prevent tax reductions for all taxpayers . In 1955 alone , said he , the Treasury will lose $880 million because of the write-offs . <P> Humphrey was not for complete elimination of the write-offs . But he wanted a program which would grant rapid tax write-offs to produce a defense item available in no other way . Plants that make products which have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , and expand with the market , not under Government stimulus . Humphrey expects the Government to have a new program ready soon " on a proper basis . "
