txt // God , is used by man , but can not be alienated or transferred from one man to another , he might be in a better position to appreciate the chief 's logic . The anthropologist can not share all the premises or fundamental assumptions of the people he studies but he must be able to recognize when people reason from premises which they generally accept . A case similar to the Yao matter of charging rent is reported for the New Guinea Arapesh . Here a man attributed to a chief resentment at having to alienate lands to a newcomer . Ascribing such resentment to another person constituted uncomplementary diversity . It contradicted the premise that people were attached to land rather than vice versa . Men sought to bring the deviant back into line by pointing this out . " . .. People belonged to the land , not the land to the people . . . " ( Mead , 1935:18 ) . Examples reporting the use of logic to control behavior are scarce in the ethnographic literature . Such neglect is certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently studied by anthropologists do not reason or are unable to think logically . Field workers have failed to record instances of such social pressure when they may have observed it . The operation of moral codes , belief in an afterlife , and fear of deities all assume extra significance if one thinks of how they may be applied logically to restrain uncomplementary diversity . When one person warns another that a deity specifically enjoins a certain act , assuming that the community regards the divine injunctions as deserving respect , then that warning can be understood as an appeal to a common premise . The deity 's will , it perhaps is added , should not be violated lest some punishment follow . This brings in the assumption that the deity controls the individual 's future welfare . Therefore , the argument runs in effect : desist in your behavior for it is in contradiction to what we believe is true . Whereas law often is applied by an administration , logic tends to be in the hands of everyone . However , it is often wielded by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : teachers , scientists , philosophers , priests , or theologians . These specialists may be jealous of their prerogatives . In Pakistan during 1956 a commission made several recommendations for changing the law pertaining to marriage and divorce . The members concluded that the values of Islam had to be reinterpreted to become congruent with other aspects of culture . In modern society , they reasoned , many men could not adequately support more than one wife . Hence , polygyny should not be allowed to occur without express permission given by a special court . The commission tried to justify its recommcnda tions by references to the Quran , the Muslim scripture . Theologians ob jected . They not only contradicted the reasoning of the commission 's majority but denied the right of untrained persons to draw conclusions about Islamic matters . // Unequal social change , in which different sections of a community act on different basic assumptions about the world , means that people reason simultaneously from divergent assumptions . One section can not successfully contradict another under such conditions ; for which premises are to prevail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social pressure . Just as the mere threat of law enforcement can insure conformity to legal norms , so the threat of being confronted by contradiction spares the actual imposition of logic . Furthermore , people are able to reason within themselves concerning the logic of some contemplated piece of behavior . Describing how she had to wait on her mother-in-law , kowtow to her , fetch her tea , and wait on her at table , a Chinese wife said : " I was never angry or rebellious about it because it was the custom . ' " Then came the reflexive application of logic to her uncomplementary tendencies ( but the underlying premise remains unspoken ) : " If I rebelled against my mother-in-law , perhaps my mother might have been treated badly by her daughter-in-law ' " ( Ingrams , 1952:101 ) . CONVENTION Convention is a process that seeks to restrain undecorous , rude , and displeasing behavior by invoking shame ( G. Wilson and M. Wilson , 1945 : 57-58 ) . It is applied to acts which reveal emotional expression : speech , painting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeting , and demeanor . ' Convention seeks to limit uncomplementary forms of expression but it does not always reach deeply enough to limit actual feelings or motives . No more is law able to regulate the impulse life , but only the expression of the impulses . In the absence of radical opposition over standards of beauty and decorum , shame compels the nonconformist either to conform or , through social separation , to enter other social relationships in which his behavior will be accepted as conventional . The importance and frequency of shame used as a form of social pressure are revealed among the Hazara people of Afghanistan . " Time and again our informants explained that a man would be ashamed ' to do this or not to do that . Men would be ashamed to kill prisoners in war . " A girl 's father would be ashamed not to give a dowry equal at least to the bridewealth he received and as much more as he could afford . Relatives were ashamed to have an impoverished kinsman marry below his class . Hence they would furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk for fear of the ridicule which such an act . would excite " ( Hudson and Bacon , 1941:251 ) . The Hazara are not atypical in their response to conventional pressure nor is the strength of this sanction to be underestimated . In middle-class America it compels In brief , art ( using the wordvery broadly ) is controlled through convention . // businessmen to wear tics even in hot weather and in India it either kept widows from remarrying or secured their immolation on the husband 's cremation pyre . As with law and logic , the promise of the application of conventional sanctions may be enough to restrain behavior . The student who would like to be careless of grammar and spelling nevertheless follows the rules for fear of what the teacher will say . It has been suggested that legal sanctions rarely enforce norms of sexual behavior ( see pp. 495-496 ) . Sex is an area wherein convention operates strongly . Among the Wogeo , for example , " the adulterer is embarrassed and ashamed , especially if he is insulted in public , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Nor are insults slow in reaching a known adulterer . Among these Melanesian people theft , too , is punished by public abuse of the thief . " Only those who are indifferent to their reputation would commit such an offense " ( ibid. , p. 333 ) . Yet here , as elsewhere , there are some people who can not be reached by the barbs of public contempt . One Wogeo family partly supports itself by theft . People rarely can give an explanation for what they brand as indecent or shameful . Among certain Nuba tribes of the Egyptian Sudan " it would be shameful " for women to tend cows ; no further reason is necessary ( Nadel , 1947:60 ) . But often conventional reasons for adhering to certain norms after a time become rationalized  --  that is , supported by logic . Thus , among the Korongo Nuba if one drank milk drawn by a woman the teeth would break and fall out ( ibid. , p. 61 ) . If this explanation comes to be involved in social pressure ( for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logic rather than convention is indicated . Just as standards of what is decorous , rude , ugly , or improper vary front one community to another , so does the operation of convention . The kissing scenes of American films are hissed off the screen in Latin America . The same audience , however , will complacently sit through a completely nude " art " production ( Kinsey , Pomeroy , and Martin , 1948:365 ) . Lower-class people in an American city are likely to be as scornful of petting ( which substitutes for premarital coitus in the middle and upper classes ) as middle class folk are about a girl known to have " gone the limit " ( ibid. , p. 370 ) . While upper-level males frequently read erotic literature and use erotic pie tures to augment masturbatory fantasies , lower-level males look on such things as the strangest perversions ( ibid. , p. 363 ) . Deeds frowned upon by convention in one community may be enforced by law in another . Or conventional wrongs may , with time , become illegal of illogical ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews the avoid once of pork is largely maintained by convention . Howcvcr , itr modern Israel attempts have been made to limit pig raising by parlimentary law ( New York Times , ) an . 7 , 1c ) 54 ) . // OTHER FORMS OF SOCIAL PRESSURE Law , logic , and convention are major forms of social pressure but they do not exhaust the means which men living in society have devised to restrain uncomplementary diversity in the interest of a stable equilibrium . For example , there is an area of illegitimate pressure by which people more or less surreptitiously try to coerce one another . When workers in a factory slow down production to hurt management financially they may be violating their contract as well as going against direct orders issued by union leaders . A formally organized strike , of course , is legitimate in the United States ( as long as it is not undertaken against government ) and can be considered an expression of law within the group concerned . Public demonstrations and violent riots directed against an administrative or minority group illustrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under prolonged frustration which engenders a high level of stress . Other favorable conditions include the presence in the population of persons with a propensity for violence , highly visible rapid change in social organization , and a precipitating incident that triggers conflict ( R. M. Williams , 1947:60 ) . " The lack of lawful means for resisting the government is indeed a significant feature of despotism . When such means are not available discontented and desperate men have time and again taken up arms against their government . . . " ( Wittfogel , 1957:103 ) . Nations with largescale irrigation works have developed in their implicit charters a " right of rebellion . " In China this right is formulated in the Confucian classics . Informal and quite legitimate social pressure somewhat resembling law is imposed when consumers , perhaps after an unsatisfactory experience with a product , disregard the wares of a certain manufacturer . This may well lead the plant to alter its standards or could drive the organization out of business . Whenever one person refuses to trust or cooperate with another person he may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanction in many communities . Among the Nyakyusa of Nyasaland a very ill-behaved youth may be cursed by his father ( G. Wilson and M. Wilson , 1945:51 ) . Among the Lugbara , living on the Uganda and Belgian Congo boundaries , old men are allowed to invoke ghosts to punish kinsmen who do wrong ( Middleton , 1955:259 ) . Fear of automatic retribution for an action is in itself not social pressure , though it no doubt operates through the reflexive application of logic by a conscientious individual . Fear of being accused of witchcraft , however , constitutes a rather common form of social pressure ( Marwick , 1956 ; see also pp. 641  --  642 below ) . Regulated Conflict Combat restricted to champions , like Australian chiefs in western Victoria ( J. I ) a1vsoi1 , IS , S ! : 77 ) , or carefully regulated fighting between small // groups of men is difficult to classify under any of the usual forms of social pressure . In western Victoria a dispute is sometimes settled between groups of warriors who fight in pairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two disputants face each other , alternately delivering straightarmed blows on the side of the head until one is felled and vanquished ( Hoebel , 1954:92 ) . These and similar forms of regulated combat allow men to settle disputes without recourse to law and in relatively nonlethal fashion . Aggression is allowed to be expressed against the person who cons mitted an undesirable act but remains bound by rules . The rules may even be enforced legally . Psychologically such contests facilitate the discharge of hostility whose unresolved tension would maintain disequilibrium . Or ganized rivalry between dual divisions or wards in a village serves the sank function ( Murdock , 1949:90 ) , and so do games . " A game canalizes po tential conflict . . . by bringing about interaction at high frequency but with the rhythmic order imposed by the technique . Games thus prevent conflict . . . and provide one of the most important means of preserving equilibrium in a society . . . " ( Chapple and Coon , 1942:635 ) . Eskimo song duels allow conventional sanctions to be imposed on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostility ( Hocbcl , 1954:93-97 ) . Such contests are highly traditional and governed by explicit rules . The songs follow a traditional style and their aim is to shame the op ponent . For example , a too assertive woman is censured in the following song : Only now shall I get to hear of such That a woman attacks ! Yes in truth , it is said that you made the first advance , You it was , they say , who made the beginning In that you acted like a man . ' WAR All war is not social pressure . One group may attack and destroy anotlur for wealth , including land . War may also be carried out in order to scctni enemy heads or other trophies with which a ceremony is carried out- ( . ( k erknecht , Nadeau , and Heizer , 1944 ) . Or war may spring from individual motives : men want to raise their rank in the community and are able to ( Id this by winning military honors . This constituted a not uncommon basis ( ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly involve attempts // to coerce the behavior of other members in a society . Our interest is in violence undertaken between groups , tribes , or nations with the aim of forcing one party to restrain or alter its behavior . Civil war , directed by a section of a population against an administration , also belongs in this cafe gory when it is not solely a struggle for office . Economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations or other international administration is rather closet to law than war , but similar sanctions imposed by one or a few nations on one another may be regarded as a kind of war . War Versus Law There are several respects in which war differs from the legal use of force . 1 . Military violence is relatively unregulated . International agreements limiting the use of certain weapons or techniques ( like poison gas ) can not be relied on for the plain reason that as yet there exists no supranational power to enforce such agreements . 2 . War is not undertaken solely against persons guilty of misbehavior . It involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participate in the policy-making process from which a nation 's action springs . It threatens belligerents and nonbelligerents alike . 3 . It is difficult to identify uncomplementary diversity in a culturally diversified society . One nation will accuse another of doing wrong , but the accused party may justify its action in terms of its own standards of conduct . Hence war can not be conceived of as an attempt to restrain generally agreed-upon unwelcome deviance . A violent action by thugs against the police illustrates the character of war , except that the thugs may themselves perceive the uncomplementary nature of their behavior in relation to the larger community . 4 . Normally law is welcome while war is not . The imposition of law is generally welcomed by everybody except the deviant to whom it is applied . War , however , is often and at least ideally regretted by all the parties who fight in it . This is true even when one side fights to end an intolerable situation . Independent Functions of War War is neither inevitable nor an instinctual component in human behavior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used in any culture . Where war is made much of , it may be with contrasting objectives , with contrasting organization in relation to the state , and with contrasting sanctions . War may be , as it was among the Aztecs , a way of getting captives for the religious sacrifices . Since the Spaniards fought to kill , according to Aztec standards they broke the rules of the game . The Aztecs fell back in dismay and Cortez walked as victor into the capital " ( Benedict , 1934:30-31 ) . It is also difficult to prove that wars arc related to the greater readiness for // aggression , learned or otherwise acquired , of one nation compared to another . Wartime propaganda tends to take this line . Some Americans still think of Germany as relatively aggressive in her relations to France and believe that Germans are fond of war . Yet " while the Germans have invaded France three times in less than a century , France , between 1792 and 1813  --  that is , in less than a quarter of a century  --  has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New York Times , Dec. 4 , 1950 ) . There are communities in which organized resort to slaughter never occurs , just as there are people who can not conceive of a lasting state of peace . The Eskimo belong in the former category . The generations of Americans born since 1914 fall into the second . Clearly , however , there is nothing in human nature that predisposes man to violent conflict . This point is strengthened by the data of archeology which reveal that wars have occurred with different frequency at different points in an area 's history . There is no evidence of profound involvement with military conflict in the Middle East before 4000 B.C. Then war becomes progressively more frequent and devastating . The factors behind this increasingly military phase of culture are examined later ( Chapter 40 ) . In Europe evidence of warfare is lacking for the long Stone Age . It is also not indicated during the cultural period when agriculture and animal domestication first entered the continent . But with the onset of the Bronze Age , European man finally came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Such evidence suggests that war is dependent functionally on other aspects of culture . Three general independent functions of way may be cited ( Sorokin , 1944 ) . 1 . Scale . An important factor in war seems to be the scale of the community . A large population , relatively wide in scale , which depends for food , irrigation water , or ore on other parts of the society rarely allows interference with the sources from which or the routes over which these good are obtained . A community that exports to foreign markets seeks to protect its trade routes and to keep competitors out of the picture by war if necessary . Loss of autonomy in wide-scale relations is often followed by an ad ministration 's seeking to bolster autonomy through overthrowing the con queror or by renewed empire building . 2 . Uneven Change . In a society of closely interdependent community . war may follow a fundamental change in the goals or values of one coi community when such a change is not simultaneously compensated for iuthe others . A rapidly rising rate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped to bring on the First and Second World Wars . Technological change , leading to higher energy levels in sonic parts of the society without corresponding changes in of herl s , pal may instigate war . 3 . Radical Opposition . Civil warn often is limn out of tactical opposition and unequal . social change inside a national community . Opposing factions // become aligned with mutually unacceptable positions . The ordinary mechanisms of social pressure  --  law , logic , and convention  --  can not maintain complementary relations . One side then tries to impose its views forcibly on the other in an effort to end the opposition . War may also be a function of national power when it reaches a certain critical level . It has been suggested that whenever a nation in relation to some other country , or combination of countries , reaches a certain level of power " it detonates in spontaneous aggression , even as uranium , which is completely harmless below a certain mass , explodes spontaneously . . . the movement it reaches the critical weight " ( Leopold Kohr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1950 ) . LINES OF TENSION IN SOCIAL RELATIONS War belongs with feuding , sorcery , accusations of witchcraft , and other expressions of hostility that reveal tension in given social relationships . Tension does not occur at random in a society . Often it tends to be related closely to the social structure . Social pressure also tends to cluster around such relationships . Psychoanalysis has pointed out how the structural relationship of the Euroamerican boy and his father tends to be fraught with tension . Both are rivals for the mother 's attention and for other gratifications which she furnishes . Furthermore , the father 's status gives him the right to discipline the son , who , in turn , is expected to show respect for the older man . Among the Navaho Indians tension exists between rich and poor , adults and aged , and between younger and elder siblings ( C. Kluckhohn , 1944 ) . The rich do not distribute their wealth freely enough ; hence they are disliked . The aged have been neglected and resented because they only consume and do not produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghosts take their vengeance . Hence they are threatening . Elder siblings cared for one in youth . In doing so they promoted frustration and are still conceived of antagonistically . Hostility toward the rich , old , and elder siblings often is projected on actual people occupying those statuses . The Navaho Indian will rationalize his own hostility by seeing it as a reaction to the threat of the other . Among the Swazi of South Africa hostility is likely to break out between co-wives , who quarrel frequently and accuse one another of sorcery , as well as between people of rank and power who are mutually jealous of one another ( Kuper , 1947:175 ) . A diviner who can " smell out " sorcery will often select as the guilty person someone in a potentially conflictful status relationship to his client . In the modern world certain international frontiers have long been associated with latent hostility . One of these lines formerly ran through the Middlc East , Balkans , and Danzig hut recently has rowed westward into // Germany . It separates the Soviet and western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Different systems of technology in a community may encourage tensions when the demands of one conflict with the needs of the other . In Lapland the reindeer pastoralists come into conflict with Scandinavian colonists moving north with mixed farming ( Collinder , 1949:22-32 ) . Since the seventeenth century a relationship of mutual dependence has grown up between these categories , but instigations to hostility are not absent . In the fall , farmers ' haystacks , stored in meadows rather than barns , attract reindeer , whose owners then are charged for the damage caused . The herds also damage standing pasture grass . Agriculturalists , encouraged by the government , have occupied lands which the Lapps regarded as their own . This has provoked conflict . Lapp folk tales tell of Lapps being murdered by farmers . Whether true or not , such stories intensify the conflict and maintain a sense of difference between both groups . Conflict between American sheep herders and cattle herders is familiar to readers of western fiction . In 1950 Navaho Indian sheepmen who could not find enough grazing land on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lands were managed by the Department of the Interior but had been leased to white stockmen . Senator Arthur V. Watkins of Utah warned that if further movement off the reserve by Indians continued " there may be bloodshed ' " ( New York Times , Dec. 2 , 1950 ) . 31 . Ritual ' THE reader probably is prepared to think of ceremonial ( i.e. , ritual ) activity as behavior clearly demarcated from everyday aspects of living . Yet he may have heard that in some communities  --  for example , Hindu India or the Muslim world  --  much that the individual does , from the food he eats to his washing and greetings , is ritualized . Ideally it is also expected that a Christian or Jew will live his religion not only on the Sabbath but in nearly everything he does . As a matter of fact , considerably more of the reader 's ordinary day than he may realize consists of ceremonial activity . The present chapter will help him to understand the significance of such activity in maintaining and restoring equilibrium in human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second and third pre-Christian centuries spoke of ritual as the orderly expression of feelings appropriate to a social situation ( Radcliffe-Brown , 1939 ) . To rephrase this , ritual refers to the symbolic expression of the sentiments which are attached to a given situation The term " situation " should be taken to include person , place , time , conception , thing , or occasion . Marriage , death , Christmas , and Easter are prominent ceremonial occasions in Europe and America . A couple of simple instances will show ceremony at work . Upon being received by a host and hostess one murmurs certain appropriate sentiments expressing concern for their health , the weather , or for being late ; dinner is received with spoken or unspoken expressions of pleasure ( at least displeasure is not revealed ) ; upon leaving one expresses gratitude for having been entertained and this feeling is conveyed with a suitable intonation of 5o1 ) // sincerity . At a funeral people weep or otherwise express sentiments of commiseration , loss , and seriousness . " . . . It may be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt . But it is more generally the case that there is no connection between the sentiments felt and the gestures made by the actors in the rite " ( Durkheim , 1915:397 ) . The point , of course , is that the appropriate sentiments for particular situations and their expression tend to be standardized . Recurrent events like meeting a friend , entering another 's home , marriage , death , departure , Easter , and Christmas possess ideal meanings in most cultures . Thus , Christmas is " a clay for the simulation of peace and prosperity " ( Levi , 1947:206 ) . It is these ideal meanings that are revealed in ritual behavior , whether such behavior occurs in passing or as a block of activity  --  for example , a Sunday service in church . Each time such sentiments are expressed they are also reinforced . People who do not feel particularly sorrowful at a certain funeral , or joyous at Easter , or happy to see a guest may nevertheless find such feelings induced in them once they undertake expressions of correct emotion  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , occurs in face-to-face interaction and also can be mediated by letter , floral tribute , or other form of gift . Classification of Ritual Ceremonial may be classified by whether ( 1 ) the expression of sentiments is only incidental to , or dominates , social behavior ; ( 2 ) it is concerned primarily with expressing deference and respects , or ( 3 ) the purpose is to cope with practical problems . Also it can be classified by ( 4 ) the nature of the situation in which it occurs . These are not the bases for an exhaustive or systematic classification of varieties of ritual nor are the classes mutually exclusive . 1 . Dominance . Ritual may be an attribute of an instrumental activity , like walking , making a purchase , eating with a friend , asking for instructions , or allocating people for a task . Even " for a man to speak one language rather than another is a ritual act " in highland Burma ; " . .. it is a statement about one 's personal status ; to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those neighbours " ( Leach , 1954:49 ) . At the oppo site extreme , ritual involves a specific block of activity . A wedding cerc molly , victory dance , the Plains Indian Sun Dance , a reception for a clis tinguished visitor , and the Roman Catholic Mass are in the latter categor . These two kinds of ceremony could be called secondary and primary ritual re spectively. 2 . Rites of Deference . Much ritual behavior , especially when it occurs in the course of ordinary events , is concerned with the expression of pleasure , homage , respect , or similar sentiments iii el personal relations . // Administrators often are treated with profound respect by their subordinates . Among the Swazi , " no subject stands upright when addressing a chief , or approaches too close . When giving or receiving anything , the subject shuffles forward with bended knee and utters exaggerated praise " ( Kuper , 1947:69 ) . In the Indian state of Mandi images of the village deities annually were brought to the palace to offer homage both to the rajah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the rajah and the kingdom were identified ( Punjab Government , 1920:62-63 ) . Consider the following description of a carefully standardized durbar in which the British Viceroy , Dufferin , received the Maharajah of Jodhpore in Calcutta in 1884 . Two important persons are showing mutual deference , although one manifestly receives a little more than the other . A still grander throne than usual was placed for the Viceroy  --  it was a silver one , with large gold lions for arms ; an attendant with a white yak 's tail in his hand stood by , lest a fly should trouble His Excellency 's composure ; a gold embroidered carpet was laid before the dais , and chairs were arranged on either side of it . . . . When the Maharajah reached the door , the Viceroy got up and walked to the middle of the room to meet him , shook hands with him , and motioned him to a chair on his right , while his followers took lower places on the same side . The Maharajah 's dress was green and gold ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a short conversation , " say the regulations , " the Maharajah 's attendants are presented to the Viceroy , and each one holds out to him one gold mohur , which he touches , thus politely expressing " You may keep it though you are so anxious to give it to me . " Then there was another short conversation before the leavetaking . At a signal the Viceroy 's attendants brought in two silver vessels ; one contained attar of roses , the other some very sticky leaves wrapped up in silver and gold paper . . . . The Viceroy puts a small spoonful of attar of roses on the Maharajah 's hand , and gives him a sticky thing to take away with him , ' and they sit down again , while the Under-Secretary in the Foreign Department does the same for his Highness 's attendants , and then they make a final move . The Viceroy again takes a few steps to conduct the Maharajah to the middle of the room , bows to his followers , and they depart with the " same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duffcrin , 1890:I , 19-21 . The respect which administrators normally are shown and the isolation t icy maintain help support their authority . Ritual increases the likelihood that their commands will be obeyed.nThese commands , it may be assumed , function to maintain a degree of social stability . Not only in relations with // superordinates but in any interpersonal situation rites of deference help to preserve a given status relationship and so contribute to stable equilibrium . L3 . Instrumental Rituals . The performance of a ritual itself may be intended to achieve some goal , like the happiness or intercession of an ancestor , fertility , or success in an endeavor . A ceremony of this type may be called instrumental in contrast to one which is carried out primarily for the sake of the satisfactions afforded by the event itself . The latter will be called consummatory or expressive . Consummatory rites do not lack functions . A Kaska Indian potlatch , which is a feast given by one exogamous moiety to another , is not intended to achieve any specific result . Functionally speaking , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , the Hopi Indian Snake Dance , which constitutes an instrumental appeal for rain , serves an identical function for the village regardless of whether it is a reliable means of bringing about a cloudburst 4 . Rites of Passage and of Intensification . Rituals may be associated primarily with individual status change or mark the simultaneous passage of several individuals from one status to another . Initiation rites , installation and coronation ceremonies , graduation exercises , and death ceremonies mark changes in individuals ' customary role behavior . They are rites of passage ( rites de passage ) . Rituals of intensification , on the other hand , tend to be performed at regular intervals and in conjunction with cyclical events in culture . Or they may mark the transition from one season to another . Christmas , Easter , Memorial Day , and the fiestas in a Central American village represent rituals of this type . Functions of Passage Rituals Passage rituals generally occur at a time in a person 's life when he moves from one social position to another . Passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community for the first time , a boy becomes a man , the single person acquires marital status , a woman becomes a mother , a nonleader becomes a leader , and a kinsman is left bereaved . Except for the new leader , these are status changes known in all communities , though they are not always marked ceremonially . The transition from being a warrior to resuming peacetime activities , graduation from school , joining a sodality , and ordination to the priesthood , like promotion to leadership , represent less universal status promotions but they are occasions when ritna I often is conspicuous . The following dependent functions of passage rituals are more or less directly associated with the maintenance of social equilibrium or its restoration after a crisis . 1 . Responsibility is stressed . Passage rituals serve to facilitate the assumption of new responsibilities 1w the person whose status has changed . The // ceremony functions to insure that actual behavior in the new position will be complementary with expectations held for the role . A passage ritual often ushers the individual dramatically into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , even when they are conceived instrumentally , focus the woman 's attention on her forthcoming parental responsibilities . The glowing tributes of a commencement speaker remind the graduating class that a new period of life is at hand.LMarriage ceremonies signal the assumption of new roles , both for the wedded couple and for their former associates . The very elaborateness of the ceremony sharpens the break from one style of life , marked by certain habits , to another . Habit is not always easy to unlearn but the shock of the public ritual presumably facilitates new learning ( Elkin , 1954:166-169 ) . 2 . Familiarity is promoted . Rites of passage help to achieve a smooth working relationship between individuals who have joined in a group . The initiation ceremony of a club , passage Rites , Like the Confirmation Cerfor example , promotes stepped-up emony , Mark the Promotion of Individuals social interaction between the new from One Status to Another ( courtesy , American Swedish News Exchange ) . member and others in the association . The rites familiarize both parties with one another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremonies also can be interpreted in this light for they sometimes help a group , the family , to achieve a new equilibrium following the addition of another member . Among the Korwa of Central India , even before the birth takes place an elderly woman narrates anecdotes concerning the achievements of the ancestor who is about to be reborn ( Majumdar , 1944:44-46 ) . The rite prepares the family for the new member and for the change which its customary relations will undergo when another joins the group . 3 . Readjustment is aided . Death ceremonies and other rituals accompanying a disruption in social relations deal with crucial disturbances to equilibrium . Such rites restore stability to the surviving group by helping its members readjust their relationships . Common elements in a death ceremony may be studied for the way they contribute to this function . The survivors often sing , eat , play games , or dance together . Snell a stepping up of interaction forces the members to become intensely aware of one another ; the // loss is compensated for by extra activity . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are aided to abreact the emotion they feel , to release their tension . Such release , too , facilitates resumption of equilibrium . Where people have certain prescribed roles to play in a ceremony they may be enabled publicly to assume the new status conferred upon them through another 's death . In general , the more important the status of the deceased ( measured in terms of the number of people with whom he was in direct , indirect , or mediated interaction ) , the more elaborate will be the funeral arrangements . The death of an infant is marked by little ritual attention but a king 's passing ceremonially disrupts the whole community ( Levy-Bruhl , 1928:209  - -  211 ) . The very disruption of life is a symbolic expression of his importance . The prolonged rituals provide millions of people with a chance to express their loss . At the same time they dramatize the importance of the royal status . In executing the latter function the ceremonies help the successor to maintain authoritative administration . 4 . Solidarity is enhanced . Status changes disrupt the relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , if our theory is correct , accompanying ceremonies act to inaugurate a new period of relative stability . It is likely that joint participation in such rituals strengthens the bonds linking the actors . One way in which this comes about is by confronting the participants with common social values . The ceremonies stress the value of events like birth and marriage , or of important statuses . The community jointly affirms that these things are indeed valuable . Common social values , like common interests in general , symbolize and reinforce the unity of a group , making it better able to withstand threats to stability ( Rad cliffe-Brown , 1939:151 ) . Functions of Intensification Rituals In general terms , cyclical or calendrical ceremonies provide regular op portunities for relatively intense , harmonious , and pleasurable social interaction between people around subjects of social value . To this extent ritual , of passage and intensification overlap . In both types social values are pail forward prominently and function to promote solidarity . The following : specific points amplify and illustrate this more general proposition . 1 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doing pleasant things together reinforces solidarity in a group . The things people do during the ceremony heighten the pleasure they feel in being together . Christmas parties with their food and drink , factory and and church picnics with their games and annual dinners given by sodalities are examples in point . Such affairs create anew a feeling of belonging ( Ulan , 1955:132 ) . They increase tolerance for unavoidable future vicissitudes and strains in social living . Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners promote colic. // sion in the kindred just as unilinear kin group or local group rituals strengthen social bonds in those groups ( Radcliffe-Brown , 1952b:Chap. 8 ) . In assessing such functions for a ceremony it is obviously of the greatest importance to know the group or groups which are participating . 2 . Status relationships are activated . Recurrent ceremonies provide periodic opportunities to activate superordinate and subordinate relationships . Such exercise contributes to the maintenance of the status system and to equilibrium as far as that state hinges on a given system of status relationships . Among the Chukchee of northeastern Siberia the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have returned to the forest from the tundra with the family reindeer . They deliver the animals to the father , their legal owner . The ceremony reaffirms the father 's control over the beasts , which for an extended period of time were in the control of the children . The whole family enters a new equilibrium with the start of winter ( Chapple and Coon , 1942:509  --  510 ) . 3 . Values are reiterated . A ceremony of intensification is often directed to remembering , honoring , or worshiping certain ideas , objects , deceased heroes , or values . The spirit of patriotic sacrifice is commemorated on Memorial Day in the United States ( Warner and associates , 1949:Chap. 16 ) ; God is honored by the congregation on Saturday or Sunday ; the founder of the country is remembered on his birthday ; the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier ( note the ritualistic use of capital letters ) is the scene of ceremonies . What do these targets of ritual have in common ? For present purposes it is sufficient to point out that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ritual affirms its unity around these important things . / The emotion canalized toward flags , images , or dead heroes also intensifies solidarity Ideas in radical opposition to the social value ( e.g. , ideas opposed to military preparedness ) will have difficulty in diffusing in the community . The significance of the regularity of such ceremonies should not be overloo Ced . Regularly people intensify their value system . They are not allowed to forget the sacred elements of their culture . However , there is danger in the very recurrence of ritual . The very habitualness of the experience ma deprive it of emotional strength and so weaken its functional importance . 4 . New adjustments are achieved . Rituals of intensification often occur in conjunction with alterations in the seasonal cycle , with the passage from clay to night , or with the change from one technological system to another ( land to ice hunting among the Eskimo ) . Such transitions , although regular , arc also associated with upsets in equilibrium . The people change their behavior and customary interaction patterns . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as among the Chukchcc , children return from the tundra . Family members now will be associated in different activities . PcrIwlx they will he together more in the house as the season of field work // comes to an end . All such changes demand that new equilibria be estab- lished in human relations . Rituals help to achieve those states . Other Functions of Rituals 1 . Patriotism is enhanced LThe function of ceremonies in promoting a sense of identification with the community ( or group ) as a whole is especially important under conditions in which segmental loyalties add a centrifugal pull to the forces making for overall organization Rituals honoring the nation , its past , those who died in defense of its freedom , or honoring the sovereign , symbol of its unity , function to overcome religious and ethnic group divisiveness . They override struggles between management and labor , rich and poor , and competing philosophies or value systems . In some acephalous segmentary tribes of Africa ( for example , the Tallensi ) each segment possesses crucial roles in a cycle of rituals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosper . Thus the ritual quite directly helps to maintain a mutual sense of awareness and interdependence in an organization without political controls ( Gluckman , 1955a:128 ; Fortes , 1945 : Chap . 7 ) . 2 . Conflict is avoided . Often a ritual consists of one person 's avoiding another ( see pp. 522-524 ) . While this may be a means of showing respect or recognizing superordinate or subordinate status , a function more directly related to equilibrium is revealed in such expressive action . When a Pakistan youth avoids shaving or smoking in his father 's presence he avoids open signs of competition with his father ; a man who avoids his mother-inlaw among the Kaska or Apache Indians is unable to jeopardize the equilibrium of the matrilocal household through incestuous relations with that woman ; a Kaska father who avoids his married daughter and son-in-law again avoids competition , this time with the head of the new nuclear family . 3 . Tension is reduced . Ritual may involve a letdown in customary avoidances , conventions , or norms . People are allowed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitute disturbing instances of uncomplementary diversity . Such ritual license reduces tension . " These rites of reversal obviously include a protest against the established order . Yet they are intended to preserve and even to strengthen the established order " ( Gluckman , 1955a:109 ) . To start with a simple example , the demurral shown by a bride allows her to abreact the ambivalence felt at the impending status change . She is not fully prepared to assume the new responsibil ities . The marriage ritual allows her to act out the negative as well as the positive sides of the transition . Among the Zulu people of South Africa women are legally , if not actually , subordinate to men . This snhordinaI ion is expressed ritually in the rule that women dress as women and t hat t hey shall not herd milk cattle . Yet there formerly occurred a reversal cereiuuiw // at which women dressed like men , carried weapons , drove the cattle to pasture , and milked them . " . . . Performing these normally tabooed actions is a reward and release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules serves to emphasize them . Therefore ritual license helps to protect the community from deliberate or unthinking uncomplementary diversity during the normal course of events . Swazi ritual abuse of the kingship , when that status is normally highly respected , offers another illustration of license , one that can be interpreted by the same reasoning . " . .. There may be high psychological catharsis and relief in the princes and subjects who are required thus publicly to express hidden resentments . . . . To act the conflicts . . . emphasizes the social cohesion within which the conflicts exist " ( ibid. , p. 125 ) . 4 . Evil is suppressed symbolically . Rituals of purposive expiation , purification , or reintegration may be used after a crisis . They function to remove the ripples of a disturbance and to reinstate equilibrium . In an Assamese plains village , " equilibrium . . . is greatly disturbed by an occurrence of illegitimate sex relations . In order to remedy the irregularity the offending parties must invite all fellow members of the khel section . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1954 ) . The ritualization of legal proceedings may be understood as having similar functions . The punishment is somberly declared , its justness is emphasized , and the community is assured that a matter has been dealt with effectively and appropriately . 5 . Anxiety is allayed . Rituals allay anxiety and therefore maintain personal adjustment , a factor on which interpersonal adjustment depends . The reassurance of prayer , the promise of rain contained in a Pueblo Indian masked dance , and the promise of health suggested in the confident procedure of a Navaho singer curing a patient all contain this anxiety-allaying function . Among the Nyakyusa , when a man dies he goes to join his ancestors . Until the end of the funeral rituals he is on his way . If the ritual is not properly performed he never reaches the ancestors but troubles the dreams and lives of the survivors . " If you do not perform the ritual for your father or mother you may go marl or else have a slow and lingering death ' " ( M. Wilson , 1957:18 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote confidence or does the very ritual promote anxiety that might not otherwise have appeared ? 4 A synthesis between the two theories of ritual in relation to anxiety has been suggested . Un the first place , people normally try to cope with anxiety-producing situations . Rituals are used or created to meet this aim . The ritual is not used so much to relieve anxiety as to cope with the problem that aroused the insecurity ( see pp. 624-628 ) . Nevertheless , the ritual promotes assurance . Failure to do something in the face of // the situation would probably be followed by a perceptible rise in the level of anxiety . Ritual does n't create the stress , but failure to carry out the rites probably would be stressful . COMPONENTS OF RITUAL Once their constituent elements have been examined , ceremonies cease to be the esoteric phenomena that they sometimes appear to be . Basically a ritual consists of one or a combination of the following components : ( 1 ) technical manipulations of the physical environment , including the human body , ( 2 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( 3 ) avoidances , ( 4 ) material objects which possess symbolic or , at least , strong emotional significance , and ( 5 ) collective representations . It is possible to extend this list to include music , dramatization , relatively special forms of speech , and even personality dissociation ( trance ) as elements of ritual . However , the five components mentioned above and discussed below are the most common and will suffice for introductory purposes ( cf. Honigmann , 1953c ) . , J It should be noted in the material which follows how the expressive aspect of ceremony , the key feature of ritual , actually is contained in the component elements of the ritual . The more varied these elements , the more scope to express sentiments bound up with the situation . A handclasp is a simple form of expressing welcome or of graciously terminating an actual interpersonal relationship . But how paltry it is compared to a ceremony that includes decorated streets , flag-waving crowds , a massed band , the presentation of bouquets of flowers , and a banquet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or farewell . Ritual Techniques Ceremonies often prominently feature the manipulation of human bodies or things : a tip of the hat , a genuflection , the consumption of food , washing the hands , building or putting out a fire , imitating fighting , killing an ox , or almost anything else . Some ( but not all ) such ritual techniques represent relatively commonplace techniques transposed from everyday l i f e into the ceremonial context . Cutting the hair , for example , may mark a child 's introduction to the community but the same technique also is used for comfort and adornment . One normally walks to get somewhere but also there is ritual walking , as in processions . Hindus tie cattle to stalls to keel ) them from straying but they also tie the bride 's dress to the groom 's gat ments to symbolize the couple 's unity . People slaughter animals for meat but they also do so as an offering to an ancestor or deity . Thereafter they may cat the flesh . Often the commonplace process is performed with heightened care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // How do techniques come to be selected for inclusion in a ceremony ? How do they function in the ritual context ? The selection of a technique as a ritual element may be related to one or a combination of the following factors . 1 . Symbolic Properties . The technique , often by virtue of its ordinary context or use , serves well to symbolize some analogous idea associated with the ritual . For example , washing is associated with physical cleanliness . In the ritual it often symbolizes another kind of cleanliness  --  a putative cleanliness of the soul , mind , or heart . Sexual intercourse is known by most people to be associated with conception and reproduction . This makes it a convenient vehicle for symbolizing crop fertility . Where people seriously entertain the premise that like produces like , such ritual techniques may be used instrumentally , that is , to achieve a given end ( seep. 627 ) . 2 . Pragmatic Utility . Actors in ritual often wish to move from place to place ; hence , they adopt an available technique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also , people engaged in extended ceremonies become hungry and eat . No matter what additional symbolization may be conveyed by these acts , they are also to be understood from the standpoint of their simple , pragmatic utility in the ritual situation . 3 . Attention-Getting Value . The expenditure of energy , care , or wealth in the course of performing a technique calls attention to the ceremony and enhances its importance in public estimation . The slaughter of a valuable animal emphasizes the importance of an occasion or , perhaps , of the target ( deity or ancestors ) to which the act is directed . " Everyday is not Id , " says the Pakistan Muslim . " We do n't eat turkey every day , " says the American , stressing the special significance attached to a particular holiday on the occasion of which spectacular things happen . Cleaning the house or village prior to a ceremony also serves to express the importance of the forthcoming event . Drawing attention to a ritual in these ways in turn helps to insure other functions attached to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may afford pleasure , even while it symbolizes something or draws attention to the occasion . In this sense the technique can make the entire ritual a pleasurable event and this in turn contributes to whatever dependent functions it supports . Singing , eating , drinking to excess , and dancing are techniques whose presence in ritual can be understood in the light of this hypothesis . The pleasure-giving value of ritual techniques also contributes to the persistence of the ceremony over time . People come to look forward to the holiday , perhaps more to its pleasurable aspects than to its ideal meaning . 5 . Emotional Abreaction . A technique sometimes provides a means for releasing tension or strong emotion during the course of a ritual . Running , Weeping , and mutilating the body are examples . Their presence in certain rituals  --  for example , those occurring on the occasion of death  --  should he // understood in the light of this property . The abreaction of certain emotions ( e.g. , grief ) may be of fundamental importance for promoting personal adjustment after a crisis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over which the disturbance endures . Sometimes techniques persist in ritual after they have been displaced from everyday life . The burning of candles and the use of horse-drawn transportation are examples from European and American cultures . Everyday techniques may also be abbreviated or tokenized in the ritual context . Communion represents token eating ; washing the fingertips in the Mass is a form of abbreviated washing . If the technique is used symbolically it need not be entirely performed in order to achieve its purpose . A few ritual techniques will now be examined to see how they operate and contribute to equilibrium . The techniques which loom largest in world ceremony consist simply in manipulating the body . Through these manipulations meanings arc expressed symbolically . The nearness of God , an important social value , is brought out in the raised hands of the benediction . Deference to an officer , an act which maintains a given system of status relationships , is shown iii the salute . A closed group may be emblemizecl by a special handshake ; using it contributes to the solidarity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningful only if their conventionally assigned meanings have been learned . // Eating is a ritual technique which , because of its association with intimate familial relations , often symbolizes newly established intimacy . It does this when the bride and groom eat together . To offer food also indicates making another person welcome and this in turn strengthens the bonds of interpersonal solidarity . Eating , which manifestly signifies ingestion , may also be used to portray the assimilation of a quality or intangible entity  - -  like God . Often the significance of eating in a ceremony demands knowing the meaning of what is consumed . Cannibalism may express devotion when the body is that of a kinsman but may show degradation when it belongs to an enemy . Spitting and vomiting less frequently are incorporated in ceremony . Among the Swazi of South Africa a king affirmed his authority by spitting fertility " medicines " over his land ( Kuper , 1947:80 ) . The act signified the kingship and its vital importance . Zionist churches in South Africa administer ashes as an emetic , vomiting symbolizing purification ( Sundkler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value , the vomiting links people who belong to the same congregation and also stresses the importance of the collective representation to whose worship the congregation is dedicated . Social Interaction Since much ritual occurs in social situations , social interaction is almost invariably a part of that behavior . Here , however , attention is drawn to the fact that the socially standardized expression of sentiments often is accomplished through having people interact with one another in a prescribed , arbitrarily meaningful fashion . A greeting between , two friends is the simplest instance of ceremonious social interaction . Somewhat more elaborate is the announcement that a status change has occurred made by the Aymara headman when he visits each household head in the community and there takes a drink with the host ( Tschopik , 1946:540 ) . Congregations meeting at regular intervals to worship under the direction of a specialist minister exemplify another type of ritual interaction . Entertaining one 's kindred at a wedding reception , presenting gifts to relatives-in-law , and leaving a calling card at the ambassador 's residence are other forms of direct and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for example , by a junior to relatives who are older than he or who have authority over him  --  is ritual activity ( Homans and Schneider , 1955 ) . Sometimes familiarity and teasing are standardized between certain relatives . When such behavior occurs between a man and his wife 's sister , for example , it provides " a socially acceptable channel for expressing ... aggression along with sexual impulse .. . . " ( Murdock , 1949:282 ) . The aggression derives from the way in which the claims of Ego 's wife and her sister 's husband frustrate sexual intimacy between Ego and his wife 's sister . Joking which is somewhat rough , // and at the same time suggestive , carries off the aggression and simultaneously allows discharge of the sexual impulse . Spectatorship often constitutes an important element in ritual . Such passive interaction allows a ritual cynosure , like a sovereign , bridal couple , or initiated youth , to advertise its importance or a newly assumed status . Spectatorship with applause is a way of showing honor . Furthermore , spectators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way insure the dependent functions of the ritual . Government employees in Washington , D.C. , may be given time off from work in order to greet a visiting foreign dignitary . Passive participation in ceremony is directly related to largeness of scale . In small-scale communities it is far less important than it becomes in association with high population density . In much of the modern world millions of people can participate passively in a ceremony through the radio , television , press , or documentary film . Rituals often include devices which insure that each participant will meet every other or will have a chance to interact with the principal person in the situation . Reception lines and the custom of calling out the names of guests as they arrive accomplish this function . The use of alcohol in ceremonies intensifies the pace at which people interact with each other . The euphoria promoted by liquor presumably intensifies the bonds of solidarity in the group . A number of rituals , especially those associated with passage from one status to another , involve the temporary isolation of a participant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some weeks before her marriage . In Africa youths being initiated into an age grade or into the ranks of men spend some months in a bush camp cut off from their families . During this time they are referred to as having died . Their return to the village signifies rebirth . Isolation focuses the attention of the individual on the transition he is undergoing . By being removed from customary social interaction he is better prepared to assume a new role following the ceremony . Finally , the community is given warning to interact with the person in terms of his new social position once the seclusion period is ended . Isolation also stresses the importance attached to a ritual occasion and thereby helps to guarantee whatever other functions the rite possesses . The periodic sequestration of the menstruant in some communities not only expresses the danger postulated to inhere in her condition but effectively prevents her from coming into contact with other people whom she might pollute . The sequestration , therefore , serves directly to guard against uncomplementary behavior . Avoidance Enough has been said about avoidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 49 ) to permit only quick recapitulation of how this act , // when it is expressive of the significance attached to another person , operates with respect to equilibrium . The avoidance may isolate certain kinsmen between whom there exists potential conflict or between whom sexual relations are forbidden . Avoidance prevents conflict over who will originate action to whom . The Kaska Indian father tends to avoid his daughter after her marriage ; therefore he is not likely to come into conflict with her husband 's authority . When certain people are avoided , the action also helps to maintain social distinctions . For example , members of one caste separate themselves from members of another . To keep the castes distinct , in turn , insures the perpetuation of the division of labor that is predicated on the caste system . Distinguishing , on the one hand , between the primarily ritualistic avoidance of impersonal objects , places , or acts and , on the other hand , matter-offact avoidances ( like not getting one 's feet wet for fear of catching cold ) is difficult . Ritually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( But remember that ritual expressiveness is a matter of degree ; any action can reveal the significance residing in a particular occasion . ) In the other kind of avoidance an actor is trying to cope with a problem : not to get sick , to be successful on a hunt , to avoid punishment , to cultivate a rich yam harvest , not to offend a deity . However , in the communities anthropologists often study , many ritual avoidances also are designed purposefully for coping . The ritual avoidance of some food , certain acts , or objects requires functional explanations different from those which have been assigned to interpersonal avoidances . Some ritual avoidances in the former category may be adaptive in quite direct fashion and thus contribute to equilibrium . For example , the avoidance of pork may help to reduce the incidence of fatal trichinosis in a population ; the Eskimo rule against sleeping at the ice edge reduces the danger of a hunter 's drifting off on a dislodged floe . But many avoidances remain unaccounted for if only adaptive functions are sought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual activity during the ceremonial period ; Catholics avoid food before going to the Communion table . Such avoidances , closely connected with larger rituals , function to enhance the importance of the ceremonial occasion . They stress that something of great significance is about to happen or is under way . Therefore they reinforce other ends of the ceremony . Other impersonal avoidances are not bound up with larger ceremonies . Among the Eskimo things from the land and from the sea must not be brought into contact . A Nepalese king never leaves his kingdom to visit another country ; if he did so his dynasty would not prosper . Some people avoid the names of the dead ; other communities do not use the proper names of parents but refer to these people by the name of an offspring cknouvmy ) . It is best to look for the explanation of such relatively specific avoidances in the particular cultural context wherein they occur . Gen524 THE WORLD OF MAN orally , however , the following very general function may be suggested : Avoidances create or maintain social values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequent resistance to disequilibrium . Anything can become a social value by being treated with respect or avoidance . The very avoidance , if strenuously insisted upon , becomes a paramount , unifying ideal in the culture . Avoidances pertaining to administrators deserve special comment . They increase the social visibility of the occupant of the status , reinforce the likelihood that his policies will be followed , and so safeguard the equilibrium functions dependent on his role . Avoidances limited to members of a clan , association , or religious sect possess closely analogous functions . They too promote greater visibility at the same time that they set off the group from other groups in the society . The function would seem to be enhanced in-group feeling . This , in turn , also is conducive to social continuity and increases resistance to disruption arising from disequilibrium . Material Ritual Specifics The meaning of rituals and their appeal often is made more vivid through certain artifacts , perhaps objects used more or less in their natural state . Such objects , through the meanings they possess , are capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a national flag , the Ark in a synagogue , the host in a Roman Catholic Mass , the Sacred Pole of the Omaha Indians ( Fletcher and LaFlesche , 1911:229 ) , and the Churingas by which Australian natives remember events of the bygone Dream Time when ancestral heroes walked on earth . The reverence with which such objects are treated ( the Sacred Pole was spoken of as though it were a person and was preserved in a shelter ) indicates and reinforces the degree of emotion they are capable of arousing . Material ritual specifics also serve as targets of ritual  --  that is , the ceremony is directed toward them . Often , it would seem , this occurs with the idea of reaching invisible referents for which the artifact stands as a symbol . Among many Plains Indians skin-wrapped objects , called ceremonial bundles , stood for a certain aspect of the universe . The bundles were cherished by Keepers , who acquired their status through a vision , by purchase , or from birth . Rites were addressed to the bundle but are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the universe . The bundle acted as a medium in such a relationship . Bundles persist among the Seminole Indians of Florida as well as in other American tribes ( W. C. Sturtevant , 1954 ) . Material ritual specifics often consist of modeled human or animal figures symbolizing invisible postulated beings who are believed to control certain aspects of experience . It is pointless in this general treatment to list exhaustively the kinds of things nice associate with ritual . A few examples should give an adequate // conception of the range of material ritual specifics . Corn pollen is a widely used specific in the southwestern United States , where a pinch of the stuff touched to the ' lips and thrown to the sky may promote a blessing ( Reichard , 1950:II , 509 ) . Corn meal is no less important in the same cul- ture area ( ibid. , pp. 540-541 ) . Beverages often possess profound expressive value : tea in Japan , India , and Pakistan ; beer in Africa ( E. J. Krige and J. D. Krige , 1943:287-288 ) , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremonies of the North American Indian church , belongs in the same category ' Cattle have a wide use in African ceremonialism ( Herskovits , 1926 ) . Among the Tonga of Northern Rhodesia they were killed to celebrate the emergence of the girl from puberty seclusion , during mourning ceremonies ( the number proportionate to the importance of the deceased ) , at rain shrines to ward off drought and pestilence , and to indicate the legal conclusion of marriage ( Colson , 1951 ) . Vestments play a // large part in the church rituals of Euroamerican culture , the color and designs often bearing symbolic meaning . The colors by which holidays like Chanukah , Christmas , and Halloween are marked can be considered ritual specifics just as can the Christmas tree . A special place among ritual specifics may be reserved for human beings honored in ritual . " . . . In the present day just as much as in the past , we see society constantly creating sacred things out of ordinary ones . If it happens to fall in love with a man and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspirations that move it , as well as the means of satisfying them , this man will be raised above the others and , as it were , deified " ( Durkheim , 1915:212-213 ) . Sovereigns and heroes are examples . Ritual specifics contribute to the appeal of the ceremony or help to fix its meaning in concrete terms . They are conditioning stimuli that trigger appropriate feelings , the very feelings that are supposed to be experienced in the ritual situation or that the ritual is supposed to express . In this way ritual artifacts do their part in accomplishing the more general functions dependent on the performance of the ceremony . The variety of ritual specifics is a direct index of the elaborateness of the ritual life of a community . Generally speaking ( and despite occasional puritan tendencies to reject such objects ) , the profusion of ritual specifics keeps pace with scale , technical development , and cultural elaboration in general . Great wealth may come to be bound up with ritual specifics and numerous specialized craftsmen be kept busy supplying them . Collective Representations Often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to postulated entities  --  gods , spirits , or bygone heroes . Perhaps the people affirm their dependence on the will of these forces or , like the Navaho Indians , seek to compel the collective representations to act in a manner favorable to man . In many communities of the western world the collective representations are historic personages who are commemorated regularly by the group . They stand for the unity of the organization . Collective representations are among a community 's most important beliefs . They are the master symbols which justify given values or a particular system of social organization ( Guth and Mills , 1953:276-277 ) . Their stabilizing influence is clear . B &-; cause they are often beyond rational questioning or doubt , and because the values people follow in social relations are backed by the collective representations , the latter concepts do much to preserve group life on an // even keel . They forestall disequilibrium , especially radical opposition . Rituals periodically remind a group of the collective representations and so maintain the emotional valence of the latter .

Communication PRACTICALLY all interpersonal activity depends upon communication . Broadly speaking , communication includes all those procedures by which one person produces a change in another 's behavior . This chapter , however , will be concerned exclusively with communication in which one person more or less deliberately seeks to reach a recipient with a message . There is , however , no intention of limiting communication solely to the successful transmission of intended information . Offer a message is not received with the meaning it is supposed to convey . The teacher setting forth facts , the senator on the Senate floor urging his colleagues to see a public issue his way , a package of frozen fish emblemized with a trademark , a propaganda poster caricaturing the enemy as evil , a highway marker warning the motorist of a curve in the road , an orchestra playing Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony , and a painting in which a painter expresses his conception of reality are all examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disc jockey on a quiet February night ( Anonymous , 1955:27 ) : And while all the thoughts were being compiled and all the words were being put down on 3 X 5 file cards a few typewriter ribbons were being changed and occasionally someone took the time to oil the fielder 's mitt there were things to be written , things to be said and things to be done and there was a quiet Monday night , February , 1953 a few people were listening a few people were looking a few stars were being watched a few moons were being examined a few sand dunes were being understood as , in fact , had ever been understood in their brief period of sitting before all the elders .

In writing , the spoken sounds of language arc expressed in graphic signs . Finally , some communication may have no direct relationship to language . Music , traffic signals , railroad 52 , , S30 THE WORLD OF MAN semaphores , and dance which tells a story or portrays emotions illustrate nonlinguistic communication ( Sapir , 1934a ) . SIGNS , SYMBOLS , AND OTHER ELEMENTS Any form of communication may be studied on two levels . One may note the way in which the technique is executed  --  for example , how music is made with instruments or how the speech sounds of languages are produced by the vocal organs . Such an approach constitutes an aspect of technology ( see pp. 290-291 ) . This chapter will deal only incidentally with the technical aspects of communication . The major interest will be on communication as it involves agreements between people concerning the value , significance , or meaning of the elements used in the communication process . In studying linguistic communication interest will be devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the significant units of verbal communication and how their combination is governed by rules or agreements . Signs and symbols are two important elements in the process of communicating facts and feelings in social situations . Both point to referents that may be objects , relationships , or states . That is , signs and symbols refer to other events . The deep bow which a subject makes to his ruler refers to the respect he feels ( or is supposed to feel ) ; his signature on a contract refers to his promise to act . The distinction between a sign and a symbol can be given succinctly by saying that a sign is designed to prompt an automatic response , whereas people respond to a symbol after no matter how short a period of reflection or thought . A red traffic light is a sign of potential danger if presented in its normal situation , an intersection . People who have learned the meaning will respond by stopping , and proceeding when it turns green . In Pakistan the sound of a muezzin calling the faithful to prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people respond automatically without understanding the Arabic words he utters . But a poem is different . The words , each a symbol , give information to which the response is not automatic . Understanding increases as a poem is reread . New significance comes to be found in the use of words or in the skillful use of metaphor . A sign , then , is designed to evoke action in relatively direct fashion whereas symbols enable one to conceive of other things . The same words or other stimuli may serve both as signs and as symbols , depending on whether they are intended to evoke overt behavior directly or encourage concept formation ( Langer , 1942:Chap. 3 ) . Animals can learn to respond to many signs but they do not seem to be adept in grasping , say , verbal or written stimuli symbolically . A clog may jump up and look for the family cat on hearing the word " Puff " but Ile probably does not form a concept of a generalized cat . Unlike a house // wife , the dog would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of frozen beef . The only way to teach him to respond to a picture is regularly to associate the image with food so that the picture becomes a sign of food to follow . For most shoppers the picture of the steak is symbolic of prime beef , of succulence , and of the consideration that a man will appreciate when he comes to dinner . Communication , however , involves other elements than discrete signs and symbols . A tone poem , like Sibelius ' Finlandia , does not , like the word " Finland , " point to a referent . Even less does a Mozart concerto suggest specific meanings apart from itself . The communication of music , therefore , appears not to involve either signs or symbols . ' At a theater the audience reacts not only to words ( symbols ) of the playwright , or even to the whole drama which constitutes a carefully organized system of symbols , but also to the quality and skill with which the words are spoken and the cast conducts itself . Such elements as quality and skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or symbol . Now , an actor 's role and a symphony orchestra 's rendition of Sibelius or Mozart certainly arise from the signs or symbols in the playwright 's script or the composer 's score . They also depend on the signs and symbols made by the director or conductor . But the rendition also communicates by virtue of the skill used in rendering the performance . The audience responds to that skill and to the general manner of execution . Blocked communication occurs when the originator of a communicative act and the person supposed to respond to it in a certain way fail to perceive the same meaning or value in the signs and symbols or in the manner of their execution ( A. M. Rose , 1956:44-48 ) . The stranger does n't understand the legend " Pay here " or misinterprets the word " Private . " The person with a certain set of values finds no satisfaction in T. S. Eliot 's The Waste Land or in the stories in True Confessions . Blocked communication also occurs when somebody simply fails to receive messages containing information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , may not learn of conditions in his organization on which the formulation and execution of policy closely depend . Immigrants may not receive information which facilitates their adjustment to the host community 's culture . Members of one social class may fail to learn the values and ideals of another . Blocked communication induces stress , creates misunderstanding , and leads to interpersonal conflict . No community could tolerate the wholly free flow of communication ( cf. Chapter 27 ) . What is important is whether the information reaching // the recipient is adequate for his adaptive and adjustive needs ( Jaques , 1951:302 ) . GENERAL FUNCTIONS Successful communication of information is basic in maintaining the operation of any group , organism , or machine . Mechanical and biological communication , however , is of no particular interest at this point . The question to be examined in this section is how social communication conditions human adaptation , adjustment , and stress . In the main the discussion will refer specifically to linguistic communication , although what is said also applies in general to other kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( see pp. 817  --  818 ) means that he can not survive unless he learns adaptive behaviors from other individuals who similarly have acquired such knowledge . As a community 's degree of technical development increases , the volume of knowledge grows enormous , though , of course , no one American has to learn antisepsis , surgery , safe driving , wheat cultivation , how to shield himself from too great exposure to x-rays , and how to prevent the earth from losing its lifepreserving fertility . However , know-how for carrying out all these adaptive skills is transmitted only through communication . Adaptation depends on social organization  --  on cooperation , collaboration , and occupational specialization . But it is communication that brings people into partnership and , more important , holds them there even after strains and other evidences of disequilibrium appear . The function of ritual in maintaining social solidarity has already been discussed . Ritual consists overwhelmingly of communication . Social organization periodically is threatened by uncomplementary diversities ; life itself is threatened directly by violence or aggression . Social pressure relies on communication to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication is seen whenever a person who is troubled is helped by another individual , like a priest or psychiatrist , who manipulates signs or symbols . Aid may be derived from a cross , words used in prayer , or words which furnish a psychodynamic interpretation of anxiety . To communicate feelings of grief , anger , or jov also contributes to a more stable state for the individual . Rituals often promote such equalization by providing opportunity for the social expression of emotion . Difficulties or misunderstandings between people which complicate living together arc overcome through communication . // Social equilibrium , on which intrapersonal adjustment in turn hinges , depends heavily on communication within the group . ( 1 ) Communication circulates the information on which the goal-oriented behavior of a viable instrumental group depends . Norms of behavior , how to perform techniques , and when to report what to whom must be communicated for an organization to operate successfully . ( 2 ) Communication in a group contributes to equilibrium when the basic values , including faith in the ultimate goal , that keep people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) States of disequilibrium when they appear can be dealt with after they are made known to responsible administrators of the group ( cf. J. R. Firth , 1950 ) . Stress Communication is employed to create or cement existing relationships but it also serves to intimidate or confuse people in social organization and to disrupt group life . This is how the process operates against an enemy in wartime . When certain kinds of information are blocked in whole or part , the blockage may foster disequilibrium and stress . Failure to understand the meaning , or to appreciate the value , of information may weaken cooperation or encourage a sense of frustration . Man 's capacity to use symbols ( see pp. 816  --  817 ) also imposes on hint a special vulnerability to stress which other animals are spared . Such stress occurs when linguistic symbols , words , are treated as the equivalent of the things they represent . People react to the word as though it were the referent . To accuse somebody of being a Communist endows the person thus symbolized with all the vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The actual behavior of the person thus designated is of little significance when words are used in this way . Many words ideally stand for empirical differences in the world being described . But differences may exist in behavior which have no corresponding differences in language . Referents may crop up in language which do not in fact exist in experience or are hard to locate . Language used in these ways leads to muddled thinking ( Thouless , 1953:Chap. 7 ) . A patriotic orator in a short space of time may convince his audience that " Russia constitutes a threat to world peace . Russia with its atheistic ideology is a threat to freedom-loving and God-fearing men . The Russian brutality in Hungary indicates the caliber of Soviet international policy . " Does the word " Russia " stand for the same referent in each of these sentences ? What is the referent ? An area of ground ? All the inhabitants of European Russia ? All the citizens of the Soviet Union ? Only some inhabitants of the Soviet Union ? Or does " Russia " refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as an organization of people under government ? Clearly the word is not being used very precisely if the reader has trouble // in deciding which of these referents is indicated . Yet the United States is preparing to fight a strategic war in which , if it becomes necessary , long-range bombers will be sent across Soviet frontiers to destroy life on a relatively grand scale . Russia , of course , is prepared to do the same . Such vagueness in linguistic communication has been called a " direct threat to our sanity " ( Walpole , 1941:67 ) . Many semanticists are devoted to the task of making people more conscious of such " defects " in the way language is used . But it still is true that visitors from another planet might accurately report that The race is one of those which use ( in this case orally ) discrete Invariant symbols , recombination of whose elements Can in no sort of circumstances be complete Or even sound as descriptions of real events . The poem ' ( at which this , in the biped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integration of symbols which may be defined As a semantic composition fusing what is thought and dreamt , And working in senses and thalamus as well as what is called mind . That verse ' is better than the race 's thought as a whole . In general practice they reify abstractions ; at The price of wars , etc. , fail to keep symbols under control . Robert Conquest , " Excerpts from a Report to the Galactic Council " ( The Listener , 1954 , 52:612 ) LINGUISTIC COMMUNICATION The greatest proportion of communities studied by anthropology concentrate communication in language . In a large-scale nation , like the United States , face-to-face linguistic communication still remains important but a large volume of information is also put into circulation through extra-linguistic media like printing , telegraphy , or radio . Like any other form , linguistic communication may be described by the kind of conventional agreements that are involved or by the way those agreements are executed in practice . This yields a distinction between language and speech ( la langue and la parole ) . What linguists call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the flow of the spoken word . I ai uagc ( la langue ) constitutes a vast number of unconsciously made // agreements . These include agreements that some sound units ( phonemes ) will be significant and that certain combinations of sound ( morphemes ) will be meaningful . The combination wii plus na in Cree designates the third person singular ( " he , " " she , " " it " ) but in English " wiener " ( often pronounced wii'na ) designates a frankfurter . The sound units in this utterance significant to a Cree or English speaker are , approximately , /w ii n/ and /a/ . Such agreements between speakers of a language exist despite the fact that only rarely are they codified in written grammars or dictionaries ( Laird , 1953:Chap. 1 ) . Tremendous diversity marks the way in which individual members of a community actually use language . Within the implicit agreements on which understanding depends , no two people speak precisely the same way ( i.e. , use the same idiolect ) . The essence of language is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast number of sounds that man can potentially produce and , second , to assign , quite arbitrarily , certain combinations of those sounds to certain elements of experience . Learning a language in practice consists in uttering the significant sounds in approved fashion and connecting combinations of them with the experiences to which they are supposed to refer . Thus the name " Professor Richard Smith " refers to a specific individual but " 1957 Ford , " " house , " or " book " refers to a class of events ( i.e. , objects ) , the range of the class being quite wide . The words " between , " " by , " and " into " point not to a class of objects but to relationships between events . Technically speaking , speech ( la parole ) consists of communicating by means of voluntarily produced , significant sound units . There is nothing instinctive about this process , although the capacity to use language undoubtedly rests on an organic basis ( see pp. 815 , 845 ) . Speech sounds are largely produced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( hard and soft , the latter being the velum ) , nose , tongue , and lips . IIowever , other organs of the body also come to be involved . Although they may be referred to as " vocal organs " it is obvious that the parts of the body commonly used in speech also possess other functions . The process of speaking consists of expelling a relatively continuous column of air from the lungs and disturbing that column while it is still in the throat or head . ( A few languages also include sounds made by inspiring air . ) As already illustrated , speech sounds may be classified by the manner in which they are produced ( Tables 6 and 7 ) . Whether language or speech is considered , linguistic communication is certainly , by the definitions adopted in this book , part of culture . The point is raised only because there has been some tendency to speak of " language and culture , " as though they were separate systems ( Voegelin , 1951 ; 13ittic , 1952 ) . // Families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which genealogical connection can be traced belong to the same language family or linguistic stock . ' Such languages are derived from a common parent language whose forms can often be reconstructed ( see pp. 102-103 ) . Linguists do not agree concerning the number of language families in the world . Some of the world 's major families are listed and identified in Table 36 . While families tend figure // t o be localized continentally there is nothing to prevent any language from being carried to any part of the world . Within . families , then , languages are distinguished . Speakers of the same language constitute a maximal speech community even when they are not contiguously located . t'hc largest speech community of the world is that comprised of Chinese speakers , of whom there arc 480 million ; then come English ( 265 million ) , ; 111 ( 1 Russian ( 2 ( 10 million ) . // A language usually contains several dialects . The speakers of a dialect speak more like each other than like speakers of another dialect . In comparison to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dialect community is more highly localized . Dialects often form when a section of a larger speech community , speaking a more or less uniform language , is isolated , with the result that innovations enter and become fixed in the language . Should the process continue long enough a new language will come into existence . In other words , dialect differences are relatively small and language differences are greater . Not all dialects of a language are mutually intelligible , however . The Cockney English spoken in London is not too easily understood by a person from Brooklyn , and an American Southerner will have trouble making himself understood in Pakistan . Contiguous dialects , however , are mutually intelligible . Social class cleavages also correlate with differences in speech . In Washington , D.C. , a study indicated that 70 untrained judges listening to short tape recordings of the speech of Washington Negroes could gauge the social level of the speaker accurately . " Persons who grow to adulthood as members of an underprivilcgcd social group may carry a mark of their origin through life and suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the lower socio-economic classes " ( Putnam , 1954 ; see also O'Hcrn , 1954 ) . To quote from My Fair Lady , such speakers may literally be " condemned by every syllable they utter . " Expressions like " the King 's English , " " Standard English , " and " Espanol correcto " indicate that not all constructions of a language are regarded with equal tolerance . Conformity to one , presumably more correct , form is often valued ( Entwistle , 1953:63 ) . Use of the more highly valued form of the language commands greater prestige and tends to be correlated with highcr social rank . Teachers use social pressure to induce conformity to the standard form . But sometimes the experts themselves disagree concerning what is correct . Recently some linguists have reacted to the idea of a correct form of language in a startlingly radical manner . They claim that except for the practical difference speech habits make ( for example , in getting a job ) , " there is no such thing as good and bad ( or correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in language " ( R. A. Hall , 1950:6 ; cf. Carpenter , 1957 ) . " A dictionary or grammar is not as good an authority for your speech as the way you yourself speak . " Words do not have any real ' meaning as opposed to other false ' meanings . Any meaning people give to a word is automatically its real meaning under those circumstances . " All languages and dialects are of equal merit , each in its own way . " When languages change they do not decay ' or become corrupted ' ; // a later stage of a language is worth neither more nor less than an earlier stage " ( R. A. Hall , 1950:6 ) . In areas containing several , mutually unintelligible , speech communities , one of the languages , perhaps in a more simplified form , may constitute the language of intercourse . Swahili in West Africa is such a language , or lingua franca . The language of intercourse may be a new language , one blending the vocabularies of several others . Pidgin English ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malayo-Polynesian grammar with vocabulary derived from German , English , and other languages , including some native to that region ( R. A. Hall , 1955a and 1955b ) .3 The movement to make Esperanto a lingua franca is analogous to the creation of Pidgin except that it is being deliberately fostered . Communities with occupational specialization of labor encourage the appearance of specialized forms of language . That is , language comes to contain lexical items or constructions appropriate to the task at hand and emblemizing a group or a category . The East Greenland Eskimo shaman , who acts as the medium for invisible entities , uses special words when he refers to ordinary objects . For example , in his argot wind is called " breathing , " earth the " great darkness , " and man , " that which resembles a shade " ( Thalbitzer , 1930:76 ) . The so-called criminal castes of British India were equipped with quite elaborate argots ( Crooke , 1896:1 , 215 ; IV , 187-189 ) . Adolescent slang , the technical terms used in anthropology , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , IIenriques , and Slaughter , 1956:214 ) illustrate argots . Basic Principles A few basic facts about language , most of which have at some time or other been contradicted , are worth stating explicitly in order to avoid misunderstandings . 1 . Language is universal . Except for occasional mutes and similar exceptions , there is no community which does not use language . There are no people so small in scale that they can not transmit information linguistically . Not only is language universal but it is also very old . Witness the large number of language families in the world that can not be genealogi-figure // cally related to one another . Divergence between these families has gone so far since their probable common origin that all resemblances between them have disappeared ( I Ioijer , 1956:198 ) . 2 . Language is learned . It is now generally accepted that a normal child will , by the age of about 5r , learn to speak the language of those people who rear it . No person is born with inbuilt patterns of speech . But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another . Baby talk may be used with children before the regular language is learned . Among the Papago Indians a special child form of the language is used during the first five years . In some communities children grow up acquiring simultaneous mastery of several languages . Although certain sounds are easier for a child to pronounce than others , there is no evidence that any language is easier for children to learn . For the adult , who comes to learning with fixed speech habits , the situation of mastering subsequent languages is usually more difficult . In large-scale communities the individual , as he changes his job and group or assimilates new words through the press , radio , and film , continues to learn language throughout his life . In a smallscale community , however , " once adult status is reached , the range of adult experience is relatively fixed and unchanging : the language of the adult likewise remains static " ( M. M. Lewis , 1948:45 ) . 3 . Language is relatively autonomous in culture . Compared with other areas of culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language possesses a large degree of independence from other sectors in the cultural system . Language is an exception to the generalizations made earlier about the systematic nature of culture . However , autonomy is not characteristic of vocabulary . The lexical store of a language manifestly reflects the activities , interests , and values of the members of the speech community , and changes in it keep pace with the rest of the culture . But apart from indisputably distinct dialects and argots , as far as fundamental grammar is concerned , there really is not much difference between the English spoken by a Wall Street banker , the American adolescent , and the underworld criminal ( Levi-Strauss , Jakobson , Voegelin , and Sebeok , 1953:30-31 ) . Some food-gathering Navaho Indians , wandering south from the New World homeland of the Athapaskan language family , adopted agriculture , sheep herding , and elaborate ceremonials but did not change the fundamental structure of their language . Athapaskan in Arizona and New Mexico is still Athapaskan as it is spoken in Alaska , Yukon Territory , and the Northwest Territories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become simpler as the overall elaboration and degree of technical development in culture increase ( Chapple and Coon , 1942:578-580 ) . But such a tendency has by no means been demonstrated clearly . 4 . Languages can not be compared in terms of relative efficiency or // adequacy . An Oxford University professor advises that " ... if one wants to get closer to primeval or primordial languages , it is advisable to study savage and barbarous language processes " ( Entwistle , 1953:19 ) . Anthropologists have found no reliable way of establishing what a barbarous process of language might be . How can it be proved that the language of the Australian Arunta is closer to early forms of language than , say , English ? Spoken languages always are changing . The stock of vocabulary items in the language of a very small-scale , exotic community is just as comprehensive as French , English , or Latin . The sounds of the language may strike the speaker of English as peculiar but let him be assured that English sounds are equally strange and hard to form for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task it has to do . It is adequate for communicating information about elements in culture or significant portions of the cultural field . Change the culture or the field , and people will have to coin or borrow words to deal with the new experience . The Turks had no word for " secular " when they began to westernize their culture ; they borrowed one from French . French and English colonists had no ready word for the American Indian 's footwear and so borrowed his word , " moccasin . " Many other examples of problems similarly met by numerous languages could be cited . Some evidence suggests that communities using the same language differ in the degree to which they will create new words . Australian speakers of English arc exuberant improvisers compared to Americans ( Pei , 1953:159 ) . But such creativity probably is related to other personality factors and can not be a function of the language itself . 5 . No language can be translated perfectly into any other . Yet , and this is equally important , a message expressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other language . In other words , languages are equivalent , functionally speaking , even though each is specialized for different kinds of experience . There are three kinds of translation ( C. Muckholm , 1949a:156 ) . First , one word may be substituted literally for another . This is an impossible task when the same words do n't occur in different languages . Gemuetlichheit has no precise English equivalent nor does Cree Niinanaan  --  " we , " in the sense of I and one or more absent third persons ( as distinguished from I and you-who-are-present ) , ( cf. pp. 406-407 ) . Second , the official type of translation allows certain idiomatic equivalents in one language to be accepted for certain words in another . English " God " is rendered hitchiimanitu in Cree by Roman Catholic missions ( see pp. 657-659 ) . Third , there is translation in which words are sought which will produce the same effect in the second language as in the original . This kind of translation is very difficult . How can the Japanese association of cherry blossoms with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered in English without copious and cumbersome footnotes ? // 6 . Living language is always changing . Linguistic change occurs in ( a ) grammar , ( b ) phonetics , ( c ) vocabulary , and ( d ) semantics . ( a ) Grammatical constructions like " it 's me " and " everybody should take off their hat " ( replacing " it is I " and " everybody should take off his hat " ) are becoming increasingly used in American speech . However , the English speech community is less ready to tolerate these usages in written forms of the language . Writing is often more conservative than oral expression . Normative-minded grammarians frequently deplore and resist such modifications and are often successful , at least as far as concerns the standard language . ( b ) Guardians of language also may seek to control phonetic shifts in language , like the shift from Middle English " acre " ( rhymes with " rocker " ) to modern " acre " or the ongoing change in " forehead " to rhyme with " horrid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change . From English the Cree Indians borrowed the greeting watch ( " what cheer " ) , and English in turn borrowed " moccasin , " " moose , " and other words . From Arabic English has derived " admiral , " " alcohol , " " coffee , " " lemon , " " magazine , " " orange , " " sherbet , " " sugar , " and " zero " plus many others ( Walt Taylor , 1933 ) , which accompanied the diffusion into Europe of the objects or experiences to which they refer . These Arabic words diffused long enough ago to have had time to become quite well assimilated to the phonetics of English . Hence they no longer sound foreign . " Courage , " from the French , has been more completely assimilated than " rouge " from the same language and both more so than vis-a-vis . The Zuni joking rebuke to an awkward person suuca 7intiyan ( " such an Indian " ) is also fairly well assimilated ( S. Newman , 1955:351 ) . World-wide diffusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop an international vocabulary for those areas of culture . Since the borrowed lexical elements are incorporated into different grammatical systems , however , they are not bringing about a truly international language ( Whatmough , 1956:Chap. 4 ) . Vocabulary change through origination apparently is rare , not unlike discovery and invention in general . In English there is resistance to coining new words . Nevertheless , physics has had to coin many names to designate newly discovered fundamental particles . Words like " libido , " " defense mechanism , " and " Oedipus complex " are also originations . Attempts to purify a language of foreign words may lead to substitutive originations . Thus Germans replaced die Stenographie with die Kurzschrift ( E. H. Sturtevant , 1917 ) . It may be questioned whether " defense mechanism " and Kurzschrift are really originations since they merely compound existing lexical forms . However , they do correspond to similar processes of recombination in other areas of culture ( see pp. 195-196 ) . Linguistic displacement may occur when a community , // sensitive to some area of experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will then be replaced , temporarily , by a more innocuous term . " Toilet " became " water closet " and finally " bathroom , " " john , " or simply " w. c . " ( Laird , 1953:63 ; cf. Nadel , 1954a ) . The many words for death probably arose in the same way . Origination is encouraged in vocabulary referring to a focus of culture ( see pp. 128  --  129 ) . d . Over time words lose , or acquire new ( added or substitute ) , meanings . " Jazz " once referred to sexual intercourse and not to a form of music ( Laird , 1953:64 ) . Some semantic change occurs through generalization . " Tap " once meant only to draw liquor from a barrel by means of a bung . By generalization it has been extended to cover drawing upon any resource , even on a man 's talents ( ibid. , p. 56 ) . 7 . A word means what it does in a social situation . The relationship of a word to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience . No word is naturally better suited than any other word to designate a particular event . There is no inherent reason why a clog should be referred to by the linguistic form " clog . " And , of course , this animal is n't always referred to by that term but by der Hund , le chien , atim ( Cree ) , and kingmiq ( Eskimo ) . Even in the case of onomatopoeia , words are merely suggested by nature and are not an outgrowth of it . Since the relationship of words to experience is arbitrary , meanings can be altered readily . In fact , word meanings constantly do change . Therefore , it would be foolish to rely on an early-eighteenth-century dictionary for contemporary meanings . It is also not very reliable to depend on a current dictionary for all dimensions of meaning . A word seldom has the same meaning when it is used in different situations . " Be prepared " has one meaning when used as the Boy Scouts ' motto , another when issued by a teacher expecting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wartime poster . The dictionary gives only the most generalized , or core , meaning . Except for variants , it scarcely suggests the ease with which new associations can be added or old ones displaced . Dictionaries constantly must be revised in accordance with the instability of meanings . Editors collect many illustrations of a word appearing in different contexts . The definition finally published will be based on the different usages ( Entwistle , 1953:241 ) . Functionally speaking , the meaning of a word resides in the work it does . To ascertain the full meaning of any communication it is useful to know the status of the person uttering it , with what motivatiorr as well as iii what situation it is spoken , and what response it evokes . The utterance " We forgive those who trespass against us " assumes quite distinct meaning when it is known that these words are used ritually by church congregations on Sunday morning . Few people , knowing this fact , seriously would expect members of the congregation to forgive a business partner // or a grocer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the fact that people refuse to acknowledge the relativity of meaning ! How Languages Are Built Readers already have been introduced to the two minimal units of significance and meaning , the phoneme and morpheme respectively . 1 . Phoneme . The significant sounds of a language , variation of which alters meaning , are called phonemes . ' For example , varying /p/ to /b/ in English " pin " definitely refocuses the word on a different class of objects . In Crcc , however , the voiced labial stop , b , is not a phoneme distinct from the unvoiced labial stop , p . Substituting one for the other changes nothing in a word like apuu , " the **26;95;TOOLONG . " Phonemes as such have no meaning but they are significant in the process of conveying meaning . Segmental and prosodic phonemes may be distinguished . In the former category arc English /p b u and i/ and many more . Levels of intonation , tone , or stress ( for example , the rising voice when one asks a question ) are prosodic phonemes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Languages can be described as differing in the number and kinds of phonemes used . ' Chiricahua Apache possesses 31 consonantal phonemes and 16 vowels . These are shown in Table 37 . In comparison Greenlandic Eskimo possesses only 3 vowels ( high front /i/ , high back /u/ , and low mid /a/ ) and the semivowel /y/ . In addition there are 14 consonants , as shown in Table 38 . English has a total of 45 phonemes . " There are 9 vowels represented in the words " pit , " " pet , " " pat , " " fist , " " cut , " " hot , " " put , " /o/ as in New England " coat , " and the vowel of British or eastern New England " hot " or midwestern " sorry . " In addition there are 3 semivowels : /y w and h/ . There are 21 consonantal phonemes : /p t k b d g/ ; /c/ , the initial sound in " chat " ; /j/ as in " jet " ; /f/ ; /0/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in " shoe " ; /v/ ; /0/ as in " then " ; /z/ ; /z/ as in " azure " ; /m n/ ; /u/ as in " sing " ; /1 r/ . Now come the 12 prosodic phonemes . There are 4 stresses in English : primary , secondary , tertiary , and weak ( each of which is indicated by a suitable sign ) . They are respectively illustrated in 4 syllables of the phrase " lighthouse keeper " ( one who tends a lighthouse ) . There are 4 juncture phonemes . Internal juncture normally occurs between words and is illustrated in the compound " night-rate " as contrasted with " nitrate . " Terminal sus- // figure tained juncture is indicated after the word " crowded " in : " The bus was so crowded that we took a cab . Would n't you ? " Terminal falling juncture is indicated after the word " cab , " and terminal rising juncture is marked by the interrogation point at the end of the utterance . Finally , English contains 4 pitches : low , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicated by appropriate numbers as follows : ' I said 3no ' . 3No3 ? 3That 's ' right ' . 4No ' . Some variations of sound in a particular language are irrelevant to mean- figure ing and therefore do not represent phonemes . Whether an English speaker utters the vowel in " pin " to rhyme with " bin " or " bean " is nonphonemic . Other variations in the vowel are equally insignificant as long as they do n't come too close to the vowels of " pen " or " pan . " In Cree substituting b for p in apuu likewise is irrelevant . These nonphonemic variations are the stuff out of which personal variations in speech ( idiolects ) are derived . They also appear when one speaks hurriedly or under stress . The insignificant variants of phonemes are allophones. 2 . Morpheme . A morpheme is the smallest element in language which possesses meaning . " Is , " " the- , " " small , " and " - est " are morphemes of English . Some morphemes may be used alone ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not make sense unless used in larger constructions . " The " and " - est " are examples of bound morphemes . In some languages , like French , Algonkian , and Eskimo , most of the morphemes arc bound . In English and Chinese many morphemes are free . Languages of the latter type are sometimes called isolating , in contrast to agglutinative and polysynthetic languages that allow a rather large amount of wordbuilding ( Bloomfield , 1933:207-208 ) . For example , in Eskimo " I make boots " is kamiliokpurja ( from kami- , " boot " ; - liok-  , a bound form indicating the process of manufacture ; and - purla , the first person singular pronomial suffix ) . Allomorphs are analogous to allophones . Morphemes that differ in form but have the same meaning , like -s ( in " boys " ) , -z ( in " dogs " ) , and - iz ( " roses " ) , are allomorphs of the same morphene . This morpheme may be designated by any one of the allomorphs . Whichever one is chosen is usually placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as prefixes , or as suffixes , or may be inserted into a word . A bound form may consist merely of some modification of the constituent phonemes  --  for example , the change of vowel from " goose " to " geese . " 3 . Larger Constructions . In linguistic communication morphemes are combined into larger utterances according to patterns called grammar . ' Grammar may be defined simply as the way morphemes are used in order that they will convey enlarged meaning ( Laird , 1953:35 ) . It is a way of putting together ideas in linguistic communication to make those distinctions in experience that a speech community finds significant . Grammar enables speakers of most languages to fix the relative time of an action , specify the actor and the object acted upon , or indicate that the statement is about an incident that occurred or did not occur . Grammar is by no means // the normative concept which the reader has learned it to be from the way it is taught in many schools . For a linguist grammar does not specify what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey meaning linguistically . It represents the pattern of what they actually do with morphemes when speaking or writing . It is the pattern of the implicit agreements that people follow when they use language . As such , grammar is not fixed but , like the rest of culture , always changing . A person speaks grammatically when he uses the morphemes according to the patterns obtaining generally in his speech community at a given time . It is in connection with grammar that " parts of speech " enter the picture . Free and bound forms are used in different ways . In English some free forms are nouns and others report the actions of nouns , i.e. , verbs . This is an example of categorizing morphemes according to the way they work in larger utterances . All languages contain more than one so-called functional class of forms but not all languages possess the same classes . Early studies in comparative linguistics tried to impose the form categories of Greek , Latin , and English on every language . But these categories do not apply to other languages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islands ( Table 39 ) . This has only three form classes ( R. A. Hall , 1950:97  --  100 ) : ( 1 ) There are forms to which the personal possessive suffixes ( signifying " my , " " thy , " and " his " ) may be attached . ( 2 ) There are forms which can not take the personal possessive suffixes , but the owner can be indicated by prefixing the phrase ao , meaning " my property " or am , " thy property . " Thus the form " suffering " becomes ao mddak , " my suffering " ( literally " n1y-property suffering " ) . ( 3 ) Finally , some forms are substitutes for forms in Ilse previous two categories . ' Hwy can alsgbe used before a fond of IN lies 1 and 2 to identify the actor . These are the most familiar // morphemes to a speaker of English , who would call them pronouns . Some Marshallese pronouns occur in two types . One is self-standing ( like kwe ) and the other is a bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2 . We can now try a sentence in Marshallese : e-bat am jerabal , " You work slowly . " But what an inadequate translation this is of words that literally say " it-is-slow thy-property work . " Bound morphemes often distinguish number . In some languages , including Eskimo , it is conventional to distinguish three , not two , numbers  - -  namely , singular , plural , and dual . Many languages ( but not Eskimo ) also indicate the noun 's gender with bound morphemes . But this is not , as in French or German , always sex gender . In Cree the suffix of the transitive verb indicates whether an object belongs to the animate or inanimate gender . Thus : niiwaa'paman teta'puuwin " 1 see ( inanimate ) chair " niiwaa'pamaw ati 'm " I see ( animate ) dog " " Flour , " " man , " other animals , " snowshoes , " and several other nouns are animate . All others are inanimate . Cree speakers no more think of these distinctions when they use language than does a French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and to the dog with le ( masculine ) . In Navaho , nouns are categorized by the shape or size of the object to which they refer ( C. Kluckhohn and D. Leighton , 1946:Chap. 8 ) . Bound morphemes also may denote tense , but all languages are not equipped to specify the time when an action occurred . This happens to be an aspect of experience about which some people are relatively unconcerned . The Navaho Indians pay little attention to tense but their language is well equipped to designate the relative duration of an act . Word order may be important in constructing utterances . In English it makes a difference whether one says " The man ate the rabbit " or " The rabbit ate the man . " In Eskimo , word order is quite unimportant . In the dialect of Great Whale River , Quebec , one says either : i'nuk naxilaw'kuq ukolaca'miq " Man eats rabbit-miq " or ukolaca'miq naxilaw'kuq i'nuk " Rabbit-miq eats man . " In either case the bound form - miq suffixed to ukolacaq ( " rabbit " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Move that suffix to inuk ( " man " ) and the meaning definitely will be altered . A simple grammar might consist of only three parts of speech : nouns , used either as subjects or as objects ( NS and No respectively ) ; verbs , transitive and intransitive ( Vt and V ; respectively ) , and the truth-value marker ( T ) to indicate " yes " ( Charles E. Osgood and T. A. Sebcok , 1954:105-106 ) . Grammatical analysis might then yield four types of utterances to be used iu t he imaginary language : // 4 . While such simple syntax is not known for any living language , it serves nicely to illustrate how the linguist synthesizes grammatical patterns from people 's speech . Language and Perception Analysis of the phonemes and the free and bound forms of a language is sometimes called microlinguistics in distinction to another phase of the subject , metalinguistics . This is the attempt to study the relationship between language and thought or perception ( Trager , 1949 ) . The central assumption of metalinguistics ( also called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively distinct screen for sifting experience . The real world is largely a world whose form is a function of the way in which a community linguistically refers to elements of experience . No two languages do this in precisely the same way ( Sapir , 1929 ) . Different languages emphasize different components of experience . Some stress shape or size of objects ; others categorize the world by sex gender . Hopi has three tenses : past , future , and generalized ; a verb in the latter is timelessly true . To the ethnolinguist such processes in language imply that different languages govern speakers ' thought processes , albeit on an implicit level . Whereas the speaker of English says " when spring comes , " making " spring " an abstract nominal analogous to dogs , people , and other things that can arrive or go , the Cree language suggests the seasons to be unfolding or becoming . When the Cree Indian says eesiikwu'n he literally says " when it springs . " Does this imply a conception of nature different for Cree and English speakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitive answer to the question requires securing data on perceptual processes which are relatively independent of language . ' I'hose data could then be used to verify the role of language in perception ( M. B. Smith , 1954:63 ) . That language reveals a distinctive way of segmentalizing experience has been demonstrated . But perhaps too much should not be claimed for the fact that the Cree Indian , for example , linguistically identifies blue and green with a single linguistic form . After all , he can , if pressed , admit a distinction between those colors . His predicament ( if it is a serious predicament ) is analogous to the speaker of English who finds himself forced to distinguish different kinds of ice and snow . The reader could , if required , make such distinctions but not as briefly , perhaps , as does the I. ; skinio . The . Eskimo language contains many forms for designating different kinds of ice and snow . For example : sikuq , " ice on salt water " ; nilaq , " ice on fresh water " ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ; and // putaq , " broken drift ice . " When it becomes important to make significant new distinctions people usually originate or borrow linguistic means for doing so . Note the terms for elementary particles in physics . On the other hand , without the linguistic forms at hand it is possible that many distinctions in experience simply are ignored . The reader who has read through thirty or so chapters of this book has many more terms ( i.e. , concepts ) in his control for designating characteristics of culture than he possessed when he started reading . EXTRA-LINGUISTIC COMMUNICATION An extra-linguistic form of communication depends indirectly on language . The spoken forms of linguistic communication are , for example , represented graphically , or by dots and dashes , or are transmitted and reconstructed into sound electronically . Writing , the oldest extra-linguistic means of communicating facts and feelings , dates back to about 4000 years before the birth of Christ . Yet today , out of a world population of about 2 billion persons , 1 out of 4 can not read more than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leigh , 1946:4 ) . In Pakistan and India , where reading the Quran , Ramayana , or Mahabharata constitutes a meritorious and highly valued act , at least 80 percent of the population is nonliterate . Writing consists of using graphic signs or symbols to stand for audible ones  --  either unit sounds or syllables . Reading consists of reconverting the graphic representations into audible , or potentially audible , ones ( Krocher , 1948:235 ) . All writing is not extra-linguistic . Picture writing , which emphasizes the image , does not deWriting Is the Oldest Extralinguistic more than does a Boy Scout 's trail blaze ( Moorhouse , 1953:Chap. 1 ) . Such writing has nothing to do with language ; it is nonlinguistic . However , pictographic writing conics closer to true writing when independent signs ( i.e. , ideographs ) , standing for alp
