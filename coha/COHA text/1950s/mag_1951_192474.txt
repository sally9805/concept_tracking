Pickup ( Hugo Haas ; Columbia introduces Hollywood 's most promising new moviemaker since Producer Stanley ( Champion ) Kramer . The film , a simple drama with a high entertainment return on the $83,000 it cost to make , was produced , directed and co-scripted by Czech-born Hugo Haas , 49 , who also plays the leading role . <P> Sharp-sighted moviegoers may recognize Moviemaker Haas as a minor character actor who has specialized in heavies and buffoons ( King Solomon 's Mines , The Princess and the Pirate ) . In his U.S. debut as a cinematic Jack-of-all-trades , he uses a small cast of faces even less familiar than his own , and a setting consisting mainly of a railroad lineman 's shack along the desert route of the Southern Pacific . But he provides what too many pictures lack : an intriguing idea well suited to movie treatment , and the skill needed to bring it off . <P> Pickup is a story of an amiable , naive widower ( well played by Actor Haas ) living out a lonely middle age at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a carnival to buy a dog , he meets a calculating blonde floozy ( Beverly Michaels ) , who soon has him at the end of her leash . Unable to resist his $7,000 bank account , she marries him . Then , showing her contempt as broadly as she chews her gum , she waits around for a chance to get rid of her husband and get her hands on his bank account . <P> The chance comes when Haas goes stone deaf . While his pension is being arranged , the railroad sends a husky young replacement ( Allan Nixon ) to join him and his wife in the line shack . Haas suddenly regains his hearing in the shock of an automobile accident , but before he can tell anyone his exultant news , he runs into another shock . He hears Nixon wooing his wife , and his wife egging Nixon on to murder Haas-both blandly confident that he is deaf .

And with Pickup 's unromantic , middle-aged hero ( a role cut to the measure of France 's late Raimu ) , its sense of character , its tolerance of human frailty and its unglamorous backgrounds , he has produced a picture that is a far cry from the usual Hollywood product . <P> - <P> Hugo Haas waited almost a decade before resuming the career of scripter-director-actor that won him a reputation in Europe before World War II . After fleeing Czechoslovakia ( and later Paris ) a jump ahead of the Germans , he made his way to the U.S. Between a wartime job as an OWI broadcaster and stints on the stage in New York and Chicago , he learned enough English to get character roles in Hollywood . With German-born Scripter Arnold Phillips , he prepared the Pickup scenario from a Czech novel , then trudged around to independent producers trying to sell it .
