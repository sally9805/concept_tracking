From the pitcher 's mound the ball swooped in toward the plate in a lazy series of loops and parabolas , whooshed on past Eddie Robinson , clean-up hitter for the Chicago White Sox . Batter Robinson had never seen anything like it . Neither had thousands of viewers of last week 's Garroway-at-Large ( Sun . 10 p.m. , NBC-TV ) . But they have grown to expect such gimmicks in a show that has always scored high in imaginative camera tricks . <P> One week it was a tree bursting into full growth from an acorn planted a moment before . Another time it was a water pail apparently defying the law of gravitation . A regular Garroway feature is his " girl multiplier , " that once put 64 identical shots of pert Singer Bette Chapel on the TV screen at one time . Most of the stunts owe their success to a pair of studio carpenters named Weeland Risser and Ralph Doremus , who , in their pre-TV days , happened to work for Magicians Thurston and Blackstone . <P> Some of the tricks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operates on a spring released off stage by a prop man . Other tricks depend on shrewd camera work , as when dancers ' costumes change from black to white and , gradually , back to black again , simply by reversing the polarity ( i.e. , changing a positive picture to a negative picture ) on the camera . The falling and rising water pail was more complicated . A tiny pail the size of a thimble was mounted on a transparent plastic disc which revolved in front of a revolving drum on which the background was painted . By reversing the disc , the pail seemed to fall up or down ; by stopping both disc and drum , the pail seemed to stop in midair . Garroway 's " girl multiplier " is still on the top secret list , involves a translucent brick and operates on the prism principle . <P> Risser and Doremus think last week 's elaborately curving baseball is the best special effect they have ever devised , and jealously guard the details of its operation . To bring it off , they ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used a wide-angle lens to make the ball appear to travel much farther than the four feet it actually went . Says Producer Ted Mills : " We 're trying to think with our eyes . So far , everything we 've thought of , Risser and Doremus have been able to do . "
