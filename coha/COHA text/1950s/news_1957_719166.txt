txt Top agenda item , meeting of the International Monetary Fund , not long after V-J Day , 1945 : Currency convertibility . Top agenda item , meeting of the national Monetary Fund now going Washington : Currency convertibility . What is convertibility ? It 's simply the unhampered freedom to exchange at market prices one national . currency for another , whether In coin , in paper currency , or in debits and credits to bank deposit balances . When it exists , convertibility greatly facilitates international trade and investment . For thousands of years it did exist  --  the quiet and eminently successful lubricant of private enterprise . But no longer . Today the American businessman considering , say , a plant location in Britain , a franchised dealer in France , or closing a sale in Spain has to worry , aside from all his other problems , about a wringer called " exchange control , " the machinery of . inconvertibility . So in Londe ' ) the busineisman checks with the-Exchange Equalization Account Office , in Paris with the Office des Changes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In all these easel he finds he has to do business with a state monopoly with its usual trappings of red tape and bureaucracy . These are bad enough , but what really worries him is the suspicion that he may end up with far fewer dollars than he had first figured on . Champagne 's Complications The situation Is just as bad for European businessmen . The Parisian restaurateur who wants to buy an American automatic dishwasher applies to the government for the necessary dollars . The English pub owner who wants to stock up with French champagne for New Year 's Eve celebrations , asks his government for francs . The Spanish orange grower who has sold a shipload of oranges to Britain and would like to switch his sterling balance into dollars pleads with his government that he needs ? American orange-sorting machinery . In all these cases bureauciacy decides the crucial question of who gets- what and how much . Perhaps it 's theoretically possible that an all-wise and wholly impartial exchange system would duplicate the success of private enterprise  --  speed the trader or traveler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rigging in the rates of exchange . But such is not the case in practice . Licenses , priorities , quotas for imports and subsidies for exports , interstate clearing arrangements , shunting transactions . blocked currencies , balance of payments difficulties such as reflected by the recent French and Finnish devaluations  --  all these clutter and choke . trade and investment across international boundaries . And conference piled on conference have brought Etn'ope no closer to convertibility . Since inconvertibility has so many disadvantages , why do governments stubbornly persist in it ? One big reason is to mask domestic inflation , euphemistically known as the policy of " till employment . " When the supply of the home currency rises and the nation 's exports become freighted with higher wage and other costs , exports do n't do so well in world markets and non-inflated imports flood the country . A drainage of gold and foreign currencies sets in . In this situation inconvertibility temporarity ' permits the nation to maintain thefiction of an " official " exchange value for its currency , even though its value in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureaucracy can ration the critically short gold and foreign currencies for " vital " imports . These subterfuges , to be sure , ca n't stave off the day of reckoning forever ; in the end , only the government 's ? throwing in the sponge by devaluation will get the exchange controllers out of their fix and then only for as long as the inflation stops  --  which usually is n't very long. , - In addition to inflation , protectionism ranks high on the list of reasons for inconvertibility . Exchange control is just as powerful a means of curbing international trade as tariffs ; indeed , it is probably more effective . To stop imports from Ruritania which compete with home industries , the exchange control authorities merely have to tun ; off the faucet of Ruritanian currency . Hot Money Then there 's the question of preventing an outflow of capital , which in emergencies is dubbed " hot money. ? ' Capital is naturally the main building material to . strengthen a nation 's industrial machine . So , in a patriotic vein , the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hermetically sealing it within . the national borders through exchange control . The taxing mentality is also evident in the motivation for exchange control . The manipulation of foreign exchange rates can hardly be in anybody 's favor but the government 's . So the government frequently sets rates at levels which mean a heavy tax on importers , exporters , shippers , and tourists . Mostly the tax is indirect ; it 's shifted onto the nation 's consumers in the form of higher prices . Finally , an important reason for incon .. yertibility is the prevalent addiction to government controls . The objective of Dr. Hjalmar Schacht , Hitler 's finance wizard and exchange controller was autarky  --  economic self-sufficiency  --  to enable Germany to wage war . When that war came , the Allies felt exchange control was necessary for their own total mobilization . The resulting bureaucracy became a powerful lobby for the continuation of exchange control . Moreover , the pervasiveness of this tool for controlling an economy is alluring . It 's power to the nth degree . Once a government takes over dealings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a raw material or processing good that an individual firm or a certain industry requires . The government can thereby exercise life-anddeath economic power . Thus inconvertibility carries " the danger of collectivism , " as has been noted by Ludwig Erhard , West Germany 's economics minister and crusader for free enterprise . Floating Rates As a partial remedy , Dr. Erhard recommends a trial period of free convertibility for Europe . For a limited time each currency could attain its natural level through " floating " exchange rates . To soften any adversities ; however , each government could set limits to the flexibility of its rates . This would plainly be a step in the right direction . But it presupposes , among other things , that Europe has had its fill of Keynesian " full employment " inflationary policies . And that is very much to be doubted .
