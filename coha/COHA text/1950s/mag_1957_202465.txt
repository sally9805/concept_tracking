Past the pink neon , away from Hot Dog Johnnie 's and the Tower of Pizza , off the asphalt and under the elms , thousands of tourists were finding the peace of quiet ways and the charm of old things . Browsing through side-road antique stores , they gratefully swelled a business that has grown for four decades now , and keeps right on growing . Are antiques art ? The mid-19th century farmer who carved a mold for his wife to make cookies for his little daughter 's birthday would have smiled at the thought . He was an artist nonetheless , a creator of images and stretcher of imaginations in the days before TV . And unlike commercial art or entertainment , what he made had the warmth of his hands upon it . <P> At the artists ' colony of Woodstock , N.Y . last week , Hudson River valley antique dealers staged their annual fair of prize finds . The setting was itself an antique : a 60-ft. - long barn dating back to the middle of the 19th century . More than 1,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 2,000 items , ranging from buttons to bureaus . The ladies who put the show together were mostly grandmothers , but they smilingly shifted furniture that would have given a stevedore pause . As each unveiled her best discoveries , the others clustered like birds . A Civil War soldier 's shaving kit , with slide-out mirror , was admired for its ingenuity . Six people spread out a patchwork quilt , which some country lady had made from her husband 's neckties a century ago , and debated the name of the pattern . Said the oldest hand decisively , " Steps to the White House . " Price of the quilt , which must have cost many weeks of loving labor : $35 . In general , prices were not much higher than those of modern machine-made objects . <P> But imaginative , not monetary , values were what drew the crowds . Forty-five dollars bought a century-old bird cage patterned on a Gothic chapel ; no amount of money could ever buy the notion of creating such a thing . Eighty-five dollars bought a rocking horse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubtless earned over a million dollars in fantasy races . Best in show , perhaps , was an iron weather vane in the shape of a rooster , presented by an appropriately named antiquarian , Myra Tinklepaugh . " They 're hard to find , " Mrs. Tinklepaugh briskly allowed . " I 'm dickering for another one right now , not far away , only nobody wants to climb up to get it without insurance .
