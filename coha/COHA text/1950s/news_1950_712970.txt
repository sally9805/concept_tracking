txt Letters , to The Times Prison Camps in S. S. R. Treatment , Conditions Likened to Nazi Concentration Camps To.THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Few in America have heard about Karaganda . Karaganda is Siberia 's most notorious concentration camp , as well known throughout Russia and the satellite countries as Auschwitz during Nazi times . A relative of mine , Ede Bein , recently . arrived in New York , was taken to Russia as prisoner of war in 1943 . He spent five years in Karaganda . He was forced to march from the front lines in the terrible cold of the winter to a camp near Moscow . Guards ' beat those who dragged behind . The prisoners languished on starsyation rations on their way . The guards shot those prisoners who were too weak to continue their journey on foot . One can see that it is the very image of Nazi methods . The cattle cars in which they were taken from the environs of Moscow to Siberia were sealed in the same way as were the cattle cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where /German , Hungarian and Japanese prisoners work without safety measures , explosions , beatings and inadequate food are destroying the prisoners as they did in the coal mines of Auschwitz . As in Auschwitz , human life has no value . If a prisoner is beaten , , to death nobody need render account for his death . Death by Deprivation Listening to Ede Bein , I could see no difference between the camps of Auschwitz , Oranienburg , Sachsenhausen and Ohrdruf , where I had undergone so many hardships , and the camp of Karaganda . There are no gas-chambers in Karaganda or in the other thousands of Russian concentration camps . There were also no gas-chambers in the German camps in which I had been . People simply perished through beating , hunger and unbearably heavy work . The Hungarian National Council has collected material concerning Russian war prisoners ' camps . The facts were given by former prisoners of war who after many years returned to Hungary but had later escaped to one or other of the Western countries . The prisoners still in Russia in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions . Who will be the one to raise his voice ? Will it be the League of Human Rights ? Religious organizations ? Or one of the big powers who will pity them and take their case before the U. N. ? I have here before me the memorandum of Laszld Unghvary , a former professor of the university of Kolozsvdr , who managed to escape from a - Rumanian prison . He reports that bodies of prisoners who died on the way because of heat , lack of water and the overcrowding in the cattle cars were thrown out of the train . Deportation of : rows It is no secret that the Jews living in the western provinces of the Soviet Union are being deported to Siberia in the same way as the Volga Germans and the Tatars of the Crimea were deported . The thirty-five thousand Jews who were deported from Lvov. and taken to an unknown place of destination could be traced as far as Kiev . Everywhere on their way the M.V.D. closed the railway stations so that the cries of these unfortunates could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Ukraine , White Russia and the Crimea has been under progress for many months . These Jews were forced to go to unknown places and sure death because since the foundation of the State of Israel they are branded as individualists and nationalists by the Soviet Government . ? Has the world become so apathetic that no one is shocked at what is happening to these unfortunate people ? I , was a prisoner of war in Russia during the First World . War . I saw thousands of my comrades perish in the prisoners ' camps of Turkestan and Siberia . I saw the terrible manslaughter in the concentration camps of Auschwitz , Oranienburg , Sachsenhausen and Ohrdruf during World War II . We listened with trembling hearts to each broadcast of the Voice of America and of the B.B.C. , waiting for them to say a word about Auschwitz . Concentration camps are always the same . The unfortunate Hungarian and . other prisoners in the Russian concentration camps have surely by one way or other the means of listening to broadcasts . Just as we in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift up its voice , so that the lives of misery may become worth living again . BELA FABIAN , Member of the Executive Committee of the Hungarian National Council . New York , June 9 , 1950 . To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your recent editorial concerning the cost of the farm support program did not touch on one item that affects almost every consumer 's pocketbook ? butter . In 1949 the Department of Agriculture kept butter prices up by paying between 59 cents and 62 cents a pound for all the Grade A butter offered anywhere in the United States . This encouraged production and discouraged consumption . By the end of the year the Government was obliged to buy ? v ? 100 million pounds of butter . Unable to move any but a small fraction of this butter , the Government kept it in cold storage , where large quantities of it still are . At the beginning of this year the Government announced that it would pay 60 cents for a period of fifteen months from that date . The peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does n't start until the summer months . But in 1950 they have had to buy and store millions of pounds . By the end of this summer the Government will own astronomical amounts of butter . A somewhat lower support price would have encouraged much larger consumption . Reasonably lower prices would not hurt any dairy farmer ; in fact , many deplore the high support price of butter , knowing that it discourages consumption . Normally the price of butter in the big producing sections of . the Middle West is somewhat lower than in Eastern cities because of freight costs . The Department of Agriculture pays the same price for butter all over the United States . I think one of the main faults of the support program is the fact that too much power is put into the hands os minor Department of Agriculture officials  --  who are ( given millions af dollars with which to buy and sell food products and who have never had actual experience in the food business ; certainly not in handling large quantities . In discussing the high cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taxes used up . But I think the main cost is carried by the consumer . In fact , consumers pay twice , in a higher cost for their fooc and in taxes to maintain high prices . ALBERT LOWENFELS . New York , June 7 , 1950 . Cemetery of Keats and Shelley To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I was both interested and puzzled by an item in the THE TIMES of May 31 , stating that Gustav Davidson had sailed for Italy with money to be used in the restoration of the graves of Shelley and Keats in the " now war-ravaged Protestant Cemetery " in Rome . I visited the cemetery in August , 1949 . The grave of Keats , in the ' and now disused part of the cemetery looked unkempt and had suffered from drought , like other parts of the city . Shelley 's grave , however , is in the newer part and was in good condition . Rome was , of course , an open city , and neither the cemetery nor other parts of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely neglected , however , and certainly the fund Mr. Davidson is taking to Rome will be of great use in restoring these graves to the beauty they deserve . DOROTHY TYLER . Detroit , June 8 , 1950. the city and thus rate only one daily delivery . To say nothing of dropping innumerable post office employes . Another example : To be unable to weigh and insure a parcel post package after 6 P. M. in a city of over seven million population maintaining the enormous commercial enterprises existing in New York makes these schedules , which are comparable to any village or hamlet in the United States , ridiculous and out of all reason . Surely the three main post offices could be kept open for services after 6 P. M. , for financial services on Saturdays , and all services for reasonable hours on Sundays and holidays . This directive is issued under the guise of economy , but with the flagrant waste and other unnecessary astronomic expenditures being made daily by the Government , which come out of the taxes paid by an already overburdened citizenry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some other branch of our Government where not everyone in this country would be ultimately affected in some manner . AN IRATE TAXPAYER . New York , June 8 , 1950 . Maintaining Farm Prices Results of Supporting Butter Prices Cited in Criticizing Program who Senate Critics Praised To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Congratulations on your editorial of June 3 entitled " Plain Talk in the Senate . " It is indeed " high time that some responsible Republicans " spoke up . Mrs. Smith 's ? talk lifted the whole controversy out of the realm of party bickering to a facing of the real issues . More power to her and the papers that back her . ANNE S. GOODRICH . New York , June 9 , 1950 . Curtailed Postal Service Protested To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The recent directive from the Post Office Department to close all services to the public at 6 P. M. daily , and all day Sundays and holidays at all its stations , is incredible . Box collections are curtailed to 7 P.M. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail delivery. - in so-called residential areas . To the millions who depend upon the mails in their daily existence and business activities , this is quite a hardship . Business is everywhere and can hardly be . segregated to particular sections of A Day to Display Flags To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : June 14 is Flag Day , the birthday of the Stars and Stripes . Woodrow Wilson 's words in designating the first official Flag Day in 1915 have even more impact today . " * * * The benefit of a day like this is merely in turning away from the things that distract us , turning away from the things that touch us personally and absorb our interest in the hours of daily work . We remind ourselves of those things that are greater than we are , of those principles bar which we believe our hearts to be elevated , of the more difficult things that we must undertake in these days of perplexity when a man 's judgment is safest only when it follows the line of principle * * * . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a reminder to all good citizens to fly the national emblem on its birthday , June 14 ?
